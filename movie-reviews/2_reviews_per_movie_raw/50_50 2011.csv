","As someone who was diagnosed with cancer two years ago (non-small cell lung cancer--and a nonsmoker to boot!) I've been through the gantlet, from 4 different kinds of chemo, several surgeries, and a wide variety of medical care from indifferent to deeply caring. So, trust me when I tell you, that this movie gets it.<br/><br/>It gets what it is like to receive a horrific diagnosis out of the blue, the numbness and shock of dealing with it, the well meaning friends and acquaintances who say the stupidest things (""every time I feel sorry for myself, I just think of you...""), and those friends who really become your rock as you go through the miasma of treatment and try to still make your life have meaning. Again, this movie gets it.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt and Seth Rogen deserve high praise for the honesty that they bring to their performances. There was not a false note anywhere. The rest of the cast is terrific as well. I plan to see it again when it is released in a month.<br/><br/>This is a quiet film but it packs a great deal of power. I thought the humor was wonderfully placed, because without humor, life with cancer is unbearable. As too many folks know so well. Go see it and be entertained and learn a bit and rejoice in life even with cancer."
"jdesando","Null","89","103","28 September 2011"," It's a balancing act.
","How does a filmmaker combine humor and drama in a story about a 27 year old man diagnosed with cancer? Easy: Just give them equal measure with the title 50/50 -- light treatment of a dark subject.<br/><br/>Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has to deal not only with his own emotions when he is diagnosed, but also those of a close friend, Kyle (Seth Rogen), an inveterate partier and ribald quipper, and his chronically worrisome mother (Anjelica Huston). Losing his girlfriend, Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) along the way adds to the potential downbeat. <br/><br/>Yet director Jonathan Levine and writer Will Reiser keep it all as upbeat as possible, not in small part due to Rogen's constantly funny chatter, which comes at just the right times as the plot gets heavy with cancer surviving techniques (the film turns out to show the way to battle: with humor). <br/><br/>Of course, Rogen has had training playing a similar role in Funny People with Adam Sandler. No one plays a weed-smoking buddy better than he. Gordon-Levitt is also an actor who can just about better than anyone else play the soulful, endearing, slow-moving romantic as he did in (500) Days. As a cancer victim, he engages the audience in observation of a vulnerable hero, who fights with a serenity and equanimity that could be a model for those wishing to survive and those who wish to help.<br/><br/>50/50 is a comedy with compassion, a distant cousin to the prevalent bromances that rarely treat the support men give each other in times of real danger. Usually it's vacuous women who supply that danger and significant support. Hooray for the men this time."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","124","147","30 September 2011"," The perfect balance between drama and comedy, '50/50' depicts cancer the right way
","Most movies don't know how to handle cancer. Heck, most people don't know how to handle cancer — and I'm not talking about the patients. Cancer, or any other terminal illness for that matter, almost always plays some kind x-factor in a film — that is when a film even dares to enter a realm often deemed depressing and ""not for the movies."" Most often, scripts will position cancer as a tearjerking emotional turning point in a film or as the initial spark of some banal ""live life to the fullest"" comedy.<br/><br/>""50/50"" puts an end to that. Written semi-autobiographically by cancer survivor Will Reiser, it would seem it takes one to write one. Although cancer drives the entire story, the story doesn't fixate on cancer or melodramatize the terrible truths we already know about potentially fatal illness. Perhaps you could tell as much from the trailer thanks to some typical Seth Rogen antics, but the injection of contemporary R-rated humor is neither irreverent, insensitive nor an attempt to simply put a positive spin on a depressing subject. Life — believe it or not — doesn't stop for cancer. People don't sit in the hospital the entire time and then lie at home in bed the rest. Reiser's story provides a mostly unforced and honest depiction of a young man's diagnosis and treatment for potentially fatal spinal cancer, one where cancer isn't the conflict in and of itself, but the way it so dramatically changes the behavior of the people whose lives it enters and positively and negatively alters relationships.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues his spree of playing absolutely lovable main characters as Adam, a play-it-safe 27-year-old who after the initial shock handles his diagnosis in stride, keeping his ups and downs internal other than when the script cues him to let it out a bit. The more external symptoms come from Adam's girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) and mother (Anjelica Huston).<br/><br/>Other than focusing on these relationships, director Jonathan Levine (""The Wackness"") puts particular emphasis on character perspective, which will change instantaneously at points throughout the film. In one terrific sequence, Adam enters the hospital for his first chemo treatment and gets bummed out by all the sick and ailing people in the hallway. After the older men he meets while getting treatment (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) give him some marijuana-filled pastries, he leaves down the same hallway high as a kite, suddenly elated despite the same negative images lining the hall. Levine understands that so much of how you deal with cancer relates to mood and perspective at any given time.<br/><br/>Levine coaxes brilliant and thoughtful performances out of his actors. Even though Rogen exerted his usual shtick a bit more than needed, he handles his character as written, someone who wants desperately to help his best friend but hides behind shallow self-centered form of support that many men turn to because they can't communicate emotions all that well.<br/><br/>The women of ""50/50"" also deliver if not more so. Howard's character is an unlikable mess but she gives her performance convincingly. Anjelica Huston perfects the ideal on-screen mother, the best since Melissa Leo's Oscar-winning mother in ""The Fighter."" Anna Kendrick also continues to blow me away with her talent. She plays a psychiatrist working on her PhD who receives Adam as just her third patient. She gives such lifelike quirks to her characters and Katie plays right to her strengths.<br/><br/>But in a drama/comedy about cancer, the key lies in tone and for that Levine should become an A-list director. ""50/50"" could have easily turned into a Hollywood hack-job like the various comic-toned cancer films before it, a film that either overplays the dramatic or overcompensates with the humorous, but ""50/50"" might be one of film's best balancing acts between the two. The shifts feel completely natural between moments of deep sentiment and moments of levity. Those who can't help but fixate on this being a movie about cancer will likely have to remind themselves to feel serious when ""50/50"" just wants you to simply absorb it as you would any other film.<br/><br/>Other than some predictable moments and plot devices to give the film a nicer Hollywood sheen, ""50/50"" provides a genuine and heartfelt movie experience, one that neither goes for the emotional sucker punch nor the sugarcoated version. Instead of making us look at cancer in a specific way, it makes us look at the way we look at cancer — or any uncomfortable subject — the way we talk about it or don't talk about it, the way we interact with those who live with it and the way we cope with it ourselves. That way when someone we love has a serious problem, we can ultimately do what's best for that person.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site, moviemusereviews.com!"
"Cunnilingilator","10","257","317","14 March 2011"," A Great Film
","Just saw this at an Advanced Screening 2 hours ago in Huntington Beach <br/><br/>This film doesn't have a title nailed down yet. It used to be called I'm with Cancer but IMDb has it listed as Live With It. The title we were shown in the film and the title that was on the invite was Get Well Soon. They asked us our opinion of the titles (Also include was the title Bright Side) but no one really liked any of the titles. So for the sake of confusion I'll call it Get Well Soon. <br/><br/>Get Well Soon is the very believable story of Adam, a 27 year old nice guy who waits at cross walks at 5:30 in the morning when nobody is on the road and other joggers have already trotted past. Adam writes stories for radio programs and seems to genuinely care about the stories and the people who are listening to them. After persistent back pain, Adam goes to the doctor and is diagnosed with Cancer. He is assigned Katherine, a doctorate student who is getting experience for her dissertation, to talk to about his new problems. <br/><br/>This film will immediately draw comparisons to 2009's Funny People which unfortunately can't be ignored. But fortunately, aside from the fact the main character is diagnosed with a terminal illness, this is a completely different film. Where Funny People had a lack of connection with its main character, due to Adam Sandler being a prick to everyone and being rich on top of that, Get Well Soon's Joseph Gordon Levitt is the everyman that everyone can relate to. He does a fantastic job expressing the feelings of calm fortitude as well as isolation. You can see it in his face. It's the little things that make a film feel authentic. Levitt's performance is heart breaking and uplifting at the same time. He maintains a steady calm for most of the film that just feels real. You know this is a dark comedy when there is a Patrick Swayze joke in the first 20 minutes of the movie. I'm not sure if that one's gonna stay in the final cut though lol. This film is very funny throughout. All of the people in the after film focus group said it maintained a perfect balance of comedy and dramatics. I saw Love and Other Drugs and liked it but this film is much more streamlined and has no extraneous scenes. <br/><br/>Seth Rogen is absolutely hilarious. I'll be the first to get my opinion out that Rogen is great in everything he's in but he really killed it again. Weed smoking is given a fantastic treatment by this film, like director Jonathon Levine's previous work the very amusing The Wackness. There are two scenes that are a creative and effective way to show the effects of marijuana. I love the way they shot a conversation between Adam, Rogen and two of Adam's older cancer friends. Anna Kendrick plays a similar role to the one she played in Up in the Air. She does a great job in this too. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Adam's girlfriend and Angelica Huston is his over bearing mother. <br/><br/>I rated this film an ""Excellent"" which is the highest possible rating and which 18 of the 30 people who stayed after agreed with. 11 said ""Very Good"" and 1 said ""Good."" I really enjoyed the film. It didn't really do anything wrong. It might have a bit too much profanity for the older crowd but its central story is so appealing. On that note actually, there were several people who said they would not have come to the screening if they knew full well that it was about cancer. I feel that is so extremely narrow minded that no one should even admit that to a group of people. Please if you are on the fence and ""don't want to go to a depressing movie"" get over it and see a fantastic, hilarious film in Get Well Soon."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The great Richard Pryor had a portion of his act dedicated to having a heart attack, based on his real life experience. I guess if he can generate laughter from a coronary, there is no reason writer Will Reiser and director Jonathan Levine (The Wackness) can't view Cancer as Comedy. There is little doubt that the subject matter of this film will limit its audience, but for those brave souls who give it a shot, I believe you will find it funny, touching and insightful.<br/><br/>The film introduces us to Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is a very nice, very normal, very low-key guy who works at a radio station as a writer ... a very conscientious radio writer. Adam experiences a nagging pain in his back, which is unusual for a healthy 27 year old. After a few tests, the emotionless doctor informs him that he has a rare spinal cancer ... also very unusual for a healthy 27 year old. From this point forward, the film borders on brilliance at times.<br/><br/>Adam's girlfriend is played by Bryce Dallas Howard; his mother by Angelica Huston; and his best friend by Seth Rogen. Each reacts in different ways to Adam's diagnosis, but what's really interesting is not just how these people react, but also how Adam reacts. He moves forward in his meticulous manner, but all the while we know the emotions are brewing. We see this in his sessions with his therapist-in-training played by Anna Kendrick.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen's character is basically a carbon copy of his act in 40 Year Old Virgin. He spews profane one-liners faster than our ears can process. Despite the aggressive front, Rogen's character is a friend with a heart ... and one who doesn't hesitate to share his medicinal marijuana.<br/><br/>So while Rogen's character generates much of the laughter, the real treasure of this film is in the subtleties of each character in certain moments ... and each character has their moment. Many will compare this to Adam Sandler's film Funny People, which also starred Seth Rogen. But this movie has infinitely more depth and substance than that one offered.<br/><br/>My warning: brace yourself. My theatre was filled with tears and sniffles, with significant laugh out loud moments mixed in. This is an emotional, self-reflective film that will confound you as you inexplicably laugh while listening to cancer talk."
"KnightsofNi11","8","89","108","30 September 2011"," Hilarious and touching at the same time
","Mixing cancer and comedy doesn't seem like it should go so well, but 50/50 is a film that makes it work. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Adam, a 27 year old easy going guy who unexpectedly gets diagnosed with cancer. The film details his struggle to beat the disease and all the hardships that come along with having to fight a disease as crippling as cancer at such a young age. Adam is surrounded by various other people in his life that all influence him in different ways. Seth Rogen plays his best friend, Kyle, who always tries to help Adam out, but doesn't always know how to go about it. Anna Kendrick plays Adam's therapist, Katherine, whose attempts to help Adam cope with the cancer work at times, but at other times she just can't find the right way to connect with the grieving youngster. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Adam's girlfriend and Anjelica Houston is one of the strongest characters, Adam's overprotective mother. The film is a compassionate tale of love and friendship while simultaneously being a raunchy pothead comedy. The overlap is strange, but it works incredibly well.<br/><br/>There are so many ways to do a comedy film about cancer wrong, but very few ways to do it right. 50/50 thankfully manages to find the sweetspot of this risky terrain and succeeds in being a charmingly touching film as well as a wildly hilarious one. The writer of the film, Will Reiser, based the film on his own experiences with fighting and beating cancer at a young age, and his passion and understanding of this story shine beautifully through the film and its characters which surely all resemble Reiser's own friends and family in some way. 50/50 doesn't lean too far to either side of the comedy versus drama spectrum and it always maintains a consistent level of heartwarming hilarity balanced with touching sincerity. The drama and comedy weave in and out of each other perfectly and seamlessly with neither genre feeling inappropriate or out of place. It is sincere filmmaking at its finest.<br/><br/>Moreover, 50/50 just does a great job with its balance of genres, but also with the overall story and the great characters within that story. We grow such passionate empathy for Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a way I never thought could be possible. The film draws us into his troubled world so well and we are rooting for him all the way, cheering on his every move and growing more and more attached to him with every passing moment. We also grow to love the supporting cast who, with the exception of one particular character but I won't spoil anything, support Adam through all his hard times. The characters are all so well written and they play their key roles in Adam's life perfectly. 50/50 is a movie structured to where every character serves a major purpose in furthering Adam's development as well as the development of the plot. And so as we watch the relationships between Adam and the people in his life grow and fade we develop a deeper understanding of his character, making 50/50 an incredibly human story.<br/><br/>It's always nice to be so surprised by a film's quality. I expected good things from 50/50 from the first time I saw a trailer, but the movie itself exceeded my expectations. It is what the dramady subgenre is all about. It is a film tailor made to be the subgenre's posterchild. I laughed, I lamented, and I was brought close to tears at how heartwarming and touching of a film 50/50 is."
"xfirerushx","10","110","139","1 October 2011"," Considering it as one of my fav movies
","50/50 has pretty much everything an amazing movie like this can offer. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and you'll come out of the theater very satisfied. I cried for about a whole straight 20 minutes in total and laughed or glued my eyes to the screen the rest of the time. This movie will make you not only appreciate all the work went into it, but it will make you appreciate life itself. It is so brutally realistic. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Seth Rogen are a great duo and the supporting cast does a great job as well. This movie was made with respect for its viewers. It takes something so serious and so taboo to laugh at and makes it a comedy and a drama. It exceeds in both genres. If I am correct, this movie is somewhat based on the Screenwriter's life who also went through something very similar and most of the events in the film are based on things he had to go through as he also got cancer in his 20s.<br/><br/>Go see 50/50! You will not regret it at all! I am considering it for one of my favorite movies, but I think that is just a bit too soon as I need to have multiple viewings to judge if a movie is one of my favorites. I can guarantee one thing. 50/50 is an instant classic!"
"Scarecrow-88","8","9","9","22 June 2013"," 50/50
","I think what makes 50/50 such a success is the film doesn't ever feel like it needs to manipulate your emotions, as many a movie about cancer falls prey to, instead just looking at a life through a realistic lens from the perspective of a young man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) having to deal with a tumor growing on his spine. He has an obscene (but totally loyal) buddy played by Seth Rogan, always drunk, hitting on girls, and swearing (when not smoking pot and trying to convince Gordon-Levitt to go to bars with him), a sham of a girlfriend (played by Bryce Dallas Howard, stuck with a character so self-absorbed, with a personality ill-equipped for giving care and affection to someone in need of both, that she has no chance of escaping the ""bitch we love to hate""; it does provide a moment of great humor when Gordon-Levitt tells her to get of his porch, soon joining Rogan in destroying her painting that once hung above the television), a psychiatrist working on her doctorate and a bit inexperienced (Anna Kendrick, becoming quite a character actress; if she could just avoid the ""Pitch Perfect"" films, I think the sky's the limit) who is becoming a possible new love interest, an overprotective mother (Angelica Huston, just wonderful) who just wants her son to return her phone calls (and make him dinner if he'll let her) he's embarrassed by, a father now lost to senility, and a couple of fellow cancer patients (Matt Frewer and Philip Baker Hall) who understand his situation all too well. Learning of the cancer (I think there's a great bit of cinematography here were the focus of the cancer doc's face (still speaking of the rarity of such cancer in someone of his age) eventually fades with Gordon-Levitt having to let this news sink in), cutting of his hair (with Rogen's shaver which could have been used for his body hair), dealing with a cheating girlfriend that abandoned him when he needed her the most (caught at her art gallery with a hippie by Rogan who snaps a photo on his phone), trying to avoid as much of revealing his pent up emotions to his psychiatrist yet finding her presence in his life a gradual help, facing the fears of dying and the eventual delicate and dangerous surgery, and ultimately blessed with a new outlook on life (and perhaps love). This is indeed uplifting but not in the usual Lifetime/Hallmark channel way; the dialogue is frank and profane, emotional outbursts (or scenes where Gordon-Lewitt is sick and too tired to stand) aren't overdramatized with a heavy score, and there's plenty of adult comedy that can offset the grim diagnosis that heavily looms throughout. Rogan is playing another version of himself; using the cancer to pick up girls, boozing and oftentimes drunk, blunt and viewed as obnoxious (and not without plenty of dirty jokes and salty language), this character doesn't stray from Rogan's comfort zone. Yet he's there for his friend all the way. Gordon-Levitt proves here, significantly, that he's among the best actors of his generation. Scary is I think he still can get even better."

","Adam, a 27-year-old public radio editor, discovers one day that the aches and pains that have been plaguing him signal a frightening reality: He has cancer, with a 50/50 shot of beating the odds. As he undergoes chemotherapy, Adam begins to confront his relationships and friendships, questioning whether they're satisfying and meaningful -- and, if not, what he needs to do about them. For example, is his girlfriend the right girl for him? Can his best friend deal with his illness? Should he trust his new therapist? And, this goes on.50/50 faces so many hurdles on its way to success. There are so many clichés that a movie about terminal illness has to skirt: How to handle the reveal without being over-dramatic? Should there be a transformation -- and, if so, how to make it believable? Far from being sappy and mawkish, the movie is unafraid to ask difficult questions: Does illness allow you to put yourself first all the time? How much can you ask of others when you're sick? And it's bold enough to mine the situation for hilarity without minimizing it or going for the easy jokes. That said, it's not perfect by any means; Adam's girlfriend turns needlessly villainous, and a storyline about Adam's father could have used more depth but instead peters out. But ultimately, it takes confidence to create a movie like this one, we can root for easily and without pity. When you see 50/50, be prepared to laugh and think."

","Adam (Gordon-Levitt) is a rule-following, mild-mannered twentysomething who lives in Seattle with his girlfriend, Rachael (Bryce Dallas-Howard), and works at Seattle Public Radio. His life takes a sudden and dramatic turn when he is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer that has taken over his spine. A laidback kind of guy, Adam handles each hurdle with surprising ease and levity while engaging in somewhat helpful counseling from Katie (Anna Kendrick), a young psychologist the hospital assigns him. Before long, though, his complex relationships with Rachael, his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), and his needy mother (Angelica Huston) become even more convoluted with the introduction of chemotherapy and medicinal marijuana into his life. As the severity of his condition increases, Adam begins to reassess his life, his relationships, and the nonplussed façade he uses to get himself through.<br/><br/>The inevitable comparisons between ""50/50"" and 2009's ""Funny People"" are unfortunate. While I stuck up for ""Funny People"" more than most of my colleagues, even I will admit it is an incredibly flawed film that misses the mark on many levels. ""50/50"", then, plays out a bit like what ""Funny People"" should have been, right down to the performance of Seth Rogen. It is, first and foremost, a very funny movie and that is where ""Funny People"" first went awry. You can't make a comedy about cancer, or any other serious illness for that matter, and fail to produce a genuinely funny script. Laughs come often and organically. I also quite liked that writer Will Reiser (who based his script on the events of his own battle with cancer) makes it clear early on that he intends to laugh at cancer and if you're not up for that, you're in the wrong theater. That is not to say that the disease itself or the havoc it wreaks on Adam's life is disrespected or ignored; in fact, ""50/50"" gives a fairly realistic view of the hell that is aggressive cancer and the sometimes even more aggressive treatment. ""50/50"" is bold but soft, a combination that works well.<br/><br/>The dialogue between the characters in ""50/50"" flows with tremendous ease, especially in the scenes involving Adam and Kyle. This dynamic between JGL and Rogen is the meat of the film and the two play it out brilliantly. They have a chemistry that Anne Hathaway only wishes she could develop withwell, anyone. (That was an unnecessary shot at Miss Hathaway. My apologies.) They reminded me of the type of friendship I might have with any one of my closer pals if we cursed more and occasionally smoked pot. Adam's other relationships are a bit awkward but whether this was done on purpose or not, it serves the narrative well. In my mind he would have a tense partnership with Rachael because they're clearly not suited for each other and any furtherance of his friendship with Katie beyond doctor-patient would be a bit odd. <br/><br/>All of the supporting actors hold their own. As spot-on as I might have been with JGL all those years ago, I would have never guessed, after reluctantly watching ""Twilight"", that Kendrick would be an actress whose performances I truly look forward to. This isn't quite to the level of her work in ""Up in the Air"" but it is good and believable nonetheless. Huston's character seems a bit over-the-top in the early going but the depth of her character comes to light in the late stages and Huston pulls it together splendidly. And Rogen gives what might be his best performance to date. To be fair, I'm not much of a Rogen fan so I'm far from an expert on his value as an actor. But whereas he was completely outclassed in ""Funny People"" and pretty much plays the same character in almost every film, he shows a little more strength in ""50/50"" than he ever has before (with the possible exception of ""Knocked Up""). I actually liked him and I haven't felt that way toward him very often.<br/><br/>But of course, the weight of ""50/50"" rests almost entirely on the shoulders of JGL and he holds up to the challenge. One of the best compliments I can give an actor is to say that he and his character become one and the same. That's what JGL does here and that's why ""50/50"" succeeds. He envelopes himself into the Adam character and makes his portrayal incredibly believable. It is almost like watching a documentary on a young cancer patient. Adam handles his disease with class and dignity but not without emotion. His outbursts are few but powerful and through them JGL sells the story beautifully. Simply put, this guy is a star and ""50/50"" serves as the announcement of such to those of you who didn't already know this to be fact.<br/><br/>""50/50"" is honest and at times tough to watch but never purposefully harsh or depressing. In fact, it is generally positive but in a way that isn't all sunshine and unicorns. It is smart, hilarious, and even touching while all the time remaining respectful of the audience's ability to relate to difficult circumstances without artificial emotional fishing. It is an excellent film marked by one outstanding performance that deserves the attention received come Award Season."

","After playing a bad boy rocker with a full head of hair, Joseph Gordon-Levitt now plays a nervous Cancer-patient with no hair at all. 50/50 is loosely based on the story of Will Reiser, who wrote this film, and is telling us his story and struggle through the character Adam.<br/><br/>Adam is played by Levitt, a marvelous actor who is continuing his string of quirky, yet well made independent films where he plays an off-the-wall protagonist. Adam is twenty-seven and works for a Seattle radio company. He is informed that he has a rare form of Cancer called Neurofibrosarcoma, and is told he only has a 50% chance of living with it. Frustrated, but moving day by day in a seemingly calm manner with his buddy Kyle (Rogen), Adam continues his long journey only to be bothered by his annoying, self-centered girlfriend (Howard) frequently. Through thick and thin, Adam starts to cope with his disease and manages to stay calm for most of the picture.<br/><br/>We all have to die at one point. It's part of the life. But I can't imagine the sadness and calamity brought upon someone who finds out they have a rare form of Cancer and that their chances of living are fifty-fifty. At twenty-seven nonetheless. My mother, who has work in a Chemotherapy unit for about a decade, said that the youngest she has even seen someone die from Cancer is two and a half years old. Some people, hardly get to experience life at firsthand because of Cancer.<br/><br/>There are so many forms of Cancer, rare and common, harmless and not, that your chances of getting it are very high. Getting it is at random, but coping with it is even harder. While 50/50 has a heartbreaking, and is sometimes emotion-testing and tear-jerking, it still has a strong comedic relief thanks to Seth Rogen, who is rather unfairly bashed in a majority of his films.<br/><br/>The acting is superb by both leads, the parents of Adam played by Angelica Houston and Serge Houde are portrayed effectively and in a loving way, and the screenplay and Johnathan Levine's direction never fails or works against this film in any way. Three years prior he was creating good chemistry between Ben Kingsley and Josh Peck in The Wackness. Now, he's finally mastered in creating two characters that do nothing but sparkle when on screen together. You can't really call this a Seth Rogen film because while his comedy is here, his underlying sweetness shows through the cloth of this film more than it has ever done before. The last time he gave a performance this well done was in Sandler's Funny People.<br/><br/>Thanks to a wonderful third act in terms of direction and screenplay, you get an all out emotional breakdown from the characters and yourself. 50/50 has a way with making emotional moments not seemed contrived, but welcomed. I think out of everyone in the theater, my mom was more emotional than the average person in the general public which is understandable.<br/><br/>Many films have come out this year, and many have been ignored. Comedies and dramas alike have been swept under the bus with other blockbusters in theaters at the same time. I plan on doing a list of the top ignored and underrated films of 2011. I hope 50/50 doesn't make that list.<br/><br/>Starring: Joesph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen, Bryce Dallas-Howard, Angelica Houston, and Serge Houde. Directed by: Johnathan Levine."

","I thought this was a better film than ""The King's Speech"" or ""Social Network"" my two favorite films of last year. Nothing this year has come close so far to the sheer brilliance of 50/50. It is the best ""disease of the week"" film ever made, which sounds like a backhanded compliment but I don't know how to describe the genre any better.<br/><br/>I have always felt that Gordon-Levitt along with Gosling are far and away the two best young actors working today. I thought that Gordon-Levitt deserved an Oscar nomination for ""The Lookout"" but knew that was never going to happen. This is his time. His performance as a young man battling cancer is pitch perfect. You will laugh and cry along with him throughout his difficult journey. His best scenes are with his therapist played by Anna Kendrick. She was good in the overrated ""Up in the Air""; she is great in this film, playing another neophyte in a high powered career. She will be nominated as well, no doubt.<br/><br/>Seth Rogan has the role of his career thanks in part to Will Reiser, the screenwriter, who was able to take the whole sexist, slacker, pothead thing that Rogan does and add a dimension of humanity. I think both of them also deserve Oscar nominations. Because of the nature of his role I would be surprised if Rogan gets one, but not too surprised. He is just hilarious and at times very touching.<br/><br/>Finally we come to Jonathan Levine, a director that I had never heard of prior to this film. He is fantastic with actors here and has a great style. I say he is a shoo in come Oscar time.<br/><br/>Now this review has really centered around Oscar and that is for a reason. It will not be released for awhile and I was lucky to see a preview screening in Denver last night. I could think of no other way to get the point across more clearly that this is a brilliant film that you must run to when it is released.<br/><br/>One more thing. I made the mistake of taking my 13 year old daughter thinking the R rating was more about the pot and the language, and that the message of the film would overcome those issues. I kind of regret it. I really don't mind her having seen the film in an overall context because the message is terrific, but man was it raunchy and uncomfortable to sit through with her."

","How many drama movies about cancer treatment, with suffering performances and a true story of overcoming have been made and even became tiresome way? Well, the young director Jonathan Levine and Will Reiser (screenplay) found a formidable new vision of it all.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young man of twenty-seven years working for a radio company in Seattle. He is informed that he has a rare form of cancer called ""Neurofibrosarcoma"", and is told he only has a 50% chance to live with him. Frustrated, but moving day to day with a seemingly calm, with the help of his friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), Adam continues his long journey of recovery. Only to be bothered by his irritating, selfish girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard). But with the help of the, half embarrassed but very helpful, psychologist Katherine (Anna Kendrick). Adam then proceeds to deal with their illness and can remain calm during most part of the film.<br/><br/>There are so many forms of cancer, rare and common, harmless and that their chances of getting it are very high. Start is random, but dealing with it is even more difficult. While ""50/50"" is a moving, and sometimes it is emotion-test and tearful, he still has a strong comic relief thanks to Seth Rogen, and several occasions that Adam and Kyle meddle.<br/><br/>The film is a drama, that works as a comedy very well written. Some may find this a defect, but rather a quality. Adam throughout the film faces its situation near death in a lively manner. It's as if the film were telling us, ""if it is your last minutes, let then be smiling!"".<br/><br/>The cast is terrific, even comic, Seth manages to have an interesting dramatic performance; Anna Kendrick formidable as ever; Angelica Houston and Serge Houde as Adam's parents with great performances; but who shines above everyone is Joseph Levitt with a fantastic performance, proving to be an very promising actor.<br/><br/>Thanks to a wonderful third act, in terms of direction and screenplay that never fail or work against the film at any time, the public has an emotional breakdown all of the characters and the story itself and fantastic to witness."

","Actually at first I didn't think that 50/50 can effect me deeply . Because it's name didn't give a clue about the story. Then I read the story's main theme I realized. 50/50 is an original story about friendship, love, survival and finding humor in unlikely places.This is a tragedy inspired by real events about a young man named Adam who, despite living a healthy lifestyle is diagnosed with a very serious and rare type of spinal cancer. Gordon-Levitt turns depression and despair into comedy. His chances of survival are 50/50, and the bulk of the film is basically a fish out of water story that follows him as he tries to deal with his situation with the help of his vulgar but well meaning best friend Kyle, his overbearing mother Diane, his cold, cruel girlfriend Rachael, and his kind, but young and inexperienced therapist Katherine."

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance in this movie is spot-on. The emotions, thoughts, and feelings portrayed in this movie are spot on.<br/><br/>I'll say this: having had cancer, everything in this movie is very relatable. I'm sure those of you who have also had cancer can agree with me. For the rest of you, I can't say much more than that for me it's relatable: which in my opinion is one of the main dimensions of great movies. Can the viewer relate to the story? From the other reviews it appears the movie does a pretty good job of getting a typical viewer hooked via that hook.<br/><br/>As for the writing of movie, it's not GREAT (but it's good), and often fairly predictable, but not in a cliche way.

"ArtandJoyofMovies","Null","9","13","5 October 2011"," 50/50 hits the mark 100%
","This is a good film. It is a very good film. I was tempted to give it a 10.0. It will make you laugh and make you cry. It will make you assess yourself and life. It raises lots of questions without trying to force too many answers. Sometimes life throws you a curve ball. You can miss it, duck it, hit it back or get hit and take a dive. The best bet is to stay in the batters box for the next pitch. You might strike outor you might get a walk. This film has nothing to do with baseball. I just like baseball metaphors for life.<br/><br/>Good-time buddies Adam (Gordon-Levitt) and Kyle (Rogan) are bouncing along in life. Adam looking for love and Kyle looking just to get laid. Opposites attract even with guys. Then, the seemingly ""good one"", Adam, gets diagnosed with cancer. Bad things happen to good people after all. But in his own bizarre way, Kyle sticks by his buddy in thick hair and thin. Adam's new girlfriend (Bryce Dallas-Howard) bales on him. Adam's Mom (Huston) reacts like a real loving mom would. Adam's Dad is so far down the road with Alzheimers, he has no clue. It is just as well. There are so many messages here it is hard to sort them all out. The fact is when a sudden death of a young person or cancer strikes, there is no solid playbook to follow. No one really knows what they will do, even when it happens. Even good people can fail the test. Just stand in the receiving line at any funeral of a young person. It's awkward and messy. People fumble when handed the ball (sorry, another sports metaphor). Just being there and taking the pain along side your friend or loved one is all that you are expected to dobut do it.<br/><br/>The 24 year old newbie therapist, Katherine (assigned to help Adam cope) is trying so hard. She knows what she has been taught and tries all the cliché tricks, but she realizes she must learn from her patient what she needs to know. In a sense, Katherine represents all of us. We all need to care and love, but also need to listen and learn from those who meet with challenge or tragedy. Often doctors, friends and family end up getting aid and comfort from the victim. Adam supplies the stability to everyone, even though it is he who has the cancer. TMG refuses to tell you more. This movie needs to unwind and reveal itself to you. I assure you, you will learn, laugh, cry and enjoy the experience. Take someone you care about and hug them when it is over. Let them know you are with them, in good times and in bad, for richer for poorer and in sickness and in health. You don't need to be married to give that support to another human being.<br/><br/>My co-host Joy Lynn says: As I noted on my Facebook page, if you plan to see 50/50, take a few tissues. If you are a mom of a 26 year old son, take the entire Kleenex box. The overall theme in this film is very similar to The Way! You cannot, and perhaps more importantly, should not, live life alone. You need a ""community"" of people to help carry your burdens. In this case, a dog (almost a person!), a therapist, a parent, and a best friend fill the bill. The saddest part of this movie for me was that fact that Adam began his struggle very much alone. The writer did an excellent job portraying the loneliness theme in this film by not having Adam drive, no true girlfriend, only one parent available emotionally, a ""retired"" greyhound dog, and only one friend Kyle (who was yet to prove his worth). No one can feel your pain—but each can help you carry the burden little by little. They may fumble trying, but each can offer something if they are willing to try. Thankfully, the story added some humor — not too much so to be disrespectful, but just enough to take the edge off. This is a very real movie – my favorite kind!! A few loopholes here and there made for a slow start, but once the chemo started, the movie began a new path."

","I thought this movie was pretty good; I laughed, I (didn't cry, but thought about crying), for the most part it handled its topic realistically and maturely.<br/><br/>BUT there were three things I didn't like in this film:<br/><br/>1. The main character's dad having Alzheimer's. Great idea, and an opportunity for comparing and contrasting ailments, but it's totally undeveloped in the story and leads nowhere and is just distracting.<br/><br/>2. The girlfriend. She's first handled realistically, then out of nowhere becomes a huge jerk. It's okay that she's a jerk, and it's okay that she doesn't want to go to treatments with the main character: she's only human. But then she goes from a round to flat character and the butt of jokes. She wasn't given any room to develop: she became something to move the plot along, and nothing more.<br/><br/>3. The ending. No, I'm not going to complain there's a happy ending: I'm very glad there's a happy ending, that's fine. But tagging on a ""love story"" makes the whole cancer seem like a quest-narrative, a journey that our hero must triumph over to reach his one-true-love. In essence, it's equating cancer as a ""character building"" experience, and the hero has won his prize in a girl.<br/><br/>That's a little simplifying. I've never had cancer but people in my family have and some have died and from what I can see cancer sucks. It ruins your life and everybody around you, it's slow, it's painful, it's a horrible way to die. It's not something you laugh off. It changes you. It's not something you go through and then at the end you wipe your brow and say ""Whew! Glad that's over!"" You worry it will come back. You've been through this painful experience that wasn't caused by anything you did, that you didn't ask for. It just happened to you, and it changes you.<br/><br/>I'm not saying I'm not glad the main character is happy and alive at the end, I'm just saying it's a little Hollywood magic that he ends up with his shrink (the only person that truly understands him?) after going through this traumatic event. It equates being in a relationship as the prize won for ""winning"" the game of cancer. There's no winners of cancer, only survivors. Validating cancer as an enriching experience and manufacturing a reward for winning it is what makes this otherwise vibrant movie both stale and oddly preachy."

","Cancer has always been a serious subject, and when used in films it is always tearjerking and realistic, Terms of Endearment for example, so you would never think that they could make a comedy film where it is the main plot, but then this came along. Basically twenty seven year old public radio journalist Adam Lerner (Golden Globe nominated Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is just your normal average guy with artist girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) and co-worker best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen). His life dramatically changes however when he goes to the doctor suffering with strange aches and pains, and he is diagnosed with a very rare form of spinal cancer, meaning that he will undergo chemotherapy, and looking the disease up on the internet it looks like he has a 50/50 chance of survival. Adam tells Kyle who sticks very close with him for support and to give him positivity about his condition, and when he tells his overbearing mother Diane (Anjelica Huston), who cares for his father Richard (Serge Houde) who is suffering Alzheimer's disease, she is very concerned. He does accept his mother's offer to stay at their house to be cared for, and Rachael, despite being uncomfortable going with him to hospital, says that she will help take care of him, that is until Kyle sees her kissing another man and reveals this to Adam. After the break up Kyle keeps his spirits up, and he says that Adam should try and use his disease for his own benefit, such as picking up women who will feel sympathetic, so with a shaved head, prior to chemotherapy, they try this theory out. Seeking more positivity and advice Adam starts seeing young and inexperienced therapist Katherine McKay (Up in the Air's Anna Kendrick), they start a rocky relationship of sessions, but he opens up to her about many things and they start to see each other outside of sessions as friends, and he also becomes friends with fellow chemotherapy patients Alan (Philip Baker Hall) and Mitch (Matt Frewer). Mitch dies and fears are obviously welling up inside of Adam, especially after he discovers the therapy is not working and a risky surgery is the last resort, and the night before he has a bad argument with a drunken Kyle, and he calls Katherine to get some much needed support. The next day Kyle and he make amends and go to the hospital, and after the six hour operation to remove the tumour the doctors tell Kyle, Diane, Katherine and Richard that the bone degradation was worse than first thought, but the surgery was successful and they hear Adam will recover. The film ends happily with Adam recovering very well, with Kyle rubbing cream onto the huge scar on his back, and he is getting ready for a date with Katherine, and together they smile wondering what the future will hold. Also starring Andrew Airlie as Dr. Ross. Gordon-Levitt gives a good vulnerable and touching performance as the victim to the fateful disease, Rogen gives his usual great brash and sometimes foul-mouthed performance as his best friend, together they are a good double act, and other cast members Howard, Kendrick and Houston also do well being concerned and supportive, the story does not make any jokes about what is happening to the character, but it does leave room for social and dialogue humour, so it all adds up to an interesting comedy drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Good!"

"Rockwell_Cronenberg","5","16","29","23 November 2011"," Living with cancer.
","When it comes to high-emotion situations in real life, few are more extreme than a diagnosis of cancer. Add in the fact that when Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Adam Lerner is only 27 years old when he gets the news and you already have a story primed for melodrama and loaded with tears and cheers. First-time writer Will Reiser uses his own experience with cancer at a young age to play down the dramatic aspects of illness, and instead showcase the lighter side of things, showing that even when you have cancer you still want to get laid and stoned with your best friend. It's not a strict comedy by any means, there are quite a few moments that got me a little choked up, but Reiser clearly set out with a goal to show things a little lighter than cancer is usually treated in the film. For the most part this works and, although at times I felt it was a little too light, I enjoyed Reiser's more authentic portrayal of a diagnosis like this.<br/><br/>The film sets out to be an unconventional cancer movie, and it achieves at that but it's still so much a cancer movie that there isn't any room for anything else. Yes, getting a severe diagnosis like this still leaves room in your life for comedic moments, but it also doesn't control every second of your life. It felt like every frame of this movie was about cancer, and there wasn't any room for just...life. When Adam's best friend is a jerk it's about cancer, when his mom is too worried it's about cancer, when his girlfriend does something awful it's about cancer. Adam learns his diagnosis early on in the film and we're not given enough time to understand the character before this, so the whole thing ends up revolving around the cancer. The whole thing would have benefited so much by getting us to have a stake in him before he gets the news, but instead Reiser builds the entire movie around cancer; which it should be, but not to this extreme.<br/><br/>Reiser focuses everything on the cancer, and as a result there's a lot of stuff that gets left behind, namely the supporting characters. In approaching Adam, they take on the guy full force, helped by a great performance from Gordon-Levitt. I was a huge fan of Gordon-Levitt in the mid-2000s when he had this incredible streak of solid performances, but then he kind of faded for me and I was worried that I wasn't going to be impressed by him again. Thankfully I found this to be a return to form for him, taking on a character who shuts himself off and meets people's desire to help with aggression but quickly making him likable and easy to root for. As I said earlier, I wish we had met Adam earlier so I could have had more of a stake in him, but Levitt makes up for it with a very sympathetic performance that taps into the root of what it's like to have something like this take you over so young.<br/><br/>It's when we get to the rest of the characters that I think Reiser slips up. For the most part, all of the supporting characters are so thin that it's hard to really appreciate any of them as real people. Reiser works so hard on making the cancer aspect feel more genuine and unique that he doesn't spend enough time with the characters to make them feel as such. They all just feel like these movie types we've already seen instead of real people, the most offensive of which being Adam's therapist played by Anna Kendrick. Buying Kendrick as a therapist is hard enough to get over, but the way that they treat this relationship is honestly one of the most offensive and ridiculous things I've seen all year. From the second they meet it's such a Hollywood display of incorrect cutesiness in a film that, for the most part, was dealing with things in a pretty realistic way that it was honestly jaw-dropping to this absurd relationship develop. Kendrick and Levitt try their best to make up for it, they do have a very sweet chemistry between them, but for me there was no getting around how absolutely ridiculous this whole relationship was. It dragged the film down a lot for me.<br/><br/>For a while the title of the film was going to be Living With Cancer, and I feel like that would have been a more accurate name for it. Reiser should be admired for his approach to dealing with cancer, especially at such a young age, but I wish he had spent a lot more time on the actual living side of things. There are a lot of genuine emotions going on here and I appreciate Reiser and director Jonathan Levine not going the easy route with melodrama and emotional manipulation that you find in most stories dealing with this topic, but the film has quite a few contrivances that betray the characters in order to benefit story progression and the therapist relationship is something that left a bad taste in my mouth all the way through. There's still a lot to be admired though, so at the end I've come down pretty much in the middle when it comes to the overall product."
"chang-skeee","3","38","79","24 November 2012"," The most overrated movie I've ever seen
","93% on Rotten Tomatoes? Seriously? <br/><br/>Look, I'm not a cynic. I love lame, weepy dramedies. Even those with little depth can be thoroughly touching and entertaining. But what I can't roll with is sh**ty writing and story- telling. Why do I say that, you ask? A few big reasons:<br/><br/>1) See, usually when a movie features a character story, that character must undergo some sort of fundamental change. He or she may learn something from a trial or a difficult experience and come out stronger on the other end. For example, the character might find out that he has cancer and appreciate life more because he's come to terms with his own mortality. <br/><br/>There is absolutely no character arc in this movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt's character Adam DOESN'T CHANGE AT ALL THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE. He starts off as a banal character who just kind of goes through life (who doesn't even have any notable character traits in the first place). He finds out he has cancer, and by the end of the movie...he is still a banal character who just kind of goes through life. Ask yourself this question; what exactly did Adam learn throughout the movie? What kind of wisdom did having cancer impart in him. How exactly was his life different from before his cancer to after? The answer is, NOTHING. <br/><br/>For one thing, I find this a little insulting to cancer victims because, in my opinion, it trivializes the trauma of having cancer. My grandpa has cancer right now. You think his life is different because of it? It sure as hell is. For another thing, this is just poor, crappy storytelling.<br/><br/>2) I have a friend, a PHILOSOPHY MAJOR IN COLLEGE who told me to pay attention to Seth Rogen's character Kyle, because he's ""interesting"". No he's not. He's not interesting. You know how he came across as a jerk the whole time who took advantage of his friend's horrible situation and didn't seem to care the whole time? And you know how at the end, they show the book on his table or whatever? This isn't depth. It's a CONTRADICTION. It's bad writing. It doesn't make Kyle a deep character at all. It makes Kyle a horribly conceived character who doesn't make any sense. I realize there's a forum thread about this movie on IMDb about whether or not Kyle is a good friend. The answer is: there is no answer. Why? Because the writer of the movie didn't care enough to write a good answer into the script. <br/><br/>Addendum to 2- the characterizations of every supporting character in this movie sucked. Bryce Dallas Howard's character of ""the bad girlfriend"" is just too simple. I don't like movies where the bad guy is just evil and nothing else. It's too easy that way. It's lazy. Everyone else just basically had one character gimmick. Anna Kendrick- naive. Oh, and messy, don't forget messy. Anjelica Houston- overbearing. Old dying people- cynical. <br/><br/>3) I just get this weird feeling that everybody loves that scene in the car where Joseph Gordon- Levitt cries. It's really emotional, I guess. And I understand that this was a moment of catharsis for the character and maybe the acting was pretty good here. But one single scene out of context doesn't make a movie good. <br/><br/>4) There are a lot of ""Juno"" moments in this movie. You know what I mean. The kind where they do some random shots of scenery, maybe play some indie music you've never heard of. This is usually done to create some air of deep contemplation. It's a f**king farce. It's a trick to make you think the movie's smarter than it is. Don't be fooled. <br/><br/>Now, I'll be fair. Here are things I liked:<br/><br/>1) Acting- not bad. I find JGL really overrated, and I feel like every single movie he's been in gets way too much credit. But he wasn't bad in this or anything. I happen to like Anna Kendrick. Seth Rogen is okay as well because his job was to be Seth Rogen. <br/><br/>2) Ummm actually that's it. Well, I like criticizing this movie. Maybe that counts. <br/><br/>No one wants to insult the cancer movie. I certainly don't. But just because I hate the movie doesn't mean I'm unsympathetic to cancer victims. A lot of filmmakers get away with creating pure crap just because of the subject matter. Don't let this sway your opinion. A crap movie is a crap movie. <br/><br/>There are a lot of movies like this that, in my opinion, are given way too much credit. By no means am I a film snob, but I think people need to check out more established directors. That way, they'll have higher standards than faux-intellectual, weepy bulls**t like this."

","This heart-wrenching laugh-out-loud comedy will take you through a mixture of emotions; you will be laughing your head off with it's perfectly placed humour and falling into deep self-reflection on the importance of life and well-being which we all so carelessly take for granted. This poignant story is about a 27-year old healthy, reserved, safe character Adam (Joseph Gordon Levitt) who is suddenly diagnosed with a rare and malignant type of cancer and is given a 50/50 chance of beating it. The story develops the unique relationships between the malingerer and his friends and family and how everyone handles the stress and grief differently. <br/><br/>The screenplay really deserves credit; it deals with the traumatic illness of cancer in an honest way, without ever feeling fake; and the acting really compliments that, Joseph Gordon Levitt gives a truly believable and excellent performance of a young man facing this trouble; and the best friend (Seth Rogan) portrays his characters sentimental big heart underneath his awkwardly funny and sexually-driven personality perfectly. The scenes between the trainee psychiatrist (Anna Kendrick) and Adam are a pleasure because of her obvious instant attraction conflicted by her obligation to stay within the boundaries of patient conduct and give her best professional objective help.<br/><br/>The story is primarily a comedy but its subtleties and underlying themes are truly excellent and what makes it thoroughly pleasant to watch and a touching experience. The importance of the comedy value throughout the film is essential for balance; and to remind the audience that a smile and a laugh between friends and family can always help ease the brutal and grave reality of life."

No one in their right mind would give this thing more than a 6, 6.5 at the very absolute most.<br/><br/>So, yeah."

","'50/50' is a film that I really wanted to like but ultimately it was a complete bore and I struggled to watch it all. <br/><br/>Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen, I had high hopes as I really like both the actors. I have nothing bad to say about their performances but throughout the film you just don't feel any emotional attachment to JGL and SR is kinda just there for cheap laughs (not really laugh out loud moments, just some things that'll make you smile). <br/><br/>The plot is a delicate subject but doesn't really draw you in. There just isn't anything happening and I found myself looking at the clock (sign of a boring film). I certainly wouldn't class this as a comedy, it is just a drama that fails to deliver what it could have done. <br/><br/>Overall I was disappointed and wouldn't recommend this film. Shame because I like the actors and the potential was there. <br/><br/>4/10."

","I feel a bit guilty being a dissenting voice on 50/50, as it tackles such a serious subject matter, and a has a very likable lead character. But in the end, there just wasn't much substance to this piece, until the final few minutes, for me to really invest in it.<br/><br/>Most of the material in the script is dealt with the slack, off-handed ""Dude, remember the time you got cancer? Yeah, sucked, huh?"" type of way.<br/><br/>The film works so hard to not be serious or over-dramatic, that it winds up with almost no drama at all. When a serious moment does arise for the character, a pop tune is inserted into the soundtrack, to make sure we as the audience don't have to sit with the pain and confusion that the character is feeling. We can simply zone out for a bit, while we sway to the music.<br/><br/>Now, I certainly wasn't expecting ""Terms of Endearment"", or a super-serious drama, but I also wasn't expecting the topic to be handled in such an incredibly frivolous, predictable, and frankly, sometimes boring manner.<br/><br/>The film doesn't quite work as a drama, and even though there is a few genuinely funny moments, they are certainly not enough to sustain it as a comedy. The plot itself is fairly cliché and predictable. You'd have to have never watched a film before not to know just about every development that will come to pass; other than the eventual health outcome of the Levitt's character. But frankly, even that was tipped off to anyone who saw the weeks of promotion in the run-up to the film where Seth Rogan speaks about the film being based on a true story. <br/><br/>What basically saves the film in the end is Joseph Gordon Levitt's likability factor, and a very strong performance by his mother, Angelica Houston, who unfortunately, didn't get more screen time. Had the film focused on that, it may have been stronger. Seth Rogan's character seems only to serve as a device for comic relief, to make sure we don't get too down.<br/><br/>The last part of the film ends strong and hits all the emotional buttons (it would've made a great short), but the majority of the film is basically another arrested development story, with Rogan's character acting like the affable, 12-year old boy, providing his fair share of penis and weed jokes, that we've grown to love...or at least tolerate. This was surprising, after I'd heard so much talk about how different this character was from all his others. <br/><br/>I'm sure it was very difficult, especially in today's filmmaking environment, to get a film about cancer made. This is likely why the director and writers tried to lighten it up whenever possible. But one can only dilute a potent cocktail so much before it simply gets too watered down to drink.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I will likely remember very little about this film, except for the end, which was handled quite well. For me, it just wasn't enough to make up for the insignificance of the first hour and twenty minutes."

","Based on the personal experiences of screenwriter Will Reiser, ""50/50"" is an honest blend of intense, heartfelt emotion and dark, irreverent humor. It's a rare and mesmerizing film that will have you laughing one minute and crying the next. Viewers will be profoundly moved by this inspirational tale of a man coming to the grips with his morality but chooses to embrace life instead and discovers passion, friendship, love and humanity during the process. <br/><br/>I've always admired Joseph Gordon Levitt (Third Rock from the Sun, Inception) as an actor, and he deserves an Oscar for his performance as Adam: a man who suddenly discovers that he's diagnosed with a spinal tumor. The film benefits from Levitt's lukewarm tenderness, appealing charisma, and unmatched vulnerability in order for the storyline to be credible. <br/><br/>Teen sensation Seth Rogen (Knocked Up, Pineapple Express) on the other hand is crude and vulgar as usual playing Adam's best friend. But he displays a sense of sympathy, affection and earnestness while playing the average-everyday slacker character for a change and manages to deliver a sensational and fulfilling performance. The meat and potatoes of this precious gem lies beneath Levitt and Rogen's irresistible and undeniable chemistry and their ability to establish a kinetic on-screen bromance. Being able to accomplish that shows how much potential these talented individuals have. <br/><br/>The sharp and brainy script will have you bursting out with laughter and tears, and the influential messages about finding humor beneath pain, valuing the purposes of life and living everyday like it's your last will bring out joy to even the most careless people alive. The important life-lessons will challenge audiences-alike to go back and rethink their lives. <br/><br/>A few scenes should have been left in the editing room, but it's still a genuine work of art and extreme geniusness that stands out as one of the more thoughtful films in recent years. Even though I'm yet to be diagnosed with cancer, ""50/50"" has come to mean a great deal to me and I urge anyone who isn't moved by the time the closing credits roll to check their pulse immediately."

","I do not understand why this movie was not released in my country. I think it is one of the most moving dramas I saw. This one is short and well-paced. It means it is very entertaining, as well as moving and shocking. It contains some humour, as well. I have not seen any more movies directed by Jonathan Levine, but he did an excellent job in this case. The cast is good, without many stars, but with actors portraying very believable roles and nice characters. Joseph Gordon Levitt, still very young as an actor, has an excellent career. He does very believable jobs. You should see him in movies like ""Batman: the dark knight rises"", ""Ten reasons to hate you"", ""Looper"", ""The lookout"" and ""500 days of summer"". He is good at many different genres and roles. He is the protagonist and does an excellent job portraying the part of a young man who suffers from a very serious cancer. Seth Rogen, a specialist in comedies, delivered his best performance in the movie. I did not like him much before. He is the main character's best friend and adds a comedy tone. The actresses Anna Kendrick, Bryce Dallas Howard and specially, Anjelica Huston, are very good in their female-roles. The whole cast is excellent. The best thing about the movie is its capacity of making us believe what it tells. It actually made me feel in the characters' foots. I almost cried at the end. There are some disgusting and necessary scenes. It is curious that it adds some humour in the scenes (I guess some patients like this tell jokes in order to take it easier as a therapy). The movie makes you value your health even more. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good movies, specially dramas... 8."

","50/50 is probably the only movie I have ever seen that took a very serious topic such as cancer and turned it into a comedy or I should say dramedy. It works because there is a nice balance between laugh-out-loud comedy and very sad, serious moments. I laughed incredibly hard in some scenes and even shed a few tears in others. I liked the tone of the film because it has that off-beat, quirky, non-mainstream feeling to it.<br/><br/>Jonathan Levine's film is about a 27-year-old guy who is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. Because of his disease, he truly finds out what kind of person he is thanks to all of his family and friends supporting him such as his wise-cracking friend, over-concerned mother, and his shy, quirky therapist.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt certainly has his acting chops on hand. He proves he can still star in indie films such as this after appearing in big blockbusters like he did with Inception. He brought a certain charm to his role. I was surprised to see Seth Rogen in a movie like this. This is probably his best role he played to date. Anjelica Huston goes over-the-top as the freaked-out mother. Anna Kendrick is just the right person to play the therapist with her quirky personality.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good film that brings out the lighter side of the disease. It has a central theme that suggests people to be optimistic in times of disease and peril. I'm glad they didn't make a very serious movie or I'll be shedding tears nonstop. Jonathan Levine has a great career ahead of him after this movie. I rate this film 9/10."

","50/50 is a drama. And a comedy. And one of the better films to come down the pike in 2011.<br/><br/>Because of the very nature of its story, it should be no surprise that the movie is emotionally draining. What might be surprising, though, is that it's uplifting in equal measure. Rather than wallowing in the wake of its protagonist's recent cancer diagnosis, it takes the route of allowing its audience a glimpse into the life of a man who's struggling to overcome more than just the disease that serves as the proverbial MacGuffin. At times, the movie is guilty of conforming to indie/rom-com clichés that have defined the genre for the past five (or so) years, but the leads are so likable—and the writing is so crisp, poignant, and utterly hilarious—that it's hard to point to such tendencies as a fault.<br/><br/>As usual, Rogen and company are able to bottle the ""real life"" conversation and observations that assign a tangible identity to the neo-nerd pop culture that is the twenty-something male of contemporary society. Because of this, what could have easily been a draining slog through the life of a disgruntled cancer patient becomes a celebration of latching onto anything (and everything) that has substance. The evolution of Adam (Levitt) is realistic and touching, and by the time the inevitable ""confrontation"" takes place, you'll feel like you've endured something miraculous.<br/><br/>To further comment on the layered plot and what it implies about the needs of everyone ""surviving"" all walks of life would be to ruin some of the more unexpected revelations that come from 50/50, so I'll end by saying, quite simply, that it's a wonderful movie.<br/><br/>In fact, there's a 99.9% chance that you'll leave the theater with a huge smile on your face. And I'm willing to bet not too many people saw that coming."

","Adam (Levitt) is a normal 27 year old whose life is one day turned upside-down and inside-out when an appointment to see the doctor about a recurring back problem is diagnosed as a rare form of cancer, the survival rate of which, he soon discovers from the internet, is from where the movie gets its title. Adam's post-diagnosis life is full of trials which his artist girlfriend Rachel (Dallas Howard) is unable to deal with and which his wise-cracking, skirt-chasing best friend Kyle (Rogen) sees as the perfect ploy to get girls into bed. To make things worse, his mother (pitch perfectly played by Housten) wants to smother him the way she has all her life and the psychiatrist he is sent to see is a touchy-feely trainee whose every reassuring gesture is taken straight from a textbook. From the beginning the film employs humour deftly with a mine of witty, laugh-out-loud, exchanges (mostly between Levitt and Rogen) which, as Adam's condition develops, walks a fine line between levity and rawness which in a lesser film would come across as distasteful. Similarly, as we see the true depth of Kyle's friendship, and the rookie psychiatrist begins to see the person behind the case study (nudge-nudge) the story nimbly avoids the potential for cliché and superficial Hollywood smaltz and, finished off with a cool indie soundtrack, comes off as an honest and emotionally rewarding treat."

","I was reading the latest edition of Entertainment Weekly where they announce the Entertainers of the Year 2012. I glanced through the pages to find Ben Affleck, the cast of Homeland including Claire Danes and Damian Lewis, Jennifer Lawrence, Channing Tatum, Anne Hathaway until I came across Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He's a peculiar kind of actor that came out of nowhere until I noticed him in movies like Inception and Dark Knight Rises where he's gotten momentum and noticeability, luckily not the wrong kind of publicity that we've come to expect from other young actors (see Lindsay Lohan) but a good recognition for their good work instead of their personal lives.<br/><br/>I read the article expecting to see his work on 50/50 which came out in 2011 but they only focused on The Dark Knight Rises and Looper (with Bruce Willis). Then I realized the title: Entertainers of the Year 2012. I prefer him in smaller films like 50/50 and 500 Days of Summer where his performance shines through. In 50/50, he plays a young man who discovers that he's got a rare life-threatening tumor and has a, you guessed it, 50/50 chance of surviving it. What I like most about the story is that, instead of being melodramatic and depressing, it turns out to be rather uplifting and, dare I say, funny. Based on the true story by Will Reiser, the film sees Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) dealing with his cancer treatment on his own. His father suffers from Alzeihmer's and his mother (played by the always wonderful Anjelica Houston) is so overbearing and protective of him that he chooses to deal with his battle with cancer alone with little to no help from his detached girlfriend Rachael (played by Bryce Dallas Howard). His best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) tries his darnest to be very supportive of him but he doesn't realize that his friend is slowly but surely slipping away and he doesn't know how to cheer him up. His therapist (Anna Kendrick) is not very experienced on the matter either (she only has 2 other patients under her belt) thus Adam becomes very defensive and brutally honest with her: he's sick and tired of everyone telling him that whatever he's feeling is ""normal"" , his attitude and mood swings ""understandable"" under his condition. He's tired of everybody being so ""nice"" when they learn about his condition yet nobody is really honest and upfront with him (except for Kyle who seems rather oblivious to the fact that his best friend has cancer). He wants somebody to have the guts to tell him that he may not be okay, that there's a chance that he may not make it and help him cope with that fact. I am glad that these movies gets made and they don't always have a Hollywood ending. I especially like the raw performance from Joseph Gordon Levitt that is deserving of an award or just recognition. He really holds the movie together by inviting us to look at how fragile one's life really is. There's a particular moment when we see Adam going for the eminent surgery that may either cure him or kill him quicker and, for a brief moment, he loses faith and needs somebody there for him. Luckily his mother is there and the moment is so brief yet so powerful that sends chills down my spine. I literally saw the fear in his eyes at the uncertainty that lay ahead of him. It's one of those moments that don't make it to the script but are worth 1,000 words."

"Turfseer","3","17","40","25 January 2012"," No laughs in 'feel good' cancer movie, made worse by thoroughly obnoxious Seth Rogen performance
","50/50 is by Will Reiser, who by his own admission had writer's block until he was stricken with a rare form of spinal cancer. He thought it would be an original idea if he wrote a 'comedy' about a topic he was familiar with. As it turned out, 50/50 (which refers to the protagonist's chances of survival), plays more like a 'dramedy', than a narrative written strictly for laughs.<br/><br/>At the outset, a story such as this is going to have difficulties, due to the apparent lack of a strong antagonist. Obviously, Reiser's stand-in for himself, Adam Lerner (played endearingly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) does have that internal arc, where we're curious as to see how he copes with his illness. The external story arc, whether Adam survives the cancer or not, seems to be a foregone conclusion, since not only are many people aware that Reiser survived the cancer (after all he was well enough to write the screenplay) but the whole idea of killing the protagonist off, might have been a little too much for most film goers to take.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the writing takes a decisive wrong turn when Reiser opts to make Adam's girlfriend, Rachael, the 'bad guy'. It's not like Rachael's been married to Adam for years and then decides to abandon him, by having an affair. No, it's quite understandable that a young woman would feel resentful about being placed in the role of a 'caregiver' instead of a 'girlfriend', at such a tender age. What is her great crime? She decides to have that affair and fails to tell Adam about it. And the reason why she fails to tell Adam she's cheating on him is because just as much as she wants out, she also feels extremely guilty about what she's doing and would really like to still help Adam, but can do nothing, as he begins wasting away from the side effects of chemotherapy.<br/><br/>Along comes the obnoxious Seth Rogen, who plays Adam's vile buddy, Kyle. Rogen as Kyle, in his holier than thou attitude, throws Rachael under the bus, painting her as a despicable villain, merely because she's acting like most people would in her situation (note that squeaky clean therapist, Katherine, played by Anne Kendrick, only has to see Adam in her office and isn't privy to the extent of Adam's deterioration, as Rachael is). Note that Adam was very kind with Rachael at first, when he tells her that he would understand if she left him. But due to Kyle's unwholesome, negative influence, Kyle cajoles Adam into destroying Rachael's oil painting. What an ugly scene!<br/><br/>I understand that it's sometimes important to try and use humor to try and soften an overwhelmingly depressing situation (as in the case of a diagnosis of cancer). But what is so humorous about a 'buddy' such as Kyle, always encouraging his stricken friend, to continue to attempt that one next sexual conquest followed by another. Is this his way of making Adam feel more 'normal'? I hardly believe that Adam needs that kind of encouragement. It will only lead to bad feelings amongst all parties involved! <br/><br/>I was reading one cancer survivor's review of 50/50 and he felt the film minimized what it was like to cope with cancer. The poster writes in substance: ""Chemo is an incredibly powerful drug...the longer you're on it, the more cells it continues to destroy, and it basically slowly kills you. I saw the character sick after his first infusion, and then doing quite well throughout the rest of his illness...The opposite is true; you get worse, not more functional, and weaker. Your sex drive plummets...appetite, your sense of taste and smell. None of that was portrayed."" The poster did concede there was a scene where Adam was unsuccessful at sex, after experiencing exhaustion, but on the whole, I do believe he's right. While the film does imply Adam is ""cured' after his surgery, many times the illness comes back in a more virulent form a few years down the road. That's after all the intrusive and debilitating surgery as well as the side effects from chemotherapy.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most realistic and true moment in 50/50 is when Adam breaks down inside the car and proclaims, ""I'm tired of it all"". The story devolves into an unlikely and quite sentimental romance between Adam and his therapist, who unethically gets involved with him at film's end. Angelica Huston tries for laughs at the beginning, playing an apparent, overbearing Jewish mother. Later, there are a few better heartfelt exchanges between mother and son.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest disservice of a film such as 50/50 is how it fails to question the cancer establishment's unbridled faith in treatments such as chemotherapy. The gullibility of a character like Adam is the norm in our society. Instead of exploring alternative options, he fails to ask any questions of his oncologist, and blindly accepts his pronouncements. As it turns out, the practitioner is typical of many physicians today, who doesn't expect you to challenge him, and acts as if he has all the answers. As is usually the case, the chemo treatments turn out to be worse than the disease itself, killing the bad cells as well as the good, and destroying the quality of the patient's life.<br/><br/>I found most of 50/50 to be a very unpleasant experience, because it implies there is only one way to treat cancer (chemo, radiation and surgery). While Gordon-Levitt does his best in a difficult part, Seth Rogen has proved to have worn out his welcome as a serious actor and should be relegated to roles on bad TV sitcoms—where hopefully he will disappear from the entertainment scene, sooner than later!"

","I looked forward to 50/50. I enjoy JGL's acting and thought I'd get a kick out of seeing him play a young guy who learns he has a very serious form of cancer that might take his life. One reviewer suggested that the film would remind you how every day is a gift. Being unemployed with bills, I needed that kind of reminder.<br/><br/>I'm still depressed. I didn't think this movie was funny, insightful, touching, or distinctive. A young guy finds out he might die from cancer, his shallow girlfriend can't hang, but his buddy does and keeps his outlook positive by encouraging him to use his cancer to get laid. In most films, I can get lost in the story and film as a whole world. In 50/50, however, I always got the sense that these were actors running scenes and they were all strung together to voila! Make a movie. The relationships between characters were for the most part cliché--the annoying mother, the shallow girlfriend, the inhuman doctor, the loyal buddy. And, if I were facing death, I would probably request an experienced doctor and not allow to be a guinea pig for a 24-year-old trainee. <br/><br/>But I gave this film 6 out of 10 because the last 20 minutes were indeed quite heartfelt.

","Just saw an early screening of this movie tonight, and although I typically enjoy a dark comedy I wasn't sure if this movie was going to have enough funny. I thought it might be the kind of movie where all of the funny parts were already in the commercials and at the theater you're left with depressing. To my delight, this movie was really great. It truly covered every emotion imaginable. If you think ""oh, I don't want to see a movie about cancer"" forget it, it's worth it. Equal parts depressing and comedic.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen's role as the supportive women hungry best friend is perfect. Also, Angelica Huston's performance as Adam's smothering mother was perfect- you know that's exactly how you feel your mother is like sometimes. Joseph Gordon-Levitt acting as Adam was incredibly passionate and I felt like I was going through every emotion with him.<br/><br/>It is a movie worth seeing in theaters. I don't want to have to wait until the DVD comes out to see it again, I don't even want to wait till it is released in theaters, but I guess I don't have a choice so when it comes out in theaters I will be seeing it again."

","They did the impossible. They made me laugh hysterically during a cancer film. The performances are fantastic, especially Gordon-Levitt and Kendrick. If there is any justice, these two will become massive stars with this film. Huston was also marvelous. Seth Rogen played the same character he always has but I didn't mind because his character is a crucial part to what makes this movie work so well. <br/><br/>Everyone gives a honest performance and the situations are genuine. There are some great laughs but there are also some heartbreaking moments. This definitely a movie for our time, and being a twenty-something myself, I connected with any aspects of this film, especially the relationship between Gordon-Levitt and Rogen's characters. <br/><br/>This has been a great year for R-rated comedies and I believe this film is head and shoulders above the rest.

","Cancer movies have been done and overdone, but there's always the chance that someone will do something new and different. Here, there are several new and different angles. The super acting job by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who manages to show many sides of a particular human reacting to a particular human problem, helps take this story up several notches from the usual tearjerker. Most of the characters (cancer victim, best friend, girlfriend, novice therapist, parents) are given three-dimensional lives. Standing out, aside from Gordon-Levitt, are Angelica Huston as the Mom and Philip Baker Hall as the chemo infusion-buddy. The script, which I believe is based on a true story (that of the screenwriter's own experience), and the direction by Jonathan Levine, keeps us interested, sympathetic, and laughing, even if it also allows us to share in varieties of suffering . It's not just the disease that's a problem here; it's also the nature of the relationships between people who are close, love each other and are challenged to connect in a positive way. I only wish that Seth Rogan had more to do (or, could do more with it) than the one-note, stereotypic role he has in this film. He's the same guy in all his movies. What if it were HIS character with the cancer? Now that could be an interesting sequel."
"avenuesf","5","8","18","24 November 2011"," Great performances, pretty poor script
","As a cancer survivor who who went through chemo and radiation for lung malignancy four years ago, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. In addition, I think Joseph Gordon Leavitt is an awesome actor. There are some great performances in this film, as well as one or two very realistic scenes (the isolation/alienation, the very real moment where he loses it in the car and finally proclaims he's 'tired of of it all'), but that's about all I could identify with. Chemo is an incredibly powerful (and, as Melissa Ethridge puts it ""barbaric"") drug. The longer you're on it, the more cells it continues to destroy, and it basically slowly kills you. I saw the character sick after his first infusion, and then doing quite well throughout the rest of his illness. The opposite is true; you get worse, not more functional, and weaker. Your sex drive plummets, despite the character's desire to find women to hook up with (although I admit, when he finally did, things didn't exactly succeed), as well as your appetite, your sense of taste and smell. None of that was portrayed. Lastly, the tumor that he had on his spine did not shrink from the chemo and continued to metastasize, which is a concerning response; despite his surgery being semi-successful at the end, there was no mention of the high possibility that because of its size it had a high chance of continuing to spread. The film gave the viewer the impression that because they were able to remove it, he was ""cured,"" which was definitely not necessarily the case. The other glaring inaccuracy in the film is a typical Hollywood one: the therapist begins a romantic relationship with his/her client. This is considered completely unethical and would result in the therapist losing her license as a result; so if this was based on a ""true story,"" it's definitely been embellished for the screen. Seth Rogen and Anjelica Huston were, as always, terrific. But I'd really like to see a Hollywood film made that portrays cancer as it really is. This is definitely not it."

","The story is great, as are the performances, music, times of laughter, and dramatic moments and themes. People tear up, and laugh, pay close attention to the film while relating to the characters. I do not doubt you should see this.<br/><br/>Now I want to say firstly that although I did enjoy this movie, I did not enjoy its poor filmmaking.<br/><br/>For all of you with a more strict sense of what GREAT film should involve read below.<br/><br/>Without an excessively cliché formula, seen and seen again, the director of the film may actually have had do innovate or be original. The director may have had to cut some of this numerous semi slow motion scenes of people walking and thinking while the soundtrack for the film takes precedence over time in which these two dimensional characters wait for the go ahead to reach the potential that the audience knows is present.<br/><br/>I want to like Adam, JGLs character, but then I think, the film just started I know something unfortunate may happen but he's just kind of a selfish, quiet, keeps to himself jerk. Wait, isn't he the ""hero"" though. Shouldn't the filmmakers portray something more relatable than his trendy wardrobe and quirky radio job? I like the best friend Kyle, Seth Rogan, but then again he's really just Seth Rogan, and I wonder if someone in production should have made the difficult choices of what dialogue would be most appropriate, or if they should just let Seth carry the 50% comedy aspect of the film on his own.<br/><br/>I mean was there a dramatic script and then they decided that the movie would make more money with a funny best friend, as opposed to a non frat pack member. Should we bring in Paul Rudd as the douche senior radio editor and make Steve Carell the stern and awkward funny doctor? Should we not do that? Oh well ""Action."" Hell guys, you've got the true accounts in the story, people already are rooting for you. Then, write a solid script and get a director who knows what he's doing. Make the tough choices that a ""dramady"" requires to balance, because you can't have it all. You've already got the cast. Lastly watch the film without these flashy clichés (music sequences, utter predictability) and tell me that these hip unsubtle accessories make a lasting movie.<br/><br/>The saving grace is the cast and their performances. The story itself seems striped of any character depth, supporting role or leading. This could have been a lasting film with depth, Oscar consideration, poignant social consciousness, appeal to the youth of America, help for Cancer awareness, inspiration for survivors and the diagnosed everywhere, and career catapults for the entire cast.<br/><br/>Instead it proved to be as immature, selfish, trendy, good looking and funny as the character of Adam. Above average film no more."

And while he is the 'strong' one in the movie, there are scenes that show him vulnerable and at his most weakest, that really get choking back the tears.<br/><br/>But there are also big laughs in this too, and sometimes those big laughs come as a sigh of relief, and of course they come courtesy of Rogen, who hasn't been this good in a very long time. The chemistry between the two leads is so strong, that you really believe that they have been friends for a long time.<br/><br/>The majority of the film is predictable, as is expected, but when a film has this much magnitude and impact, it doesn't really matter. There are the very sad parts, for example the character played by Matt Frewer is a small role, but leaves an effect on the whole picture, turning it into a more sombre affair there on in.<br/><br/>But despite its heavy subject matter and sombre feelings, there are some amazing punch in the air moments, the moments when certain characters get their dues and you think to your self 'thats exactly what I would have done'.<br/><br/>Extremely sad in places and hilariously funny on others, 50/50 ironically keeps a steady balance on the two and in turn makes this one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>You really have to see this."

","There are many movies we see that come and pass by like a wind near the ocean. But there are movies that don't leave an impact on you but introduce you to the way of life. The jagged mysteries of our lives which appear bad, disagreeable, horrible, nauseating and sickening on a normal day suddenly appear delectable, ethereal, delightful and diaphanous after being introduced to a master piece like this.<br/><br/>The world gives us the opportunities to get a life but we all choose to take the unprecedented path to show how unique and different we are. This remains true to people trying to lead a normal life as well (just like the guy in the movie did). But the truth lies in the fact that we all trying to make a difference (or looking for a different approach to a problem) is a sign of us being ordinary beings. We all die after all. <br/><br/>The work of the screenplay writer is just too good. Timing is the key to this motion picture. It surely brings watery chemical (highly malignant in the presence of someone and benign alone ;)) in the eyes of the viewer. Trust me on this one but i have got to say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the only man i know who could have done justice to this man who underwent the misery alone although he had all his dear ones behind him without his knowledge. I just wish that all the loved ones be not just behind an ailing man but also beside the person who need not necessarily have to go through so much for your Kind Attention.

","While watching ""50/50"", I had the strange experience of being an ""outsider looking in"" at the events transpiring on the screen. Having never battled cancer myself, I found it difficult to make any judgement on the actions.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie sees a young man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. As he struggles to cope with the diagnosis & treatment of his disease, he is ""helped along"" (in a variety of different ways) by a greenhorn therapist (Anna Kendrick), his smothering mother (Anjelica Huston), and his ""best bud"" (Seth Rogen).<br/><br/>There are times when this movie seems downright ridiculous and seems to veer from any coherent narrative. However, there are also moments that will bring tears to your eyes. It is a very strange flick in that sense.<br/><br/>The reason for the strange-ness? The crazy collection of characters present. Levitt himself proves me than capable of carrying the show, and his relationship with ""Kendrick"" provides probably the best moments in the film. But then there are the auxiliary cast, who you will alternately hate and appreciate in equal doses. I'm usually a fan of complex characters, but in ""50/50"" I would actually use the word ""uneven"" to describe them.<br/><br/>Thus, I have to give this film a middle-of-the-road rating for now (perhaps at some other point in my life I will appreciate it more/less). It's like those personality tests you take in college that ask you to rate something on a ""scale of 1-5"". When you aren't quite sure how you feel, you give it a three."

If you're expecting a typical Seth Rogan movie, it's not this one, he is really very good at portraying the best friend who at first doesn't have a clue how to help his friend deal with his situation.

Recently, more films have been mixing and bending genres. 50/50 delivers a strong mixture of comedy and drama, never verging on weepy Oscar-bait or immature comedy. It is a difficult task to find some comedy to counter balance Cancer, but writer Will Reiser draws appropriately from his own experiences of illness and with friend Seth Rogen, co-star and producer, to ensure that the story moves along organically and smoothly. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines as Adam, never letting the character have a dull moment. His chemistry with Seth Rogen and the other supporting characters (Anna Kendrick and Anjelica Huston, to name a few) builds on the strong screenplay. Be forewarned, the movie is probably not for everyone, (Seth Rogen even spoke once regarding some people being taken aback by the cancer theme present in a somewhat comedic form) it's definitely a winner. Too bad the major awards looked past this one (although it did receive two Golden Globe nominations)."

Joseph Gordon Levitt start as a 27 year old man who gets diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and is given a 50/50 shot of staying alive. Seth Rogan is his best friend and he is hilarious as always. Levitt goes to a treatment center and meets two older cancer patients and they are also very funny, but other than that this movie was straight up drama. <br/><br/>Is 50/50 a good movie? Eh, yes, it has a lot of emotion and Joseph Gordon Levitt makes the character very believable. Cancer is a very hard thing to live with affecting so many people. He has a girlfriend and she eventually shows her true colors. A lot of the scenes in this movie felt real. The relationships between Levitt and other characters felt real and how he treats them was expected. He didn't want a therapist so he gives her attitude. He is sick of his overbearing mother so he ignores her. He and his girlfriend don't have the best relationship which in this situation can be expected. It was Rogan and Levitt that had the best relationship because we see Levitt's character smile and be normal. It was good for him and better for the movie. The comedy came in at the right and wrong time but it really lacked. This movie straight up wasn't that funny. Rogan is the center of all the comedy, as he should have been, but I wanted to laugh more in this movie. I expected to laugh more in this movie. When the comedy was there it was hysterical. Something happens between Levitt and his girlfriend and Rogan's character is right in the middle and you can tell this scene was written by Rogan himself or completely improve. I was laughing so hard in this moment and a few others but the core of the movie is a cancer story. The dramatic moments are really well done but the majority of the movie is predictable. You have seen this movie before time and time again but it is still entertaining. I expected something a little different than what I got but predictable does not always mean bad. There were a few moments and outcomes I did not see coming but the majority I could have written myself. At first Levitt hates his young therapist. He is 27 and she 24, and it is obvious they grow on each other and become a love interest in the least expected of ways. In the cancer treatment center Levitt meets these two old guys who also have cancer and they are a riot. The first scene with the three of them was great. One of them gives Levitt pot cookies and that whole scene is great and hysterical. When the three of them are together it is pure entertainment, but then the drama bug comes around and kills one of them and we never see Levitt interact with the remaining one again. That was a shame but it was a big reality punch in the face. I felt really sad when he died and it hit me as hard as it hit Levitt. This movie touched me as it probably touched most people because we all know somebody who has cancer or is affected by another family member who has cancer. In a more cheerful note Seth Rogan is in this movie. I love Seth Rogan, he may play the laid back pot head in every movie but he does it so well. There are few people who could pull off what he did. He made a terrible situation not as terrible. He isn't laughing at cancer or saying it isn't a big deal, but he is saying it isn't the end of the world. You may have less time than the rest of us and that is unfortunate but he tries to make the best of it for his friend. Yeah there is that one scene where they use it to get laid but come on that would probably work in real life. Overall 50/50 is a dramatic comedy and one of the better ones I have seen. I'm not crazy about this genre but I am crazy about any movie Seth Rogan is in. I had doubts going into this movie and as predictable and emotional as it was, I did enjoy it. I had fun with this movie through my laughs and fighting back of tears. The characters all felt real and the endgame of all of them felt real. Levitt's father in the movie has Alzheimer's disease but in all honestly I thought it was wasted. I think he was supposed to be used for comedic relief but he isn't really used. He says a few lines but other than that he stands around and looks stupid. There were a lot of things I liked and a lot I didn't but it is still a solid movie I found entertaining so it gets a very high WillyT Recommendation."

","Both of my grandparents were diagnosed with cancer within the last 15 years, but thankfully they pulled through. Even with those experiences of a relative who had cancer, I realize that this is a very touchy subject.<br/><br/>Plot: Loosely based on screenwriter Will Reiser's experiences, Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a 27 year old public radio journalist who lives with his girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard) and one day out of the blue discovers he has a rare type of cancer and that he has a 50% chance of beating the cancer. With the help of his friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), his mother (Anjelica Huston) and his therapist Dr. Katherine McKay (Anna Kendrick), he struggles to beat the disease and learns what the most important things are in his life. <br/><br/>The performances in this movie are so spot on: Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character is so likable and there's one scene in particular when he got such an emotional response out of me. His performance in this film made him in one of my favorite actors ever. Seth Rogen is usually hit and miss for me, but this is best performance I've seen him give because he had me laughing my butt off so many times in this one. I love the way he catches Rachel cheating on Adam, and that made me say ""This guy is awesome!"" I remember seeing Anna Kendrick in ""Twilight"", ""New Moon"" and ""Eclipse"" and I was so annoyed by her in those films, but her performance in this film made me regret any bad thing/thought I said/had about her. Anjelica Huston as Adam's mother while overbearing, she portrays the character is such a loving way. And finally, Bryce Dallas Howard. I like her as an actress, and I think she did really good in her role, but her character was such a bitch! This film and ""The Help"" made me fell sorry for her because people keep casting her as a bad person. Whatever you do in your next film Bryce, please give somebody flowers! Special note: Phillp Baker Hall has a small role here, and he's really good in this one. Believe it or not, screenwriter Will Reiser makes a small appearance in the movie. Watch the scene where Adam's coworkers are trying to comfort him, Reiser is the one who says ""My uncle had what you had.""<br/><br/>The tone of this film feels realistic in terms of the kind of house Adam lives in, the dialogue between the characters, and the way the film handles the subject of cancer feels very light-hearted even though it does get emotional at times. Every time I watch this film, it reminds me of how great life is and that you have to appreciate the good that's in your life especially in your darkest time. There's really not much else I can say about this one. Great acting, great story and this is another reminder that we are still capable of making great movies."

","Young, smart men in their early 20s should not be knocking at death's door, and while we know that the Reaper waits for all men, getting a sneak peek at the mechanics of mortality holds a Dante-esque fascination. Mix in everyman color commentary from Seth Rogen (at his absolute best here) and 50/50 becomes an extraordinary observation on the cycles of life. Rogen is just the best friend - it is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, avid re-cycler and public radio producer, who is diagnosed with life-threatening cancer. His chances for survival are ""50/50"" and the all-consuming treatment that follows offers just enough of a clothesline on which to hang a number of moving and funny scenes. In addition to Rogen, we meet JGL's emotionally smothering mother (Angelica Huston, Oscar nomination ensured,) cruel girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard, Hiss) and the always terrific Anna Kendrick as JGL's therapist and, well, see the movie...."

","'50/50' tells the tale of a young, healthy man being given the shocking news that he has cancer of the spine despite not smoking, and taking care of himself in general.<br/><br/>This film really surprised me, I did expect it to be funny which it was, but I didn't expect it to be so powerful emotionally. <br/><br/>It's based on writer Will Reiser's experience alongside Seth Rogen when he found out he had cancer. The acting in this film is pretty good. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is excellent, he provides a lot of laughs and can evoke so much emotion from the audience it is unbelievable. As the film reaches its end emotions heighten and he really out-did himself with this performance. Seth Rogen was also great, he of course had real-life experience of the story and you can tell. His character is really funny and is a real strong point for this film. Anna Kendrick and Bryce Dallas Howard both act very well in this too though it would be nice to see Kendrick have more of a chance to show her capabilities instead of playing nearly the same character in every film, she performed very well however. Angelica Houston's character is one of the best ones in the film and she acts superbly. Having to deal with her husband who has a form of Dementia and her son who has cancer is a very difficult role to perform and she did so very well and put a lot of effort into her performance. <br/><br/>The script is really funny, there are moments where you will cry with laughter and other points where you will simply cry. I think the reason this comedic angle of cancer works so well here is because Will Reiser experienced it himself and knew exactly what points could and would be comedic and which points to really highlight and to show how difficult the subject is, with people suffering from similar illnesses dying around him.<br/><br/>Overall, I would really recommend this. It is a prime example of how films that deal with this subject should be able to provoke the right reaction from the audience. It will make you laugh and it will definitely make you cry."

","I went into 50/50 thinking it would be just a movie poking fun at cancer with him trying to use his cancer prognosis to pick up chicks but that's more or less just his friend trying to force him into that and not Joseph Gordon Levitt's character really into it at all. The story is about a young man in his 20's who gets unexpected news from his doctor that he has cancer. All the while he has a girlfriend who if it wasn't for the cancer news probably wouldn't have stayed with him so she's not really there for him and is a very selfish individual. He has to rely on his best friend played by Seth Rogen, his fellow patients getting their chemotherapy treatments and a young psychiatrist in training who he goes to deal with the issues of his situation.<br/><br/>With this movie and other stuff like (500) Days of Summer and being one of the hottest in demand actors right now JGL is definitely turning out to be one of the best actors of his generation."

","'50/50', Inspired by a true story, is a comedy centered on a 27-year-old guy who learns of his cancer diagnosis, and his subsequent struggle to beat the disease.

Jonathan Levine Directs this story well. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are passable. Music is excellent. Performance-Wise: Joseph Gordon-Levitt excels in the lead role. Seth Rogen is routine.

","Just watched 50/50. This movie was incredible. A content warning to start, there is language, depiction of recreational drug use, and one scene of intimacy that does not contain nudity. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was incredible as always so nothing new there but Seth Rogan delivers the best performance of his career. Seth's overt persona is nothing new but he masters his control of the subtle as he never has before to deliver a character you truly feel connected to by the end of the film. Anna Kendrick may have been type cast again but she truly fit in this role and did a great job. Overall I loved this movie and would recommend it to everyone with the one caveat being the content warning I started with."

","After a highly acclaimed critical buzz, ""50/50"" was introduced as a comedy about cancer, and it's heartbreaking effects. But, let me just say, that this movie is really laugh-out-loud funny. But, most of all, this is actually a heartwarming and dramatic tale, with a giant heart. This is one of the best movies of the previous year of 2011. With a well-written and heartwarming script by Will Reiser, which is based partially on his own personal experiences, ""50/50"" really shows how comedy and drama can mash up together, and it can make a really special film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers another winning screen performance as Adam Lerner, a 27-year old who surprisingly gets cancer, and now everyone is trying to help him out, from his gorgeous and unexplainable girlfriend, portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard, and his over-protective mother, portrayed brilliantly by Anjelica Huston. Anna Kendrick is just clear perfect as Katie, an unexperienced therapist who helps Adam during his rough time. The next thing we know, a real connection starts to grow during their daily sessions. Seth Rogen is just flat-out-funny, but just because we see this guy as a high pothead, that does not mean he can't also do drama. This guy has a big heart, and he's always there for Adam. Philip Baker Hall has his best and funny scenes playing Adam's fellow patient. The casting ensemble is just superb in this movie. Nearly everything in this movie is a mark of pure brilliance. The casting is brilliant, the script is well-written, the message is touching, the laughs are hilarious, and the drama is real. Directed brilliantly by Jonathan Levine, ""50/50"" really shows the true meaning of life itself, and it shows the fear that this could be the last day of your life. From the opening scenes to the end credits, ""50/50"" is one of the most heartwarming, dramatic, and comedic movies of this or any other year. The script, the cast, and the movie itself is perfect in every way. ""50/50"", in my review, ""a hilarious and heartwarming tale that impresses""."
"mirwais-orbit","5","3","6","21 April 2012"," 50/50 completely
","Well, 50/50 is the way I felt after watching it. Not bad, but not good. Not amazing, but not frustrating. Half comedy, half drama.<br/><br/>Written by Will Reiser and based on his life, I think that the movie fails badly first of all because this attempt to mix drama and comedy using a so difficult illness as cancer is something that naturally takes it to inevitable cliché moments.<br/><br/>Then you have all the main cast performing the same again. Joseph being that suffering personification as in (500) Days Of Summer (2009); Seth Rogen being that boring and over the top ""funny"" character that tries to make people laugh and forget that it's a drama; Bryce Dallas acting as the same selfish girl; Anna Kendrick the same insecure and enthusiast as in Up In The Air (2009); Angelica Houston the same old mother. And none of them giving a truly and brilliant performance.<br/><br/>And the result is the same movie about cancer and its difficulties of surviving. Javier Barden did it. Meryl Streep did it. Susan Sarandon did it. Michael Keaton, Emma Thompson, Debra Winger... and the list goes on. This is just another one. It seems honest, but it's cheesy instead, trying hard to be something. There are a few funny moments, but none of them for Seth Rogen's hard efforts. And a few tear moments for the right using of impacting scenes and score.<br/><br/>That's it and only, a movie to be watched on a rainy Sunday afternoon."

"born_naughty","7","3","6","15 January 2012"," Good, not great
","This is my first review ever so I'm still looking for the right way to do this. You can read the plot here so I'm going straight to the good and the bad.<br/><br/>I'm going to keep it simple. The good is, that there is almost a perfect balance between the drama of a young man being diagnosed with cancer and comic relief. That is, the first and last half hour of the film nail it perfectly. In the middle however there is to much comedy and profanity. I'm 24, it has nothing to do with my age, it just didn't fit in this film. The problem here is Seth Rogen. I'm a fan. I like all his movies and jokes. But he's supposed to be Joseph Gordon-Levitt's friend and all he does is try to get laid. Besides that, he doesn't show any human emotion what so ever, in the whole film. Seth Rogen could really prove to the world that he was a good drama actor, but he blew it. Then a couple of comments. Gordon-Levitt's performance is perfect. The perfect amount of (outside) putting everything in perspective and the pain you can see on his face. The story is well told but it should of focused a little more on the drama. Less on getting laid and more on the relationship with his girlfriend. This is a problem mainly in the middle 30 minutes of the film. <br/><br/>I give it a 7/10, I believe that without Seth Rogen, and more focus on the main character's problems, it was easily a 9 or 10 out of 10."
"JimmyCollins","6","3","6","29 November 2011"," A tad over hyped but still pretty funny.
","Who doesn't adore Seth Rogen? And who isn't lusting after Joseph Gordon Levitt? Not very many people, that's what makes this movie good, the unusual team up of these two polar opposite actors. So JGL gets cancer and of course he starts to lose his hair and all the other stuff that goes along with cancer treatment but there by his side is his trusty best friend Seth Rogen in all his comedic cliché but excellent glory.<br/><br/>It's pretty good that the subject of cancer can be used in TV and film and it not be a total drag and make you depressed, between this film and The Big C I think a lot of people are enjoying TV and movies about cancer. Seth Rogen does the film so much good, he's just such a lovable guy it's hard not to like him, JGL is also pretty good as usual also, although his character does sometimes get a bit boring. Anna Kendrick is so great in everything, she is a very talented young actress and I hope people like her continue to get the good roles, she manages to stand out in everything she's in.<br/><br/>I've heard so many great things about this movie, and I agree with a lot of it but it is a little over hyped, I mean it's good but i have seen better this year , in all honesty I don't think this movie will clean up in awards season, there's just too many other movies that are better.<br/><br/>This movie kinda brings together two audiences, the older generation who like serious films and the younger crowd who enjoy the Seth Rogen style comedies, and both audiences will be pleased. Check it out. :)"
"dish55","Null","3","6","21 October 2011"," Rogen Ruins It
","What could have been a low-key, extra-special slice of life story (featuring as it does a extra-special performance by the always extra-special JGL)is ruined by the unbelievable and crass performance of Seth Rogen who destroys any believability or good-will the story has built up every time he appears on screen. Movie-makers have got to realize a little bit of this fat-friend-with-the-dirty-mind-and-mouth-to-match goes a long way. Rogen has out-stripped his meager talents and worn out his welcome by now, and throwing such a putrid character in such a heart-warming story is a major mistake. Everyone else plays it on a realistic level - Anna Kendrick is wonderful as the therapist-in-training, and Anjelica Houston - well, what can I say? Joseph Gordon-Levitt positively lights up the screen every time he appears, but all too often he appears with the woefully charisma-challenged Rogen and, well, the movie and JGL's performance suffer accordingly."
"sdgreat","9","3","6","19 October 2011"," a potentially disastrous idea turns out to be both hilarious and poignant
","50/50 is being advertised as a ""comedy about cancer,"" which hardly sounds like a good idea for a movie, especially one that's advertised as ""from the creators of Superbad"". Cancer is obviously a very delicate subject, and there was as much risk that 50/50 could become too goofy and insensitive for its own good as there was for it to become too melodramatic and manipulative. I'm glad to say that the film is surprisingly poignant, realistic, and funny. For every crude joke, there are enough interesting character dynamics and real human emotions in this to make it a solid, thoroughly enjoyable and heart-wrenching film.<br/><br/>That fine balance between comedy and drama can partly be attributed to Will Reiser, who wrote the story and script based on his own experiences with cancer. The script manages to find enough humor in Adam's situation, mostly thanks to his friend Kyle's attempts at cheering him up (such as using his cancer to pick up girls). However, the story also makes sure to deal with the serious issues around the disease too, such as how Adam handles his situation and the various ill-effects of cancer treatment, as well as how his diagnosis effects his relationships with his overbearing mother, and his girlfriend.<br/><br/>While the script itself does a good job of bringing in humor to an fairly dramatic story, it's the actors who really bring out the emotions of those affected by Adam's disease. The supporting characters are all well cast. I have to admit that I'm not really a huge fan of Seth Rogen's usual raunchy style of humor, so I tended to get annoyed by a lot of his lines. However, he plays Kyle with the right amount of charm, and it works, for the most part. If you are a fan of his, I can't imagine you'd be too disappointed by his usual R-rated jokes. Plus, I heard that Kyle was actually based off of the real Seth Rogen, who is a friend of screenwriter Will Reiser, so who better to cast? Other strong supporting cast members include Anjelica Huston as Adam's over protective mother, who brings out just the right amount of sympathy for her character. Anna Kendrick also stars as Katherine, Adam's inexperienced therapist, and works well as the earnest, somewhat bumbling, young doctor.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie though, is quite easily Joseph Gordon Levitt as Adam. Levitt was perfectly cast in this role, and a lot of what I said about the film ""not getting melodramatic"" can be credited to his understated performance. He does a wonderful job of showing us what Adam is going through, from the initial shock, to his early optimism, and finally his succumbing to the fear that he really has no hope of survival. Watching Adam's journey, you really feel like you're getting to know him as a person, and understand what he's going through, which makes the climax all the more emotional. I can't imagine anyone reaching this scene without their heart racing, or even shedding a few tears.<br/><br/>Sometimes I get too caught up in reviews and such to notice how movies are actually doing at the box office. Considering the great critical reception for this film, I was surprised to see that it hasn't been all that popular at the box office. While the topic may sound like a strange one for a comedy, 50/50 works well, thanks to its well balanced script and a great cast, topped off by an award-worthy performance from Joseph Gordon Levitt. If you've been going back and forth on whether you should see this in theaters, or have been ignoring it because it might make you feel sad, I say go see it! It might make you cry, but you won't leave feeling sad. If anything, you'll leave the theater feeling uplifted by the story."

Anna Kendrick is cute, brilliant, and perfect for the role. Seth Rogen, his best performance yet, in my opinion. This movie is damn near perfect.

"chaz-28","9","3","6","1 October 2011"," Following the life of a young guy with cancer (Gordon-Levitt), 50/50 is profound and pure enjoyment
","Many films about cancer are actually only about 'movie cancer'. These have characters who say they are sick but their disease does not seem to interrupt their lives at all as they continue on normally until one day they unexpectedly disappear because of their phantom cancer. The rest of the films concerning cancer realistically show their characters with aches and pains, traumatic responses to chemotherapy, and emotional breakdowns. 50/50 shows real cancer and not the fake movie kind ala this month's Gus Van Sant film Restless.<br/><br/>Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a 27 year old sound editor for Seattle Public Radio. His relationship with his girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) is looking up as she is starting to spend more and more nights over at his house. Adam's best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) is also a major part of his life mainly as chauffeur, work mate, and deliverer of crude comedic one-liners. Adam has everything going for him and finally decides to head to the doctor to check out some nagging back pain. When the doctor blindsides him with a whole bunch of really long sounding words relating to a tumor on his spine, Adam's world stops on a dime and all of his plans and expectations just pack up and fly out the window.<br/><br/>He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink, and he recycles. How on Earth, especially at 27, could he have a tumor? Chemotherapy begins right away as does a myriad of other doctor visits and awkward sessions with a 24 year old therapist who looks even younger than that. Katherine (Anna Kendrick) is assigned as Adam's therapist to help him sort through his feelings; however, he has a very tough time adjusting to the fact that he is her third patient ever and their rapport takes an immediate hit when she has no idea who this Doogie Howser person Adam keeps mentioning is. Adam also notices how his friends and family relationships change regarding his disease. Which of his friends will step up and stick by him in his troubled times? Will his girlfriend stay supportive, will his best friend want to keep hanging around and will his mother (Anjelica Huston) be able to keep it together enough not become another emotional problem in his life? 50/50 was written by Will Reiser and is loosely based on his real experiences with cancer. Reiser is a frequent co-writer and friend of Seth Rogen which is why he shows up in the sidekick role here. Coincidentally or not, this is also a reprise of a character Rogen played in Funny People when he became Adam Sandler's sidekick when he had cancer. Rogen's character Kyle is very similar to his wise-cracking, vulgar characters from Knocked Up and Pineapple Express. In fact, it probably is the same character just with another name because he plays them exactly the same.<br/><br/>The two actors who really rise above the rest in 50/50 are Gordon-Levitt and Kendrick. Continuing a remarkable series of characters from 500 Days of Summer and Inception, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is very believable as a young guy who must come to grips with a new reality he did not sign up for. Also, the talented Anna Kendrick shows up in a very familiar role because the audience saw her do the same thing in Up in the Air; she plays a character where she is judged as too young to be effective. Unlike Seth Rogen, Kendrick is extremely capable and her scenes with Gordon-Levitt are as uncomfortable and stunted as they would be in a real hospital.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard has now played back to back roles as an extremely unsympathetic and callous character; this summer's The Help has Howard as a conniving villain. She should be careful lest she is typecast as the wicked witch next. Thankfully, Anjelica Huston is here in her juiciest role since 2007's The Darjeeling Limited or even 2004's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. She does not get too many plum roles anymore which is a shame because she steals the scenes she is in as the emotional wreck of a mother. She overshadows Gordon-Levitt and annihilates Seth Rogen when they share the screen.<br/><br/>I mentioned Restless earlier because both of these films were released close together, have a main character with cancer, and are even both based in the Pacific Northwest. 50/50 is supposedly shot in Seattle and has one or two establishing shots with the Space Needle in the background but the vast majority of it is obviously shot in British Columbia. 50/50 looks and feels that much better because I saw Restless recently and it was so ridiculous in how it showed a character with cancer that 50/50 shines bright above it.<br/><br/>Even though I complain about Seth Rogen's acting, 50/50 is a very powerful film and does not match the comedy its preview promises. There are scenes to laugh at, but there are many more which are truly deep and prompt meaningful responses from the audience. 50/50 is a delight to watch and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. You will be happy you took the time to seek this one out."
"colinrgeorge","Null","3","6","30 September 2011"," Drama, Comedy Split 50/50
","50/50 is the anti-MOW. Hot off the festival circuit as the much buzzed-about ""cancer comedy,"" its hype doesn't tell the whole story. Directed by Jonathan Levine (The Wackness), 50/50 is a dynamic blend of offhand humor and compelling character study. Just don't go in expecting one or the other.<br/><br/>Loosely based on his own experiences as a twenty-something cancer survivor, screenwriter Will Reiser assembles a flawed cast of characters for his retelling – himself most of all. Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is not a take-charge kind of guy. He greets his diagnosis with cynicism and reclusiveness, and at his age who can blame him? Holding his life at arm's length, he severs ties rather than strengthening them.<br/><br/>It's a notion that Levine actually undercuts. Whether it's his direction or just the conventions of a hero-narrative, Adam frequently comes off better than he deserves to. His cancer gives him carte blanche to abuse and ignore his friends and family, and it's important that those unflattering traits get their due. The cathartic climax is about tearing down those walls.<br/><br/>Levine is more forthcoming with the foibles of other characters. Seth Rogen plays Adam's pal Kyle, a predictably crass and outgoing foil to Gordon-Levitt's narcissistic introvert. Adam's girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes away looking particularly ugly, and is admonished by Kyle in one of 50/50's funniest scenes. Anjelica Huston and Anna Kendrick play Adam's overprotective mother and fledgling therapist, respectively, and Philip Baker Hall makes an appearance as a fellow cancer patient with an affinity for pot.<br/><br/>Rounding out the cast is Serge Houde as Adam's Alzheimer's-afflicted father. Unlike Adam however, his condition seems superfluous, occasionally lending 50/50 the maudlin air of an issue film. Which is odd, because elsewhere the filmmakers strive to remove sentimentality from the equation. In fact, the nitty-gritty of Adam's treatment is relegated almost entirely to off-screen action. The film focuses instead on the impact it has on his life. Consequently, and in the interest of levity, the threat is diluted.<br/><br/>In that respect, 50/50 isn't even about cancer. The common storytelling mistake, as Reiser sees it, is treating the disease as subject; Reiser's subject is himself. Cancer is just the shitty thing that happened to him. The film begins like any other buddy comedy, and initially feels stilted because of it. Even the obligatory reveal and diagnosis of the disease comes across awkward. But it gradually builds into something significant.<br/><br/>The beauty of 50/50 is in the way its characters behave and bounce off each other. There's no bromance a la I Love You, Man – the friendship portrayed by Gordon-Levitt and Rogen is subtler. Adam's eventual turn from reticence to reliance makes his transformation as a character more compelling than his struggle with cancer. After all, it's not about that.<br/><br/>I don't envy the marketing team tasked with selling 50/50 to the general audience. Cancer isn't exactly a crowd-pleaser, but you can't bill it as a comedy without being at least a little disingenuous. Resier and Levine's film delivers a unique hybrid of emotion and entertainment that tries, not always successfully, to pave new territory – which is admirable in and of itself. Whether 50/50 is remembered more as a cavalier drama or dark comedy remains to be seen, but you can bet it won't go down in history as another after school special."

","This was a disappointment of a movie. Everything good about it was shown in the trailer. It quickly lost my interest and attention as the acting was below par, artificial, and the emotion of the serious storyline was not delivered well. There was nothing extremely likable about any of the characters, in fact most of them were annoying. We had a jerk friend, a cheating girlfriend, an overbearing mother, and an incredibly stupid therapist who should never be allowed a license. There were a few funny parts but most of it was typical Seth Rogan humor. In other words 90% of what comes out of his mouth is about weed or getting laid, both of which get very old after a short time. It was a cliché ending with him being guaranteed to be okay and him going out with the therapist. This was almost an insult to the viewer's intelligence. It isn't like none of us saw that coming from the moment they met. Overall it was a waste of time. I would not recommend this, the trailer is all you need to see."

","The role isn't quite as challenging for Joseph G-L as some of his recent stuff has been, but nobody could have done this better. It's a good reminder of how versatile he is. The 50/50 refers to his chances of surviving (or dieing) from cancer, with which he has just been diagnosed. The movie handles it well with a good balance of drama and humor, much of the latter of which comes from Seth Rogen in one of his best roles. Anna Kendrick is cute, stunning and adept all at the same time. To sum it up, it could have been titled, ""50/50: Or How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Big C"".

Well, this film was anything BUT comedy. It was endearing and emotional. Gordon-Levitt was brilliant in this film. No other actor could have played a cancer-stricken, young man, and fighter like him. No other actor. It was refreshing to see Rogen in this film as well. His character truly cared about his best dude, and while, it takes a while to see just how much he cares, there is payoff.

He plays the broken but brave best friend to perfection, never willing to let his friend believe that its over but secretly knowing that this could well be it. It takes you on the emotional journey of the sufferer and his immediate circle of family and friends. It highlights the high points which are uplifting and the low points which are heartbreaking. It grabs hold of you and gives you an indication of what cancer is like, how it affects you and how it can damn well destroy you if you let it. But it also teaches you to never give up.

"dougwintersmusic","Null","2","4","11 October 2011"," 50/50 Four Young Actors, Showing Why Their At The Top Of Their Class
","50/50 is a truly extraordinary movie. This is a mini-masterpiece that is as thoughtful and compelling as it is funny and real. Written by Will Reiser and directed by Jonathan Levine 50/50 faces the emotional devastation of cancer as well the physical ravages of chemotherapy with the perfect mixture of pathos, wit and compassion, steering away from melodrama. This is clearly no accident as our protagonist Adam, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt starts the conversation with his mother about his potentially lethal diagnosis by asking her if she was familiar with ""Terms Of Endearment."" Mr. Gordon-Levitt appears in virtually every frame of the movie allowing us to see the confusion, pain, fear and virtually every other possible emotion without letting us feel pity for this kind, rather unremarkable young man. Adam innocently makes an appointment with a doctor to find out why the pain in his back won't go away, only to find that that he has a large malignant tumor pressing on his vertebrae. In a state of shock he begins the process of hopeful healing, including ""chemo,"" hence the famous head shaving scene. The scenes when he is receiving the chemotherapy are shared with Philip Baker Hall as Alan, a fellow cancer patient. These hospital scenes could easily have been a devise for gallows humor or cornball father/son wisdom, but instead Adam and his Alan make easy conversation and Alan introduces his younger friend to the joys of medicinal marijuana.<br/><br/>Adam's support group is led by his best (and seemingly only) friend Kyle, played to understated perfection by the wonderful Seth Rogen (who is also one of the producers of the film) and his less-than-supportive girlfriend Rachel played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who earlier this summer played another unsympathetic role in ""The Help."" Anna Kendrick plays Adams young psychologist Katherine, who is actually the female equivalent to Adam. She is nervous, shy timid and loveably unsure of herself, Ms. Kendrick burst on the scene in the wonderful ""Up In The Air,"" going step for step with George Clooney, and she does not fail to live up to those expectations. She is all sweetness and light and exudes an unparalleled sense innocent charm.<br/><br/>Anjelica Huston appears as Adam's overbearing mother, but plays her role with the same subtlety as the rest of the young cast. It would have been so easy to go over-the-top as the prototypical Freudian cliché nightmare ""mother-from-hell."" She is a woman dealing with her own tragedy as the sole caretaker of her Alzheimer-stricken husband (Serge Houde), when she learns of her son's illness. adding burden on top of burden. She is far more to be pitied, than scorned. Ms. Huston is as wonderful as you'd expect her to be.<br/><br/>Most of the movie relies on the chemistry between Rogan's Kyle and Gordon-Levitt's Adam. They truly deliver, without a single reference to the unfortunate term ""bromance."" This is a wonderfully, subtle, nuanced, deeply thoughtful piece of filmmaking. Bravo."
"meeza","Null","2","4","7 October 2011"," I give 50/50 more than a 50/50 chance to have movie staying power!
","Due to my over 50 certifiable corny puns that I insert in my film reviews, there will be most probably more than a 50/50 chance that you will find my review of the new comedy-drama ""50/50"" very ""repunant"". See what I mean! Anyways, let me cut to the chase. ""50/50"" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Adam, a Seattle radio journalist who in his mid 20's is diagnosed with a form of spinal cancer; too ""syllabistic"" to pronounce. Adam, as anyone would be, is first stricken back with his diagnosis and even though he maintains his resiliency is still internally profoundly hurt with the situation. He finds some sort of zany support from his best friend Kyle, who is with Adam through the cancer battle, but actually uses Adam's sickness to meet beautiful women. Kyle is portrayed by Seth Rogen, who ironically enough lived his Kyle role when supporting best friend Will Reiser through his cancer ordeal a few years ago. And Reiser even rose up through the challenge and wrote the ""50/50"" screenplay. Adam's girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) does her best (or better her worst) to support Adam through the ordeal. Adam does get mental aide from a perky newbie psychiatrist Katherine played by Anna Kendrick. Adam also receives some ""I am there with you"" support from a couple of older cancer patients Alan (Phillip Baker Hall) and Mitch (Matt Brewer) who share chemistry and chemotherapy with Adam. The legendary Angelica Houston portrays Adam's overbearing but loving mother Diane. What makes ""50/50"" primarily work as a medication for narrative dullness are the eccentric characters in the film, and Reiser's witty screenplay in authentically balancing out the gravity of the situation with respectful comedic doses. All of the performances get a first-rate diagnosis especially the under-appreciated Gordon-Levitt and the alluring Kendrick; I was psyched up mentally and physically in their scenes together. Rogen was his usual ""rogenish"" but was the film's primary comic relief. And I could live to forever to watch Phillip Baker Hall performances. I am glad that Director Jonathan Levine stayed alive with the ""50/50"" project because the director usually has more than 50% accountability on a movie's success or failure; and in this case it was more of the former than the latter. ""50/50"" is a movie I could view more than 50 times, and the percentage shows that you will second that notion. I hope there is more than a 50/50 chance you will see this gem as soon as possible. ***** Excellent"

","At first I didn't know what the climate of this film would be. It co-stars Seth Rogan but I didn't know if it would be OK to laugh. It's about cancer but I didn't know how I would end up feeling. Well, it felt real. And it WAS OK to laugh. Matter fact, the movie covers the topic of cancer in a revolutionary way. We feel the gravity of the disease, the toll it takes on all those affected, the uncertainty of the prognosis. Yet, we also get to be silly, to laugh, to make jokes, to LIVE through this with the antagonist. Rogan and Joseph Gordon-Levitt work very well together. The story-line is smart, the script is engaging, the laughs aren't contrived. It's just a good overall movie. And it's one where we don't really know what's going to happen with Gordon-Levitt's character until it all happens. I liked that because it really does keep you tuned in, waiting along with him until the end. Definitely go see 50/50. <br/><br/>austininwonderland.tumblr.com"
"ronakkotian","8","0","0","18 June 2020"," Simple but effective
","There was a time where Joseph Gordon-Levitt had a really promising career. Seeing him in Inception and Don Jon showed me how capable he was. It's sad we don't get to see him nowadays because he had huge potential and 50/50 is a great example of his acting abilities.<br/><br/>50/50 follows Adam, a young man who gets diagnosed with a rare type of cancer and has a 50% chance of living and we see how he struggles to fight against the disease.<br/><br/>This is a film that is the definition of simple but effective. The story is not complicated at all but it's told in a very lighthearted and touching way. Writer Will Reiser found a great balance between comedy and drama as they never clash with one another. There's not a moment where the comedy goes too far or the film gets overdramatic. It's all kept fairly realistic which makes the story all the more believable. It may feel weird having comedy in a film about a dark subject like cancer but it's used in a way to show the positive side of it. It shows us how we should live our life to the fullest and always keep on smiling day in day out no matter what.<br/><br/>The performances by every single actor is spectacular. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is absolutely terrific here and makes us feel really sympathetic towards him due to what he goes. Seth Rogen is perfect for playing Joseph Gordon-Levitt's best friend. He's very funny throughout and there's a great amount of character development to him. Anna Kendrick is also great and the bond she builds with JGL is executed brilliantly. Anjelica Huston and Bryce Dallas Howard also do their roles justice.<br/><br/>The writing in this film is excellent. It's clear how Will Reiser takes his own personal experience and makes something incredibly moving. I love how each character develops and the impact they have on Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character which helps him grow as a result.<br/><br/>50/50 was executed really well surprisingly. It's got a great amount of humour to make you laugh and a great amount of drama that's both emotional and heartwarming."

","An absolutely poignant, refreshing, and deeply emotional film, 50/50 takes more than another step into unforeseen territory with its unique approach on a cancer story that is both at times hard to watch and yet surprisingly funny. Joseph-Gordon Levitt gives a great performance as Adam, truly capturing the most of his unfortunate experience and situation with such gripping emotion you'll forget he's simply just acting. Seth Rogen also provides the film with its comedic relief, unsurprisingly, but does prove to be more than a worthy addition to the film and his character certainly makes for some quite hilarious moments. Most of the supporting cast in total is also quite good. The film's script is layered and seemingly perfectly executed, and its cinematography truly captures the feel and tone of the film. In the end, 50/50 was a surprisingly funny, moving, and remarkable film- that is not only bound to stand the test of time, but captures the hearts of everyone watching along.

","""50/50"" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen, Anna Kendrick, Bruce Dallas Howard, Anjelica Huston, and many more, and is directed byJonathan Levine. Jonathan is known for his work in ""Long Shot"" and ""Warm Bodies"", which are both incredible films, but this is one of his older projects, as this came out in 2011. This film is about a man named Adam, who works in radio, he's very healthy, and he recycles a lot. He is dating a girl named Racheal, and is very close with is best friend Kyle. But Adam seems to have very painful back aches every now and then, and when he goes to check with a doctor, it is later revealed that he suffers from a spinal tumour, which unfortunately gives him cancer. But he has a fifty percent chance of survival. So Adam seeks help from his friends, and a therapist named Katherine, who is 24.<br/><br/>This film, was so hilarious, but also very tragic in many ways. Never did this film become to funny, nor overly sad. This film never drags, even when Adam is just lying on the couch, it never feels boring, there's always something happening, wether is was emotionally, physically, etc. As an audience, you really feel that this person is irritated with this illness very much, he can no longer do things that he could do before life sleeping with women, he didn't even have the chance to get his driver's license. This man is torn to his core. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the best part of this film, this was by far his most underrated role, and one his best roles, if not his best role. Obviously one of the most hilarious scenes in the film are whenever Adam hangs out with Kyle. Kyle cares very much for Adam. He takes him to his appointments, he takes him out to cheer him up, they even smoke weed. He is the most hilarious part of the film no doubt, and Seth Rogen portrays the character so well. Racheal, who was Adam's former girlfriend, really isn't s good girlfriend at all whatsoever. She was never there for Adam when he desperately needed him, she never took care of him, and there's one major thing that she did, but I won't go into that as it contains heavy spoilers. And Katherine, was probably the most positive part of the film. She's a 24 year old therapist, and you first see her you directly know that she's obviously new to this, as Adam was her third patient thus far. She always tries to enlighten this man, who is trying to stay calm most of the time, but when he has a breakdown in front of this girl, who is really trying to help him, who really does care about Adam, it's heartbreaking. She is always there when he needs her for anything, she gives him rides home, she loves this patient, and Adam loves her.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film for people who want to be humoured, or for people who enjoy upbeat but serious films. This movie has no flaws that bring this down. This is never a boring movie, and all the performances in this film are incredible."

"w_kiefer","10","0","0","17 July 2019"," Poignant, humorous, and uplifting.
","So many movies portray cancer as such a dramatic, serious thing. While the disease itself certainly is serious and dramatic, this movie shows how two young, virile, energetic goofballs go about life after a diagnosis of such life-changing proportions.
The short answer is: any way they can.
Seth Rogen does such a terrific job of being Seth Rogen and, at the same time, a rock for his downtrodden, emotionally distressed, potentially dying friend.
That's why I think this movie works so well. These two guys are just a bunch of buddies who hardly take anything serious and spend the majority of their time just chilling with each other without ever having to analyze their friendship.
When Adam (Levitt) gets diagnosed he is suddenly swept off of his happy-go-lucky-live-forever perch and plunged into the dark world of chemotherapy, aches, midnight vomit, and mortality. His best friend Kyle (Rogen) is completely blown away and is simply trying to figure out what way to be there for his friend and deal with his own feelings at the same time. That's a difficult position to be in and I think he navigates that turbulence by partying, drinking, having fun, and living in the moment and taking Adam along for the ride. He has to be strong for his best friend but it's hard because he is scared of losing him. Like I said, it's very poignant and Levitt and Rogen act it beautifully."

It presents a realistic look at a life-changing event, with excellent performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick. Seth Rogen plays his usual, irreverent self. I think the reason that this film succeeds is because it feels honest."

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt who has played very colorful quirky characters, now plays a rather dull Adam, a man who plays by the rules and still gets cancer at an early age because he has bad genes. Seth Rogen is his uncouth best friend who is far more likeable. The non-conformist in me was glad Adam got cancer as opposed to Kyle. The humor is low impact. It wasn't LOL funny. For instance Katherine (Anna Kendrick) is Adam's stress counselor. She is 24 and just a delight, thank you Anna. Adam makes a remark about Doogie Howser. She doesn't know who he is and asks, ""Does he work here?"" We discover that the more syllables a cancer name has, the worse it is.<br/><br/>His GF Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) becomes less supportive as Adam is not her only interest. Like ""Man in the Moon"" (for those who like funny movies about cancer) the film gets sadder as it progresses. As a cancer patient you get to make friends with other cancer patients, bond with them, and go to their funeral.<br/><br/>Anjelica Huston did an excellent job as Adam's mother for the short time she was on the screen. The acting was good. The script was up and down. Joseph Gordon-Levitt starts out as the weakest person in the film. It wasn't until he told Rachael to get off his porch does his character pick up and we start to develop respect for him. He is able to take us through a cornucopia of emotions from euphoria to despair. The film starts out as a 6 star comedy, but ends as a 10 star drama.<br/><br/>F-bomb, sex talk, sex, brief shadowy nudity."

","Levitt as the son with Cancer gets credit from me for playing a difficult role very well. Seth Rogan is a good co-star who has some shining moments. The women here all do well, from the one dimensional ones (one night stands) to the main ones. Kendrick is one of 2 red heads that shines in this one. I thought when watching this that one of the one-night fun women that they meet in a night club sounds exactly like Mila Kunis. Maybe this is an uncredited cameo or maybe another actress has her voice?<br/><br/>The story does present a balance that any disease like Cancer is not fair. It is a little wild in that the disease can be used to hit on women. To the films credit, it balances that by the guys who are older victims of the disease and showing how miserable it is when the disease wins. Real life takes turns that often do not agree with anyone, and there are times that the media trys to put everyone in the same category using group think about issues.<br/><br/>This one gets outside the box on the issue of Cancer and avoids the sterotypes that are often associated with the illness. It does have some R rated language, but then it is appropriate. Worth a look for the way the subject is handled and a talented cast doing it well with a good script."

","If you've paid attention to cinema for the past decade, you'll probably recognize Seth Rogen as the guy who wants to spend eternity smoking pot with his friends while they discuss bodily functions. But he gets a different role in Jonathan Levine's ""50/50"". He plays the friend of a cancer-stricken radio journalist (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). The movie manages to balance comedy and drama, as the friends have their usual fun while the neurofibrosarcoma-stricken Adam gets ready for chemotherapy. In the process, we meet Adam's overprotective mother, her Alzheimer's-afflicted husband, and some other people. Probably the most interesting character in the movie is Anna Kendrick's therapist-in-training. New to her job, she does what she has to.<br/><br/>So, this is a movie that shows that even these guys who mostly star in silly movies can be versatile. Which is not to subtract from the performances of Kendrick, Anjelica Huston, Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer. A fine piece of work."

","I was a little skeptical about this film before watching it, I suspected the high ratings might be because of the subject matter (sensitive subjects such as cancer always seem to get high ratings, regardless of the actual worthiness of the film). But in this case I was wrong, and was in for a good surprise. The seriousness of the subject was balanced with humour in just the right amount. The acting by Gordon-Levitt and Kendrick was outstanding; and Rogen, whom I normally avoid like the plague, gave a surprisingly honest and deep performance. The film deals with many issues related to serious illnesses such as cancer, especially in how friends, acquaintances and relatives react to the patient, and also how the patient deals with it all. Definitely an emotional film, and definitely worth watching."

","Tragic comedies have the reputation of crossing certain lines that make people feel uncomfortable. By harmonizing both tragedy and comedy, people often have no idea how to feel. That is not the case with 50/50. With every depressing twist, there's always a laugh following and you find yourself loving it. It's a 'feel good' movie but with life lessons intertwined. Will Reiser, the screenplay writer, bases the experiences of the main character, Adam (Joseph Gordon- Levitt), on his own personal incidents. Adam learns he has a very rare and deadly cancer in his back. Since the doctors are unware as to when the cancer will take Adam's life, the constant worry as to when it might happen keeps audiences at the edge of their seat.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen, who plays Adam's best friend, displays an imposing performance as always. His involuntary wit and canniness adds sparkle to Adam's depressing life. Adam's girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) insists on being the type to deal with illness when it's quite obvious she isn't. This causes troubles within the film – but interesting troubles that the audience can easily correlate with. While Adam is dealing with other saddening issues in his life, his mother is dealing with them as well. Adam's father has dementia and his mother has a hard time not having the opportunity of smothering Adam in his time of need. This adds an emotional aspect to the film that you would have never expected. Each event that takes place is extremely down-to-earth and understandable. You find yourself laughing, developing anger, feeling weak, and finding relief all in the one hour and 40 minutes. Certain incidents in the film are what society would call corrupt or perverse but that is what makes it so digestible - we all have been in the same situations. On top of that you also have some insight on things you have not yet realized. You come out of the movie gaining an agonizing experience that you would not have received elsewhere. <br/><br/>It's not a shock that Joseph Gordon-Levitt received 'Actor of the Year' for his acting within this movie. His realistic acting skills blew the audience away while portraying the character. Throughout the movie, you get to see the 5 stages of grief as he learns about the cancer. There's never any question as to which stage he occupies - from his dramatic outbursts, to his constant laughing, to his helpless vibe, Gordon-Levitt expresses each emotion perfectly. The originality of the movie is excellent despite the one element that happens in almost every film regarding this genre. When Adam first meets his therapist Katherine (Anna Kendrick) you quickly assume that at some point or another the two will begin to have feelings for each other. Apparently, Hollywood still won't stray away from the whole 'guys and girls can't just be friends' kind of thing. Through therapy you see Adam begin to become more flirtatious towards Katherine while she tries to stay as professional as possible. This part of the plot flows well nicely with the whole movie but it tends to be a little predictable. Other than this, originality pours out of Reiser's creation. Various lessons are learned in unique ways throughout the film and you find yourself a different person after."
"Floated2","7","0","0","19 February 2017"," Interesting Take
","50/50 (2011) is a different take of a serious drama (with mixed comedic elements) from Seth Rogen. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is heartbreaking yet understated as twenty-something cancer sufferer Adam, though at many times his character comes off as completely unlikable which makes it hard to root for him.<br/><br/>Though within the film, Seth Rogen's as the best friend Kyle steals majority of the film with his typical wise cracks and Seth Rogen type humor. I can understand many people disliking his character but there is a certain charm to it, and his character elevates the film. <br/><br/>50/50 has been praised for its serious topic surrounding cancer and the method in which the film goes about it. Although the film is predictable (in the end), it is quite an interesting take."

I loved seeing the story of a young fellow who is having a healthy life got a cancer from no where and without any reason that makes anyone feel that, he got this to himself, it was totally his destiny and he has nothing to do with it. what makes it more harder that it is a rare kind of tumor that is hard to be treated. So you go through his story and his relationships with his family, friend, girlfriend & his therapist.<br/><br/>All the actors were so great, starting from his father which had only one scene to express his feelings and it totally touched me, and his mother who loves him but in the way that all mums do and we don't like it, to his friend which is played by Seth Rogen who has really great in this role and I loved him a lot, and I will neglect his girlfriend because I just hated her which by the way means that (Bryce Dallas Howard ) did it right.

"mbh42498","9","0","0","27 March 2016"," Notable efforts from a cast (and Seth Rogen)
","What I enjoy about 50/50 is that it isn't too far fetched from regular life under these circumstances. A 27 y/o gets a rare cancer that is not commonly diagnosed or beaten, meets with a young and attractive therapist (which is convenient for us and plot development), has a protective mother, and a Seth Rogen-type friend. <br/><br/>Everything that Adam does in this movie is based upon these characters,who all act very stereotypically towards a guy with cancer. His mother gets regresses to when she was a primary caretaker. After the breakup with his girl friend, Kyle takes Adam under his wing through marijuana and sex. He tries to push Adam even farther away from his now- ex by convincing him to be carefree about her, and even disrespecting her a little bit. Bros before hoes.<br/><br/>Something my teacher brought up is that therapists are not allowed to touch a client without permission. Anna Kendrick at this time does not abide by this, being she's only 24 and still inexperienced. Although it's valid to say that this is unrealistic of a therapist to stray from this ethic, it's also valid to remember she is still kinda new. With only 3 patients and still in training, she's a rookie. It's just that humanly error and convenient characteristic for plot development that makes this movie more heartfelt. <br/><br/>Adam is pretty likable as the main character of this movie. The guy gets a threatening cancer diagnosis at a young age where it's very likely he'll die. What happens to him are plausible events, minus going out to get laid. I understand that people tend to pity someone who suffers, but would a girl really have a stand with a cancer patient? I just don't see that happening. His whole conflict with his girlfriend, plausible to display of character. You can't expect a loved one to not feel struck with so much stress during the time. It takes a strong woman like his mother to take care of someone with such a physical or mental disease.<br/><br/>With all that said, I've become a much bigger fan of Joseph Gordon Levitt and Anna Kendrick. The first time I really watched anything of Levitt in depth was 10 things I hate about you. What I learned is that he was a child actor as well. He has really come such a long way since then, as he actually turned out to be a respectable actor. And now I can't stop obsessing over Anna Kendrick. She has the confidence of Tina Fey without being over the top and obnoxious like some other characters, plus charm and beauty. I love the ending as well; the interaction that we've seen from them, you just want to smile every scene. I know I did, how they were always so awkward with one another until they call.<br/><br/>The music chosen and played for this movie is pretty good too as it helps define the mood. I don't think any songs were produced a few years within this movie, and if there are then they certainly aren't mainstream songs that are used like they are today. There also are some songs not included in the soundtrack that are subtle and delicate, but add to then moment when no one is talking. The use of guitar solos in some scenes is very original compared to rap.<br/><br/>I could easily watch this movie repeatedly because of everything about it. The real, yet fun, scenarios make this one of the cast's finer works. Often I find myself searching for certain clips of this movie, because it was so enjoyable to watch. Another Kendrick or Levitt movie is next on my list, considering how great this one was."

"midas-jacobs","9","0","0","20 March 2016"," A comedy, that isn't really a comedy
","50/50 is about Adam. Adam is a normal guy who doesn't drink, nor smokes, but when he gets diagnosed with cancer his life turns upside down. In this movie we see how he handles this situation.<br/><br/>I want to start this review of by saying that the directing of the movie was very good. This was his third time directing a feature film. And this was also his best feature film. It was well directed, and done by Jonathan Levine, a man who I had never heard before, but now I want to watch other movies that are directed by him. The cinematography of 50/50 was pretty to. There wasn't a single shot that I thought could have been done better. This was done by Terry Stacey. 50/50 is by far his best movie. If you want to compare, he is also known for the cinematography ""Dear John"", and ""PS I love you"". So you will see why I say this. But that is all I really have to say about this part in my review, the best parts mostly lay in the acting, and writing, so let's go over to that bit.<br/><br/>First, the acting. This was very good. The characters felt real, and acted like real people. The main character of 50/50 is Adam, the one who get's cancer. He has a 50 percent chance of surviving with his type of cancer, thats why the movie is called that way. Adam was played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I have disliked him for quiet a bit, but since I have seen more of his movies (Inception, Looper, The Dark Knight Rises, etc.) I have started to like him more, and started seeing him as a good actor. And in this movie he has proved that thing again. He was very convincing, and looked like a real person. His love interest, and girlfriend is Rachael. She was played by Bryce Dallas Howard. She was good too. But the one that surprised me the most is Seth Rogen. I think that he is most of the time annoying in a movie. But he surprised me very much, because I liked him in 50/50. His character was also funny. How he reacts in the art gallery really fits his character, and if you have seen the movie, you will know what I mean. What also proves the great acting of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen, is when Adam shaves of his hair. This was all improvised, and I didn't know that until I read the trivia on IMDb. They stayed in character very well. But let's move on to the next character/actress. She was my favorite one, because I could relate to her character. This was Katherine, played by Anna Kendrick. Katherine is a very messy person, not only physically, but also kind of mentally. She is not to good with other people, but it suits her, and makes her character someone cute. Kendrick did a amazing job at portraying this character. But these are the actors that I wanted to discus. Now I will move on to the script and writing.<br/><br/>In this paragraph I want to start of with this thing: The script was amazing. 50/50 is not your ordinary comedy. It makes you laugh at times, but also cry. I wouldn't actually call this a comedy. Yes, It has funny bits in it, and yes, the contrast between Adam and Kyle (Seth Rogen) was funny, but there were more sad scenes than funny ones. The scene in which Adam starts to drive in Kyles car, and stops, where after he starts crying and screaming, isn't funny at all. This was very good character development, though, but still. There are more moments like these in the movie than moments where they burn down a painting, or the scene from Kyle in the art gallery. Like I have said in my third paragraph, the characters are great. They feel like real people, people you could meet on the street. What I also liked is the chemistry between Adam and Kyle, but also Adam and Katherine. In the movie you can see the relationship develop. From Adam being annoyed by Katherine, to loving her. And the chemistry between Adam and Kyle was good too. As I have said, this is a funny bit, but also shows the friendship between them. The dialogue is good too, nothing really outstanding, but it was good.<br/><br/>That is all I have to say about 50/50. I think that this movie is very good, and that it is impressive that they have made a good comedy- drama from a dark subject."

","Drama's are usually not the kind of movies I'm going for but with this one I'm glad I did. I would not really call it a comedy even though there were some funny moments with Seth Rogen. But it's about cancer and like most of us eventually in life we get to know somebody that struggled or died because of cancer. And it's not a pretty decease to watch evolve. But nevertheless the bit of humor there was in the movie perfectly balanced out the tragedy of having cancer. It kind of reminded me the excellent show The Big C. Joseph Gordon-Levitt seems to never grow up. He still looks so young. I always have to think about 3rd Rock from the Sun when I see him but in 50/50 he proves he can play something else then pure comedy. The movie itself is very easy and pleasant to watch even though it's about that nasty decease and there are frequent sad moments. It might not please everyone to watch it but I'm sure for a lot of people that were confronted with cancer it will cheer them up a little. Better then I expected."

We sure did get lucky with this one. The movie had a little bit of everything without being too much, it's difficult to explain but this is a must see. There were funny parts, romantic parts, and sad parts - so it's hard to really put it into a category. It's kind of a category of its own really. One of the things I enjoyed most is how they portrayed cancer, and how they showed the toll it takes on everyone involved. It was so real. Nothing was sugar coated, I feel like it was a true story. The movie itself was so creatively made and different from anything I have ever seen. All of the actors were perfect for their rolls, and although Rogan is known for funny pointless rolls he did great in this. He kept true to his funny-guy reputation while still having a serious side which was perfect for his character.

","What a good movie. I laughed a bunch of times as well as tearing up a couple times, too. The subject matter is heavy: cancer, and the story looks the problem right in the face without flinching. The characters keep their humor and humanity throughout. This is not a movie that is trying to place blame, correct a rotten system or go for cheap laughs...well maybe it goes for one or two cheap laughs, Seth...it's just showing people dealing with a bad situation the best way they can. The film is really well done, hitting both high notes and low ones. I recommend it highly. Along with his movie ""The Lookout,"" Joseph Gordon-Levitt is building a nice filmography.<br/><br/>My only complaint with ""50/50"" is that the peripheral characters behave a little too conveniently. Realistically, there would've been much more turmoil with the ex-girlfriend and father. The movie wasn't overly long, so a bit more depth and friction around those two relationships could have made a good movie even better."
"hoernkeem","7","0","0","25 July 2015"," Equal parts humor and melodrama combine for a decent flick about a young man living with a cancer diagnosis
","This is a well thought out well executed movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt's character is a boy scout of a person who doesn't smoke, drink or even walk across the street unless the traffic signal is green. Despite this behavior he gets cancer and is given the titular 50/50 chance of survival. So begins a fine balancing act between heart warming comedy and weepy, tear inducing melodrama. There are some cries and some chuckles along the way. The movie steers clear of the really deep, dark, depressive places that one might dwell. This whole endeavor has that 'Average Joe' sort of feel that really works for this narrative. Seth Rogen does an excellent job as the slacker best friend who embraces his friend's plight but also isn't above trying to use his condition to score with the ladies. The only part of the story that is hokey and flimsy is the love story. Within seconds of meeting all the players you know exactly how the love story angle will turn out and the part played by Bryce Dallas Howard seems more caricature than actual character. This is mostly a good story though that quite deftly walks the line between the sadness and hardship of such an endeavor while also capturing the humor that still remains even in the face of death."

","I was quite hesitant about watching this film as comedy and terminal illness are two things I wouldn't expect to mix very well. However, the names involved pulled me in and I actually thought it was beautiful.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt is your average man who discovers that he has cancer and that his chances of survival are 50/50. The film follows his attempts to cope with his illness, his struggles with his treatment and the difficulties these two elements cause between him and his loved ones. Gordon-Levitt handles the serious of the illness, and portrays a sweet, vulnerable character that's irresistible to the audience whilst Kendrick, the psychiatrist he goes to to help him through this awful time, takes the edge of with her lovable awkwardness. This means that you don't feel guilty for being amused when Rogen delivers his vulgar belly laughs as Gordon-Levitt's best friend who has good intentions but is in denial about how serious his friend's condition is. <br/><br/>It's a different, sensitive story for the comedy world that is carefully handled and brilliantly told."
"brchthethird","7","0","0","26 March 2015"," Has enough humor and heart to elevate it beyond similarly-themed films
","While it could have gone the route of being maudlin and going for a cheap emotional gut punch, 50/50 is a fairly well-written, honest portrayal of someone who finds out they have cancer. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, a guy who ""doesn't smoke...and recycles"" but finds out that he has a rare form of spinal cancer. Together with his friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) and a novice therapist (Anna Kendrick), he eventually comes to terms with his condition despite the many setbacks he experiences. Chief among these is a cheating girlfriend (Dallas Bryce Howard). I mean, what girl would cheat on her boyfriend after he finds out he has cancer? That was pretty low, and made her character extremely unlikeable. Of course, most of the central cast is unlikeable in some way. Adam becomes kind of a prick once he finds out about his condition, although this is somewhat understandable. Less understandable, although it's intrinsic to the type of characters Seth Rogen usually plays, is Kyle who uses Adam's condition as a way to hook up with women. Even though I can understand that someone who finds out they have a potentially terminal illness might use it to score, actually seeing it play out in a movie was kind of crass to me. Thankfully, the film doesn't stay there. Generally speaking, the plot was rather predictable in terms of the romantic aspect. You just kind of know that after Adam breaks up with his girlfriend he'll eventually end up with his cute therapist because that's just the way things work. I can almost forgive it since Anna Kendrick played such a dorky, likable person, but clichés are still clichés. I also didn't buy her for a second as someone working on their doctorate. Still, the performances were generally good and I couldn't really find fault with anyone. What really saved the film for me from being just a run-of-the-mill ""cancer comedy"" (kind of odd to see those two words juxtaposed) were a couple of key scenes late in the movie which provided the emotional weight needed to anchor the film and provided a counter-balance to the crude humor that one would expect from a comedy starring Seth Rogen. But even though Seth Rogen is in the film, this is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's movie all the way and he does a great job of carrying it. Overall, I liked it a little more than I thought I might at first. The plot is rather predictable and cliché at times, but there was a lot of humor and heart that lifted it beyond other similar films."

And it's quite a good one too.<br/><br/>Cancer is affecting more and more people and the more the media can do to raise awareness is a good thing (my humble opinion). I watched Weeds (granted a comedy through and through) and a character got cancer in that and was basically better a few episodes later.<br/><br/>50/50 tries to show, as best a light-hearted film can, about how cancer can affect relationships. It's not totally dark and nasty, as many cancer sufferers can sadly relate to. It tries to appeal to a wider audience.<br/><br/>If you want something a bit serious, I'd recommend this (only the TV series Breaking Bad has dealt with cancer better in my opinion)."

","Inspired by a true story 50/50 takes us on the journey of Adam, your typical nice-guy who is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, that no one can pronounce. The movie takes on a light-hearted comedy vibe early, but later on the film takes a serious turn and we see how horrific the cancer is and how it is eating at Adam from the inside out.<br/><br/>Despite the story line early on being somewhat predictable and a pair of obvious product placements, 50/50 was an enormous success, definitely being one, if not the best comedy/drama movies ever seen. The incredible directing by Jonathan Levine, gets everything right, the unexpected diagnosis, the overbearing mother, the girlfriend that will not touch him, the unexpectedly not so self-centered best friend, the cute therapist, and of course the cancer ridden protagonist. From the on-point cinematography by Terry Stacey and the realistic, depressing, yet still comedic writing of Will Reiser, to the incredible acting performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick, both of whom never cease to amaze me. It is the perfect blend of comedy and drama, with a stone-cold message about friendship and illness, but still including the comic relief that makes life tolerable.<br/><br/>Typically I find that comedies, whether it be a TV show, a stand up comedian, or a movie are best enjoyed with friends. This movie however, exceeded my expectations and was definitely appreciated although I watched it alone, in my bedroom, on a Saturday night. This film definitely deserves much more recognition, as it is an unsung hero of the film word.<br/><br/>The very first thing I noticed about this film was that it was set in my hometown of Vancouver, B.C. and although it was meant to be set in Seattle, Washington I suppose we can let them go on this one. I am not however, letting them off the hook when Adam, during a nervous breakdown says ""I've never been to f****** Canada"", seriously... this was filmed in Vancouver, CANADA."

","Going into this film I saw that it had a really high rating on this website and I was worried if it could live up to the hype but boy does it ever. This film sees Andy a 27 year old and healthy who one day finds out he has cancer In his spine and his survival rate is 50/50. The story then documents how he and people around him react to this devastating news. Now I really do like Joseph gordon levitt as an actor and he owns this film with his wonderful performance that shows just how good he is. He shows just how a human being would act in his position and he goes through all the emotions and his performance drags you into this film. The supporting cast also do a good job with Seth rogen being the key one, he provides the main comedy in the film but there is also some heart in it plus he has good chemistry with levitt. Anna Kendrick plays his therapist and she does a good job too with her attitude being a big plus in andys life plus once again their chemistry was really good. Andy's girlfriend does a good job in the film and she does a good job in playing a 3 dimensional character and everybody else did a sound job too. The story is really good documenting the real way somebody in this situation would react and it documents the life of Andy perfectly. Their is a few clichés but you forget about them when the last 15 mins happens and all the emotions are pushed to the limit and it is fantastic. The script is great, all the dialogue is delivered well and it made the film feel as realistic as possible. The style is alright but sometimes the mix of comedy and drama didn't always work but for a lot of the time it did. Overall this is a fantastic film that I want my whole family to see."
"dewhurst-kyle","7","0","0","16 August 2014"," It wasn't all that original in style, sort of funny, and well put together.
","The movie starts you off showing the less glamorous mundane realities of the working life, and introduces the main characters, Gorden Levvit and Seth Rogan. It drops the news of the cancer, without any dramatic buildup, or transition at all, leaving an effect of suddenness which people inflicted must feel. Gordon Levitt, I thought was great throughout the movie, and his character kind of created a calm helplessness throughout the movie. It played heavily on his mom / girlfriend issues, while Seth Rogan bombarded the script with stoner humor and constant efforts to take him out and get him laid. I have never had cancer, or dealt with anyone that is going through cancer, but it seemed like Gordan Levitt rode that emotional roller-coaster white knuckled."

","Being a cancer victim doesn't always mean being completely weak and hopeless, it could mean enjoying life even more. Some could realize that life could be over shortly and that being happy and enjoying friendships should be taken advantage of. ""50/50"" shows the brutally realistic timeline of a cancer patient named Adam, a sweet, calm and unadventurous young man played spectacularly by the rising star Joseph-Gordon Levitt who's doctor tells his he has a 50/50 chance of surviving a rare type of cancer. Adam's outgoing and sometimes overly rude best friend Kyle tries and help Adam through his path of a rare cancer that could be fatal. Kyle is played hilariously by Seth Rogen who gives a comedic relief into this true story. The two end up making the best of Adam's situation and become closer in the process. Adam also gets another benefit from his caner, which is a relationship with his therapist Katherine, a sweet Anna Kendrick. ""50/50"" is so easy to admire because of how well Will Reiser balances his story between the genies comedy, to some of the most heartfelt sequences in cinematic history. We really see the transformation of Adam's relationships with his current girlfriend, Kyle, Katherine and his parents because of his cancer. It's interesting that many assume that all cancer patients are so unhappy, hopeless and miserable, because there are plenty of patients like Adam who look on the bright side of his situation and try and enjoy life with the people in his life. The whole theme of 50/50 is that no matter what situation your in, there is a way out of it and having hope can defeat anything your faced with. We get to see how the cancer affects Adam both physically and emotionally as well, still portraying what having cancer does to you. With a slick balance between comedy and drama, Jonathan Levine directs this film very nicely, using a very realistic view of the world, which helps show the realistic pint of view of someone with cancer, telling us that it isn't so miserable and you can still enjoy life. 50/50 is an ode to life about how some days your going to loose and some days you'll be triumphant. Like Adam, you could be hit with something that can alter your life drastically, but know there is always a way out of it. You owe it to yourself to see ""50/50"" so you can enjoy a great story that can warm and inspire you."

","A film that seems very true and honest to every circumstance that's going on within the film as well as all the emotions anyone would go through if one was afflicted with that unfortunate circumstance. I won't speak for people that have been afflicted with that unfortunate circumstance and who have beat it. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a great actor in the sense that he can switch it up real well playing the white trash guy, the hessian metalhead, or just your regular likable joe as he does in 500 Days of Summer and this film. He plays about half his roles like this film, so you would think you're just seeing Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing himself which is sort of the case, however he goes so deep within the circumstances that he's in, that no matter how similar the character may be from film to film, there is always a distinct difference in the character because again, he goes so deep within the circumstances of what is happening to that particular character he's playing. <br/><br/>That is very good acting. To be able to switch it up on one hand and play completely different characters like he did in Hesher, Looper, Don Jon and Killshot, but then at the same time to play similar type characters as he did in 500 Days of Summer and this film, and to still give that feeling that he's someone else in each of these films. He's an amazing actor. <br/><br/>And one has to love Seth Rogen, he's so funny. He always brings a different side of humanity to these types of films as he also did with Funny People. Rogen brings true sincere honesty and laughter in the worst of situations to where you don't see Rogen as being a person who lacks compassion, but as a person who has a lot of compassion to give in the only way he knows how to give it. Very good film all around, a good cry at times, and one to remember."

","50 50 2011<br/><br/>Inspired by writer Will Reiser's own experience with cancer, 50 50 stars the adorable Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He gives a heart wrenching, as well as warming, performance as Adam Lerner, a 27 year old journalist who is diagnosed with cancer.<br/><br/>Alongside Levitt, Seth Rogan gives an almost equally commendable performance through skilfully injecting humour into this sensitive story line. A particularly memorable example of this being when Lerner, worried about his chances of survival, confides in his friend, Kyle (Rogan) that the likelihood of him surviving cancer is 50/50. In response to this, Kyle shakes his head saying ""Oh God, I'm gonna be sick, I'm going to throw up"", his empathy and drama lifting the mood and providing light in this very dark story. This method of mixing a theme as serious as cancer with humour is done very intelligently; the film aptly tip toes along the line between appropriately hilarious and being rallied against.<br/><br/>Kyle is a very interesting character in 50 50 in the way that he seems to be, in ways, Adam's alter ego; it appears that Adam keeps burying his feelings about his disease and how the situation is affecting him but Kyle is an outward portrayal of what he is really thinking. An example of this would be the scene in which Lerner shaves his head. He is staring in the mirror holding the clippers and telling himself that it's going to look fine whilst Kyle, in the background of the shot, is shaking his head saying ""No it's not, no it's not. It's going to look weird."" This not only adds humour but provides the audience an insight into Adam's true feelings of the situation.<br/><br/>Adam shaving his head (Time 31:41) Moreover, Bryce Dallas Howard plays girlfriend and antagonist Rachael masterfully. The audience is able to not only recognise her as the film's ""baddie"" but also empathise with her and recognise that, despite how immoral her actions are, she believes she is also a victim; this expertly creates a three dimensional character whom we can both hate and understand. However, I cannot ignore that this is also due to a remarkable script writing on Reiser's part. Nevertheless I think that Howard is, without question, deserving of applause for her contribution.<br/><br/>A particularly moving scene in 50 50 is one in which Adam is in hospital and about to be wheeled off into the operating theatre and undergo life threatening surgery in order to overcome his cancer. There is an almost overwhelming degree of desperation to live that seeps from the screen and it, despite the cliché hand grasping, works beautifully.<br/><br/>Adam being taken to the operating theatre (Time 1:26:36) However, although this film seems initially without fault, after considering 50 50 further I came to realise the very strange way in which doctors are represented. Doctors are presented to the audience very negatively and without an obvious explanation as to why. An example of such negative representations would be the dizzy, unprofessional – in spite of her efforts - and under experienced psychiatrist, Katherine McKay (Anna Kendrick) that has been entrusted with this serious case. Her naïvity and youth exemplified through a reference to Doogie Howser and her confusion as to who/what that is and justification of asking, ""Does he work here?"" McKay progresses in the film to be a seminal character but is awarded such importance through such innocence and not via her skills as a psychiatrist. Another example of such representations would be when character Kyle goes as far as undermining a surgeon when she is telling him, and Lerner's mother, the result of Adam's surgery. In addition to this, the doctor who initially diagnoses Lerner's cancer is cold and distant when delivering the news and treats Adam as if he is a nuisance when he interrupts him making notes on this unique case. This coldness could be interpreted as exaggerating the protagonist's personality as polite and innocent with a juxtaposing character, however it just further reinforces the idea that doctors, or those in the medical industry, do not care.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the fore mentioned scene, in which Lerner is diagnosed, is brilliantly shot. As he receives the news and the word ""cancer"" is uttered the audience hears nothing further than white noise. The screen fills with disjointed close ups and mid shots, illustrating that Adam is no longer concentrating on what the doctor is saying and is deafened by the weight of the word.<br/><br/>The film creates what seems to be an insight into an alternative view of the experience of being diagnosed with cancer. It provides us with a 27 year old man who, as well as deserving sympathy, still uses his illness to get girls, uses his friend's pubic hair trimmers to shave his head and, along with the other cancer patients, eats macaroons laced with marijuana when being treated with chemotherapy. 50 50 presents the audience with a cancer sufferer who is uncomfortable with sympathy and wishes people would be honest with him and isn't allowing the disease to become part of his identity or reflect how people interact with him. This alternative view, that alleviates the weight of the topic with wittiness and hilarity, makes 50 50 a refreshingly honest film.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://sophiesum.wordpress.com/"

I understood that if something happens to you ( like this one ) you can assure that your girlfriend would not be with you anymore except your buddy :) . But of course although I said it was good but I didn't like this movie much. Because you see that a man's story about the cancer, but there was not really action.

","I think this movie bases on the hope,facing with the cancer and the secret love. These all things are well-developed in the movie. I got the know Joseph Leonard Gordon-Levitt in the ""Inception"" which makes me admirer of him. As if he was born an actor. He is definitely capable of doing this. In this movie he looks like a prim and meticulous. He has a bro who is fond of girls and his bro is really cheerful. But when he learns that he is a cancer, he is shocked and starts to search how much he has chance to get over this sick. His bro says that everything will be okay. He tries to feel him comfortable. His bro gives a party to celebrate Adam's life. Then, Adam starts to receive chemotherapy from a lady who is doing her postgraduate. Not to remember, Adam has a girlfriend who does not love him and has a mother who is so anxious. His girlfriend cheats him and they break up,of course. Over time,the therapy does not work and the operation is needed. In the meantime operation is over and he will be got better in time.

","I think this movie deserves the point that was given. Generally I watch science fiction or action movies but I do love this film. As far as I know, this film is inspired by a true story. This is mainly about life of a man (Adam) He is diagnosed with spinal cancer and tries to come over this cancer. I thought the end of this movie can be predicted easily but this is not happening. A lot of things that you cannot imagine are happening. For example Adam's girlfriend cheated and left him, but Kyle who was his best friend never leaves him alone and also Adam's mother did. Adam fell in love with his therapist and much more. You can find many things from your life in this movie. As a person who likes science fiction and action movies. I am suggesting that movie.

","50/50 was considered one of the best films of 2012, a comedy-drama tackling the serious subject of cancer. It would have easy for the film to fall into melodrama, sentimentality and being very much like a TV movie, but 50/50 was blessed with an excellent screenplay and a top cast.<br/><br/>Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a 27-year-old radio journalist for Seattle Public Radio and man who is have problems with his girlfriend, Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard). When he experiences back problem Adam goes to the doctors and it turns out he has schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma, a rare type of spiral cancer. It turns out he has a 50% chance of surviving. As Adam undergoes chemotherapy it effects relationship with his guilt ridden girlfriend, his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) who sees the cancer as a great way to get with girls, his therapist, Katherine (Anna Kendrick), his friendships with two other cancer patients and overbearing mother (Anjelica Huston).<br/><br/>Will Reiser provided an excellent screenplay, a character driven story that is both dramatic and when it comic, genuinely very funny. There is funny dialogue and interactions between the characters and most of the cast has a moment to shine. But the comedy never distract from the drama and the characters. The characters were well written and reacted and acted believably, from characters using any old wives tale they believe to help Adam, people being sympathetic but unsure how to react when they hear the news, to Kendrick's character keeping referring to her university instead of her knowledge and experience.<br/><br/>There is a great cast in 50/50 and there all play well defied characters. Gordon-Levitt has emerged as a great talent and shows his range with 50/50: Adam starts of as a mild manner, rather meek person who becomes more daring, outgoing and confidence after his diagnosis. Katherine's character serves as a way to deconstruct the psychological symptoms he is suffering and because of her recent studies sounds a bit more natural for her to speak like that a seasoned veteran.<br/><br/>Whilst the main narrative is about Adam's cancer and the way it affects him and those close to him, but there are other parts of the story that should draw people in. There is the relationship between Adam and Rachael as Rachael feels compelled to be with Adam and his realisation that she is bad for him, the friendship Adam and Kyle, Adam's relationship with his mother in the third act and his blurring friendship with Katherine.<br/><br/>Director Jonathan Levine does inject an indie-film vide to the 50/50, using indie music and musical montages, some visual tricks, for example after Adam gets high and when Adam and Kyle destroy a painting. Levine kept a very fast pace throughout and whilst the film does lean towards the drama, 50/50 is not hammed fisted and the comedy elements worked nicely. With the musical cues 50/50 has a slightly similar feel to 500 Days of Summer and continuing both films have a theme of women who are bad for their partners they work well together as companions pieces to each other.<br/><br/>Considering the subject matter, 50/50 is an entertaining film and I can picture myself watching it again."

The players are very successful, too. They role as it is real. It is a good performance."

Preparation of Adam for the surgery... Hug his mother and cry with a little child's innocence ...I could not prevent my tears in this scene.<br/><br/>Your body has a small tumor in a place,it is damaging to your life,your memories,your family...<br/><br/>This film is one of the rare films explaining fact of cancer with the most impressive way.The movie showed that with an inspirational way, people shouldn't surrendered the cancer easily.Players also reflected this feeling in a realistic way.In short, I liked the movie and I was very impressed...<br/><br/>P.S.: I watched the film with my family and they also liked it :)"

","The film is a comedy-drama. This film,we can see the balance between comedy and drama. The main actor in the film is a 27 years old man called Adam. Adam Larner,a young man who finds out that he has cancer. He feels in complex emotions due to cancer. After he gets cancer,he becomes so thin and faint. He loses interest in life and loses his confidence gradually. This movie adapted from reality. The name of the film is fairly considerable. Because, a very difficult situation in which there will be a 50/50 chance to survive. The actor and actresses are high qualified. I think, performers are very good with acting their roles. Adam's friend Kyle constantly tries to make Adam secure and happy. Adam's therapist Anna Kendrick, plays her supporting role admirably. With the help of his best friend Kyle and his young therapist Kendrick, he struggle to beat cancer. This is great story of human emotion and friendship. I was definitely expecting a sad ending from the director, but there is a good ending in the movie.<br/><br/>I like very much this movie. If you want to watch drama, I advise this film. I think,everybody should watch it! It is certainly worth seeing."

","Filled with a good sense of tumor!! That was bad, too corny. But thankfully the movie isn't. I've always felt a great sense of connection with Joseph Gordon-Lewitt's character in 500 Days of Summer and it extends to this movie too. A little disappointment is Seth Rogen's character that intrudes and demands attention but has nothing entertaining to say.<br/><br/>Adam (Lewitt) is highly health conscious and practical. He is in a deteriorating relationship on denial mode. But a bigger jolt tumbles his world when he realizes he has a rare form of cancer and his chances are 50/50. This affects his practical nature too paving way for irrationality. Shuns his worried mother, dumps his caring girlfriend Rachel (Dallas Howard) who was intending to breakup just before he got sick but sticks around when she finds out, suspects his insensitive buddy Kyle (Rogen) of being selfish when he is trying to cheer him up. Finally he finds solace from his shrink Katie (Kendrick) who just started practicing - starting from him. He can't accept his fate but puts a brave face.<br/><br/>After showering enough praise on Lewitt, another star of the show is Anna Kendrick. I was a little skeptical when she was awarded an academy nomination for 'Up in the Air' but realized her potential for little nuances only here. There are few characters and they are realistic and well developed except for Seth Rogen's, where he is Seth Rogen. Screenplay never lags - all packaged in a noteworthy soundtrack. The only misfire is its incapability to leverage on the suspense factor highlighted by the movie title.<br/><br/>It is a see-saw ride with moments of emotional introspect mixed with crude insensitive humor. Watch it for Lewitt and Kendrick."

","The problem with this film is that it starts quite badly. The comedy is a little mis-firing and I felt the tone was a bit off. I liked the run up to the main story but it sometimes felt a little forced and just..off.<br/><br/>BUT, once the film gets into it's stride it is marvelous. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gets better and better as the film progresses and what starts off as a somewhat awkward performance grows into a rather fine portrayal of a young man dealing with life threatening illness. Anna Kendrick puts in an excellent turn as a bumbling trainee counselor and helps to push the film to a satisfying conclusion. Seth Rogan is...Seth Rogan, as ever and he provides light - if somewhat crude - relief from the subject matter. But he seriously needs to expand his acting repertoire.<br/><br/>This is a well made and quite emotional film. I lost both my parents to cancer and could relate to a lot of the scenes and sentiments portrayed. The only thing I still don't get is when portraying cancer patients undergoing chemo why they don't get rid of the eyebrows? Chemo tends to not be selective!<br/><br/>Overall a great film that is worth watching."

","This is a sensitive and delightful portrayal of a young man's fight against the big C, Cancer. Gordon-Levitt has back problem and he finds out that he has cancerous growth in his spinal cord. Rogen is his close friend who helps him in these trying times. However, he also uses him for getting laid himself. Anna Kendrick is the psychotherapist who counsels Levitt and slowly begins falling for him. Philip Baker Hall is an old cancer patient whom Levitt meets in the hospital. Angelica Houston plays his mother who has her hands full what with a husband who is suffering from Alzheimer's and a son recently diagnosed with cancer. The acting is great all round with Levitt and Rogen outperforming every one else due to their great chemistry and fantastic characters. Rogen gets to mouth some very hilarious lines. The direction is very balanced and Levine never makes this an over the top sentimental affair. The travails of a person who has just learnt he has cancer are shown in a realistic manner.I liked it quite a bit. In Hindi movies, the cancer patient is shown as a hero who is running around, uniting lovers and shaking his ass at weddings. Wish the Hindi film makers could learn something from a movie like this. 3.5 out of 5 for 50/50."

","A dramedy about cancer is a proper hard-sell in the market, this wee budget film (although JGL and Seth Rogan are quite bankable names among their peers) has done a quite solid battle in the box-office last year (domestic total gross is $35 million against its $8 million budget), due to its very heartfelt closeness and touchingness of its concoction of the three- faceted narrative (love, friendship and family) revolving around our young protagonist who has been through an ordeal of a very rare spine cancer. <br/><br/>Adopted from a true event of the screenwriter Will Reiser (who is a close friend of Rogen and takes on an ephemeral cameo too), the film has a rare pluck and daintiness in reciting the story from a very earthly perspective, no flamboyant hyperbole, the plot goes through a carefully measured but innately captivating melodrama (although the big question of the survival of the operation had never been doubted, the bare truth is the screenwriter himself is still alive!), it could be reckoned as a sequel of (500) DAYS OF SUMMER (2009, 8/10), JGL continues to generate his congenial drawing power through the rough road of a young man's battle with the malignant tumour, most of the time, he exercises a pleasingly lifelike mechanism to embody himself to his character without showing off the edginess and dominance which could be easily sensed. Seth Rogen mainly serves as a crude but kind- hearted friend (still too coarse with his sex-oriented jokes). Anna Kendrick is another mainstay of the film, utterly adorable and convincing as the rookie shrink, slightly uptight but accurately vivid (she is among my top 5 list of best supporting actress and JGL is inside my top 10 list of best leading actor). Ms. Howard again (after THE HELP, 2011, 8/10) finds herself in a very dislikable role, hope her career path will not be pigeonholed into the ""bitch"" category; Anjelica Huston, this time is quite far from her usual majesty, instead renders her prowess to manage a less glamorous presentation of a nagging but loving mother. <br/><br/>Director Jonathan Levine's next film is the new TWILIGHT wannabe WARM BODIES (2013), one should feel confident that at least it will catch up with the closeness and touchingness in spite of over-exploiting the (vampire) zombie-cum-romance territory."

","50/50 is beautifully written (true-story inspired) comedy-drama about a 27-year old writer and his friend, whose lives get affected when the former is diagnosed with spinal cancer. It's a story about love, friendship, endurance, survival and finding humour in the most unlikely places. It's at times like these, you know the people who you can actually depend on.<br/><br/>The movie is mainly carried forward by the two brilliant leads, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who takes care of the drama, and Seth Rogen, who takes care of the comic relief. Anna Kendrick plays her supporting role admirably.<br/><br/>I've followed Gordon-Levitt's movies since a long time. He has matured so wonderfully as an actor, and most of the movies he's chosen in his career are quite honest, original and of human interest.

","The prospect of contracting a terrible disease like cancer is something one rarely associates with young people. Which is the basis of a different look at Adam, a rising star in radio. To his surprise, Adam receives the news from a doctor who shows no empathy at all for telling his patient the seriousness of his condition.<br/><br/>Adam, who has been living with Rachael, is afraid of her reaction. He need not worry about it because she is the kind who promises she will stay by him, then goes on to cheat on Adam. His best friend, Kyle, is another story, he really cares about Adam and what he will be facing down the road. Kyle sticks to Adam throughout, as a real friend would do, no questions asks.<br/><br/>To complicate things, Adam's own mother, Diane, has a full plate taking care of her husband Richard, suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Adam finds a sympathetic person in the person of Katherine, a therapist working with him in dealing with his cancer. The two form a bond that will sustain him throughout the worst moments he must face.<br/><br/>A well meant film directed by Jonathan Levine and written by Will Reiser's whose experience battling the disease is the basis of the fine screenplay he created. The filmmakers did a credible work in presenting a story that feels plausible. They present the story the way Mr. Reiser probably experienced it himself. Being a survivor, his friendship with the actor Seth Rogen plays well in the finished product.<br/><br/>No one could have asked for anyone better than Joseph Gordon-Levitt to play Adam. This actor always delivers in whatever vehicle he decides to get involved with. Seth Rogen makes a good Kyle, without going overboard. Anna Kendrick has some fine moments in the film as Katherine, the therapist. Bryce Dallas Howard is seen as Rachael and a fine Anjelica Huston plays Adam's mother."

","I was amazed by this movie. I mean Joseph Gordon-Levitt always plays such dull boring characters and Seth Rogan can only play one character. Strangely they both play their usual roles and yet, it works in this movie.<br/><br/>So Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds out he has cancer. A fairly rare case in which there will be a 50/50 chance to survive. In this movie we get to see him cope with the issue, and come to terms with the possibility of his death as does his best friend (Seth Rogan), his family, his girlfriend, and his new, inexperienced, young, attractive, therapist (Anna Kendrick).<br/><br/>What I loved about this one was that it was not a sad story. Even in the worst of times this movie takes a humorous approach that works well, and not in too much of a way that makes you not take it seriously. We saw Seth Rogan in this kind of movie with Adam Sandler(Funny People) and it was a miserable FAIL. I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt's sort of straight man, dull quality is what really made this one different.<br/><br/>Seth Rogan was OK, he always does a good job with his characters but then again he only plays that one stoner who never grew up, which, let's face it, its him. I think Anna Kendrick played her inexperienced psychologist role pretty well, I have seen her in plenty of other films, but she had never really had a stand out character and this was one where she did well.<br/><br/>This movie is a not a comedy, yet has enough comedy in it that its very hard to call it drama as well.I really didn't want to see this one and did it begrudgingly. I am glad I did it was well worth it. Even if you don't like weepy sad stories that make you think about mortality, or illness, which I am usually not a fan either, this one is good enough to keep you laughing and not feel to terrible bad afterwards. <br/><br/>Like my reviews, hate em?

","50/50 falls very neatly into the very definition of ""dramedy"" - as the title suggests, it's a 50/50 split between the two. That's not to say that it isn't, in its heart, very much a drama; the poster and tagline that suggest a buddy comedy starring Seth Rogen should not be trusted. But it refuses to ever delve into kitsch or soap-operatic melodrama; it tackles a difficult subject with maturity, subtlety and yes, a sense of humor. It's lighthearted, but never tasteless. And it's this combination that makes it so realistic, so lovable and so easy to relate to. It's never too depressing or bleak, but it's also not unrealistically optimistic; and being a positive, honest film about terminal disease, it feels very refreshing indeed.<br/><br/>Cinematically there's nothing very special about it. The editing and cinematography are actually very good; but just in a way that makes the film easy on the eyes and easy to connect to. Just like Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance, which is naturalistic and very strong but also subtle and quiet - which is maybe why he was snubbed so badly during award season. The supporting cast, too, are all deserving of praise - Seth Rogen (clowning around as always, but also a surprisingly realistic and compelling character), Anjelica Huston, Serge Houde, Bryce Dallas Howard, Anna Kendrick, Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer all deliver beautifully - but all their performances are toned down, they don't deliver any poignant monologues or soliloquies. They're all just believable and real human beings with flaws as well as virtues.<br/><br/>All this makes 50/50 a film that may not leave a striking impression, but will stay with you in its spirit and its humanity - which may just be the point. It doesn't strive to be a great film, just a very good one, that diffuses some of the melodrama usually affiliated with a subject like cancer, and presents it much closer to what it would play like in reality - a part of life, one that hopefully one wouldn't have to experience, but a part of it nonetheless. It won't make any top 50 lists, nor should it, but it should be watched by everyone."

","When I first read about this film, I didn't think it could work. But when a friend recommended it, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad that I did and that is mainly because of Gordon-Levitt (who plays Adam). The way he deals with fear of dying/despair and at the same time with his friends and family is very convincing. I think the most moving scene is at the end, right before his surgery, reaching out for his mother and not wanting to let go... Anjelica Huston as his overbearing mom is fantastic and I was glad when they finally started talking. What makes this movie so outstanding is that it isn't only sad, it is funny too (very difficult to get the balance right when you are dealing with such a difficult topic) and that is not due to Seth Rogen, who is most of the time annoying and obnoxious and far from funny. It's again Gordon - Levitt who comes across as such a lovely, likable, easygoing guy whose regret is not having traveled to Canada and never having said I love you to a woman, who on his early morning run waits until the traffic light turns green even though there is no traffic and no one on the street, who keeps an old retired race dog and who puts up with his best friend using him / his disease to chat up women. Comic relief comes partly also from Adam's new friends Alan and Mitch and their 'medicinal marijuana tea time'. Why this movie is not a 10? 1) Seth Rogen: he's too annoying and immature 2) The girlfriend: she's too one dimensional 3) The relationship with his mother: the moment when he needed and accepted her comfort was the most powerful scene in the film and there should have been more emphasis on the development of this relationship (rather than focusing on Seth Rogen and his adolescent antics) Despite the criticism this movie is worth watching! I wish there were more movies like this one!"

","50/50 is a film about a man's battle with cancer and the way his relationships unfold during the battle. It is loosely based on the experiences of Will Reiser who is the writer of the film.<br/><br/>The film is about a radio journalist Adam Lerner (Gordon-Levitt) who is having problems with his back for a while. Later, when he goes to the hospital for a check up, he finds that he is suffering from a rare form of cancer which is eating away his bones & tissues. He checks on the internet and finds that his odds of surviving stands at 50/50. On hearing about his cancer, his best friend & co-worker Kyle (Seth Rogen) tries to make him as normal as possible. He is relieved by the fact that he still has 50% chance of survival. Adam's girl friend cheats on him and he breaks up with her. He starts getting close with his therapist McKay (Kendrick) and fellow cancer patients while he is undergoing Chemotherapy. After sometime it is discovered that his cancer is not responding to the chemotherapy and he'll have to undergo a surgery in order to remove the tumour. However, the success of the surgery is slim. Also, one of the cancer patients with whom he was close dies and the thought finally dawns on him as to how close he was to death. Will he be able to defeat the cancer?<br/><br/>The small highlight of the movie above would make you think that this movie is some serious stuff which is not entirely true. Though the movie deals with an issue as serious as cancer, it does so with a human face. It is laced with traces of comedy. When you have a guy like Seth Rogen in a movie the least you can expect is some humour and he delivers it with finesse. 50/50's perfect blend of comedy & drama is what it is worth watching for together with the excellent performances by the characters. Joseph Gordon-Levitt pulls off an excellent performance as a cancer patient. It is the only movie I've seen of him apart from his role in Inception. I liked the way the background music blended with the emotions of the film. It made sure the main theme of the movie remained intact.<br/><br/>50/50 is a perfect blend of serious drama and crude humour surrounding a man's battle with cancer. One of its kind movie. Go for it!"

","The film's only real weakness can be found in the girlfriend and mother characters. Howard and Huston give the roles their best efforts, but both of them are stuck with stereotypical and predictable character arcs. We know exactly how each of them will behave from the moment we meet them, and they offer little to the overall experience.50/50 was inspired by Reiser's own experiences with cancer in his mid twenties, and if there's a message to the movie it's that laughter really is the best medicine. Clichéd? Sure, but that doesn't make it any less true. Finding the humor in any situation is an often overlooked key to survival, and while the film never shies away from the pain, suffering, and depression associated with an experience like this, it stays true to its core belief. The people who make you laugh, in good times and bad, are the people you want and need to keep close."

His life takes a sudden and dramatic turn when he learns his illness. As he tries to understand his problem, he meets a beautiful therapist who is very helpful about his illness. Before long, Adam's complex relationship with his girlfriend makes him dump her, and his closest friend and mother support him about it. As the severity of his condition increases, Adam begins to reassess his life, his relationships and then in the cure, he likes his therapist and they start new life. In brief, it is a good movie, it can make you laugh or cry, but I recommend you to watch it."

","50/50 FIFTY FIFTY<br/><br/>The film 50/50 is a kind of comedy, drama and romantic. Because the film reflects a real life story which is a cancer man's life, you are engrossed in the film. You feel same things with him and place yourself in his position during the film, so this makes the film more attractive and gripping. Although nobody wants an illness which is nearly incurable like this, real stories mostly attract attention of the spectators, you know. Besides, in spite of touching, it has funny scenes. I mean, while watching this film, you sometimes feel sad whereas you sometimes smile. Because one of the man's friends tries to make the man happy. So, he performs enjoyable actions and this presents funny scenes. Actually, I think that the film shows the cancer superficially in spite of being a real life. You watch the friendship, fondness and surviving effort like a humor by this film.When you watch it, you really understand the meaning of moment and life. And you know the value of your health. Shortly, it is a nice film but the man's position is totally a misery. The film teaches how beautiful life is. So, it is worth to watch."

","Movies about illness are expected to be sentimental and dramatic. But the director Jonathan Levine blended this true story with comedy aspect and turned it to a movie. The main character Adam suffers from backache and goes to doctor. Then he learns that he has a cancer which is a rare one.Basically,movie centered about Adam's struggle with cancer, relationship with his friend and family. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levit, who plays the role of Adam,generally act coolheaded,ordinary people who leads a plain life.Adam's kinda resembles Levit's Tom character in 500 Days of Summer. These two kind of characters are cut out for Levit,and he make the best of it.In addition to that Seth Rogen ,who plays Kyle,performs outstanding in the movie as Adam's best friend.He adds humor to movie with his character,and he well to his role.Also director Jonathan Levine made the right choice to choose this cast.Except from Levit and Rogen,movie has well known actresses and actors such as Bryce Dallas Howard,Anjelica Huston,Anna Kendrick,Serge Houde,Andrew Airlie and so on.<br/><br/>All in all,you can get carried away with this movie and empathize with Adam.So do not except a plain movie about an illness just sit back and watch it."

","It has been one of the most thought-provoking films which I have watched lately. I found the film emotional, entertaining, enjoyable and challenging. In my opinion, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is immensely prosperous. There has been a 27-year-old public radio journalist who has cancer. When he learned this disease, he was at a loss. It sounds fearful because he is a young man, there should be long years to live; however he was caught a bad disease. This matter also makes me think about some of these questions: Why am I the person who had cancer? , How much time left? , Would I die? On the other hand, I found the film a little bit of superficial because the disease has not been discussed thoroughly and the film reminds me love story film. At any rate, I think one and all should watch this film just because ""50/50"" reminds how substantial our life and our health. If we lose sense of well-being, we are not able to cope up with life, and this film aims to recite this truth. After a while his girl friend starts to cheat him. His bosom buddy reveals this fact. That is another rueful event while striving with disease. This scene also purposes to tell that in the hardest times we realize people's real intent."

We always hear that, 'he/she broken up girlfriend/boyfriend because he/she was dog sick' and this film showing the truth of that expression. Actually, I am thinking about, if I were a dog sick boy's girlfriend what could I do? But I am sure that I never broken up him, at least he was dog sick or on the ground that his sickness.

Because, sickness person is in need of assistance from the other persons. The woman, who is girlfriend's of the sickness man, firstly cheated the man later said that to the man ' I felt very bad and I was hopeless what could I do?' .Simply, I can say –it is only my mind-, she can support him to recover from an illness.

I mean, the process of the getting over the cancer became abrupt. But it does not mean that this film can not be watched and I just want to determine simple scenes.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is very excellent and impressive and situation of man is miserable which made me upset while watching it.<br/><br/>The character Katherine contributes on extra value to the film. Eventually,there is someone who is eager to help to Adam but for Adam's family. Therefore, I think, she played an important role in the film. I understand from the film that family is indispensable part of the people. Adam's boyfriend is just thinking of making love with girls rather than thinking of Adam I guess. Also his girlfriend takes him for a ride and it is very bad situation for someone being cancer.

At the same time, his father is Alzheimer and when he tells them his illness, his mother becomes very upset but his father becomes happy or sad. Film continues slowly but I do not bored it.

"ScarletAnna","7","0","0","16 May 2012"," Unconventional cancer movie hit and miss, with potential
","Extremely likable actors and an unconventional take on the tropes of cancer movies do not save this film from being uneven. This is described as a comedy, but there is very little space for laughs. It convincingly conveys how shocking, scary and personal being diagnosed with cancer is, and does not coat it with sugary or over-dramatic writing. Yet, the chore of the film is the friendship between Adam and Kyle (Seth Rogen's character), as much as how Adam faces his condition. While the scenes between the two main actors feel fresh and original, though slightly too crude at times, the rest of the action is rushed. The other characters are mostly just sketches, if not stereotypes. The depiction of the doctors, including Anna Kendrick's inexcusably unprofessional therapist, is almost offensive. Anjelica Huston's role is minimal. One would expect, at least, a couple more mother-son exchanges, especially during Adam's treatment. Poor Bryce Dallas Howard has the worst of possible parts, and makes the best of it, but once again she gets very little screen time. It is significant that the main scenes in which the supporting cast has a chance to shine, are those in which Rogen is not present: at the dinner in which Adam announces he has cancer to his mother and father, or during the chemotherapy. Rogen and Gordon-Levitt work well together, particularly when left to concentrate on the bond between their characters, as in the improvised shaving scene or in the destruction of Adam's ex-girlfriend's painting, which achieves the combined effect of offering comic relief and being tinged with misogyny. The photography by Terry Stacey is aptly soberly consistently realistic, as one would expect in a movie with this budget. The only concession to colour is the scene in which Adam walks back from chemotherapy stoned, after eating the marijuana filled biscuits, offered by his fellow patients. The music is also sparingly used, I particularly appreciated hearing Radiohead's ""High and Dry"" right after Adam receives his diagnosis and Pearl Jam's ""Yellow Leadbetter"" at the end. This is a good little film, It has the potential to become a classic. It bravely takes on a difficult subject, avoiding being saccharine-filled. It also steers clear of lecturing. The vulgarity in it, the moments in which the characters appear limited or faulty, is arguably its best quality. It rings very close to reality, in a sober, quiet way, non-judgemental way."

The things that saved the picture are the performance of Joseph Gordon Levitt and the form the film shows the way of living a life with cancer. This is remarkable because is extremely realistic; in other words, the things that Adam start doing when the doctor diagnosed him cancer are the same that everyone would probably do. You wont get out of the hospital planning to take what remains of life; you will denied that you are fine, get angry with the world, you will discovered who your true friends are and refuge in what you find first.

","""50/50"" was marketed as a buddy movie, but those going into it with that expectation are bound to be disappointed.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen does play best friend to Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a young man who's diagnosed with a rare and vicious type of cancer, but he has relatively little screen time and the film isn't about their relationship. Rather, it's about Gordon-Levitt's life and attitudes in general post-diagnosis, and the effect the possibility of his impending mortality has on his love life, relationship with his mother (Anjelica Huston), etc. I'm actually glad it steered clear of many of the ""young-person-dying"" clichés that can make movies like this so dreary. But it's not an entirely successful movie either, aiming for a black comedy that the screenplay doesn't pull off. In fact, the writing is the film's biggest problem; too many scenes feel too implausible, and while I don't necessarily relish wallowing in grimness for grimness' sake, the ending felt entirely too happy and pat to be believable.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie has some strong things to recommend it, notably the performances of Gordon-Levitt, one of the most talented and underrated young actors currently working, and Anna Kendrick, who delivers a sparkling turn as Gordon-Levitt's therapist.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","A complex ball of emotion that fits snugly into the confused mental state of a fresh cancer diagnosee and his confidants. It's an unusual setting for a comedy, which leads to a few situations where it feels like we should ask permission to laugh, but that plays into the central theme that there's no right or wrong way to deal with something so complicated. It's not wall-to-wall laughs, either, which would give the impression that it's taking the subject too lightly. Seth Rogan plays his typical role excellently, the wise-cracking frat boy facsimile everybody seems to know, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt balances him out with a harsh dose of sarcasm cut with grim reality. It's sneakily effective about investing us in the cast, and by the time the end rolls around they're almost family. A bit formulaic and weepy at times, neither are quite excessive enough to incite accusations of being a closet chick flick, and it's often ready with a firm punchline just when it's needed."

"Will_Malone","8","0","0","29 April 2012"," Laughter is the best medicine.
","A comedy about cancer? That can't be right. Surely cancer is about as serious as it gets. The simple mention of the C-word normally fills people with dread; no one really knows how to react to it or what to say when they meet real life sufferers. However the one thing that has been clear to date is that people know not to laugh at it. That is until now.<br/><br/>50/50 is a semi-biographical comedy/drama penned by Will Resier, based on his own personal battle against cancer. It is the sort of script that you feel could only have been written by someone who has been there themselves and boy does it show. In a film with subject matter as dark as this, delivering the right tone is essential. Too dark and you lose the film, too light and you lose the audience sympathies. It is with this in mind that Resier's script is something of a masterpiece. The tone is perfectly judged, delivering moments of genuine emotional turmoil, punctuated with relief bringing humour delivered via snappily written dialogue. This is perfectly highlighted in the moments that Adam is told he has cancer - 'I have cancer? I don't drink, I don't smoke, I exercise....I recycle....'. The whole tone of the film just feels real. You can imagine this is very close to how it was.<br/><br/>The story begins with Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), as a healthy 27 year old working in a local radio station alongside best mate Kyle (Seth Rogan). After a period of back pain, Adam consults his doctor who after an MRI scan, diagnoses Adam with a rare form of spinal cancer with a survival rate of 50%. Supported (to various degrees) by his best mate(Rogan), girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas-Howard) and mother (Anjelica Huston), Adam embarks on a period of chemo and mental therapy, the latter delivered by the newly qualified Dr Katie (Anna Kendrick), in a bid to beat the cancer.<br/><br/>Right from the off it is worth saying that this is Joseph Gorden-Levitt's film. Levitt as Adam delivers another hugely impressive performance, and one that had me fully engaged and rooting for him from the opening scene. He plays Adam with sensitivity and honesty, and you genuinely feel for him throughout the film. Adam is the perfect counter-balance to Seth Rogan's Kyle, whose idea of support appears to be predominately based on taking advantage of the situation to elicit Adam (and indeed himself) as much sympathy sex as possible. This brings some amusing moments, but it is later in the film as Kyle struggles to deal with the emotional aspects of the situation that Rogan really shines. Subsequent to watching the film I discovered the close friendship and history between the script writer Reiser and Rogan. This is quite astonishing and puts Rogan's performance firmly into perspective; he may well not have been acting at all.<br/><br/>As Adam embarks on breaking the news to those close to him and indeed work colleagues (including the strangest work party I have ever seen), rather than gathering the required support base for Adam, you get the strong feeling that it is Adam who is leading everyone through this process; a bit like a support group but in reverse. Everyone struggles in situations like this and it is painful watching his relationships with his best friend, girlfriend and parents slowly unravel under the weight of uncertainty. At times Adam appears extremely lonely, and never forget lonely with a potentially fatal disease; this is heartbreaking to watch. Thankfully Adam finds solace in his newly familiar medical surroundings through fellow chemotherapy patients (played wonderfully by Philip Baker-Hall + Matt Frewer) and his therapist Dr Katie (Kendrick).<br/><br/>It is with these two new groups that Adam begins to understand and importantly accept what is happening to him. Kendrick delivers another top class performance as Dr Katie, who as a newly qualified therapist with Adam as only her 3rd patient, is clearly still learning the ropes. The chemistry between the two of them is wonderfully awkward at times, but also very genuine. They are both new at this, but somehow Katie is able to lead Adam through his emotional roller-coaster so helping him concentrate on what is important. It is with this in mind, that one of the most powerful scenes in the film is between Adam and his mum. This genuinely emotional scene beautifully portrays the importance of the mother child relationship. It had me in floods of tears and I suspect I am not alone here.<br/><br/>50/50 is a remarkably well judged, uplifting and strangely amusing film of which all involved should take a well deserved bow. It deals with a difficult subject matter sensitively, respectively but also I suspect from reading some other reactions to the film, very genuinely. It challenges the way we should look at difficult situations and importantly how we react to them, and with the people involved. Whilst I was initially concerned it would be a tough watch, it was one of the most genuine comedies that I have seen for some time. Highly recommended."

","Mixing comedy and drama isn't an easy thing to do. Sometimes it works, but a lot of times it doesn't. It gets even more difficult when you're joking about things you're not supposed to joke about. In 50/50, Seth Rogan is the best friend/comic relief and while he's hilarious as always, it doesn't really fit with the tone of the film. For the most part, 50/50 is an inspiring story about a young man fighting for his life. While the writer tries to use comedy to lighten the mood, I felt that all it did was distract me from the story and bring the quality of the picture down. As always, Joseph Gordon-Levitt was absolutely incredible and continues to be the most talented and underrated actor in all of Hollywood, but I guess that's what happens when you get your start on an overrated sitcom. Those looking for another hysterical Rogan/Pot inspired comedy will be disappointed by this film, and those looking for a touching drama, may also be disappointed by the inappropriateness of it all. I liked the film a lot, even though it tries to blend two things into one, rather unsuccessfully. Simply put JGL makes this film, Rogan doesn't fit, and there's only about a 50/50 chance you're going to enjoy it."

","This movie really surprised me, I did not expect much because I did not see any trailer or ads for this movie before I started watching it but I got a really great experience. Surprisingly Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Seth Rogen had a really good chemistry going on, and the movie crosses a really tragic subject together with some great humor, so it got a bit emotional at times.<br/><br/>I'm set to believe that Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been a 'diamond in the rough' and he has really begun to shine as an actor these last few years. He's come a long way since '3rd Rock from the Sun'. I'm also grown real fond of Seth Rogen, he's really different and charming in a way.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely one to watch if you're in need to get some cheering up on a rainy day."

","Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is 27 years old, has a loving girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), works as a writer for a local radio station and is a genuine nice guy. Life is good, until he learns that he has a rare case of spinal cancer, leaving him with a 50% chance to survive it. With the help of his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), his overprotective mother (Anjelica Huston) and the young postgraduate therapist Katherine (Anna Kendrick), he tries to tackle chemotherapy. Everyone has their own way to handle Adam and his disease, but is there really a way to help him as the cancer starts to take its tolls?<br/><br/>This movie is inspired by a true story, the story of the writer Will Reiser, and Seth Rogen was really his friend in those hard times in real life. Now, combining drama and comedy is something difficult to do, but the director Jonathan Levine and writer Will Reiser manage to keep it at a good balance, at 50/50 if you like, without melodramatising it or turning it into a laughing stock. The story may pick up slow, but gets really good, revealing the difficulties Adam has to face and the friendship he receives. What I also like about the movie is the lack of romance. Sure, there is this thing going on, but it's really subtle and the movie would be about the same without it. They are not ruining the touching plot with a cheesy love story. On the story downside, there are a few things that seem neglected, like Adam's job or his old greyhound Skeletor. They are not important for the story, but the way they are introduced and sometimes mentioned, you get the feeling that there should be more to it. Levitt's acting is really good and you can feel all the different moods and stages his character goes through. And I'm really surprised, that Rogen cannot only play the funny parts, but the serious ones as well. It's also mainly thanks to his contribution, that the movie avoids drifting into a depressing one and can keep its drama/comedy balance. The characters are likable and generally played well. Overall quite a good movie to recommend. So, unless you prefer mindless action flicks or stupid comedies, go see this one, I enjoyed it."

This movie is really fantastic. <br/><br/>What is the most interesting for all of us? Not so see how a man can beat 20 other guys, or to jump 5 meters up, it can be interesting, but we are very fascinated when we see THE REAL LIFE, pictured the way it really is. That's why, if the story is greatly and honestly said, some very ordinary things can be so refreshing, even though they are so normal and there is nothing special in them. But, they talk about us, about our lives. <br/><br/>I expected some real drama and when I saw 'comedy' in your page, I had some doubts. What can be funny in being sick? But, the movie gave the answer. Such a tragedy is full of all specter of emotions and events: humor, denial, sadness, love, disaster, fear, saying goodbye, desire to live, desire to end up the whole suffering,..., and this GREAT movie gave us ALL. <br/><br/>Its major value is its reality. All what you can expect in case of cancer, it is there.

The dialog between characters is absolutely hilarious at times, and about exactly what I was hoping for. One character that may get overlooked is Adam's mother. She is not in many scenes, but when she is, the actress plays her character spot on. I would describe her as an absolute nervous wreck, at times, and others as a typical worried mother. She did a fantastic job of making even me feel awkward for Adam at times. I don't know that overall this film will be very memorable as a whole, but I think there are certain scenes that will be. In particular the scene where Kyle, Seth Rogen's character, is helping Adam shave his head. This scene is spot on with how men are and act with one another and the scene is just simply a classic example of great acting. Also many scenes with Adam's therapist are quite memorable.

","50/50, is a brilliant emotional, comedy with drama film and biography, it is different to the similar typical films usually watched.<br/><br/>Throughout the film there was many highs and many lows, I believe the young, new comer director Jonathan Levine captured every historical, heart warming scene with perfection. The cast within the movie was very high profile, Seth Rogen (Pineapple express), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Inception), and two Oscar nominated actresses Anna Kendrick (Up in the air) and Bryce Dallas Howard (the Help). <br/><br/>Another decent performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, I believe he captured the role of a newly diagnosed patient with serious cancer brilliantly, I believe Joseph Gordon-Levitt should have had a Oscar nomination, but sadly he never. I believe the chemistry between Rogen and Levitt was perfect, the chatty humour was often carried throughout the film, and the bromance added to it. I believe the actors battled cancer with humour. <br/><br/>50/50 has brilliant performances and yet a brilliant movie."

","I'm not sure what I can say about this incredibly touching film that others haven't already said about it. 50/50 is an inspirational, real look at the life of a young man dealing with a physical ailment with 50/50 odds of survival. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a great choice as the lead (Adam), and Seth Rogan's performance takes me back to when I first saw him in 40-Year-Old Virgin. The script felt very much along the lines of ""Juno,"" except the major plot device was the illness' outcome rather than the decision for a young woman's baby. I loved revisiting the 90's music choices, and I hope this becomes I trend in modern films. Anyways, it's a tearjerker film that has a lot of heart and humor, and I recommend it completely."
"tbmforclasstsar","10","0","0","27 February 2012"," an inspiring journey of life and the surprises that come out of nowhere
","There have been a good number of films in the past that involve a lead character being diagnosed with cancer; tear-jerkers, inspirational dramas, chick-flicks. These usually are the genre titles for these movies. However, the new film ""50/50"" is a little more than these usual tags, a little less sappy, and just as moving.<br/><br/>""50/50,"" the new comedy/drama about a 27 year old named Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is diagnosed with cancer, is not your typical cancer diagnosis movie. Of course, it is typical to say that a film just feels real when you enjoy it, but this is one of the only cancer films in memory that gives a close to life portrayal of a battle with the disease.<br/><br/>This may be credit to the young man who wrote the script, Will Reiser. Reiser, who wrote the screenplay based off his own experiences when battling and beating cancer, offers a refreshing look at the genre. He doesn't hide away from the pain of the situation, but he adds in the humor and awakening that seems common place with the diagnosis. Every moment of every day is not complete despair for Adam, and Reiser's script allows for this humor and laughable moments to be used as comic relief, but, more importantly, a way to connect deeper with the character of Adam.<br/><br/>After Adam is diagnosed, he spends much of his time with his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen). Kyle may seem a little selfish and unreliable at times (he tries on multiple occasions to hook up with girls by using Adam's diagnosis as an in), but Kyle struggles with the diagnosis just like Adam.<br/><br/>This can also be said for Adam's girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard), his mother (Anjelica Huston), and even his young therapist (Anna Kendrick). Each deals with the situation in their own manner, some hurting Adam and some helping him, but the film does a nice job of including these stories to give a full perspective of the pain one diagnosis can cause.<br/><br/>Adam's family is anything but sound. His father has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and can't remember Adam is even his son at times, and his mother coddles and worries about Adam to a degree that Adam actually can't stand it. He doesn't return her calls or give her updates on his condition because he can't stand having to talk to her about it. She isn't trying to hurt Adam (""I smother him out of love"" she says later in the film), but the deep care causes a barrier to come between the mother and son.<br/><br/>Adam's girlfriend Rachel ends up hurting Adam the deepest, but tries to excuse her mistakes for the stress and pain she has been under the last few weeks. ""You don't know how hard it's been,"" she tells Adam, as if the guy who actually is losing his life has had an easier time. Adam may struggle with this the most because the pain she causes also brings on loneliness and wanting from Adam who feels like he is battling the disease alone.<br/><br/>The film brings out an interesting degree of realism to Adam's character in his discussions with his therapist Katherine. She is young and inexperienced (Adam is her third patient ever) and Adam struggles with the idea that she is trying to help him when it feels like she doesn't know what she is doing at times. But Adam starts to open up as the cancer continues to fight his body and eventually he has a moment with Katherine where he tells her how sick he is of hearing that he will be fine from everyone. Adam just wants people to tell him the truth; he is dying and there is not a lot he can do about it.<br/><br/>The late portions of the movie become very emotional for the characters and the audience alike, but it is never to the gooey, 'we are trying to make you cry' degree. The pain and despair Adam has seems real. The fear his friends and him share is heartbreaking, and the hope Adam is losing is torturous. We have come to know Adam and care for him deeply. We may not know him personally, but he is just like so many we may know and love. And even though cancer is terrible to have at any age, it hurts even more that Adam is so young; ""I've never been to Canada. I've never even told a girl I love her.""<br/><br/>The performances of all the actors in the film are powerful and the construction of the story and script allows for these characters to seem more than two dimensional. These aren't just characters on the screen. This is the friend you know that wants to get laid; the mother you have that treats you like a baby when you are an adult; the selfish partner that thinks her situation is worse than yours; the people that care for you and tell you that you will be fine. This is you and the struggles you would or have dealt with when battling cancer.<br/><br/>""50/50"" has its comedic and humorous moments, but it probably falls in line with a film like ""Knocked Up;"" that is a film that adds a more real and comedic element to a serious subject. The laughs are not forced, the struggles are real, and the result is extremely effective. ""50/50"" is a film that may seem too care free at times, but that is Adam's journey. It is a journey with laughs and tears, joy and fear. But, above all, it is a journey of life and the struggles that take you by complete surprise within it.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at CustodianFilmCritic.com"

"tbtitans21","8","0","0","21 February 2012"," Believed to be Hidden Message
","I did not find this movie gut-wrenchingly funny nor terribly sad. However, I did find meaning in this movie that is relating to my life right now. The man was fairly mistreated by the woman, just using him for seemingly unknown reasons, and he developed cancer whilst being mistreated. i.e. she wouldn't have sex with him for a long time even though being in a relationship. I feel like that is a big reason in what causes cancer. Being devalued as a human being is a very big problem, and if not shown on the surface, it is a very critical problem at the deep subconscious level. I'm forced to believe this is why he overcame it...because he counteracted the deep hatred for the woman that hadn't surfaced until he found out about her side hook-up. He learned to hate her for what she hadn't done for him even though he had done so much for her. Of course this is not how cancer starts in every case...however, once again, I am forced to believe it begins because of this...they are, in essence, becoming a cancer, by allowing themselves to be devalued by someone constantly even if they are a beautiful being. My first hand experience comes from me being the devalue-er, if you will. However, do not shame me for this, for I have tried multiple times to get this girl to want to be treated better. She is in love with me and will do everything to impress me, even if it means coming to my house at 11 at night at my will. We had a slight skirmish when I proclaimed that I was not indeed her girlfriend, to her friend, if she acts like a late night booty call. She is a genuinely sweet girl, but she is being devalued because she will not leave me. I want to let her go but I honestly want her to leave me for herself, so she will finally know what's good for her. She had a cancer scare a week ago and is awaiting one final confirmation test to tell her what probably already exists is really there. I write this review because I believe in the message 50/50 brings. It does 'take a pair to beat the odds'. And maybe, as I said before, a devaluing of the person is the instigator for the cancer. I think that a person should never be mistreated, whoever they are, especially this girl, but now I do not know how to continue. I do not love her, as she does me, and she seriously will not leave me no matter how badly I treat her. I will not be forced into loving her, after this display, that is for sure, but some help would be appreciated in continuing the relationship...I am about to try something as she is sitting next to me and I hope it works, for if it does not, I am out of options, and I believe the cancer will take over unless I fake love for her. If I make a grammar mistake or word choice mistake, I don't care, the message stays the same.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading."

","In a just universe, no one would get cancer and 50/50 would have been nominated for at least four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress. Why does it matter? It doesn't; or at least it shouldn't. But Hollywood owes it to the future of the industry to support slightly daring and off-beat films like 50/50 rather than smugly liberal (and covertly racist) movies like The Help or yet another Tom Hanks or Brad Pitt star vehicle.<br/><br/>For anyone who has had to deal with cancer themselves or in a loved one (and sadly, that probably means most of us), you owe it to yourself to see this wonderful film. When she heard about the subject matter, my wife refused to see it, having just recently lost her sister to the disease. It took me months to persuade her and she is now so taken by it that she's talked about little else since.<br/><br/>I assure you that, despite what you may think, you simply don't know how you're going to react to news like that received by Adam until you actually receive it. Posts on IMDb complain that he didn't cry enough, to which I have just one response: it's a two hour movie that covers a year in his life but the film chooses (very wisely) to focus on the many other ways in which he contended with his diagnosis. That is what makes this film such a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick are so beautifully cast that it is like that were made for these roles. Still in their 20's, at first neither of them - neither the patient nor the ""expert"" - fathoms that the world can present such difficult challenges. They're young, they have good jobs, they have good friends and are going to live forever, aren't they? Neither one has ever experienced deprivation or hardship.<br/><br/>I think part of the reason why Hollywood has had a hard time with 50/50 is that it doesn't fit neatly into any of the boxes that the industry machine has created. It was marketed badly and inaccurately, largely, one suspects, on the basis of that fact that Seth Rogen is in it (and he's very good, by the way). It deals with a subject that instinctively makes the audience uncomfortable, and it plays on that discomfort in an original way, without ever exploiting it.<br/><br/>An 8.5."

","50/50 is a fresh and original take on a very delicate subject such as cancer is, especially when it happens to a 27 years old young man. Unlike most of the other movies that have treated a similar story, 50/50 narration focuses only in the humorous aspect of it and avoids the tragic component. There are a few, subtle and very short dramatic moments in the movie, which are completely necessary to deliver a solid and realistic story, but this is a plain comedy 90% of the time, and when it's not, it really doesn't need to go for the low punch to succeed. 50/50 succeeds on involving every character around the patient and elaborating the story-telling through their relationship. In the end, this is a movie about friendship, love and family ties, and even when there's really nothing technically extraordinary about it, the result is very refreshing and entertaining. There are also some very funny gags, one of them a little dark, that made me laugh out loud. I enjoyed this movie a lot."

Now that the movie has hit home video I was finally able to catch this low key dramedy starring one of my favorite young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt(Inception, 500 Days of Summer). The premise of the movie certainly sounds dark and depressing as the movie is essentially about a man as he comes to terms that he will die because of spinal cancer.

","This film is not great; it is good for a laugh and some touching moments, but it is flawed in several ways. There are several moments that taint the atmosphere of the film and keep it from being great or even very good.<br/><br/>1) The performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt was slightly unbelievable. He never shows his true emotion in the film. Are you telling me that after all of the tragedy that strikes him, he doesn't ever cry? 2) Product placement. HOLY CRAP! This movie was practically a commercial! Swiffer, Apple, Prius, and North Face were all shoved down my throat in this film.<br/><br/>3) The humor was forced at times. It featured too many sophomoric sex jokes and pop culture references. That said, there were some genuinely hilarious moments to partially redeem the film.<br/><br/>To me, these make the movie feel less touching than it purports itself to be. This movie is a crowd-pleaser, Hollywood comedy that tries to balance regular jokes and personal tragedy. I don't think it succeeds in being great in either respect, but it is funny and deeply touching sometimes. It can be predictable and easy to understand, two aspects which aren't present in its antagonist, cancer. Watch it if you aren't particularly critical of films or if you don't expect a realistic portrayal of cancer patients.<br/><br/>7/10"

","The day 50/50 debuted in theaters, I went and saw it. The day it came out on blu-ray, I bought it. This was by far one of the BEST movies of 2011. Joseph Gordon-Levitt made me feel his anxiousness, regret and longing for the character. I felt Seth Rogen played a more tamed- down version of his past movies, but he still added to the chemistry of the cast. I was especially moved towards the end of the movie when their friendship is brought to light. Bryce Dallas Howard and some of the other roles where good to the story, but the one whom I feel deserved a great deal of credit was Anna Kendrick. She would be a patient's dream therapist. Her character was down-to-earth and honest. You could tell she was doing the best she could to comfort Adam. A quote about Ms. Kendrick from the movie...""I wish you were my girlfriend"" -Adam"

","I had not really planned on seeing this one previously, but what sparked interest was the rave reviews I got from my friends. Running for the Golden Globe, they say. It deserves to be.<br/><br/>Because it is very rare nowadays that you come across movies which doesn't contain any mushy love story- of people kissing under moonlight, running around hand-in-hand, staring at each other for a long time in the rain- but yet they manage to make you have that similar feeling, of being replete with emotions by the end.<br/><br/>What I liked about this movie is that it doesn't make you sympathize with the protagonist-a sincere person in life, who is diagnosed with cancer-rather, it makes you walk with him, feel alienated, feel grateful and realize, that life can not be that bad no matter what happens.<br/><br/>With a dash of humor to keep the movie from falling into that pit of boredom, director Jonathan Levine has done a memorable work with his cast, and ensured that every viewer understands the possibilities explored.There are people in the protagonists' life who let him down, there are people who stand by him, and there are some who are co-passengers in his journey- and in one way or other,everybody contributes.<br/><br/>Not really showing what movies with such a theme usually offer(to start appreciating life all of a sudden,like never before)-since our hero is already a realist-50/50 will make to my list of movies which have titles like The Social Network, The Prestige etc.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, I would say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt knew what he had to show, and did justice to the role. I expect him to become one of the biggest actors of the industry, in near future. He did not overdo things, and at the same time, did not make things paltry too. The right kind of expressions he had, I would say.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen blends in well, as the quintessential friend who stays with you during tough times, but again, he is not like those typical sympathetic-he uses Levitt's medical condition to get girls-but by the end, he cares. I enjoyed Anna Kendrick's presence, and would really love to see her play in more movies.<br/><br/>In short, a beautiful movie with promise of some really good moments, 50/50 is a surprisingly strong contender for the 84th Annual Academy Awards(yes the nominations are yet to arrive but I am positive), and also, a nice weekend-watch."

","Considering that I am a guy who went through cancer treatment when I was 26, this film naturally hit close to home. On top of that, I could see a lot in the film that worked--stuff that really connect with what it's like to go through this hell (such as the horribly detached way the doctor broke the news to the guy about his illness). It sure helped that the writer, Will Reiser, had gone through this himself.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt did not even register in most folks' minds until recently. He was just THAT kid from ""3rd Rock""--a rather inconsequential series at that. However, recently he's blown a lot of people away given his breakout performances in ""Inception"". He's shown here in ""50/50"" that he can do well now as a star. This is quite a jump from his TV days as a scrawny kid.<br/><br/>The film, as many people know, is about a guy who finds out he has cancer. The film is not the deepest thing--just one guy's experiences with the disease as well as the experiences of those around him. In some cases, people really come through for them and in others, folks show their inadequacy--just as in real life--and just like what happened when I was ill. I liked this and I also liked how the character was NOT noble--he was just a guy. Well worth seeing, that's for sure.<br/><br/>Now I do have a few minor reservations in this excellent film. First, while I liked Rogan quite a bit (such as his using his friend's cancer to help him score with women as well as the way he reacted to THE breakup), he is VERY crude. Funny, yes....but VERY crude. Parents might want to think about this Secondly, the psychotherapist character (Anna Kendrick) is possibly the worst therapist in movie history. She apparently has no boundaries, no training and is a sweet idiot. Hopefully folks WON'T think that any of her behaviors are acceptable!! And, I cannot imagine ANY college allowing anyone that dippy to go near patients!! I used to be a psychotherapist many years ago--and I actually trained young counselors to do therapy. Even the dumbest and most inept grad student I ever met was light-years better than this goof-ball! Enjoyable but 100% unrealistic and the character should have been rewritten a bit to at least make her a bit more believable."

","As someone who had a minor bout with cancer myself, I can identify with some of the story presented here and was really surprised how well this film, about a twenty-something man who finds himself with a rare and potentially fatal type of cancer, presented much of it. My case was nowhere near as severe as Gordon-Levitt's Adam but, I can say the film really nailed the inner turmoil, the mixed thoughts and emotions, the unexpected humor that seems to come out of nowhere and the strange way people approach and talk to you when they find out. Not only is the script insightful but, really balances the heavy drama with the lighter and more touching moments perfectly. The film is never overly melodramatic or sappy, nor is it condescending with it's humor and it also never manipulates the audience but, let's the audience experience the emotions from the story itself. Obviously Director Jonathan Levine had a big part in making this sensitive story work so well but, he is also helped by getting really great performances out of a really great cast. Levitt is near perfect as a man suddenly faced with his mortality at a point in his life where he still has so much he wants to accomplish. Seth Rogen perfectly portrays that one friend who is always there to brighten spirits by adding just the right levity at just the right moments. The friend who loves you enough to make you feel stupid for feeling sorry for yourself and to take it when your inner anger makes you short tempered. Rounding out the cast is legendary Anjelica Huston as his mother, Bryce Dallas Howard as his undeserving girlfriend and Anna Kendrick as his therapist/ love interest. This is one of the best dramas I have seen in a long while and it adds enough humor to keep one from being overwhelmed and to remind us that, like life, there is almost always something to make us smile in even the worst situations. Bravo."

"iheart_ny","10","0","0","25 January 2012"," A salty-sweet heartbreaking-heartwarming tragicomedy,
","False advertising: it's the reason why so many people are disappointed with so many movies. A film's trailers and television spots are what convinces so many of us to go to the movies, and if a film's advertising is misleading, it is usually anything but a good thing. I've never seen a falsely advertised movie have better end results than ""50/50"". The film was marketed as a laugh-out-loud comedy in the vein of ""The Hangover"" and ""Superbad"". It's nothing like either of those movies, and oh, was I happy about that. <br/><br/>First of all, I find very few gross-out comedies to be soulful and important. For the most part, they are just throwaway fluff that are impossible to be remembered. ""50/50"" is definitely more of a drama than a comedy, which can be assumed from its premise alone.<br/><br/>It follows Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young man who re-examines his life after a terminal cancer diagnosis. His diagnosis is some rare kind of spinal cancer, and his chance of survival is at about 50/50. He intends to learn what matters in life, and to live every minute to its fullest, knowing that any one of those minutes could be his last. His profane and ignorant best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) and his young therapist Katherine (Anna Kendrick) supply him with optimism and humor when he needs it the most.<br/><br/>There has been a television show running for the past few years, with a similar concept called ""The Big C"", and this is pretty much that same kind of story. I love ""The Big C"", I think that it handles its difficult and horribly sad concept wonderfully, never making anything too dour or bleak, thanks to a much-needed sense of humor, however, despite being a fantastic series, not many people have seen ""The Big C"". What ""50/50"" is doing is basically telling the same story to a wider audience, and that's okay because of how strong it is on its own.<br/><br/>Being decidedly more a drama than a comedy, it has the pathos and dramatic flare that I expected, but it has a way of surprising the audience. It had me crying actual tears, and then laughing audibly a moment later. It's more dramatic than funny, although it is also very very funny. The most refreshing part was that it didn't try too hard to be a laugh-out-loud comedy. It appears effortless, but it definitely works.<br/><br/>Also, the supporting cast is dead-on. Anna Kendrick plays Adam's therapist, Katherine, a grad student working on her doctorate, whose third patient (ever) is Adam. Anjelica Huston plays Adam's overbearing mother, whose husband is dying of Alzheimer's. Huston gives a fiercely funny, yet understated performance. Bryce Dallas Howard is sure on a role. She seems to have a knack for playing terrible people. Between this and her role in ""The Help"" earlier this year, I wouldn't be surprised if her next role featured her kicking a puppy.<br/><br/>I think I'm a Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan. I loved his work in ""500 Days of Summer"", and he plays the easy-to-root-for everyman very well. I think Seth Rogen is funny, but he can easily be overkill. He plays the same role in every movie in which he stars, I find. However, he's clearly there for comic relief in this film, and he does his job fairly well.<br/><br/>I also have to applaud the script by Will Reiser, which is apparently semi-autobiographical. I think the right actors were clearly chosen, and everything fell into place from there, but this kind of film could be a disaster without the right screenplay. It shouldn't have been as good as it was, if I think about it. I don't know why I love ""The Big C"" as much as I do, but that and ""50/50"" share the same nuance and attitude about life and death, which I really appreciate. While not quite asking the ""big questions"" (reincarnation, meaning of life, etc), ""50/50"" seems very wise and very intelligent. It's the best case of false advertising in recent memory.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","""50/50"" is a beautiful movie because of how many times we see ourselves in Adam's world. Adam is a healthy, average young adult with his life seemingly figured out; he has a best friend Kyle, an attractive girlfriend Rachel, and a steady job in sound. Adam enjoys a balanced life. Although he can never seem to get ahead, he appears content with his position.<br/><br/>When Adam is diagnosed for back cancer, he battles the ticking clock for a sense of himself and the meaning of life. 50/50 represents his chances of survival; a scary probability that few have feared before.<br/><br/>The focus of the movie shifts between Adam and Kyle's friendship, Adam's personal life with his parents, psychologist Katie, and girlfriend, and Adam's cancer that slowly eats away at his safety and happiness. Many audience members can relate to the characters, who judge themselves heavily on their usefulness to Adam. Every parent who find themselves on the outside of their child's life, looking in, can relate to Adam's mother, who struggles to love her way into her son's life. Meanwhile, best friends watching the movie understand Kyle's feeling of helplessness; the attempt and inability to help their friend. Young adults in the audience can relate to Katie, who struggles with the infancy of her psychology career.<br/><br/>50/50 is a beautiful film because viewers see themselves as one or a combination of each of the characters. Seth Rogen writes a beautiful yet funny script with superb scenes representing Adam's feelings and state of life."

"JohnRayPeterson","8","0","0","19 January 2012"," A movie whose praise runs far and wide; it will be remembered
","At the recent Golden Globes Awards, the movie was nominated for best film (comedy or musical) and best actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The movie is very well rated by all the usual sources and if you read a few of the reviews by other users, you'll get how much this movie has touched the audience. It is very safe to say it will be a highly recommended movie for quite some time.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is an accomplished actor who, at the age of 30, has a filmography of 62 movies; with that number of movies under your belt, you 'gotta' have something to show for it and he does. If you've seen ""Killshot"" or ""The Lookout"" or ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" or ""Inception"" you have seen the diverse characters this actor can play. He plays his role as Adam in this movie with very convincing performances at all moments, the funny ones as well as the serious and heart wrenching ones. The writing was superb and it must have been a delight for Gordon-Levitt. His co-star or supporting actor if one sees it that way, Seth Rogen who plays Kyle, does a fine job at doing what he does best: look and sound sincere. This actor has now a following, one that has grown year after year. He has a certain popular appeal to his generation and the one right after and just beyond. Though he has been in 40 or so movies, and some were flops, he is remembered for the good ones; luckily for him they outnumber the not so good ones. I like him; there's just something about his voice that stands out, case in point ""Paul"" a comedy I really enjoyed. Anna Kendrick, who plays Katherine, delivers a performance as endearing as her performance in ""Up in the Air""; that was another great choice by the director (if he had anything to do with it).<br/><br/>The storyline of this movie is a serious one, nothing really funny about it, and it has a message we can all learn from; the comedy was necessary to make us watch and stay till the end. The writing and directing was successful in doing just that, keep us in our seat when we see hard and truly sad moments and even when we know more are yet to come. The movie could have had a variety of endings and it would not matter; everything prior to the scene of the surgery was all that made us laugh and cry and the parts that we will remember, the ones about people that matter. It is a very good movie."

","I didn't know what to expect from this movie. A true story of a young man dealing with cancer that also had Seth Rogan in the main cast. How would they find the right level of seriousness to touch the audience whilst at the same time making them laugh and actually feel pretty positive about things? Well I'm not quite sure how but the makers of Superbad did a real good job at it.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, who works in Radio with his best friend, Kyle (Seth Rogan). Once finding out he has cancer we are shown the different types of relationships Adam has in his life. Whether it be with his parents, girlfriend, best friend, doctor or therapist. I won't go into detail about them all but they all differ in some way or another, some bad, some good. The point of this is to show the audience who and what matters, not only in Adam's life but in their own. So whether you have cancer or you don't, you can still improve your life if you want to. Its about spotting the qualities such as the loyalty that is shown in Kyle as well as Adam's dog (a mans true best friend) and reflecting how important that is.<br/><br/>Seth Rogan is exactly like he is in most of his films, full of advice and knowledge and always capable of making people laugh. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also similar to his role in 500 Days of Summer, a nice guy with not too much confidence who you cant help feel sorry for. Apart from scenes where they try to pick up girls by using cancer for sympathy votes or the two of them generally being best friends the rest of the comedy is equally spread, it always follows a moment that is more serious which never makes the audience feel too down at any given point during the movie.<br/><br/>This film is completely original, it shouldn't work as well as it does but it succeeds more than I could explain. It doesn't hold the the greatest acting I have ever seen but films with comedy in don't really need that. The storyline and atmosphere of the film makes you feel good and it's hilarious at the right times. With the added bonus that it shows marijuana in a positive manor, there's not a whole lot the film could improve on."

","When I first heard that Joseph Gordon Lewitt and Seth Rogen and were going to star in this, I realized I just had to see this movie. Then I found out that IMDb said that this movie was going to be a COMEDY about cancer and I became skeptical. However, the reviews then started coming in and were mostly positive and I went in the movie with high expectations. I promise you that they were not high enough for this movie not only met but succeeded them with leaps and bounds!<br/><br/>The plot is that Adam(JGL)has been diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer and has a 50% chance of survival, during his ilness, he learns more about what he truly had and life. His best frienld, played by the always funny Seth Rogen supports him along with his family and try to help him get through this.<br/><br/>This not your typical disease of the week movie in which emotions are constantly being forced on you till the end and they fail to move you. As the movie moves on, Adam becomes a character you begin to root for and all I could think of was, 'please let him live'. Joseph Gordon Lewitt gives a groundbreaking performance as Adam, his best moments were the scene in the car and in the last few minutes.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen provides perfect comic relief to this movie,this is my favorite performance from him so far and I see him in Big Roles in the future. and the jokes are balanced so perfectly with the script that they don't stray from the story. The movie is a perfect mix between comedy and drama. Its funny, it's sad and at many occasions, it's both.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, it's beautifully directed, the song choice is awesome and placed at perfect timings. Most Importantly, I appreciate my friends and family a lot more after watching this.(I swear I got up to hug my mom at the end) Very few movies exist that made my heartache and nearly brought tears to my eyes from the sadness of what's going on, this is not one of them...because it BREAKS my heart and HAS ME CRYING like crazy in the the last few minutes.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the best movie of 2011 and a definite must see. <br/><br/>I give it a strong 10/10 stars."

","Everyone has their own ideas and notions about movies that tackle the subject of a person with a terminal illness, be it cancer or something else.<br/><br/>Most of us tend to avoid them because they can often be too overly dramatic and depressing. 50/50 is a sure break from that mold.<br/><br/>Now being called a cancer comedy, I have to say that term is quite appropriate. <br/><br/>It's a really funny movie, which does not mean it won't make you cry. The driving force is the actor who plays Adam. (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)<br/><br/>Adam is a 27 year old writer of radio programs and is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. This comes as a shock to Adam, (as it would to anyone) a mild-manner young man who in his own words, doesn't drink or smoke. The subsequent events follow him as he tries to gently break the news to his family and friends. Everyone reacts to it differently as people would in a true to life situation.<br/><br/>Kyle (Seth Rogen) is appalled at first but proclaims that young people beat cancer all the time. This is a good role for Seth Rogen who usually only frequents raunchy comedies. Not to say he diverts from what is clearly his strong suit. It acts as comic relief here and it works as the part of Kyle is quite well-rounded.<br/><br/>There is a specific reason for this.<br/><br/>Adam is based on writer Will Reiser, who was diagnosed with cancer and later recovered. Reiser called Adam an extension of himself.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen, who plays Kyle, helped Reiser cope with his disease and convinced him to write a screenplay during their early 20s together.<br/><br/>Anjelica Huston who plays the role of Adam's mother (Diane) is magnificent. She reacts as any mother would in such a situation and the little scenes she shares with Adam are very earnest and emotional.<br/><br/>You also have Anna Kendrick as the young and inexperienced therapist Katherine (who is a fictional character) and Bryce Dallas Howard as Rachael, the sometimes distant girlfriend. She is an amalgam of various different people in Will Reiser's life.<br/><br/>I didn't think any of the actors did a bad job. Everyone was just right, with Joseph Gordon Levitt being the definition of nuance. Still considered a young actor by Hollywood standards, he has come a long way from TV shows and solely independent movies. If 50/50 is any indication, he should age like fine wine.<br/><br/>This a great film. Chances are you'll find something of substance, a few life lessons in between the laughs in 50/50."

","¨A tumor? Me? That doesn't make any sense though. I mean... I don't smoke, I don't drink... I recycle.¨<br/><br/>50/50 was recently nominated for the Golden Globes in the Best Comedy category, and deservingly so, but it could've just as well been included in the Best Drama category because the movie manages to find a perfect balance between comedy and drama. 50/50 isn't a hilarious movie, it really deals with some serious issues and it has its melodramatic moments, but it is difficult not to smile at this emotional movie. Director Jeremy Levine manages to put together a well crafted film that while at one moment has you holding out the tears, at the next has you laughing at the way some of these characters respond to the life threatening disease. It's a very difficult film to direct, but Levine manages to make a great movie thanks to a good story, a smart script, and a great cast. This is Levine's third film after debuting with the horror/comedy All the Boys Love Mandy Lane which I guess in a way was the beginning of this trademark for him in which he mixes up some genres. The script was perfect as well, managing the transitions from drama to comedy really well. Will Reiser actually wrote the script based on his personal life so I am sure this project was very personal for him, but it couldn't have been done better by anyone else. Reiser was actually pushed to write the script by his friend Seth Rogen who actually plays the same part in the movie that he did in real life, since it was in Rogen that Reiser found the support to deal with the diagnosis.<br/><br/>Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is only 27 years old when his life completely turns around after being diagnosed with a rare cancer disease and only has a 50/50 chance of surviving. He seemed to have a perfect life working as a writer for a radio program, living with his beautiful girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard), and always counting on his High School buddy Kyle (Seth Rogen) for a fun time. The diagnosis changes his life although at first he tries to continue being his normal self. Rachael and Kyle both decide to support Adam in their unusual ways, and Adam begins seeing a young therapist named Katherine (Anna Kendrick) that the hospital has assigned to him to deal with the situation. She isn't very experienced and is actually a pretty bad therapist, but does her best to try to help Adam. Rachael doesn't even want to accompany Adam while he is in chemotherapy and only drops him off in the hospital entrance. Adam makes some new friends in the hospital during their therapy sessions together: Mitch (Matt Frewer) and Alan (Philip Baker Hall) and introduced them to Kyle as well. As Adam's relationship with Rachael begins to deteriorate he finds more comfort in his friends and his therapist. Adam also grows closer to his overprotecting mother, Diane (Anjelica Huston), who already has a lot on her plate taking care of his sick father. The story is really well written and makes for an entertaining film and some memorable characters.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a great actor although sometimes he doesn't get the recognition he deserves. He always chooses great characters and interesting roles to play. In 50/50 he is absolutely wonderful making his character very believable while responding to the terrible disease. Seth Rogen plays his usual self, although in this movie it makes sense that he does since he is actually playing himself and I am sure many of the things he says in the movie are really the things he said to Reiser in real life. Bryce Dallas Howard has to try to play a different role soon because she is being type cast into these sort of bad girlfriend roles. It would be good to see her play something other than being the villain. Anna Kendrick is great as always with her unique sense of humor, although she doesn't shine as much as she did in Up in the Air, but of course she didn't get enough screen time this time. Anjelica Huston is great as always. The cast really does a terrific job in this movie and I guess it's because they had interesting characters to work with. The balance between the comedy and the drama is just perfect making this Levine's best film by far. This movie has its similarities with another Seth Rogen film, Funny People, which I also liked, but I think 50/50 is much better crafted and balances the drama with the comedy much better than the previous movie (mainly because Funny People never really worked as well as a comedy, but 50/50 really does).

","This movie took the cancer disease problem from a perspective of a real story and made a good affecting film that will make you cry at the end. This is one of the few movies that made me really cry. The acting was super good. The most wonderful character in this movie was Anna Kendrick. She was very cute and acting very professionally. Another good part of the movie that it almost talked about all the problems a cancer patient may face. I mean all the social issues like increasing love, sympathy, people making use of the patient case, betrayal and loyal people. I recommend this movie for you if you like these types of movies. I rated it 10/10 and it does worth it."

","Loosely based on the life of this film's screenwriter Will Reiser, '50/50' is A Genuinely Good Film, that does the trick. The Screenplay by Reiser is engaging, The Direction is good & The Performances are quite impressive. <br/><br/>'50/50', Inspired by a true story, is a comedy centered on a 27-year-old guy who learns of his cancer diagnosis, and his subsequent struggle to beat the disease.<br/><br/>'50/50' has a good start, a mediocre middle & a feel-good end. The depiction of it's protagonist's battle with cancer, and his entire journey, comes out well. Reiser's Screenplay is engaging. Jonathan Levine Directs this story well. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are passable. Music by Michael Giacchino, is excellent.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Joseph Gordon-Levitt excels in the lead role. Seth Rogen is routine. Anna Kendrick is emerging into a very, very fine performer. She delivers a fantastic performance. Bryce Dallas Howard is very convincing. Anjelica Huston is ever-dependable. Philip Baker Hall is in top-form. Serge Houde leaves a mark. <br/><br/>On the whole, '50/50' is a genuinely good effort. Watch it!"

","""50/50"" is based on the true story of the writer, Will Reiser himself. Maybe because it was a true experience, the emotions throughout the story turned out to be very true. It has a right amount of humour and at the same time some moments to make you teary-eyed. Very cleverly written and directed.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave a promising performance. He captured the emotions of the character really well and I can truly relate to him. I think he is starting to deliver some real acting skills and paving his way to stardom :). Seth Rogen just needed to be himself and he was good. The actress I am really starting to take notice is Bryce Dallas Howard (which happens to be Director Ron Howard's daughter). After watching her in ""The Help"" and now this one, I think she is coming to be another promising actress. I actually think she could do better than Anna Kendrick.<br/><br/>This movie really helps us reflect about what's really important in our lives. We expect ourselves to live up to 70, 80 years old or even more and eventually die of old age. But the truth is, anything can happen to change our lives, and we really need to find out what is really important in our lives and what is the reason of us living, and waste not any moment we have."

Nevertheless... have you ever feel a pinch of guilty if you don't do anything about it? it'd happen to me if I didn't tell everyone how good this movie is! My family went through this situation... a cancer I mean of course. Each one of the sequences is one hundred percent realistic! 50% drama, 50% comedy.... just as the real life!I felt very identified, I empathized that much ... Have you feel the same? No matter whether you has lived a cancer in your family or not, I'm sure you'll agree with me. It's a good film... I wish it won a lot of awards in spite of the fact it's a comedy instead of one of the a tragedies that usually wins at the Oscars..."

","I was not too keen on watching this. Cancer is frightening and I was apprehensive of either a morbid flick or a flippant one. The movie was neither. It did not minimize the physical or emotional damage wrought by the malady and its brutal treatment on the victim. But it also did not wallow in grim despair. Seth Rogen, as the best buddy, supplied the humor that lightened the mood (albeit tad predictable in his obsession with weed and getting laid.) The budding romance with the earnest, well intentioned but somewhat awkward therapist was deftly handled - it fit well with the flow of the movie and never overpowered the main theme - how a young man deals with cancer, its treatment, and the fallout on family and friends. <br/><br/>The acting was good, and the script was tight. I was engrossed and moved. Very nice movie."

","This will be a 3-part review.<br/><br/>1. As a ""Joseph Gordon-Levitt movie-lover"" I'm glad to say that this time Joseph Gordon-Levitt has done it again. 50/50 is successful mostly due to his stunning portrait of a young man diagnosed with cancer. Upsettingly, it seems to stop there. His strong performance aside, the rest of the cast does not offer many surprises.<br/><br/>2. The story does not try to be ""big"" or have the kind of intention to cater for a very wide array of audience groups. Nevertheless, it is still successful. The script is nicely written depicting the start to finish of a man's physical and psychological battle with a rare case of cancer. 50/50 feels like a nice little independent film and is presented throughout with that spirit.<br/><br/>3. If it were earlier in the year, I might say this can score a few Oscar nods. However, at the current stage almost close to the end of the race, I can only say the only possible category in which 50/50 can get a nomination is probably Best Original Screenplay, and it is not even very safe. While the Best Adapted Screenplay this year seems to have solid locks like Hugo, Descendants, Moneyball, we are still not very sure whether the Academy will nominate Young Adult or Bridesmaids over 50/50 beside the locks like Artist and Midnight in Paris. I'd be happy to see this get recognized, but with the Academy nowadays, I guess you never know. We'll just wait and see."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","0","24 December 2011"," Worth Your Time. Worth Your Money. A Surprisingly Good Film.
","Nicely scripted, hugely improvised & emotionally investing, the story of 50/50 is actually based on this film's writer, Will Reiser, who penned down the screenplay covering his own struggle with cancer & ends up making a satire out of it without really hurting the sentiments of anyone undergoing through the same diagnosis in their lives.<br/><br/>50/50 concerns Adam; a 27-year old guy who learns that he's diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer & that his chances of survival is 50%. The plot covers his subsequent struggle to beat the disease but in the process, he is finally able to see who & what are the most important things in his life.<br/><br/>Wonderfully directed by Jonathan Levine, the film deals with its sensitive subject in a real mature manner without hiding the pitiful sympathies these diagnosed patients receive from everyone at home or work, most of whom don't even really give a shite about what happens to you & simply pretend to care.<br/><br/>Adam is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt & his performance is really good. He carries off his character pretty well & nicely captures the experience of unexpected shock after finding out about the disease, the nervousness & fear of living with it, the change an event like this brings in life and the everyday struggle & frustration that comes along when you know that your days are numbered.<br/><br/>Yet, the biggest contribution comes from Seth Rogen in the role of Kyle; Adam's best friend who tries everything to prevent Adam from breaking down, is always there to cheer him up & treats him as if nothing major has happened. The rest of the supporting cast also chip in with fine performances & leaves nothing major to complain.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, 50/50 isn't a depressing cinematic experience but an enjoyable one which makes excellent use of humour from start to finish to keep the whole drama a lighthearted affair despite dealing with a serious illness & truly succeeds in accomplishing what it set out to do. Worth your time. Worth your money. Don't miss it."

","This was hands down one of my favourite film gems of the year. It had been hidden quietly in the midst of the IMDb list and I found it a while back but could find no where to watch it until it came out on DVD. I have not had an experience like this but even though it's a film you can tell that the actors put in a lot of effort for their roles and characters, and that's mainly what makes the film. <br/><br/>Seth Rogen is deemed a ""stupid and unfunny actor"" but in this film I think he really shows a different side of him as an actor, with a bit of his personal style in there too and it goes really well with the storyline. <br/><br/>I rate it a 9/10 :)"
"Ryan_MYeah","9","0","0","21 December 2011"," It isn't every day you see something this deep still make you laugh on occasion.
","The movie is something of a wonder. A touching, perfectly balanced dramatic comedy with few missteps. It's also something of a personal story for screenwriter Will Reiser. In fact, the script is actually a sort of autobiographical story. He was diagnosed with cancer in his 20's before recovering, and this lead him to write the script to this movie.<br/><br/>And this turns out to be the absolute highlight of 50/50. All of Reiser's characters are believably fleshed out, his pacing is completely confidant, and the movie is occasionally quite funny. But just because you see Seth Rogen's name in the credits, don't assume you'll see something completely hysterical. Reiser establishes a very deep, solemn tone that sometimes borders on depressing, but also knows when to pull back with some most welcome lightheartedness without undermining the serious issues the movie is trying to develop.<br/><br/>And as for the cast, there's not a bad performance to be found. I can do nothing but sing their praises all day. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a tremendous, emotionally devastating performance that reveals an ever growing sadness as layers are peeled back. Seth Rogen provides the film with appropriate doses of comic relief while still keeping to the consistency of the film's dramatic tone. Bryce Dallas Howard and Angelica Huston shine wonderfully in their supporting roles. And then we get down to Anna Kendrick. I think that the film kind of played up her naivety in the film's first half a bit much, but I still couldn't help but be charmed by her sincere presence.<br/><br/>I'm also really glad to see this one getting some awards traction. An Oscar nod for Original Screenplay had better be coming.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

","I dunno why, but I expected 50/50 to be a good movie, and gladly I wasn't disappointed at all. This movie is great for two reasons: First, it deals with a tough subject(cancer) in a realistic way. It does not try to depress the viewer, or make fun of cancer. Instead, it takes the middle road, smoothly balancing between drama and humor. And it succeeds doing that.<br/><br/>The second thing that makes this movie good is Joseph Gordon Levitt. While Seth Rogen is kinda in his usual role(which works great in the humor department) Gordon Levitt provides the real ""guts"" of this movie. His low- key acting and ordinary, imperfect character is great and allows us to easily identify with him. You believe his sadness, happiness, and charm. He's one of today's most versatile actors in my opinion. Anyway, I highly recommend 50/50..there's a 80/100 chance you'll like it (;"

","Well, first of all, is not a black comedy. It's more like Terms of Endearment (which is actually mentioned once) meets Superbad. And that's maybe not original, but is still awesome. It is a tear-dropper, but is not gonna kill you. Still, you gotta be prepared and might wanna watch this by yourself if you're ashamed of crying in public.<br/><br/>What a great actor Joseph Gordon Lewitt is turning into! All of the cast was perfect, even Bryce Dallas Howard whose work i'm not a fan of, delivers a realistic and bitchy girlfriend. I couldn't imagine other actress playing the mom but A. Houston. Anna Kendrick was decent as well and Seth Rogen was funny as usual, as the best friend who's fat, drunk, stoner and wants to score all the time. However, i'm kinda hoping this is his last part like this, to avoid being typecast. It's about time.<br/><br/>Get ready for touching scenes (the one in the car, the books, that mom...) and funny ones too. Not ha-ha funny, but chuckle nerdy funny. In fact, there is ad lib and pop cultural references throughout the movie, but just the right amount.

","Films that deal with sensitive issues in a comedic fashion run the risk of being to trivial and not giving enough light on the dark matter that is at hand. 50/50 however takes this risk and succeeds in it's efforts. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, a young, healthy individual who is shocked to find he has a rare type of cancer with only a 50/50 chance of survival. Finding a comedic side of this is hard but director Jonathan Levine makes it so the characters bring a comical side to how they deal with the situation, rather than poking fun at the tragic event itself.<br/><br/>Going into this film I had reservations having the memory of watching Adam Sander in 'Funny People' which failed to make me laugh, cry or feel any emotion at all. It came to my surprise however how 50/50 managed to change the emotion I was feeling within in minutes but doing so in a seamless way. This was mainly due to the central performance by Levitt who blew me away with how calm he kept his character throughout despite the desolate situation he is in. It's also worth noting that Seth Rogan, who plays Adam's best friend, Kyle, managed not to bring the obnoxious, drugged up performance he usually does but a realistic and touching approach to a friend who tries bring his friend through this time.<br/><br/>50/50 is one of the best films I've seen this year. It deals with a dark issue while managing to keep a smile on your face throughout. It never minimalises the seriousness of cancer and never over exaggerates it. It keeps it on a perfect balance and is a film that's message is it's all going to be okay."

","As has no doubt been mentioned in every other review here, a young man's fight against cancer is not obvious comic material. To call this movie merely a comedy, however, doesn't give enough credit to the touching and sensitive handling of the subject matter. <br/><br/>It would be so easy to veer into areas of dubious taste with the humour or to go overboard with the sentimentality of it all, but this film does neither. When watching in the cinema I could clearly hear the same people both laughing and crying.<br/><br/>I can also do nothing but applaud the acting and the script. Seth Rogen does what you expect him to do and does it well. Anna Kendrick is so likable in all of the movies i've seen her in and this is no exception. Sooner or later that'll probably become annoying, but not yet. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is outstanding and Anjelica Huston adds some gravitas.<br/><br/>One of the most worthwhile movies of the year without a doubt."

I felt the relationship between a reluctant son and his emotional mother is well documented. When you see people having a life threatening sickness and battling it out to prolong their life, it is never easy to mix this with humor but the director cakewalks it. Expecting much more movies like this emotional,engaging,subtle and not over the top. I certainly think, this movie had become one of my all time favorite. Great Job."

","This film is extremely moving with a terrific plot and choice of actors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt for example, an actor who I first saw in 3rd Rock from the Sun as Tommy shows great skill in showing emotion in such a demanding role. Seth Rogen is as always a comic genius who brings some comedy to this otherwise quite serious movie, yet he manages not to overdo to it as one might expect of him but still gives a big enough punch to bring out some laughs. However the only snipe I could make at this movie is that Adam can keep his anger in him a bit to longer for an American and may be better to set him as an English as that is how we all act on this side of the pond to matters like these, English Repression. However other than that I don't think I can fault the movie that much at all and so I advise anyone who reads this to watch it immediately."

","I've never seen a film about cancer that was so real, that really said what needed to be said instead of cheesing everything up. I admit, it's a difficult matter to discuss without feeling you're treading on people's toes, but 50/50 does it perfectly.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character, Adam, is shown to be an upstanding citizen; waiting for the green man to cross the road, recycling, didn't drink, didn't smoke, that's what makes it all the more frustrating for him, and us, when he gets cancer. It not only deals with cancer, but Alzheimer's's as well, with some truly heart rendering moments. Look out for the beautiful volcano metaphor and you may guess Adam's (Gordon-Levitt) outcome.<br/><br/>Basically, take your tissues but don't be afraid to laugh, Gordon-Levitt looks more like an alien with his shaved head than he did in 3rd Rock From The Sun. Seth Rogen offers some hilarious moments, including his analysis, ""every celebrity beats cancer,"" and Anjelica Huston is the perfect smothering mother."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","5 December 2011"," A first class cast of non-first-line actors
","Let's get to the cast right away.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt drew applauses in abundance with ""(500) Days of Summer"" and was further recognized with the main support role in the ensemble cast of ""Inception"". In ""50/50"" he delivers a good range of various reactions of a not-quite-thirty young man Adam to the irreconcilable fate of being the victim of a rare spinal cancer which has a 50/50 chance of recovery (and therefore a 50/50 chance of dying). With easy disposition and low-key adorability, he has the audience with him in no time at all. Equally endearing is Anna Kendrick. Not quite standing out as Jessica in the ""Twilight"" series, she proved herself in ""Up in the air"" which earned her nominations for both Oscar and Golden Globe. In ""50/50"" she is the green horn therapist Katherine given the charge of Adam. Not too experienced but determinedly professional, she tries her best to overcome the patient's normal resistance until something clicks between. Endearing in a very different sort of way is one the audience knows well, Seth Rogen, as Kyle, Adam's buddy since high school behind whose coarse persona is as true a friend as you can ever get.<br/><br/>There are more. Playing Adam's mother is inimitable Anjelica Huston, memorable in so many roles. While ""50/50"" doesn't pose a particularly challenge to her, she has brought to her character an extra touch of humanity. At one time M. Night Shyamalan's eerie lady, Bryce Dallas Howard showed her versatility in ""Hereafter"" in a small but impressive role. In ""50/50"" she has an unenviable role as Adam's deserting girlfriend Rachael. This could have been a one-dimensional character but for her thoughtful portrayal. Among a group of Adam's fellow chemo-treatment patients is one played by veteran Philip Baker Hall with a sparkling performance.<br/><br/>All the plot elements are familiar: battling a deadly disease, devoted buddies, good-intentioned dominating mother, breaking-up opening room for finding true love. It's the way these elements are put together that set a movie apart, which can be in either direction. This one is well put together, with good balance and alternation between comedy and poignancy. Also to its particular credit are its flashes of insight. The one most memorable line is from observant Katherine to Adam about his mother Diane, something to the effects that she has a husband who can't talk to her (because of Alzheimer) and a son who wouldn't talk to her, an angle which Adam never saw before. There is also a quick-witted moment when in the hospital waiting room where Diane and Kyle first meet Katherine. Upon realizing that she is his therapist, there is immediate and synchronized reaction – he claiming that he is not really an asshole and she explaining that she had always pressured him only for his own good. It's the superb acting of Rogen and Houston that nailed this scene, pitch-perfect."

","It was so right to make this a comedy. It would have worked just as well as a drama in the 'Philadelphia' tradition, but adding humour was a great decision, as it eases tension from a morbid subject. I felt good after seeing it and don't have a problem with recommending it, even during Christmas. <br/><br/>We first see Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) smiling while jogging cautiously. He stops at traffic lights even though there isn't a car in sight. We understand why: Adam is a hypochondriac. He doesn't drink or smoke, he recycles and he has cleaning-OCD. He couldn't be more health conscious.<br/><br/>Adam's beautiful girlfriend, Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) believes in positive energy and probably only stays with him because few others would tolerate her falseness. Adam has a best friend, Kyle (Seth Rogan). He's the loquacious type, whose defining trait is that he's addicted to sex, or at least the pursuit of sex. He's a younger and dirtier version of John C. Reilly's character in 'Cedar Rapids'. <br/><br/>That's about as much of Adam's world we see until we're hit with it: He has cancer. Worse still, it's a form so rare that no one, not even other cancer patients, have heard of it. One guy tells Adam 'the more syllables, the worse it is'. A random website suggests his chances are fifty-fifty - 'Not bad odds', Kyle reassuringly tells him and adds, 'If you were in a casino, they'd be great odds!'. <br/><br/>Adam is assigned a rookie doctor, Katherine (Anna Kendrick), which doesn't inspire much confidence, but being such a nice fellow he goes with the flow. Their chemistry develops naturally and before they know it, the doctor-patient barrier has been broken. <br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt gives a credible performance. His characterisation doesn't particularly elicit our sympathy, but I sympathised with him nonetheless. Anjelica Huston plays his doting mom. I've seen her play a similar character before, in 'Buffalo '66', but like Kendrick's repeat performance from 'Up in the Air', hers also doesn't harm the film in anyway. <br/><br/>The funny moments are very funny indeed, but the dramatic ones manage to top them. It's especially brilliant when you have scenes, like the one where Kyle exposes Rachael, that contain both. Philip Baker Hall's cameo as a fellow cancer patient is wonderful. Here he's cast against type and is perfect as a cantankerous, weed-ingesting, profane old man. This kind of character can't be unfunny (remember Alan Arkin in 'Little Miss Sunshine'?). <br/><br/>I've know a few people who have cancer. What strikes me most about them is how relaxed they are. Many people assume that knowing you have cancer, especially a terminal form, would be unbearable. But for many patients the opposite is true. They accept their situation, remind themselves that death is natural and spend every second they have left doing the things most pleasurable to them. It isn't paradoxical to hear them describe their diagnosis as 'liberating'. Their behaviour is to be admired.<br/><br/>www.moseleyb13.com"

It starts of like most of the comedies I have seen, slow and easy. The characters is given room to be presented and their personalities take form. But then the film takes a turn that I didn't expect. It turns more and more into a drama and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is absolutely brilliant through the hole thing. But I'm really confused why the second role have been given to Seth Rogen. He cant act on a deeper level. His expressions are a bit limited. And that drops my score for this film.

","Young radio writer Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is happily living his life when he is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. Frustrated and gob-smacked, Adam tries to carry on with his life living with a disease that has a 50/50 chance of killing him. He lives with his selfish, self-centred girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is more fond of partying than looking after Adam's interests. Always there for him is his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), who is always on hand to provide medical marijuana, and his trainee psychologist Katherine (Anna Kendrick), while Adam's mother Diane (Anjelica Huston) has difficulty accepting it.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen and his writing team have already blended comedy-drama with disease in the brilliant and vastly underrated Funny People (2009), which brought out an award-worthy performance by Adam Sandler. Yet where Sandler's characters' disease was a prop that would propel his character in re-evaluating his life and choices, in 50/50 it is the focal point. We follow Adam though every stage of his illness, from the emotional torment and confusion after his diagnosis, through to his chemo, to the final operation that may ultimately kill him. Screenwriter Will Reiser, who wrote the film based on his own experiences, beautifully juxtaposes the sad and profoundly moving along with the funny. It is more heavy on the drama than the comedy, but the film is still hilarious, mainly thanks to the supporting actors.<br/><br/>Levitt is an extremely likable and hugely talented actor, and after years in independent cinema (starring in the likes of the wonderful Mysterious Skin (2004) and Brick (2005)), seems to be finally getting his deserved big break after the recent (500) Days of Summer (2009) and Inception (2010). Here he uses his every-man charisma to create a wholly believable nice-guy character. Ultimately though, the film belongs to Seth Rogen. He is surprisingly touching as the reliable best friend who can only communicate his affection with cock jokes and trying to get Adam laid. He also hates Rachael, and when he finds out that she is not putting out for Adam, he has possibly the best line of the whole film - ""if I was your girlfriend, I'd be sucking your cock right now!"".<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick also does herself no harm, expertly playing cute and sweet, and one half of a potential romance that I was really rooting for. The fact that Adam may die before they have a chance adds to underlying sadness. With Levitt and Kendrick as the two players, 50/50's rom-com moments achieve far more in small doses than the majority of other rom-com's can only dream of reaching. Huston displays why she is still an acting powerhouse, with her concerned yet hard-as-nails mother stealing the few scenes she has.<br/><br/>It is a film full of great performances, but special mention must also go to director Jonathan Levine, who keeps any technical flourishes to a bare minimum, allowing the actors to play out the fantastic script in front of a mainly hand-held camera. A wise decision, as the subject matter and the brilliance of the dialogue doesn't require flashy moments of quirkiness. He does, however, deliver an amusing and weirdly moving scene where Adam, stoned from his cancer-buddies 'special' macaroons, wanders down a hospital corridor in slow-motion, giggling at everything he sees, which includes people in various stages of their cancer and a dead body.<br/><br/>One of the best comedies of the decade, and one of the finest films of the year. 50/50 can sit alongside those other modern greats from Rogen and his gang - Superbad, Knocked Up (both 2007) and Funny People. Powerful, uplifting, hilarious, sad and extremely moving - it is not often that a film can achieve so much in such a subtle way.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

This was not the case with '50/50' as it had the perfect balance between comedy and the serious side of illness which is why i think its got such a good name.<br/><br/>Joseph Gorden Levitt is brilliant in this film as he has been one of the actors that people have had their eye on and this is where he is going to shine. He provides a brilliant performance as the audience will want to cry and laugh with his character as he gets us so involved in the film and how he feels with the disease.<br/><br/>At first i was worried that because it was going to be a typical Seth Rogen character that it could be a disaster but his character was perfect for the film. It seemed in the film that all of his 'cockiness' and acting a bit of an idiot like he normally does in his films was all his way of just dealing with what is going on so we sympathise for him. but he also, as always provides a lot of laughs.<br/><br/>Levine did a great job with this film in creating the characters to be so believable and i look forward to seeing more films from him in the future.<br/><br/>'50/50' is a great film about illness that is different than the normal all depressing stuff you will normally see in this type of film. it finds the perfect balance between comedy and the seriousness of the film."

It has an excellent mix between the serious side and the comedy side.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is excellent and even though I haven't been the biggest Seth Rogen fan before, I really do feel he did a fantastic job in this case.<br/><br/>I am surely going to make my friends watch this movie!"

","50/50 is about the grief going through the process of having cancer. You're fine at first and then all of a sudden, you're not. Adam is a perfect citizen. He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, and he even recycles yet he finds himself on the wrong side of cancer. He finds out that he has a rare kind of spinal cancer and his world is turned around just like that.<br/><br/>He starts seeing a shrink, which doesn't really help. He has a mother, whose husband has Alzheimer's so all she wants to do is smother him with love when he tells her he has cancer. He has a girlfriend who already didn't want to be with him and to top that off that he has cancer she eventually cheats on him. He has a best friend who helps him realize what a bitch his girlfriend has been to him.<br/><br/>At first, he's fine with the whole cancer, but then it starts to kill him when he looks it up on the internet that he only has a 50/50 chance of survival.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to everyone. There is comedy throughout but it is definitely not a comedy. It's a drama about dealing with cancer, and the best part about this movie is that it's based on a true story about when Will Reiser had cancer."

","Inspired by a true story, a comedy centered on a 27-year-old guy who learns of his cancer diagnosis, and his subsequent struggle to beat the disease.<br/><br/>When I heard of this film (more so of the fantastically done trailer) I had more expectations every news it gave out. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is surely an underrated actor who plays in favorites such as Inception or (500) Days of Summer. With him (and the pairing of Seth Rogan; also a great actor) the expectations arise more than expected. I sat down, alone, and had some great experience because I can say that 50/50 deserves it's 8.4. The film starts of like an average raunchy comedy. Don't worry, it ends soon after and develops into a greatly combination of comedy and drama. Prepare yourself for great acting, nicely shot scenes, and unexpected emotion. Let's start with the acting, shall we? The acting was great. People respect (as do I, more so) Joseph more and more every film he stars in. His acting was applause-worthy and was seriously the shining star. Examples: the car breakdown scene or the surgery scene. Seth Rogan also did a great job. I sure am disappointed that every film he is in he is the same old stoner, but in this film, it works. He starts of like a horrible friend but the moment Adam finds a cancer book in the bathroom, you understand more of him and start to care for their friendship. Friendship was undertone message soaring throughout, and surely was great. Everybody else was great in the film too, and I think of no complaints revolving around the acting. The scenes were nicely shot and the film (although somewhat of a low-budget) did quite a good job providing this factor. This 3rd film by the rising director has so much potential for later projects, and I am sure to follow. Although making this film sound great, it does have it's flaws. Fortunately, they are pretty 'undertone' and surely won't disrupt your enjoyment. I hated the silent father if that counts, but thankfully he isn't used to much in the context. So with all this neatly combined, I surely say go see it! It won't disappoint, expected, and will surely make you feel-good after, expected. 50/50, despite it's undertone flaws, gets a 8/10."

You move with main character, you can feel his emotions and you start seeing the world differently as he does. I felt touched and moved by the movie (and I guess thats what you want when you go to see such a movie), something I've not felt for a long time. It was the same feeling I had after watching ""Remember me"" (don't worry, its not a spoiler, this movie is something else altogether) <br/><br/>Frankly, its hard to believe that its from the same director who made ""All the Boys Love Mandy Lane"" (in case u're wondering, its Jonathan Levine - who seems to really have matured as a director. Well done mate!). Once again, the background score was amazing and the acting was simply brilliant. I've always liked Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but Seth Rogen outdid himself.

","Cancer is a difficult topic, this is a sweet film somewhat on the same lines as Juno, worth watching. <br/><br/>A conservative style of film making is good, especially when you want to show violence, pain etc. But when you are dealing with topics like cancer, it could also get a bit misleading or unrealistic. Getting the right balance is tough. People who haven't seen cancer close enough may get it all wrong. <br/><br/>Having said that most of the film works quite well, Kendrick is simply great as Katherine (she's also done a fabulous job in 'up in the air') and the magic between Gordon-Levitt & Kendrik comes across beautifully."

The pacing of the movie is right, the dialogue delivery is easy. The movie is easy on the senses as well. Alternating effortlessly between drama and comedy and sometimes mixing them up together.

","I usually like Seth Rogan but in this movie he fails. He tried to be a person simply being innocently incompetent at showing empathy by being superficial and hiding real concern. But he just ends up being unbelievably irritating. This is mostly the fault of Gordon-Levitt who is so lame he gathers no empathy from anyone. He is the proverbial limp dick who destroys the whole atmosphere. His heart was not in it. His mother tries to make up for previous remote motherhood - and we end up understanding why she was aloof from him in the first place. His laughably rude doctor would normally be sued for his blunt treatment but we end up almost siding with him. His incompetent support psychologist is beyond cute and useless. She was almost driving him to suicide - but Gordon-Levitt has simply no energy to even contemplate such a decision. In the end he gathers the least empathy from the people viewing this movie. The ending is as cheesy as it can possibly get. Don't waste your time. You only live once. This is not 50/50 but 100% useless."
"raulfaust","3","2","5","7 January 2014"," Dysentery
","Well, I'm just out of words to express how much I disliked this movie. The main reason for that is due to the unrealistic plot the writers delivered us. To begin with, the way doctor told him he had cancer was too rude to be true; any physician in the world would be a little more careful in telling that. Also, the female doctor's visit turned out to be completely unconvincing-- which doctor would eat and spread junk all around his working room? If that wasn't A LOT, that character was extremely boring and annoying; she was all the time like ""err, you know, that's OK, good"", trying to convince Gordon's character he had stress in his mind. Besides, Gordon's character was VERY irritating in trying to pretend he had nothing-- who on earth would act that inexpressive after the news he had been told? Fifty minutes were enough for me to give up on this, and that is sad. Just a bunch of relatively ""cool"" songs à la ""Juno"" won't hide the movie's emptiness, my friend. Just to point, this is nothing against Joseph Gordon-Levitt-- all I know about him is that he was in some Batman movies."

Seth Rogen played his usual humorous part, and I do like that the writers/director incorporated that humor into what would have been a horribly sad movie otherwise. Luckily, I and those close to me have never been diagnosed with a terminal illness, so I could never question the authenticity of that portrayal. But his slow decline in health seemed very realistic.

"advaitkamat","8","1","2","5 June 2013"," Poignant yet funny.
","It's really hard to believe that ""50/50"" is a comedy about a guy with cancer. Not many find this topic particularly funny, but director Jonathan Levine has got it all figured out - he's made a film that is genuinely moving and surprisingly zany. He hasn't employed anything special to make it so affecting, but the script here by Will Reiser, who had been diagnosed with a malignant spine tumor some years ago, is wondrously perfect. Reiser has based the story on his battle and subsequent victory over cancer, which means that we can expect an accurate insight into its potency but first he makes you laugh till your sides hurt before, delicately and discreetly, placing it in a territory wherein you can see the darker, austere side of it. <br/><br/>Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young public radio journalist who lives with his girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard). One day, he decides to see an oncologist concerning a serious back pain he has been experiencing for the past few days. The oncologist tells him that he has a rare form of spine cancer and that the tumor has been growing steadily over the past few days. Reluctant to embrace the fact at first, Adam learns that he needs to somehow prepare himself for the worst, considering that his chances of survival are strictly divided. He turns to his best friend and co-worker Kyle (Seth Rogen) for help to deal with it. He also lets on the news to his overbearing mother Diane (Anjelica Huston), who wants to move in with him and take care of him along with his father Richard (Serge Houde), who is suffering from Alzheimer's. Though Adam downplays the seriousness of his cancer, he finds himself getting increasingly obsessed about learning more about it. He decides to undergo chemotherapy, where he meets two older cancer patients Alan (Philip Baker Hall) and Mitch (Matt Frewer), who advise him not to stress himself much about it. He also decides to see a recommended though inexperienced therapist Katherine (Anna Kendrick). As the cancer worsens, Adam finds his relationships slowly deteriorating. His ensuing struggle with the disease helps him to discover more about himself and about the people around him.<br/><br/>Of the many films that have recently come out and that have discussed cancer as a subject, there hasn't been a single film as acerbically honest as ""50/50"". And that is why this film, with the stark neatness of its script and the superlative performances, gets most of what it wants to say hit the bullseye. The writing is delightfully funny in parts, an example of which is the scene where Adam takes his first chemotherapy session. Hall's rendition of Alan, an old cancer patient, cheerfully tells Adam that his cancer is in its fifth stage, and then mocks him when he learns the absurd name of Adam's cancer. There are moments like these scattered all over the film where you can't help but feel for them but Hall and Frewer, who are both absolutely terrific in their roles, infect you with the candor they bring to their characters. I was thankful that the hint of romance between Adam and Katherine was not left half-baked after the film settles into a serious drama mode in its second half. Levine handles it with infallible matureness, making sure that the prime story is not taken over by it. Reiser's script is deliciously candid, giving us a peek into the brusque life of a cancer patient and invariably portraying it with unflinching realism. In one supremely well-written scene, Adam chides Katherine because of her optimistic approach, saying he'll feel a lot better if someone was actually honest into telling him how serious his condition is. I was surprised how frank the moment was, because we've been so used to dying people being really strong in the face of death in the movies that, for a moment, we had forgotten that courage may fail some in the same situation. And the film so clearly tells us that that is no big deal.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is spectacular in the role of Adam, nailing both the sides to his character with astonishing ease. It's easy to sympathize with his character. Rogen's interpretation of Kyle is a triumph, bringing the much needed laughs and energy to the plot. Kendrick is immensely likable as Katherine and Huston is wonderful in a role that could've been a blunder had it not been played the way it has.<br/><br/>There is nothing really wrong with ""50/50"". It's a resolved appraisal of cancer and not at all a sombre one, if that's what you're thinking. But, like all films on this subject, it makes its share of compelling arguments. It's intelligent and searingly honest in its approach, and eventually makes its point heard loud and clear. You won't walk out of it unaffected."

","This is a film, avowedly based on a true story, with substantial critical admirers; I can only say I found it charmless, shallow, smug and unlikable: a romance weepier about cancer with a very serious attitude. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, a 20-something guy with a sketchily imagined job in public radio. Seth Rogen plays Kyle, his goofy skirt-chasing buddy and wingman. Bryce Dallas Howard plays his artist girlfriend Rachel. One day, Adam complains of back pain and breathlessness and the next thing you know he is diagnosed with a form of cancer that, he learns from the web, gives him a 50/50 chance of survival. However smart and savvy the movie looks at first glance, this is basically yet another example of sentimental Hollywood Cancer: Adam prey-emits the traditionally understood byproducts of chemotherapy by shaving his head and there seem to be no other serious symptoms,other than having to abandon sex with a super-hot girl in midstream because it's too painful. Rachel is aggressively dumped because she cheats on him, and Kyle is bafflingly exultant, actually encouraging him to burn the painting she gave him. Is that supposed to be funny and heroic? Rogen's character just looks boorish, ugly and misogynist. This film leaves a strange taste in the mouth."

","In 50/50 Joseph Gordon-Levitt manages to make a seemingly ordinary character into someone quite special. Gordon-Levitt was always a reliable actor but in 50/50 he delivers a performance worthy of much praise and even worthy of that glossy corporate Oscar. The film is a comedy-drama about Adam Lerner, a young man who finds out that he has cancer. The witty script was written by Will Reiser and inspired by Reiser's own experience with cancer. The film also stars Seth Rogen, Anna Kendrick, Bryce Dallas Howard, Anjelica Huston, Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer. Rogen, pretty much playing himself, delivers another of the film's excellent performances as Adam's sex-obsessed but reliable best friend Kyle Hirons. Then there's the adorable Kendrick as Adam's inexperienced therapist Katherine McKay. Honestly, the more I see Kendrick the more I like her. She's certainly a good screen presence and she tackles her roles differently, making each one stand out. It's no wonder that Jason Reitman picked her for the role of Natalie Keener in Up In The Air (2009) after seeing her impressive performance in Rocket Science (2007). 50/50 is reminiscent of the great 1983 hit Terms Of Endearment. One can even say that it's in the same league as that film. The moment when Adam embraces his mother before being taken to the operating room is poignant. Gordon-Levitt doesn't overplay it. It's this approach which makes his performance special. He certainly tried to distinguish himself after his role in 3rd Rock From The Sun, acting in films by directors like Rian Johnson, Christopher Nolan and Gregg Araki. In conclusion, 50/50 is a good and entertaining film with a wonderful cast. It's certainly worth seeing."

It had me laughing throughout, and sobbing from the middle to the end-- a rare reaction of mine to films these days. <br/><br/>What I enjoyed most was that the humor was subtle, sometimes suggestive and dead-pan, rather than overly overt and obnoxious like most 'comedies' these days.

He is not your regular hero who is the style statement of the society he lives in, no he is shy and refuses to give up the "" about volcanoes"" piece to go on air. Yup he works at a radio station. Then all of a sudden he gets to know he has a rare cancer. He undergoes chemotherapy and goes to a therapist. His life around him breaks apart. How does he lead a life where there is uncertainty? Does he survive? <br/><br/>CHATACTERS:<br/><br/>Joseph Gordan plays the trouble youngster (well he is 29) who gets cancer which happens to be rare and the survival rate is 50% ( you guessed it right, that is why the movie is called 50/50). His transformation is well etched, not only mentally but also physically. After he gets cancer he becomes paler and paler and so thin. He loses interest in life and loses his confidence gradually. The scene where he breaks down in the car makes you want to applaud, not because it is well acted but because you know that is how you would feel when you are in that situation. His character is so relatable.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays Adams friend. Surprisingly he is less annoying (Remember Green Hornet). He reads the book How to Face Cancer Together and he constantly tries to make Adam secure and happy. These things make you feel good. They trash down the painting of Adams ex-girlfriend together and it is so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>Anjelica Huston plays Adams mother who is portrayed as a strong woman who has to look after her husband who has Alzeimers and at the same time has to make her son feel secure.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick is the therapist who is so quirky and finally falls for Adam. It is not s big surprise but you keep rooting for Adam to win her over.<br/><br/>MOVIE:<br/><br/>Basically, nothing really wrong with this movie. You never want it to get over and when it ends you are not left with the feeling that "" Damn I hope it had not ended"". No you do not feel that. It is well paced and well written. It is not too dramatic and has a light sprinkle of humor all over. So you do not get tired of the characters.<br/><br/>The music is heart warming and not so jarring. The colors are gentle and you do not see colors that are sore to your eyes.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>It is really a heart warming tale of a guy who has cancer and is so troubled to face it. It is a really feel good movie with good humor. I will really recommend you to watch this movie for good performances and a clean story."

I really hoped to see Seth play in a serious role as a worried friend, instead of being the clown all the time. It didn't happen. And maybe it was the best after all. The seriousness blinked out in the book he read about people having cancer, and he is just a person. Not everyone get changed during life. So I found my peace in this Seth character. The movie isn't meant to be heavy although the topic is."

"eric262003","9","1","2","14 May 2012"," A Cancer Story That Refrains From Being Too Sentimental
","By balancing the the comical elements and the dramatic ones to a rather depressing subject like cancer, the trials and tribulations of living with it and the struggles to survive, ""50/50"" took a lot of craft and skill and a big hats off for director Jonathan Levine and writer Will Reiser for taking the risk to make this kind of movie possible. Other than ""The Bucket List"", there have been few movies like this one where cancer and the endless fight for survival is executed in a comical fashion, because in reality a topic like this is usually never taken lightly and most directors might have the fear of striking the wrong cord towards a sensitive audience member. Therefore, a subject like this is mainly for those who are enthused with emotional drama or Lifetime Network movies. I found it curiously refreshing that ""50/50"" succeeds in making you laugh while you're hoping our protagonist succeeds in his fight against this deadly disease. The comedy factor comes through the fact that it was based on true story with very real characters and yet never gets too the point where it becomes overtly sentimental, which makes the pitch of the story nearly perfect. With a subliminal script by Reiser and a terrific lead by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, this is hands down one of the best movies of 2011.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt stars as a 27 year-old young man whose life is put on hold after he was diagnosed with a deadly spinal cancer. Aghast from the news, he still tries to cope with everyday life and making the most out of it. But people around him and people who care about him starts to play even more pivotal parts in his quest to keep on living. Seth Rogen shines as his objectionable friend, Anjelica Huston is incredible as always as his often distanced mother who's in caring for her husband who has Alzheimer's Disease, Anna Kendrick looks very professional as his therapist, Bryce Dallas Howard is remarkable as his girlfriend and Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer are excellent as his chemotherapy partners who are in support with him all the way through. Everyone knows that life is precious and that we are all going to die one of these days. So we all must live our life to the fullest and never waste a moment of our lives. As Rogen forces Gordon-Levitt to supplement his illness for sensual pleasures is at times disturbing, but has its funny moments and succeeds in keeping it real.<br/><br/>""50/50"" sets the tone with the right balance of drama and comedy that's neither taken too lightly or too melancholy. Sure this provides plenty of laughs but there were a many scenes that will at the same time keep you riveted. The movie was inspired by Rogen's friend and writer Will Reiser as he himself was a cancer survivor and he put in the effort to refrain this movie from being a preachy and weepy story. I also feel that Joseph Gordon-Levitt has took a monumental leap in his career by starring in this movie. He's come a long way from his humble beginnings when he starred in the series ""Third Rock from the Sun"" and has amazed us with his versatility and chameleon intentions towards the characters he's played throughout his career. Recently he has played a variety of roles recently like ""500 Days of Summer"" and was exhilarating in ""Inception"". I won't be surprised if he wins an Oscar or a Golden Globe in the near future."
"Maleplatypus","9","1","2","28 March 2012"," What a nice movie!
","Another fine example how to make a beautiful movie on a low budget but with a good story, skillful direction and and excellent performance by Mr. Levitt (and other cast, even Mr. Rogen). Despite the rather dark theme, the movie is funny and as close to real life as it can be. Probably the most important of it all - it's optimistic. Why such almost perfect movies never even get a nomination for the Academy award? Still a mystery to me.<br/><br/>Highly recommended to everybody, especially to those who lose hope easily. There's something funny and good in everything. Give this movie 100 minutes of your life and you'll consider it well spent."

","Where do i start?! I only watched this movie recently and I could not believe i left it so late. For those who have not seen this film and are reading this review I would strongly recommend you watch this film, if you got a good sense of humour and a good heart then you will without a doubt love this movie. I personally believe that Joseph Gordon Levitt is not given the credit he deserves, to be honest, I was not very fond of him because I was too interested in other actors such as Johnny Depp and Denzel Washington. But when I watched the trailer for this film, I really got interested.<br/><br/>The movie is based around Joseph Levitt, I will not give away the story but from what you read, the movie is about him suffering from Cancer. How he did not win an Oscar for this performance I do not know!It is without a doubt a heart touching and funny movie that will not let you down. My review and most the other reviews on here will suggest you watch this film! So listen, and watch this film because it will be of your liking, whether your an action type or horror type, you will without a doubt like this! <br/><br/>To some, Joseph Gordon Levitt may seem like a ""Who is that?"" type actor at the moment, but in a year or two or maybe even when people see The Dark Knight Rises, that is when they will realise and say ""Levitt is an awesome actor"". He will be the next big thing in Hollywood. And after this performance, he has been recognised even more. <br/><br/>Do not wait till next week or next month, get the movie and watch it. I only created an IMDb account to review this movie because it really touched me, and I believe it will touch all of you. Worth the money."
"brando647","8","1","2","6 March 2012"," A Powerful Drama with a Light Comedic Edge
","When you're trying to advertise a heartfelt drama/comedy about one guy's struggle with his cancer diagnosis, perhaps it's not best to lead with the line ""from the guys who brought you SUPERBAD"". Not because I was fooled. No, I read reviews and follow news on movies that pique my interest. But the general movie-going public who relies solely on advertising when making decisions on what movies to check out, they might've felt a little gypped. I thought this movie was misrepresented in the trailers and TV spots, and I wonder if it led to the mediocre box office results. I didn't really see a lot of ads for it and the ones that I did see try to spin it as a ""laugh-out-loud"" comedy. Not quite. The movie is based on screenwriter Will Reiser's personal experiences when he was diagnoses and subsequently beat cancer in his mid-20s. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Adam Lerner, an employee for Seattle Public Radio and the ultimate personification of risk avoidance. He has no bad habits and won't even cross the street unless he's given the OK from a pedestrian signjust in case. Which is why it comes as such a surprise to him when he's diagnosed with a cancerous tumor on his spine. The odds aren't good, with most people finding a 50% chance of survival in the best cases. Now he begins the process of coping with his illness and his 50/50 odds with the help of his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), his artist girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), his over-bearing mother (Anjelica Huston), and his new therapist (Anna Kendrick).<br/><br/>Yes, 50/50 is just as much a comedy as it is a drama, but it's not fair to label it as being in the same vein as the previous Rogen/Goldberg movies (SUPERBAD, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS). The association is a loose one and the comedy isn't on the same level. 50/50 doesn't really rely on vulgar language, shock humor, or absurd situations for its laughs. It's a much more natural humor that arises from the strained situations between it's characters. The drama is actually much more prominent here and there are some real heavy scenes in the movie that'll put a lump in the throat of the hardest person. The entire third act of the movie, the vibe shifts to a more serious tone and features some of the most heart-wrenching bits in the entire film. People might not have been expecting such a serious approach to the film because of how it was marketed. You're not going to find yourself laughing yourself to tears at zany situations but you might just find yourself tearing up when Adam is preparing for a potentially dangerous surgery. Not so say that the movie isn't funny, because it has some great moments. The humor is really blatant, but it's enough to earn some chuckles from the viewer. It's a tamer humor that falls more in line with movies like OUR IDIOT BROTHER as opposed to the usual Apatow-style comedy.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has somehow managed to skyrocket into the spotlight with awesome roles in a long line of recent major films (I officially forgive him for his Cobra Commander), does an amazing job in this movie. I'm almost surprised that he didn't receive more critical attention for 50/50. He rides a perfect balance of strength and despair in the face of his own mortality. Seth Rogen is the primary reason this movie must've earned it's R-rating. He provides his trademark brand of explicit humor and ranting. Funny, yes, but it didn't really feel like it fit in with the rest of the movie. It's hard to see two characters as different as Adam and Kyle as actual friends, but Rogen has enough as a ""good buddy"" vibe that we buy him in his role. We believe him as a lovable loser who means well because that's what he's usually casted as. Anna Kendrick is adorable as a rookie therapist who's assigned to help Adam deal with his emotional struggle and still hasn't quite found her groove. Being that Adam is only her third patient, she's still trying things out and it's funny to watch her settle into her position. Not to mention, she has an excellent chemistry with Gordon-Levitt and you find yourself hoping the two get their happy ending. But this movie isn't about their relationship, it's about Adam's battle with cancer and how he, and everyone close to his life, comes to terms with it. It's a light-hearted comedy about a tender subject, but handles it in such a way that you feel the weight of the matter."
"CBW-2","9","1","2","1 March 2012"," Very good movie
","This film is about a cancer victim who remains relatively sane and calm after finding out about his illness, compared to all those around him. His friends, family, therapist, acquaintances all go crazy. This is a great premise for a story about cancer. I enjoyed this film very much. Also, I disagree with those few who criticize Seth Rogen's performance. I think he is brilliant. There are so many men essentially like his character, hard and profane on the outside, who have trouble communicating their feelings, with a soft lump hidden on the inside. I think he portrays this type brilliantly. Joseph Gordon Leavit (sp?) is terrific in the lead role. He is perfect for the role and gives such a measured performance, it builds beautifully. And Angelica Huston is so solid and believable as the mother."
"gradyharp","10","1","2","29 January 2012"," 'We all have to die at one point. It is part of life.'
","It is unclear why this film - 50/50 - isn't in the lists for Academy Awards nominations. Perhaps it is because the subject matter (cancer) is tough or because the PR for the film wasn't broad enough. But watch it for yourself and marvel at the script (written by Will Reiser based on his own story of having cancer), the direction by Jonathan Levine who understands how to balance the two faces of life - comedy and tragedy - as well as anyone, and the astonishing sensitive acting of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and one of the finest ensemble casts assembled. This is a film that examines the effect of a cancer diagnosis on a young man, his friends, his love life, and the people with whom he comes into contact because of his disease. And those people include us, the audience.<br/><br/>Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a 27 year old writer of radio programs, happy with living with his artist girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard) and spending his idle hours with his wisecracking goofy friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), has some back pain while jogging, visits a cold impersonal doctor (Andrew Airlie) who flatly diagnoses Schwannoma/Neurofibrosarcoma and informs Adam he must undergo chemotherapy to shrink the tumor of his spine before he can undergo surgery - the combined treatments offer a 50/50 chance of survival. Adam blindly accepts the information, shares it with Kyle, Rachel, and ultimately his mother (Anjelica Huston) and Alzheimer father (Serge Houde) - each of whom has a different reaction to the news: Kyle worries the Adam's relationship with Rachel is bogus (Rachel is having an affair despite the fact that she claims she will 'be there' for Adam), his mother overreacts a bit and joins a support group for families with cancer diagnosed, Rachel leaves, and Adam begins chemotherapy.<br/><br/>At the hospital Adam joins two cancer victim men undergoing chemotherapy (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) and the three become close, sharing marijuana macaroons and keeping things light. Adam is assigned to a psychotherapy doctoral student Katherine (Anna Kendrick) who is younger than Adam and the two begin a series of sessions that, though awkward, open windows onto reality and to their individual and shared emotional backgrounds. Adam's chemotherapy succeeds in causing hair loss, headaches and vomiting but doesn't shrink the tumor. Adam is lined up for surgery and each person in Adam's life shows Adam their true colors.<br/><br/>Author Will Reiser has said 'Adam is very much an extension of me. But I didn't intend for that, it just happened. I just had so much I wanted to say. There's a real limitation on what you can and can't say - like you can't make fun of this, because it's taboo.' The result of his sharing his own experience is deftly portrayed in this rare comedy drama, allowing the viewer to see all sides of Cancer and how that diagnosis alters the life view of the victim and their support group. Seth Rogen has slimmed down and proves in this portrayal that he is capable of superb acting and character creation. Anna Kendrick, Anjelica Huston, Serge Houde, Philip Baker Hall, Matt Frewer and Bryce Dallas Howard render exceptional supporting roles. But the extraordinarily subtle and sensitive acting on the part of Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant: this is an actor who proves his chops in this career making role. His balance between pathos and the lightness of his comedic touch is simply worthy of an Oscar - or more. This is a surprising excellent film. Highly Recommended for all audiences. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

"or243","7","1","2","1 December 2011"," 50/50, as the title bargains, is a movie of two halves.
","50/50 is half-morbid, half-humorous; it's half-serious, half-light- hearted; it's half-bromance, half-rom-com. Indeed, 50/50, as the title bargains, is a movie of two halves.<br/><br/>Loosely based on screenwriter Will Reiser's personal experience, 50/50 presents Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as a naive young writer whose happy-go-lucky existence is stopped short by the diagnosis of a Schwannoma spinal tumour (yes, that's right, a Schwannoma spinal tumour).<br/><br/>The Internet forecasts a worrying survival rating of 50/50 for his tumour, but with the convenient help of his skirt-chasing, beer-guzzling bro Kyle (the disarmingly charmingly podgy Seth Rogen), Adam ventures to outsmart the odds, playing with a weak hand but a strong heart. It warms even the coldest of folk. Just ask me. This is a bromance for today's emotional bro. Its excessive sentimentality almost makes it a 'weepie' – but don't worry, dude, it's still boisterously macho. Like when Rogen encourages Gordon-Levitt to mutilate his ex- girlfriend's artwork with eggs, blades, and a make- shift flamethrower.<br/><br/>We first see Adam jogging and it's symbolically fitting for a performance which warms-up before breaking into a full sprint. It successively captures (even if only sketchily) the processes of cancer, from denial to sensing injustice (""That doesn't make any sense though. I mean I don't smoke, I don't drink I recycle.""). Each time wild fear visits his eyes, it compels you to pretend there's something in yours.<br/><br/>Katherine (Anna Kendrick as an endearingly naive psychotherapy student) is drafted in to comfort Gordon-Levitt, with resultingly tender exchanges and chipmunk smiles. Matt Frewer and Philip Baker Hall provide more comic relief as two cancer-stricken and lovin'-it old timers, as Gordon-Levitt's cancer 'touches' (what a horribly gentle euphemism!) everyone.<br/><br/>Rogen, who puts the 'ro' in 'bro', does his thing (equipped with genital hair jokes, surprise!) as laugh-snatching to Gordon-Levitt's tear- jerking. The initial fear that his usual over-the-top-ness will dilute the effect of the tragedy is dismissed, with even Rogen submitting a decent performance.<br/><br/>But the direction is without nuance. Director Jonathan Levine (The Wackness) adopts a flag-waving methodology in order to express the contrast of his 'cancer comedy' movie. The old bedfellows – Humour and Morbidity – renew their volatile relationship without even looking one another in the eye (as in 2009's Funny People). With a wink and a smile, Seth Rogen waves the flag of Humour: our cue to laugh. Ha, ha, ha. Soft acoustic string-plucking is truly the sound of Morbidity and Levine tediously evokes and re-evokes this stimulus, as we become sad, sad, sad. The comedy and the tragedy are seldom combined, leaving us with only a craving for the blurring of these lines.<br/><br/>Laughter, as fame holds it, is the best medicine (with runners-up morpheme and marijuana close behind). 50/50 realises this but it does not allow the humour to metastasise to the grieving body.<br/><br/>In the end 50/50 is a funny and moving film. But, without much effort, it falls short of being an important one."
"TheKris89","10","1","2","3 December 2011"," Equally funny and heartwarming!
","Sometimes movies that portray illness and hardship can come across as a bit cynical. Like the producers and director are carefully manipulating you to cry in certain scenes. And they can get a little sentimental and sobby. This movie didn't feel like that at all. All the emotions you get while watching this film, happiness, laughter, anger, sadness, and so forth, comes to you naturally, as you become engrossed in the story and grow more and more sympathetic of the characters. There's also a lot of comedy in the movie, many of the scenes were both funny and sad at the same time.<br/><br/>My gf would normally never spend money to see a drama/comedy movie in the cinema, as she feels the big screen and sound system needs some explosions or giant robots to justify their existence, but she absolutely loved this.<br/><br/>This movie was fantastic, highly recommended!"

","Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is 27 and has a comfortable life. A job he enjoys, a semi-live in girlfriend, an uncouth best friend, an overbearing mother and a father with Alzheimer's. And backache. When the backache turns out to be a fairly nasty cancer, things get turned somewhat upside down., and 50/50 (which, he discovers on the internet, are the survival prospects of someone with this type of cancer) tells of how he, and those around him, deal with the consequences of his diagnosis.<br/><br/>Wrongly billed as ""the cancer comedy"", 50/50 is a drama in which there is a lot of humour. The cancer is never treated lightly, but it is also clear that reactions to it, and how someone chooses to navigate their life after diagnosis, are important issues - how you live is perhaps more important than simply dealing with the illness. One of the strengths of this movie is that you do not know what is going to happen to Adam any more than he does, and you genuinely care about him.<br/><br/>There are terrific performances in this film. Gordon-Levitt continues to build on his reputation for strong roles which are mostly outside the mainstream. Rogen plays yet another variation on his customary foul-mouthed oaf character, but manages to convey a touching and genuine love for his friend (even so, I can have enough slacker obscenity fairly quickly). Bryce Dallas Howard is good as Adam's girlfriend, trying to do the right thing but not very well, and Anna Kendrick is terrific as Adam's inexperienced counsellor. Anjelica Houston is pretty good as Mom, too.<br/><br/>There were times when I was very moved by this film, and I was often amused, but I didn't laugh out loud at all - it isn't that sort of film, no matter what sort of press it has generated. I have read very strongly positive reviews: while it is undoubtedly a very good film, I wouldn't rate it has highly as others. Perhaps because I have been lucky enough never to have personally had a friend or family member touched by cancer, it may not reach me on as deep a personal level as it does some others: I don't know.<br/><br/>It is nonetheless a thoughtful, human, and entertaining movie, and I recommend it."

","Cancer and Comedy.<br/><br/>Two things that should never be mixed together. <br/><br/>However 50/50 does, and it works. Using the phrase comedy is slightly miss leading to be honest in this case. There are some really nice light comedic references/situations that lighten the mood of the film without detracting from the seriousness of it but in essence it is a drama. A heart felt, well written, well directed and extremely well acted masterpiece.<br/><br/>In a nutshell it is a very believable journey of not only one mans struggle with cancer but also the effects it has on people around him.<br/><br/>Before I went to see the film I was very apprehensive as just the thought of cancer makes my stomach turn and the last thing I wanted to do is watch something depressing and upsetting. Both of these elements rarely make it in to 50/50 and I just sat back and enjoyed it from start to finish. <br/><br/>What a great story and a great film. I highly recommend you go and see this one."

My watch of the film was very enjoyable with the laugh-out-loud moments, and then the tense heart touching ones. Exactly why I rate the film a 10/10.<br/><br/>The acting was great, the storyline of the film was sometimes not what you'd expect, surprising, but that's what makes 50/50 such a good film.

The story is about Adam who is diagnosed with a rare cancer and then comes to see life from a new perspective, and learns about what is important in life. What makes this story so good is that it is something that could (and did) happen in real life.<br/><br/>""50/50"" is carried a long way with the impressive acting by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (playing Adam). He was phenomenal in this role. I am not much of a fan of Seth Rogen (playing Kyle), but he did a good job in this movie as well.<br/><br/>Don't expect to be laughing hard throughout this movie, because the comedy in here is subtle and not really of the kind meant to make you laugh.

This is not a criticism. If you like Seth Rogen then you'll probably like this film.<br/><br/>I found myself unexpectedly welling up at times. The scenes between Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick's characters are amongst the best in the film, merging a nice balance of realistic dialogue and sharp screen-writing.<br/><br/>And if the end leaves you feeling a little deflated, keep in mind that it is based on actual events that happened to the scriptwriter.

Everybody reacts in different ways to how he has cancer, but it's with how he reacts to it himself that attach's us to his character.

For that, he gets applause.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen is Seth Rogen, in this movie. Now, to all you Seth Rogen haters, I know it may sound like a bad thing, but it actually isn't. He is the comic relief of this movie, and while he has the most profanity in this movie, his character is a likable character, based on the fact that he is the one that Adam looks to the most for support in this movie.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick is great in this movie as well, as the nervous therapist in this movie.

"JvH48","Null","1","2","26 October 2011"," Beautiful portrait how friends and relatives cope with a maybe (50/50) fatal spine tumor
","I saw this film as part of the Ghent filmfestival 2011, in the same week as ""Halt auf Freier Strecke"" aka ""Stopped on Track"" (Dresen; 2011) having a similar theme. Both portray how relatives and friends try to cope with the announcement of an immanent death due to a tumor diagnosis. Particularly interesting is how some evade the issue, while others rise to the challenge.<br/><br/>Both films succeed very well in showing how friends and relatives initially react, and how good or bad they find their own way in dealing with the issues at hand. The two films are very different in all other respects. The chances for survival for the spine tumor are 50/50, hence the title of the film, contrary to the brain tumor in Stopped On Track that is not curable in any way. Optimism is not appropriate for the latter film, because of the known fatal end result. In counterpart 50/50 a positive outcome is uncertain but feasible. This allows for humor and optimism, as that may well improve the chances for survival, according to popular belief.<br/><br/>Several nice touches are thrown in as extra ingredients. Firstly, we see the doctor explaining the diagnosis. His whole talk is directed to the notes and diagrams on his desk. He seems unable to look at the patient (Adam) before him. Secondly, when Adam's mother is invited to dinner, she apparently expects an announcement that he is going to marry his girl friend, or even that she is pregnant. Instead, when she learns about the tumor, she is annoyed that he waited two whole days to tell her. Thirdly, we see a group of four patients receiving chemo therapy on a regular basis. They gradually get to know each other, becoming sort of friends. At one day they discover that only three are left, after one died recently. Something everyone saw coming but still a shock for the three, emphasizing their possible near future the hard way.<br/><br/>Adam's friend Kyle has a very prominent role throughout, taking care of the humor department. In a delicate situation like this, his efforts might be considered inappropriate and too much to witness. In other words, you love it or you hate it. But he certainly has a better side, as appears later on. When buying support books recommended by the psycho therapist, Kyle abuses the sad story around Adam as opening lines to get girls interested in himself. But deep down he is not all opportunistic. We see with our own eyes that Kyle really has read the support books, shown by a lot of hand written notes in the margins.<br/><br/>The psycho therapy sessions with beginning therapist Katie could be hilarious, where it not that she does not act as a model for her profession. She does all the things that her tutors have forbidden, in her eagerness to comfort the patient. She can't help herself, sometimes even to the extent that it is embarrassing to watch. Can this be intentional??<br/><br/>Finally, an operation is needed to remove the tumor. I cannot reveal the end result of this operation, if only to avoid a spoiler. Anyway, the film comes to its finale soon after the operation. Its end result is less important than what happened in between, how everyone was able (or not) to deal with the situation. It lets us think how we behave ourselves when this would happen in our own lives. Maybe this film prepares us for this, and makes us a better patient, friend or family member.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm very satisfied with the film, the main actors and the ingredients for the story. You cannot help getting involved in how these people react, and their problems in doing their best, but not always succeed in that. I gave it 5 stars (out of 5) for the public prize competition when leaving the theater."

","This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>50 / 50 is the aptly name dramedy about cancer. Half of the film works beautifully ( the more serious half ) and the other part not so well. Part of the reason is that the comedic elements don't gel with the film's romantic subplots which tends to trivialize its more important disease-of-the-week subject. The grueling scenes of chemotherapy, the callowness of the medical system, and a patient's sudden setbacks just don't build to any significance due to the sit-com hijinks that befall the film's initial interesting premise.<br/><br/>Loosely based on a true story of screenwriter Will Reiser ( renamed Adam ), and real life friend of Seth Rogen ( renamed Kyle in the film ), 50 / 50 starts off very promisingly as we meet the likable Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the lead character who is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. His good life is slowly coming undone as he breaks the news to his best friend ( Rogen ), his girlfriend ( Bryce Dallas Howard ) and his mother ( the talented and underused Angelica Huston ). Therapy sessions are on order in the form of a perky and cute psychologist named Katie ( a miscast Anna Kendrick ) as Adam also befriends other sage cancer patients ( winningly played by Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer ).<br/><br/>Yes, it all sounds very predictable and it is. Director Jonathan Levine doesn't set the right tone at all for his film. The characters are not fully realized, especially the role of the therapist who tends to break every ethical boundary of her profession. Levine also allows Rogen ( one of the film's producers ) to ham up his role as The Buddy who tends to upstage Levitt every chance he gets. ( And this is one of Rogen's most restrained performance to date. )<br/><br/>Yet it is the remarkable talents of Joseph Gordon-Levitt that rescue the film. He subtly captures the horror of his dilemma and projects a bittersweet melancholia as he copes on a daily basis. This actor is so gifted and he is developing a fine resume with his challenging film choices. <br/><br/>In fact, due to his acting prowess ( and the skilled support of Serge Houde as the father and the previously mentioned Ms. Huston ) the film's final hospital scene delivers just the right mixture of pathos and humor that most of the film struggles to achieve. Were that Ms. Huston would have had even more scenes, 50 /50 could have become a truly memorable film experience and its odds at success unmatched.

"pyrocitor","9","1","2","21 October 2011"," Beats the odds
","Cancer sucks. There is no denying it. And, as such, the prospect of a mainstream 'comedy' revolving around a young man who contracts cancer would appear a dubious sell at best, whether for fear of it being melancholic or flooded with saccharine ""laughter is the best medicine"" tripe (interestingly, it appears the subject and blended tones have become somewhat of a trend of late, as director Ian Fitzgibbon's equally fantastic Death of a Superhero illustrates). Nonetheless, co-star Seth Rogen's proposed (and rejected) tagline for the film accurately and succinctly conveys the film's approach to its subject matter: ""F*ck Cancer"". This is not to suggest that the film gears wholeheartedly towards Rogen's usual ribald humour (though there is more than enough to keep the film gleefully enjoyable), but rather its refreshingly straight-shooting approach to a universally dreaded illness that has already been rendered redundant through a succession of banal, pseudo-profound Hollywood weepies. Conversely, director Jonathan Levine and writer (adapting his own autobiographical experiences with cancer) Will Reiser opt for an honest, human, tasteful (yes, even that), and necessarily funny mediation, making 50/50 not only on the effects of cancer on those suffering it but how those close to them find ways to manoeuvre meaningful relationships around it. <br/><br/>The autobiographical elements in Reiser's screenplay are what truly sell the film, as the film offers countless moments too strange not to be real, and come across as just downplayed and natural enough to provide all the hilarity, tragedy and poignancy that grandiose Hollywood set pieces could never approach (wait for a fleeting moment when Gordon-Levitt's Adam discovers a tenaciously annotated book in Rogen's apartment for a joyfully distraught emotional meltdown). 50/50 functions as one of the best 'tearjerkers' in years, because it is clearly more interested in making audiences laugh, thereby making the sadness all the more genuine and affecting in contrast. Equally, it feels all the more inspiring an optimistic to have a cancer film with a positive bent be based on true experience, as it serves to sell the film's optimistic approach as ultimately more credible than mere Hollywood contrivance – even a romantic subplot comes across as tentative and offbeat enough to function admirably within the scope of the film. <br/><br/>However, the true joy is watching 50/50 explore all of the figurative 'elephant in the room' circumstances revolving around cancer that most other films would either lose sight of or balk at. Pivotal concerns such as the infuriating dismissal of constantly being told ""Everything's going to be fine"", how friends and family being alternatively overbearing or absent can lead to an overall sense of alienation (watch, too, for the film's skillful editing and cinematography echoing these contrasts) and whether a bald head could offer the silver lining of a sympathy one night stand are all addressed frankly and honestly, and feel all the more effective for it. If there is a single concern to be made, it is that the film's pacing may feel ever so slightly off, giving less of a sense of a steadily mounting sense of urgency as Adam's condition worsens, but this too could be attributed to the disjointed sense of impending morality of cancer (as Adam suggests, everyone is dying, some simply faster than others), and thus comes across as a minuscule concern at most. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt only furthers his reputation as one of the most interesting contemporary stars, by cementing Adam as a human first and a cancer patient second. Blending a clipped, controlled approach to emotions with steady, fumbling attempts to reach out (as well as a laudable foregrounding of Adam's less than redeemable features, both before and after his diagnosis), Gordon-Levitt is as charming and hilarious as he is heartbreaking, emerging as one of the most compelling protagonists of the year. Equally, while his presence may have largely functioned to help greenlight and publicize the film, Seth Rogen channels his standard brand of bawdy humour through a far more sympathetic lens, as most of his character's quips (telling Adam ""C'mon, let's go get laid"" on the night before a life and death operation) come across as defense mechanisms preventing him from going to pieces. The two share an easy chemistry, and their buddy act makes for a truly enjoyable spectacle. <br/><br/>However, Anna Kendrick effortlessly matches (if not surpasses) them with a stellar turn as Adam's awkward, over earnest young therapist. Kendrick's unique charm and odd, irreverent portrayal of pathos mark her character as undeniably lovable and Kendrick herself as one of the most gifted rising talents in the industry. Bryce Dallas Howard emerges less favourably, being unfortunately typecast as Adam's neglectful girlfriend, though it is admirable that the script and Howard herself work hard to ingrain the character with some small vestiges of truth and balance, and Howard delivers a strong performance nonetheless. Finally, Angelica Huston steals scenes with remarkable aplomb as Adam's frantic, overprotective mother, and Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer make a delightful double act as Adam's cantankerous but good spirited chemotherapy buddies. <br/><br/>50/50 may not be an out-and-out comedy or tragedy, but it is certainly one of the most hilarious yet upsetting films of the year. It may not be a 'feel-good' film, but audiences will inevitably leave feeling fantastic. And it may not even be the singular most definitive cinematic treatment of cancer, but there is no question that it is certainly one of the most fresh, enjoyable and human mediations on the subject. <br/><br/>-9/10"

","50/50 (2011) *** Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen, Anna Kendrick, Bryce Dallas Howard, Anjelica Huston, Philip Baker Hall, Matt Frewer, Serge Houde. Affective dramedy about a young Seattle radio new producer (Gordon-Levitt in low-key yet highly empathic turn) whose sudden diagnoses of life-threatening cancer (hence the title's chances of survival) depicts his coping with the help of his best bud (Rogen, for once not being a total douche), his worry-wart mom (the always welcome Huston); his artist girlfriend who may not have his best interests at heart (Howard working it); and his green shrink (the plucky Kendrick). Based on screenwriter Will Reiser's real-life account in this semi-autobiographical depiction – and his friendship with Rogen adds to the verisimilitude – the film works on all accounts thanks largely to the even-handed direction by Jonathan Levine in mixing pathos with humor sprinkled liberally (best bit: Gordon-Levitt's wide-eye discovery of just how committed Rogen is to his plight: finding his bathroom reading material : a book on couples' coping with cancer together!)

","""50/50"" takes the dying-of-cancer genre and mixes it with the crass-and-crude comedy genre. The result is a film which is half-touching and half-funny, and only barely adds up to a whole. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has made a career out of playing the nice guy with the simple and subtle reactions, usually in light comedies, but as 27 year-old Adam there was a bit too much of the nice and light.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen has made a career out of playing the bumbling best friend with rude lines and sexual innuendos. As usual, he was still pretty funny here. But it is a weird mix when one friend is dying of cancer and the other is making jokes about getting laid in high school. It is also exactly what the film was trying to do.<br/><br/>Adam is trying to come to an understanding and acceptance of the finality of his life, and it is his life. He wants everybody to understand that. Whether it's the unhelpful assistance of his passive aggressive girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), or the awkward joke-making of his best friend, or the incessant meddling of his mother, Adam just wants to be left alone. Not actually alone, alone, but alone with them.<br/><br/>There was something void in Adam's struggle of his fate. He was perhaps too staid during a part of life that those of us who are the same age as him, won't be able to have the same understanding. Either way, there was something missing for that needed level of sympathy.<br/><br/>What was missing was a humorous, touching and compassionate love interest. She arrived in the form of the beautiful and funny Anna Kendrick. She was our connection to Adam. She was the one that was able to meld the comedy and the dying-of-cancer tragedy into something that wasn't weird. I would like to say that she came into the picture too late and was used too little, but ""50/50"" was trying to make it more about Adam and all the relationships in his life."

I was not familiar with Mr. Gordon-Levitt (my children knew him well) but was very impressed as he seemed to detect the tone needed; e.g., he could have easily over-acted in one or more scenes but held back to perfect effect. Both Miss Howard (whose acting I'd never liked before) and Miss Kendrick played their roles perfectly and a big hats off to the ""dad"" character (a tough role when you think about it!). I could have used a different ""friend"" than Rogan; e.g;. one less designed for comic relief. But Seth was great in the ""I nailed you!"" scenes. Good movie."

","I know, I know; you're saying ""Mister Blueghost, what in the world didn't you like about this film?"" Well, first off I did like it for what it was. BUT, and this is the director in me talking, you don't survive stage 4 cancer of any kind. Personal experience tells me this. If the plot of the film had been given a slightly higher emphasis instead of a casual nod (i.e. the mechanics of what the cancer was actually doing to our leading man), then the film would've shined.<br/><br/>As it stands now, we have a writer (or writing team) that dropped the ball on a number of issues. First of all films focus on the emotional elements of all stories that they tell, but here we got a real sugar coated ending that makes for a film that I really wouldn't care to see again. Modern marketing dictates that we get an upbeat film to keep drawing in ticket goers. Ergo, what's-his-name survives not only the surgery, but the cancer itself. No ambiguity about it.<br/><br/>But hey, it's essentially another chick flick married to the buddy-flick genre. Implication; happy ending.<br/><br/>But, what would've made for a better market draw over the long run would have been the ambiguity of survival at the end. Dude gets the girl at the end. Dude survives to get the girl. But we're never privy to the entire cancer experience, just his perspective on how it effects his social life, and nothing more. We don't see his personal insights, not really. We see his mood flux, but not a different perspective on the world. We don't get the sense that he's changed too much for his entire experience. We really don't.<br/><br/>He lives. He comes out on top, and his friend is the best friend anyone in the world could ask for. But for all that we don't see a real adjustment in character. Which begs the question if there really needs to be on in the first place. Meh, maybe not, but if you survive a life threatening experience, then you're bound to have a different outlook on how the world looks, feels, smells, sounds and just vibes in general. I'm not sure we really get that.<br/><br/>The film is what it is. It was a little too raunchy in terms of the sexual language for my taste, but it got its point across with great alacrity.<br/><br/>My vote is that this is a sugar coated cancer film that could have been much more than it ultimately became, but it's a decent flick for what it is.<br/><br/>Rated-R for language and some mild sexual situations, it's not exactly a family film.<br/><br/>Take a chance on it, and judge for yourself.<br/><br/>*eidt; 11/27/11* p.s. a bit of a remake of the Italian film ""One for Two""."

"tappingjeff","8","1","2","7 October 2011"," 50/50: A Chance Worth Taking
","Jonathan Levine's new dramedy 50/50 hits all the right notes. It takes the most essential of the human heartbreak and turns it into something real, emotional, and, surprisingly, hilarious. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, a young man stuck in a flux between his girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) and his nagging, desperate mother (Anjelica Huston). Matters only get worse, naturally, when Adam finds out he has an extremely rare form of cancer on his spine. His best friend (Seth Rogen) tries to find the positives in the situation, like getting laid out of sympathy, while Adam tries to figure everything out with his young, inexperienced psychologist (Anna Kendrick). As you can imagine, there is a good amount of heartwrenching scenes, but the thing that makes them great is they're not overcooked. It plays so much on the realism, that makes it even more powerful. <br/><br/>Will Reiser's script calls for a lot more than tragedy, however. It's a tricky subject to tackle, but Reiser does it almost perfectly. As much sadness that could be in a film about cancer, there is just as much, if not more, time for laughs. Seth Rogen gives his usual performance, but the personal aspect of this film (he essentially plays himself; Gordon-Levitt being a form of Reiser) takes him to a slightly new, better level of the performance he has given countless times before. The only real problem with the film is its misogynistic undertones, mainly from Rogen's character, which don't add to the film, and essentially demoralize it in a way. It was funny once, but the continuing notion seems a bit too crude for such an emotional story.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam perfectly; he is sweet and charming but you feel his struggle and the confusion as to what to do when faced with this in your life. Both supporting women give great performances. Anjelica Huston plays Adam's mother with a desperation to find someone; her husband has Alzheimer's and her son now with cancer, it drives all of Huston's choices and though she plays her kind of crazy, you understand all the while. Anna Kendrick gives her finest performance. Very grounded, but so well-crafted, her performance is not loud in any way. I often forgot that there was a celebrity behind the character, that's how great she was. If Up in the Air didn't prove Kendrick as a rising star, 50/50 has to.<br/><br/>Director Jonathan Levine doesn't seem to intervene too much in this film. The film feels well-guided but not super-imposed, like many other directors feel. The film feels so true to life, to the subtle triumphs that everyone with cancer has to at least tackle. He doesn't turn it into a sappy epic, he allows the characters to play as they would play in real life, and that is maybe the most resonant of them all. A"

Joseph Gordon-Levitt does an outstanding portrayal of a young man in such a bleak and dark situation. Seth Rogen acts the perfect part of this young mans best friend who is trying to cope with the reality that his best friend has a life threatening disease.

He captures the whole spectrum of emotions as his character looks in the face of death. Despite the difficult circumstances and the anger, frustration, and hopelessness that comes with it, his character continually seeks out hope and rays of light.<br/><br/>50/50 does a wonderful job at providing insights into both decaying relationships (main character's girlfriend), evolving relationships (main character's mother - excellent acting by Angelica Houston in a supporting role), and new relationships (main character's therapist and fellow cancer patients).<br/><br/>50/50 has many touching moments, as the main character uncovers the strengths of his relationships, as his family and friends deal with their own emotional challenges while trying to help the main character. Seth Rogan does a good job as his aimless, foul-mouthed best friend, and he provides many humorous moments with his loud and direct manner.<br/><br/>Overall, 50/50 does an excellent job with a difficult subject. 50/50 excels where Funny People, about Adam Sandler's character facing cancer, failed a couple years ago."
"griffolyon12","9","1","2","5 October 2011"," To Tell the Truth
","Adam is an ordinary 20-something: he has a job that he is passionate about, he has a girlfriend that his best friend despises, and he just happens to get diagnosed with a rare cancer that leaves his life chances at 50/50.<br/><br/>50/50 is a rarity of the cinematic landscape. It deals with cancer in not a sentimental, Bucket List kind of way, but rather in a way that feels authentic. Adam does not embark on a vast journey to live his life to his fullest, he actually deteriorates before our eyes, having moments where he is happy due to the rapport and humor he has with his best friend Kyle, and at other times he is exceedingly grumpy.<br/><br/>To be honest, the real star is writer Will Reiser, who wrote the story from his own personal battle with being a guy in his mid-20s diagnosed with cancer. This is what makes the story authentic. The dark humor that is sprinkled throughout, only a person who experienced this would be able to write from such a real perspective, rather than making everything dramatic. The thing is, in real life, no matter how bad the situation, there is still levity, there is still smiles and laughter, and Reiser captures that while also stirring the emotions through his screenplay. But don't go thinking 50/50 is a writer's showcase. The film sports a truly fine acting ensemble that brings Reiser's words to life.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives not his most controlled performance, but uses his everyman charm to make Adam a character worth rooting for. The biggest thing, is it is rare for me to see something with Seth Rogen in it and like it. He is perfect as Adam's friend, Kyle, who thinks the cure to cancer is using it to pick up chicks, but you really see how true a friend he is as he stands by Adam every step of the way. Anna Kendrick shines as Adam's young, 24-year-old therapist, who knows everything a book can teach but has no life experience, while Angelica Houston manages to steal the few scenes she is in as Adam's doting mother who is trying to deal with her son's cancer diagnosis whilst taking care of Adam's father with Altzheimer's (who Serge Houde makes the most out of simple reactions). And I know he's not an actor, I just wanna mention Michael Giacchino's magnificently refined score. Giacchino, known for big, verbose scores that sweep the viewer up in masterful uses of strings, keeps it simple here with soft electric guitar and piano, resulting in a soothing musical score that fits the piece perfectly.<br/><br/>Now, being fair, 50/50 was not without its faults. This is director Jonathan Levine's sophomore effort, and one can tell he is still young. There are times where his use of soft focus overpowered the performances of his actors, and he drew attention to his directing trying to create the emotion through the shot rather than through the actor's performances and the shot just being an aid. This is seen throughout the movie as he rarely sits on a close-up long enough to give the audience some time to read the actor's facial expressions and feel their performances. This is a weakness to the story, but one that does not keep Reiser's screenplay and the fabulous ensemble from pulling the viewer through, thanks to the sheer emotional landscape going from laugh-out-loud humor to tear duct-filled drama.<br/><br/>I give 50/50 a 9 out of 10!"

","This movie is a good blend of seriousness and comedy mixed into one film. Serious because of the cancer aspect of it and how a likable character deals with it. I would have passed on this movie to see it in theater but it has Joseph Gordon-Levitt facing cancer so it was a must watch. I didn't really like Seth Rogen in movies lately, well actually I just didn't care. But he was a key character in this movie and he was the one that actually added decent comedy elements to the movie. His character actually made the movie less depressing and bearable, because without his character this would have been a dark and just plain depressing. Mostly because Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character Adam is a guy that just let society and the people around him push him around while trying to do everything right. He doesn't smoke or anything like that and is a healthy guy and yet ironically he ends up with cancer. Not that cancer is something funny or anything like that but Seth Rogen played a important role for the lighthearted mood of it during certain parts or else the movie would have been just too serious. This isn't a groundbreaking movie about cancer but it's a believable movie about a guy dealing with cancer that has a 50/50 chance of surviving. It's a good movie that you will actually start to care abut the characters and actually had my attention most of the way through. The serious dramatic parts and comedic parts were blend in pretty well in this without being forced and even the romantic elements fit right in as well. It's a movie that is worth seeing at least once because of the good mix of different elements and because it has good character development.<br/><br/>7.8/10"

Such is this film's brilliance in allowing one to journey with the protagonist through what would be anyone's most difficult situation when faced with a severe medical condition that one has no control over, except to face the facts that Fate has dealt.

Revealing it to friends and family is tough, but as you would know will go to show just who your true friends are who would stand by you and provide morale support as you tackle it, in all honesty, alone.<br/><br/>What I thoroughly enjoyed about the film is its pacing, and its ability to cover plenty of themes from slice of life moments to the usual ones on family, friendship and romance even. It doesn't turn on heavy melodrama nor treat its material lightly as one would expect from its comedic moments seen in the trailers, but goes through it with plenty of dignity and decency despite the occasional tangent into crass jokes and vulgarities to lighten the mood once in a while, but ultimately drapes everything with sincere humanity that can be felt throughout the entire film, every step of the way.<br/><br/>As always, Joseph Gordon-Levitt shows just why he's one of the best actors of his generation, able to straddle both blockbuster films, with smaller ones that calls upon his acting chops to deliver memorable characters so real, his Adam is just like one of your best buddies, where you get to partake in his ups and downs in life, taking note of shared milestones together. You'll really feel for his character here through this trial and tribulation. Seth Rogen as Kyle, Adam's best friend and work colleague also aced his role despite playing what he does best in being the comedian of the duo, but essentially he's reprising what he had done for his friend Will Reiser, although with a lot more dramatic license adding to it. Both actors share this wonderful chemistry that made 50/50 such a delight to sit through especially since they light up the screen each time they appear together in the same scene, and when Kyle takes it upon himself to reap some booty benefits from his friend's condition.<br/><br/>Reiser's story doesn't have supporting characters who are one-dimensional, providing very rich stories and episodes in which they interact with the main leads, with so much room in character development you wonder at the efforts the filmmakers had to go through to solidly pack a punch in its pacing and narrative. Anna Kendrick whom was last seen as a rookie in Up in the Air opposite George Clooney, once again plays a relatively new therapist called Katherine, assigned to care for Adam. I suppose her fresh looks and girlie demeanour serves her well in acing such roles, while providing that subplot that finds no lack thereof in any romantic comedy. There's enough going on between Adam and Katherine without stating much of the obvious, and it worked marvellously. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Rachael, Adam's girlfriend, and in recent films I suppose she's deliberately branching off from goody-two- shoes roles to becoming more of the type of women anyone loves to hate, and pulling it off no less. And veteran Angelica Huston gets a small role as Adam's smothering mom, who in all earnestness, is probably like any other mom who's absolutely protective of her kids.<br/><br/>With an excellent, eclectic soundtrack to pepper the narrative, heartfelt performances even from Seth Rogen (whom you'd think is comfortable only in comedies) and a rich story with strong characterization delivered through what would be a strong ensemble cast, 50/50 gets my vote as being amongst one of the best films of the year. It's not flashy nor did it venture into sensationalism, but has this stoic confidence to tell it like it is, and rang through some really powerful and pure emotions without finding it necessary to employ clichés. Highly recommended!"

","50/50 is everything that Funny People was to suppose to be and more. A topic that has often been misplaced and under sold in Hollywood, cancer finds a suitable home in this film. The film successfully places a comical twist to the morbid topic and brings a suitable amount of drama as we witness the characters progress. I think the comical element was purposefully integrated in order to convey the laughable simplicity of life when our ends draw shockingly close. A phenomenal performance is brought by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, perhaps making it his best debut thus far. It is only fair to also add that the character chemistry between Rogen and Levitt exceed all expectations. 50/50 is the cure we have all been looking for."

"michael_the_nermal","6","1","4","28 November 2011"," Seth Rogen Makes a Passable Dramedy Unwatchable
","This will not be an unbiased review. Part of my dislike of this movie is based on what I consider to have been deceptive advertising. The commercials on TV sold this movie as something of an oxymoronic comedy: a dark subject, such as the protagonist having a potentially terminal form of cancer, would be tempered with low-brow comedy and witty humor. In the ultimate form of bait-and-switch, I got a depressing drama about a young man's struggle with a potentially terminal form of cancer, inter spliced with inappropriate ""humor"" courtesy of Seth Rogen.<br/><br/>How a movie makes one feel is irrelevant to its quality, but the fact I was expecting a dark comedy and got a tearjerker left me feeling empty and depressed. <br/><br/>I will say that Gordon-Levitt's role as the protagonist was decent. He didn't turn in a performance that was Oscar-worthy, but he was subtle, understated, and calm, which made the character very believable. He doesn't overact or react bizarrely. He is rather meek and mild-mannered, which allows the audience to empathize with the character, His acting is the best part of this movie.<br/><br/>To be candid, most of the actors do a superb job. The actress who played the therapist, the protagonist's mother, and the girlfriend are excellent. They're completely human, and a credit to the talent pool in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>...Then there's Seth Rogen, who seems completely out of place in this otherwise mild- mannered, understated drama. First of all: does this guy have to play the same damned character in every movie: a pudgy foul-mouthed, lazy, pushy, womanizing stoner who only lives for casual sex and weed? Rogen is not funny in this role. I don't know why he is always typecast in this role, as he isn't very good at it. His constant cursing and carousing bored me. He seemed more obnoxious than charming as the protagonist's friend. In short, Seth Rogen drags this movie down. He should really call his agent about getting roles other than as slackers: being cast as the voice of a Praying Mantis *is* a good start though.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who enjoy decent dramas. The acting is well done. Sadly, I wasn't in the mood for a depressing dramedy tonight, so I didn't walk out of the movie feeling high---unlike Seth Rogen's character in almost every movie he's in, who's always high."

","Knowing that this films main theme was to be cancer, I went to see it with an open mind, this is because I was diagnosed with cancer. Any film that has a theme of an illness finds itself having to make sure they don't upset a long list of people and organisations, these include: The people who suffer with the illness Relatives of the sufferer Medical Professionals Charities And the normal film goers I found that they did show how a person, who is diagnosed with cancer, can be effected by the news and not breakdown and follow the apparent 5 stages of grief. The film started off OK but after the first 10 minutes or so I felt that the film slowed down and for the next half an hour it was just about Kyle using Adams cancer to have as much sex as possible. I felt there was an unequal balance of Comedy and Sympathy and after the first hour and a quarter I, my daughter and others in the cinema were getting bored. The last twenty are good as they follow the operation but then the film ending with a patient having a relationship with their doctor was VERY WRONG AND VERY ILLEGAL."
"jtprius510","6","1","6","4 October 2011"," Another Bromantic Classic
","In terms of subject matter Director Jonathan Levine's 50/50 is similar to Funny People, minus the 45 minutes they take out to Monterey to see about Adam Sandler's married ex-girlfriend. Subtract that 45 minutes from Funny People and we would've had the pinnacle of comedic drama in what we know today as a bromantic comedy.<br/><br/>Besides Click, Funny People allowed Sandler to provoke an eye socket warming cathartic reaction. Now subtract Sandler's sense of humor from that movie along with the 45 minutes he takes aside from the most dramatic feature of the film, which altogether ruined Funny People's chances and you have Joseph Gordon-Levitt with Seth Rogen alongside as a 50/50 chance of landing somewhere closer to this type of comedic drama's intended goal.<br/><br/>By now since Inception, and 500 Days Of Summer, everyone likes Levitt enough to not only pay closer attention to such a complex illness, but to also empathize with his metamorphosis from a no license having health nut, to a balding thin medicinal marijuana smoking, cancer patient.<br/><br/>Rogen lends himself to this feature as merely a helping hand with just enough comedic quips and antidotes to help Levitt through this illness without letting the audience forget exactly what they are dealing with. The occupations of these characters take a sideline to this disease. Levitt's reaction to this illness is certainly something real enough to set things off with. Cinematically the trip his mind takes over the edibles and the chemotherapy is definitely something new introduced to this genre of bromantic comedies as it is also something enough to keep every one's attention.<br/><br/>Funny thing about these comedies that intertwine themselves with drama is how much it constitutes and dignifies what is basically a romantic comedy for bros. Other films of this genre are Along Came Polly, 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Funny People, etc. It must have been this type of feature that inspired movies like I Love You Man, movies like this years' 50/50. By leaving out the potty humor 50/50 is the closest this genre of bromantic comedy has gotten to what it has always lacked in subtlety. Something about this attempt at such a style is what makes me wonder where this type of comedy is headed.<br/><br/>As far as 50/50's release in theaters, I say see it, if you've already seen everything else that American cinema has to offer, from Drive, Moneyball, and Warrior. Otherwise it makes for a great date."

There were a few sad parts without being down right depressing. Friendship seems to be a big focus on this movie, you can't tell how much by the preview, but the message this movie portrays is something we all should live by. While the movie is about cancer, it looks at it in a completely different way. After the movie instead of feeling any type of emotion for the character all I could say was If I ever get cancer that's how I would want it to be!

","Summit Entertainment may be a successful studio, but Fly Me to the Moon is their most decent work. If there's anything about them I could observe by watching The Ghost Writer, it's that their interference tends to botch movies with massive potential. Sadly, 50/50 is no exception by a long shot.
The premise: a young man is diagnosed with cancer and is told that he might survive.
Cancer is without a doubt one of the most active diseases in movie history. So much so, that if anybody ever finds a cure, that person deserves the nobel prize.
To see somebody survive makes for a unique concept. Unfortunately, the studio's interference turns it into its average snooze fest. The cast members do their best to make themselves 3-dimensional, but Seth Rogen is the only one to shine, let alone be amusing. At least no careers are ruined."
"JakeBrinkman","7","0","1","1 September 2019"," The most realistic take on a cancer diagnosis
","This film sheds light on the confusing range of emotions experienced by a cancer patient, his friends, and his family. It also shows the struggle that all of them face to cope with the diagnosis, treatment, and risk of death. While 50/50 odds are fairly high for stage 3 or 4 cancer, I would still recommend this movie to anyone who is diagnosed or knows someone diagnosed with cancer.<br/><br/>All of the supporting cast perform their parts expertly, making it abudantly clear how the cancer diagnosis has affected them and their coping methods. Even the least likable character is still completely relatable as someone who feels stuck in a situation they didn't want to be in. Gordon-Levitt performs excellently, and it's very easy to imagine him as a real person, which compels the audience to sympathize with every one of the wide range of emotions that he experiences.<br/><br/>The realism makes this movie an excellent resource for anyone affected by a cancer diagnosis, though this same realism does hold it back from being a great drama by never presenting the emotional knock out punch that one would expect from a Hollywood drama. However, 50/50 still lands some solid punches and provides excellent life lessons."

","The second film in which Seth Rogen plays the sidekick of a guy who gets cancer, that being the drowsy FUNNY PEOPLE a few years back, and the second time is a charm. <br/><br/>Thanks to Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who shows the right amount of shocked melancholy while he suffers through chemotherapy, the prolonged breakup of his shallow girlfriend, and an impending surgery that could take his life, this is a lightweight take on a heavy subject that's both funny and emotionally satisfying. Rogen, as Levitt's buddy who realizes cancer is a great way to pick up on chicks, is a bit too forced into the comic relief department - almost every word spoken is meant for a laugh, and his character rarely gets an opportunity to shine past the caustic rants. Angelica Huston plays Levitt's neurotic mother, causing stress to her ailing son, but the real depth comes from his relationship with love interest Anna Kendrick as a hospital student shrink, first using Levitt as a case study but eventually - as the two bond outside the office - falling in love. Their relationship makes the movie work, while the buddy/buddy between Rogen and Levitt give routine breaks from the serious underbelly. <br/><br/>And as breezy soundtrack tunes provide an out before things get morose, and drugs (both medicinal and recreational) turn gloomy roads into shiny avenues way too easily, it's Levitt alone, whose character is brooding even before the diagnosis, that makes even the filler moments work: he really seems to be facing a grave future while trying to beat those 50/50 odds."

","Cue voice-over guy: ""In a world of ordinariness... Joseph Gorden-Levitt plays Adam: an ordinary guy with an ordinary job with an ordinary girl-friend and an ordinary life. All of this ordinariness collapses when he is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer and hilarity ensues.... That's the unpromising setup for Jonathon Levines 2011 film. Cancer is funny. Hmmm, not promising. Even less promising is the presence of Seth Rogan. Easily the most punch-able face in film. An actor with the range of a table and the charismatic appeal of genital warts. Even less promising.<br/><br/>So, what do we have here? Well, we have a slightly odd mix. Firstly, there's the boysy humour summed up by Adam's profoundly irritating best-mate (played by Rogan) who sees cancer as a terrific opportunity for a sympathy f**k... with hilarious consequences. Sigh. It doesn't work. Not because it's in poor taste. But because it isn't funny. In fact the film is at it's best when it's not trying to be funny. It portrays the social awkwardness of how people's reactions and responses change to a person diagnosed with the big C in all its awkwardness excellently and with great pathos.<br/><br/>Perhaps, unsurprisingly, as the director is using his own experience with the disease this is the heart of the film. Family, friends, partner and colleagues just don't know how to respond to or interact with Adam after his diagnosis and what follows is at times a touching portrayal of facing the mortality of yourself and others. In particular Adam's fractious relationship with Angelica Huston's fussy and over-protective mum will be ring bells with many grown men. The film almost derails itself with lazy depictions of the younger women who are a collection of caricatures: bitch girlfriend? Check. One-night-stand glamour bird? Check. Ditzy yet lovable medic? Check.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if you go in expecting big-laughs you'll be disappointed but there are some nuanced and poignant moments which resonate an air of truth which salvages this film into something of a success despite its obvious flaws."

He's spent his entire life trying to be safe and cautious, and now here he is, hit with extinction.<br/><br/>""50/50"" dodges most clichés, but indulges in some as well (far too many musical montages). Adam's relationship with Kendrick is cute, but also contrived and ends on a note of creepiness. Elsewhere Seth Rogen's character has little chemistry with Adam, a young man whose sensitive disposition seems at odds with Rogen's frat-boy bluster. At the same time, Rogen's presence lends the film an original tone: a mix between weepy melodrama and teen stoner comedy.

","I watched this movie as a fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, not entirely interested in the plot of the story as come on it's about cancer, that's a bit dark isn't it!? I was put off, thinking it would be too dreary or emotional for me and not the entertainment I look for in a film... I couldn't have been more wrong! I don't have a favourite genre, I like a bit of everything, but melodrama has got to be one of my least favourite, I would take comedy or action over it any day if given the choice. But this film is now in my all time top ten, not that you could exactly class it as melodrama, but that was the impression it gave me at first. It's got everything in it, Comedy, Drama, highs and lows. It's an emotional ride as it stays on a very serious plot line about cancer but remains funny while doing so and keeps you intrigued through great character stories played out with fantastic acting. Every person in the film delivers a ten out of ten performance with each part they play being vital to the story in whole. I could write a lot about this film as to why I liked it but I think that you should just watch it to find out for yourself as I don't want to give anything away apart from it's one of only a few films that managed to bring a tear to my eye. I would recommend it to anybody. The only reason I rated it 9 and not 10 is I dislike Seth Rogen, Don't ask me why, I just don't like the man I don't find him funny at all, however he is very strong in this and if I see him do more films like the part he played in 50/50 I may grow to change that opinion."

When he learned that Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is his girlfriend had been cheating him, he didn't care, and he fell in love again with Katherine (Anna Kendrick) who is a young therapist at the cancer center. Kyle (Seth Rogen) who is Adam's best friend supported him, and I have to say that I laughed so much to Kyle at the movie. Relation between Adam and his mother was also told at this movie, and it is one of interesting things to me. I watched the movie without boring, for we can see this situation in our daily lives. I can imagine it, so I can understand Adam's situation, and I can comment about it. By the way, this movie isn't histrionics. Because it tells a real situation with a real viewpoint.

","50-50 is one of the most attractive film which I have watched lately. I always like about reality of life.It is a feel-good and slightly comedy-drama about a young man's fight against cancer, aims to put a tear in your eye if not for long. No matter how healthy, whoever you are no one knows what will happen after a few hours. At times, scenes surrounding these larger topical issues will make you laugh and cry. And they'll do it without crafting you with telegraphed beats or forced catharsis. This film is as real as facing this situation gets. Also, it is entertaining and watchable, despite its fantasy world delineations and over simplification.If you want to smile, feel sad, see sincere actress I advice you to watch this film. In spite of everything and every adversity, this film showed us how important it is to fight, hope and cling to life."

","50/50 is a bittersweet movie. I love drama films that make me feel the reality, and this film is one of them, but it also includes comedy. The reason of that I was not bored while I was watching it is due to the fact that not only includes drama and comedy but also the cast is capable. Especially, I like acting of Joseph Gordon-Levitt who is the main character in the film. First message that film tries to give is that if you are sick, especially cancer, try to do anything that you have not done yet instead of waiting for death, so this is the feature that distinguishes this film from other films. The second message is that a real friend never leaves you alone in the worst day. All in all, the film is worth watching. My point is 8/10."

Amazing performances are shown The story of the film feels believable and real, basically because it's based on the real experience of normal human in real life. The strength of the movie is that the film is supposed to be sad because of cancer but it is very positively processing cancer and other abandonment of his dear. I think everything in the film is in right amount The film's only real weakness can be found in the girlfriend and mother characters. Howard and Huston give the roles their best efforts, but both of them are stuck with stereotypical and predictable character arcs. . It is a film which is awarded many prizes like audience award in aspen filmfest, Hollywood breakthrough award in Hollywood film festival and it is nominated in many film awards. and if there's a message to the movie it's that laughter really is the best medicine"

","Well..that's quite impressive for those who want to watch a nice film apart from just watch something in a boring weekend. What Im thinking about the film is exactly a complex idea as i have just watched it and i liked very much. So there are lots of thinks in my mind actually to say about this film. First, what it is aimed to quote to people who watch this film is the conflict which is possible for everyone to face with one day. In such a situation, it is quite vital to look around and determine what to do.After watching that movie, something which was in my mind already came into question again, İ mean a person who having such difficulty like seen in the film should not abandon struggling. Every difficulty we face with during our life is actually a key for us to understand whether we are aware of things happening around and ready for a new chance to start.."

","You're in a job you like, in denial about your struggling relationship, and you're not particularly close to your parents as your father is suffering from Alzheimer's and your mother is so much more emotional than you are that it's difficult to carry on a conversation with her. Then you get the news that changes your whole life. Is that the makings of a comedy? Will Reiser thought so and it's inspired by his life.<br/><br/>Adam Lerner (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a producer for public television whose live-in girlfriend Rachael (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) is a struggling artist. While they were not talking about it, it appears a break-up is inevitable. Adam's best friend Kyle (played by Seth Rogen) is urging him towards the door but Adam is unconvinced. Then, during a doctor's appointment he made to resolve back pains that wouldn't go away, he's given the news. He has a tumor on his spine and if he doesn't subject himself to chemotherapy and then surgery, he'll die. Kyle (Rogen) is determined to keep his friend in a positive mindset. Rachael (Howard) is given an out but doesn't take it and decides, instead, to remain with Adam and is supportive, at least at first. Meanwhile, his insurance also covers visits to a psychologist. That ends up being something of a double-edged sword as the in-house psychologist, Katherine McKay (played by Anna Kendrick), is very inexperienced.<br/><br/>This is the second film in just over two years to feature a comedic take on a serious illness and Seth Rogen in a significant role. The first being 2009's Funny People with Adam Sandler. Having seen both, I can say unequivocally that 50/50 is not just a better film, but a great film. There are solid performances from all the cast, an interesting story and a satisfying conclusion that doesn't appear too good to be true. See this immediately."

","Humor and tragedy are blended well. In 50-50 you will laugh, you will be sad or even will cry from time to time. It is a movie adapted from reality. Director of the movie reflects the reality well. Most movie's directors whose movies I have watched about cancer or disease like that do not know how to reflect the disease of cancer. But Jonathan Levine succeeded in reflecting cancer to the film. Performers are very good with acting their roles. You will like Kyle's humors in high time, and you will be sad with Adam's terrible disease. Good dialogues among performers ease the understanding of idea. So writer of 50-50 had a good job. You will see yourself in the movie. It might be bad or good, but still you will. The most high time of supporting a person in his/her worst time but leaving his or her behind. You can see reality in every scenes of the movie. **(spoiler)** But there is a good ending in the movie as usual. Good endings are in almost every movie now. I was actually expecting a sad ending from the director. Anyway, good endings are good. So you should watch this movie at once. You will like it, too."

","I glanced through the other reviews on this movie and was surprised to find that no one had the same complaint as I am about to make. The commercial for 50/50 made it seem like Levitt was only pretending to have cancer in order to trick women into dating him. I had no idea that he actually has cancer in the movie until I watched it tonight. And boy does he have cancer!<br/><br/>A side note - I had a friend who's dad died of cancer around 1993. The friend, Misha, went to the video store to rent a movie to watch during the wake for some reason. She was recommended the movie ""My Life (1993)"" and brought it home not knowing anything about it. As you know, that movie is basically the same premise as 50/50, only VERY somber. Misha wept openly the whole rest of the day. Way to go Blockbuster!<br/><br/>So in summary, if you're going to watch a movie about cancer and you want to be overcome with emotion and tears and witness an astoundingly amazing movie, rent ""My Life"". If you want to laugh about cancer, rent 50/50."
"EyeEtsh","9","0","1","8 July 2012"," Brilliant movie. A story that will make you reconsider things. Amazing performances !
","The movie came as a surprise me in every aspect. I picked it up by chance and well, I love chance.<br/><br/>The movie is doubtlessly exquisite. It's somehow surprising to find a Comedy dealing with cancer without expressing some kind of disrespect to the sick people or banalising its graveness, but this movie does it almost perfectly. The movie is generally light and uplifting, with a fair amount of well-reckoned giggles, but at the same time very true and wistful at times, giving justice to anyone who had a real experience with cancer.<br/><br/>The story of the film feels believable and real, basically because it's based on the real experience of the scenarist. All of the characters are really human and none of them is disposable or superficial.<br/><br/>The strength of the movie stems from two sources : 1. The positive tone of the story : Although the movie is supposed to be sad and dark (A twenty-something getting an expectable cancer .. how sadder can it get ?), it turns out that the storyline takes a wholly different direction of events, turning the shock to a chance to live, and betrayal to a recovery experience. Simply put, the unexpectable positiveness of the story makes it absolutely worth watching. 2. Whilst the full cast is amazingly well chosen, the ever-close-to-perfection performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt took the spotlight, by far. The true, warm and hearty acting of the main man is THE secret ingredient of the success of this movie. Joe didn't only act out the character but embodied it in a way rarely seen nowadays. It even made me go back and watch other movies of his, and I wasn't disappointed, this man has it : Sheer talent, growing from one role to another, and blooming nice and clear in this portrayal. I was really angry when the freaking Academy didn't give him an Oscar nomination (it's not the first time Oscars disappoint me, but it felt more personal this once). Arguably, no other actor could've delivered this role the way Joseph Gordon-Levitt nailed it, thus I guess watching his pure talent overflowing in many iconic scenes is a reason by itself to watch the movie.<br/><br/>The bottom line ? If you want to see a story that will bring Hope and Joy back to your life, if you are going through any kind of hardships and you want a breeze of happiness, if you have or had someone who had cancer, or if you simply want a great story played by amazing actors, go fetch 50/50, and watch it, NOW."

","I had the pleasure to watch this at a sneak preview. I really enjoyed its quirkiness and it's mix of drama and comedy. Jonah Hill may seem to do his known sch-tick, but if you stick around, you'll see another side to that story/coin. And he brings emotion with the (sometimes vulgar) comedy bits.<br/><br/>Even the most unlovable character in this has something going for her. But you know what you are facing after the first few minutes. And if you like them, you will like the movie. Even if you think there are a few bumps along the ride (there are), the movie is more than worth it. One of the best films I've seen in 2012 so far. Sweet and dramatic, crass and soft and other things at once. And still manages to balance them out quite nicely."

","We saw this film in the class. I said to my self that this movie was going to be a comedy about cancer and I became skeptical. But the reviews then started coming in and were mostly positive. Everyone in the class have been silenced. The plot is that Adam has been diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer and has a 50% chance of survival, during his illness, he learns more about what he truly had and life. His best friend, played by the always funny Seth Rogen supports him along with his family and try to help him get through this. I think he is a best friend in world. Adams girl friend leaves him but his friend didn't leave him. Very few movies exist that made my heartache and nearly brought tears to my eyes from the sadness of what's going on, this is not one of them...because it breaks my heart and has me crying like crazy in the the last few minutes, not just me my friend mesut is also cried.

This is one of the few movies that made me really cry. The acting was super good. The most wonderful character in this movie was Anna Kendrick. She was very cute and acting very professionally. Another good part of the movie that it almost talked about all the problems a cancer patient may face. I mean all the social issues like increasing love, sympathy, people making use of the patient case, betrayal and loyal people. I recommend this movie for you if you like these types of movies. I rated it 10/10 and it does worth it.I really enjoyed the film. You can't make a comedy about cancer, or any other serious illness for that matter, and fail to produce a genuinely funny script. Laughs come often and organically.There are so many ways to do a comedy film about cancer wrong, but very few ways to do it right. 50/50 thankfully manages to find the sweet spot of this risky terrain and succeeds in being a charmingly touching film as well as a wildly hilarious one. It's always nice to be so surprised by a film's quality. I expected good things from 50/50 from the first time I saw a trailer, but the movie itself exceeded my expectations."
"meganhbn","10","0","1","24 May 2012"," Based on a true story, absolutely fantastic!
","This movie is fantastic! For those who are complaining about a comedy about cancer, how it is inappropriate, blah blah blah...they need to realize that Will Reiser who wrote this screenplay is a cancer survivor. He and Seth Rogan are real life friends and this movie is based on/inspired by their journey through Will's illness. So whoever wants to whine about it being inappropriate should eat their words.<br/><br/>This film is the story of a younger man struggling with cancer, how he deals with possibly facing death, and how his friends support him. It's an interesting take on a very serious subject, but I think it is very realistic and shows a different side that most movies involving illness like this are afraid to show. Adam grows as a person while going through something most people cannot even imagine and develops new friendships with fellow cancer patients, a flirtatious relationship with his therapist, and examines the other relationships in his life. <br/><br/>Anyway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is awesome in this film. Anna Kendrick is amazing. Seth Rogan is hilarious, as always. I absolutely recommend this movie. Its funny, its sad, its uplifting. Definitely a must-see!"

In addition to struggle his own emotion he has to calm his anxiety mother. Along the story losing his girlfriend is also depressing situation for him. In this film, there are many advice for us. This film gives us a sign of what cancer is like, how it can affect you and how it can destroy you if people let it. But it also teaches us to never give up. The best part of the movie for me is that Adam saw a book is related how can beat cancer at Kyle's home while he thought that his best friend ignored him.What a touchy! The acting was great, the characters were great and i loved it.this film is related to the real love, too. Because ,when the Adam's girlfriend heard the cancer, she broke up from him.

For example, his girlfriend broke up from him, then he meet with some problems with his best friend. But while the bad things is go on, some good things happened. For example, he meet the doctor.

My favorite scene was probably the one where Adam finds Kyle's book on helping someone who's going through an illness. The other favorite scene was the one, which Adam was shaving his head. On the other hand, while most of the people found the therapist-patient relationship not ethic, I liked the energy between them, it isn't violated in this film, I think.

","First of all, i want to say something about this film. It is patience. For me the main idea of the film is patience. Because he put up with the many problems. The most important one is his disease. Because cancer is so dangerous disease. Patient should be patient and his morale degree should be very high. In this film is really similar to the real life. Because first of all, there is no problem everything was good, but later there are some problems. For instance, the man who is cancer patient is so depressed when he learn his disease. But his friend and his doctor are really make an effort about himself. Thus,the main character of film, is not struggle to go on his life. By the way, i realize that when someone get ill the family or his friend is come up. In this film, when the man get ill his family came up. My idea is, sometimes bad things can be beneficial for us. The best scene in the film is, the man decline his girlfriend when she come to the his house. And she said that everything can be good next times. But the man declined her. Because she break up when she learn his disease. Real love is important."

But at the end of the patience, almost everything changes. And also in the film of 50/50 many thing changed. After got ill, he met the doctor. And he loved her.

After that, there are some events in the film. Also this film give an information about life. It is, everything can be change. One of the most important thing is determination. But sometimes, many of us struggle to endure against the problems. In this situation, family members or other friends help us. For example in this film, the man that is cancer patient give in the first time. But later, his best friend and the doctor support him about the never give up his expectation. In real life, it is so important. This film is so similar to real life or real situations. The other important point is, patience. For me, patience is the main idea of the 50/50. On the other hand, this film is related to the real love. Because , when the man's girlfriend heard the cancer, she broke up from the boyfriend. It is the other important point of real life. If you love someone, you should never give up in any case. That is why this film is really good. Everyone should watch it."

","Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the hero of Levine's new film, is dealing with a situation that's even more wack: At age 27, he's been diagnosed with an unpronounceable form of spinal cancer that gives him only a 50 percent chance of survival.Why doesn't he have a license? Is he fearful, or just broke?) Adam's hospital visits introduce him to a few sympathetic souls: There's Alan (Philip Baker Hall), a cancer patient in his 70s who generously shares his medical-marijuana-laced macaroons; and Katherine (Anna Kendrick), a nervous young psychology student who offers Adam therapy sessions as part of her thesis project.Levine and the scriptwriter, Will Reiser (who based the story in part on his own experience as a cancer patient), labor mightily to find both the drama and the comedy in Adam's awful plight, with a success rate that's slightly greater than the ratio of the film's title. Scene by scene, 50/50 can be both amusing and moving, with the tightly wound Gordon- Levitt and the boundaryless Rogen forming an oddly complementary pair. But as a whole the movie never quite coheres, seeming to skitter away at the last minute from both full-body laughter and full-body sobs. ""Did you see Terms of Endearment?"" Adam asks his mother moments before he tells her he has cancer. The line gets a laugh because, presumably, of the distance between that movie's Hollywood vision of a family brought closer by cancer and this movie's rawer, realer version. But the sprawling, occasionally operatic Terms of Endearment felt more honest than this cautious and tidy film."

","It's a good example of how your life can change in an hour.This movie was emotional in so many different ways.It may make you laugh and cry.It's a mixture of humor and drama.Well paced and great acting. Every actor did a fine job.Wonderful performance from the cast especially SethRogen and Levitt,their chemistry worked beautifully. I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I had expected to, considering the subject matter. The characters were able to inject a lighthearted humor into something most of us don't want to think about; regardless of how many people it affects in the world today. I enjoyed all of the performances, and thought it was great to see a number of actors and actresses that I really like together in this film.It's really worth watching."

","Seeing this movie reverted me back to when I saw '(500) Days of Summer,' and not just because Joesph Gordon-Leavitt headlines both. When I went to see 'Days,' my expectations were inflated because of all the buzz I had been hearing, which ultimately left mem a little disappointed when it didn't meet them. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the film, but I didn't fall in love with like everyone else. The same thing happened with this film, I enjoyed it for the most part, but still had my reservations.<br/><br/>I'll start with what I liked, mainly, Joseph Gordon-Leavitt. He really puts this film on his back and delivers a great performance. He's funny when he has to me, and believable when he's playing a dramatic role. The more I see him on screen, the more I'm convinced he's blossoming into one of the finest young actors of his generation. Anna Kendrick, who plays the naive therapist, really establishes great chemistry with JGL, and the two play off each other very well. Seth Rogen, while he really does just play Seth Rogen in every film, has his best role I've seen him in, meaning he is only he doses (one can only fathom so much Seth Rogen.) And the story, for the most part, is meaningful and realistic (the screenwriter based it on actual circumstances), never falling into Hollywood clichés and melodrama, which is refreshing.<br/><br/>As for my criticisms, I have a few. Too much of the film's humor relied on juvenile jokes. Maybe it has something to do with the film's serious material, but no one ever seems to have a problem with the constant sex-jokes, which grew old fast. Bryce Dallas Howard's character, the 'bad' girlfriend (what else?), didn't seem to move the story further and acted very one-dimensional. Her not being in the movie at all would of been a benefit, allowing more time for the growth between the otherwise interesting characters.<br/><br/>But the good outweighs the bad here, and it's an enjoyable, if not somewhat forgettable, little movie worth seeing if you have some free time.<br/><br/>7/10"

","""50/50"" is about Adam, a very health and safety conscious young man, who is diagnosed with a rare spinal cancer. He struggles with accepting his condition and fighting it. The acting in this film is fantastic. Joseph Gordon-Levitt adds a genuine quality to the movie that I find lacking in many other movies about health issues. Seth Rogen does a great job of adding humor in a way that makes sense and is welcomed. ""50/50"" is packed with emotions, from fear and anger to love and laughter, which helps portray the confusing situation that Adam is enduring. It is a heavy film that I wouldn't suggest watching if you're looking for mindless entertainment, but if you're looking for something with substance, ""50/50"" is perfect."
"RainDogJr","10","0","1","14 March 2012"," Overlooked gem; Joseph Gordon-Levitt is golden
","I had been intending to watch 50/50 since some time ago. I ordered the Blu-Ray from ebay, however before it arrived to my place the film finally opened in Mexico City theaters. I ended watching it on the big screen with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago, the day after the 2012 Academy Awards, to be exact. I usually don't care much about the Oscars -and its many injustices- but this time I was thinking a lot in the Oscar-worthy material from 50/50, especially since it was the day after having a film like Alexander Payne's THE DESCENDANTS in many of the important categories. <br/><br/>I think 50/50 and THE DESCENDANTS have many similarities with each other. For instance, they are two of the three 2011 films, that I have seen, with a character that suffers from Alzheimer's disease (the other being RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES). But aside of thematic similarities (there's the infidelity thing too, Hawaii is mentioned here and is the setting in the other, and of course the obvious one dealing with a character fighting for its life), they share what's most important: the great quality; especially the great quality of the main actor. If George Clooney's performance is, for many, overrated, then Joseph Gordon-Levitt's one is brutally overlooked for me. He is golden, portraying a young man (Adam) who has been diagnosed with a rare case of spinal cancer. Hell, I think I will remember more his performance than Clooney's. <br/><br/>But anyway, 50/50 deals with the cancer disease in ways I don't think we have seen before. We have the required, and nevertheless touching, parts, too. Like for instance, we have the part when Gordon-Levitt's character sort of realizes what's really going on, so he breaks down, which is absolutely understandable; the situation is familiar and pretty much required in films of this matter, and at the same time those are the kind of scenes that allow Gordon- Levitt to fully show his potential. And boy oh boy, he is REALLY GREAT. <br/><br/>It's a difficult film obviously, just as it makes you think in the terrible disease cancer is. Then for me this is also a rare case of a difficult picture that I can watch more than just one time. I mean, when a difficult/depressing film is great it is still difficult or depressing and you can't just easily watch it again like you would normally do with any other type of great film. Some people, like my girlfriend herself, will not want to revisit 50/50 even when they truly liked it. But I have seen it twice already and I plan to watch it again soon, now with my cousin since we both are huge fans of Seth Rogen and pals. <br/><br/>Having the writers of SUPERBAD (Rogen and Evan Goldberg) as producers of a film about cancer is certainly a complete surprise. Rogen, by the way, is also playing Gordon-Levitt's co- worker and best friend (Kyle), and is like a comeback for him: he is basically reprising his funny-guy-pot-smoker role, from movies like KNOCKED UP. His ""reprise"" is very much welcome, for my money.<br/><br/>And it's not only the thing of making jokes around cancer. There are jokes and they are real fun, with Rogen on fire; and nobody, by the way, can really bitch about that since the writer himself -Will Reiser- had (or still has, I don't really know) cancer. But together with the jokes and stuff it's also the thing of creating an environment of pure camaraderie. Believe me, as well as Rogen both Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer are superb and key factors playing two cancer patients who will share, amongst some other things, Bob Marley's old favorite with Adam and, of course, Kyle! The feminine cast is also quite good; let's not forget that we have a sweet performance from Anna Kendrick (in the most predictable subplot of the story), the extremely beautiful Bryce Dallas Howard and, surprisingly, Angelica Houston; damn, they even ""got some"" Pearl Jam (and some Bee Gees too)! You really have to check this one out. <br/><br/>*Watched it on February 27 and March 03, 2012 (Blu-Ray)."
"Robert_duder","7","0","1","21 February 2012"," A sad example of what comedy and film making is becoming
","I did not hate this movie. Parts of it were absolutely excellent. However the crude and literally movie spoiling existence of Seth Rogen takes a touching and potentially heart wrenching movie into complete and utter crud. I read other reviews or hear what people have to say about this movie and I'm very confused. I hear that people bawled, and cried and found it moving and touching and there are a few moments that might make you feel that way but it is completely overshadowed by the filth they put into the movie. The language is appalling. I'm not a prude, and I can handle just about anything in a movie but when you get a movie like this...a potentially moving story about a young man diagnosed with cancer and how he deals with it, falls out of love, in love, and living with his friends and family. That should have been enough but apparently the film makers thought they should take a PG movie and turn it into an R rated Seth Rogen comedy blitz because it would sell better.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a truly outstanding, brilliant performance as Adam, the twenty-something diagnosed with cancer. He gives an award worthy performance and again I have to say that what should have been an Oscar worthy performance is ruined by Rogen. The ironic thing is that Rogen, in real life, went through this with 50/50 creator Will Reiser. I guess you know what you're gonna get with Rogen but his character is annoying, stupid, unfunny, and of course absolutely disgusting and crude. He ruined this movie period. Anna Kendrick is good as the awkward and quiet new doctor trying to help Adam deal with his emotions. She has good chemistry with Gordon-Levitt and is charming. Bryce Dallas Howard is deliciously awful as Adam's girlfriend. She is just really a bad human being and you will love to hate her. This might be Howard's best role ever. I've never been a big fan but she plays bad really good. Anjelica Huston gives a solid performance as Adam's mother but they under-use her. I would have like to have seen more from her and more between her and Gordon-Levitt.<br/><br/>I think its downright hilarious that Rogen himself, a producer on the film, thinks that 50/50 makes people uncomfortable because its a comedy about cancer. I constantly hear how they tackled cancer in a way no one has ever done before and guess what...that's a load of crap. I have yet to see a movie about cancer that tip toes around it. 50/50 is not breaking any new ground here no matter what the majority of the film makers and some reviewers will tell you. Yes it has moments of being a sweet story and some really powerful moments. A scene with Gordon-Levitt where he locks himself in the car and basically melts down is really particularly powerful. But then when you're being barraged by sex and bad language through the rest of it, it wears thin and ruins what could have been a truly powerful movie. See for yourself and find out what side of the fence you fall on...artistic film making brilliance or potential for powerful ruined by nasty humour. 7/10"

","Short Version: I loved it! It was both heart-wrenchingly emotional as well as laugh-out-loud funny. I would recommend any person to watch this movie. <br/><br/>Long Version: It was almost flawless as both a comedy and a drama film, and managed to mix the two together quite nicely. The first thing I must say about this movie is that the acting is INCREDIBLE. I definitely expect some awards in these actors' futures! On the acting front, of course the leads (Joseph Gordon Levitt, Seth Rogen) did an amazing job, but the supporting cast was also amazing! In particular, Anjelica Houston stood out to me. She did an amazing job as Adam's mother in the film and must be recognized for going rather far from her type-cast (To be honest, I did not recognize her at first). Another supporting star was the gorgeous Anna Kendrick. Her role in this film was paramount. Anna did an excellent job as the ""newbie therapist""; She certainly brought a realness to the film. Other things that should be noted are the setting: Beautiful Seattle. Also, the writing in this script is phenomenal. Will Reiser did an incredible job of making the film fluent and smooth. It truly felt like I was watching a hilarious documentary about a terrible situation. I loved it!"
"galahad58-1","6","0","1","29 January 2012"," 50/50 Rating
","This film is a decent film, but I feel it is 50/50 whether you will like it or not. The film really doesn't get good until the last 15 minutes. The beginning of the film is a bore and the Seth Rogan F-bomb fest is too over the top. The scenes where the anesthesia personal take him from his mother and they put him on the OR table while not in the proper OR gear is ridiculous. As a cancer surviver I related to the Adam character. I had a girlfriend who told me that my cancer ""was intruding on her social life"" -- so I asked her to leave. So I know how it feels to have someone bail out on you. My mother (who was aloof most of my life) became overbearing during the whole process as did the character in the film. I related to the film, but because of the sexual nature of ""getting laid before I did"" and the f-bomb line after line did not make me feel as much for the character as I should have. The last scene was the final straw also. The total violation of the patient-caregiver role was the last Hollywood part that ruined the ending for me. It is not a bad film if you like more of a Hollywood feel than a real life feel. You also have to get by the f-bomb routine."

","but i read a few of the ones in the beginning and no one said some of the things i thought or felt, sooooo... it's the most fun I(emphasized) ever had with a cancer movie... and most of the time i felt guilty about feeling that way...which is interesting. i've been on both sides of serious medical, life changing events... as a health professional and in my personal life... and i think that what's MOST attractive about this film to people is that it's a rubbernecker's dream... we get to be a fly on the wall during the course of this person's cancer crisis. and that's a euphemism for a voyeur. we know, whether consciously or not, that WE don't have cancer. and we're being entertained AND scared. and it's STILL? not US! and i don't know HOW...but the whole movie i KNEW he wasn't going to die...it just didn't lend itself to that possibility on some subliminal level. tell me i'm not right... no one in Hollywood is going to lose money on what gets presented in the first 7/8ths because of what happens in the very last part. don't get me wrong. i had a good time with it. but that's my point. it was a bit TOO safe. the characters caricaturish/broad stroke.. but i never felt it went into the unrealistic area...i've seen all sorts of things happen in situations like this. so i wouldn't say there's any predicting specifics. tendencies, yes. specifics, no... so they just roller coastered us through... what a fun ride... ooooooooooh! THAT was scary... wow! THAT was fun... THIS is awkward. but now it's fun again... emotional ping pong well played...<br/><br/>and while some people criticized rogen's character as being TOO one dimensional(and an uncaring, walking penis. maybe not QUITE in those words, though), a)you must've grown up somewhere other than a city... b)HIS way of coping was by doing JUST the opposite of dying...it was having sex. it's how LOTS of people attempt to balance out the pain and anxiety in their lives...it wasn't that he didn't CARE... we get to see all this when Joseph's character crash's at rogen's character's place and he finds the book about all doing the cancer together... i could feel the room get warm and fuzzy at that moment... you know the movie 'terms of endearment'?"

","Cancer is probably the most egregious of all diseases. Once the doctor proclaims those doomed words, it becomes a sword hanging over your head with the rope getting burnt every minute. That leads to redemption, as shown in movies, and acts as a catharsis; I vent to let it all out, now that you know that the clock is going to chime soon. This theme has been frequently exploited by films. Hindi movies like Anand did it, Japanese ones like Ikiru has been there too. Heck, even Hollywood served it through Funny People, The Bucket List and a plethora of others. And then came 50/50. <br/><br/>Staking someone's chances of survival or death at 50/50 is the worst thing you could do to a dying man. At 90/10 he knows he is a goner. At 60/40, he still knows he is a goner. But at 50/50, he will only be a goner if lady-luck decides to screw him. And that glimmer of hope, is torture most unbearable. Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a twenty-seven year-old, who does things every twenty-seven year-old is expected to do - jog, not smoke or drink, obey traffic rules, not force his girlfriend into having intercourse and work honestly. Does any of that look like a cause for cancer? Hence, it comes as a bolt from the blue for him, when a rather sadistic, heartless wretch of a doctor blurts out in the most unsubtle way imaginable 'It's a malignant tumour.' Blur out, start music, life in slo-mo - Adam walking through the crowd in a daze, Adam reading about neurofibrosarcoma schwannoma online, Adam travelling in a bus staring outside the window and Adam breaking the news to his girlfriend - end music. He then tells about it to his closest, and apparently only, friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) who reacts by saying that he wants to throw up. Finally, he tells his paranoid mother, who has enough on her plate managing her husband who suffers from Alzheimer's. <br/><br/>Adam then enters mental therapy with a twenty-four year-old nearly-a- doc, Katherine (Anna Kendrick). He makes new friends at the cancer centre, takes drugs for the first time, shaves his head entirely, and learns to cope with life with the help of Kyle, who constantly insists on him getting laid, along with coping with the pain of his girlfriend cheating on him and them breaking up, before finally undergoing a make- it or break-it surgery. <br/><br/>Here is a a problem with that story - it is predictable. The idea, per se, isn't bold or daringly original - it is used, hackneyed and washed up. If you want to impress your new girl by predicting the future, you should take her to the film and keep saying what is likely to happen next, because it does happen that way. Even with the look in her eyes, you know Adam's girlfriend is going to break up sooner or later. Judging by the relation between the two, you know that Adam and Katherine are sooner or later going to have something between them (Dying Young, anyone?). You know Adam is going to do things he has never done before - like taking drugs, driving a car or burning a painting. Adam makes two friends at the cancer centre, and you know that someone is going to die. These aren't spoilers; these are events that you know are indubitably going to occur in the film. <br/><br/>But, here is the worst of all - the tagline of the film, as it proudly proclaims on the poster, is 'It takes a pair to beat the odds.' Past this point, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what happens in the end. <br/><br/>If you forgive the movie for that not-so-little-blunder it does make a rather enjoyable and emotional watch. By making the character of Adam so morose, pitiful and submissive even, it justs makes you want him not to die, which creates an emotional attachment between the viewers and the protagonist; a must for a film of this genre. He is a good man, but cancer has the tendency of always picking the good guys. The film brings forth a plethora of sentimental moments, that thankfully aren't mawkish - the way he responds to the doc's cold-hearted tumour statement, portraying the initial impression of mocking disbelief, but you can see the smile fading as the doctor pronounces his death like a radio broadcast, Adam learning about his girlfriend's betrayal, him being wheeled in for surgery after longingly hugging his mother - all deeply touching and heart-rendering, especially so because Adam doesn't deserve it. <br/><br/>What is interesting is the interplay of colours imposed in the movie. The colour scheme of each scene varies with Adam's emotions. The screen has yellow as the dominant colour when Adam tells about his condition to his girlfriend and mother. It is white and bright when Adam is relatively happy, when with Katherine and in the company of Kyle. The palette changes to a darker shade of yellow when he is alone and depressed. These subtle changes, are not only wonderfully done, but also elevate the feeling of morbidity and joy. <br/><br/>The background track, despite being used infrequently, works wonders for the movie. It plays a role similar to the colours, and strikes a resonating chord. Both the lead performances are adroitly delivered - Adam as the morbid cancer-inflict and Kyle as the ebullient friend-in- need. It is heartening to see Kyle maturing from a get-drunk-get-laid guy to a person who cares, drives his friend to the hospital and reads 'Facing Cancer Together.' In a similar way, it his heartening to see Adam smile through his pain and sorrows. Sadly, 50/50 adds plenty of characters that serve no major purpose whatsoever, instead of leaving it as just an Adam-and-Kyle show."

But I also liked Anna Kendrick who plays a therapist who is a little confused. Well this is a pretty serious movie.

","Once you start thinking about it, it's quite amazing how few cancer related movies there are. Isn't it like 1 out 4 people gets cancer at a point during his life? In other words, everybody is effected by the disease now days, whether it is as a patient or as a relative- or close one. Everybody knows probably at least 1 person who had been diagnosed with cancer and chances are you lost a relative or loved one by the disease already. So with all the dramatic movies about the strangest diseases and conditions in the world; how come so few of them are about cancer? Sure, there are plenty of movies in which a character is suffering or dies from cancer but there are so few movies which chronicles entirely the life of a cancer patient, from the first diagnosis till his/hers death or cure.<br/><br/>It's almost like there is still a taboo on the subject, though a more plausible explanation would perhaps be that it's hard to come up with a gripping and original story, that doesn't become melodramatic or extremely predictable. And this movie does cleverly avoid all of the clichés by not going for an all dramatic approach to its subject.<br/><br/>It's probably true that this movie is not emotional as heavy or effective as it could had been but that's OK. I prefer a honest movie above a melodramatic one anyway. And this movie does feel like a very honest and straightforward one. The movie shows it's not all crying and pain when you have cancer but there is also still room for laughter and plenty of other emotions.<br/><br/>And this is where the movie its greatest strength lies really. Yes, it's above all things still a drama but with a warm and comedic twist to it as well. The blend of drama and comedy might sound unusual, especially when considering its subject but it works out really well for the movie. It makes the movie feel incredibly sincere about its subject, without ever becoming a too heavy one, though at the same time you could still say its a bit of a tearjerker, which should mostly come from the fact that lots of moments in this movie should be recognizable, in one way or another, for some people.<br/><br/>What I also loved about the movie was how unpredictable it was. The story doesn't really progress in the way you would think. As a matter of fact, once you start thinking about it, the movie is hardly about the cancer itself really. The movie doesn't show or tell you all that much about the development or potential dangers and side-effects of the disease but its focusing way more on all of its characters and how they are coping with it all.<br/><br/>The approach this movie is taking is just great and refreshingly original. It's a really good job by director Jonathan Levine and writer Will Reiser. You can tell director Jonathan Levine has an history in short and independent film-making, which gives the movie the right required tone, approach, pacing and overall atmosphere, which all of the actors and their characters also truly benefit from.<br/><br/>The characters all truly feel like some really realistic ones. They are some everyday persons, being faced by something horrible, which they are all dealing with in their own way. The one is too worried and overprotective, the other just doesn't know how to handle it, while the other is using it to pick up some girls with. It's this diversity that makes this a very warm, honest, rich and colorful movie.<br/><br/>And I really wish I would have a friend like Seth Rogen's character, if I ever got diagnosed with cancer. His character is perhaps the biggest surprise of the movie. The biggest surprise because it actually works out! You would think his humor and antics would be out of place in this movie but it adds really a lot to it. Yes, Seth Rogen is great in this but so it the rest of the cast really! It might earn the movie some Oscar-nods perhaps.<br/><br/>One of this year's greats!<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","50/50 was not what I expected it to be. It's not a great film, but it definitely wasn't cloying with sentimentality very much. In fact, there is music, but many times the film's most dramatic moments play out without music, and they also ring true. I do have to say, the film did a great job of balancing the humor and the more serious drama. I wasn't sure how it would do it, but it did it very well. It is not a comedy before a drama, but it isn't a drama first either. Both aspects are handled equal to each other, and sorry for the pun, 50/50.<br/><br/>The screenplay is pretty well written, and there are a lot of great scenes in this. The cast only helps it. Bryce Dallas Howard is here yet again playing another unlikable bitch, but I mean she does it very well. But thing is, you want to like her, but ultimately she lets you down. Basically how Levitt felt. Anna Kendrick was sweet, and she captured her character well, despite being similar to her in Up in the Air. Seth Rogen started off annoying me, but I mean, he rises above with a good script (as was evident in Observe and Report). He also becomes very likable. The main reason to see this is for Levitt. This is definitely his best performance so far. In the film most serious scenes, he is fantastic, and he is the one swaying your your emotions.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good film, and an example of how to make something memorable from this subject matter and still appeal to the mainstream."

","This movie is a drama/comedy (a dramady if you will) about a 27 year old man, named Adam, battling cancer. On the surface, I expected something similar to ""Funny People""; funny moments here and there, a lot of forced jokes and drama, and a relatively thin storyline. That is not at all the case for ""50/50"". I have seen dramadies attempted before and the only other movie that successfully balanced the comedy and drama while having them reflect off each other was ""Little Miss Sunshine"". This movie makes us laugh because it is not afraid to point out the irony of cancer while also giving us healthy doses of the pain that Adam is going through. No scene is unnecessary or overdone in this movie, Will Reiser went through almost everything we see in this movie and even before I read that in the trivia section, I felt that from every angle. The directing was very organized especially when Adam finds out that he has cancer; after the doctor says ""Cancer"" everything goes blurry for Adam because that is all he hears and right away, the audience knows that all he is thinking about is the life he might not get to lead. The pacing is detailed and very precise at when to slow down or place emphasis on a character or situation. Lastly, the acting was phenomenal, especially from Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He does a sensational job in this film with displaying how alone and scared his character is in this situation without overdoing either side. The most powerful part is the night before Adam goes into his surgery and he is having a nervous breakdown in the car. When he calls his therapist and lists all the things he hasn't done yet, that was when I started crying (which is a rarity for me). This was a very well put together cast and a very well put together movie. If it doesn't get an Oscar (especially for Joseph Gordon-Levitt), then the Oscars have no taste!"
"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","0","1","26 October 2011"," Who knew cancer could be so entertaining?
","Fat Man is now a big fat Texan. I saw this at my local THIRTY-PLEX. Thirty screens! Big ones too. It's Texas after all.<br/><br/>Anything can be a comedy these days, even (supposedly) movies about sewing people stem to stern. The subject matter didn't really give me pause, it was more the nature of the film – quirky indie comedy/drama with wide release, mostly unknown writer and director, Anna Kendrick and Seth Rogen. I do love Joseph Gordon-Levitt and he was the driving force for looking past all these other items. Funny thing was, it did play out like a great indie film and both the knowns and unknowns performed marvelously. I'll get in to that in another paragraph.<br/><br/>The movie starts with cautious, nice-guy Adam (Gordon-Levitt) going through the daily gyrations (or not) with girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) and best friend Kyle (Rogen). His persistent back pain turns out to be cancer and makes every hypochondriac in the audience squirm in their seat. After that, there's not a lot of action but lots of self-doubt, poor behavior, and crying and crying and crying. I won't ruin the ending, but it's a little bit of a cliff-hanger to the end. Other than some of the oddities, there's nothing particularly outstanding about the story other than the nicely crafted dialog.<br/><br/>I didn't hate Anna Kendrick (Katherine) nearly as much as I thought. She wasn't so. herself in this movie, thanks goodness. Same for Seth Rogen. After the mess of Green Hornet, I realized he's like a lot of actors – they need direction. Give him the right words, and he's amazing. Let him write them and it's really not the same. Speaking of, Will Reiser's script was great. He crafted each character to be consistent, show some growth, and act like a real person. By the end of the movie, you really care about what's going to happen to Adam, you think his girlfriend is a waste of meat, and this whole situation just sucks. Reiser also managed to finish the film strongly. Most movies can be great for the first 2/3, but fall flat in the last act. The emotions continue to build as Adam goes through the stages of dealing with cancer. Maybe it was the fact that this story already had a real life ending, but Reiser definitely had a goal in mind when the film started.<br/><br/>Jonathan Levine has come a long way from All the Boys Love Mandy Lane and really impressed me with 50/50. While some of the acting is less than convincing, the story, characters, and technical aspects made it very enjoyable."
"EUyeshima","8","0","1","26 October 2011"," Slyly Comic and Ultimately Poignant Take on the Dreaded ""Cancer"" Film
","Believe it or not, I wanted to see this movie based on just one line I heard in the trailer. Anna Kendrick's openly naïve therapist character says it to Adam Lerner, the cancer-stricken, 27-year-old protagonist played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - ""You can't change your situation. The only thing you can change is how you deal with the situation."" It's a predictable bromide but one that spoke to me at that very moment since I just got laid off from my job the day prior. Facing life's unexpected twists is what this 2011 dramedy is about, and director Jonathan Levine and screenwriter Will Reiser find a poignant, funny and off-kilter way of handling a standard Lifetime TV-movie subject without losing respect for the characters. The film tows a fine line dramatically, but perhaps because Reiser has first-hand knowledge of spinal cancer from his own personal experience, the story doesn't lose its footing.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Adam, a Seattle-based NPR staffer whose comfortable life is turned upside down when he learns he has malignant tumors along his spine. With little empathy, the oncologist tells him he has a 50/50 chance of survival. Buoyed by his boisterous best friend Kyle, Adam tries to remain optimistic despite his overbearing mother Diane, who wants to move in with him right away despite acting as a caretaker for his father, an Alzheimer's victim. Remaining disturbingly distant is Adam's artist girlfriend Rachael who promises to stand by him and nurse him back to health. However, as he goes through his chemotherapy, her commitment to him unravels. The movie addresses the bitter irony of how those one would expect support Adam without condition are the ones who are the most likely to fail. At the same time, he grows closer to two fellow cancer patients, as well as Katherine, the awkward young therapist who utters the line that rings so true for Adam.<br/><br/>The acting is effective without excess. As a last-minute replacement for James McAvoy (""X-Men: First Class""), Gordon-Levitt gives a nice, self-effacing performance as Adam that feels right for the passivity needed for the role. Playing a version of his real self since he is Reiser's best buddy and the one who encouraged him to write the script, Seth Rogen provides manic, shaggy-dog energy to Kyle as a direct counterpoint to Adam and then surprises by deepening his character as the story progresses. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Rachael as a more subtle version of the malevolent character she played in ""The Help"", but she may be in danger of stereotyping herself in like-minded roles. Kendrick also plays a variation of a previous role as the ambitious careerist in ""Up in the Air"", but she does a better job of transcending her character's youthful exuberance this time. Easily stealing her few scenes, Anjelica Huston brings back her much-missed ferocity to Diane. Unlike most, this is a most worthwhile ""cancer"" movie."
"Quinoa1984","10","0","2","18 October 2011"," a genuine surprise
","FAR exceeded expectations. May even be one of my favorite films of the year - combines some of the comedy one might expect from the Rogen/Goldberg camp, but with really surprisingly strong drama that is carried a lot by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, one of the most reliably strong actors of his age (which is pretty close to mine). Jonathan Levine takes a very personal story by Will Reiser, who had his own cancer story, and doesn't do too much to make it overtly funny or melodramatic. <br/><br/>Like his previous film The Wackness, he knows when to add a little style (when Adam takes his first weed in a while at the hospital, the world around him is in a fog, but he's so glad to be alive even when he sees a dead body go by he laughs), and then he knows when to just let the actors take the scenes where they need to go. Everyone feels like real people, which seems to be a rare commodity coming out of Hollywood, though a strength is that it doesn't feel like it's been touched by a lot of hands or committees. <br/><br/>In fact, this is the movie I was hoping for out of Funny People, the Apatow film from a couple of years ago which also had Rogen as the buddy of a guy suffering from a possibly deathly ailment and going through some serious existential business. Here the stakes are really felt since the lead guy, and most around him save for one big exception are good people who want to do right and sometimes just find it so hard (Bryce Dallas Howard's cheating girlfriend, who still feels human even as the closest thing to this film's antagonist). <br/><br/>In short - a film that's funny when it wants to be (and is), and is genuinely sad and heartfelt when it must be, with especially Levitt and Huston pulling their weight as top tier talent (though Rogen and Kendrick do their fare share too). 50/50 is that little dramedy which could really make an impact on the people who won't feel shy or turn away from what's been advertised solely as a ""cancer comedy"", which is not entirely accurate."
"crimsonking58","8","0","1","18 October 2011"," Relatable characters lead to heartfelt drama
","One might think that the cancer drama is about worn out by now. I went in expecting a comedy with some soulless drama about cancer on top of it that no one would really care about. Boy was I surprised.<br/><br/>What separates 50/50 from the sea of cancer dramas is the characters and their depth. These aren't fake feeling people caught in the prime of their life with something as awful as cancer, nor are they miserable people caught with another misery. The main character is just your everyday guy, average in just about every regard (but not to a boring extent), which is what makes the film so effective. I felt, and believe that others may feel, that his experience is similar to what would happen to me if I had cancer. I've never cried because of a movie, but this one certainly got me close.<br/><br/>Beyond the main character, the supporting cast is excellent. The love interests are very different, the parents are definite characters, and the stoned old folks are great fun. Seth Rogen is his usual self, but he isn't too invasive or unrealistic most of the time. All of the acting was stellar across the board, and very diverse. Joseph Gordon-Levitt won at least one fan with this movie, from his introspective stare and subtle worry to his final outburst the night before his surgery. We all saw it coming, but never with such passion or raw emotion.<br/><br/>The comedy elements bring the characters to life, and along with these the soundtrack provides the mood of the film as a whole. Some fantastic visuals where necessary (upon first hearing the word cancer stuck out to me, in particular) and perfectly restrained where it should be.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this to anyone who has a soul and can take a raunchy joke every once and a while. It's not life changing, but it is the most effective drama I've seen in a long time."

I'd be 100% sure if, once again, the screenwriter hadn't decided the plot, cast and dialogue wouldn't be enough entertainment and so threw in a bunch of superfluous explicit sex talk. Other than that, this is a heart-tugging film that will leave you caring for the people in it and hoping for things to turn out the way you'd want them to. The topic of cancer, the treatment of that topic, the responses to the cancer will resonate for those who have either gone through it, known someone who has, or is involved with someone who is currently there. The emotions are honest and compelling. This is one of the movies where the time flies by so fast you won't realize how long you've been a part of their lives...because you will be sharing many of the feelings exposed in this movie.

"TheUnknown837-1","9","0","1","12 October 2011"," It charges into a devilishly tricky frontier (melding drama with comedy, with a serious subject attached) and comes out virtually scar-less
","I had a fair deal of doubts and suspicions walking into ""50/50"" because I knew that the territory it was delving into is a devilishly tricky and uncertain one: taking a subject as serious and relevant as cancer and using it as the groundwork for a movie that is half-comedy, half-drama. To be honest, a couple of times, it did reaffirm some of my pre-screening doubts. An early-on joke about Patrick Swayze, in particular, I felt crossed the line and sparked a burst of anger in me. However, apart from my few qualms and some uneven twists in the picture, ""50/50"" turned out to be quite a special little movie. And although it charged into that dangerous, borderline-taboo territory so boldly, it came out on the other side with virtually no scars to speak of.<br/><br/>The movie was meant to be taken as a pure comedy in its opening sequence and it was here that I found my gripes. The way it treats the diagnosis of the main character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the early-on interactions between him and Seth Roger, were playing jokes with the subject of cancer and cancer patients, I felt, a little too brazenly. Virtually all of us have, at some point in our lives, met or known somebody ill with cancer. I am no exception and therefore a couple of the gags made me feel upset as opposed to amused. But that was early on, all contained within the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>After that point, ""50/50"" wields its dual-genre identity with astonishing deftness. My apprehensions were crushed as Mr. Rogen, as Mr. Gorden-Levitt's lifelong friend, helped him to try and live a little more before his untimely fate, whatever it may be, should roll around. The squeamish relationship between the protagonist and Bryce Dallas Howard at the beginning later turns out to be squeamish for a reason, as it opens up doors for a far more interesting, if predictable, dynamic. The said dynamic being between Mr. Gordon-Levitt as the cancer patient and an up-and-coming starlet named Anna Kendrick, as his counselor. I'll admit it, the outcome of their dynamic is by no means unexpected; anybody even remotely familiar with romantic comedies can see it coming from the word go. But the sharp writing and the charisma by the two talents involved make up for it and their relationship, I happily confess, is one of the more involving elements of the picture.<br/><br/>The picture's dramatic architecture becomes surprisingly powerful, very close to (what I consider the pinnacle of movies dealing with the subject of cancer and life and death) Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru."" But it melds this magnificently with its sense of humor. And it accomplishes this, after the opening third, by making jokes about things that you might otherwise expect to be from a movie devoid of a deadly disease twisting the plot. Mr. Gordon-Levitt and Mr. Rogen make a great comical combination and share a number of humorous moments together, the biggest laugh being one where they take out their anger upon a canvas painted by an ex-girlfriend and then proclaim they ought to hang it back up, now that it's deformed and full of holes. Other great moments center around Matt Frewer and the late Philip Baker Hall as a group of elderly cancer patients, who ease the pain of their disease by cracking some jokes about it. Jokes that you would expect a cancer patient to make. And that is the key to where the movie can pull gags with its sensitive subject and succeed.<br/><br/>""50/50"" is not without its faults. Apart from some iffy, insensitive jokes toward the beginning, the movie's photography by Terry Stacey is not Academy Award-worthy. The interiors are too gloomy and the exteriors are so soft it made me wonder if the cameramen ever heard of white balance. Anjelica Huston, as the patient's mother, frets too much before she even has a reason to fret about, and does not, until the very end, fulfill the dynamic the screenwriters obviously intended. It seemed more superficial to me than dramatic. And the pointless sex (oh, the pointless sex scene! How many times have we seen thee!)...well, I think I've repeated my opinion on that more than enough times in recent years. But in the end, the movie does come across with enormous sweeps of dramatic power and bombastic explosions of gut-busting humor, perfectly melding them together so that we laugh when we're meant to laugh and cry when we're meant to cry. As 2011 comes closer to an end, and the credits of ""50/50"" started to roll, I sat there in the theater thinking to myself: ""Maybe this won't have been such a bad year, after all."""

His girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard – ""The Help"" & daughter to Ron Howard) is a self- absorbed abstract artist. When Adam is diagnosed with spinal cancer, she puts on a show of caring, but is otherwise distracted. Adam's best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen – ""Pinapple Express"", ""Knocked Up"") takes a different view of his buddy's situation – it's babe candy.<br/><br/>Adam goes to neophyte psychologist Katherine (Anna Kendrick – ""Twilight"", ""Scott Pilgrim"") for counseling. She is awkward and inexperienced but earnest in her concern for Adam. Adam is also smothered by his doting mother (Anjelica Huston – ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"") who is caring for his father (Serge Houde). The stage is set and we're off The previews for this movie make it look like ""The Hangover"" but with cancer. But it is more. It's a true-life-inspired story about a young man (Adam) who is facing life-threatening cancer. It's approached with a sense of humor and sensitivity. We meet Adam, who is just getting started in life. He eats right, obeys all the rules (he doesn't even cross against a street light despite there being no traffic), and still receives the devastating news that he could die from cancer. The irony is he never learned to drive because it is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States.<br/><br/>Adam is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a very straight manner. We learn that he is a very giving, even forgiving man. Perhaps too much so as he has become a doormat for all the women in his life.<br/><br/>His best friend, Kyle, is played by Seth Rogen who is the obvious comic relief. Kyle seems to be an odds maker and when he learns that Adam's chances of Kyle can think of nothing more than getting laid and sees Adam's cancer as a way of improving their odds. <br/><br/>Both actors bring an honesty to their roles that is palpable. The film is less about cancer and more about how people respond to responsibility. We see the girlfriend who just goes through the motions. The mother who (already overwhelmed with taking care of her Alzheimer's husband) wants to move in. The best friend who relates to his buddy the only way he knows how – to get laid.<br/><br/>For a heartwarming story, told with sympathy and humor, I recommend you ""see it in theaters."""
"Hellmant","9","0","2","6 October 2011"," A cancer film that's actually fifty percent drama and fifty percent comedy!
","'50/50': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A cancer film that's actually fifty percent drama and fifty percent comedy. The film deals with the very serious subject matter of a 27 year old who is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, which he has about a fifty percent chance of beating. The movie takes a very honest and brutal look at his struggles to fight the illness as well as taking a lighter look at his best friend's attempts to help him overcome depression through positive thinking and having fun. The best friend is played by Seth Rogen and the movie is in fact based on one of his best friend's, a writing buddy named Will Reiser (who wrote the script), and his actual experiences overcoming cancer. Seth Rogen basically plays himself in the film and Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the Reiser character. The film is directed by Jonathan Levine and Levine does an outstanding job of balancing the depressing drama with light hearted comedy. Something really special results from it. <br/><br/>The movie does a very impressive job of balancing several different elements and angles to it's story. The biggest of which is the buddy story involving the two leads (Adam and Kyle). Rogen (Kyle) really shines here by showing how important it is to have a good friend like him in a time like that. There's also a bitter relationship story involving Adam and his self centered morally deprived girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard). Howard shows how important it is to make sure you have a good romantic companion by your side not like her character in a time like that. There's a blooming relationship story between Adam and a possible romantic interest he finds in his psychologist named Katherine (Anna Kendrick). Kendrick plays her usual type of role here and continues to do an adequate job with it. She of course shows the importance of the possibilities of real love. There's also the friendships Adam forms with other cancer patients at the hospital with him, specifically Mitch (Matt Frewer) and Alan (Philip Baker Hall), which shows how important it is to have people close that know (and can relate to) what you're going through. And there's the relationship Adam has with his overbearing mother (Anjelica Huston) and Alzheimer's stricken father (Serge Houde). They of course show the importance of family. All of these elements and performances are well played out but it's Gordon-Levitt that knocks it out of the park with his Oscar nomination worthy performance.<br/><br/>Like all really good movies the film has a lot to offer and there's very little to complain about. Some have shown disgust in the idea of a film that would try to take a comedic slapstick approach to such serious and dreary subject matter but there really isn't any slapstick here. The comedy depicted in the film all feels pretty real and genuine and being that it's based on the lives of the writer and actor I'd say it's probably pretty honest and heartfelt too. There's true passion in this film and I don't think anyone involved thought of it as a joke. I think the best way to deal with any of life's ugliness is to look at the good that comes with it as well. I don't think the dozens of sappy tearjerkers we've seen about cancer in the past have done an adequate job of really dealing with the subject matter. This film actually deals with it and life through all of it's ups and downs. It is an emotional roller coaster and a tearjerker as well. It definitely got to me in a couple places. I think this is the best type of cancer film and I applaud it's courage and originality.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s7ci6l5gkI"
"Jackpollins","Null","0","1","8 October 2011"," Definitely not a split decision on 50/50
","50/50 is a comedy about cancer. Yes, now breathe that in for a second. It has Seth Rogen, an actor mostly known for playing a wacky party dude (as he does in this film) and it's supposed to make you laugh. 50/50 is also, by every stretch of my imagination, a masterpiece. It is a film with everything right about it and nothing wrong about. The person with cancer is not Kyle (Rogen), the wacky party dude, but his friend, Adam (Joseph Gordon Levitt), a man who has done nothing in life to provoke cancer, but somehow gets a rare type of it. Levitt puts a lot of charisma into his role, and Rogen is flat out hilarious. Adam soon visits a therapist named Katherine (Anna Kendrick) who is not very experienced in the world of therapy, and the audience questions if she's a good match for him. Now, you may be asking yourself..what's so funny about cancer? The answer is nothing, but the way the characters react to cancer in 50/50 and the way that they learn to cope with it is both laugh out loud funny and touching. 50/50 is incredibly acted as well..everyone puts their all into their roles. 50/50 is not a cringe- inducing mockery of cancer like it could of potentially been, but is instead a comedy that makes my list of the best films of 2011 so far, and it may even be on the top."

","Four months earlier you begin to watch a trailer about a buddy comedy about cancer with Seth Rogen. The trailer makes you laugh your way into watching the movie four months later. But the movie is not what you expected and thankfully the trailers are deceiving to make you believe that Seth Rogen is going to play a commanding role in a movie dealing with cancer. Seth Rogen holds his place firmly in the movie and brings his style of trashy humor but more often or less restrained than his other comedies. What you do surprisingly get is '50/50' the feel good movie of the year starring Seth Rogen.<br/><br/>Adam (Joseph Gordan-Lewitt) is a 27 year old working for a private Radio channel company along with Seth Rogen. Adam has a girlfriend with whom his relationship can be described as platonic at least by Seth Rogen's standards. His girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a paragon of selfishness and clearly has a hold on naïve Adam. When Adam discovers that he has a cancerous tumor growing in his spine, he tells Rachael she could bail herself out of their relationship. But Rachael surprises him and the audience by sticking with him, taking care of him, helping him confide about his disease with his parents and also getting him a new dog Skeletor. <br/><br/>Seth Rogen despises her and hence is more than happy to catch her cheating on Adam with a bearded Hippie. As soon as Adam forces Rachael out of his life, Seth takes over. At each step Seth gives Adam only one advice to get laid and tries to get him laid but more importantly for him getting himself laid using Adam. Adam is shown too kind to embrace the potent of his illness to get him laid frequently.<br/><br/>But Adam responds to two old men who he meets during his Hospital visits to undergo treatment. Those two men become his support system helping each other with sweets filled with weed and smoking medicinal marijuana with Seth Rogen dutifully getting high among with the three cancer buddies. <br/><br/>The audiences are provided a surprisingly poignant and perfect new relationship Adam slowly and naturally gets involved with his therapist. Anna Kendrick who plays the character of Dr. Katherine McKay surely knows how to use her awkward girlish behavior to manipulate the audience. She may not be the best actress around but knows how to work her way up to win the viewer's favor. Dr. McKay is a 24 year old therapist helping Adam deal with the trauma of his life threatening disease. But her inexperience adds another angle and Adam find himself slowly and naturally falling for her caring approach towards him.<br/><br/>The story could not be more straight forward and could be included in the category of Patch Adam. But Seth Rogen runs over the minefield of clichés carefully and we witness a very personal and poetic story told with heartfelt poignancy. '50/50' is told with a floating pace that creates a poetic rhythm to the scenes. <br/><br/>The story succeeds in covering all aspects of the patient's pain and trauma while keeping it light hearted. Adam's relationship with his overbearing but affable Mother and dealing with his father's senile amnesia provides memorable moments during the final reel. It is a disease that is hard to be laughed away but Will Reiser's script keeps situation and moments as real as possible and succeeds in keeping the audience smiling all the way through a very happy ending.<br/><br/>For more reviews visit http://cinemadose.blogspot.com/"

","I just saw 50/50 on a whim having seen one trailer (which I will talk down about in a moment) and liking Seth Rogan in pretty much anything I've seen him in. I wasn't prepared to be fighting the movie as it tried to yank tears out of my eye ducts, mostly because of the trailer.<br/><br/>Now granted, I kind of dismissed the trailer a bit. Again, I saw Seth Rogan doing his usual funny comments on and coming up with plans that backfire but the gist of the trailer made it seem like two desperate friends come up with a scheme to get women. My guess based on the trailer was that sooner or later, the secret would come out that no one was suffering from cancer. Yeah, thanks a lot, trailer. That's TWICE you've completely misrepresented movies in a span of a month (Drive being the other).<br/><br/>So to the actual movie, it centers around a young guy who seems to pride himself on being healthy, doing the right thing (we see him in the opening credits wait for a crosswalk to turn green even while someone else just crosses the street anyway because no cars are coming) due in no small part to an over concerned mother who seems to be overbearing but with good intentions. But even living healthy cannot stop the emergence of a rare cancer in his spine. <br/><br/>While the movie was very heartfelt (again, tear-jerking galore from the middle to the end of the movie), it was also very funny. Seth Rogan provided the goof-ball comic relief while Anna Kendrick and Levitt's interactions as first timers on both sides of the psychologist and patient relationship provide at time hilarious interactions as both deal with reality. Angelica Huston was very convincing as the too-much- concerned-with-everything mother who wants very badly to help but keeps offering it in ways Levitt doesn't want. <br/><br/>Overall, it was very fun in the scenes where Seth and Joseph dueling with the cancer and insincere girlfriends. One of my favorite scenes involves Seth Rogan's reaction to learning of Levitt's girlfriend's secret and how he lets him know. Very funny stuff.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a goof-ball comedy, don't let the trailers fool you. This is more or less on the same lines as movies like Knocked Up, but with much more emphasis on the drama side of things as cancer and death are a lot more serious issues to deal with as a human than being an unexpected parent. In all, a good rounded flick and one to watch and actually take something from when you leave the theater. <br/><br/>8/10"

","I went to see the movie 50/50 without having any prior knowledge as to whether it was supposed to be a comedy or a more serious film; It ended up being a little of both. The movie, inspired by a true story, is about Adam, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, better known for his roles in Inception and on the T.V. show 3rd Rock from the Sun. Kyle finds out he has a rare form of cancer and shows how his relationships with people change because of this heartbreaking news. <br/><br/>Director Jonathan Levine, mostly known for his HBO series How to Make It in America, does a wonderful job using a script drafted by Will Reiser. 50/50, Reiser's first feature film, is loosely based on the screen writer's personal real-life battle with cancer.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt gives a really great performance. He displays a wide variety of emotions and is excellent in portraying all them. As a cancer survivor myself, I was able to connect with the character and truly felt that the emotions were very true to life. Seth Rogen plays Kyle, the best friend and Adam's main support system and care giver. Kyle stands by Adam, as he struggles with his new found disease, every step of the way along the way. Kyle tries to find humor in a very serious illness and he makes you laugh out loud with some of his comments. I really enjoyed the friendship of the two guys while they went through this together. In most films of this nature, we are typically given two women as best friends, which we are to associate with; in 50/50 it was nice to see two men sharing that relationship. Anna Kendrick and Bryce Dallas Howard also star in 50/50. I have to say, I consider myself a big fan of Anna Kendrick; and not just because she is in the Twilight series of films (so is Bryce by the way!). I enjoyed seeing her in a different role than what I've come to expect. Anna played Katharine, a therapist who helped Adam to cope with his cancer. Bryce did well too, she played the not very supportive girlfriend, Rachael It was kind of hard to like her because of the part she played but, she was a very good at being someone you aren't supposed to like very much.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I had expected to, considering the subject matter. The characters were able to inject a lighthearted humor into something most of us don't want to think about; regardless of how many people it affects in the world today. I enjoyed all of the performances, and thought it was great to see a number of actors and actresses that I really like together in this film.<br/><br/>Grade: B<br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"

","Shame on me for expecting a story based on actual events and cancer to be a comedy. After all the film did feature Seth Rogen (Kyle) prominently, he is without a doubt a comedic presence, and he did provide the comic relief for this film. But the film itself was no comedy as was represented by the trailer. I am not a big fan of dramas and no fan at all of cancer, but this film was done very nicely with its handling of the somber subject matter. Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) plays an affable young man who just like most everyone else on the planet is going about living his life, has parents with his mother Diane (Angelica Houston)dealing with age related issues, a best friend from childhood Kyle and a steady girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) when he finds out that he has cancer. I have to say that I agreed inaudibly with every mean spirited derogatory word that Kyle used audibly to describe Rachael. Everything said was exactly how she was portrayed so convincingly and the remarkable thing was that she did not seem to realize what a total bee-otch she was. Who gives a person that is potentially dying and needs to be cared for a dog that seems like it is potentially dying and needs to be cared for? Again this film is based on a true story so I think that Rachael wins the prize for Worst Girlfriend Ever! I digress. It turns out that the type of cancer that Adam has comes with a fifty-fifty chance of him surviving. He actually appears to handle the whole situation fairly well, he begins to follow the prescribed treatment plan and encounters others who are dealing with their own illness. Part of the treatment to aid him in dealing with his diagnosis includes sessions with a therapist. The most interesting dynamic was between Adam and Katherine (Anna Kendrick) as she works on developing a therapist-patient relationship we learn as much about her as a person as we have about Adam. The thing that made this film enjoyable was the fact that it was not just about cancer it was a buddy tale. Would that everyone could have a really good friend like Kyle to be there in one of the toughest times of their life, still when the story began to wind down I found myself asking 'what happens next?', which in part is the reason for the amber light."

","This movie has received raves from every critic that I've heard from so going in I had very high expectations. Thankfully they were met. 50/50 is a superb film that tells the story of a man diagnosed with Cancer at an early age and finds out his odds are 50/50. First thing first, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of my favorite actors and this is such a tremendous performance. One scene towards the end of the movie brought me to tears because he was so good. Seth Rogen plays the same basic role, however he isn't annoying in this movie. He does go a little over the top at times but it isn't anything overly dramatic. The script written by Seth Rogen's best friend Will Reiser is based on his story of going through the process of learning that he had Cancer and how he dealt with it (Reiser not Rogen just to be clear). This is well directed and extraordinarily paced. The thing that impresses me most about this film besides Joseph is the fact that I never once asked myself how much longer the film was while watching. I was so engaged and into the story that I was just watching the movie and not thinking about anything else. That RARELY happens with me. It will be a crime if this film isn't nominated for Best picture, screenplay, actor, and supporting cast members (not all). I can understand if people are hesitant on seeing this movie for fear of it being too depressing given the subject matter but I assure you that it is a joy to watch. It has great comedy in it and while emotional it's just too good to miss. Please do not deny yourself the pleasure of watching this amazing film. It is worth it."

","From the trailer you would think that this film was a comedy about cancer, but you would be seriously wrong. Although there were some very funny lines in the film, this film gets realistic really quick. Being that it is based on a true story, the lead character, Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) very quickly became very endearing. The story emphasizes that although you can follow all the rules, be a nice guy and treat people with respect, you can still get cancer. I really liked Joseph in Inception, but I liked him even more in this film. I think that he captured the essence of the fear that ensues when those dreadful words come roaring out of your doctor's mouth. Once again Bryce Dallas Howard (Rachael) is strapped with the mean-girl role. She was not quite as mean as she was in The Help, but if there is one person that you want to hate in this film, it is her. Hopefully she will not be type-cast and can get out and spread her wings a bit. Seth Rogan (Kyle) turns out to be a true friend. He is the type of friend that I hope that I have should the occasion arise. Seth was responsible for adding some light-heartedness to this otherwise dismal film and he did an exceptional job. The rest of the cast also pulled at your heart-strings with everyone having their own challenges in their lives. Diane (Anjelica Huston), Adam's mom was the typical concerned mom who was also dealing with her husband Richard's (Serge Houde) situation. I am not sure if I could ever be as strong as she had to be in this film. I guess you just have to deal with things as things arise and roll with the punches. Katherine (Anna Kendrick) was a pleasant addition to the cast as the sometime bumbling psychologist. <br/><br/>This film was just as much about relationships as it was about dealing with cancer. The scriptwriter, Will Reiser was brilliant in understanding just the right things to say at exactly the right time. Hopefully this will get him out of the shadows of his cousin, Paul Reiser. There was not one minute that I felt bored or uninterested, but I do not think that this is a ""must-see"" film, even though it did make me laugh out loud and made me shed more than just a few tears. I am giving this film a very, very bright amber light."
