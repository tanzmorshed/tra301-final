","Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!"
"jhclues","10","77","87","21 November 2001"," The Magic Comes To Life!
","Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.<br/><br/>	What a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life.  And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job.  More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special.  The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end.  From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience; and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter.  And it's magic.<br/><br/>	Even having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part.  And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here.  Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it.  A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.<br/><br/>	Also turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione.  As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect.  Grint is `Everyboy,' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing.  And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.<br/><br/>	It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful.  Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell.  Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable:  Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation.  <br/><br/>	The additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch).  From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone.  A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here.  An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages.  A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10."
"BiiivAL","9","78","90","5 June 2018"," ...Welcome to magic world
","The breeze stirred the neatly cut bushes of Tisovaya Street, silently lying under the ink-black sky. Of all the streets in the world, this street was the least suitable for amazing events. Harry Potter turned in his sleep. A small hand groped for it and squeezed the envelope. The boy was asleep ... ""(c)<br/><br/>June 30, 1997 in the light came the debut of the writer Joan Kathleen Rowling. Literally such words began to become great, a series about a small wizard, with a scar on his forehead. The story that absorbed the minds of adolescents around the world, as it was said in the press ""... a book that can tear boys and girls away from TVs and computers, return it to the house from the street ...""<br/><br/>Just imagine...<br/><br/>""A dull, dank, dark night. In the street a storm. The little boy lies on the floor of his ""room"", in a small shack and draws a finger in the sand with an inscription, ""Happy Birthday, Harry!"". The cry of the soul, he knows that no one will congratulate him, no one will affably caress the top of his head. In a minute he will be eleven. Ten seconds ... Nine ... You can wake Dudley - just for laughing ... Three ... Two ... One ... A loud knock at the door, there's no knock, just a crash. There was someone behind the door, and he was obviously going to come in. ""<br/><br/>I think anyone will guess what happened next. Good-natured giant Hagrid, told Harry the striking news that he is not just a boy with a scar on his forehead, but a real magician.<br/><br/>A short word about the actors.<br/><br/>Harry<br/><br/>What to say, there would not be Harry James Potter, there would not be the book itself. Whatever happens in the books, I was always entirely for his character. In the first part, he's just small, you can even tell a confused boy. All situations, difficult fights, intricate situations, are still ahead. Now he just scooped up this great knowledge - magic. The first real home, first friends, first classes, the first meeting with this evil, he is experiencing all this in the first part.
Hermione<br/><br/>Hermione Jane Granger is my favorite female character in the book and film. In it, I see a part of myself. Hermione loves to learn and she pays a lot of time. Sometimes she is too arrogant and excessively proud of her success in her studies. Born of a muggle, so often heard the offensive word ""Mudblood"" in her address. Hermione is just a smart girl, how many times she has yet to pull friends out of difficult situations.<br/><br/>Ron<br/><br/>Ronald Bilius Weasley. Redhead. Already this word can give some characteristic. Ron is the sixth child in a wealthy family of hereditary magicians. Always the elders took on everything superior to Ron, be it study, sport, or female attention. Arriving at Hogwarts, gets to know Harry, the same situation is repeated as with the brothers, but he reconciles with his second plan. Whatever it is, he remains the best friend of Harry and Hermione.<br/><br/>I wanted to say that the whole trio was exactly the same as it was represented by millions of readers in the world. Actors took absolutely unknown, but this film made them real little stars.<br/><br/>The movie has good enough, more famous actors, the same Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters and the inimitable Richard Harris. His death was just a blow to all the fans, his Dumbledore seemed to come off the pages of the book, the same wise look from under the half-glasses, gray hair and beard, hooked nose. He inspired a kind of majestic calmness, every appearance on the screen calming. By the way, I do not consider Michael Gambon a good Dumbledore, he turned out to be some kind of crazy, but this is not on this topic.
It is quite possible to write now a complete retelling of the book / movie, but you know, absolutely do not want to. Joan Rowling created an amazing, magical world, thanks to her, millions of boys and girls began to look for a scar on their foreheads and with impatience and hope to wait for their 11th birthday. And I'm certainly happy about how Chris Columbus embodied this idea on the screen, the fairy tale turned out to be absolutely childish, very bright, joyful and for some reason the word Christmas comes to mind, although there is not so much Christmas there.<br/><br/>Children's dream came true. Harry found his friends, his family, found loyal defenders, but he does not even suspect what he will have in the future. However, it will not be soon, but now enjoy watching!<br/><br/>Dedicated to: all those who are ready to go with Harry to the end."
"nicholas_clarke","Null","62","77","10 November 2001"," As good an adaption as could ever be expected
","To be faced with the challenge of adapting Harry Potter for the Silver screen must have been any director's nightmare- the chance of directing possibly the biggest film of this decade, but also the hardest audience-the millions of fans of the book who know every line and will pick up on every mistake. Being one of the above, I can only say that Christopher Columbus and all of the team working on HP did marvelously. The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect. The only qualm is that it does not track perfectly with the book, but squeezed into 2.5 hours, this can only be expected. Well done all involved!"
"kylopod","7","214","283","20 November 2001"," Wonderful adaptation, but missing the satire of the book
","I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.<br/><br/>Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Mary Poppins,"" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.<br/><br/>As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, ""Adventures in Babysitting""), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.<br/><br/>I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.<br/><br/>But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--""Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers""--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.<br/><br/>Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.<br/><br/>The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary ""muggle"" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.<br/><br/>Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.<br/><br/>The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.<br/><br/>What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing."
"HotToastyRag","10","9","9","17 June 2019"," There's nothing like the first
","There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.<br/><br/>I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the ""magical"" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!<br/><br/>Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as ""guest stars"" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word ""earwax"" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as ""Maggie Smith cats"", mumble ""Shouldn't have said that,"" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?<br/><br/>First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.<br/><br/>Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name ""Fluffy,"" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie."

","We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.<br/><br/>Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.<br/><br/>It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.<br/><br/>The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.<br/><br/>The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.<br/><br/>Other than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.<br/><br/>Dan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.<br/><br/>Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.<br/><br/>The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.<br/><br/>Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.<br/><br/>David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.<br/><br/>The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.<br/><br/>The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)<br/><br/>The set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.<br/><br/>The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.<br/><br/>The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.<br/><br/>So it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.<br/><br/>8/10 at the very least. A really satisfactory film!"

","To millions of children of all ages, November 16 has been more eagerly anticipated than Christmas, as the long-awaited film version of J. K. Rowling's beloved novel ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" hits the screen.<br/><br/>Each of Rowling's four Harry Potter books have been critically acclaimed worldwide best-sellers, turning a generation of video-game playing children into avid readers.<br/><br/>In translating Rowling's world of wizards and magic to the screen, the film makers claimed to be intensely aware of the fans' high expectations and had sworn to be faithful to the book.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" is indeed the most loyal film adaptation of a book that this fan has ever seen.<br/><br/>It's the story of an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that his parents were wizards and that he is in fact a famous and powerful wizard himself.<br/><br/>Released from the clutches of his desperately ordinary (and non-magical) Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia - and their deliciously obnoxious son Dudley - Harry takes his place in the wizarding world as a first year student at the venerated Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br/><br/>A great deal of ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" is an introduction to this fantastic and dangerous world and its richly drawn characters. There's not only a lot of plot to cover in this film, but an entire world to create.<br/><br/>At two and a half hours long (hit the restroom before it starts), the film includes the book's most memorable scenes, bringing many of them to life with pure cinematic wizardry.<br/><br/>The Quidditch match (a soccer/hockey/rugby thing played on broomsticks) is much more exciting on the screen than on the page, as is the bathroom battle with an enormous mountain troll and the larger-than-life game of wizard's chess.<br/><br/>The frightening aspects of the book are in full force in the film, and its PG rating (for some scary moments) should be taken seriously.<br/><br/>
Screenwriter Steven Kloves (""Wonder Boys"") has done a fine job of streamlining Rowling's tale while maintaining its spirit. Director Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"") makes good on his promise to be faithful to the book. But at times the film is a bit too reverent; you want the actors to cut loose and have a bit more fun.<br/><br/>Columbus clearly understands that fantasy works best when it's played most real. Across the board, his fine ensemble of actors are so perfectly cast that they appear to have literally stepped out of Rowling's book.<br/><br/>
In the title role, Daniel Radcliffe pulls off the very difficult task of playing an introverted hero who spends most of the movie reacting to the amazing sights and events around him. He beautifully captures the deep soul and untapped potential of Harry Potter. And when this kid smiles the screen lights up.<br/><br/>Rupert Grint is delightful as Harry's sardonic buddy Ron Weasley and Emma Watson nearly steals the film as their overachieving friend Hermione Granger. Three cheers to the film makers for giving three unknown child actors the top billing they deserve.<br/><br/>The strong cast of veteran actors includes Richard Harris as the wise Headmaster Dumbledore and Robbie Coltrane as the lovable giant Hagrid. Alan Rickman is wonderfully villainous as Professor Snape and Zoe Wanamaker has just the right touch of girls gym teacher as flying instructor Madame Hooch.<br/><br/>
As the strict but just Professor McGonagall, Oscar winner Maggie Smith seems born to play the role - and is ready for another Oscar.<br/><br/>John Cleese (as Nearly Headless Nick) and Julie Walters (as Mrs. Weasley) have all-too-brief cameo roles, but if the next film ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" remains true to the book, we'll be seeing more of them.<br/><br/>In addition to being highly engaging, the film is a marvelous thing to look at. From the bustling wizard street Diagon Alley to the magnificently gothic Hogwarts School to the dark and misty Forbidden Forest, the film breaks new ground in imaginative production design.<br/><br/>To paraphrase the film's tagline, let the magic (and box office records) begin."

","I watched this movie first time when I was left with no choice. My expectations were extremely low as I always wondered if Harry Potter books were over-hyped. How-ever after watching the movie it did make me a Harry Potter movie fan. And needless to say - this continues to remain my favourite of HP series. That brings to a point here.... the effect of expectations over a movie. True, expectations reduce joy.<br/><br/>Without going into the story I would certainly say Chris Columbus churns out a perfect pot-pourri of emotions, suspense and magic, delivering something appealing to all ages.<br/><br/>Every character brought to life on screen has done justice and leave an impression on you. Particularly notable performances by Emma Watson and Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>CGI are in plenty and made good of. The Quedditch game is picturised amazingly. The wizard's chess is treat to eyes.<br/><br/>Let's hope that the forthcoming HP series carries the similar magical touch."

","When I knew the film was being made, I thought how could they make a film that would be up to the standard of such a perfect book. But they did! Sure they missed bits out but they captured the essence of the book brilliantly. One member of the cast was mis-cast for me but my children disagreed.I even found myself believing they were flying and not wondering ""how are they doing that?"" So 10 out 10 Warner Brothers.

"davidneuhoff","8","6","6","26 December 2017"," The best that it could have possibly gotten
","There is a major difference between reviews here and this is very easy to explain. Anybody who (like me) has read the books multiple times, knowing the slightest details and loving absolutely everything from the series, can´t be completely happy with the film. For the neutral watcher who read the books maybe once or not even at all this movie must seem like a really entertaining and well directed film. The problem is that though very good acting, especially Alan Rickman as Snape, a beautiful scenery and very good camera work, the most important essentials of the books are pretty much non-existing. For instance, I, as an hardcore fan since the first time reading the books when i was 9, was always extremely interested in reading a passage of a normal school lesson or a normal day at any job of an fully educated wizard, eg in the ministry of magic. Rowling made us have the desire to always experience more of the universe she created. I was always amazed by the lightness and uncomplicated way of Rowlings writing, how she managed to let us accompany Harry in his daily life, making the actually extremely strange and funny way of the magicians life seem so normal and casual for the readers. The film on the other hand is more of a build-up to Harry´s first encounter with Voldemort, a scene that´s perfectly directed with impressive effects and good filming, which is definitely the highlight of as well film and book, with the difference that the book is more focused in describing Harry´s adventrous first year as a whole. The film is a little bit inconsistent in terms of how close it sticks to the book´s plot and this is another problem. Because of the book being so comprehensive and full it is nearly impossible not to skip any sections of the book. In my opinion the screenwriter should have either sticked closer to the book or distanced the filmplot more from it. Another thing i miss is the great dry humour the book is spiced with in a lot of ways. The problem is that this can´t really be translated in the movie because it´s often in the way Rowling describes things and not only in the dialogues. One thing that is awesome is the music. In my opinion John Williams is the best film music composer and the way he captures the mysterious and thrilling atmosphere and the majesty and greatness of Hogwarts is marvelous. At the end I can say that the film can meet the expectations but it´s just not possible to convince a haerdore fan completely, just because while reading the book, everybody creates his own picture of Hogwarts, the characters and the scenery. This is called imagination, it is the best part of reading a book, not possible to be translated completetly satisfyingly into a movie and the reason to my big recommandation concerning Harry Potter and also every other book which is filmed. Read the book first! If you watch the film first and read the books afterwards you´ll miss a great time imagining everything for yourself. And this will come espescially pronounced in the books of Harry Potter."

","I feel, next to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book-to-movie adaptation that I've ever seen. The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking.  The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.   The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story.  Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience.<br/><br/>Many kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter cast/crew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become:  a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles, kid's meals and fast food tie-ins, soft drinks and snack products, etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves.  There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that, Yes.  I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed.  He has proven, at least to me, that Diagon Alley truly exists - if only I could find the right brick to tap on.  The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me, but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit, one day.<br/><br/>One of my favorite moments, is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence.  By Adrenaline Sequence, I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes, doesn't necessarily propel the story, but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff, ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace.  The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence.  I was very happy to finally see the 'hockey/soccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life.  The Quidditch Sequence is, by far, my favorite sequence in the whole film.  The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another.  My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages.  Fans and non-fans alike will enjoy this colorful story of good versus evil and the friendships that endure."

","When I first saw this movie I was ten years old, the same age the characters where supposed to be. My older cousin and her boyfriend took me to the Mall to watch a movie. Back then I wasn't going very often to the cinema, due to the fact that my parents didn't have time and I wasn't old enough to go alone to any theater. The movie captivated my attention like nothing before and I became so interested in anything that had to do with this movie, and I heard that it was made after a book. I didn't had Internet back then, but I found the first book at a library and convinced my mother to buy it. That's how I became obsessed with reading and writing.<br/><br/>I may say, ""Harry Potter"" affected me in a positive way, because after I finished reading all the published books back then, I wanted to read more books and I must thank J.K.Rowling for her genius, if it wasn't for her books, I might have been right now an average seventeen year old, at some party, drinking my brains out. This movie got me to the right path in life.<br/><br/>I know, you probably don't care about my story, you readers only want to hear about what I thought of the movie, but I believe my story can influence you if you are a parent and thinking whether or not you should let your children watch this film. My advice is yes and I have presented my reason above.<br/><br/>The story is simply magical and ""Hogwarts"" is a genius invention. The movie is done well, almost perfect. It's the closest to the book they can get and it's an amazing experience for any kid."

","Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out."

","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a film directed by Chris Columbus. For many years, I hadn't given a damn about the Harry Potter series. But seeing the fanfare surrounded by the series, I decided to give it a try. After watching this one, I can definitely say that I am on the verge of being a fan.<br/><br/>Plot: Harry Potter, an orphan living with his uncle and his family is invited to Hogwarts School of Magic to become a wizard.<br/><br/>Story and direction: I had watched this part around the time it released but never just kept in touch since I didn't understand a word. Seeing it now as an adult and a movie lover, I just fell in love with this fictional world created. The characters, settings, story, etc.. all just feel seamless. Thanks to J K Rowling, Steve Kloves and Chris Columbus who have done justice to the source material provided to them. I feel the themes are so very relevant in this film. The intricacies of those themes are valid in the current world we do live in. This is what I just exactly want from any story presented to me. Although the film is very long, I never felt bored for a single moment. And to adapt quite a huge novel comes with responsibility and precaution, which the makers completely justified. The sets are huge and awesome. You just feel you are in Hogwarts actually. Also each characters costume is just to marvel at. John Williams once again just proves why he is the composer of the century. But I did feel some flaws to the film. Being a first film, the main plot of the film comes at around the 90th minute of the film. Also the VFX of the film felt very amateur considering some great VFX was done in the years preceding this film.<br/><br/>Performances: I would say that the casting of the film is just perfect. Applause for the casting team is deserved. Never do you feel that another actor should play the role. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. These 10-11 year old just steal your heart. Also the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane make themselves likable.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: There were many favourite scenes in this film for me. But one scene in particular was the troll scene where Harry and Ron decide to save Hermione and after the saving Hermione vouches for the boys. This is the scene where you actually happen to see the bond solidified between the 3 as friends.<br/><br/>Verdict: For anyone who just loves fantasy film and worlds with great visuals, this film is just for you. I assure you won't be disappointed. I plan on seeing the entire series now because I am fascinated by this world and want to see what else has it got to offer.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8/10."
"Movie-12","7","50","86","18 December 2001"," It's a true adaptation, but lacks an edge like the novel. *** (out of four)
","HARRY POTTER / (2001) *** (out of four)<br/><br/>Here's a method of evaluating a movie based on previously published material: ask yourself if the film makes you want to read the material from which it is based?  <br/><br/>Before the release of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling's fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment, I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member, I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book's intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me.  <br/><br/>With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages, J.K. Rowling's best-selling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, with soaring expectations abound, the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel, with very few differences. <br/><br/>That said, the film does run into a few conflicts with the book's story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It's like a false second act; almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We're left with a grand display of eye-popping special effects.<br/><br/>
""Harry Potter"" certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Soon after the film opens, the boy discovers he has magical powers. He's then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. He's sent to a school for young wizard children, where he meets new friends, learns about magic, and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn't like Harry, as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry?<br/><br/>
The film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn't give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don't really care about the mystery because we don't know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist, but it doesn't encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity, it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this; the movie does not. <br/><br/>After his gentle ""Home Alone"" and sweet-natured ""Stepmom,"" many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the story-and for good reason. ""Harry Potter"" contains charming, likable characters and a rich pallet of lush, inventive images. Unfortunately, the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences, but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Despite it's childish story and pre-teen characters, many define ""Harry Potter"" as a film for all ages. While that's debatable, during my screening, adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen. <br/><br/>Conclusion: It's a sure-fire experience for children, especially if they've read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again, if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater, why am I recommending the film?"

","Harry Potter movies are one of my favorite ones, and I can watch them several times. I watch it every time it's on TV, and there is one channel that shows all the series of this incredible movie every time after the new year. I also want to mention that even my family members like to watch it with me. My grandmother especially likes it. This fact indicates that this movie is interesting not only for children but also for elderly people and it's not weird for me. There are so many things going on in this movie, so many secrets and beautiful scenes. Plus a big thanks for the graphics of the movie, everything is very realistic. For example, the mermaids or the dinosaurs. Moreover, there is a massive animatronic creature in this movie- spider and after watching the movie google about it and found out that Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron Weasley, one of the main characters, is afraid of spiders just s much as his character is, and said it was easily the scariest scenes to film. I'm scared of spiders too, and I know how it feels when you see them. Thus, I really appreciate the job that this actor did. In my opinion, despite the fact that he had to play again a guy, who was scaring from spiders, it is again hard to play the role by looking at the creature that gives you goosebumps. Thus, this movie not only good in graphics, but also the cast."

","In many ways the best of the franchise so far. I was free from any anticipation for this film being not overly impressed by the fantasy genre. This film redeems itself above other sorcery films with its old fashioned English ambiance being greater than arch and portentous fantasy.<br/><br/>Unlike other fantasy films the directors face the challenge of a highly critical audience of children who are more familiar with the books that they are & waiting expectantly for their favorite part of the book and would tear the director to ices if he was there in their anger such omissions. Any changes in the film would be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. In the production of the first film this was a contention in preproduction. As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done as far as special effects go. The actors although experienced are let down by the younger cast not being trained and coming from a stage school background with the exception of the lead show the typical stiltedness of such training. Daniel Radcliffe has been accused of being too subdued in the title role but as he becomes older he character does become more sombre. Alos it allows the other characters oddities to shine more clearly in contrast to his quieter style."

"ironhorse_iv","7","3","4","16 July 2014"," This movie set in stone, what would be the foundation of the Harry Potter film franchise. It kinda work.
","It's seem like just yesterday, when the movie about the boy whom lived, was about to come out. People were wondering if the Harry Potter's books by J.K Rowling could easily be translated into the big screen. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone AKA Sorcerer's Stone directed by Chris Columbus, indeed show that it was somewhat possible. The story follows Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)'s first year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry as he discovers his gift and destiny against the dark forces of magic. The movie like the other films are cut into two plots directions. One is about student life at Hogwarts during the school-year, while the other half is about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. It works well as a long read novel, but in movie form: its means a long sit through. The movie pacing is so long. It takes forever to get to the main plot of Harry Potter finding the Philosopher Stone. There are is a lot of filler scenes that could be cut away. I dislike how the Philosopher Stone is one-time movie McGuffin. For the best of my knowledge, the Philosopher stone plays no factor after this movie, and never mention again after this film. The third act, mostly comes out of nowhere. The twist toward the end, was pretty predictable, if you readt the books, but pretty interesting. Another thing about the movie is how non-logical the movie is. It really baffled me, how much exposition, it needed. Even an hour in the film, there were a lot of random odd things happening without much explaining. It gets more confusing as long bits of the book, like the Centaur showing in the woods, were shorten in the film. It gets worst for the centaur, as he wouldn't play a factor, in any of the later films, despite, saving Harry Potter from Voldermort. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) was also cut short. Her riddle solving in the book was cut from the film. Several minor characters have been removed from the film version, as well. Despite those, the movie is really close to the novel. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. Still, there were some really dumb things to nitpick here like why would Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris), even allow Harry Potter to stay with the Dursley's family when he knows that they're horrible people. Honestly, the Dursleys could had killed Harry Potter with the childhood neglect! What was he thinking? Harry Potter could had commit suicide, or gone crazy like Lord Voldermort! What an idiot! The whole movie is about children being danger all the time. I don't care if they're wizards in training, I'm surprise that the death tolls of students dying isn't as high as it should be. The school staff is questionable at times. A good example of this stupidity, is punishing students whom went out at nights, by sending them out at nights in the dark forest, where they can get attacked by creatures. The most insulting thing in logic is the black/white one-dimensional view of good Vs evil. Honestly, how on earth is the members of Slytherin never got expulsion for all the bullies that it has? You would think, that at less, there would be one good person in Slytherin. Another thing that bugs me is the whole the power of love conquer all. I think, children are a lot smarter than the childish message, the film is trying to pull. The acting in the movie is pretty bland, for the most part. After all, most of the child actors had this film as their first roles. I wouldn't say that Harry Potter's film series, have the most entertaining of dialogues, anyways. The wooden delivery, felt like a read-through. Most of what they're saying are stating the obvious or repeating what happening on screen. It's so annoying. The other actors were master British thespians, who seem to over-act at times. A good example of this is John Hurt & Alan Rickman. It was too hammy for already over the top world. The action scenes were pretty well-done. My favorite had to be the Quidditch match and the whole chess game. I can do, without the whole troll scene. The CGI troll hasn't aged well. Visually, the movie is beautiful to look at. I love the special effects, locations & set, and costume, they did. It really made the Harry Potter world, stand out. The music by John Williams is amazing to listen to. I think director Chris Columbus was indeed the best choice for this first movie, as he got the magically part, right and how to make a family picture. You even see, how much things, he establish that other directors would reused time after time. Still, I really hope for Terry Gilliam like J.K Rowling's first choice to be the direction. The movie has great social commentary themes like the metaphor of racism, ethnic cleansing and why Nazism is bad. You can also see possible influences from other words, that made Harry Potter work. There was a few controversial moments leading up to the film, like religious debates. A few religious groups claim that Harry Potter contain occult or Satanic subtexts that isn't good for children. Another one is the use of the word, sorcerer over the word philosopher in the title. US & British have different meanings to the words, plus marketing though, it would better to call it sorcerer as that word get more appeal. Due to this different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name had to be reshot, once with the actors saying ""philosopher's"" and once with ""sorcerer's"". Overall: The movie might has its flaws, but majority, a great first watch for any fantasy fan."

","Well, for starters, the older cast, almost all of whom are instantly recognizable if you've seen much of British television or film, are simply delightful in their roles, with special honors going to Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, and Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid. Some other positive aspects to the film is that it is a faithful adaptation for the most part, and the child actors certainly aren't the worst I've ever seen. Moreover, John Williams' brilliant score was at the time one of the best in years.<br/><br/>With all this talent at his disposal, Chris Columbus seems almost determined to make the movie as childish and as non-magical as possible. One of the main reasons the Harry Potter books were so successful in the first place was because they really weren't just books for kids, they were books for kids that adults could enjoy. J.K. Rowling created a beautiful, magical world and a bunch of very interesting characters that could keep you interested in reading a book for days, if not weeks. Chris Columbus, however, dumbs it all down to the level that it's not even interesting for two and a half hours. On a superficial level, Columbus might have seemed a good choice to direct; he had been commercially successful in the past, had made some funny comedies (""Home Alone"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"") and even handle a drama reasonably well (""Bicentennial Man""). However, Columbus has also failed at both those styles before; ""Stepmom"" was manipulative, overly sentimental dreck and ""Nine Months"" simply wasn't funny.<br/><br/>Columbus decides to direct this as a kids' movie, and effectively ruins the film in the process. Steve Kloves' script doesn't help either, as it simply plays into Columbus' childish perception with some unbearable slapstick 'humor', which completely destroys most of the novel's charm.<br/><br/>There are a couple of solid sequences in this mess of a film, particularly the final scenes, but considering the solid source material and the talent involved, the film is ultimately a failure. It is technically competent and the visual effects are definitely good but unfortunately, in concentrating on the technical aspects, Columbus has wasted a lot of talent and forsaken most of what makes a movie good (acting and writing) for the sake of making the movie merely look good. This may work the first time but the film is a bore on repeated viewings and just doesn't hold up well at all.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Dropped with his aunt and uncle as a baby, Harry grows up in a loveless home and is made to sleep under the stairs.  On his 11th birthday Harry learns the truth of his past when he is visited by Rubeus Hagrid and invited to attend Hogwart's school for wizards and witches.  Whilst learning his craft Harry and his friends notice some strange things and begin to investigate, leading them deeper into a mystery that involves a dark wizard who killed Harry's parents and a quest for a powerful stone that brings immortality.<br/><br/>I had no strong desires to see this film.  I have not read any of the books, nor do I have any plans to as they just don't interest me.  Back in my family home one week I noticed they had bought a copy of this film on VHS and I decided to give it a watch.  I knew little of the plot but it carried me along well enough.  It did seem a little long and that the film was trying to cram as many effects scenes as possible where it should really have been developing characters instead.  Don't get me wrong the effects are all good and hold the interest well, but without the characters I felt like I didn't care very much about the plot.<br/><br/>I know this is a children's film so characters aren't that important but that leads me to another point  the running time.  At over two hours I struggled to care enough to sustain my interest.  I don't have kids but I did wonder how many would be able to focus for that long  but I suppose that the reason for throwing in an effects scene every five minutes just to wake them up!<br/><br/>The cast is crammed with talent  most of which it fails to make good use of.  In the lead Radcliffe is quite bland and didn't do too much with his role.  Happily Grint and Watson who both are funny and have good characters  even if they are only sidekicks in the film, supported him.  It is telling that recent publicity for the second film has put these two on a par with Harry  even giving them their own posters.  Of the support cast only Coltrane is well used, everyone else just has cameos of one sort or another. Hart, Cleese, Harris, Rickman, Smith etc all have only a few scenes at most and (in the case of Rickman and Cleese) a few lines at most.  This is annoying on two levels.  Firstly, the fact that such talent is wasted and secondly the fact that none of them are allowed characters  only a chance to show their face briefly once or twice.<br/><br/>Overall it was enjoyable and will please kids even if only for the regular effects scenes.  It has flaws and it is clearly aimed at those who have Potter fever already.  N the strength of this I will not be going to see the second film until someone gives it to me to watch.  It's a good film but it feels like it is made to see Happy Meals and start a franchise than to be a good film in it's own right. (as a side note  I find it hilarious that it had to be renamed for the USA as the studio felt that the word `philosopher' would confuse American audiences who didn't know what it meant!)"

Daniel Radcliff's acting is terrible, in my honest opinion he was only hired because he looks like the illustrations of Harry Potter and he is definatly what I had pictured in my mind but his acting makes a mockery out of the film and turns it into a spoof of the book, instead of bringing it to life.

The sooner these ""Child Stars"" descend into a drug and sodomy filled adolescence the better for all concerned.<br/><br/>Yes I have read the books, and yes, I enjoyed them, but this is still one of the dullest films I've ever encountered. Sticking to the original story is one thing, but when the audience are left praying for the last 5 chapters to be cut, something's gone wrong.<br/><br/>Back to my original point - where did the £85 million go? The Quidditch match was about on a par with King Kong for realism, and using Fungus the Bogeyman for the Troll was a masterpiece of imagination-free modelling. Perhaps all the money went on getting the magic tricks to look right? Or maybe not. How much effort does it take to have some brat wave his wand, the camera cuts away, comedy explosion sound effect, then camera cuts back to child with spiky hair and blackened face? Pure genius! They really have pushed back the boundaries of comedy here.<br/><br/>All in all I feel cheated out of 2.5 hours of my life, and I strongly recommend that you don't fall into the same trap.

I cannot comment on the translation from book to film or the quality of Rowling's books but the film of the very first novel is quite horrible.  I tried to like it, but I found it excruciating to watch.  It took me no where and, even worse, it really didn't have much of a plot.  The thin shreds of plot were introduced 1 hour and 45 minutes into the film.  The first part of the film was obviously conceived to give a background to the viewer of the Potter world.  Unfortunately there was little to grip me here and I found most of it to be grossly out of place.  What the heck does a game of ""Quidditch"" have to do with the story?  It, and many other things, were just eye candy.  The characters were stale and seemed like rejects from a Roald Dahl story (see James and the Giant Peach).  I'm flabbergasted that such a piece of junk has attracted so many adamant fans.  No wonder kids don't know how to read or write very well anymore.  No wonder Britney Spears and N'Sync are so possible.

Magic comes easily to little Harry Potter, who has no personality to speak of except that he is occasionally sad that he never met his mum and dad.  Years of abuse and neglect have left not a mark on him, so when he gets invited to Hogwarts Academy of Magic, he has nowhere for his character to go.  There he flies around on his broomstick and gets to be a big hero quite by accident without ever confronting any serious obstacles or anything resembling a plot.

","At first I liked the Harry Potter series, it was imaginative, it was original, it was funny, and it had promise. Then the second one came out, ""oh WOW this is heaven, it can't get better than this"", then the third came out, ""I was wrong about the second, because this is awesome"". Then in between finishing the third and the release of the fourth I read the Lord of the Rings. And shortly after, the movies for both came out. I realized the huge difference, I was psyched out when I heard they were making a Harry Potter movie, but there they go and ruin it. Did you know Spielberg was originally supposed to direct, until Miss Rowling insisted it HAD to be an all British cast, in walks in Chris Columbus, a guy who directed Robin Williams in becoming a woman in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", and a guy who's obviously willing to give in to any demand thrown at him by the author as long as he makes money. Well Mr. Columbus seemed to direct Ron into acting like a woman as well. You throw in a B list of child actors and a list of acclaimed adult actors who are far past their prime and who only opted to make these films because their grandchildren begged them to, and you have the first Harry Potter movie. There has never been a more horrific performance than that of Rupert Grint, who now dominates the worst performances of all time, kicking Jake Lloyd from The Phantom Menace out of the way. Daniel Radcliffe doesn't really possess much talent either, I highly doubt he has any future after this film, as far as acting goes anyways. As for Emma Watson, who thinks she's the best in the world, and if you think I'm talking about her performance as Hermione, you're dead wrong, have you listened to her in interviews? The room can barely fit the three of them; her, the interviewer, and her ego. Her performance is also astonishingly bad. I forgot to mention the horrible special effects, I have seen better on TV watching ""Power Rangers"". I mentioned the Lord of the Rings earlier to make reference to the obvious ripoffs of Miss Rowling. Firstly there are the dementors, cloaked ghostlike figures whose faces you never see (cough, RINGWRAITHS!). The whomping willow seems to ring a bell (ENTZ). The Giant Spider named Aragog (SHELOB). The trolls also seem to resemble something I've seen before... OH YEAH, the trolls in Lord of the Rings! Hopefully Warner Bros. choice of hiring different directors for the rest of the films will pay off. But this is the perfect example of a book that could have made an Oscar worthy classical movie, but fell short because instead of making it what it was intended to be they chose to skimp on the effects to make more money on little kids who think it's great because they're too young to watch real special effects in Star Wars or LotR. It really makes me sad, because in the months prior to the first movie I was marveling at the promise of it all. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, they got John Williams to do the score, and like that, it was ruined. Although it does seem that my opinion differs from the rest of the world as Miss Rowling is just raking it in and so are the filmmakers, making even more money by skimping on the special effects that will no doubt succeed in dazzling children who aren't yet potty trained. Here's one buck the woman won't get her hands on."

Maybe because it is the one who has less adventure or danger of all, but I cannot say exactly why. I think it will be very difficult for me, being crazy for Harry Potter's books, to give 10 in any of the H.P.'s movies, since the book is SO MUCH better than any of the films.

Okay, okay. I'll stop with the superlative negatives. Surely there have been worse, and, yes, off the top of my head, I can think of many that are worse. However, for a book that over 125 million people have read, and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history, and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises, and also for a movie which one particularly fat-headed critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation, I am more than severely disappointed. I know that, had it not been so overhyped, it would have been just as bad. Now, however, my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come.<br/><br/>I go into an in depth criticism, but it would be impossible for me to keep to 1000 words. There is hardly a piece of it that I liked. As a film, it was poorly edited, poorly acted (by most), poorly filmed. The only really memorable scene is the troll in the bathroom, although the payoff to it makes no sense whatsoever. The Quidditch game, which has been hyped to all heaven, is completely boring and poorly created. It looks like the FX guys created it with photoshop. When the chess game looked like it was about to be the most exciting sequence in the film, Christopher Columbus, who, I must say, lives up to his reputation completely, begins to edit furiously. I heard afterwards that this was done to avoid a PG-13. My immediate thought is that the filmmakers didn't trust their young audience to enjoy watching a chess game, no matter how exciting it might have been. I'm still not sure which story to buy.<br/><br/>But the person I really want to tear into is J.K. Rowling. What a hack. Never has the word ""hack"" been more fitting. A former waitress, her idea of imagination is to call things by weird names. Only in the mind of a psychopath (or idiot) could the name Draco Malfoy or a Cerberus clone named Fluffy be considered clever. Writing children's literature is not difficult, but this is simply awful. She's clearly ripping off Raoul Dahl like there's no tomorrow, especially in the exposition. The game of Quidditch, which seems to be a drawing point of some sort, is absolutely nonsensical. As a preteen, I invented much more interesting games with much less interesting playing pieces. Quidditch is a game where people score ten points at a time, unless someone catches a special type of ball, which ends the game immediately. So theoretically, the game could end in thirty seconds. And all the other forms of scoring matter not at all. And let's talk about the surprise climax. Really, anyone could have been standing in front of that mirror at the end. It is tremendously unclever. And the penultimate sequence, where the crown is awarded to the best dorm, is anticlimactic and just rude to the children of Slytherin, We only hate one of them, so why should we be happy that the award at first goes to them, and then is cruelly snatched away. And what about Hogwart, anyways? If you're not supposed to use magic when you're away from Hogwart, why the heck would you want to be a wizard anyways?<br/><br/>Friends, you're well on the path to making your children drooling morons. If they want a great series of books about sorcery and magic creatures, make them read the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. This is the most soulless garbage imaginable.

The main problem is that the characters are not likable. Not that they are dislikeable, they are just flat and bland like altar bread. And they don't change at all from the beginning to the end. Who's to blame - the bad actors, the mediocre director, or the awful writer? Really, I've seen far better character development in ""Revenge of the Nerds"".<br/><br/>And the story is just dumb. It starts with a good point: a kid with magical powers. Where did I hear that before? Oh, of course: ""The Books of Magic"". Except for the fact that JK Rowling is no Neil Gaiman... but anyway, here's an example. When Potter's magic powers first appear, he never seems to be too puzzled by them, never gets scared, nor thinks about using them to exact revenge from his cruel family. Hello? Anyone there ever read ""X-Men""? If you suddenly get super-human powers, you must be puzzled and tempted!<br/><br/>Talking about cruel families... they can be excellent plot devices. Green Goblin, anyone? But Potter seems to be immune to a decade of humiliation. Sure, he is quite lethargic (or is it bad acting?), but is never aggressive or rancorous. Which makes no sense.<br/><br/>There are lots of other bad scenes, like the ridiculous chess scene. Remember that scene of ""Attack of the Clones"" that was sometimes mockingly described as 'Star Wars meets Megaman'? This is similar, but even worse. There's no sensible reason for this place to exist, yet it does. Even if the rest of the movie was not a disgrace, that scene alone would have ruined it. Any suspension of disbelief that had survived the previous awfulness of the movie was killed at that exact moment.<br/><br/>Bad acting, bad directing, bad visual effects, bad music, and - above anything else- the bad writing... with all these problems, this movie ends up bland like drinking warm water.

That is:  the story of a young boy who has suddenly had his wildest dream come true, and who now must deal with his newfound celebrity, his amazing magical heritage, and most of all, day to day life at Hogwarts with his friends (and enemies).  The movie is more preoccupied with populating Hogwarts with ghosts and moving staircases than it is with characters of any depth.  Everyone from the book, Harry included, suffers from a serious lack of on-screen development, and as a consequence the story lurches  ponderously from event to event without the throughline that stong character development would bring.  I, for one, am not easily impressed by effects, no matter how impressive, especially when they are a duplicitous substitute for the real strength of a story such as this:  character."

","About halfway through Harry Potter 1, I considered walking out.  It's not that it was godawful, but having read the book, I knew how it all worked out-- and I had no confidence left that there would be anything the least bit interesting about how Rowling's story would be illustrated.<br/><br/>That's what it is; the book faithfully, and dully, illustrated, line by line.  It's so faithful to the order of incidents (and the need to keep the story moving) that it has no time to give us any of the characterization that made us root for Harry; at best we get instantly recognizable movie stereotypes (Draco Malfoy has a Richie Rich 'do, therefore he must be from the same snotty rich kids' fraternity as Greg Marmalard).  Seemingly ideal casting-- Alan Rickman as Snape, say-- is wasted when the characters turn out only to have half a dozen lines in the entire movie, most of them expository.  Maggie Smith, Ian Hart, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, all wasted; the peerless John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick has, as memory serves, all of two lines-- one to explain why he's nearly headless, and one to announce, in Boys' Own Weekly cliches, that the Quidditch Cup is sure going to be hotly contested this year.  Maybe only Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt get enough dialogue to begin to sketch a character.<br/><br/>
The other problem-- not unrelated, surely-- is that Chris Columbus is, for the millionth time, the wrong wrong wrong director for the job.  He has no sense of magic, of mystery, of English eccentricity.  Give him two wizards skulking about a suburban tract house, and he'll make them seem as ordinary as two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him an evil spirit sucking the blood of a dead unicorn and being interrupted by a centaur, and he makes it seem like two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him a chess game, and he makes it seem like World War III.  Give him Gringott's bank, and he ignores the baroque set that's been built and can't wait to show us a big pile of gold, which is surely a bit revealing.  This isn't as awful a blockbuster as, say, Tomb Raider, but it comes from the same land of impoverished imagination camouflaged with booming, expensive yet somehow cheap-looking special effects."

Now I know I'm probably enraging every single person who has read the novel, however this movie is not the novel.  Book and Film are two totally different mediums.  Something that works in a novel, wont decessarily work on the big screen.  Harry Potter is the greatest example of that.<br/><br/>Colombus decided to change very, very little in his adaptation of the novel, which is the movie's greatest fault.  An author has the luxury to spend pages and pages describing a certain image in a story; a film does not have that kind of luxury.  The movie was terribly boring due to the fact that Colombus tried to pace the movie the same way as the book.  That is an impossible feat.  The movie is not meant to be some companion to the novel. If that was the truth, then the 7 billion people who havent read the novel wouldnt even bother showing up to watch.  A movie is supposed to have a broad audience in order to make money, if Colombus feels that he is only making the movie to please Potter fans, then AOL Time Warner will have a huge failure on their hands.  I've never read the book, and some may say that that is the reason why I didnt enjoy the movie.  But again, I went to see a movie, not read a book.  The Godfather is not a classic because it stayed true to Puzo's novel.  It is a classic because Coppola knew what elements would need to be changed in order to make the book filmable. Colombus doesnt have a clue.<br/><br/>The only thing good about Harry Potter was the cinematography.  Most of the film looked brilliant, especially Hogwarts itself.  Yet, a visually pleasing film does not make the film suddenly good.  It doesnt even come close.  The effects are just a testament to the fact that Colombus got his priorities way wrong when he filmed this boring, plodding paced movie.  I voted it a one, I was feeling generous."

Now, we have the results, a film product that is as moribund as Microsoft software. In both the new MS and HP products, we have more than an order of magnitude more spent on promotion than on real innovation or imagination.<br/><br/>This is a completely pedestrian effort. The books are fun, but only about as much as scores of prior ones. The rest is hype.<br/><br/>About the film, I found no charm and three things that impressed me with their lack of skill.<br/><br/>--The most puzzling of these is the score. Though always derivative, Williams has created scores that have become the floor of imagination for vast areas of our minds. He is tepid here, and one can only think is by direction from the Committee.<br/><br/>--No puzzle with the camerawork. The blocking and angles have less art and adventure than any major film this year. Compare the perspectives with `Monsters,' which aren't noticeably arty, but which really adds thrills to the experience.<br/><br/>--The thing that impressed was the ordinariness of the architecture. Casper could do this well -- Ridley Scott can repeatedly. Why do we get buildings that would be unremarkable even in the real world?"

","I am an unrepentant Harry Potter fan.  I adore the books.  I thought I was going to have the holiday season of a lifetime, with Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings both coming out within a month of each other.<br/><br/>At least there's still Lord of the Rings to salvage the season.<br/><br/>Harry Potter was, in fact, very faithful to the words of the book.  The feeling, however, that one gets in reading Rowling was completely gone.  I didn't care about the characters as much, as Columbus didn't feel any need to tell us anything about them beyond the action on the screen; I didn't have any sense of anticipation, except in one scene in the forest (despite the fact that I have that sense each time I read the books); and I wasn't able to get involved in the story because the cuts from scene to scene were so abrupt (and often non-sensical).<br/><br/>The effects were worse than the plot.  The troll looked like something by Pixar (Pixar is great, mind you, but it's animation and not realistic). Quidditch looked like a contest to see who could be the blurriest. Harry's much-touted digitally green eyes were only green in a couple of very brief shots.  My own model train set in my living room looks better than the Hogwarts Express.  I could go on, but I don't have the space to list all the problems.<br/><br/>My suggestions for the next movie are that the script writer try reading not Rowling's WORDS, but the EMOTIONS she evokes, and that they not rush the production so much that the effects and editing suffer.  I really think that if they hadn't rushed to get this movie done in a year, the effects at least would have been vastly better.<br/><br/>The only saving grace in this movie is Williams' score.  It at least lends a little bit of emotion to an otherwise flat movie.<br/><br/>My recommendation: buy the soundtrack, and wait for the video.  Don't waste your money in the theatre."

","I have not and have no intention of reading the books- nothing against them, they just aren't my cup o'tea. I hesitated seeing this film not because of no interest in those books- but because of the director- I have found his films to be trite and cheap and very formula- straight from the Speilberg school of ""once I've made my first ba-zillion I can sell out and never have to be creative again"". This film has good camera work. It has current state effects. It has a pace akin to running a 24fps film at 1000fps. It's shallow- it asks you to buy into all of it without explanation. There's a fakeness to it leaving me feeling like I had molten Saran-wrap poured over me. I don't care about the characters because they were simply place-holders- no personalities. Harry is so two-dimensional as to make a sheet of paper more intriguing. Perhaps the ""genre"" just doesn't appeal here. Fans (and most people are either a fan or not- no ""in-betweens"") ballyhoo this film with that glazed-eye look of cult religionists. Yuck."

","terribly contrived and juvenile.  From the outset, it treats viewers like they were little children - the problem is, that most children won't realize how terrible it is because they haven't the breadth of experience to notice how contrived and unoriginal the plot is.<br/><br/>I don't blame Columbus though, JK Rowling has created a cliched story full of unoriginality and character shallowness.  The fact that Harry Potter seems to be everybody's favourite and is virtually invincible in the film just makes you feel sick at how predictable this film is.<br/><br/>And the ending - my gosh, what a terrible ending.  Star Wars was bad enough with their super proton topedoes that destroy whole mother ships (and stupid Darth Vader never learnt the lesson of having such weaknesses from his experience in The Phantom Menace).  But Harry Potter tops it with it's ridiculous ending whose sole explanation is a mother's love?

I think J. K. Rowling did a good job in writing the story but the movie makes no sense at all. All the plots are not linked up. The characters are bad. Daniel Radcliffe is a very bad actor. Many other better actors could be chosen. I think he was chosen just because he looks like the Harry Potter on the front cover of the book. The costumes are bad. The special effects are bad.

","Ouch. This film irritated me so much I was in tortuous pain by the end of it. I only really have one reason for despising this film, but this reason is so monumental in its power that it caused me to spend much of the film writhing around on the carpet in agonising spasms, spasms from which I am only just beginning to recover. The reason ladies and gentlemen, is terrible child acting.<br/><br/>The three kids, in particular the girl, are guilty of some of the most trite, sickly sweet overacting ever seen on the silver screen. They reminded me of primary school plays where the most precocious kids in the class are given the leading roles rather than those with any semblance of charisma or acting ability. They somehow fail in portraying any tangible or believable emotion whatsoever. They do however succeed in over-pronouncing every single letter of every syllable of every word as if the Lord of Language himself (possibly Stephen Fry) were watching over them ready to strike them down in the event of a missing 't' in sweet or a missing 'g' in bloody annoying. It is the cinematic equivalent of Maria Carey warbling up and down through every conceivable note in order to try and prove that she can sing; but in doing so exhibiting a pretentiousness that has no place on this earth.<br/><br/>My unofficial award for worst acting performance is currently held by the actor who played young Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace, but these three run him very close indeed.<br/><br/>Someday I will get around to reviewing the film's plot and characters but only when the agony and nausea are fully extinguished from my limbs and I can once again look out upon the world with the asceticism and joyful exuberance that have become my trademark.

"dnagroo","1","11","28","12 July 2003"," Awful, to say the least.
","I've read the book only to see what all the hype's about. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. It was a very easy book to follow and dares to be nothing more than it actually is - a plain old nothing-new-under-the-sun children's book. In that, Rowling did a fine job. Snippets from Lord of the Rings, Dracula, Ender's Game, to name a few, were bluntly used throughout the book and meshed together to form this trashy, 2 cents of a fantasy story. Oh well, as long as it keeps my children reading.<br/><br/>But the movie... oh, well, now that's plain sad. I don't recall ever seeing such forced adaptation of a book to a movie. Everything about this movie is wrong. The younger actors act so bad they seem to take part of some sorry school play, the CG effects are ridiculously unrealistic, the script is just a scribble of the original book's text rather than telling an actual story. And the list goes on.<br/><br/>The fact that Rowling insisted on having only British actors seem to have been the first mine laid on a shaggy path to a bearable movie. Steven Spielberg (who was offered the job) could have done a much better job in directing just as much as Haley Joel Osment (6th Sense, who was suggested by Spielberg for the part) could have been a MUCH more convincing Harry Potter. A whole lot of the experience was missed, as the rest was brutally murdered by idiotic idealism by the author. Plain sad.<br/><br/>The worst part is that such a horror of a movie had earned so much money to its makers. Kinda blows away all wishes of becoming a good, hard-working director... it seems that skill has nothing to do with success. :)<br/><br/>It deserves nothing more than 1/10."
"edwithmj","1","10","25","13 April 2011"," Harry Potter? Couldn't Rowling have thought of a better name?
","First off I'll start on the basics that others have mentioned. The acting is bad from the three child-actors. I thought this might be because they were so young but I've seen the fifth film and it still doesn't improve. Their acting is on a ""school play"" level with over-emphasised lines and facial expressions. Daniel Radcliffe was chosen for this film because he looks like the character but by the fifth film he no longer looks like him. The silly glasses make this slightly better but it's a cheap effect. The ginger kid was annoyance personified and I could write an essay on his irritating habits. I detest the way he uses soft swear words like bloody with that fake working class accent. The girl overdid the ""goody goody girl"" role.<br/><br/>The fact that they were friends from the start and stayed together the whole time was so unbelievable, by the fifth film they're still all together mainly. Rowling obviously copied this from other children's books but it doesn't make it any more believable. Those sort of ""group"" friendships never happen in school in real life.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter""? Couldn't she have thought of a better name. Only ""John Smith"" would have been more generic. A book or film in which the main character is called Harry Potter could be about anything. When I first heard about the books and the plot i.e. a boy who goes to wizard school, I immediately thought that it was just a copy of ""The Worst Witch"" by Jill Murphy. That book is more consistent, has better characters and is a true pleasure to read as a child. Regardless, Rowling's ideas have been done so many times before. I tried Harry Potter and I found it unreadable, how anyone could actually enjoy reading this pap is beyond me. The only explanation of why the books are so popular is because of media hype. The series came about just at the right time and was lucky in that the media and publishing companies were looking for something to hype so as to make a lot of money because the series is so generic and plagiarised it's not even funny.<br/><br/>Other characters were generic too. Robbie Coltrane's character is a standard in many children's books. He's the big, burly gentle giant grounds keeper or whatever who, although being big and strong, is actually very gentle, kind and becomes a friend to the children. The worst thing about this character though his his clichéd west-country accent. Arghhh! It's just so predictable! DumbleBORE is also generic: he's the wise old wizard who is both kind and tough but fair. He even has the big old white beard which practically every wizard in literature also has. There's also the supposed obvious ""evil"" character played by Alan Rickman who surprise surprise turns out not to be evil after all. Was that the big ""twist"" of the film/book? Good Lord, this must be aimed at the 50-90 IQ range. Harry's nemesis is a sort of young blonde Dracula lookalike who also can't act. His badness is never explained, it's obviously hoped by the producers that the watcher will not question why he's Harry's nemesis and just accept that he looks bad, does bad, says bad and that's that.<br/><br/>The story itself lacks imagination regarding the characters (see above), the setting and the plot. Rowling manages to incorporate a large number of overused mythical creatures and objects which causes the story to feel as though a child wrote it to include all her little fantasies. Everyone seems to ride brooms, even the men and boys despite that only witches traditionally rode them (she even gets that wrong); potions are brewed in cauldrons and it's never explained why potions are needed when wands seem able to do everything. I just don't get this ""magic"" thing (perhaps it be because I'm a ""muggle"", ugh horrid cutesy word makes me cringe). Magic seems in large to replace the need for modern technology. In fact, the whole setting at Hog-Farts seems to be a medieval castle where the children write using quills and flame torches hang on the walls. One would be forgiven for thinking that the need for magic would go if they had electricity. Just because magic is a fact of life why have all the other creatures and beasts of folklore to exist? Quidditch. What a ludicrous, pointless game. Despite the use of broomsticks (see above) Rowling still couldn't think up a better game. I had to pause the film to let the silliness of the game sink in: A whole team (yes a team!) of players goes against another in a sort of flying football/polo sort of game in which balls must go through goals to score points. It seems simple and unsilly enough albeit lacking imagination but the fact that each team possesses a player called a ""seeker"" who just flies after a golden ball with wings and if one of them catch it, their respective team wins immediately. What's the point of the rest of the game and players? A team could be winning easily and about to win and then the opposing team's seeker catches the golden ball in the last few seconds and wins! How utterly ridiculous! Why not just make the whole game about catching the golden ball and forget the other players and their task?! The plot of this film is incoherent and dull. The first three quarters are an ego trip for the special effects department and just show generic Harry exploring Hog-Farts with his new generic best buddies and gazing in awe at the wonderments inside. The last quarter is explaining some generic evil wizard who wants to come back from prison or something. Needless to say, generic Harry saves the day and is a hero and his ""house"" wins some cup or something. Big whoop. The old British actors they hired were just to legitimate the whole sordid affair."
"Tin Man-5","1","9","22","18 November 2001"," Great storytelling, no story
","**SPOILERS**Before I briefly state my views, I must confess that I have never read a word of or even picked up a Harry Potter book in all of my life. I had many friends rave and rant about them, and at my work, I often see my co-worker's kids sitting in corners, waiting for their mothers to take them to school, reading the latest chapter in the series enthusiastically. But because I have never read Harry Potter myself, I have no understanding of the series, the characters, or the plotlines outside of the world this movie has created. Therefore, this is a review for viewers like me: They haven't read the books, and they're curious to see what all the hype is about.<br/><br/>Well....judging soley from this film, it's not about much, I can tell you.<br/><br/>Overall, I would rate this film as either a C- or a D+. Since, if you're still reading this review, you've probably already seen the movie, I shall simply state my opinion without elaborating too much on the happenings of the film. There are a lot of cool ideas presented here....A LOT of cool ideas. In fact, I am not ashamed to state that every idea presented was involving and a work of genius....masterpieces to themselves. For the first hour, I was completely engrossed in the world that this movie had created...indeed, this was a magical movie. From the moving stairs to the floating candles and the interacting paintings, this was the stuff of a master artist. Just the goblins set the film apart....never have I seen a film-creature look so convincing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after a while, the wonderful pictures get bogged down and dull due to the absense of a storyline. There was no story or plotline to give this film a firm foundation to stand upon....nothing to move these wonderful ideas that I was watching along. As a result, the move becomes a patch-work of cool-looking ideas, but with no backbone or soul behind them. Eventually, since there is no real storyline, the film just gets old and boring, regardless of how neat the pictures are. I wasn't the only one in the theater drawing these conclusions...indeed, about 90% of the audience were all children, and in the final hour, they were all chattering away to each other, ignoring what was going on in the film, and I could see the parents around them glancing at their watches.<br/><br/>In the last twenty minutes or so, a plot is finally found, but it's so painfully contrived....so cliched and predictable, that it hurts to watch it (i.e. ""You defeated your enemy with love;"" Harry's team winning all the points and earning the trophy, etc.).  This is a pity, because the plotline seemed to be good, and if the director had just cut the film's length in half and spent more time developing this story, we could have had a real winner on our hands, on par with other children's fantasys like ""Wizard of Oz"" and ""E.T.""<br/><br/>Veteran British actors such as Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, John Cleese, John Hurt, and Maggie Smith are wasted in throw-away roles, though the lead youngters certainly aren't bad.<br/><br/>All in all, a dissapointing effort, made even more dissapointing by the fact that there were so many likable qualities to it, among them the ideas presented and the visuals achieved, which set it apart from any other film of its kind. Watching this film has not motivated me to read the books; however, I shall certainly be in line to watch the second film. Hopefully, with a better story for the viewer to follow, the visually and undeniably magical world of Harry Potter will be a truimph the second time around.<br/><br/>*1/2 out of ****"

","I don't read Harry Potter and never intend to. I wasn't even going to see the movie but my conniving and manipulative friend tricked me into seeing it (long story; you wouldn't want to hear it). Needless to say, I did not like the movie, although my 11-year-old brother loved it to death.<br/><br/>First of all, let me state a few things. I do have an imagination. I grew up reading Roald Dahl and have seen ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" at least twice. I thought ""Alice in Wonderland"" was really cool. I have also seen ""James and the Giant Peach"", among many other adaptations of Roald Dahl's books, and I loved it. I'm looking forward to ""Lord of the Rings"", even though I wouldn't read the books. As for the ""E.T."" thing: My mom recommended ""E.T."" to me when one fine night I was at a loss of what to rent at the rental shop. I was reluctant at first, as I thought it was just another kid movie, and I don't usually watch kid movies anymore. I wasn't expecting anything from it but boredom. When the film concluded though, I was in near-tears. In my opinion, by comparing ""Harry Potter"" to such classics like ""E.T."" is a tad insulting to the said film. ""E.T."" was something fresh, even in the year 2001; ""Harry Potter"" was just trite and recycled.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter"" struck me as a mix of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Hercules"" (you know, the TV show starring Kevin Sorbo?) and just about every other fairy tale you've heard. First, there were the cliches. Of COURSE Harry's a poor, abused boy who lives with wicked foster parents! He simply HAS to be, or there wouldn't be a reason why he's such a supposed expert with wizardry. The opening sequences with Harry's foster family totally reeked of the story of ""Cinderella"" (sp?). The mean uncle in ""Potter"" is the mean stepmother in ""Cinderella"", and the obnoxious cousin in ""Potter"" is the obnoxious stepsisters in ""Cinderella"". I really could've done without that whole sob-story designated to evoke pity in the audience; I have heard it before, and I have heard it told better.<br/><br/>Another thing that made me squirm in my seat was its length. Unlike another equally hyped movie, ""Titanic"", 30 minutes of ""Harry Potter"" felt like an hour. When I saw ""Titanic"" though, I was surprised to find that 3 hours had passed in the darkened theatre; it felt like an hour and a half. I didn't understand -- and still don't -- why they couldn't have just cut to the chase and dump Harry in the dungeon hole to face-off with the bad, evil guy. On second thoughts, I also don't understand why they took almost an hour in getting Harry's butt to his magical school, whatever it's called. It was a good one hour wasted, and if you add that hour to the time they took to unravel the very unexciting events that took place after that, like the Quiddich game or however you spell it, you get almost two hours. Two hours of oh-so-spectacular events that were mostly irrelevant to the actual finding of the socerer's stone. If you don't call that tediously slow-paced, then I'm not sure if we saw the same movie.<br/><br/>The boy who played Harry was a terrible mis-cast. I can't imagine how he got the gig in the first place; he has got to be one of the most uninspired child actors I've seen. Even little Anna Paquin in ""Jane Eyre"" (sp) shone in comparison to him, and I didn't think she was all that wonderful in it. His acting was flat, dry and at times, laughable (his portrayal of fear towards the end made me laugh out loud), and even more so when he appeared in scenes with Emma Watson (I think that's her name, she played Hermonie, however one spells it) and Draco, whom I deemed as little Count Dracula. I liked only a few things about the movie, and Draco was among them (another person I liked was Oliver Wood, simply because he's a cute Brit). Emma Watson did well, as did the boy who played Ron and Draco. Child actors are capable of doing their jobs right; it all depends on who we're talking about.<br/><br/>The other thing I liked was its visual effects. I can hate the rest of it, but if I ever want to see it for a second time (probably due to permanent insanity), then it'd be for the effects. The school was pretty, and the floating spirits thingy inside was kind of cute, if not funny, though I don't know if that was the intention of the film-makers. The scene in the woods was also done pretty well; the entire look of the place gave the scene an almost creepy feeling. But it was destroyed when **spoiler** the half-human half-horse character (I forgot what you call them) came out to save Harry. I was just so reminded of the likes of ""Hercules"" that I started laughing. Beside me, my friend went, ""What the hell?"" In fact, she did it quite a lot throughout the whole picture.<br/><br/>I would definitely not recommend it to anyone I love. But judging from the amount of positive comments on this site, I guess a lot of people are going to like it. One advice though: if you're sick of the whole Harry Potter hype, avoid this film like the plague, which was what I intended to do. Trust me, you wouldn't want to see it. It'll just make you want to set fire to its many merchandises even more."

It's just a product reel for all the special effects companies that worked on it.<br/><br/>Seeing actors of the caliber of Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith wading through this, I wondered what went through their minds while they were performing.  They have to eat and pay bills like the rest of us, but the last time I felt so sorry for actors was watching Dudley Moore in SANTA CLAUS.<br/><br/>There's no need for viewers to feel any emotional reaction.  The goshawful musical score by John Williams telegraphs everything to us and makes sleeping during the dull parts nearly impossible.<br/><br/>This made a bundle opening weekend and the studio has started work on the sequel.

","It's hard to imagine just how influential the Harry Potter series has been on my life. It was released around the time I was born, and I can't really ever remember a time when it wasn't my favorite world to escape into. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first book I can remember becoming a fan of, and wanting to read it again straight away. I'm not even going to pretend that I can judge this without bringing over my fondness for the books.<br/><br/>For all the fault this first movie has, it feels like a soon-to-be classic, with many aspects featured here becoming ubiquitous in popular culture. The score by John Williams is recognized worldwide as a magical and wondrous piece of music, conjuring up images of broomsticks, wands, and giant castles hidden in the mountains. Hogwarts Castle itself is now an enormously successful theme park in Florida, Osaka, and more on the way. King's Cross has become a tourist attraction, with hundreds of fans waiting in line to take a picture with the trolley at Platform 9 3/4 every day.<br/><br/>The cast from the very beginning is stock full of British acting royalty, great actors sinking their teeth and relishing every bit of dialogue. The young actors do their best and it's fun to see them start off, knowing what lies ahead for them, both in the course of the series and afterwards as well.<br/><br/>The opening sequences have a real sense of mystery and wonder, possibly enhanced by the knowledge of the truth about Harry's real identity. The introductions to characters and places are perfect, most notably: Diagon Alley, Alan Rickman as Snape, and our first glimpse of Hogwarts.<br/><br/>The story is simple and mostly an excuse for world-building, but what a world to get lost in. In my head, Hogwarts wasn't so...practical, but it looks like a place a child of 11 would consider the most amazing place in the world. The creatures and rules and spells add to the fun.<br/><br/>The film does feature shoddy CGI (the quidditch match is particularly bad) and at 2 and a half hours it is overlong. It's hard to ignore, though, the place in popular culture it has attained and the earnest sense of wonder and fun that it offers to everyone who gives it a chance."

"cosmic_quest","6","3","5","20 May 2006"," A fair first outing for the famous Boy Wizard
","'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' no doubt divided many fans of the 'Harry Potter' novels, of whom I am one. The film adaptation of a much loved book was never going to please everyone and, while it is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, there is no denying that it has both good and bad points.<br/><br/>For those who have just flown in from Pluto, the hero of PS is young Harry Potter, a bi-spectacled British boy who has lived with his brutish relatives since he was orphaned at the age of fifteen months. However, on his eleventh birthday, Harry's life changes forever when he discovers his secret legacy...that he is a wizard. He sets off eager to start his First Year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, making friends with fellow First Years, know-all Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, the sixth son of an impoverished but kindly Pureblooded wizarding family. Yet life is not destined to be all fun and games for as our young hero quickly adapts to this wonderful new world, he learns the disturbing truth behind his parents' deaths and that sometimes evil doesn't die easily.<br/><br/>The quality of the adult actors was just superb. Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Julie Walters and Mark Williams as Molly and Arthur Weasley were all destined to play these roles, truly bringing the characters to life in a way I didn't think would be possible. I was less keen on Richard Harris' Dumbledore, feeling he was just a shade too cold and stand-offish to play an paternal man who the neglected Harry came to trust with ease. That said, the adult cast were definitely the backbone of the film, especially in light of the rather mediocre child cast.<br/><br/>While Daniel Radcliffe may resemble the living embodiment of Harry Potter, it was evident from his lacklustre performance in PS that he was chosen purely on looks rather than talent. At the best of times, he portrayed Harry as a rather bland and uninspiring hero and, at his lower moments, he was just cringe-worthy (the scene where he discovers he is a wizard is particularly clunky). Devon Murray, who played Seamus, and James and Oliver Phelps, cast as the Weasley twins, were equally as wooden. However, there are a few gems in the group. Tom Felton was excellent in bringing the maliciously mischievousness of Draco Malfoy to life and he is, undoubtedly, the best of the bunch. Emma Watson's Hermione was suitably condescending and obnoxious as the character was aged eleven (sadly, come GoF, Emma didn't comprehend that Hermione had largely out-grown the conceitedness was an integral part of her character in PS). While Tom Felton was the best of the child cast overall, Rupert Grint, who played Ron, was the best of the trio, bringing to the character a quiet loyalty to his friend balanced with the boyish exuberance that was very much apparent to eleven-year-old Ron.<br/><br/>The script might be a tad too childish for those over twelve, with not enough focus on the more interesting adult characters, but I believe it suited the mood of the novel given Harry was eleven in PS so viewed the wizarding world in the very innocent, awestruck manner of a child. Director Chris Columbus nicely compliments this by capturing a wondrous, Disney-like feel to Hogwarts in a way that leaves the audience joining Harry in his delight at exploring the magic of the wizarding world. The special effects are acceptable with the exception of the cartoony Quidditch match, which seems to have been lifted straight from the Nintendo video game and awkwardly pasted to the film, and the hideously computerised centaur.<br/><br/>PS was a fair adaptation, enjoyable in itself although no-where near the epic of LotR. It does capture the innocence of the characters at a time when they believed the world was neatly divided into good and evil and magic could sort any problem, however, older fans will most likely find the faster, mature pace of the adaptations of the latter novels more suited to their tastes as, in comparison, PS seems to be directed mainly at little fans under twelve."

","How on earth did this get up to the lofty heights of an 8.1 rating?<br/><br/>I have never read the books, but went to see the film on the back of a good rating here, and many critics saying how good it was.  This film was awful. I'd give it a 5/10 for reasonable sets, costumes, effects and making me laugh (twice). I actually voted it as a 1/10 though to hopefully give some more realism to it's rating.<br/><br/>The quidditch game is pathetic. I thought we british invented good games, you know tennis, golf, football, etc. If it's a good game, we invented it. JK Rowling supposedly is british, but judging by this poorly thought through piece of crap she's gotta be american (or worse).<br/><br/>The ginger lad gets praised for ""the best game of chess ever played at hogwarts"" or something, and yet we get to see none of the game other than him making the worst possible first move available to him. An untrained chimpanzee could have guessed a better move. Out of the 20 or so things he could have done how does this master-chess-boy make the worst possible move???<br/><br/>The plot is terrible and full of holes, the biggest seeming to be: Why the hell didn't the badguy use his knowledge to get past the dog earlier? He'd known for half the film, but still only just gets there before Harry who only learns at the end how to bypass the dog!<br/><br/>I thought no matter what that the film is at least choc full of top quality actors and no matter what it will therefore be at least ""ok"". How wrong I was... None of the good actors get anything more than tiny bit parts, and mainly even then they act way below standard - but what can be done with this script?<br/><br/>All in all, don't see this unless you are a fan of the book, or have some money & time that you absolutely must waste."

The script is a fairy tale, which takes itself way too seriously, making the story as dull and predictable as possible. The camera work is so standard, you can predict the angle of the next shot.

The scene where he is told that he is a wizard makes me want to cry. Also the character of run could have had some more insightful lines than ""bloody hell"". I really was expecting this to be great knowing how good the book was but the film let me underwhlemed. Some character also completely miss the mark. Draco malfoy is way over done, instead of being snidely nasty but in this comes across as pantomime bad. The only upshot of the film is Alan Rickman's Snape is spot on, Robbie coltrane just about makes a reasonable Hagrid but Emma Watson's Hermione is surprisingly good and upstages the other two so much that it makes some timid scenes almost seem watchable.<br/><br/>In summary the book could have made a great Oscar wining film but Chris Columbus has failed and has succeeded in making a timid adventure movie with poor acting"

Now believe me i give the books very little credit as they are predictable, boring and predictably boring, but even i can see that the films, especially harry potter and the philosopher's stone, are a poor portrayal of a dull book.<br/><br/>The acting is actually painful. I read a review of the film saying that credit should go to some performances. There are no performances, granted it would take a hell of a display to make this film entertaining, but the actors chosen don't even have a go.

"TheMovieeGuy","1","7","17","12 December 2001"," The movie is SO overrated, Lord of the Rings will RULE!
","I have seen both Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings during the past couple of weeks. Both have an unbelieveable amount of hype behind them, and both films are based on extremely popular fantasy book however, that's where the difference ends. Harry Potter is just hype and Lord of the Rings is what delivers. But, that's another review. Harry Potter is an eleven year old boy living in England with his irritating aunt and uncle who really don't care for him. He is wisked away to become a wizard at Hogwarts school of wizards. From there he makes a lot of friends and learns to become a wizard. He plays games on broomsticks, and fights a lot of fake looking monsters. And in the end, he meets the evil wizard who killed his parents. Now, the film isn't that bad, but it's really silly and got quite boring after a while, some of the sequences were ripped off from The Phantom Menace, (The Quidditch match, etc) Anyways, kids love it, I didn't A 3 out of 10, decent special effects, and sets, but, a bland, and unoriginal script that only children who are diehard fans of the book will enjoy.

There, in his first year with his friends Ron and Hermione, he must stop wrongdoing of a couple teachers. The cast was wonderfully casted. Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic and looks the part of Harry.

"thesar-2","3","5","11","3 March 2013"," Harry Potter's Philosopher's Sorcerer's Drawl
","First off, I am going to give my modern day thoughts on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone since I just now watched it for the first time in about 10½ years. And then, I will tell my story. I will begin with the positives to be nice. To be generous.<br/><br/>80% of the special effects and sets worked extremely well with the exception of showing both The Man With No Nose – oops, I'm jumping ahead, I mean: The Man's Name They Only Speak Of Seldomly and ANY flying sequence including that Rubbish, er, I mean Quidditch game. Also, the film was a perfect fantasy for youngVERY YOUNG, that is, kids. Oh, and the score was unbelievably great.<br/><br/>Whew. Got that out of the way. Okay, here goes: the movie was too damn long. The movie contained a minuscule amount of plot – or direction and the bulk was just spliced together scenes of a freshman year at a unique school. Quite frankly, it felt like 1,001 ideas and made up names (for useless characters, random spells, odd or clichéd wizardry creatures and places) were basically thrown at us while hero Wesley Crusher, a.k.a. Harry Potter, attempts to figure out what the whole point to this mess is.<br/><br/>What started off very nicely in a fantasy and magic-filled-world slowly grinded to a halt so they could show off more fantastic sets and a zillion characters and objects in a school bent on kidnapping kids to learn sorcery. Eventually, it takes about an hour and forty-five minutes or roughly fifteen minutes past what this movie should've been clocked at, to learn what our ""hero"" (??) Harry Potter should accomplish before the credits roll.<br/><br/>By that point, I kept repeating two phrases over and over: ""I don't like this movie"" (despite the graphics and the wonder it's showing me) and that this is really made for the five and under crowds. Further, when the movie finally did get past the climax of what Harry & Pals (including his poor idiot ginger chap and know-it-all-bitch with terrible hair) need to accomplishthere are FIVE endings. This movie would never, ever, ever, ever end.<br/><br/>Oh, and before the judgments roll in, I *have* read the book. Book one, that is. I found it's all-but exactly, word-for-word as the adaption. And that's not necessarily a good thing. Despite its approximately 300 pages, enormously large print, wide margins and drawings – all of which would make it approximately 3 chapters of any normal Stephen King fare – it's just as plot less as the movie until the end. All the way through both the book and movie, I kept fantasying about other movies/books I could be entertained by that contained a point to the story from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Now, that all said, it's not a terrible movie. It's a good intro to what's to come and again, it's PERFECT for very young kids. Is it a movie I will ever revisit, or as now, re-watch in another 11 years? Hell no. Now, that I can finally write a review, I never have to experience Harry's seemingly never-ending freshman year at Hogwart's school.<br/><br/>And now here's my take on my original screening<br/><br/>A Long Time Agoin our own galaxy, sort of, I watched Harry Potter Part One – since it's known by two different names, for asinine reasons, I will refer this as ""Part One"" – only due to a babysitting gig I was coaxed into. I had already made up my mind not to see this film, since swords/wizards/fantasy isn't my cup of British TeaBut, since I had seven hours of babysitting two young boys, I thought: why not take up an hour and a half on a movie they'll probably want to see?<br/><br/>That was mistake one and two: forgoing my vow and that I mistakenly thought it would be an hour and a half. Mistake number three was that we went on weekend one or two – I can't recall, or I choose not to – so, the theatres and parking lot were still jammed. We barely made our show time after parking and getting snacks.<br/><br/>Despite being tortured (SEE ABOVE REVIEW) for the movie's duration, I was pleased I had just used up 5 of the 7 babysitting hours with the journey there, movie and back. As for the boysboy, they LOVED the movie. They LITERALLY sat on the edge of their seats the entire time. (No joke.) Good for them. I'm glad the money I spent on their entertainment and their snacks was well worth it.<br/><br/>I, on the other hand, was squirming in my seat the entire time or at least after the first pointless hour. I had NO IDEA that this was over an hour and a half, let alone 2½+ hours – I was so disinterested in seeing this, I had completed no research. NO KID MOVIE SHOULD EVER BE THAT LONG – I originally thought. Not to mention, no kids movie should contain FIVE ENDINGSas stated above: the movie would never, ever end.<br/><br/>Again, I remember the boys, one of which is my (now 15-year-old) nephew, loved every single minute and as uncomfortable as I was, I'm sincerely glad they had a good time. In fact, I need to make a point of asking him if he remembers me taking him. He had to be between 4-5 at the time<br/><br/>A year later, I would be dragged into seeing the remake/sequel with my partner and suffice to sayI could write the same damn review all over again.<br/><br/>(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years.)"

","This movie is pretty good, It's an enjoyable movie.
It manages to set up the wizarding world and it never felt slow paced when they did it.
There is some flaws to this movie and i will say them.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
Harry is a bland protagonist.
He never shows emotion and when magical stuff happens in the beginning he never feels shocked that those stuff happen.
HISTORY
We get to know Harry's history and that's basically what the Harry potter franchise is about
DESIRE
His desire is to know what the three headed dog is guarding and figuring out the mystery of the philosopher's stone.
VILLAIN
The villain barely get's shown in the movie and that's something i will address later.
You can keep the villain a secret to the audiences but only if you manage to develop the suspects that might be the villain but they didn't do that but again i will talk about the villain later.
CHANGE
Harry dosen't change.
I will give it benefit of the doubt and say that they will develop him in future installments but at least some development needs to be done.
Even Ron and Hermione change as characters it's not a lot of change but it's still there.
Hermione has a closer relationship with Ron and Harry and Ron has a closer relationship with Hermione.
The change is very minimal but it's there while Harry never changes as character and grows but hopefully this will be achieved in future installments.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
They could have develop Snape and Quirrell more as characters cause Snape was the suspect and Quirrell was the Villain and they felt underdeveloped.
Snape will be developed as a character in future installments but Quirrell just felt like a waste.
I will excuse Snape's lack of development but not Quirrell's.
Quirrell is a wasted villain.<br/><br/>VERDICT
Oh gosh this review is trash.
I will still send this cause i could not be bothered to make a better one.
I need to start to put more time and thought into these reviews."

","If you watch ""Sorcerer's Stone"" without reading the book first, there are certain narrative points that you will miss or not quite be as clear on (as usual). However, watching the movie closely following the reading experience will actually expand upon the Potter myth (I gave the first book four stars) due to this film's ability to lay the groundwork of the series in such stunning visuals and characters.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Sorcerer's Stone"" sees young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) living with his aunt and uncle and being mistreated horribly (sleeping in a closet under the stairs, told how rotten he is all the time, etc.). Right before his 11th birthday, however, Harry begins receiving letters from a mysterious owl (as well as a visit from a rather large gentleman riding a flying motorcycle) informing him that he is in fact from wizard lineage. Thus, Harry is whisked away to Hogwarts, a ""Wizard Academy"" of sorts, to begin his training. While at Hogwarts, Harry meets new friends Ron (Rupert Grint) & Hermoine (Emma Watson) as well as discovers the mystery behind the death of his parents regarding a shadowy character called Voldemort.<br/><br/>In terms of following the novel, this film does a pretty good job of keeping in lock-step. There are certain scenes that are excised for time/continuity and a few ""facts"" from the book that are blatantly different from the movie, but other than that it is a great representation.<br/><br/>In fact, in a departure from the norm, I actually enjoyed the movie experience better than the book. Why? Because of the way it was able to so wonderfully put a visual to all the great characters. For some, the ""mystery is gone"" when they see their literary characters up on the big screen, but in this case I was very pleased to put a face to all these great characters.<br/><br/>The movie also has (just like the book) a sense of ""epic-ness"" to it. It is very clear that this is only the beginning of an epic series, with more and more mysteries and character development to come.<br/><br/>Thus, ""Sorcerer's Stone"" is a great cinematic experience that will leave you wanting more as soon as it concludes. The mysteries and characters are paced perfectly, and the story (as it is geared for young adults in the first place) is easy enough to latch onto while nuanced enough to get sucked into."

"Dohsoda","9","2","3","6 November 2016"," One of the Most Magical Films of the Twenty-First Century
","I love this film. Yes, nostalgia has a lot to do with my love, but I don't care. This film came out when I was seven years old and I was in first grade. My mother and father took me to our local movie theater to see it. Harry Potter book mania was in full swing and the phenomenon with the wonderful film series was about to explode with joy. Re- watching the films in order now I can look back on this film with a certain point of view. The first three H.P. films feel like stand alone stories and for the most part set up about 70% of the saga. Now that's was ""Sorcerer's Stone is"" a wonderful world building movie that keeps getting built upon with each new film.<br/><br/>The greatness of ""Sorcerer's Stone"" are that it get's everything right 100%. For an adaptation, it follows the book faithfully. Granted there are elements and chapters omitted, but that's the adaptation process. The cast of youthful and seasoned actors are wonderful. Everyone is cast perfectly and each movies the actors grow into their parts with ease and perfection. The Cinematography is colorful and dark, the musical score by the ingenious John Williams is beautiful and magical, the direction by Chris Columbus is sharp as well.<br/><br/>Even though this film is not perfect, no movie really is anyway, I love it. Any criticisms I have with the film generally go with the whole series. Some films do go on too long.The pace in this particular film can drag on. The plot does have an Indiana Jones vibe where it is one even after the other. Some films in the series are plot driven like ""Chamber of Secrets"" and ""Goblet of Fire"" and some are character driven like ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Half-Blood Prince"". ""Sorcerer's Stone"" ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Deathly Hallows"" are a combination of both character development and plot development. There really is not much for me to nit-pick about this film. It's easy for people to complain about the special effects, but for the film that was establishing the series, the computer generated effects are fine. In my opinion, the whole film series have special effects that range from wonderful to mediocre. But that's just time catching up to the movies.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is wonderful. It's a happy origin tale about the boy who lived and it's full of action, humor, danger, wonder, magic, and most importantly, heart. Fifteen years after its release, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a golden fantasy-family film classic."
"ThomasDrufke","8","2","3","26 October 2016"," What a Brilliantly Fun Way to Begin a Monumental Franchise
","If for nothing else, the Harry Potter films always find a way to give me a great sense of nostalgia. I, like many others, grew up with this franchise. In many ways, this was our generation's Star Wars. It was the 2000's pop culture phenomena. I'm happy to say that the first film, The Sorcerer's Stone, still undoubtedly holds up.<br/><br/>I feel like I should first mention just how impressive it is that Warner Bros and their casting directors found the perfect Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Yes, the rest of the film is also impeccably casted with Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, and Tom Felton just to mention a few, but it's the core three characters that carry this franchise. Watching the three of them play off each other so effectively at such a young age is truly awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>Granted, heroes are only as good as their villains, and luckily they have a great one in Lord Voldemort. Even though in Sorcerer's Stone it's hard to really call him in the big-bad, considering he's not resurrected yet, but his presence is definitely felt. With that said, I wish they would have involved Professor Quirrell more in the main plot. He's a sketchy guy, but you never get a real sense that he's working to resurrect Voldemort.

"cathyemocling","9","2","3","13 August 2016"," Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is about a journey of a boy in exploring his true identity as being a wizard.
","(EAPP11_REV2016) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone is the very first book in the J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Its film or movie remake was released in November 2001 directed by Chris Columbus and produced by David Heyman. As you know, some call this film the Philosopher's Stone and some call it the Sorcerer's Stone. The explanation behind this is that the ""Philosopher's Stone"" is the British name and the ""Sorcerer's Stone"" is the American name. For those who haven't watch the movie yet, I'm going to give you a little glimpse. There was once a boy whose true identity was suppressed from him by the family who kept him for 11 years. When he turned 11, someone came to reveal his true identity which changed his life for the better. That boy is Harry Potter. He entered a school of Witchcraft and Wizardry named Hogwarts. Here he discovered a whole lot about himself and developed friends. This is where the all the magic began. If you would compare the book from the movie, there are some parts or chapters in the book that was not included in the film and there are some that were in the movie but not in the book. Nevertheless, the portrayal of the book in the movie was still great and those parts that weren't included in the movie did not affect the plot of the story unlike other movie remakes of other novels where they completely changed the plot line. If you want to know the chapters or parts that were not included in the movie, you may want to read the book first before watching it. The cinematography is quite amusing because knowing that it was released in 2001 where technology wasn't that advance as it is today. The graphics or visual effects were okay because it doesn't look like that it was fake or that edited. Of course, as the series go on with the other films, the effects were highly improved as technology evolved. The choice of music perfectly fits the movie because for me, classical music best fits the theme of magic and mystery. I can't imagine the film with songs or music that have lyrics or are of different genre. The choices of stars/artists were perfect where Daniel Radcliffe starred as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. They were really adorable in the movie because they still have that young charisma that's why it doesn't matter who or what age is the person that'll watch this because they'll feel that it is not old. I can't even imagine anyone who can portray the role of Harry Potter if it was not Daniel Radcliffe because even if he starred in other movies I'll always call him Harry. Harry Potter was released for a long time now yet more and more people, children and adults, are still very fond of it. Even if they weren't born in the earlier years of 2001, Potterheads will always come back to the very first episode of the Harry Potter Series. I, myself is a big fan of this. There are a whole lot of plot twists and mysteries that are shown in this movie as well as in the other movies of the series. I'm telling you, Harry Potter will take you to another world full of enchantments that'll make you believe in magic."

","I think this movie is very attractive to me. The Harry Potter film series is the world's highest grossing film series with over $ 7.7 billion in multi-national release. British writer J · K · Rowling's fantasy literature series novel describes the protagonist Harry Potter's 7 years of study at Hogwarts life adventure story, directed by Chris Columbus. Harry is the hero of the story. He is an adventurous child, I have to search for information about Harry display state among the living, so in real life Harry is a very brave and very clever boy. The film's score is also superb, seven out of ten, but the real wizards are JK Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew bring it to life. Thanks to this movie I have some knowledge of magic stories. I will always support Harry."

","J.K. Rowling's movie ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone"" was truly a remarkable representation of her book, naturally guiding her readers and many more to see it. <br/><br/>J.K. Rowling's book was a huge hit worldwide, selling 107 million copies around the globe. It is clearly fictional, but shows the magical world is hidden from the average world, giving the audience a sort of real sense of the movie.<br/><br/>Tension was high with the film-makers, for the expectation of the movie was massive, forcing the screenwriters to stay very true to the text and not stray from the original plot. <br/><br/>The soundtrack used was very vital in making the film, and it's franchise popular. It's many catchy tunes can make you scared, smile or chuckle. <br/><br/>It is a story about an 11 year old, named Harry Potter, who found out he is a very popular and powerful wizard. Though it sounds like it makes life easier, Harry's fame gives him lots of pressure and many problems. <br/><br/>Being the first movie of its series, ""The Philosopher's Stone"" largely focused on describing the Wizardous surroundings, specifically the setting and the odd, standing out characters. <br/><br/>Finally released from his horrible family to go fulfil his potential at the wizard school of Hogwarts, Harry begins to feel free. Then weird events and odd things begin to happen.<br/><br/>A truly remarkable scene was the bathroom fight scene. Considering it was made more than a decade ago, it was one of the most advanced CGI scenes for it's time, making it much more exciting on screen. This goes as well for the life size, life or death chess match and the intense encounter with Voldomort in the dark, frightening, forest.<br/><br/>The scenery is remarkable and seems to make the film. Whether it's the packed and wizards filled streets of diagon alley or the looming halls of Hogwarts, the settings always seem to amaze and astound. <br/><br/>The old, young and strong cast give the characters a quirky charisma and likable attitude. Richard Harris as the old and astute Headmaster Dumbledore, Robbie Coltrane as the humorous and captivating giant Hagrid, Alan Rickman is the potentially evil Professor Snape. And of course the young and charming Daniel Radcliffe as Harry potter, Emma Watson as the cheeky but intelligent Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as the dull but witty Ron Weasley. Oscar winning Maggie Smith seems born for the roll of the smart professor McGonagall.<br/><br/>This movie received amazing results, due to its accuracy from the book and exciting plot. An amazing love for the film spread through the world like a disease. People were begging for a sequel, and in return, 6 more movies were released in a matter of 10 years, creating a combined total revenue of 7.7 billion dollars. <br/><br/>The Harry Potter series is one of my favourite film and movie series because of it's sometimes wacky and sometimes serious scenes. It makes me laugh and grimace. It is widely considered the best movie series ever and it should be."
"lesleyharris30","8","2","3","18 October 2015"," An Absolute Delight for Children of all Ages,
","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a talented cast. It's a delight to watch, I've seen this movie numerous times and it never fails to make me smile, to cheer me up when I'm feeling down, the Harry Potter franchise is magical both inside and out, and it's simple fun to watch Harry go in to his first year at Hogwarts, the story's quite simple as the series kicks off with a light start, but it will still leave you wanting more. The films biggest flaw is, at times, it is too faithful to the book that it is based off, I'm sure this is pleasing for anyone who's read the book, but for those who haven't it tends to drag out at times, more than an hour passes before Potter even goes to Hogwarts and the main adventure dosen't unfold properly until at least one hundred minutes in, it can get a little tedious at times and that's why I'm giving it an eight instead of a nine that it easily could have received. The cast is outstanding, the young cast members are ridiculously talented for their age, Daniel Radcliffe seems to have no trouble playing a lead role, and both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson shine as his closest friends, they never lose a single bit of likability. They are joined by a terrific adult cast, including the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and, the highlight of the movie for me, Richard Harris, he shines as Professor Dumbledore (sadly only for two movies), his characterization is perfect, he is wise, heartwarming and simply a lovable character. It may be a bit slow at times, but Harry Potter and the Philiosopher's Stone never loses its sense of fun and magic, and because of this it is a perfect film for the whole family to watch and enjoy. <br/><br/>A young boy learns the truth about his special powers, that he is a wizard and must prove his worth at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Richard Harris Worst Performance: James Phelps"
"Horst_In_Translation","8","2","3","25 December 2014"," Year 1 at Hogwarts
","""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" or sometimes also ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" is the first film from one of the most successful movie franchises in cinema history. The books were written by Joanne K. Rowling and adapted by Steve Kloves (not a name to many), who also directed ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" earlier in his career. It is about a small boy with hidden powers, who is not particularly liked by his uncle, aunt and cousin. They took care of him after his parents died when he was a baby. So he gets picked up by an unusually looking, rather gruff magician and taken to Hogwarts. Hogwarts is not a normal school. While the bonding with fellow students, the fraternities and sports activities are there as well, everything is just a little bit more magical and different.<br/><br/>One thing I really liked about the film was the playful comedy. A lot of it involved Ron Weasley. It is very subtle often, but it is pretty great. Let me use one example. When Potter finds a collection card in one of his sweets, he says he has Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster from Hogwarts. Now I expected something like Weasley saying oh my God he only appears once in a 1,000 times, but he said something like he has him six times already too. And when Dumbledore's card comes alive and quickly vanishes, Weasley says that Albus cannot hang around there all day as he is busy. I found that pretty funny and there is a whole bunch of cute scenes like that, also Weasley's interactions with Hermione for example.<br/><br/>Other than that the film really succeeds with his love to detail and all the fantastic ideas in the script, such as the hat picking the group they belong to, the hidden station idea, the scar, the troll (like a fire alarm in a real school), Fluffy, the mirror, the chess game and many more. To me, the first movie was much more about experiencing the wonderful world of Hogwarts than really enjoying the adventure action about the stone. Another highlight are all the very unique characters from the teaching staff. I won't go into further detail here. You know who I mean. There's some minor criticisms, like the ending with the extra points was a bit cheesy, feel-good forced (also with Smith's character looking so uncomfortable, they have to be neutral I thought), the connection between Snape's wound and Fluffy was a bit genius, don't know if kids would make it really so quickly, but they have bright minds so maybe or also Ron's whole self-sacrificing approach during the chess game. I can't really see a little boy act like that. These are only minor flaws though from an otherwise excellent film. This is one to watch for the whole family and I can't say I am surprised this was the most successful box office movie in the United States from 2001, even ahead of the first Lord-of-the-Rings movie. The three child actors here had little (Radcliffe) to none (Watson, Grint) acting-experience in movies when they were were cast here. A decision that changed their lives.<br/><br/>The movie scored 3 Oscar nominations for the art direction, costumes and the soundtrack and it is surely deserving. Especially the visual side is incredibly strong and over 13 years later, most films can only dream of coming close to that. All the creatures look so fantastic it is a joy to watch. That one forest creature that saves Harry reminded me during one shot especially of the later film ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Just a random notion. There is some animal included like a majestic and, at the same time, cute cuddly owl and a droll huge dog. The cast includes quite a few known actors: Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, John Hurt and many more shall follow in the next films. This movie may be director Chris Columbus' best work so far and that's not taken for granted as he directed 2 ""Home Alone""-films, Mrs. Doubtfire and also another Harry Potter movie during his long career. I believe this is my favorite Potter film together with the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". Too close to call. We are just introduced to such a wonderfully creative world here. Highly recommended."

","OK, so i know that most people think this movie is great and good and blablabla, but i can't get the concept of the story. I have seen many good movies with sorcerers an witches and magic and stuff, but this is the most ridiculous of them all (not that i find the other story's so ridiculous).<br/><br/>The story doesn't have any backbone (what i mean is that the characters are developed poorly)(i am not saying anything about the books, because personally i didn't have the time to read them).<br/><br/>I can't explain, but the feeling isn't there with this movie: you have the old time boring good versus evil, without any surprises in the plot. I knew that is was gonna get to a fight between harry and voldemort (the only thing that was a bit of a surprise to see who was voldemort)<br/><br/>On the otherhand the movie gets a few plusses for the beautiful scenery and some of the costumes.<br/><br/>So, i would give this movie a fat 5/10"
"yodapoo2000","1","8","21","16 February 2005"," why don 't they just take a dump on a filmstrip?
","For a start, the correct title of the book is 'Harry Potter and the PHILOSOPHER'S Stone'. Could the retitling of the film have anything to do with the fact that the only audience for this film is actually too dense to have any clue in hell as to what a philosopher is, or for that matter, be able to read it. I think that it's time for a lesson in language from Yodapoo:<br/><br/><ul><li>P-H-I-L-O-S-O-P-H-E-R: Now that wasn't hard was it? Let's find out what it means. - To take an etymological perspective: it comes from the Athical Greek words ""phileisthai"" - to love and ""sophia"" - wisdom; now let's see if you can muster enough brain cells to decipher what this could mean (hint: it's a noun) </li></ul><br/><br/>Hmmm... the word 'philosopher' doesn't seem to be as linguistically complicated as some may think. Maybe whoever had the final word on what the film would actually be named woke up one morning and mistook his caffeine pills for 'stupid pills'. Idiots.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, the people who made it bought a cauldron, filled it with cinematic turd, brought it to an even boil and carried out the following recipe (for disaster):<br/><br/><ul><li>Child actors as untalented as they are over paid. - An already poor and unbelievable plot. - A distinct lack of any thing at all: the film was not funny, dramatic, scary, adventurous or any other adjective which I can't be bothered to think of right now.</li></ul><br/><br/>In short, this film bites. If you haven't already had the misfortune of watching this cinematic failure, do not- save yourself! This film has less cinematic merit than a blank screen. Once again, avoid this film; disassociate yourself with this film or anything to do with it."

","It is impossible to imagine a world now, in 2020, that does not include these characters from the fantastically creative imagination of JK Rowling. That she worked closely with Chris Columbus in the creation of this adaptation of her introductory story featuring the boy-wizard means it stays broadly faithful to the book but allows the imagery to replace, rather than duplicate, the narrative. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson validate the best in the casting director's art as we set off on this wonderfully enjoyable fantasy adventure. The supporting cast - Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, ZoÃ« Wanamaker et al all add richness to this as young ""Mr. Potter"" and is friends begin to realise their magical potential. John Williams' works his wonders creating a score almost as recognisable as his ""Star Wars"" theme and the special effects are gentle, yet sophisticated.

"rccgalaxy","9","1","1","18 February 2020"," A perfect beginning
","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was the first installment of the saga to be adapted to the cinema, under the direction of Chris Columbus.
This movie is probably the most faithful to the book, not for that better, along with its sequel.
In this first installment, we are presented with the beginning of the great adventure, the friendship of the protagonists, the villain and his greed, and the power of love. All in a story a bit simple but very effective.
The story without being too elaborate, more than fulfills its mission and helps us understand the story of Harry, how a child who had grown apart from everything, would be forced little by little to bear the weight of the world.
At the same time we are presented with many characters with whom we easily become fond of: Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, professors McGnagall and Dumbledore.
It does a great job introducing all the characters (good actors who look like their book counterparts) and the magical world, giving us a magnificent representation of Hogwarts and the Quidditch.
The film has many good scenes with which he gradually explains the plot and teaching the evolution of the characters, leaving us many moments for posterity. One of them may be the first scene in which the history and scene of the chess game is introduced in a great way, with a great direction and editing behind, giving us a scene of tension and epicity.
It is worth mentioning the magnificent John Williams BSO that left us with some of the best themes in film history such as: Hedwig's Theme, Harry's Wondrous World, The Quidditch Match and Leaving Hogwarts.
Certainly a very enjoyable movie, something childish, but suitable for the movie. A very good adaptation of a good book."

As I remember this film was one of the first films arranged for children around 7-12 years old, so it was like present for me.
Set in early nineties, this story takes place in London. The plot revolved around Harry Potter, whose parents where murdered by one of the greatest dark wizards of all time Lord Voldemord. Despite the fact that he was with his mother when she died, he survived, the fact that made him famous in wizarding world. He used to live with his cruel relatives, Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, but now he is about to leave their house to learn magic in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Daniel Radcliffe, actor who played titular protagonist, despite the fact that he was only twelve when first of Harry Potter movies released, could perfectly show all emotions little Harry felt all over this story. As movie about magic, it is exciting and breathtaking, with perfect decorations and interesting plot twists. It has bewitching magical effects, that makes you believe in reality of what is happening. A bonus is perfectly matched themes, like well-known ""Hedwig Theme"". The adventures of little boy and his friends will grab you out and never leave you until movie ends.
This is one of the best films about magic in many years. Not one generation grown watching this movie. I hardly advice you to watch it and plunge in atmosphere of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

Seems like, I was missing that feather pen to wrote it down.<br/><br/>Harry Potter, changed the dimensions of my life. I escaped my reality countless times while watching this film. I was in 8th standard when I watched the cinematic world of Harry Potter.
Being a Small Town Pakistani Boy, It was really hard for me to live in the reality. Always wanted to be the part of the famous trio. As years commenced, I always wishes to have freinds like Harry, who were brave to stood up for their friends. A female friend like Hermione Granger, with her wit she can help to course with social and academic life but this was just a dream. There are millions around the globe who have viewed it.<br/><br/>Chris Coloumbus magnificentlly crafted the Wizardly World of Harry Potter. I really loved his direction, the way he captured the metaphors of the first novel was aesthetic. Campus, classrooms, dormotories, dining room, Hogwarts, Quiditch, we feel to be stuck in there and When Hagrid waves to the trio in the End, that scene seems like a 3rd act to wave to the audience to go back in your reality, the world is waiting you.<br/><br/>Emma Watson shines through her role of hermione granger. Her cleverness and wit make her character memorable. I liked her british accent, the words sounds symphonic and melodical.
Daniel Radcliffe was truly the Boy who lived. He was innocent yet brave. Robert Grint supported him well throughtout the film. Tom Felton did great in the limited version of Draco Malfoy, wanted to see him more when I was kid.
Richard Harris was calm, affectionate version of Albus Dumbeldore. His countenance makes him the Grandfather figure of Harry.
Robbie Coultrane as Hagrid leaves an imprint which makes him the most loveable character in the series. His performance makes me emotional in the end.
Alan Rickman was compeling, Maggie Smith charming and IAN Hart as Voldemort voice freaking genius. Rest of the cast shines in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Music of this film holds a special place in my life, It is a trapdoor to the days of my adolesence, I find myself in my school all the time.

","The right way to start a saga like this one, introducing the characters in a very positive and unique way, telling and showcasing all the riches that the wizard's world is a home of. In only one movie, we've seen amazing creatures, friendly and foes, teachers that are heroes and villains, we've witnessed the wisdom of the legendary professor Dumbldor, the movie made us guess who will be who and on who's side in the chapters to come and above all, we had fun. I will never forget the part where Harry buys all the things he needs to start his wizard journey, the authentic look of the streets, the shops and the bank will be part of the Harry Potter legacy forever."

"ryanh-00630","8","1","1","18 August 2019"," The Magic Begins.
","With every major franchise, trilogy, etc. everything must start somewhere, and to most people the first two installments in the Harry Potter franchise always seem to have negative reviews. I don't blame them, some things feel a little out of order and some things are dated but nevertheless Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone makes for a true fun and entertaining film unlike most.<br/><br/>I, in simple terms, can describe my feelings toward the entire franchise as love. Director Chris Columbus turned an already stellar book series, by the ever so wonderful J.K. Rowling, into a monumental experience that resonates with audiences off all kind. He films with such an enthusiastic way and wants to open everyone to this wonderful world of wizards. In two and a half hours Columbus sets up the way for many sequels to come and fits all the exposition in ever so slightly, that doesn't feel shoved in or too much to handle.<br/><br/>Over my years I've seen some pitch-perfect casting choices and with this it results in sheer brilliance as I watch Daniel Radclifee, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson be their characters. They're in no way ""great"" but they have their charisma and play off each other great. Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, and Maggie Smith are a different story, they excell in their characters and show their ability as actors. Each and every actor portraying anyone is so beautifully perfect, I could never see anyone else playing them. Using his 30 year career to his advantage, composer John Williams makes a rich and true score that any person, fan or not, can reconcile with.<br/><br/>It may not LOOK as magical as it once did but the magic is still there in a film adaptation so close to the original it's uncanny. Sure compared to the time of release and to its sequels Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone may seem outdated and not up to par, but it still results in an excellent story crafted by Chris Columbus, that introduced the world to Harry Potter for years to come."
"elkanah13","Null","1","1","17 August 2019"," Amazing Opening to a masterpiece Book Series! 😊
","It's my first time reviewing so it may not be my best :) After reading the book I watched the movie to give a nice comparison. First, the adaption of the visual magical places is a pure masterpiece, especially how Hogwarts is shown, something you can't see in the book. The film is general is amazing by content and even folks who haven't read the book, would understand, because there is no need to read is you don't want to... Loved how they made the characters, especially Snape, who is my favourite due to amazing acting by Alan Rickman R.I.P. However, some of the transitions between the scenes were awkward to me, due to the need to fill the major scences of 300+ pages to the 2.5 hours, and they should've made the introduction to Harry's life before going to Hogwarts, a little longer. But all in all, it's a nice movie to kids and adults who love science fiction and are ready to get inside a new magical world 😎"

","Harry Potter is a child left at the door of his uncles' house after the early death of his parents by a bearded old man, a small giant and a cat woman when he was just a baby. He is a green-eyed boy who wears split glasses and has messy black hair. He also had a special feature, a ray-shaped scar on his forehead. The uncles hated him and treated him very badly. He slept in a cupboard under the stairs and was constantly badly treated by his fat cousin. One day they went to the zoo and Harry trying to talk to a snake made the glass disappear without knowing how.<br/><br/>A few days before his 11th birthday Harry begins to receive mesterial letters brought by owls. The bad uncles do not let him receive the mail, and in one that the house fills with letters, the uncle picks up everybody and flees to an island and they spend the night in a tent. The next day will be Harry's birthday and at midnight a very tall man will break the door and say harry your a wizrd and take the boy with him. Before, he still gives the cousin a pig's tail for trying to steal the cake he brought to Harry.<br/><br/>The man tells Harry everything he did not know, that he was a wizard and would study at the best school in the world, hogwarts, for boys like him. He takes him to the witch market to buy material and a wand where we learn that the wand chooses the wizard and harry was chosen by the sorcerer's wand that killed his parents and tried to kill him but he failed and no one saw him again. That's why harry is famous in the wizarding world, because he escaped one of the greatest dark sorcerers of all time and survived with only that ray-shaped scar on his forehead. That man was Voldmort but everyone was afraid to say his name and only called him you know who or the one that shall not be named.<br/><br/>When he goes to try on the robes he meets his future nemesis. A blond good looking boy with pure blood family that was not very nice. Next they go to the Gringotts bank and Harry discovers that he is rich and his parents left him a huge fortune. They also went to another vault, where Hagrid, the little giant, had to fetch a special package at the request of Dumbledore, who according to Hagrid was the greatest sorcerer who had ever existed and was also the director of the school of magic. Hagrid also comments that only a fool would assault the bank, as it was very safe.<br/><br/>Hagrid leaves Harry at Kings Cross station alone and tells him to take the 9 3/4 platform. Harry does not find this platform, but notices a large family running against a pillar and disappears through it. The mother of the family understands the boy's confusion and helps him. Harry runs against the pillar and quickly crosses to the other side, where he arrives at a new station, where there was red train ready to take him to school. He packs his luggage and goes inside, where he sits in an empty compartment. Shortly afterwards, the youngest boy of the family who has helped him arrives and asks to sit there while Harry nods. His name was Ron Weasley. And as his family he was a red head. Harry also buys all the candy of the candy lady and share wiith his new friend."

","""Harry Potter and Sorcer's Stone"" is a adventure, family and fantasy movie directed by Chris Columbus and was produced in 2001 in the USA. It is 2h 32min long. The most important characters are Harry, Ron and Hermine starred by the actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. The film tells the story about the 11 years old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) how find out he's a wizard. In Hogwarts the magic school he leans more about his past and fight with his friends Hermine Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) aganst the evil.
I like to interesting story and the world of wizards and witches but I didn't like many characteristics of the many characters."

"jshoesmithkr","9","1","1","9 November 2017"," Great and funny
","After watching the this, I knew that I must watch the sequels and read the books. This film starts off with some funny bits were the Dursleys are yelling at Harry when really it is Dudley being the misbehaved one. Let's remember that this film is set in the 1990s,not the 21st century and yet Dudley still manages to get all sorts of interesting presents. The arrival of Hagrid instantly made you like him. He's my favourite Harry Potter character because he's clumsy and dangerous, a bit like me. <br/><br/>Hermione was attractive and Draco Malfoy as the bully seemed like a good plot to use throughout both this film and the others. (People do wear socks in bed just to say so please don't make that sound non existent.) The book was just as good as the film and to be fair, there are some things that don't work as well when it's in the book.<br/><br/>The troll scene was a bit gross so I'm glad it ended very quickly, if you ask me, Hermione should not have lied about what happened, she was the victim when she knew nothing. <br/><br/>The mystery of who the main villain was very interesting because it made me wonder whether it was Hagrid or Snape. The fact that it was Professor Quirrel was a plot twist to remember. Never trust wizards that wear purple turbines on their heads, they are not to be trusted. <br/><br/>7.5 is an average rating from viewers but just remember one thing, Harry Potter will always be more successful than DC, even if the characters vary."
"Rickting","6","1","1","5 August 2014"," A magic filled but unimaginative adaptation
","I love the Harry Potter books because of their brilliant writing, exciting and funny moments, compelling characters and the way that I'm hooked as soon as I pick one up. They deserved to be such a phenomenon. The films? Not so much. This starts off the adaptations in OK style, and follows Harry Potter's attempts to stop the evil sorcerer who killed his parents getting a stone which will help him return to power.<br/><br/>This, along with the second is directed by Christopher Columbus and the first 2 often seem to be seen as the weakest. In my opinion these 2 aren't the worst, but they're certainly not that great. For some reason, Columbus decides to copy the book page for page but leave out most of its depth, wit and bite. For a Harry Potter fan this may be satisfying, but since the film is also overly syrupy and kid friendly, adults may be irritated by it. This adaptation is a mixed bag overall.<br/><br/>The adult cast has more talented British actors than you can shake a stick at and while most of them have relatively small roles, they certainly leave an impression. John Williams' as usual provides a great soundtrack which sadly was used less in later films and while I'm not desperately keen on Chris Columbus' style, he does do a perfectly OK job at directing the film. To a newcomer and someone who hasn't read the book the film would likely seem magical and fascinating as it thankfully includes many details about the HP universe, which is one of the best fictional universes ever created.<br/><br/>There are some genuinely frightening moments and it provides good escapism. But there are many problems. It's nowhere near as funny or fascinating as the book, which is odd as it's pretty much as carbon copy of the book although to be fair it omits the right parts of the book. It's also overlong and frequently dull, and things such as the troll, the dragon and the mirror are conveyed poorly to the big screen, although the finale is still good. The child actors are excruciating to watch at times, although they would improve in later films.<br/><br/>Overall a wooden and unimaginative adaptation which is cinematically uninteresting and, on my last viewing, a bore to watch. This is the 6th best, and while I used to like it, now I can see it's routine, though competently executed and visually decent, adaptation with little personality. When having to deal with the wooden child actors it's even more irritating."
"faithpersecuted33","5","1","1","4 December 2013"," Decent film
","As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, ""Adventures in Babysitting""), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.<br/><br/>I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses."

","It seems that some that had the fortune to read the Harry Potter books before seeing the movie (I am not one of them), did not like the movie much even though they kept to the book very well.<br/><br/>I loved the movie, and was very happy that they introduced the characters in the first of a possible 7 movie series (Chris Columbus mentioned 7 movies on the Sorcerer's Stone extras).  With that many coming out, why not introduce the characters in the first movie.<br/><br/>I read the book after seeing the movie and saw that they not only stuck to the book, they put in most of the parts I liked (except the color flames at the end).<br/><br/>I enjoyed the second movie (chamber of Secrets) even more, yet I have not read the book.  And look forward to the rest of the books to come to life.<br/><br/>
I for one and am sure many others that feel the same way, it is nice to see the Harry Potter books come to life, and the Actors that were chosen to play the characters were perfect.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus is a great Director/Producer.

"lambiepie-2","10","1","1","28 November 2002"," A Very Nice Effort
","Okay, I never read the Harry Potter Books. I couldn't have cared less, but I have nieces and nephews and other children in my life who are from ages 7 to 12 who have. What I had to do was remember what it was like when I was that age, so long ago, and what ""new"" movies I had to entertain myself with.<br/><br/>
So...I had ""Oliver!"", ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Chitty, Chitty, Bang! Bang!"". Other than those, it was ""R"" rated films that I was more interested in.  Why? For that is what interested me via what Hollywood made available. I was ""too old"" for those cutie Disney Animated cartoons of that time, and too young for the adult theme films that were being advertised which I DID want to see. This is why I like this film, it brings back the genre for children, the wonder, the fantasy in film just for them.<br/><br/>A nice effort production wise, with the casting, with the story. Children love fantasy, wonder, adventure, a character THEIR age doing and thinking like THEY would and...watching kids eat lots of ""sweets"". This Harry Potter film fit the bill. <br/><br/>For me as an adult, it was...nice. For children between 7 and 12, its fantastic. The special effects were neat, the story was engaging for them, but what I liked the best was the school itself. I thought that the classes and interactions of the children with each other were on their level. So it was at a Wizards school. Point is, it could be at ANY school. (or boarding school!)<br/><br/>In my surroundings, there have been a few adults/parents screaming about how this film and the school ""Hogwarts"" promotes kids to get into the black arts. I think that is so awful to think that, and I think it does not give children the benefit of the doubt. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a nice little film about something a child/pre-teen has fun with. I actually compared it to the Disney film ""Fantasia"" and the scene of Mickey being the ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"". I watched that over and over as a 6 year old and trust me, I had no desire to get into ""the black arts"".<br/><br/>To me, this film is geared towards that audience that has been forgotten AND portrayed in the last 15 years, the 7 to 12 year olds. Yes, Disney had alot of animation that was marketed to that group of children, but its been quite sometime to make a long full length feature film of fantasy where children are the focus, and they are just...children. Reminds me of ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang""...fantasy films for the 7 to 12 year old to enjoy the movie going experience on their level, but NOT talking DOWN to them.<br/><br/>Children under 7 may be a bit scared at some parts and teens over 13 may not get into this film at all. But for the 7 to 12 year olds, this film is a nice one for them in the same vein as ""Oliver!"" and ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" was for me."

"Huttson","Null","1","1","10 November 2001"," Three things wrong with the film . . .
","There are three things wrong with this film: it's not reality; it's not a book; and it's not bad.<br/><br/>With the weight of expectation on Chris Colombus and Daniel Radcliffe's shoulders, everyone seems to have forgotten that this is a film, and NOT a book. Even though it's two and a half hours long, there was never any way in which it could be a completely faithful adaptation of the book. Characters who are lightly sketched in the book had to be sacrificed to ensure that the story worked. And ultimately, that was what had to happen on screen, that the story flowed for both fans of the book and also cinema-goers who would have no idea of what Harry Potter was all about. The loss of the Dursleys' opening scenes will most likely be rectified by later films, since they appear as bookend characters. Poppy Pomfrey, Peeves, Polkiss, the mention of Mrs Figg, the rest of the Potter family in the Mirror of Erised: all of these omissions are reasonable in light of this film introducing a series of stories.<br/><br/>The first twenty minutes are, I think, the true test of the audience. For those who've read the books, it probably takes too long to get to the story proper, leaving out all the active, conflict-filled moments, such as Harry's first encounter with Malfoy and his cronies, most of Harry's life with the Dursleys, and the set-up of Neville's forgetful nature. For someone coming to it cold, it probably whips by too quickly, leaving too much said by characters rather than dramatised by action; remember that actions speak louder than words, and never more so than in the movies.<br/><br/>Once in the second act, however, the story reaches its tone quite quickly, and there are moments of sheer brilliance, including the entry into the Great Hall, Harry's first broomstick flight, the Quidditch match, the Invisibility Cloak, the emotional tone of the Mirror of Erised, and every single thing about the Dark [Forbidden] Forest.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe plays the cipher of Harry Potter to perfection. He's never completely certain about his actions unless it's for the sake of his friends or the memory of his family. He's an Everyman, whose greatest characteristic is loyalty. The only problems he has are during the first act, which is a difficult part of the film anyway. From the entry to Hogwarts onwards, however, he's a joy to watch: his delight in his friendships, in being recognised for his strengths, the emotional rollercoaster he endures during the Mirror of Erised sequence, you can see exactly why Chris Colombus held out for Dan's casting. I think if anyone has a problem with Dan's performance, it's because he's not a broad, visual actor, but one where everything is a slight shade of subtlety. Similarly, Harry is not a broad comic character like Ron, nor an over-achiever like Hermione; he's the rock against their wind and water.<br/><br/>Rupert Grint is just brilliant, with the timing of a comic genius, the rubber-faced contortions of a master, and the emotional range of actors many years his senior. We can expect great things from Mr Grint.<br/><br/>Emma Watson in her first screen role is the supporting lady that Harry Potter needs. I believed every moment she came out with the right information, I believed that she had feelings to be hurt, and I believe that she has so much more in her to come. I hope we get to see all that this riveting young actress is capable of.<br/><br/>Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid makes him not only menacing at need, but also loveable beneath that hair. I'm sure that many actors would have felt overwhelmed by the costume, the make-up and the prosthetics, but Robbie inhabits the part. Jo was right to have him in mind. I can't wait to see him with Cher as Madame Maxime.<br/><br/>Before I saw the film, I never thought that there would be any other actors who would stand out in such a cast of great youngsters and well-established names, but Sean Biggerstaffe as Oliver Wood and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy are two stars in the making. Sean's Oliver is strong, visionary and above all, funny, and I foresee great things for him. Tom Felton brings Draco to life, much more so than Harry Melling as Dudley, making Draco sly and superior, but also vulnerable and comic, and I can't wait to see more of his turn as Harry's school nemesis.<br/><br/>Richard Harris, Dame Maggie Smith and Zoe Wanamaker's characters are somewhat backgrounded by the antics of their students, but then the film IS called Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone, so it can only be expected. They provide a great mix of adult role models, and a strong backbone for the human side of Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Of course, any film of Harry Potter would be nothing without the witchcraft and wizardy. As a filmgoer, I never expected to see reality, since magic doesn't yet exist in our world, so how would we know what it looks like? To complain that the CGI was below par is amazing. The Burmese Python was fantastic, its motion absolutely believable. The Quidditch match and Harry's later solo pursuit of the winged key are literally breathtaking, and I felt my heart beating harder when Harry caught the Snitch. If CGI wasn't working there, I don't know when it was. I could go on, but I will just add that the Invisibility Cloak, from both outside and inside, was just inspired, and much better than I would have thought possible.<br/><br/>Diagon Alley was amazing. To those detractors of the scenic design, just look at Mr Ollivander's shop: how many wand boxes can you see? And, do you think they were built on mainframes?<br/><br/>There is so much more I could, and will say, but I'll stop here. Just enjoy it. It's a dream of a ride."

","This was a rather interesting experience. Take a bunch of kids who can't act, add some truly horrendous special effects, add some of the largest plot holes seen in a movie and you have a simply unwatchable pile of garbage. The movies definitely get better but the first two simply should not have been made. To show that I'm not merely spouting steam I'd just like to point out the largest of said plot holes. It is a rather important point to the story that Snape helped protect the stone. It is basically all that is talked about by Hagrid yet, somehow, the director forgot to put Snape's protection of the stone into the movie. It really is too bad that this turned out to be bad enough that I have a hard time calling it a movie."

","Harry Potter seems to highlight what today's society is missing; the age of magical innocence, the pure abandonment of that essence of childhood. In this day and age of computer games and quick fix takeaway electronic happiness and incessant CGI violence, it's brilliant to see the world excited by story telling and the simple things. It reminds me of years ago as a child reading volumes of Roald Dahl's compositions and hanging out to read the next chapter of 'Danny the Champion of the World'. Harry Potter has engaged the world back into that innocence, even if it is for a two hour movie.<br/><br/>The Philosopher's Stone is majestic, bold and outrageously expansive... and I want more. I took my son to a packed cinema and we were both entranced with the.. well.. magic of the package. The awesome Harry Potter theme and musical score, meeting of the main characters, hunting for school items, the train ride, the first look of Hogwarts... It is all magical. The casting of adults are perfect. Richard Harris typifies what a respected all powerful all knowing headmaster should encompass, all the professors are brilliant and Snape could be played by no one else except Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>The 'magic' of the surroundings, the little gadgets and seemingly insignificant details are lovely. To be honest, the whole production smacks of that professional quality that is European/British and it was refreshing to be free from the American drawl and plentiful explosions and swearing.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this is a child's movie. But one that transcends through time and makes a cynical crestfallen adult smile and feel like a child again. Sure you have to ignore the sometime sugary scenes and I just looked at my son's beaming face... Harry Potter works."

","The film focuses heavily on Potter's methods of survival and his noticeably deteriorating psyche. When he is not preoccupied with seeking basic necessities, Potter works in his basement lab attempting to develop his magical skills. Radcliff does a superb job of portraying Harry Potter's solitary character, who everyday is searching for solutions to the problems in his future as well as the future of mankind. Radcliffe's acting is the highlight of the film and is really the driving force that could have actually made this film legendary.<br/><br/>Now for the bad stuff.<br/><br/>This Harry Poter is severely hindered by its sub-par screenplay. The first 1/3 to 1/2 of the film is a joy to watch, but suddenly holes and diversions become extremely visible.<br/><br/>The climax of the film is very rushed and the ending was typical clichéd nonsense. Pointless philosophical overtones and dialogue are added to try and create a moral- based story, but just turn into fodder that is annoying to have to listen to. Finally, the special effects look more like sci-fi monsters than actual mutated and deranged beings and are not present nearly enough until the end of the film."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","6","3","6","23 December 2006"," It's 'Philosopher's Stone'!
","I'm not really a big fan of the HP films. I don't think that they translate well from the books as they are often quite long and need severe cutting down in order to fit into a 2 hour+ film. This has been increasingly evident in the later HP sequels, but Philosopher's Stone seems to be pretty much all intact.<br/><br/>I do find Chris Columbus' mostly naturalized approach to shooting the film to be the most appropriate. In GOF, Mike Newell had the cheap and uncheerful logic of shooting everything with a heavy green filter to make it look 'mysterious' and 'magical'. I think it just looks stupid and that the far-fetched fantasy nature is more identifiable if shot more ordinarily.<br/><br/>What does bug me about this film and always surprises me on repeat viewings, is how horrible the entire kiddie cast are at acting. Check out the terrible performance from the guy who plays the blandly named Oliver Wood! Woof! It's like watching some rubbish Primary School play with big budget visual effects. It takes me out of the movie every time.<br/><br/>The 150-minute running time seems to pass by in a breeze, something I've never really felt with the sequels. But something that bugs me is even right here at the beginning Dumbledore seems to be like 'I'll tell you about it when you're older, Harry.' Which is a cheap hook to make us read/watch the later installments. <br/><br/>I don't really have that much to say about Philosopher's Stone, which is why my review is short and spiceless. It's a shame the sequels had to be so boring. Stick with the books, a couple are overwritten but they are superior to the films. A clichéd thing to say, but still true."

Emma Watson is the only half decent child actor here, yet compared to other child stars (Dakota Fanning, anyone?)she is rubbish. You actually see the 'trio' mouthing each other's lines along with each other. Heheh, quite funny really!

This film is an absolute mess! Too many things are missed out. Fair enough, he's got to turn a whole book into a movie, which is hard. He completely changed some things! Like, for example, Harry and Hermione have detention in the forest because they are caught coming down from the tower after getting rid of Norbert (Ron isnt there). Malfoy and Neville also are caught out of bed and thats why they end up in the forest. Ron was not involved. He also took out important stuff from the book and STILL reffered to it later on in the film! He didnt really explain the Philospher's Stone enough either. <br/><br/>This is a very poor adaptation for a poor director who let too much influence from Hollywood spoil what could have been a really 'magical' film.

Then it hit me: it's the story of a no talent underdog who overcomes great obstacles with a little help from his friends. And who doesn't like that?<br/><br/> Overall, I'd say this is above average. I thought the three kids, Radcliffe (Harry), Grint (Ron), and Watson (Hermione), gave capable performances, oh, as did Felton, who played Draco. Also worthy of mention are Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane.

","What's wrong with this film? Children, magic, and tone.<br/><br/>1. Children. Any film that has children in it is in big trouble. Children on screen tend to be irritating, and this film is no exception.<br/><br/>2. Magic. Magic alone is a problem, because magic is essentially deus ex machina. And there is nothing more destructive for a film than deus ex machina. People hate that. If they all use magic, and magic can do anything, then what is the point? How can you even get involved in a scene when you cannot anticipate anything, other than the fact that the hero will eventually come up with some spell to get him out of the jam? Moreover, the film is so obsessed with the magical, that magic becomes tedious. If every room and every object is enchanted, then the whole magic is gone. If everything is magical, nothing is magical. Thus the overuse of magic works against the film.<br/><br/>3. The tone. The film starts as a children's adventure, but then introduces inappropriately sinister elements. This is particularly clear in the sequels, and there is a clear progression with each sequel. This is a huge weakness, because a film should never waver on the tone. You cannot expect the audience to shift from a children's film to a dark monster film. Is it for children, or is it for older audiences? The children will be scared by the monsters, the older audiences will be put off by the childishness. I absolutely hate he tonal mess that persists throughout the films.<br/><br/>Final verdict: I would avoid this franchise."

But what's worst about the film is the fact that it has attracted so many adults. You know something is wrong with the world when adults are discussing quittich instead of any number of slightly intelligent topics. Still it is a children's film, not a work of art and at the end of the day the kids will be rushing in a mindless throng to see the next film.

After everyone else in my family had read it, I decided to give it a go because I had little better to do at the time. I wound up throwing the book across the room in around thirty pages, feeling that not only had my intelligence been insulted, so too had the already-persecuted-enough faiths of Wicca and its pagan relatives.<br/><br/>So when I was given the chance to see this film for free, as long as I delivered my considered opinion to the local distributor when it was all over, I knew I should have let someone else take the assignment. But I just couldn't let fate smack me in the face once without giving it a chance to even out the marks. I basically had a similar reaction to the film that I did to the book: I walked out on it in about thirty minutes. As for what I told the local distributor, it runs something along the lines of missing the book's feeble, so-obvious-it-will-make-you-shake-your-head-in-despair attempts at satire and not being all that well-acted to boot. It is nothing more than a 152-minute commercial for a bunch of merchandise that is basically useless and prone to falling apart, but it does have Harry's visage on it.<br/><br/>Since this film has been released in Australia, there has been constant comparisons between it and the upcoming Lord Of The Rings adaptations. There is no comparison for the following reasons: LOTR treats its audiences with respect, LOTR treats the faiths, cultures, and peoples it takes a lot of its details from with respect, and LOTR is not aimed at the lowest possible common denominator. Now that I have that out of the way, I'll just sit back and bask in my superiority to HP fans until the local distributor gets around to releasing LOTR this boxing day. :P"

","Back when I started reading the Harry Potter books I thought they would just be pulp fiction type, churned out novels with no real substance, but I actually quite enjoyed them, so when the movies came out I was worried.<br/><br/>Would they hold up to the first book? Would it be true to the book and would the casting be right? Would the stories have the same appropriate feel?<br/><br/>They did great across the board. An excellent cast of young people who grew into their roles as well and who did great jobs throughout the series.<br/><br/>Great writing that stayed true to the stories, doing justice to the author's vision while creating a visually captivating movie going experience.<br/><br/>Wonderful direction and mood. Great cinematography. Fun movie for all ages!"

","My sister and I, back when I was ten, wouldn't even go near anything Harry Potter-related, despite its immense popularity at the time; we'd call Harry Potter ""Hairy Pothead"" and laugh at the nerdy glasses he wore on the book and DVD covers. Anyway, recently we decided it was time to see what made Harry Potter fans so raving mad over a little boy with superpowers and a geeky school uniform, and it was a nerdy children's movie but not nearly as bad as we thought! The main character, Harry, is a seemingly average boy living in the U.K. with his aunt, uncle, and spoiled overweight cousin, Dudley (great name choice). When Harry begins discovering strange powers in himself, his aunt and uncle do everything in THEIR power to keep the truth a secret from him, but when Harry finds out he's a wizard and is given an invite to a secluded boarding school for wizards and witches, he eagerly accepts, wanting to be with kids like himself. From there he picks up two misfit friends, meets a snotty rival with way too much gel in his bleached hair, and meets a variety of teachers, including a perverse, hawk-like old guy with emo hair and a hooked nose.<br/><br/>So, one thing I noticed is that throughout the eight HP movies, the series quickly changes from a children's movie to a series with a more adult theme, and characters become far more complex than they were likely ever intended to be by the book author. I did enjoy the Harry Potter movies, though the acting wasn't the best, the soundtrack was pretty good, the scenery was fantastic and I liked seeing some of the strange and wonderful creatures made up by the author, man, that lady has serious imagination! Still, Harry Potter certainly doesn't beat The X-Files or Cold Case."
"sglrml","3","2","4","29 June 2010"," Overrated nonsense
","I just don't understand... I CANNOT understand... what is the fuss about? Why in heaven's name did this film receive so much praise? I think that it's scarcely more than a blown-up, clap-bang-whizz production with virtually no intent on telling the story properly as making it look like some mega-fantastic phenomenon of some kind; a chance for the producers to dangle their treasures, their ultimately priceless possessions in the faces of the viewers so that you can't miss the action whatever the situation is. Why else would the likes of certain actors be present in roles that clearly don't suit them (or else they don't suit the roles) as well as they might have done for members of the acting profession who don't specially have notable reputations and acclaim to support their good names (okay, maybe they were of the right SORT to have played the characters, yet in regard to the way they were presented in the books I perceived a lack of performance and instead more of the ""natural"" style of acting; somehow that ruined it for me).<br/><br/>None of it seems as close to the book as could have been thought, and having seen a few drama adaptations in my time, I should know. In some way if there was little room for some things to be added, I'd put that down to the sadly developed habit of the film's producers'/directors' adding these little, unnecessary moments of (what are meant to be) eye-popping freakish occurrences with the intent of making you sit up in your seat (if that's really anything to do with the action or the fact it's shown in such a epic way).<br/><br/>While the film may have some things that don't rely greatly on lavishness or known names (not that that's exactly bad on some occasions) I can't see that there was ever much reason for making this film from the beginning, except to turn the story of Harry Potter into a complete spectacle (sorry for sounding blunt yet that's how it goes) with the end result like an attempt to force the audience into being astonished.<br/><br/>It's no concern of mine if the film's remembered or forgotten, but I know one thing for sure; anyone keen to see how stories evolve when transferred from the book to the big screen, this is a good example about getting ""carried away."""

","Not being a reader of the Harry Potter books, I came to the first Harry Potter movie with a totally open mind. There seems to be those who love the book but hate the film; those that love both; and even a few who hate both! Having watched Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone, I must confess that I'm not entirely sure what all the fuss is about. This strikes me as solid but unremarkable, totally overlong but fairly diverting fare.<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is left as a baby at the house of his relatives, the Dursleys. Later we learn that his parents were magicians killed by a dark sorcerer, and he has been hidden away for his own protection until he is older. Eventually the time comes for Harry to discover his destiny. He is tracked down by the friendly giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and sent to Hogwarts, a special school of Witchcraft and Wizardry for youngsters with magical prowess. Everyone at Hogwarts, the fellow pupils and the teachers – seems to know about Harry's past, even though he himself knows barely any of it. Harry befriends two other first year students – Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) – and begins to learn the art of wizardry from various eccentric teachers. Things take a darker turn when the three young magicians begin to suspect that Voldemort, an evil figure from Harry's past, is trying to regain his once-great power and strength by obtaining the Philosopher's Stone, a powerful object hidden somewhere at the school.<br/><br/>The film is not particularly well-acted, with the child stars coming across as if they are carrying out a reading rehearsal, and too many star names (Julie Walters, John Hurt, John Cleese, Zoe Wanamaker) hamming it up like mad in cameo roles. At least the main adult roles – taken by the likes of Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Richard Harris – are played with a degree of experience and finesse. There are some splendid visuals in parts, though the effects are not so impressive during the much-hyped Quidditch sequence. The most disappointing thing for me is the long and laborious build-up, which leads to a somewhat flat final confrontation (I am reliably informed by those in the know that this film's climax is intentionally brief and aborted, and links to developments in the later films). Overall, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a reasonable watch, but I'm hoping for something more as the series progresses."
"raptorclaw","5","2","4","23 July 2009"," The first 'Harry Potter' makes no mistakes - and takes no chances, and has no style
","My summary might be a little harsh on what is, after all, a highly entertaining children's movie that's grossed hundreds of millions of dollars and, undoubtedly, still delights children that didn't exist in 2001 through DVD and Blu-Ray. But I stand by my statement - I liked it when I was 9, and I liked it last night, but 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is paralyzed by its fear of alarming any part of its audience.<br/><br/>The chief difference between this and later Potter films is in its tone. This movie replicates the dreaminess and whimsicality of the book, faithfully recreating even incidental magical scenery from the novel with painstaking care - however, it doesn't add any of its own. That, in microcosm, is the one thing wrong with the entire 146 minutes of film: the plot unfolds identically to the book's, the dialog is often taken verbatim from it, the world is designed as the most neutral and safe - SAFE, is the problem - version of the Potter universe one can imagine, and the overall effect is that of an illustrated audiobook. Director Chris Columbus takes absolutely no risks, a decision which only seems more foolish as the years go by and newer Potter films, like Alfonso Cuaron's excellent 'Prisoner of Azkaban', burst with imagination and creativity. While, like 'Star Wars' (but less so), 'Stone' does evoke a sense of wonder at the magical things in Harry's world (and, in case anyone misses the point, the movie's child actors exchange chuffed grins for about a third of the running time), the anxious restraint with which the whole deal is executed renders it rather leaden.<br/><br/>Hence the comment about paralysis I started off with. It may be well made, but 'Stone' is - tragically, as it turns out, considering the quality of all the movie's other ingredients - uninspired. But it is rescued from a boring fate by the fact that it is, after all, telling a cracking good yarn. One that I (heretically) think is actually better for film than for a book, where the flimsiness of its plotting and lack of true literary spark makes it come off as a kind of Roald Dahl Lite. Add to this a stable of magnificent British actors who gleefully shed their layers of reverend good service in classics on stage and screen and dive totally into their spectacularly silly roles. The roll-call is phenomenal: Sir Richard Harris, Dame Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt and others in smaller parts that pull them off with panache calculated to shade any flaws in the performances of the younger actors - who, by the way, are really quite good. They don't need to be brilliant, and they're good enough here as 11-year-old kids. Which is what they are.<br/><br/>The story, anyone should know. Harry Potter is an orphan whose parents die in mysterious circumstances and who, at the age of 11, after a decade of living miserably with a cruel aunt and uncle, discovers that he is a wizard. He goes off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he finds that he is not only a wizard, but a famous wizard: the only one ever to survive an attack by the now-vanquished Dark Lord, You-Know-Who. Dark Things are stirring at Hogwarts - there is a whisper in the Forbidden Forest, a teacher with suspicious designs, and something horrible lies under the trap door in the left third floor corridor . . . and above it.<br/><br/>I quite enjoyed it actually. Shame it had to be so stuffy. Recommended."
"sweetlittlepie","7","2","4","25 April 2009"," One of my favorites
","Okay I'm gonna say this honestly, I absolutely love this movie. Take in mind that I've read the novels, I'm a big fan and I watched this movie for the first time when I was 10. This is a good adaptation of a great book, but I will say that the only thing that disappoints me now when I watch it is that I can't help, but imagine what it would have been like if JK's first choice of director had been picked (Terry Gilliam). Terry would have definitely been more creative and he probably would have brought something different to the table. I agree with British film critic Mark Kermode, Columbus does have a rather ""bland and straight-forward"" direction style. Now that may work in some movies, but not in a fantasy film like Harry Potter. I must say though in his defense that second movie was much better than the first one, and it seemed to be an improvement for Chris who was probably a lot more comfortable with his surroundings, and had a better relationship with the actors. Still both films are a bit bland in comparison to the rest of the franchise, most of all if we were to compare the first two, to the third one which was directed by the wonderful Alfonso Cuarón, who's style of direction is considerably different from Columbus'. Apart from the blandness the film is great fun for the whole family, and there's always a distinctive energy when you're watching a new HP flick in theaters with a bunch of enthusiastic fans. People are saying now that Twilight is going to replace HP, but I don't think so. The Twilight fan base is only a third of the HP fan base, and the film series is close to been the biggest franchise of all time, and I think they can actually accomplish that. There's great acting by everyone, most of all by the Golden Trio, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and the lovely Emma Watson. Also stand out performances by Maggie Smith as the strict but fair Professor McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as the ""greasy git"", also known as Professor Snape. Richard Harris excels as the Headmaster of Hogwarts Academy, Dumbledore. He plays Harry's mentor to a tee. And I have to say I sorely miss him even if Gambon is doing a great job as his replacement. I just wish Richard would have lived far enough to finish the film series, but I guess you can't get everything you wish for."

Don't believe the hype about Harry Potter as it is little more than a large cash cow that the studio execs signed up to drain as many children (and their parents) as possible of their cash.<br/><br/>The story is atrociously bad, the acting not much better and the special effects pretty bad. The whole plot is utterly ridiculous and packaged together in a film so dreadfully written that it should never have made it into print let alone onto celluloid.<br/><br/>It is extremely rare that a film, even a really bad unwatchable one makes me want to switch off before the end but I had to turn over after just ten minutes as I could not stand this utter codswallop any longer.<br/><br/>And yet the popularity of this series seems never ending as sad people dress up their kids in badly imitated costumes from the films so they can queue up outside bookshops in the middle of the night to purchase the latest instalment.

"tahirjon6","2","2","4","27 August 2005"," Horrifically Bad Adaptation.
","This film was just plain poorly made, there is no trying to deny that. It was based on a 300 page (fairly easy to adapt) world record breaking novel that in the opinion of many is one of the best books ever written. When it was announced that director Chris Columbus would helm the project, many moaned and groaned, his previous works have lacked in... erm... entertainment. Steve Kloves was assigned to adapt, Kloves is not as seasoned a man as several other talented screenwriters. So we now have a mediocre director and screenwriter assigned to one of the potentially greatest films of all time. It was expected that the actors who would eventually play the trio would have to be 'green' (unexperienced) because veteran child actors are often not right for franchise roles. So a new ensemble, a poor director, and a mediocre screenwriter. But it could still have come out good right?... WRONG! Chris Columbus' direction was absolutely appalling! His incoherent transitions, unchanging camera angles, lack of any use of dolly shots, over-use of tracking shots, monotonous lighting, and complete ignorance to inform his actors how to actually act, immediately contributed to the collapse of this picture. Kloves' writing didn't contribute any quality to the abysmal film either. The novel was an epic: written as an epic, described as an epic, and sold as an epic. So why was the script written like a quirky independent film? Furthermore the CGI in this film (despite Columbus' excuses of time restrictions) INEXCUSABLE! You do not have ghosts float in 2D patterns as though designed on Apple iMovie when you have a budget exceeds 100 Million dollars! Now: The Ensemble. Too many reviews have been published tearing apart the acting of the three actors portraying the most well known characters in history. So I won't... JUST KIDDING! The acting was and remains now, encased in DVD releases, some of the worst in cinema history. ""You mean? That thing was Voldemort?"" was meant to be spoken in a spine-chilling and dragged-out way that made the audience cringe in terrifying realization, and was instead spoken as though Harry Potter had stumbled upon a surprise party. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson deliver some of the MOST irritatingly bad lines ever spoken, it's rather easy to simply learn to not over-act, to not under-act, to just act! Espesially in a role so perfectly described in books. Rupert Grint was tolerable. The movie was an enormous insult to the well-written book of the same name and despite the hype surrounding the apparent attraction ten year old girls have to Daniel Radcliffe (whose normal weight does not fit the skinny persona described in the book) and the ""amazing"" (gag) special effect, most critics and fans alike cannot bare to even watch the film a first or for those unfortunate ones like myself a second time. I only wonder if, somehow seeing how bad the movie adaptation would be, J.K. Rowling would have instead named the Centaur Firenze: Torgo."
"Soyokaze","2","2","4","6 August 2005"," If you want to enjoy 'the Philosopher's stone', read the book.
","This movie was clearly an attempt at making a quick grab for the Christmas buck when it was released. I don't know if this movie was severely butchered on the editing table, or if it was just plain badly directed. It rushes through the story at break-neck speed, jumping from scene to scene without any obvious connection between them (perhaps a narrator could have solved this), resulting in a confused jumble of dialogue and action. After seeing this film, I was SO glad that I had read the book, otherwise I probably would have been wondering what the heck was going on for most of it. This movie is what you get when you try to squeeze the contents of an entire novel into a single film, and then continue to cut it down to fit the attention-span of an eight year old. Recommended only if you're under the age of 10, or are extremely familiar with the book."

"Elswet","7","2","4","22 September 2003"," I like it very much, but there are good reasons why I can't love it
","There were many plot changes to accommodate the adaptation of this literary work to film. But what bothered me more were the obvious comparisons to the 1986 TV movie ""The Worst Witch,"" in which many of the main characters of this work seem to have appeared. <br/><br/>Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall are obviously different sides/aspects of Diana Rigg's Hardbroom. Professor Dumbledore, an obvious male version of Miss Cackle. Harry is Mildred, and Ronald Weasley is Maud. <br/><br/>Furthermore, Draco Malfoy can be found in the Worst Witch, in the form of Ethel Hallow. Hardbroom gives Mildred nothing but a hard time in potions class, Miss Spellbinder (Madam Hooch to the HP fans) is trying to teach the first years how to fly, and they're all getting ready for a visit from Tim Curry's Grand Wizard (the HP's Minister of Magic). And, while this group of young witches plays ""terror tag"" rather than Quittich, and it is an all girl school instead of going co-ed, the obvious comparisons are still staggering.<br/><br/>But ah, well. No one has sued, so what are we to do?<br/><br/>Harry Potter is a young survivor of a dark crusade to silence those in opposition to an ancient evil. As a baby in his crib, he was spared by the Grace of his mother's love. Although of ""Wizarding"" blood, the attack on young Harry has left him with certain gifts and abilities he otherwise would not have had. As puberty strikes, so does Hogwarts in the guise of multiple invitations to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/><br/>Harry's subsequent shopping trip to Diagon Alley is very entertaining, and rich with detail to which you otherwise would not be privy, concerning the back-story and succeeds in accomplishing character depth and setting the mood for the rest of the story.<br/><br/>The direction by Chris Columbus is creatively wonderful. The cinematography is outstanding as great attention has been paid to detail. Details, no matter how small or inconsequential, enrich any creative work, regardless of the medium. I just hate the fact that Columbus (as Exec. Producer of this and subsequent HP films) could not find the time to read ahead through the second book to determine that there was a pumpkin patch, rocky crags, and a second room on Hagrid's hut! How much more beautiful would the PoA have been without having to stomach the sudden changes to accommodate the ""TRUE"" layout of Hogwarts grounds?!) <br/><br/>The train ride to Hogwarts introduces the main supporting characters; Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson).<br/><br/>As the ""first years"" (new students) arrive by boat to Hogwarts Castle, the look of wonder on all their faces is absolutely believable. When I first saw this production, I was a bit full of wonder myself. Hogwarts is beautifully done, every little component of architecture and design was perpetrated with an intense caring, and great eye for detail. <br/><br/>The acting by these young thespians is honest and genuine; truly professional performances by all involved. Let me also add here that the casting was top row. They got just the right people for just the right parts. In my opinion, there was not a single character that was mis-cast. (I absolutely detest Tom Felton's character, Draco Malfoy...his acting is brilliant, to elicit such a gut reaction towards his character.) <br/><br/>Maggie Smith is a joy as the hard-lined Professor McGonagall. I've always loved watching her demonstrate her talents, and her performance in this production was no exception. Her character is like a roasted marshmallow...hard and tough on the outside, but with a heart that can be soft and sweet on the inside. Her treatment of young Harry demonstrates the love her character felt for his parents, now deceased; murdered in the dark crusade waged by Voldemort, one of the darkest wizards ever produced by the House of Slytherin (one of the four Houses at Hogwarts), and his many followers. <br/><br/>Emma Watson positively shines as Hermione Granger. Her performance is quite believable and lends so MUCH to the movie. Her character was one of my favorites from the book, and her personification lives up to my every expectation. She plays the well-(self-) educated neophyte Witchling VERY well. I cannot wait to see where life leads her in the future. <br/><br/>Robbie Coltrain's character; however, was my favorite among the teachers. Rubius Hagrid, who says repeatedly, ""I shouldn't have said that,"" has a heart of pure gold, and the demeanor of a true gentle giant. No one could've portrayed Hagrid, like Robbie Coltrain. <br/><br/>The scenery and mountain footage shot and shown in abundance is absolutely breath-taking, the direction giving this effort the professional quality for which I had hoped it would possess. The effects were stunningly clever and extremely well perpetrated, brilliantly demonstrating Rowling's extraordinary imagination and creativity, and perpetuating the magic of her original literary work. I was pleased with this movie; though not as pleased as I was in reading the book.<br/><br/>Jim Henson's Creature Shop did a marvelous job with the ""monsters"" in this movie. Better than I would have expected from Brian (Jim's son) when you compare his ""Muppets From Space"" to the earlier Muppet films done by his dad. Impressive work on Fluffy and Norbert, Brian. Jolly good show! <br/><br/>""There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it."" Voldemort. <br/><br/>The ending is both satisfying and heartwarming. I truly enjoyed this movie, its characters and its message: you can succeed, no matter your beginnings or misgivings about yourself. However, while it did not fail utterly in capturing the atmosphere and overall ""feeling"" of the spirit of the first book, it did fall short.<br/><br/>This effort earns a large 7.2/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","There is a classic early 90's ""Far Side"" cartoon of 3 people standing in an otherwise empty room with a banner hanging overhead painted with the letters, 'DLDWWS,' which stands for ""Didn't Like Dances With Wolves Society."" Gary Larson really captured a phenomenon of what I'd call the 'societal embrace.' People look for things to identify with to make them feel like they're a part of mass culture. Enough people give this product their stamp of approval that it nearly becomes propaganda. No person can escape at least making a decision about that product. People are more likely to decide something's good if someone else tells them it's good, even though they would have felt indifferent otherwise. This cultural phenomenon has happened many times, including this year. In late 2001 and early 2002, there was no escape from Harry Potter. (pronounced 'Paw-TUH' because I've rarely heard it said otherwise. Hogwarts, Middle Earth, Ridley Scott, James Bond, Austin Powers, Shrek-talking like a stuffy brit is definitely cool again.)<br/><br/>
With that, I hereby begin DLHPSSS (Didn't Like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Society). The first half hour or so I found interesting. Then I noticed that the film continued to roll, but there was still no sign of an actual story. Poor cute little Harry had no objective. There was no jeopardy. Two hours in, finally, something. There's this magic stone created by the world's most powerful wizard (probably all that's preventing him from mass ridicule over being named Dumbledore), see and-oh never mind. By that time I had ceased to care. I can't remember ever caring less how a film was going to end (or wishing more that one simply would). The ending that did eventually come, frankly, sucked. Then they add to the agony by reminding us that there was the points contest between the houses. I was actually happy when the Slitherin house won. They even ruined that moment for me.<br/><br/>
On the way out, my brother, whom I saw this with, made a good analogy. He said the film was like 'Pirates of the Caribbean' or some other Disneyland ride where you just travel through and watch various animatronic things jump out at you. There's no real story, it's just a bunch of neat things to look at. Same thing with ""Harry Potter."" This is the most offensive kind of film to me, one that passes itself off as cinema, but is really just assorted eye candy. The effects and sets and cute kid actors are designed to make you feel like you've been entertained when you've really just been gypped.<br/><br/>
It's been a long time since ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" has been released, so long that I'd forgotten why I avoided seeing it in the first place. I sensed, knowing that director Chris Columbus had stayed nearly verbatim faithful to the book, that this was a cash cow just waiting to be fed. There was no risk involved for the film's creators, who knew its audience came built in. Now it's up for a Golden Laurel award, which is the Producer's Guild of America's year-end pat on the back for 'excellence in producing a motion picture,' which translates as 'best job of making lots of money on a motion picture.' (Why do movie producers need a guild? No one knows. No one wants to ask. But that's for another time.) The award should be replaced by something that looks more like the one they give the winners of the MTV Movie Awards: a gold-encrusted bucket of popcorn. ""Harry Potter"" producer David Heyman should certainly win for creating the 'movie project that moved the most popcorn at cineplexes worldwide.'<br/><br/>I never believed in the ""Harry Potter"" propaganda and I was right. But there I was, buying a ticket anyway. I sensed a hesitation from the vendor, actually, when I heard 'Harry Paw-TUH' come out of my mouth, like he was giving me one last chance to change my mind. (""Dude, are you sure you want to see THAT movie?"") Curiosity got the best of me. My solace is that there are still a couple of people out there who haven't seen it who can still be saved.

I hadn't read the book first, though subsequently I have, if only to confirm my thoughts.<br/><br/>Well, firstly there's no doubt that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone will be the highest-grossing fim of all time, so if that's all that Warner Bros intended, then they've done a fabulous job. It'll win a hatful of Oscars too, some of which it'll actually deserve. But for all of that, the film's got its own serious weaknesses - and I just don't see why almost to a man, every professional critic has waxed so lyrical about it... I guess that the hype juggernaut has a lot more momentum than I first expected.<br/><br/>Let's deal with the movie's many good points first. The sets are both breath-taking and beautifully executed, the cinematography simply wonderful and the casting director needs a medal, so inspired was the choosing of the actors. Amongst the adults, Maggie Smith is just perfect as the Jean Brodie-esque Professor McGonagall, Robbie Coltrane an endearingly gruff Hagrid, and Alan Rickman as ever steals every scene as the venomous Professor Snape in worryingly threatening jet-black wig. Even Richard Harris, who is rather prone to going way over the top, makes a pleasant Headmaster Dumbledore. This is exactly the type of movie that British actors do so well, and much credit to J.K. Rowling for insisting on a British cast.<br/><br/>But the child stars excel as well, and Chris Columbus shows a sure touch and empathy with his understanding direction of them. Daniel Radcliffe is the embodiment of Harry Potter, even if all he has to do is look suitably amazed most of the time. He is utterly outdone by the totally natural Rupert Grint as the down-to-earth Ron Weasley, and the equally superb take no nonsense Emma Watson as Hermione Granger - everyone knew kids just like these at school. They are completely believable as characters, and not once does their acting lapse into the cutesey or irritating. Much applause again here for there not being some precocious Hollywood bratlet in the cast. That would have entirely destroyed the chemistry.<br/><br/>So after all this praise, what are the problems? It's simple... pace. It's been widely reported that the original director's cut was over 4 hours long, but even at 153 minutes, this film drags. I was clock-watching from half an hour in. There seems to have been a desire to methodically film every last page and scene in the novel - and so the movie is paced like a novel - slow and laborious. But hey, we're talking MOVIE here - it's not a novel. The eye gets to do most of the work in a movie and it's instant. That's why novels need to be ADAPTED when they're filmed, and not religiously and slavishly followed. Plus because this was the approach taken, the essential editing to cut this film down to bearable lengths then has left out chunks of important plot and motivational background. Just to pick two points at random... did anyone actually get the impression that we were watching a whole school year? Could anyone guess *why* Snape hated Harry? I guess we'll need to wait for the ""Director's Cut"" DVD.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The film has plenty to its credit. But its eventual released execution definitively has major pacing issues... it drags. Everyone seems to have got very over-excited about the whole Harry Potter phenomenon as something massively innovative and brand-new. It's not. It's all been done many times before, just not in the last 40 years or so, and so people have forgotten typical English children's literature from that period dealing with ""public school"" and ""jolly good chums"" and ""riproaring adventure"". But maybe it was time for its revival. Next time, please... make it pacier."
"educallejero","4","0","0","2 July 2020"," World building, but excessively boring
","At times, it seems the only objective the director has is presenting ""Harry Potter magical things"" one after the other and that's it. There is no story. The movie is nothing, really. It expects us to be amazed by the score. And the score is great, but no. It doesn't work. And that's more than an hour.<br/><br/>After that, it gets better when the adventure and plot actually starts. There is a sense of pace at least. The scenes are not always as exciting as they could be, but overall it's well done. The kids are good for their age. The second part of the movie is childish by choice and it works.<br/><br/>In the end, I can't consider this good with such a lack of talent shown in the horrendous first part."

","''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a red-blooded adventure movie, dripping with atmosphere, filled with the gruesome and the sublime, and surprisingly faithful to the novel. A lot of things could have gone wrong, and none of them have: Chris Columbus' movie is an enchanting classic that does full justice to a story that was a daunting challenge. The novel by J.K. Rowling was muscular and vivid, and the danger was that the movie would make things too cute and cuddly. It doesn't. Like an ""Indiana Jones"" for younger viewers, it tells a rip-roaring tale of supernatural adventure, where colorful and eccentric characters alternate with scary stuff like a three-headed dog, a pit of tendrils known as the Devil's Snare and a two-faced immortal who drinks unicorn blood. Scary, yes, but not too scary--just scary enough.<br/><br/>Three high-spirited, clear-eyed kids populate the center of the movie. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter, he with the round glasses, and like all of the young characters he looks much as I imagined him, but a little older. He once played David Copperfield on the BBC, and whether Harry will be the hero of his own life in this story is much in doubt at the beginning.<br/><br/>Deposited as a foundling on a suburban doorstep, Harry is raised by his aunt and uncle as a poor relation, then summoned by a blizzard of letters to become a student at Hogwarts School, an Oxbridge for magicians. Our first glimpse of Hogwarts sets the tone for the movie's special effects. Although computers can make anything look realistic, too much realism would be the wrong choice for ""Harry Potter,"" which is a story in which everything, including the sets and locations, should look a little made up. The school, rising on ominous Gothic battlements from a moonlit lake, looks about as real as Xanadu in ""Citizen Kane,"" and its corridors, cellars and great hall, although in some cases making use of real buildings, continue the feeling of an atmospheric book illustration. At Hogwarts, Harry makes two friends and an enemy. The friends are Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), whose merry face and tangled curls give Harry nudges in the direction of lightening up a little, and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), all pluck, luck and untamed talents. The enemy is Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), who will do anything, and plenty besides, to be sure his house places first at the end of the year.<br/><br/>The story you either already know, or do not want to know. What is good to know is that the adult cast, a who's who of British actors, play their roles more or less as if they believed them. There is a broad style of British acting, developed in Christmas pantomimes, which would have been fatal to this material; these actors know that, and dial down to just this side of too much. Watch Alan Rickman drawing out his words until they seem ready to snap, yet somehow staying in character. Maggie Smith, still in the prime of Miss Jean Brodie, is Prof. Minerva McGonagall, who assigns newcomers like Harry to one of the school's four houses. Richard Harris is headmaster Dumbledore, his beard so long that in an Edward Lear poem, birds would nest in it. Robbie Coltrane is the gamekeeper, Hagrid, who has a record of misbehavior and a way of saying very important things and then not believing that he said them.<br/><br/>Computers are used, exuberantly, to create a plausible look in the gravity-defying action scenes. Readers of the book will wonder how the movie visualizes the crucial game of Quidditch. The game, like so much else in the movie, is more or less as I visualized it, and I was reminded of Stephen King's theory that writers practice a form of telepathy, placing ideas and images in the heads of their readers. (The reason some movies don't look like their books may be that some producers don't read them.) If Quidditch is a virtuoso sequence, there are other set pieces of almost equal wizardry. A chess game with life-size, deadly pieces. A room filled with flying keys. The pit of tendrils, already mentioned, and a dark forest where a loathsome creature threatens Harry but is scared away by a centaur. And the dark shadows of Hogwarts library, cellars, hidden passages and dungeons, where an invisibility cloak can keep you out of sight but not out of trouble.<br/><br/>During ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I was pretty sure I was watching a classic, one that will be around for a long time, and make many generations of fans. It takes the time to be good. It doesn't hammer the audience with easy thrills, but cares to tell a story, and to create its characters carefully. Like ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""Star Wars"" and ""E.T.,"" it isn't just a movie but a world with its own magical rules. And some excellent Quidditch players."

","I still can remember 2001 and the night I saw this movie for the very first time.
I wasn't so educated in the field of world cinema then, but even then I knew that a big thing was coming up with this movie. I was young to understand what a window into the world of magic JKR opened, but it was clear to me that every next film of that genre would be made as some kind of copy of this one.
Since Harry Potter was filmed and screened alongside the Lord of the Rings, anyone who loved film-making was privileged to choose their view of magic based on how the two films presented it to the world. I chose the way JKR showed it to the audience with this film. I respected the Lord of the Rings but my imagination and my desire to continue were more on the side of Harry Potter. Today, as an adult person, I can still confirm that I am more a supporter of the magical world of Harry Potter than the Lord of the Rings, but today I understand a lot more things that need to be understood and known in order to adequately characterize and evaluate a film. I will not deal with his comparison with the Lord of the Rings because now I think that these are two films that deserve to be viewed completely separately. The plot of the Harry Potter film is impossible to judge as bad. By showing this world of magic and sorcery, JKR was innovative and the first to give such a thing to our eyes. As the plot cannot be assessed as bad, so the actors in that film cannot be assessed as bad. It was the cream of the acting world that was merged with the then new names that got a chance to become equally famous, and they did. the Costumes, effects and music are surreal and the overall experience of the film is like riding in an unfamiliar world you don't want to get out of. I think that is what made JKR known and loved among the readers and the audience and on the other hand made her continue the story she started. The acting in the film itself is adapted to the youngest viewers but it is so high quality and well integrated with the script that it is interesting to adult viewers as well and I think that is what made this film a classic.
I think it is not a mistake that this film got its sequels in later years because the main advantage of this film was to achieve the effect of timeless instead of the highest quality and that is why today we have the never forgotten Harry Potter and his family who will live for years to come. our. I wouldn't take too long with the rating and features. Suffice it to say THANK YOU JKR."

3) Harry and friend's detention was at Hagrid's? It was too convenient for Harry.
4) The students were asked to go to the Forbidden Forest, although they were strictly forbidden to do so.
5) Hagrid left Harry and Draco alone in the forest.
6) During Quidditch game, Hermione got to the other side so quickly and unnoticeable.
7) What made Harry so special to be a seeker?
8) Hagrid was conveniently too easy to spill things out from his mouth. How could he be trusted by the teachers?
9) Why where there a broom in the room of flying keys?
10) Why could the flying keys not be able to attack Harry and friends?
11) Harry easily spotted the key to open the door.
12) Harry easily got the key to open the door.
13) How proficient was the magical chess? It was easily defeated by children.
14) Professor Quirrell could not even defeat Harry. He could have easily killed Harry with a spell.
15) How could Professor Quirrell easily get into the final room? Did he set the trap?
16) If Professor Quirelle had been in the final room before Harry and friends arrived, how could the key still be outside the chess room?
17) The House Cup point system was subjective. There was no system that regulates how a point is taken or given, by who, and for what actions.
18) If Professor Quirrell's action could lead to extreme danger (Voldemort got free), how could the teachers not do anything about it?"

","Imagine yourself struggling through life everyday under the tyrannical rule of a family that sees you little more than a burden. Then from no where you learn that you are in fact a Wizard. This is the situation Harry Potter finds himself in and the film does much to give you the feel that you are truly entering the magical world of Witches and Wizards. Now this doesn't say that the film doesn't have it's slight quirks that take away from the realism such as blatant switches to cg objects from inanimate real ones. However the film does an excellent job of showing viewers the resolve of Harry Potter in overcoming the many hostile relationships that seem to gravitate toward Harry, many of which stem from people's jealousy and fear. Despite the hardships Harry finds strength in two newly formed friendships which allow him to persevere through the numerous challenges he encounters. Hermione a book smart, strong willed female ready to use her intelligence and level head to help her friends in any way possible and the street smart but at times absent minded Ron who shows a great deal of courage and self sacrifice when the situation calls for it. Together the trio unravel a mystery that if left unsolved would have put Harry's newly discovered world in great peril."

","The first Harry Potter film, and for that reason it had to have an introduction to Hogwarts and how Harry Ron and Hermione became friends. The scenes where Harry meets Ron and Hermione for the first time on the train is a little boring to watch nowadays. It is a vital part of the movie and it had to be there, but I can't deny the scene isn't very spectacular. It wasn't just this scene that was a bit dull though, all the scenes that reveal more of Ron and Hermione's personality are great to watch for the first time but they really lack replay value. They have to be there though for character development For example the scene when Ron making fun of the way Hermione says wingardium leviousa is a little boring to watch now but it's necessary for Ron's character to become as good as it was in later movies.<br/><br/>My other criticism of the movie is there just simply isn't much going on in the first half of the movie, it's just Harry getting used to his lessons at Hogwarts. While these lessons aren't exactly boring, they aren't extremely entertaining scene, not on the same level of entertainment as the later films. But like the train scene, the lesson scenes were crucial to understand how Hogwarts works. The chess game was good and the big reveal at the end was shocking. Overall it's a very good film, it just has a necessary slow start but picks up eventually.<br/><br/>Plot Complexity: 14/20 Emotion (Not including laughs): 8.5/10 Characters: 9.5/10 Consistency: 9.5/10 Laugh Factor: 4/10 - didn't really make me laugh but Harry giving Dudley a pig's tail might make some laugh Scare Factor: 2/10 Sex Factor: 1/10"

It is the first movie in the franchise, therefore it has to dedicate a lot of its run time to building up the Harry Potter universe and the wizarding school of Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Columbus directed this movie beautifully, however especially the costumes, the production design of both Diagon Alley and Hogwarts and of course the enchanting score by John Williams are timeless. In addition, compared to some dated visual effects during the quidditch match, the practical effects are hand-made and therefore still look really good.<br/><br/>Every time I re-visit the world of Harry Potter I am immediately met with 90 minutes of amazement as something magical unfolds in front of my eyes. On rewatch this can feel a little long and time consuming, however what I dislike most about this first instalment is actually the last 30 minutes. Similar to the second entry in the franchise ""Chamber of Secrets"", the movie ends with a lot of exposition heavy scenes and fitting to the age of out main characters, quite childish."

The movie introduced a number of new child actors which would go on to become famous and beloved worldwide as they grew into adulthood.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus's style of direction captured the magic and wonder of the wizarding world that J.K.

The film does a good job with taking all the most important plot elements from the original book and creating a very interesting and wondorous movie with so many memorable scenes.

And the Hogwarts castle was stunning in its grandiosity and still struck me with awe and amazement. The broomstick flying hasn't aged too well as you can tell that they're not really flying when they come in for close-ups, but you can't really blame a movie for being made when it is and the Quidditch game still looked good and felt exciting.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane as Professor Severus Snape and Hagrid respectively were well chosen for the roles and as far as I know, J.K. Rowling had a personal say in their assignments to the roles and it payed off in my opinion. Rickman's soft voice was just what I heard in my head when reading his lines in the books and Coltrane puts just as much likability into Hagrid as I remembered.<br/><br/>Richard Harris and Maggie Smith as Dumbledore and Mcgonagall respectively also did well adding personality and face to those characters. And Rupert Grint stood out as a funny Ron Weasley among our main charcaters. As it is their first meeting with each other, they have to warm up to each other's company, so I Harry is mostly going around being all ""wow, it's amazing, I didn't know that"" but comes around and discovers thing he is not supposed to and getting into trouble as the movie goes on. Hermione is a know-it-all and Malfoy is an arrogant dick. It's a first movie in a coming-of-age story, so that is to be expected.<br/><br/>But I was disappointed with one thing especially, just to round off the faithfulness to the book, because Hermione's character was surprisingly down-played in a couple of crucial areas making up her character growth in the book some of them also could have made a couple of exciting scenes. That made her a little more one-dimensional here, I'll admit.<br/><br/>While some crucial scenes didn't make it, the movie is still good-looking and with some really good choises made for other characters. Add in some fantastic music and you have a fantasy film for the whole family."

","Review:
'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is a fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus. It is based on the novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling and is the film is the first instalment of the Harry Potter film series.
This movie is so well done, and to me seems like it was ahead of its time.
Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has lived under the stairs at his aunt and uncle's house his whole life. But on his 11th birthday, he learns he's a powerful wizard -- with a place waiting for him at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As he learns to harness his newfound powers with the help of the school's kindly headmaster (Richard Harris), Harry uncovers the truth about his parents' deaths -- and about the villain who's to blame.
I would say that the casting of the film is perfect. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. They steal your heart and every scene they are in. Also, the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane make their characters likable.
Sometimes the visuals are better than others, but it was good for being made in 2001. The film has a big runtime, but the script is so tight it feels like it blows by.
Overall, anyone who loves fantasy films and worlds with great visuals, this film is for you. I go back to this movie all the time, and I highly recommend it.
4.5/5"

"nzmichaelclark","9","0","0","10 October 2019"," A Nostalgic Start Of The Journey To The World Of Wizardry
","Harry Potter and The Soccer's Stone is directed by Chris Columbus, and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint. The story: I love how the film always gives the audience a sense of mystery to the audience, always posing the question, who really wants Harry dead? Is it really Snape? What are the three headed dogs really guarding? The way we are introduced to Hogwarts is absolutely brilliant, everything about the place makes me want to get my own letter from Hogwarts- except I am a little bit to old now for such a miracle... The characters that we are introduced to were great casting picks, Daniel Radcliffe is absolutely perfect for Harry Potter, as is Emma Watson for Hermione, and Rupert Grint for Ron. But a character which really shines for me has to be Snape, and by the way, RIP Alan Rickman, you were most definitely hands down the greatest Snape we could ever have for this role. The way he talks is so grim and contradicting, and this really helps by having him being perfectly casted for the role, as he is a pertinent part of the storyline, the one who we really believe might actually be the villain of all this. And because that is cliché that he would be, as a viewer, we are sucked into Harry, Ron, and Hermione's assumptions. So, Alan Rickman as Snape was absolutely magnificent.
Dumbledore, played by Richard Harris, really brings the wisdom to the table with his character, his voice of so much relaxation. But I never really saw this as the Dumbledore who could duel with Voldemort, so while this Dumbledore was perfection when it came to the comforting smile, and heart-warming nature of Dumbledore, I think that's where the other Dumbledore shined the most. But nevertheless, this is not a gripe, as he was done so perfectly in the suiting of this film. The cinematography in the film is so dazzling and vibrant, which is so suiting for this film. The score by John William is such a mesmerising score, giving the film a tone, which really helps film to feel light, but also in the film's darkest moments, not light, but never to daunting or malicious, which really would not suit the film at all. The theme of friendship in this film is also very strong, as this movie really bands the three together. To see these three meet each other on the Hogwarts's Express for the first time is magical on so many levels, because the evolution of these characters is unforgettably well crafted. Now, this film is not without any flaws or gripes. The first part of the film is trying to set up the universe of Harry Potter, and the world building aspect of the film is absolutely phenomenal, but however, does take a long time to do so, especially as there are still seven films to come in the series. When we have been introduced to Hogwarts, and its magical delights, and its characters, when it stops world building, this is a point in the film when it can't help feeling like it's dragging slightly. But when the film hits another climax such as the troll, Quidditch match scenes, the film stops dragging. Talking of the Quidditch match scenes, they haven't aged as well as they could of, but back in the day, the CGI in it was extraordinary. Funny what film has evolved to today. This is really a very minor gripe, but the film does have dragging points throughout its run time, as while this film thoroughly entertaining, it also has so much to set up. The finale of the film is very engaging, as this is where all the mystery without the film is wrapped up. The sequence where Harry flies through the swarm of keys is such a fun sequence. If any of the sequences in the final act of the film was the most memorable before the twist of the film is revealed to us, it would the chess scene. It's such a clever link back to Ron and Harry's game of chess earlier in the film. By the way, poor Ron, your eye rolling meanness during the first act of the film to Hermione can now be very well overlooked. The twist of movie is so great for the first time, and never really get's old for me. Plot twists from this movie really do become part of the gold standard of Harry Potter films, and I love it. Anyhow, through multiple watches of the film, I found at least, that you can see that Quirrell does seem a times a bit suspicious, and that clever little hint is a masterful piece of filmmaking to me. But when you find out it was Quirrell for the first time, the twist in the film really get's you. The first look at Voldemort is interesting, but he's not really the version of the character who sparks it for me, but of course, I'll be talking about the version who is so very well cast in good time (my next review of the next movie), and boy, does he provide!
With that, Harry Potter and The Soccer's Stone is a wonderful look at the world of wizardry and fantasy and is so very nostalgic and memorable. I'm going to give it an A-, and as a Star Ranking, that's a well-deserved solid 9/10."

","Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!"

","Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone (2001) is the first movie of the Harry Potter franchise, directed by Chris Columbus, who directed two first Home Alone movies. This is one of my favorite fantasy movies. There's so much things to see, a lot more than Lord of the Rings.
About the casts, Daniel Radcliffe was chosen to be Harry Potter, the boy who lived, Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. I really love these three characters and I also love it when they team up to discover something. I also like Alan Rickman being Severus Snape (one of my favorite characters). His voice was amazing and I couldn't describe it. And there's Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, one of they characters I hated the most. He's an a-hole, always messed up with Harry Potter and his friends with his dumb friends, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. I really hate Malfoy but I don't hate Felton bacause he acted well being one of our most hated characters. One of my favorite characters is Rubeus Hagrid, a lovable giant who always smile when he saw Harry Potter.
There's lots of magic in this movie. Everything is creative. And the most creative thing is Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It had a creative name (with a Hog). The creative things about Hogwarts is they there're four houses and your personality depends on one of them. Quidditch is a really creative sports. Being in a broomstick hitting and catching a Quaffle or using a bat and hit the Bludgers or maybe catching a Snitch is so much fun but also dangerous. The subjects like Herbology are also really creative. Everything in Hogwarts makes me wanted to be a wizard in there. It's such a great school. You can be far away from your parents just like Harry being away from those stupid Dudleys (they're worse than Malfoy). I also loved the CGI, they made everything looked like real magic or maybe a different dimension. The one problem is when they put their camera behind Harry Potter with a red sweater facing Professor Quirrel looked like a video game. I don't know how it happened but it was like a video game from my perspective.
The Original Score from John Williams is so iconic. It was perfect for the movie and everytime you come to a Harry Potter Wizarding World, you'll hear the score played and it will bring you to the place itself.
The Harry Potter Universe is my favorite world. There's creative magic and J.K Rowling is creative. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer Stone is one of the greatest movies that filled your childhood with dreams and joys. Though it's not my favorite of the franchise but the movie is the greatest introduction to this franchise.<br/><br/>Points: 8.4/10"

"mark.waltz","9","0","0","27 September 2017"," Hogwarts or hogwash?
","While not a reader of the books, I take this series as pure escapism, total fantasy and not a promotion extolling the virtues of witchcraft. In fact, I think it does just the opposite, showing how dangerous it is to flirt with the dark arts, that life is better left to chance, and that while spells and incantations might seem an easy way to get what one desires, those methods aren't generally realistic. The first episode of the long movie series gets every detail letter perfect and <br/><br/>Making an astonishing debut as this character, Daniel Radcliffe shines like a young Jackie Coogan in ""The Kid"", Jackie Cooper in ""Skippy"" and Mickey Rooney in anything before 1940. He had already appeared with Maggie Smith in a BBC version of ""David Copperfield"", so their reuniting for this was blessed with magic for the second time. Along with head wizard Richard Harris and Hogwarts groundsman Robbie Coltrane, Smith must hide the baby Harry, dropping him off with mentally abusive aunt and uncle Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths who baby their obnoxious son while mistreating Harry and keeping vital letters from him concerning his destiny. <br/><br/>Once Harry gets to Hogwarts, it's worse for him when he finds his name already known and instant enemies because of that. But there's instant friendship with the brilliant but cocky Hermione (Emma Watson) and the awkward Ron (Rupert Grint) who become involved in Harry's adventures, fighting against ugly trolls, jealous students and the very mysterious Alan Rickman who seems to be as evil as he looks. But greater evil exists in the form of the mysterious Voldemort, rumored to be responsible for the brutal murder of Harry's parents. This was the start of many adventures and capers that Harry and his gang would become involved with, some more outlandish than the others. <br/><br/>While the young leads were obviously the focus of attention for the target audience of teenagers, more mature audiences can sit back and enjoy the adults. If Agnes Moorehead was once accused of playing a witch like a nun and a nun like a witch, Maggie Smith played both those characters as if she was a great lady of British noble birth. Richard Harris makes Dumbledore a brother like character to ""Camelot's"" Merlin. The snake like Ruckman is delightfully slow speaking to add mystery.<br/><br/>Technically, this is fascinating, whether it be the students entry into Victoria Station's track at 9 3/4, the soccer like game Harry becomes a key player in, and of course, the chess match finale. As far as modern day fantasies go, this is tops, although some of the series can't compare with the first. Other modern series on film of similar nature owe their start to this entry in the ""Harry Potter"" series."

","Orphaned not long after his birth, ""Harry Potter"" (Daniel Radcliffe) is forced to live in the home of his only living relatives who treat him rather badly. That all changes one day when he is informed by a man named ""Rebeus Hagrid"" (Robbie Coltrane) that his parents were famous magicians and because of that he is invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Needless to say, Harry accepts almost immediately and after Hagrid and he buy the necessary school equipment he begins his journey to the mystical academy. It's then that he meets two fellow students named ""Ron Weasley"" (Rupert Grint) and ""Hermione Granger"" (Emma Watson) who become his good friends and share in his triumphs and travails. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film was based on the very successful book ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" by J.K. Rowling and from what I understand remains quite faithful to the book. At least for the most part. In any case, I found it to be a fine fantasy film with the interaction between Harry and his two friends especially entertaining. Admittedly, there are some slow parts here and there and it does run a bit long (152 minutes).

","As a kid back in 2001 I was a huge fan of Harry Potter I thought it was really good back in the day but as time went by I noticed that the films were getting darker. <br/><br/>The first Harry Potter film centers on Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe)who was left at the footsteps by Professor Dumbledore and Maggie Smith's character many years ago when Harry was just a baby as Harry's parents died and its not safe for Harry to be with Dumbledore since a charcther called he who must not be named(Voldermort)wants him dead. Years later and Harry ends up living with his aunt and uncle who treat Harry like dirt. Of course what Harry doesn't know is that his really a wizard and is sent to Hogwarts where he meets Ron Weasley(Rupert Grint) and sassy bookworm Hermoine Granger(Emma Watson in her movie debut)who become friends with Harry and complete together in the wizardry classes.Harry later meets a giant called Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane) and the two become close unaware that Hagrid actually seen Harry when he was a baby. But when a new teacher starts in Hogwarts Professor Quill(played by Ian Hart),Harry's forehead starts stinging(since he has a thunder mark on his forehead). Who is Professor Quill and is he all he seems?<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this one a lot as a kid,I haven't seen it in years as I used to have it on VHS but now I own it on DVD as I got rid of the VHS many years ago. The effects are very good and the acting is solid too. Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter no question about it he nailed it as Harry Potter from 2001 to 2012. Emma Watson was actually fairly good too yet you know this was her film debut as her acting was sub par. Rupert Grint was hilarious as Ron Weasley as he always acts like a scared cat and he can't stand Hermoine Granger as they have an off/on relationship Be warned though as the last 15 minutes of this may scare younger children especially when one character turns out to be ""He Who Must Not Be Named"" but is possessing a character. <br/><br/>Bottom line if you haven't seen Harry Potter try and track it down and re-watch it again as it is a very good film,<br/><br/>B-

","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series and J. K. Rowling's debut novel, first published in 1997 by Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by Scholastic Corporation in 1998. The plot follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage as he makes close friends and a few enemies in his first year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With the help of his friends, Harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just a year old.<br/><br/>The novel won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least sixty-seven other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of its sequels.<br/><br/>When I watched the film, I was excited because Harry Potter, his friends and his teachers use various magic. I had longing for the magic. However the film is so long, so I am tired."

","Chris Columbus' faltering direction leaves much to be desired from this otherwise magical first entry into the Potter film franchise.<br/><br/>Steve Kloves delivers an inspired conversion of Rowling's classic first installment into a screenplay - giving much potential for a capable director to produce a magical film. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Chris Columbus is not an example of such a director; he almost manages to destroy this script, delivering a painfully static, overly faithful interpretation of a timeless children's classic. Yes, Columbus does leave a sense of welcome innocence on the finished product, but only in the same way as he did with Home Alone. <br/><br/>Thankfully, an outstanding cast of British actors cleans some egg off the producer's faces. The magical casting department chose a cast who would deliver some fantastic performances. Richard Harris (Professor Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) and John Hurt (Ollivander) all give staggering renditions of their timeless characters. Alan Rickman's Severus Snape proves to be the most incredible performance piece in this picture - he makes Snape his own, bringing all the malice, hidden bravery and dark sarcasm needed to perfectly portray his character. <br/><br/>Disregarding the Columbus blunder, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone proves itself to be a magical piece of cinema which will surely be enjoyed by audiences both young and old for many generations to come.<br/><br/>Directing: 1/10||Cinematography: 8/10||Acting:7/10||Verdict: 5.3/10"

","Lord Voldemort, Hogwarts, magic wands, Dumbledore, trolls, Hermione, Gringots, more trolls, magic, centors, Hagrid...? The creativity from author J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" franchise is nothing short of miraculous. Rowling has added another chapter to the list of fantasy classics with her artistic style of writing and rags to riches story of success. Now of course her story enters the cinema. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the first of seven Harry Potter stories, and a strong set up for this long, magical, and complex story of heroism and imagination. Director Chris Columbus brings us into the thoughts of J.K. Rowling's brilliant mind and shows us a world like no other. His biggest issue is that he makes it too childish. Adding some more sophistication and depth to this magical story is a big chunk missing. But enough of that. The first increment of this marvelous legacy comes to play in a fantastic and adventurous style that all will love. Starting out, rescued from the outrageous neglect of his aunt and uncle, a young boy with a great destiny (Harry) proves his worth while attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry while meeting Ron and Hermione and tackling down the evil Lord Voldemort. If you don't know who any of those characters are, you really need to start paying attention. Seeing these now millionaire actors start off as little kids is also a joyous experiment. With all the magic and fantasy plopping your way, you won't help but smile at the insight and brilliance of this fantastic world invented for pages, but meant for the screen that has brought passion to the lives of millions."
"CherryBlossomBoy","Null","0","0","12 February 2015"," And the award for ""Miscasting of the decade"" goes to...
","...the director, Chris Columbus!<br/><br/>Apparently, according to ""Trivia"" section on IMDb, the only reason Columbus got the gig of directing ""Harry Potter"", essentially a satirical piece, was his previous experience in working with child actors. According to the same section, the first choice for directing was none other than Terry Gilliam, the master of satire, and all I can say is ""why the hell didn't they go with him???"".<br/><br/>After carefully avoiding the whole craze about ""Harry Potter"" serial ever since its inception, I finally got to see this first movie upon a recommendation. I don't like fantasy and sorcery themes, so I didn't read the novels either, but I appreciate a good spoof and satire of anything. So, despite not being entirely familiar with the concept, I could immediately recognize satirical elements, because of the dialogue and the way situations and scenes were written - in a specifically dark and humorous English manner. What I also noted is how distant and restrained and overly superficial the direction is, which brings me back to the choice of director.<br/><br/>Was experience with child actors really, really the most important requirement for a director's seat here? Sure Columbus had plenty. He was also hugely successful with ""Home Alone"" flicks. However, while his superficial, distant, flamboyant style was effective and quite suitable in a Christmas flick - here it brought nothing but disinterest in this viewer. Harry Potter is not physical comedy, nor is it meant to be a cookie-cutter, family oriented cinema. Columbus made it exactly that. Perhaps he has no clue or interest to do things otherwise, perhaps producers didn't want him to. And perhaps all he had to do is to bring the camera a little closer and more personal, and maybe edit it with more pace.<br/><br/>That's what Gilliam knows how to do. He may be an American, like Columbus, but he knows all about the quirks of British humour. He is also long-proved expert in satirical approach to themes, just take a look at his Monty Python opus, or the ""12 Monkeys"" blockbuster. I can't help but think what could have become of this series if he, or somebody like him, took charge. No doubt a good and memorable film, perhaps even a masterpiece and certainly not a forgettable ""Goonies in England"" borefest. The absence of satirical angle ruins the whole effort and turns it into a clichéd ""quick-cash-in"", while the original intent was to toy with clichés and make fun of them. But I guess Columbus' experience with child actors is what counts, right?<br/><br/>Mind you, that experience doesn't show here at all. The young cast is borderline annoying, naturally inexperienced and obviously poorly guided. The film was saved by veteran adult supporting cast, especially Alan Rickman and Kenneth Brannagh. Anyway, failing to cast Gilliam as the director of ""Harry Potter"" is for me somewhere up there in the top ten of colossal Hollywood blunders, along with failing to cast Kevin Kline as Peter Pan in ""Hook"", Tom Selleck as Indiana Jones in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", or Sissy Spacek as Princess Leia in ""Star Wars""."

","I recently re-watched this and i have to say it does strike me as one of the weaker Harry Potter films. Somewhat due to the period of time released and somewhat due to some of the story lines in this movie were a bit iffy in my opinion. I felt some of the stuff in here was slightly overacted from both Potter, Ron, Hermione, that doesn't compare to any of the other films. The start of the film was slightly weak for me, I got slightly bored in the first 40 minutes, it was elongated in parts. The general story when he got to the school was good for me, I have to say. The idea with the Forrest and early connection was a good one and I did really like the build to the end with the Chess game which was done so very well by all actors and effects made, best part in the movie. The ending as well was done very well which actually somewhat save the movie one could say. Overall a pretty decent movie saved by the last hour which was awesome. I would probably rate this about 6 to be honest."

","Undoubtedly targeted at a very young audience, there's a certain degree of magic dancing around this picture that makes it easily-accessible to adults as well. Although my own childhood was long gone by the time this hit theaters, watching it today was like leaping back through time to an age filled with innocence and wonder. That effect does occasionally get lathered on a bit thick, but a speedy pace and densely populated realm are usually enough to compensate for such moments. JK Rowling's rich, sprawling, imaginative world is downright hypnotizing on the screen, loaded with treats and treasures, and it's tough to look away for even an instant. Although the CGI work is distractingly bad in a few instances (it very nearly ruins the Quidditch match), the child actors are average at best and there isn't much adversity to our heroes' hunt for the MacGuffin Stone, it's still a cheery, entertaining introduction to a universe that's positively buzzing with potential."

But the worst offender is the generic, intrusively over-active score.<br/><br/>Despite all the flaws, the story carries you along.

","By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.<br/><br/>I've always avoided Harry Potter as what little I had heard about the books and movies did not appeal to me. The one thing that I had seen was a sequence from this first film of the Quidditch game and this was enough to put me off for all the intervening years. There are plenty of interesting theories on the origin of witches and broomsticks but kids using broomsticks to play a ball game is not one of them. This sequence was still the one I really, really disliked in the film and I groaned every time Quidditch sequences appeared in subsequent films.<br/><br/>Two things surprised me about this film (and was borne out by the subsequent ones). Firstly they aren't about magic and witchcraft at all. In fact the nearest anyone ever gets to magic is waving a wand a speaking a couple of cod Latin words. Secondly they are primarily about life in a boarding school and perhaps should have been called ""Harry of the Second Remove and his Magic Wand"" or perhaps ""Hermione of the Sixth and her  "" (On second thoughts let's not go there).<br/><br/>None of these comments mean that I did not like the film nor that I thought it was bad. On the contrary, once I got past my preconceptions, I thoroughly enjoyed this excellent family film. It worked brilliantly on the level of Harry's ill treatment at the hands of his adoptive parents, his integration into the school and the beginning of the introduction of the external threats to his world. It was well directed, funny and always engaging.<br/><br/>The young cast did well although they clearly had a long way to go. Daniel Radcliffe sometimes looked as though he had been well tutored in the art of pulling particular faces to express different emotions though his eyes didn't always show he had internalised them. Rupert Grint was probably the best of the young actors. The adult actors were uniformly good and the decision to work only with British thesps was clearly the right one."

There were undoubtedly some major and minor differences but I felt almost all of these were perfectly fine. Obviously it's impossible to include every aspect but there were some things that I think they could've/should've done differently. For one, I understand you can't add everything and that some things might have to be changed in order to make the movie work but if that's the case, why add things that are completely unnecessary? For example, the moving stairs. As for the things taken out or changes, I have no problem with all of them, except one. In the end when they're making their way through the various challenges, they took out Snape's potion riddle. To me, that was the second most important and memorable challenge of them all behind the chess challenge. This would've only added another minute or two and should've been included in the movie. Nonetheless, this was a well done book-to-movie adaptation. The acting of some of the students left a little to be desired but it wasn't too bad and I've heard it improves as they, and the book/movies age."

The film features Harry Potter going to wizard school for the first time. His aunt and uncle keep him living in a closet so going to wizard school or heck math camp would be a nice change of pace for the kid. Well when he goes to school he makes friends quickly with this lass and red headed boy and these three would grow up into some very poorly photogenic to old for the roles adults. Seriously, they looked like they were stoned on the DVD cover of Deathly Hallows and all three just do not look like the type of people you put in movies. Well Harry quickly becomes adept at the sport of wizardry Quiditch which involves flying around on a broom and scoring points. I know, when I hear flying brooms I think witches and witchcraft, but this is wizard school cause that is what the author says! There is also a bit of a mystery to be solved and an ending that will become very familiar with those who enjoy this series. I did not care for this one and I never continued following Harry's adventures, I am not going to fault those who do, this set of films just was not for me and man they are going on to long.

Of course, the fans will be pleased, like this film over the next films but it's dull and unimaginative. It's entertaining, visually impressive, well acted, so close to perfection but so inoffensive, lacking in anything. Maybe the director should stop caring about what other people think, follow artistic instincts yet still keep to the plot. It's hard to find any sense of magic in here.

I'm just surprised that even though everything is adapted accurately, the film manages to be colossally dull while the novel was highly interesting. Upon musing about this, I realized that it's primely the cause of the outdated visual effects. Other than that, the magical world is depicted as if the setting is that of the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. A little modern look could've helped a lot.<br/><br/>The acting - like the movie - is strictly average. The kids seem a little too childish and the background score sometimes feel over the top; I loved Hedwig's theme though. The direction is to be blamed for the lack or rather incompetence of the correct emphasis on certain scenes. Some irrelevant scenes feel the same as the climax, there is nothing to differentiate. Harry's Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and his bully cousin are presented more as cartoon characters which makes the watcher refrain from taking the movie seriously. Therefore, it's supposedly viewed as a children's movie with little or no entertainment and a dull setting. <br/><br/>The only thing worth watching is the unfolding of the manner in which the magical world works, since this is the first installment. <br/><br/>I hope the sequels are going to improve and provide justice to J.K.

But all in all, and I have to be serious, I'd say that both the performances of (especially) Grint and Watson were worthy of Razzie nominations (of course, if black children had done better jobs in a different film, they'd have WON the Razzies, since we live in that kind of world), but the only reason they weren't nominated was the fact that it was a Harry Potter movie.<br/><br/>Good story, great special effects, mediocre acting from the children, but great acting from the adults (Alan Rickman's Oscar is ridiculously overdue now). 6 out of 10 stars."

Of course, there's been very little in the fantasy genre or the children's genre that has been of note for years now...and this is no exception.<br/><br/>If you have kids, and they are fans, sit through it with them. But unless someone makes you, I wouldn't bother. You wouldn't be missing anything. And when those folks (and there will be) shriek like banshees when you've told them you've not seen (or maybe even read) any of the Harry Potter stream-of-the-usual, just shrug and walk away knowing you probably spent several hours of your life doing something more memorable."

","The first film in the epic ""Harry Potter"" series, directed by kiddie-movie specialist Chris Columbus, feels a bit slight compared to some of the stories that followed it, but there are many delights here for both Potter fans and fantasy movie fans in general. The fun of the movie always feels a bit contrived and forced, which I think is mostly the fault of the director. But on the other hand a wonderful cast was brought together for this film, a cast which formed the core of the solid ensemble that carried through the rest of the film series (so far). By that I mean not so much the 3 primary child actors, who in this film showed no particular flair or talent (though they look and feel right good casting as opposed to good performing, for the most part) but moreso the supporting cast of mostly British actors.<br/><br/>Me, I gotta confess  I love my villains. Give me Vincent Price anyday over Errol Flynn and I'll take Boris Karloff for Clark Gable. So I have to give it up first and foremost to Harry Potter's main man, Severus Snape  a brilliant performance by Alan Rickman that holds the movie together just as much if not more than Richard Harris' dignified take on Albus Dumbledore (which I find superior to the actor in the later films). Snape's character has a lot to do with the success of the film, because he must be oily and underhanded but at the same time complex enough to make the resolution believable. It's a really fun cast all around, with fantasy stalwarts like Warwick Davis peppering a cast of the U.K.'s finest character actors. Maggie Smith's work as Professor McGononagall is particularly spot-on, and the legendary Robbie Coltrane provides humor and personality as the perfect film version of Hagrid.<br/><br/>I think the action scenes feel a bit generic perhaps it's part of the downfall of the visual medium as opposed to the literary one, but the magic and so forth just doesn't have the humor and quirkiness of the book. My only other real problem with the film is the soundtrack, which is also very generic. John Williams seems to have been in a certain default mode for the last 20 years and this film was no exception. I'm glad they replaced the score in some of the later films with something more interesting and unique to befit the stories. With Williams' score lurching underneath all the action a lot of this film feels more ordinary than it should.<br/><br/>But the story is relatively faithful to the book, which is nice, and this is probably the easiest of all the books to adapt into a film. It's impossible not to feel charmed by the spirit of fantasy as we watch all the ""first-years"" clamber onboard the Hogwarts Express to trade tales of Wizarding and Bertie Botts Every-flavor Beans. Unlike some of the later films (particularly ""Goblet of Fire"") the movie doesn't just feel like an accessory to the books  although it has a very long running time this film stands alone more than the later stories.<br/><br/>A pretty good introduction to the Potter universe, when all is said and done, but not an exceptional fantasy film on its own merits."

","Having just reviewed Order of The Phoenix I thought I'd better add a few comments about the previous movies. Each time I see a new Harry Potter film I'm tempted to say ""Gosh, how they've grown""! It seems a long time ago now that the first in the series appeared.<br/><br/>And a recent viewing confirms what I've always thought about this film; the casting couldn't have been better. The young leads, Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are fine, and a wonderful ensemble of actors lend enjoyable support. Could you imagine anyone other than Robbie Coltrane playing Hagrid? Alan Rickman is also perfectly cast as Professor Snape. And I haven't even mentioned Richard Harris and Maggie Smith yet! It's a huge shame Harris is no longer with us to appear in the series; Michael Gambon gives a different interpretation to Dumbledore, and frankly I don't think he's nailed the role as well as Harris. I've yet to see Maggie Smith give a bad performance. This film is no exception.<br/><br/>I'm not going to discuss the plot - it's too well known to need comment, but there are some narrative problems with the film. It's a little unfocused for much of it's length, but this can be forgiven as it has to set the scene and balance the story for the audience members unfamiliar with the book. The effects are nicely done and John Williams' main theme grows on you. I didn't care much for his score when the film came out but will cheerfully admit to being in error. It isn't his best work but is still of a very high standard indeed. The effects are also fine - I particularly liked Firenze. Yeah, it's all CGI but it suits the tone of the material.<br/><br/>One has to say the film is a little bland; the studio obviously did not want to take too many risks with the book's legion of fans, but it does it job - to entertain and set things up for the following films. Chris Columbus directs adequately but without adding any real flavour to things.<br/><br/>All things considered: a respectable and solid start to the series."

","Harry Potter is miserable. His family hates him. They give him hell. But that all changes soon enough when a giant named Hagrid arrives to take Harry off to a school for witches and wizards. He departs on a fantastical adventure that he could only achieve in his wildest dreams--only this time, it's all too real.<br/><br/>Based upon the novel 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone', this is currently the fourth highest-grossing movie of all time. It was hyped up so much--particularly from the fans of the wildly popular books. JK Rowling didn't know what she was getting herself into, I'm sure, when she scribbled down the first few chapters of her saga in that London coffee bar. She sparked a near-cultural phenomenon.<br/><br/>Too bad it didn't live up to it's hype in terms of quality (I think). It was decent enough for an adaptation, but overall, you could put the standard 'book-is-better-than-the-movie' excuse here. It did make its fair share of money though.<br/><br/>The direction was way too generic. Chris Colombus, while his career consists of mainly child-films, was an okay choice for the role of director. But his style is not as specific as I would've liked. He gives the film a light-heartedness that is not quite appropriate. The book is much darker I think in terms of themes and story. Too bad Terry Gilliam did not sign on.<br/><br/>The acting is decidedly average for the cast members appearing. The kids did okay for their age. It's a good thing that they grow up through the later films. Other cast members such as Robbie Coltrane (although perfect for the character he played) and Alan Rickman (also perfect) did not perform to the best of their abilities, methinks. Richard Harris was quite impressive though.<br/><br/>The script by Steve Klovis was not very impressive. I thought the dialog was cheesy and childish. The screenplay was too full of cute child moments that I really don't like, although these kinds of things will suit family viewings (which is what the studio was aiming for in the first place).<br/><br/>Overall, this is a decent enough adaptation although I did not like it as much as I would've liked.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The thing with the film versions of the Potter books is that they are never like the books. Almost every scene is nothing like the words used in the book. For instance, in the end scene in the cavern with the giant mirrorof erised, Voldemort says that there is no evil or good, but power. However, in the book, it is Quirell who says that. The acting is questionable. I could rant on and on about the things i hate, but i might as well say the things that are good about it. I rate it 4/10. For a movie, 8/10. For a harry Potter adaption, 1/10. If you haven't read the novel you won't understand whats going on, but at least this one basically follows the plot line unlike Azkaban.

","spoilers... sorta....<br/><br/>The public needs to separate their movie experiences from their literary ones.<br/><br/>While one might inspire the other, and vice versa, a movie should not be judged against what was experienced in the literary work which inspired it. They are two completely different animals, and in some ways, this dichotomy is unravelling the authenticity of storytelling in general. (If you haven't enjoyed some human to human oral storytelling, please give it a shot, whether it is folklore, fiction, fantasy, reading bedtime stories to you kids, or going to your house of worship.) In many cultures traditions are passed down orally and this was the main method of communication (and entertainment) prior to the development of written text. yadda yadda - <br/><br/>Having said this, I just watched HP&tSorcerer's Stone on television (and i have not read the books, maybe someday I will?) As for the film. It seems many people are just overall fans of the Harry Potter phenomenon. No different from anyone who posts 10/10 comments on any other movie which happens to be their favorites. Sometimes I wish IMDb would create a sort of tag which allows people to categorize their comments. (this would save me time having to read through a whole bunch of comments which are basically fans saying yes I really like this movie too...) There is definitely a time and place for that, and room too, but as I said,and I would imagine I am not alone, in that there are those of us who are interested in reading more unbiased critiques rather than either blatantly positive or overtly negative views. <br/><br/>That said, I found a few very enjoyable moments and images in HPATSS, I can see for sure why children are drawn to it. Maybe it is in some ways a ""gateway"" narrative to the more dense Tolkein works. My impression is that this movie is geared toward kids in elementary school and through junior high.<br/><br/>The issue of the CGI is highly debatable, some reviewers propose that the movie should be somehow shot with lower-tech (Jim Henson) techniques. I agree with this but I am also aware of the nostalgic factor and I wonder if somehow since many of us grew up on the original Star Wars and (Henson) styled Sesame Street, we link his work with our youth and then interpret that style to be superior. This could be. Will our children, once fully grown, interpret CGI to be superior since they will associate it with their youth? And what will replace CGI? - this is the stuff of science fiction. But to thwart that whole debate, personally I really find an affinity toward the more analog (puppets) and Disney's hand drawn animation, rather than a mesh of CGI and digital film. - note - such films as Toy Story and Sharks Tale, and the (to be seen) Polar Express, which are completely CGI are better views. <br/><br/>Compare Potter with another children's protagonist - Fievel Mousekewitz, from An American Tale. While both are ""special,"" and stumble through their stories almost destined like trains on rails to their climax and endings, it is Fievel who comes across as the better developed character. Potter on the other hand is constantly told almost from the beginning of the movie that he is famous, that he is special, so he must live up to this. It is somewhat surprising how this is done. <br/><br/>Unlike Luke Skywalker, or Fievel, or the majority of major motion picture protagonists, Potter is somewhat blase', and is guided along though the whole film by a giant, the heads of the school, and his smart female and comic relief honcho sidekicks. The surprise is of course that what this is all building to is a ""fight scene"" which ends in a most bizarre manner, the villain crumbling at the<br/><br/>mere touch of Harry Potter, to which he cries in agony, ""what magic is this?"" This is a most unusual confrontation and defeat. What is even more awkward is, (and m aybe i missed this), but I didn't really know why this happen. To which the very next scene explains. The fact that they needed to tell us why it happened ill ustrates that there is something major wrong with the narrative. In a good mov ie we would have known why this villain is crumbling. Did I miss that part, please fill me in, was there any foreshadowing there? <br/><br/>Oh, one more thing that was kind of annoying was the portrayal of the chess match near the end. Now understood, that it is difficult (extremely difficult) to communicate the complexities of ches s to the age group this movie is gear toward, but cutting from shot to shot of random chess pieces being destroyed was rather pointless, and it came across t o me as rather hollow. There could have been an attempt to maybe at least demons trate some of the very basic moves in chess. And I also didn't understand exac tly why Potter's buddy HAD to hold tight to the knight, how come Harry was able to walk on the chess board? It lost me. <br/><br/>However as positives, there are bunch, such as the presentation of the villain in the climax scene, the whole thing about unicorns blood and drinking unicorns blood, that resonated with me somehow, and how it was all silvery and such, this seemed very 2001, yeah, and what else. Harry Potter looks a lot like my friend David Fishel, so that made me feel good, (even though Dave is like 6'8"") - maybe it's those Gandhi / Lennon spectacles, who knows... It was also refreshing to see the presentation of all the witchcraft and ""magic"" in such a matter of fact way, I think that is actually the motivating charisma of the venture is that it's a relatively subdued presentation of the eccentric, bizarre, and out and out balderdash. Somehow in the vein of the Reiner's Princess Bride, (sorta, maybe a stretch) - but what i am trying to say is that i appreciated the frankness with which the cast displayed in their performances. For what it's worth.<br/><br/>Overall some what enjoyable, not on any top tens at this writing in my book, i give it a 6.5/10 mostly for the chess blunder and questions concerning story and character development."

","Thank God the acting got better. Most of the lines sounded rehearsed, especially Daniel Radcliffe's. I'll give them some credit for acting simply because over the course of the next movies, they did get a bit better, but it's sad when I've only had 2 months of training in drama and I can act better than some of the actors in this movie.<br/><br/>I did like how Rupert Grint played Ron, he seemed like the type of person I imagined he would be (maybe that's because I read the book after seeing the movie, but it still fit to me). Some of the lines seemed pointless, like people constantly explaining what they were doing even though anyone with a brain could figure it out for themselves.<br/><br/>The score could have used a little help, but overall, it sounded suitably ""magical"" to me, even though Howard Shore could have probably made it better, and I like most of John Williams' work. My main problem was with how repetitive the music was. Over and over, the same song. I'm all for listening to songs a lot, but there is such thing as too much.<br/><br/>The storyline was good until I read the book and realized just HOW MUCH THEY CUT OUT OF THE MOVIE!!! I understand that they would have had a 5-hour movie if they put everything in it, but they cut out all of the good parts of the book. I wish they had decided to use a different director early on instead of for the third movie, because it seemed like Chris Columbus thought that the sheer publicity would make up for all the things he cut out.<br/><br/>I know I'm making it sound bad, but there were a lot of things that could use some help. I did like the movie overall, but, like I said, there were plenty of things that stuck with me as being extremely annoying. I think that Chris Columbus just didn't do JK Rowling's book justice in this movie, and you'd have to read the book just to get the storyline, when you should get it out of the movie."

It cannot be easy playing a character from a book that many children and adults have read about and have their own picture of that character but all the actors do this brilliantly. After reading the book and then watching the film again I am happy to say that there is no problem with the film. Christopher Columbus has put this book to screen with no faults.

"TheBabblingFool","Null","0","0","5 June 2004"," Boring for those who haven't read the books.
","Just to let you know, I have not read a single word of any Harry Potter books.<br/><br/>I recently rewatched this Harry Potter flick before diving into the second Harry Potter film. The first time I watched this flick a year or two ago I bashed it, and considered it one of the worst films I have ever seen. I basically rewatched it because I heard that the second film, Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, was an improvement but I felt it was nessesary for me to refresh myself with the Potter universe before delving into that film. Watching it a second time, I don't consider it one of the worst films I have ever seen, just a flawed and boring one.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is that it spends no time with furthuring the plot, not at least until the last forty minutes or so. Until then the audience is subjected to introducing every single minute detail of this Hogwarts school. The film does this by simply throwing little scenes together where some magical stuff happens and they expect any of us watching to gaze and wonder in awe about this magic. I'm sure people who read the books are sitting there, recognizing this scene and that scene from what they have read and are having a jolly old time. I sit there and wonder what this has to do with the plot and why I should care. <br/><br/>A movie has the problem that it expects everyone to have read the book, and a movie can't do that. That is the fatal flaw of this film.<br/><br/>Other than that, the film is full of decent performances by the kids, sometimes good, sometimes their lack of acting made me want to cringe. The supporting cast, made up of probably every character actor in England, are well played and enjoyable to watch, especially Alan Rickman who with that black wig on looks like the lead singer of Nine Inch Nails. The film also has lavish sets, some both great and horrid special FX, and yet another fantastic score by John Williams (the man can do no wrong).<br/><br/>So in the end, if you love the books memorized every page, go see this, you'll enjoy it. If you just want to watch the movies, skip this flick and see The Chamber of Secrets, it's much better, it actually has a plot."
"rapt0r_claw-1","Null","0","0","3 June 2004"," A decent movie, but incredibly overrated.
","'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is the first installment of the Harry Potter books on-screen. Certainly it is better made than the sequel, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'. However, I believe the best of the series is yet to come, as the first two books were a bit weak.<br/><br/>
I liked this movie when I first saw it, and was overrating it EXTREMELY when it first came out, and praised without glancing at the flaws. Three years later, I have been disillusioned. <br/><br/>The biggest screw-up was nothing but a minor hitch, but it mattered a lot. At one point in the movie, after talking about the 'Sorcerer's Stone' endlessly, Daniel Radcliffe says 'Philosopher's Stone'. What does this say about the editing? Nothing good.<br/><br/>Steve Cloves' adaptation from Rowling's book is a mixed bag. Instead of butchering the source material as he did in 'The Chamber of Secrets', Cloves stayed true to the story, cutting some obstacles along the way. But had these rejected scenes been retained, the movie would be a solid bit of storytelling, and the introduction might not have been a third of the runtime. I don't mean the movie should have been longer, only that the introduction should have been shorter. The movie is too long. <br/><br/>
One of the things that saves the movie is the special effects team. Fluffy is utterly believable as a flesh-and-bone dog, no matter how bizarre he might be. That is an achievement, as many fantastical creatures out of stories look like just that: fake and fantasy. <br/><br/>'The Sorcerer's Stone' is at its best when showing off some special effects and mixing action with drama and suspense. The epic game of Wizard's Chess is the highlight, followed by the final Voldemort scene. The Quidditch match is exciting, and again, completely believable. No one could raise an objection saying, 'They don't look like they're flying.' Because they do.<br/><br/>
The adult acting in the movie is solid, and I have no complaints. Richard Harris as Dumbledore is a gem. Harris will always be my Dumbledore, and cannot be replaced (although he will be). May he rest in peace.<br/><br/>
The young actors, however, leave much to be desired. Emma Watson as Hermione is the best, although she could be better. At times she pulls off an emotional look well, at other times it's flat and robotic. Rupert Grint (Ron) is abysmal. Every syllable he speaks makes his face twitch violently. Every would-be emotional expression looks like a painful convulsion. The exaggeration is beyond such words. Daniel Radcliffe is the title Potter, and shows better acting ability than Grint. He's better in this movie than the sequel, and seems just the balance between Watson's decency and Grint's absolute idiocy. Three of each kind. Lucius Malfoy is better than all three, but he still messed up a few times. <br/><br/>The Harry Potter series should get better with 'The Prisoner of Azkaban'. But the following books, composed of several hundreds of pages of fascinating storytelling, might simply be beyond the scope of this decade's filmmaking possibilities. At least for now, 'The Sorcerer's Stone' hasn't ruined the series, and convinced some viewers to keep track of the series like bloodhounds. Potter will live to fight another year, but only just."

","HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE / Directed by Chris Columbus / Written by Steve Kloves / Running Time: 152 minutes / Rated PG / Capsule Review / Score: ***<br/><br/>
'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a story that probably would've suited better as a four to eight hour miniseries. Not to say the movie is a bad one. Far from it. It is mostly enchanting, a faithful adaptation of a masterful book. Director Chris Columbus makes a solid but not daring effort to bringing the story to a visual medium. The computer-generated images are impressive and the production design has an Arthurian appeal to them. While the story is being told wonderfully with these visuals, however, the plot is buried under special effects. Radcliffe, Grint and the charming Watson are fitting for their roles, and many of the adult actors outshine the set pieces. The titular 'Sorcerer's Stone', however, is not mentioned (and does not come into play) until the movie's third act. The movie should have been titled 'Harry Potter and the Introduction to Wizardry'. There are too few good current children's films out there, and while Harry Potter emerges unscathed, a better 'magic' appears in the wonderful Pixar films, all of them, curiously, 90 minutes or under (compared to Potter's bloated 152 minutes)."

","Boy, there are a lot of CRITICS out there! I suppose everyone is entitled to an opinion. But I'd like to see the worst critics do better. I have not read the books and don't intend to. As a movie, Harry Potter is magical and enjoyable! Period. Faults and all. Only certain movies from my own childhood remained in my memory as fantastic as I only wished they were true! Willy Wonka, the Wizard of Oz, Close Encounters to name a few. I know my kids will regard Harry Potter in the same way.<br/><br/>I can't believe what people criticize about this movie. The score, the scenes, the acting, the plot, the buildings, the CGI. Do people realize that every one of these aspects could be perfect (if there is such a thing)and you could still end up with a lousy movie! In fact, this movie succeeds because everything works together so nicely. They achieved 'magic'.<br/><br/>

","Most everybody has seen or heard about this film by now, so I will only add a few comments to the pile. As an adult viewer, there are four obstacles to enjoying this movie: pace, believability, believability part 2, and the Harry Potter Drinking Game.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie was fairly slow. For a movie this long (152 min.), that's typically because they didn't edit it down to a manageable length. (The other excuse, that the story demanded it, doesn't apply here.) We watch as Harry is conveniently abandoned by Hagrid at the train station with a ticket for platform 9-3/4. This signals the start of another little puzzle that Harry must solve in order for him to go on. Of course Harry, the bright lad he is, figures it out. Unfortunately, this sequence doesn't add to the story, and neither do many others.<br/><br/>There are too many unbelievable/convenient elements in the story. Hermione just happens to know the spell to fix Harry's glasses. Ron just happens to do well at chess in time to win the Wizard's Chess Puzzle. Harry just happens to have special abilities he inherited from his mother which are only revealed when he battles Professor Quirrell. Harry just happens to accidentally make the winning play during his first Quidditch game. This goes on throughout the movie, turning most minds into cabbage jelly.<br/><br/>
The adults, as portrayed by the movie, are completely out of touch with the school and its students. Despite the faculty of Hogwarts having great experience with all kinds of tricks that budding wizards like to play, nobody says anything about Harry's very public cursed broom episode during the Quidditch game. As in many other episodes in the film, the adults either look down upon or ignore the students. Of note, this theme has been given wide treatment in many other teenage angst films, but without the benefit of being so unreal and heavy-handed.<br/><br/>Every time Harry is introduced to someone new, that person has to act surprised, intrigued, and in awe (it's in their contract). Harry's 'name recognition' scene was played approximately one thousand times too many. I quote from my still-burning memory cells: ""Potter? Harry Potter? _THE_ Harry Potter?"". By the middle of the film, I was cringing at the sight of any new character within shouting distance of Harry. Perhaps someone will revisit the Bob Newhart Show drinking game with the Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>Overly long, contrivances galore, and the Harry Potter Drinking Game were the only major faults I could stand to learn about. Other than that, watch till ya' drop."

Most of the parts of the book were in the movie, and the parts that were left out did not hurt the movie at all. For anyone who has not read the book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is basically about a boy, Harry, who discovers that he is a famous wizard goes to ""Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"" and has to figure out who is trying to get at a secret package in the school. In the end, Harry comes to literally come face to face with the evil wizard that killed his parents and gave him a scar on the forehead.

","I got into Harry Potter before all the hype.  A story about an ordinary boy who discovers he's an extraordinary wizard ...  I gotta get into that!  I decided to read the first book before the movie came out to formulate my own impressions - and I ended up reading all 4! Even though there was more in the book than the movie, most of the characters in the movie were exactly how I pictured them.  Hermione even *sounded* like I pictured her! I can't stand all the religious controversy. There is no evil ulterior motive. Harry and friends are good wizards fighting the evil Voldemort and his nasty cronies. It's about good versus evil and the good coming out on top. It teaches children to be good. When you see children dressed up for parties they're dressed as Harry and friends - not Voldemort! As a white witch myself, I practice magick in my daily life for good, peace, harmony and abundance, and to honour the Earth and the ancient ways.  I never use magick for evil, harm or to manipulate others. Although the magic in Harry Potter is make believe it is encouraging to note that people are realising that good magic is not evil. I have seen the movie and read the books over and over.  There are characters who the children can relate to and characters who the adults can relate to, like Professor Snape.  He is a very deep character who on the surface seems mean, but there's much more to him than that.  Alan Rickman plays Snape perfectly. How many people thought Snape was the evil one after the stone? Even I did at first, but I am rather proud of my deduction when I worked out it wasn't him. It's a pity there are no magical schools like Hogwarts! The Harry Potter series helps people realise that they are special, and believe in themselves and their own special magick even if they feel ordinary."

","So, another movie rushed on by. Sadly, even though it has a good concept and it adopts an original, good theme, rarely met on movies these days (because most of the movies these days promote violence one way or another), even though all this, this movie isn't so good understood by us, the watchers. If you don't understand a movie, how can you appreciate it? Thanks to the fact that I have read this book after which the movie was made, I understood the movie and this lead me to appreciate the movie by his high standards (good actors, original theme etc.). I'm glad however that the movie was very faithful to the book, because it is a good book indeed. Even though we all know that Harry Potter is actually the hero of a series of novels (children's books) the movie isn't so easy to be understand (it is not only a children's movie). That is why I highly recommend everyone to read the book before they see the movie (J.K. Rowling obviously knows her way with books and adventure, she's great!). Only understood, the movie can be truly enjoyed. It's a real pity if the movie isn't well understood. About the movie, what can I say? A little foggy, not too clear, that matters too, doesn't it? But for me, what matters most is not the picture itself (although this is very important, because that is what movies are all about), is the message that it is trying to promote and how it manages to do it. For start, I think that Daniel Radcliffe was very well picked because he looks just like the Harry Potter I imagined while reading the book. Rupert did too. And that was a pleasant surprise. The actors gave an impressive ""act"". I liked Richard Harris (Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (professor McGonagall), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid). Alan Rickman (professor Severus Snape), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) and of course, not to mention Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione), the undoubtedly known trio of the movie... The movie's story is very attractive. Harry, an ordinary, orphan boy was living a miserable life with his uncles. One day (more precisely, on his 11th birthday, which no one bothered to remind) he discovers that he isn't so ordinary after all. He finds out he is actually a well-known wizard who had very powerful wizards as his parents. When he find out the truth about his past, Harry is invited to join Hogwarts, a wizard school. There he makes friends a funny boy, Ron and a smart Muggle-born girl, Hermione. And with Ron and Hermione by his side, Harry faces great dangers send by the evil Lord Voldemort who killed his parents and is now after to kill him, in search of a powerful stone that bring immortality. Interesting story, isn't it? We can however easily see that all the ""action"" spins around Harry who is the main character. My favorite parts of the movie were the Quidditch match, the giant chess board game, the Zoo were Harry went with the Dursleys and the discussions between Harry and Dumbledore. All these scenes were made and designed thru Chris Columbus's ""wand"". He did remarkably well as a director. I appreciate the fact that he respected the book, not interfering with his personal stamp and ideas which would have certainly spoil the movie. It was a tense and a relaxing movie altogether, not to mention, funny! I found myself laughing all the way. This movie let us -the ordinary Muggles- to see our Muggle world as it is thru wizard's eyes. That gave me something to think about. The movie and the book turned me in a real Harry Potter fan. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a good movie basically because, with its popularity among people's movie preferences, shows us that everyone -age doesn't matter- absolutely everyone wants a little adventure in his life, a little adventure and. magic!"

","This rich adaptation of the first of J.K. Rowling's bestselling novels, about Harry Potter's adventures during his first year at Hogwarts, gets the budding franchise off to one hell of a start and myself finally into the thick of Pottermania after I watched the DVD and raced through all four books last summer. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) become so immersed in their roles, we have to remind ourselves that we're watching actors. The same goes for all the supporting characters, who are too numerous to mention here, because it's impossible to single out only a select few. There's not one bad performance to be seen. Complementing the players are solid direction by Chris Columbus, incredible sets by Stuart Craig and a powerful soundtrack by John Williams. When you think about it, has the man ever really composed a bad score? HP's only flaws are a long introduction and slow second-half pacing. Were it not for the awesome ""Tomb Raider,"" the boy wizard would have conjured up the best movie of 2001. Yes, you read that right.<br/><br/>The last thing I want to do here is get on my soapbox, but there is one issue regarding this movie that I need to get off my chest. While ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" may not have won any Oscars, it unfortunately does deserve the Complaining About the Color of the Couch Award. (Note the initials.) Never mind that HP earned nearly $1 billion worldwide and is the second-highest grossing film of all time (unfortunately playing second fiddle to the downright horrible ""Titanic""). I don't think I've ever heard so much anally-retentive griping before over one single movie. For instance, considering the universal disdain for tie-in merchandising, Columbus caught holy hell for staunchly rejecting any Harry Potter fast-food tie-ins - at Rowling's request, no less! - while Burger King got away unscathed with their ""Lord of the Rings"" promotion. Go figure.<br/><br/>
And to those who just can't enjoy this great work for what it is, and who instead choose to incessantly take apart every little detail, ranging from the acting and direction to the script's excessive - or dearth of - fidelity to the story and other pointless minutiae, try removing your head from your posterior and maybe you'll get a better view of things. These are the same clods who are so full of themselves that some feel the need to list book mistakes on their two-bit websites, as if they believe that doing so will elevate them to a special plateau. While we're on the subject of fidelity, what the hell does ""overfaithfulness"" to the story mean, anyway? 9/10"

","I've read the book, and I saw the film, and I thought it was good.  It wasn't perhaps as brilliant as the book had been, but for nearly three hours of something aimed at ten to fifteen year olds I thought it was spectacular. To keep kids entertained for that length of time, where the average movie is *half* that time, is no mean feat.  And to give me a permanent and unshakeable grin through the Quiddich match was a credit to the special effects, which while not absolutely realistic were convincing nonetheless.<br/><br/>To say that this film lacks the high definition and quality of, say, Lord of the Rings, is to compare a children's book to mature literature.  I do feel the main failing of the movie is that it simply has to cut a large amount of the nuances and feeling contained in the words and phrases of the book. This, however, is a failing of any adaption to cinema, and Lord of the Rings too suffers this criticism even from my own non-fanatical mouth.  To assume that a movie will be absolutely faithful to a book is to miss the whole point of imagination and most of the last thousand years of development in literature; so I can more than forgive Chris Columbus and Steven Kloves for this work.<br/><br/>So realistically this is an excellent story well worth watching in film. The special effects are not overdone, the characters are realistically child-like and the cast, with not a single USA accent to betray its backers and give the lie to its literary heritage, is superb.  Each actor, particularly Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman, give their characters as much personality as the book imbues them with.<br/><br/>Overall, very well done."

There have been countless takes on the idea throughout the ages, and this one, while arguably not classical literature, is a very delightful story in its own right.  The book is fun to read, for adults as well as kids, and the movie certainly follows suit. Young Harry, orphaned when he was only a toddler, is being cared for by his cruel Aunt and Uncle, and is forced to quietly tolerate the constant bullying of his cousin, Dudley.

With that simple discovery, Harry goes from being an ordinary young man in an ordinary world to an extraordinary young wizard in a world with no limits.<br/><br/>Sorcerer's (Philosopher's) Stone is the first in a series that seems to grow and mature in parallel with its title character.  In my opinion, this is not the best of the series, but it is absolutely enjoyable in its own right.<br/><br/>Magic and mysticism of all kinds permeate throughout the stories, but it is clear that the real magic at work here is at the tip of Rowling's pen.

","Although I have never read a page of a 'Harry Potter' novel, I looked forward to watching 'The Philosophers Stone'. I feel I have an advantage in that I do not know the complete Harry Potter story, making it quite new' to a viewer like me. This movie also shows me why Harry Potter is so popular with Children, as its story is directed right at that viewing audience. There is also an uncanny comparison to 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone'. Be captivated by the world's most popular mythical character, who has come to life! <br/><br/>In a world where wizards, witches and regular folk live in an uneasy co-existence, Harry Potter, a boy who learns on his eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and has special powers. When he is rescued from the abuse of his aunt, uncle and cousin, he is asked to attend the prestigious Hogwarts', school of Wizardry and Witchcraft. There, he meets two best friends, Ron and Hermione, who become his closest allies that have to help him discover the truth about his parents' mysterious deaths at the hands of a powerful adversary.<br/><br/>I was not sure what to expect when I came to watch the first Harry Potter movie, but after watching I was certainly glad that I did. Its stars are well chosen, whether it be the adult or child actors.  The main man of the show was Daniel Radcliffe, who landed the envious role of Harry Potter. I found him to be a perfect Harry Potter', and a remarkable resemblance to the character that has been written and drawn. Once Harry goes to Hogwarts School, he meets both Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), who become his closest friends. In fact their friendship is one of the highlights of the movie. Having such young actors in those most important performances was quite achievement.<br/><br/>The adult stars were also of the finest quality in Harry Potter. The star I recognised the most was Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). He was perfect for his role. He is deceptively good as Snape. Rickman is best remembered in the first Die Hard movie (1988). Harry's headmaster at Hogwarts is Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris). He is most respected at the school and has a long grey beard. Unfortunately Harris died a few months ago. Thankfully he finished his work on the second Harry Potter film. I liked Harry's adult friend Rubeus Hagrid, who saves him from his evil family. He is a funny guy, who helps Harry be the greatest magician he can be. Also look out for the funny cameo performance by John Cleese, who plays the humorous ghost Nearly Headless Nick'.<br/><br/>The Philosopher's Stone has some fine scenes and special effects attached to it. I enjoy how we see Harry start to discover the strange world he is about to be involved in. When he gets right into Hogwarts', he is participates in the popular and important sport called Quidditch. The game that we get to see being played out is an impressive special effect. Then you have the three-headed dog, Fluffy, who scares the three young magicians many times. It is a funny character, who is an impressive computer generated image. Yet the best scene for me would have to be the vital Chess game that the children have to play when they are on the search for the mystery behind Harry's parent's death. This also shows what impressive sets had to be designed for Harry Potter. The chess set must have taken along time to complete, but what an achievement it was to see.<br/><br/>Director Chris Columbus did a fine job with Harry Potter. I like the direction he took the audience on. It is also quite obvious that Columbus stuck very close to the unique Harry Potter story that has been written in the past, which is another positive for this film. This really is the perfect book to movie adaptation. The screenplay for the Philosopher's stone was written by Steve Klobe. While he had plenty of help by J.K. Rowling's herself, the story felt pretty accurate. The only problem I found with it was that it was a little childish' for my liking. But what can you expect from a story that is directed at children. <br/><br/>So with most of the world going Harry Potter' crazy, buying all-sorts of the wizards merchandise, clothes and now the movie, some people have warned me of the dangerous effects that such a story can have on the world's youngsters. Witchcraft can have a bad effect on anyone, yet by having it in the hands of a child, makes it all the worse. I fully understand why some people are very weary towards Harry Potter.  What is of great disappointment to me is the Harry Potter DVD, which was not released in widescreen and seemingly only directed at children. I wish it had an adult and a child section which were separate. I look forward to seeing what the next chapter of this story will be like, as I have heard nothing but praise for the Harry Potter sequel titled the chamber of secrets'. So I have big expectations when I do get around to seeing it.<br/><br/>CMRS give Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone': 4.5 (Very Good  Brilliant Film)"

","I have never read the Harry Potter books, a fact that appalls my daughter-in-law, who loves the novels.  I was not inclined to rush out to the movie theaters to catch this as I was much more interested in the Lord of the Rings movie.  One thing led to another and I finally caught it on HBO a year after its release.  I was very impressed with the film, although I still believe it to be meant for a younger audience.<br/><br/>The acting is all top-notch, not easy to do with adolescent actors, but the cast delivers well.  Many fine British adult actors appear; in fact, I'd say that absent Ian McKellen and Judi Dench, you have the best of the lot here, including the (now) late Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, John Hurt, and a cameo by one of my all-time favorites, John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick!  Robbie Coltrane is Harry's mentor of sorts, Hagrid, and he is so good I kept forgetting it was Robbie Coltrane.  Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson were marvelous as Harry and Hermione; as the series goes on and the characters grow up, I think they will be even better.<br/><br/>While the cinematography was superb, the script was a bit simplistic and obvious, but that's because it's aimed at young children, so it's completely forgivable.  The quidditch match is, I think, a great example of both the positives and the drawbacks.  I would expect future segments to be progressively darker and more complex, but the magic in this film is undeniable.  Now I think I'll go out and see the sequel at the cinema.  I give it an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>And by the way, to the stunning oafs that chortle with superior glee over the title change from Philosopher's Stone to Sorcerer's Stone for American release, you are all apparently too ignorant to know that (a) the book was titled ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" for its US release and the film was titled to match it, and (b) the word ""philosopher"" has no occult submeaning in American English, which would have made the title rather weak. We hear ""philosopher"" and think Socrates and Kant, not Merlin, and a ""philosopher's stone"" therefore sounds like either an engraved tablet or a Aristotelian kidney problem. Americans and Brits have different jargon. Get over it."

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fluffy, feel-good movie. It is not as good as the book, and it could have been better made. The fact is, it wasn't, and no amount of whining now will change that.<br/><br/>WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE:<br/><br/>1. The acting--once I got over the entirely British cast. (Not a slur! I'm American, it's just very, very unexpected for me to be seeing something like that. It was a great touch to the movie, overall, and I'm very glad J.K. Rowling insisted upon the decision.) Though the characters seemed watered-down from their book counterparts, the child actors seemed made for their roles, and I believe they did a superb job. The same goes for the adult cast, (sadly underused, a problem I hope is remedied by Movie Two, which I haven't yet seen, or in later installments).<br/><br/>2. Watching this movie made me feel like a little kid. It's very feel-good, and sometimes you just want a fluffy piece of whimsy to get your mind off how much real life sucks.<br/><br/>3. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape--Warner Brothers, please repeat after me: PERFECTION. The only reason I originally saw Sorcerer's Stone was to see Rickman in it, and likewise, he was the reason I shelled out nineteen dollars to buy the movie on VHS. Damn his voice is sexy; I melt everytime I listen to one of his lines.<br/><br/>Now that I'm starting to sound like a total freak, I just want to end this incoherency by saying: once you look past what Sorcerer's Stone could have been, it is truly a great film to watch. Unless, of course, like me, you get too distracted by Rickman to watch the rest of the movie."

","The film adaptation of J.K. Rowling's outstanding novel, ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" is a riveting, joyful adventure.  The cast is simply brilliant; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint all shine as the Hogwarts first-years ""Harry Potter,"" ""Hermione Granger,"" and ""Ron Weasley,"" respectively.  Another outstanding cast member is Dame Maggie Smith, who plays the strict but fair ""Professor McGonagall.""  Finally, Robbie Coltrane, as ""Hagrid,"" and Richard Harris, as ""Albus Dumbledore,"" are also great for their roles.<br/><br/>The special effects in the film are as outstanding as the cast.  The particular centerpiece of this film is the Quidditch match, which is brought to us in stunning detail.  The view of the Hogwarts School is also brilliantly done.  I especially liked the Gryffindor Common Room with its high ceilings and tall, narrow windows - just as you'd expect in a castle's tower.  <br/><br/>While there are a myriad of small changes and additions, the film surprisingly stays very close to the progression of the book.  The so-called ""lengthy"" run time of the film is nothing to worry about; with this particular movie, the more the better!  Besides, the film engrosses you too much and proceeds quickly enough as is.  It's doubtful that anyone will be watching the clock!"

"katc","Null","0","0","21 November 2002"," Very good but could it have been better?
","I'm in two minds about this film. I've never read the books so I can't really say if JK Rowling's vision was really realised or not and not being familiar with the character of Harry from the books I only have Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal to go on.<br/><br/>Having said that, I enjoyed this film for what it was, a very imaginative fantasy story. I think the credit for the movie can only go to Ms Rowling herself because I've heard she had a huge amount of involvement in the creation of Harry's world for the big screen.<br/><br/>I understand this is a very faithful adaptation but it's probably too faithful. There are parts of every book that can be left out in the translation to the big screen and Harry Potter is no exception. Where the editing of LOTR was superb and Peter Jackson and co. weren't afraid to change things around, I think the crew of Harry Potter could have learned a lot and been a little more daring. Fans aren't going to mind if you cut something out as long as their beloved story remains recognisable. Look at how well LOTR turned out.<br/><br/>As for the cast, they were top notch and I think that it's very commendable that there isn't one American amongst the cast. This, I hear, is due to Rowling's input.<br/><br/>There are those who say that Daniel Radcliffe wasn't as good a Harry as he might have been but obviously, if JK Rowling is happy to have him play her creation, he must be given some credit. I think all the kids were great and I'm sure we will see a lot more of them in years to come. May I also just pay a tribute to the late Richard Harris who will be sadly missed, the new Dumbledore will have a lot to do to match his portrayal.<br/><br/>One final comment. I severely object to the fact that the name of the film and the book was changed to suit US audiences. There is no such idea or concept as a ""sorcerer's"" stone. The word sorcerer does not mean the same thing as a philosopher. A philosopher translated from Greek is; a ""lover of knowledge"". This, I think, is not that difficult to grasp, it's not even that difficult to pronounce (fill-oss-offer) so why should US audiences not have to learn a new word? If you want more information read Paolo Coehlo's ""The Alchemist"" if you don't find it too difficult a read. It's about time we stopped dumbing down things to suit certain people. Need I say more?"

In fact all three of the young leads were very good (Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron.) They brought an appropriate zest and enthusiasm to their parts. At the other end of the age extreme, the veteran actor Richard Harris was completely believable as Professor Dumbledore. Then, of course, there was perhaps the most endearing character of all, the gentle giant groundskeeper Hagrid (played by Robbie Coltrane).<br/><br/>The movie is a wonderful tale, mixing in an almost ""Star Wars"" type fashion the ideas of light and dark; good and evil.

"neige","Null","0","0","15 November 2002"," Necessities of Adaptation
","The film is decent but has some failings. The primary one being that it follows the book too precisely. Alterations need to be made in order to convert a book to a screen adaptation; and due to fears of disappointing fans, these necessary changes were not made. The movie plods along at a turtle's pace. There is no speed up to move faster through slow sections, and a neglect of slowing down through the important sections. For example, an opening scene in which Harry Potter receives his letter to Hogwarts could have been shortened, without taking away from the film. Meanwhile his entire time spent at the school was run through, such that I never got a feeling for Harry's experience. Many comparisons have been made between Harry Potter and LOTR because the movies came out at the same time, and both are adaptations from well respected books. However, LOTR is an excellent example of how to edit the content in the process of conversion. Harry Potter demonstrates how to show a little bit of everything, without removing unnecessary bits and amplifying important moments. Therefore the film plodded through the story, as if performing a chore... Overall I would only recommend this movie if you live preoccupied with the notion that every decent film adaptation is actually blasphemy to the book."
"kmberger","8","0","0","17 November 2002"," A very faithful adaptation - perhaps too faithful.
","The Harry Potter books are only the single most popular children's stories in existence - most children under the age of thirteen (and a good chunk of adults as well) can recite the books verbatim. Drawing from fantasy literature and owing quite a debt to earlier writers such as Roald Dahl, J.K. Rowling made her stories about Harry the Wizard into a phenomenon. It's been a merchandising groundswell, a boon to children's literature, and a godsend to parents everywhere.  What could be better than having your child dive into a 300+ page book for hours on end?  Why, making those books into movies, of course.  No pressure.<br/><br/>The trickiest thing about adapting a book to a film is striking the balance between what works on paper and what works on screen.  Time is a natural restriction: a book has as long as it needs to describe the setting and the events and can delve into as much detail as the author deems necessary.  The reader can always put the book down and start up again another time, after all.  A movie, on the other hand, is a one-sitting event. Because of this, it needs to be more concerned about not overwhelming the viewer.  When transferring a book to the screen, things are usually streamlined, details (and sometimes characters) are omitted, and the end result is usually a reinvention of the original story.<br/><br/>'Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone' doesn't reinvent the book it's based on.  It copies it almost word for word to the screen.  Almost nothing is left out, virtually no event is ignored, and the result is a dense film that runs two-and-a-half hours and is virtually indistinguishable from the book. If you've read the book, you've seen the movie.  So the question is, was this the right decision?<br/><br/>It's a matter of taste, and the backlash on cutting anything from the original story probably would have been marketing suicide, but it definitely affects the film in terms of pacing.  While one of the beauties of reading a story like Harry Potter lies in unraveling the details of this new and strange world over the course of the school year, watching the same thing is a much different experience.  In an effort to show you as much as possible about the world Harry now lives in, it walks a very tight line between marvel and overload.  If it weren't the most popular book in the world, a tighter film probably would have been made.<br/><br/>That said, 'Sorceror's Stone' is still a beautiful film to watch.  The set design of Hogwart's School is breathtaking.  Every corner hides a little bit of magical (and computer-generated) trickery.  Most of the effects are seamlessly done, with a few minor exceptions (mostly involving wide-angles of flying broomsticks).  It's a bit overdone at times, with the swelling score by John Williams and the panning shots of the school and the main hall - but that's the point.  Hogwart's is a realm of magic and mystery, and is always presented as larger than life.<br/><br/>Casting is critical to a budding franchise like this one, and in general, 'Sorceror's Stone' gets it right.  The kids, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) drive the entire story, so they are key.  All are good choices and seem up for the roles, but Radcliffe and Watson don't quite seem comfortable just yet.  Grint, for his part as the lovable loser Ron Weasley, nearly steals the show every time he's on screen - he's got just the right balance of whimsy and mischief mixed with his humble down-home origins.  <br/><br/>For the adults, the best castings are Richard Harris as Dumbledore (just right in his wizened expertise, always with a sparkle in his eye that says he knows far more than anyone else does), Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid (the loyal lummox with a heart as big as he is), and best of all, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape (who utters every word, even the most benign, while oozing sinister menace.  He's delightful.).  Maggie Smith as Professor MacGonagall is also excellent, just as Maggie Smith always is.<br/><br/>This is first in a series, and as such involves a huge amount of exposition and explanation.  The entire film is consumed with who Harry is, why he's important, what's going on with all these wizards, and opening doors that will be explored in later episodes.  This means characters are introduced that don't do much of anything - yet. (Ginny Weasley and Nearly-Headless Nick, to name two.)  This means that the plot surrounding the Sorceror's Stone is necessarily thin.  This also means, that if the film (and book before it) has done its job, you'll be back for more when the next ones arrive.  On that note, 'Sorceror's Stone' succeeds wonderfully in bringing to life this delightful story of the boy who was a wizard and the remarkable world that invites him in."

","I had once started reading the book when I was in sixth grade, the beginning was pretty boring, so I couldn't go on. When I heard the movie was coming out, I went ahead and read the rest of it, I finished it about three weeks before the movie came out, and i must say, i was pleased, that I went ahead and read the four books. I went to see the movie about a week after it came out, and it was also very pleasing. I liked the fact that Chris Colombus directed, instead of Spielberg. All the characters were very well acted. The kids were all brilliant, especially Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, all the teachers were well portrayed, especially Snape, and they also did a great job with my favorite character from the book, Hagrid, played by Robbie Coltrane. The visual effects were well created. I think my favorite scene is the Quidditch game, I like all the shots they took from the air, and the scoring of the film was the best thing in the movie. Nevertheless, they missed out some parts of the book that were important. For example, Harry was pretty confident in calling Voldemort by his name, and in the book, he always says ""Vol, I mean, You-Know-Who"". Hermione also says Voldemort's name once, and according to the book, she was afraid of it as well. They also left out the whole story with Norbert, the dragon, and they do not show the reaction of the students for the 150 points that Harry and his friends lost. Apart from those little things left out, this was a very good movie, and I don't understand all of the bad publicity they're throwing to it. I'm looking forward to seeing The Chamber of secrets. 9/10."

This is probably one of the best children's films since Babe, so only a 6 years difference. So is it good? Well, it is over-rated but performances from Robbie Coltrane and even John Cleese, his first children's film role since The Wind in the Willows, makes the film enjoyable for me. And of course, Harry Potter himself, Daniel Raddcliffe, should become the next Macaulay Culkin as he is truly brilliant in his role.

","As many of us who read the book know, Harry Potter(the franchise) uses the age-old fashion of teaching kids lessons(bravery, friendship, trusting, snootiness, etc.) through a hero that has a power that many kids would love to have, but love more to follow the adventures of. Although some say that it teaches children witchcraft, more of us know that it's a way to hook children into reading beyond the expectations of schools(six year olds reading the 100-600+ page books in just weeks) and teach them lessons that may not be well taught in schools. By having Harry as a hero, kids love to act like him, but they're smart enough to know what's sensible and what's not. Harry Potter plays on that, so they can make children do the right thing for many, not just themselves.<br/><br/>The movie is a great representation of the book. While many critisise it for it's length, it was either that or not following the books at all. Many critisise it for taking the imagination out of reading. Well, I think children love to use their imagination much more than rely on something, though it serves well for children who are dislexic or whatnot and can't read the books or have trouble imagining what's happening. If parents are that upset, don't show it to them. The sets are fabulous, the cast is great and now can be shown so that no one can agree it could have gone better, and it's a classic good-versus-evil plot, if a little controversial with some people.<br/><br/>Like a great, famous, and classic nursery rhyme."

      The scenes in the Dursley's neighborhood, look very similar to the way English sitcoms look on public T.V. They are very dry and look almost bleached. The scenes at Hogwarts and Diagon Alley are filled with color, and are visually stunning. Not unlike the Wizard of OZ, which Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone can be easily compared to.         The performances are uniformly excellent. The actors in Harry Potter thoroughly establish their characters personalities. Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Robbie Coltrane, Sean Biggerstaff, and others are really impressive in their roles.<br/><br/>        Harry Potter includes some really elaborate art direction and sets. The first scene in Diagon Alley, you see a vibrant, bustling town, it matches the book.        Chris Columbus really deserves a lot of credit. His direction artful while being faithful to the book.         Without giving to much away the ending was brilliantly re-imagined, it was really fleshed out.

","pros: Costumes, score, directing, acting, script, special effects, cast.<br/><br/>Cons: None.<br/><br/>In a time where movies that generate unusually amounts of hype are usually the bad ones, Harry Potter not only exceeded my expectations, it shattered them. I was floored with this movie. Till this day why it didn't win any oscars or at least get nominated for best film I will never know. My only theory is that it was a British Film as the only main individual who was involved in it that wasn't british was Chris Columbus. plus Spielberg must have been hurting by the major diss. Most people I watch it with complain that it is too slow but that is the beauty of this film. It doesn't rush you into the world of Harry Potter but instead usually accompanies you, showing u wonders a little at a time much like the book. Other have said it is too faithful to the book. All I can say to them is that you haven't read the book. trust me folks a lot of stuff was aken out, particularly the beginning. What sets Harry Potter away from other films that year was the script and acting. Anytime I saw Radgliffe, Grinch, and Watson at screen together a smile came to my face.The elder all star cast was even better. For example as Hermoine would say, one of the classic scenes in this movie would be the troll scene. Professor quirell comes running in and shouts ""troll in the dungeon, thought u ought to know"" then he faints. Instead of an immediate reaction, about 2 seconds is given for the thought to reach the students, then they all start screaming, I always laugh at that scene everytime. ALthough lenghty sometimes, it has enough wonders to keep you through. Some of the effects are quite spectacular like Fluffy and the Quidditch match. That has to rate as one of my all time best cinematic moments. Was really excels in this movie is Chris Columbus directing. My God he was great. Perfect balance of action, suspense, mystery and he really helped the kids get their act together so to speak. The score was brilliant. From now on John Williams should be scoring every project in Hollywood rather than that once good-turned hack Elfman.It isn't a mystery why this movie became the second highest grossing movie of all time even thought it had a 21/2 hr running period. I can't seem to stop watching this movie and will probably watch it again right after I am done typing this review. Probably my second all time favourite movie next to Dick Tracy.<br/><br/>Premise: Harry, Hermoine and Ron have adventures in Hogwarts while Quirell tries to get the scorcerer's stone.<br/><br/>Harry Potter was nominated for numerous prestigious awards including three oscars but sadly won very few of them.<br/><br/>Grade:10/10 (As Roeper and Ebert put it, ""The wizard of Oz of its time""."
"nebbin","Null","0","0","28 September 2002"," Decent but could use some actual drama
","The following review may seem harsh. It is not the intention. Overall I think it's a decent movie, but all I really want to do is point out the one thing that really bothered me. So while I ramble about it a bit, don't think that I am really trying to slam the movie, it's just this one aspect of the film really bothers me. Otherwise it's a decent movie. Note: SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Okay, here goes. Harry Potter was pretty good. There were defenately some good things. Some clever bits like the wizards trading card where the wizard disappeared(can't expect him to hang around all day). I was also VERY pleased that they pulled a switch at the end and made the bad guy a good guy. In fact, I was hoping that that would be the case, but because of the film being a bit predictable, I wasn't sure if it would go the WYSIWYG route and make the bad guy the bad guy with no surprises deemed necessary. So things like that worked quite well and I was happy with.<br/><br/>
My main complaint was it seemed a bit too sugar coated for me- everything was a bit too easy. Potter seemed to have a few moments of tough times and then breeze through them, turning them to his advantage. Which can be okay- a hero making a bad situation good can be quite clever, and is the subject of much of the world's heroic characters, like Hercules of Greece, the American Coyote, Germany's Till Eulenspiegel, et al. <br/><br/>Everything had to turn out perfect and he never seemed to fail at anything, and the few times he did seem to fail- which would have been nice for character development and to teach kids that life can still be good even when you fail a few times- he ended up winning anyway.<br/><br/>
Potter has to win his first competition. I saw no reason why he couldn't have lost but been satisfied with the fact that he *was* the youngest player in his position ever, and he did quite well in that situation(and the fact that he was sabotoged might have made him feel a little better about losing). This would have worked in the vein of ""Hey, can't win 'em all."" But instead the movie isn't truly happy unless he succeeds in this game as in everything. <br/><br/>Similarly, there was a ceremony at the end where his particular dorm or whatever lost a year-long competition for best students. Boo hoo. So you lost a meaningless contest. I would have ended it with the heroes accepting that stuff happens, life goes on. After all, they foiled the machinations of one of the world's most powerful and feared sorcerers; defeated a troll, which is even a menace to potent wizards; among these triumphs, was a silly little contest that important? <br/><br/>But instead we get this feelgood happy ending where a last-minute update makes them win. Personally, I would have liked it more if the movie ended with a minor failure that is overshadowed by their earlier successes.<br/><br/>I know it's a kid's movie, but that doesn't mean it can't be intellectual. I direct you to Lloyd Alexander's ""Chronicles of Prydain"" books, a children's series that actually had the hero fail again and again and yet still accept at the end that he was a good person, and even gave up immortality to stay behind and help people rebuild- here kids learn that failure happens, get over it, and also learn the idea of sacrifice for the greater good. Yes, the hero Taran wants to be a mighty warrior, hoping to be discovered a prince. He never does, but accepts that his fate is not to be such(at the end of four books!). And finally he is offered eternal happiness in paradise and turns it down to instead help his war-torn nation rebuild. As a children's series, I find this much more intriguing(not to mention clever, intelligent, and moral) for both adults and children than having a hero who succeeds at everything he tries. I got to the point where I never worried about the hero because it was obvious he could never lose at anything.<br/><br/>
Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a BAD movie per se, it was fun and I am glad I saw it, but it really could have done with a little more 'risk' and 'humanity' in the hero. I suppose *** out of *****, which may be rounding up a bit, but it WAS fun."

Okay, it's a good movie on its own, the acting is good, the sets and special effects are superb, and the Quidditch seen was awesome, but they strayed so far from the book that I can't believe they dare to call it faithful. A few characters(Dean, Neville, etc.) had almost no screen time. The running gags of ""I shouldn't a told yeh that"" and Seamus blowing things up got boring immediately. They say they couldn't put some things in because it would be too long. I understand. But maybe if they didn't add so much excess crap, they could squeeze those crucial scenes in. Another thing, by the latter half of the movie, Hermione was turning into a complete idiot, quite unlike the book. They didn't even bother with the scene where she solves the Potions puzzle.

","I went into Harry Potter expecting the 'masterpiece' that everyone else claimed it was. I came out with extreme disappointment. Harry Potter has been over-commercialised, the movie is just an excuse to make toys and bad Harry Potter official magazines, lollies, documentaries, stickers, diaries, pencilcases, etc. The acting by the main character, Daniel Radcliffe, is particularly bad, and there is no expressions. The plot develops too quickly, and within 10 minutes of Harry being in a wizardry school he is already learned in most areas of magic. Everything is rushed in the movie, and things are DEFINATELY not faithful to the book.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Hermione and Professor Quirrel were the best actors, and everyone else sucked. The movie cut out important scenes regarding the development of the characters relationships, which made the movie particulary good for people 8 years and below. In fact, the only thing that made me see the movie again was the music. The music gave it a classic magical feel like the movie ""Witches"", but nothing else in the movie was worth it. They spent over $100 million more than Lord of the Rings on special effects, yet they are laughable, the blue screen behind Harry in the broomstick scene looks really bad, and the castle looks like they are acting in front of a cartoon drawing.<br/><br/>If you want my advice, read the book, don't see the movie, and spend your money watching Lord of the Rings, a ""REAL"" fantasy movie, not some 'wannabe' Scooby Doo detective fantasy movie."

In the TV I saw him shooting and looking down between shots. But he wasn't just looking down. He was reading ""Harry Potter"". When I was confronted with the opening of this movie, I wasn't really interested, thought it was too childish. But thenm there had to be a reason why the books appealed to children, adults, everyone. So when inevitably I saw this one, the result was an instant feeling of empathy towards it. I can only say that if they are trying to charm the viewer, if they are trying to involve him in the movie's sheer magic, they succeeded all the way. Now I understand why this one has so many fans. It is simply irresistible. It gives you something that you always search for when you go watch a movie - the power to be in another place for a few hours. And the movie delivers this and many more: all the production values are epic and magnificent, the John Williams score being a sort of conductor of all the emotions you experience when seeing this.

","The movie is very good and I enjoyed it very much, but I have to say that it is too loyal to the book. A movie is a work of art in its own way, and so is a book, but when one is based in the other, you must put some creativity to make sure it will be good. Changing Aunt Petunia's and Dudley's hair colour is not enough and I found that annoying rather than original.<br/><br/>However, I have to say that several things, being loyal, are perfect. The set decoration deserved an Oscar nomination at least. The way they presented Hogwarts was just as I had imagined it. Professor McGonagall was just, JUST as I have imagined her, and so does Hagrid and Hermione, and her attitude was perfect: Show-off, superior when talking to Ron, respectable, severe and very intelligent. <br/><br/>About the script I complain, for that stuff about it being too loyal, but I hope it'll get better when Rowling write the scripts by herself because she know the world of Harry Potter and only she, like Mario Puzo did with The Godfather, can really say how this things can be transformed from literal to visual. With the Sorcerer's Stone there's the problem that makes the hard to adapt the novel into a film: EVERYTHING that happens has to do something important, if not to the ending of that story, with the ending of the third book, that has a lot to do with the story of the fourth which is vital to the entire Saga. <br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that in the film, little lines you just passed by, including that moment when Harry talks to the snake, or Hagrid names some Sirius Black, have a lot to do with the second book, or with the third.<br/><br/>My favourite, and the favourite of us all around here, is the second novel, The Chamber of Secrets and I believe is the most literal, although I've only read it once and I believe that they will change some stuff or wont, because they have Rowling writing the dialogues. <br/><br/>Just the same, because of visual effects and typical childish things, typical of Chris Columbus, I give it an 18 out of 20. That's how we evaluate things around here. <br/><br/>And another thing. I've seen Y Tu Mamá Tambien, or Your Mother Also or And Your Mother Too or however it's called in English, of. I just can't help to understand the creator of that movie, good but pretty much like two hours of hard, HARD core porn, is going to direct the Prisoner of Azkaban.

"Acolyte-2","Null","0","0","19 August 2002"," Miserable adaptation of a great story
","The actors were flawless, and in some cases brilliant. There are no special effects that were underdone, or done poorly. The sets are perfect. One might quibble about the costuming, but that's a minor concern and only in some cases; for the most part everyone is dressed as one might expect. So what's my complaint?<br/><br/>This is obviously the product of a director and writers who did not feel they had a free hand to adapt this story to its medium. Everything that took up more than a few pages in the book seemed to rate at least a mention here, but very often having mentioned them they're dropped without a backward glance. Some events are portrayed that have no real bearing on the story as abridged, taking up footage that could have been used for better development of some of the minor characters. For reasons of space, most of the satire and humor is dropped entirely in favor of the occasional slapstick comic relief, such as the running gag about Seamus blowing himself up in the Charms class.<br/><br/>Where's Dumbledore's wit, his sparkle, and his eccentricity? He's deep and sagacious, which is to say he's a stock wizard with no characteristics that distinguish him from dozens of others, and is completely lacking in the weirdness that made him so charming in the book. Where's Neville Longbottom's character development? He goes from losing his toad to getting paralyzed by Hermione with nothing in between. Rather than being given such short shrift, he should have been dropped from this movie entirely and saved for those moments later on where he'll be indispensable. Why even bother to include Norbert if you're not going to do anything with that subplot? Here it serves the sole purpose of being the cause for detention in the Forbidden Forest, but with all the other illicit doings of Harry & Co. some other pretext for could have been found. Surely they could have at least hinted at other Quidditch matches than the one that was actually portrayed; as it is, it stands alone and has no bearing on anything else that happens. I suppose they had to show it as it becomes very important in the later books, but it would have been better to work it into the plot somehow. These are just examples; I could name many more instances where the adaptation was very poorly done.<br/><br/>But worst of all is there are times when this movie is boring. How Columbus managed *that* with the material at his disposal is pretty amazing. The only reason I can come up with for it is that he felt constrained, either by the author of the book or the fan community, to ensure that certain elements from the book appeared in the movie whether or not they made sense cinematically. He would have served the audience better with more boldness in departing from the book where necessary, instead of adhering to it where it made no sense to do so."

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was not a perfect film, but is probably the BEST family movie ever and a very entertaining movie all around. <br/><br/>When Chris Columbus decided to make this movie, there were extreme challenges and risks ahead of him. He would need to keep the movie faithful to the book, but would have to cut some stuff out. He would have to get a cast to that looked like the characters in the book since the characters are so vividly described. He had a lot of trouble trying to find the right kids and thousands auditioned. <br/><br/>What do we get for a cast? Well, we get Danielle Radcliffe as famous Harry Potter, Emma Watson as the know-it-all, Hermione Granger, and Rupert Grint as the red headed Ronald (Ron) Weasley, and Tom Felton as the enemy, Draco Malfoy. What do all four of these actors have in common? They are very unexperienced actors. Danielle Radcliffe had done Oliver Twist, Emma Watson hadn't done anything, Rupert Grint was once in a play, and Tom Felton hadn't done anything. The best out of them was Danielle. The worst was Emma Watson (which still, she did a good job). So the main actors that Chris got, he did an excellent job.<br/><br/>Yet, the background cast is so awesome. Consisting of critically acclaimed actors, Richard Harris as the 150+ year old Albus Dumbledore, Alan Rickman as the hook nosed, evil Professor Severus Snape, Maggie Smith as strict Professor Minerva McGonnogall, Monty Python's John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, Warwick Davies as the goblin in the bank and midget Professor Flitwick, and Robbie Coltrane as gentle giant, Rubeus Hagrid (Hagrid). Such an awesome cast to help the children actors.<br/><br/>Now, what does Chris do to the story? Well, it begins very good with Hagrid, Dumbledore, and McGonnagall dropping Harryoff at the Dursleys' and zooming forth a years to when Harry is 11. It begins good but they don't develop the characters too well. They add some things I didn't  like.<br/><br/>
Either way, it's a good movie."

","I really enjoyed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  The directing was very good.  Yet there were a few things missing.<br/><br/>First of all, I have to say the movie lacked feeling.  The kid's acting was horrible.  From Hermione's over exaggerating words, ""Ron, it's windgardeum leviOSa, not leviosa"", you get my point with the bad spelling!:)<br/><br/>Another thing...the movie lacked the feeling that the book gave, I honestly think that J.K.

","I don't see why everyone is giving ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" a hard time. Sure, it doesn't cover all the events from the book, but it wouldn't be possible to do that anyway given: a)the film is only 2-and-a-half hours long and b)some of the events of the book simply could not be translated onto film.<br/><br/>I received the DVD as a gift for my 21st (yes, 21st!) birthday. I hadn't read any of the books in the series and, I'll admit, had long been one of the skeptics of the whole Harry Potter phenomenon, regarding it as the latest craze kids were into. After watching the film I've now read all four of the books and have immensely enjoyed each of them.<br/><br/>Yes, the books are more informative and, in all honesty, more humorous than the film, and there are dedicated fans who will argue that adapting the books for film was a disaster waiting to happen. But let's enjoy the film for what it is - an entertaining way to pass a couple of hours. It's remained true to the book far more than many other adaptations and, in reality, this was a bit of a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation - there was always going to be people who wanted a strict adherence to the plot, others who didn't.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a film that is aimed at the adult and child market alike, much like the books I might add. I enjoyed this film, as a 21 year old graduate, as much as my 6 and 7 year old cousins did.<br/><br/>I'd probably give this film a rating of 9 out of 10, for a fun way to spend the afternoon. Let's hope the subsequent outings are as entertaining!"
"Moviefan2007","9","0","0","1 August 2002"," A Great Adaptation
","For being 2 and a half hours, this is the best they could have done.  Some of the minor characters and humor is cut down, but since it stuck to the main events, it is still great.  This is probably the best adaptation of a book that I have seen.  That does not mean that this movie is perfect though.  While much of the movie contains things that were in the book, there are things missing that I was looking forward to.  I know that they could not have put everything in here, but they could have made it just a teeny bit longer.  I was also disappointed by the special effects.  While all of them look spectacular, I was hoping that I wouldn't be able to tell that it was CGI they were using.  I was able to tell though.  That took away from the perfect 10 rating.  That aside, everything did look about right, from Diagon Alley to the Giant Chess Game.  This made for a great movie though, and I saw it a couple of more times in the theater, having enjoyed it so much.  I am highly awaiting the sequel, and from the trailer, it looks that it will even surpass this one.  I will always enjoy this movie, though, no matter how many times I see it, due to the fact that this is my favorite book series coming to life.  I gave it a 9/10 rating."

Snape was perfectly wicked, Hagrid lovingly dim, and Ron had wonderful facial expressions and comedic timing.<br/><br/>Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) was pretty good. He was very close to how I pictured him from the books. But Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) just annoyed the heck out of me. I had always pictured her being more enthusiastic than snotty. If I hadn't have read the book, I would have wondered just what the heck Ron and Harry were thinking when they befriended Hermione. She was, as Ron said, a ""nightmare"". In the book when, on the train, Ron attempts to turn his rat yellow but fails miserably and Hermione says ""Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've only tried a few myself..."" blah blah blah, but you get the gist, I'd pictured her being very out of breath and excited and enthusiastic and not at all intentionally snobby, but a bit just the same, and Watson came across as stuck-up as Draco Malfoy (who, by the way, was also excellently portrayed, if a bit of a small part.)<br/><br/>I'd give it a 8, just because Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane were AWESOME."

I found the settings and the backgrounds beautiful and inspiring, and these matched very well with my 'imagined world of Harry Potter'.

"Philby-3","Null","0","0","26 June 2002"," Delightful adaptation of wizard novel
","This was a pleasure to watch. Eager fresh faces, a galaxy of veteran British actors, sparkling photography, a sympathetic main character, a truly brilliant set piece (the Quiddich match), plenty of action, a pleasing combination of the real and the fantastic in set design and plenty of appropriate special effects. It was amusing to see the absurdly pompous ground floor of Australia House in London as the banking chamber of Gringott's Bank. I'm afraid to say the people behind the counter in real life are just as unsympathetic as the goblins of Gringott's. It must be the architecture.<br/><br/>It's always nice to see British acting veterans getting well-paid for once, though no doubt none of them will do as well out of this film as Alec Guinness did out of 'Star Wars'. Most of them give value for money here, even when, as in the case of Leslie Phillips, they appear as voice only, or, in the case of John Cleese, are allowed only a ghostly presence. Richard Harris is rather restrained as Headmaster Dumbledore but Maggie Smith gives us a suitably stern but kind Professor Mc Gonigall. Alan Rickman is splendidly twitchy as the suspect Professor Snape and the lesser-known Ian Hart is subtle and effective as Professor Quirrell, keeping his real role in the proceedings concealed until almost the end. I guess if David Warner had done the part we would have twigged right away. Robbie Coltrane is delightful as Hagrid. I was going to say 'unrecognisable', too, but his bulk does rather give him away. Hagrid has a fluid job description , but his role seems to be that of school porter and all-round friend to the pupils (the school caretaker is no friend to the pupils). Richard Griffiths as the awful Uncle Vernon reminds us that not all fat people are lovable.<br/><br/>The kids are also a delight, though one or two look like they have strayed off a Roald Dahl movie (Harry's cousin Dudley for example). The central three, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emily Watson), bounce well off each other, though I wonder what will happen when Harry's and Ron's hormones rise and they realise how drop-dead gorgeous Hermione is.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of the private school ethos, and boarding schools in particular, though I admit to consuming boarding school fiction many years ago. The charm here lies in the combination of artless fantasy with the institutional life of a school. I wonder about the social isolation of Hogwarts  all these bright young misfits in one place where they do not feel that they are freaks. There is also the exclusivity and the superiority surrounding their status as wizards, looking down their noses at us muggles. It's all a bit like medical or law school in fact  the arrogance generated is not always professionally advantageous.<br/><br/>Anyway, there are still lots of terms to go at Hogwart's and we can only hope they remain as fresh and as entertaining as this one."

","""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was exactly like the book. Daniel Radcliffe (who plays Harry Potter) is very good, and the film itself is a success. The story is about a boy who somehow was not killed with his parents by Voldemort (you can already tell by his name that he is the bad guy) he is picked up by wizards and then sent to live with his awful aunt, uncle, and cousin. When he is about to turn eleven, letters addressed to him start to come, and when his uncle destroys what he can of them, more and more come. When he turns eleven he is picked up again by a giant wizard by the name of Hagred and taken to Hogwarts: The School For Witchcraft and Wizardry. When he finds out that the intruder eleven years ago is closer than he ever expected, he goes through many horror-filled adventures. A good film, with a cast that match the characters, and a story which is very good, and very scary. I have read the first four that have come out and I am also very eager to read the last three when they come out. The 5th book comes out next summer, and if you have not read any of the books, read the first one, watch this movie, than read the other three, and wait patiently till next summer.<br/><br/>

For someone who has read the four books, I have to say that in the first time I saw the film I was very disappointed. I thought: ""Great story, great actors, great music, eveything to make a good film, and they did was this?"". I was disappointed because I thought that what it takes to love the book was not in the movie. Recently, I bought the tape and I saw it again, and again, and again. And my opinion changed. It's not as bad as I thought when I saw it the first time. The film tells the story in a great way, the actors are perfect and the music is fabulous. Also, the visual effects are spectacular (who can forget the quidditch game, the best scene in terms of special effects?).

By the time we move through the maze of Hogwart's gigantic cavernous structure (how many wizards are pupils here -- 25,000???) I forgot all about (and didn't care about) that silly red stone. Wonderfully talented cast (Rickman, especially, doing a dead-on imitation of Olivier's Richard III).  Pedestrian, paceless, unimaginative direction.  But when a film makes a billion dollars, that hardly matters.  Actually, the DVD extra features are more imaginative and fun than the film itself.

"FlickJunkie-2","9","0","0","21 June 2002"," Outstanding fantasy adventure film for kids
","This film is an outstanding fantasy adventure film for kids from about seven through fifteen.  After that, its appeal drops off dramatically.  Director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire) does a fine job of bringing the wildly popular children's series to the big screen.<br/><br/>Columbus had a difficult decision to make with the first film.  The introduction of Harry Potter requires a good deal of character and plot development, which isn't particularly interesting to those who aren't dedicated fans of the books.  Columbus chose to be true to the series and spent a lot of time doing background work that would be useful in later films (two more of which are already planned).  That encumbers this film a bit, weighing it down with details at the expense of plot pacing.  So, while this film is not as thrilling as it might have been, it sets the stage for more exciting sequels.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective the film is marvelous.  The visual effects in this film are often astounding, especially the Quidditch match.  The cinematography is rich and dramatic, both the outdoor shots and those shot on the sets.  Columbus entices excellent performances out of the young and inexperienced cast members, but also works well with the veterans.<br/><br/>The acting is fabulous.  Daniel Radcliffe is an excellent find as Harry.  He has a kind of nerdy coolness that is perfect for the part.  He comes across more as a regular kid trying to come to terms with special powers than a self important superhero type.  This is exactly the right balance.  Emma Watson, playing Hermione, is the consummate scene stealer and it is difficult to believe that this is her first feature film.  Watson packs a perky punch and has a wide array of facial expressions that often make dialogue completely superfluous.  Her self assurance and boldness provide the ideal contrast to Radcliffe's characterization of the timid and tentative Harry.<br/><br/>The adult actors also represent themselves admirably.  Richard Harris and Maggie Smith provide steadying influences as Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.  Harris is almost unidentifiable under the flowing beard and robes, but his distinctive voice is unmistakable.  Smith is suitably stern and kind, showing she has a soft spot for Harry, but maintaining the authoritarian demeanor required of her position.  But the show stealer among the older actors is clearly Robbie Coltrane as the overly loquacious Hagrid (`I shouldn't have said that.  I should NOT have said that.')  Coltrane makes Hagrid as lovable as he is bumbling; a kid in a grown-up's body that is clearly on the kids' side.<br/><br/>This is a delightful film for middle school kids, a segment that has fewer film choices than toddlers and teens.  I'd rate it a 9/10, shaving a point for excessive workup that slowed down the story a bit.  However, for Harry Potter fans, this is a perfect ten."

","I hadn't read any of the novels, so I wasn't that anxious to see the film, assuming it was just a kiddie flick and that I would be totally lost since I hadn't experienced the Harry Potter phenomenon. Well, on a whim I decided to rent the movie and give it a look, and boy was I surprised. It was great.<br/><br/>There's never a dull moment as Harry Potter travels to a mythical land to study magic at the Hogwarts school, where he meets a variety of colorful characters ranging from the funny Hagrid to the ""he's definitely up to something"" Prof. Snape. Every character in this film seems alive, thanks to a terrific cast of seasoned veterans and fresh newcomers. Daniel Radcliffe is a standout as Harry Potter. I doubt any other kid could have been as good as he was, and out of the (rumored) thousands of kids who auditioned, he was obviously the best of them all. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are good as his new friends, Ron and Hermione. The veterans of the cast include the always-reliable Richard Harris as Prof. Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Prof. McGonagall, a barely-noticeable Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, and Alan Rickman as the dubious Prof. Snape.<br/><br/>Though I've not (as I said) read any of the books, I can't compare them to the film, but it seems like director Chris Columbus went as far as he could go to literally bring the book itself alive. He seemed to go to great lengths to adapt as much of the Harry Potter world as possible. It's definitely an admirable effort, and I have to applaud him for making the film able to attract newcomers, such as myself. Not since STAR WARS has a movie made me feel so much like a kid again.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film moves nicely. At just about two hours and thirty minutes, it flies by like one hour. There are many standout scenes throughout the film, most notably the Quidditch sporting event (more exciting than the over-hyped pod race from THE PHANTOM MENACE) and the giant chess game battle near the end of the film. The cinematography is top-notch, the fantasy characters well-designed, and the score by John Williams ranks as one of his best of recent years, with a grand theme, beautiful epicness, and action-packed excitement.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the movie is a fun-filled adventure that both parents and kids can enjoy. Kids will like the action and special effects, and parents will feel like a kid again.<br/><br/>I wasn't a Harry Potter before, but I am now."

","Seeing this movie, I was sure that there was a glitch in the Matrix : How else could such a horrible movie earn such accolades, and global enthusiasm? It just defies explanation.<br/><br/>This movie didn't really make a lot of sense. Ignoring the giant holes in the plot (particularly in the journey for the stone), easily ignorable if you consider what this is, which is a movie for young children, the special effects simply were not good. My wife, normally a fanatical fantasy fan, said it best when she proclaimed that ""Clash of the Titans"" (1981) had better effects (along the lines of ""Jason and the Argonauts""), and truly I have to agree. Additionally, the acting of both Harry and Ron were horrible, with Hermione being the saving grace.<br/><br/>Children who're already enamored with the story of Harry will surely enjoy this movie, as will adults of the same ilk, however adults who haven't read the books, and hence haven't preconceptions or a bias, will very likely not like this movie, despite the claims that it crossed the age barrier: It does not."

","Spoilers<br/><br/>  The first of the Harry Potter books was the hardest to swallow but after this one, they just get enormously better.  I think the movie was great except for a few little things.  At times the dialogue is sort of unbelievable and flat.  Most of the children did a good job but Harry, Ron and Hermione seemed to hog the entire screen.  The rest of the children get only a few minutes worth of screen time.  Draco Malfoy was robbed.  In fact, everyone in the Slytherin house was cheated of screen time, especially the girls.  I'm not even going to start on the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff people. And does it make sense that Seamus Finnigan makes mistakes more often than Neville Longbottom is the movie?  How many time did that kid blow up his face and Neville only once had trouble while flying his broomstick? And what about the adults?  Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid had a good role but Professors McGonagall, Snape and Quirrel weren't given enough time to speak. McGonagall put up the best performance she could with what she had to work with.  More should have been done with Quirrel because he's only in one book so let's make his character count.  And Snape, who had a more prominent role in the books, gets to behave just as the rest of the Slytherins in the movie (Slytherin is basically just a house of nasty little pricks with wicked mommies and daddies). Good points: Quidditch is great fun to watch.  Argus Filch was hilarious. The scene at the end with Harry fighting Quirrel and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was really funny.  I can't wait for Chamber of Secrets because I know it is going to be a lot better.  I am anticipating the Valentine's Day celebration with Professor Lockhart, if that'll even be in there, and Lucius Malfoy. Slytherins all the way!"

","I have been an avid reader of Harry Potter since it first came out, before all the hype started. I thought the movie would actually be good. How wrong I was. Let's just face it: sometimes you just cannot make a film from books, especially great ones like Harry Potter. There are exceptions, e.g. The Lord of the Rings and Anne of Green Gables, but this didn't cut it. Draco Malfoy plays a prominent role in the book, and I have come to love him for it. But in here he is merely a background character, although the actor is very good. And there is a plot hole: Hagrid mentions that Snape protected the Stone. However, we do not encounter his enchantment, the potions. We only see Sprout's, Flitwick's, McGonagall's, and Quirrell's. From seeing a '1' on the spine of the Harry Potter video, I gather that there is an intent to make more Harry Potter films. If this film is anything to go by, don't see them. Stick to the books; you're allowed your own visions of the characters then. Rating: 4.5/10<br/><br/>P.S. Daniel Radcliffe cannot act. Emma Watson is mediocre. Rupert Grint, however, is superb."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and and I rate it up there with the all-time great ""kids"" movies. A wonderful blend of Cinderella and Wizard of Oz. I have it now on video and have seen it twice and it's great fun. I think perhaps I understand now why kids really gobbled this up. Just the simple fact that kids tore themselves away from the computer games and picked up a book, is an amazing feat in itself. But I salute J.K. Rowling for providing the youngsters with something highly entertaining and that promotes good, positive things for kids -- Loyalty, friendship, teamwork. Not evil and black magic. For all the individuals who claim that the  material in this film is corrupting the minds of youngsters -- need to have their heads examined. Chances are, several of these narrow minds didn't even see the film in the first place.<br/><br/>A brilliant cast. I'm so glad they chose to stick with a British cast. To attempt to ""Americanize"" it would have been a crime.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe was excellent as Harry -- unsure and a bit uncomfortable with his celebrity status but humble and very likable. A true hero for the kids. Harry's pal Ron played by Rupert Grint was absolute gold. He has the best lines and delivers them like a pro. Even after multiple viewings, I still bust out laughing at his scenes. Emma Watson plays her part to perfection. How many of us had a classmate like her when we went to school? C'mon raise your hands.(before she does and shows you up in front of the teacher)<br/><br/>A great supporting cast, and top rate visuals. Even on the small screen after seeing it on the big screen, it doesn't lose it's luster at all. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a wonderful piece of entertainment and I foresee it becoming a future classic."
"mrandy","9","0","0","4 June 2002"," Well cast, well acted, not so well scripted...
","Let me Start by saying that I broke my rule with movies made from books. I read the book first then saw the movie.  Big mistake in the case of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  Although the movie was (a well documented) 2 1/2 hours, the script spread the story very thin.<br/><br/>--Possible Spoilers--<br/><br/>I never enjoyed the first act of the novel (Harry living with his muggle relatives), so I was pleased that this portion of the story was condensed. But so much of the story was glossed over as well.  While reading the sorting hat scene, the tension can really be felt.  But in the movie, it seems more like an introduction to the four houses at Hogwart's.  There are several other points in the film that deal with the book's story similarly and disappointingly.  For example, in the movie we never sense how disappointed the house is with Harry, Ron, and Harmoine for losing 150 points for them -- in the book they are practically ostricized, which brings the trio closer together.<br/><br/>With a stronger, more focused script (DON'T read shorter --that's not what I am concerned about) this movie could have been great.  Instead we are given an entertaining tale that leaves you wanting for a fuller story.  The casting and cinematography in this movie are superb -- all the right people and all the right sets.  Radcliffe turns in a fine performance as Harry.<br/><br/>
As far as special effects, I was disappointed with all the ""money"" shots -- the troll, the three-headed dog, the centaur and Quidditch.  All seemed artificial, too easy to tell that they were CGI.  But I can't complain much about F/X, I liked the Mummy Returns, but the CGI at the end of that movie is some of the worst ever.  I digress.<br/><br/>Really, this movie was enjoyable.  A good yarn spread a bit thin in places, but nonetheless entertaining.  I give it a 7 out of 10."

","I truly missed this one when it came out in theatres,but now that it is out on videocassette and DVD,I finally got the chance to see last night for the very first time. However,since this was based on the popular best-selling children's books by J.K. Rowling this was a fantasy feature that has come to life. This lavish film version ends up working on both levels: as a stand-alone motion picture and as a worthy adaption of a novel that,while hardly a literary landmark,is nevertheless brilliantly funny,inventive and full of imaginary spunk. Director Chris Columbus has a deserved reputation for making cloying films(Home Alone,Mrs. Doubtfire and Bicentennial Man),but here he has deftly allowed the movie to carefully walked the precious line between being too syrupy for adults and too grave for children(there are some very scary scenes here that may be too intense for those under the age of 12 since the film carries a stern ""PG"" rating). In other words,this movie is way,way,COOL! Even though it was just a flick for the kiddies,it was spectacle beyond belief. Part Wizard of Oz,the flying sequence of both Steven Spielburg's E.T.,and part Return Of The Jedi,this was a must see. A grand technical achievement."

","My wife and I recently viewed this 2001 blockbuster on its just released DVD format and we were both favorably impressed.  Its length is ""just right"" but some other factors seemed a bit oddly compressed.  For all those who've read the series of books by J.K. Rowling and who are eager for her now overdue next installment, the movie is like an abridgment for the now-defunct ""Reader's Digest Condensed Books.""  The set-up of Muggles versus Wizards/Witches/Hogwarts blend of ghosts & supernatural-mythological creatures is highly evocatively rendered; the plot is faithfully gleaned from the original material without the subtlety of the book, especially in regard to the school environment.  I felt a bit shortchanged, however, in regard to any real mystery about the Stone itself that serves as Title Object.  According to the movie's action-driven plot, the top secret nature of the item is kind of a ""fraud"" since nothing is very well-disguised anyway.  Overall, this film is a pleasant Hollywood-version of a well-imagined parallel universe scenario.  High ratings for the special effects and engaging musical score.  The DVD is a bit too kid-oriented for my taste and I would have enjoyed some sort of ""Making of"" documentary."

"Metrocrash","Null","0","0","2 June 2002"," What could be wrong with this movie?
","At 24 years old, i am a self-described Harry Potter fanatic.  I easily outwitted just about all the people i played Harry Potter trivia with.  I love the books, I thouroughly enjoyed the movie! It captures the essence and story of the J.K. Rowlings first novel: Harry Potter and the Sourcer's Stone, aka...Philospher's stone, almost to the letter.   Daniel Radcliff (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) play the characters perfectly. They fit the images in my mind precisely as I had pictured them, although I must admit, perhaps I pictured them this way was becauase I saw a photograph of the three actors before reading the books.  Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), Richard Harris (Dumbledore), Alan Rickman (Snape), Maggie Smith (McGonagall), John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), etc all fit their roles perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie was funny and magical, just like it was in the book.  Dudley and the boa constrictor, the trio and Fluffy, and all the sights Harry saw in Diagon Alley.<br/><br/>However, what this movie lacked overall was warmth and soul.  Given that a 2.5 hour movie can only fit in so much, I was forgiving for this.  We never got good emotional aspects of the characters, but then again, the first novel never really got that emotional either.  For example, when Harry and the others lost all the points for their school house (Gryffindor), in the novel, Harry felt the ridicule and resentment quite clearly from his classmates, as their archenemies, the Slythrins took control of the standings.  Also, I am pleased to that WB and the writers did not try to change around the plot, as screenwriters commonly do when adapting novels (even children's books) to cinema.  LOTR's Fellowship of the Ring was another example of faithful film adaptation.  But when changes were made to HP...Stone, they were subtle and largely plot inconsequential, a few minor characters were omitted, Peeves, for one, while their presence was missed as they would have given color and texture, I understand why the writers chose to omit them, as their presence was not critical to the plot, which I must reiterate was extremely faithful and similar to the novel.  I believe Director Chirs Columbus had a diehard HP fan, his daughter!!!, looking over his shoulder, just to be sure!!!!  Ironically, Rowling herself, had relatively little sayso, (by her own choice!!!) over the direction of the film.  Many film critics were quick to decree that this movie may have been too faithful of the books.  I wholeheartedly disagree with them. With literally millions of fans out there, who know these novels back and fourth, the writers understood that significant changes would infuriate, and potentially lose ticket buyers<br/><br/>I also had a problem with the writers uses of animals names.  While the choregraphy and training was spectacular, the animals' personalities were a bit abrubt.  They  never verbally gave Harry's snowy owl her beloved name: Hedwig.  Nor for that matter, did they give the caretaker's cat...Mrs. Norris.  Yet, lesser animals were verbally addressed like Nevill's toad, Trevor, Hagrid's dog, Fang, and Ron's rat, Scabbers.<br/><br/>I must also critisize some of the special fx.  At times, particularly, the Quidditch match (which they're should have been at least one more), and the Troll, were overly digitized and/or too cartoonish.  Perhaps, Harry wrestelling a guy in a big troll suit and stilts would have been more fun. This movie was a learning process, and I am sure in subsequent movies, these problems will be rectified.<br/><br/>Some changes I must laud: The Quidditch stadium was a terrific alteration. Instead of a muggle looking football stadium as Rowling describes (albiet raised 50 feet high), the filmmakers, gave it a Roman gladitorial colliseum with a King Arthur jousting era look (The raised box towers for seating).<br/><br/>Overall this movie is one of a kind."

","Having not read any of the books, or previously seen the film at the cinema, the wonderous world of Harry Potter was a real revelation. For those that don't know Harry is an orphaned child destined, once removed from the horrible life forced on him by his aunt and uncle, to become a great wizard. But first he must get through Sorcery School. Director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs Doubtfire) hasn't gone overboard with his scene setting, but has used his imagination to great effect, bringing beautifully to life the scenes at Hogwarts School. At various times Columbus has delved into Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, Willow, Star Wars and even the Indiana Jones series of films for inspiration. Young shooting star Daniel Radcliffe fits the persona of Harry perfectly and seems to have an understanding of the importance of getting his role right. If Harry weren't perfect, the film would've been a disappointment for the many fans of JK Rowling's adventure. Even his young sidekicks, the wonderfully expressive Rupert Grint, as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson (a young Britney Spears lookalike), as Hermione Granger, are great. The best performances are reserved for the adults, in particular Robbie Coltrane, who plays Hagrid, and veteran Richard Harris, who stars as the revered Albus Dumbledore, while Alan Rickman as Professor Snape is, as usual, the perfect villain. It's easy to get lost in the world of Hogwarts where stairs change direction at the drop of the hat, ghosts walk through the halls and trolls spell trouble. The movie was a little long and many scenes could have been cut, but to do so may have rendered some damage to the fabric of Rowling's rich tale. What Harry Potter is, is a magnificent children's tale that also enraptures older audiences, leaving them spellbound as the story washes over them. While there's nothing particularly new about the direction of the movie and it certainly isn't flawless, it will remain a classic - even if it is only because Harry Potter popularised reading among young people again. Weekly rental tip: Willow (1998) starring Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley and Warwick Davis. A reluctant dwarf protects a special baby from an evil queen."

","Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a 10-year old British lad who has a zigzag scar on his forehead. He lives with his aunt and uncle and rotund, snotty cousin, who thoroughly despise him and make him live in a cupboard below a staircase. And all looks quite lost until the day Harry receives an invitation to attend the prestigious Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he's carried away by the giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).<br/><br/>Harry quickly learns that his mom and dad were a witch and wizard, respectively, and that they died while protecting him from the superevil Voldemort (also known as He Who Must Not Be Named); but Harry also learns that there's something about him that protects him from Voldemort. With his trusted new friends Ron and Hermione, Harry must find out what's in the trap door at Hogwarts that's guarded by a three-headed dog named Fluffy - and that certain bad guy or guys wants to get a hold of. <br/><br/>As serious as the plot seems, this is a most fanciful movie. It's quick paced, so as not to let the little kippers fall asleep, and is full of all of the dazzling effects you'd expect from a wizards and witches movie. It has quite a few things going for it (it did make a zillion dollars, so it must have something going for it), including a brisk, crisp script that's pretty close to the book, excellent performances from top to bottom, and those omnipresent effects that by now are fairly workaday to most of us.<br/><br/>
Author J. K. Rowling insisted that all of the cast - or at least those with speaking roles - be British, and as a result we get some of England's finest: Richard Harris (who's actually Irish), John Hurt, Maggie Smith, Ian Hunt, John Cleese, Richard Griffith, Julie Walters, Coltrane, and Alan Rickman. It's a magnificent roster, and each actor appears to be having a great time playing dress-up and spouting some downright hilarious lines.<br/><br/>This is a popcorn movie. Is it a date movie? Um, no. Your date might think you're an idiot if you sit down to watch this. But it IS a great movie to watch with your kids, and you might even get them to read the books. And hey, anything that gets kids to read something thicker than a pamphlet is usually a good thing. <br/><br/>Plus the special effects merely enhance the show; they aren't the show itself. The real star is the precocious Radcliffe (who's been signed to a few more Potter films, by the way) , who essays the young magician perfectly. Too often kids come off as snotty or impossibly cute in movies; Radcliffe is neither, and neither, by extension, is Harry Potter. I've seen too many films in which the kids are nothing more than glorified brats, even when they're the heroes - but not our fair Mr. Potter, who saves the day through his courage, wits, and intelligence. Oh yes, and love."

As well as being a mediocre film, Harry himself is but a shade of a character.<br/><br/>For a start, Harry never earns anything, or accomplishes on his own. Everything he achieves is gifted to him by someone's assistance.  Think of his so called 'feats'. [a] the defeat (albeit temporary) of Voldemort. He only achieves this through somely vaguely referred to 'gift of love' his mother sacrificed herself for.  His parents also left him a hell-load of money, an invisibility cloak and everything else he'd ever need to be a hero.  Even getting to the final confrontation required more action on his friends' behalf than he himself was involved in.  Ron, Hermione, McGonagall, Dumbledore, the Centaur and Hagrid constantly watch his back.  Plus, remember that Harry ends up getting the girl, Hermione, instead of Ron, who obviously deserves her.  What a rip off! <b> quidditch heroism. Think about it... he's naturally gifted at Quidditch through some genetic talent, and given a Nimbus 2000 broomstick.  How can the little b****** fail?  This scenario sounds like some bad American gridiron film.<br/><br/>And think of the pathetic enemies he has to face.  First Quirrell... a man who can be defeated by someone touching his face!  Not exactly a formidable foe.  Voldemort, who only exists as a face on the back of Quirrel's head. Last, and certinly least, is Draco Malfoy.  What a misnomer.  The name itself conjures up all sorts of epic fantasy hero connotations where the character himself is a pathetic nemesis of Harry, vastly inferior in every possible way.  His polished aristocratic appearance belies his lack of courage, negligible skills and integral personality flaws.<br/><br/>The road to heroism is supposed to be one of hardship, of sacrifice and redemption... it's not supposed to be a friggin' gravy train.<br/><br/>As a side note, the film also makes great assumptions on the audience's behalf.  When we're told that ""Nothing will happen while Dumpledore is [at Hogwarts]"", we're never told why, and these faults run constantly through the film.

Every time I read book IV I craved book V more.<br/><br/>I know that making these movies takes a lot of your time, not to mention supervising all the toys, spinoffs, video games and so forth.

(It took me a while to write this up.) The kids did have to run out into the corridor a couple of times during the high suspense parts, but that's sort of par for the course for them. They're sensitive.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that the movie was pretty true to the book, though there were some changes.<br/><br/>The most basic thing was that you might spend quite a bit of time reading a description of something, but when you see a picture it takes almost no time at all.  Therefore, when you see a new scene in the movie it seems quite a abrupt compared with the delightfully leisurely experience of reading the books.<br/><br/>** I'm not sure.  Is the following a spoiler? ** <br/><br/>There was one really disappointing thing for me. The book describes Voldemort as having a high, evil voice.  That was always a challenge for me when reading to the kids: thinking about what a high, evil voice would sound like.  I was hoping to hear a real actor attempt what I was trying to do when reading, but the Voldemort character in the movie has a low voice.  Too bad.  I will keep trying to read the books the way  they say they're supposed to be read, though.<br/><br/>Another challenge for me when reading was to try to figure out what Hagrid's speech was supposed to sound like.  He had some kind of strong accent in the books, but seeing as I'm not British I couldn't figure out what it was. Again, I was really looking forward to hearing what the accent would turn out to be when interpreted by a professional, but in the movie it sounded pretty bland.  Oh, well, I couldn't really keep up a British accent reading a whole book anyway, though I think my husband did when he was reading parts.  Maybe I should see the movie again and see whether I hear more of the accent.<br/><br/>In the movie, I was very intrigued by the face of the centaur, which was unusual.  I always thought of centaurs as having human faces, but this one was a face that had horsey type features.  Very creative, but his animation was disappointing.  Just as in Episode I of Star Wars, the CG characters sometimes jerk too fast and disappear, so I felt frustrated trying to see them clearly.  Now that I've seen Episode II of Star Wars, I know it can be better, so I hope it will be for the second Harry Potter movie, too.<br/><br/>In the books, Hermione's hair was described derogatorily.  I feel especially insulted when I see this gorgeous little girl and her beautiful hair, with so much body.  I have curly hair myself.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH CURLY/WAVY HAIR?!!  She looks great.  Another thing about Hermione: it is an important part of book IV that Hermione was supposed to have crooked teeth.  This girl's teeth look fine.  What are they going to do about that, when the plot demands it?  She'll suddenly get reverse orthodontia? <br/><br/>
Another problem with the movie was Snape.  In the book, he seems sinister and hateful.  In the movie, he does not seem so, a bit tight-a---d, perhaps, but not at all threatening.  <br/><br/>Anyway, despite all that, we were glad we saw it.  The castle was suitably impressive.   Harry was portrayed very nicely.  The classes, dormitory spaces, and the Dursley's house all looked perfect. The Slytherins were very well done indeed.   The Slytherin Quidditch team did look appropriately evil, sinister, and threatening, even though Snape did not.  The pace moved along nicely."

","Only 2 spoilers ahead but they only have to deal with Harry's personality, not any major plot point of the movie.....<br/><br/>I would like to make comment to all of those who feel that Daniel Radcliff did not make a good Harry.  First of all I would like to point out that the way they made him look in the movie he is a dead ringer for every picture of Harry I've seen drawn.  In fact, having never read the books at the time I saw the first commercial, and having not gotten far enough into the commercial for them to identify the name of the movie, as soon as I saw him (in a shot with no scar) I was like wow, he looks like that Potter kid drawings.  When I saw the title I said ""Oh, well that explains why he looked so much like him.""<br/><br/>I then saw the movie again before having read any of the books and thought based on the very short introduction involving the Dursleys, that Harry SHOULD be the quiet fairly unemotional type, after all he has obviously not had a very eventful social life, and he lives in a closet.  His aunt, uncle and cousin obviously hate him and are incredibly selfish pigs.  Had I lived in that kind of environment I figure I would learn to block out my emotions too.  I then read all 4 books in a matter of a week and determined that is EXACTLY how he was supposed to be presented.  Harry is an emotional wreck, when Hagrid first told him he was a wizard he thought there must be some mistake, there was nothing special about Harry in his mind, indeed if anything he was nothing more then a slave boy, certainly not someone with any sort of power whatsoever.  Harry has lived 10 painful years with the Dursleys,  he hides his emotions well, by becoming cold and distant.  It is exactly how Rowling presented him to be and it's exactly how Radcliff acted as him.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with all 3 as after reading the books and rereading book 1 to my niece, I feel they nailed their characters exactly.  I look forward to the Chamber of Secrets with almost as much anticipation as I do for book 5 to be released."

","Watching this movie was a mixed experience for me.  Having read the books, it was interesting to see how the film-makers realized the world of Harry Potter according to their own interpretations, and it was fun comparing these with my own.  There were things I liked, and disliked, and I'm just gonna tackle the major ones.<br/><br/>For the most part, the film remains faithful to the book.  But I believe that maybe it was too faithful.  A lot of the time I felt like I was watching a mish-mash of sequences from the book (in..er...sequence), just acted out.  That's perhaps my biggest gripe, that and the story seemed to lack and fluidity or flow.  It's like the film-makers said ""Hey, everyone who's gonna see this has read the book anyway, who cares about character development or the story?  Let's just knock em out with lots of eye-candy"". <br/><br/>Granted, I'm willing to wager that a huge majority of the audience has read the books, but I think the film-makers relied on this aspect way too much. Our knowledge of the characters, their relationships and everything else was taken as a given.  <br/><br/>My second gripe was with the three main actors.  You know, I've never really known what you could define as a 'chemistry' between actors, but I think I do now.  The three who played Ron, Harry and Hermione had none.  Nada.  Zip. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) seemed to lack severely in the enthusiasm department.  Where did they find this kid?  The other two actors (for Hermione and Ron) weren't nearly as bad, but I just couldn't imagine the three personalities we were presented with on screen, as being friends. <br/><br/>
What I liked about the film...?  Well the production values were stupidly high, and this is evident in just about every single scene (I'm not complaining!).  It's 150 minutes of pure eye-candy.  That's probably the only redeeming feature of the film, but we all know that this doth not maketh a good movie.  I may sound a little sour about the whole experience (and like one severely disappointed, frothing-at-the-mouth, psychotic Harry Potter fan...seriously, I'm not), but it wasn't completely terrible.  Maybe they'll do something about the cut-n-paste recipe for the next film, and the three child actors will mature a little more...and stuff.  We'll see!"

But I felt they grossly undermined just how bad the Dursleys were to Harry.  Their hatred wasn't really felt,and I think they could have established that better.  In the book, there is a specific moment when there are apologies all around among Ron, Hermione, & Harry and the boys become friends with her.  They failed to resolve Hagrid's dragon problem and made no mention of the properties of each house(except, Slytherin, of course--'all the great ones come from Slytherin!"").  Not to mention all the wands Harry went through before he finally found his, and the potions trial in the dungeon as they're getting the Sorceror's stone(proving logic has merit, too.  That scene would also explain Dumbledore's comment about Hermione remaining cool under pressure-it's a nice pun, as they have to pass through fire). But like I said, you can't include everything!  The dialogue was right out of the book and the FX were nice, if a little obvious in places(btw, they could learn something from ""Hercules"" about making centaurs).  All in all, a good movie and a nice lesson about how sometimes, underdogs are destined for great things!"

I agree, there were parts from the book that were left out or changed, but other than that very good. I loved the part where Harry was hanging off his broomstick with only one hand. Don't ask me why, just 'cause. Also he looks so determined to get Neville's Remembrall back from Malfoy. You can see it in his face! I found the Voldemort scene very intense. I mean, how many 11-year-old kids would be able to stand up to someone like Voldemort/Professor Quirrel. And did you notice how when Quirrel comes into the Great Hall to tell Proffessor Dumbledore that there's a ""Troll in the dungeon"", that he doesn't stutter?!?! I found that quite weird and a bit foreshadowing!"

","Put it this way, if you loved the book, chances are you're going to like this.  If you hated the book, or worse didn't read it at all, then you're going to find this film pretty bemusing.<br/><br/>The reason for this is that it doesn't really stand up well as a film in its own right.  That it manages to faithfully recreate most of the key moments in the book at all is something of a miracle, given the subject matter. The trouble is that what works well in print does not always make interesting viewing in a movie.  I think, those that already knew the book enjoyed the film simply because of this faithful recreation, and not because the film in itself had any artistic merit.  Thus, those who have not read the books are both at an advantage in being able to criticise the film objectively, but at a disadvantage because they got no enjoyment out of it.<br/><br/>I also think that there was an unquestionable Englishness to the whole film (English actors, English public school setting etc.), which may really grate with some people.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed it, but I'm prepared to admit that I am wholly biased by my enjoyment of the first four Harry Potter books.  And I did rather find myself mentally noting the various scenes as they appeared and comparing them with the book.<br/><br/>One thing I don't understand - the original book was called ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" and so was the movie in the UK.  Why was the title changed to ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" in the USA? Surely dumbing down the title of a children's novel is something of an insult to American childrens' intelligence?  Will Americans really not go and see a film if the title doesn't give some clue as to the film's content?  Why would this be?"

","Oh. Yeh. OK. I've read the books 2 or 3 times the way through and have all of them. I've seen the film 3 times [little bruv has it on video] and I STILL think it's just a bad film. I'm sorry to all you fans of this but i would only give this film 3-4 stars. And those are for the special effects. Yes, the special effects are great! I loved the Quidditch Match where the people are flying around [except when D. Radcliffe appears again] and the CGI was brill.<br/><br/>But the acting was a TOTAL let-down. I have said I've read all the books 2 or 3 times and Harry was TERRIBLE! He's supposed to be laid back and easy-going but Radcliffe isn't. Sorry Daniel if your reading this. He is as stiff as a pole and as soon as it's Christmas and Harry runs out in his pyjamas and round glasses (OBVIOUSLY commercialised, in the books Harry doesn't have round specs and the (cr@p) toy manufacturers have now started to refer to them as 'trademark specs', probably because they are easy to make in plastic) he says 'Happy Christmas Ron' and my mind drifted to some B-Movie romantic where they're just gonna leap on each other and kiss or summit. Daniel was so subdued in it all the time he wasn't convincible, and when he says 'I... didn't know' about his dad playing Quidditch I thought OMG. In the books and a PROPER film he would have said 'I didn't know!', stating the fact instead of being unconvincibly shocked. Please. He spoke his words so posh and pronunciated (he's from LONDON goddammit!) that he wasn't laid-back and easy-going AT ALL!<br/><br/>To the other characters! Ron and Hermione were mostly great, but Ron is a bit too amazed sometimes, especially by the Invisibility Cloak, and Hermione speaks just too posh sometimes as well. They all have a knack for stating the obvious, 'I think the troll escaped the dungeon' (never, it's just walking infront of you). Harry does it a lot, mostly. Malfoy is just weird, he's not quite right... The adults were brill though, with the exception of Snape who seems quite nice actually and his sarcasm doesn't work, when he refers to Harry as 'our new celebrity' then I just burst out laughing. Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) was by far the best actor in the film, with Dumbledorwe and Mcgonagal close behind.<br/><br/>So I would like to say that if you have never read the books by all means go see it but if you have you will be DEEPLY dissapointed.<br/><br/>And they never name Harry's owl, Hedwig."

"Aragorn22","9","0","0","18 May 2002"," Great for people who have been reading the book
","The books about Potter are absolutely great. So, this movie begins with an extreme advantage: a great plot is already written. The disadvantage is that these books are very popular and thereby everyone would compare the movie with the book. To make everyone happy is an almost impossible task and I would say this movie didn´t achieve in that, but.....they get really close. Many plots, characters and little things out of the book are there. The only thing is, that they couldn´t work out all the characters at a deep level. Thereby, you sometimes miss things on the screen you did read. On top of that, I really missed ""Peeves""; the bully poltergeist. But, John Cleese as ""Sir. Nearly Headless Nick"" was very funny. For me, one of the best parts was the Quidditch game. They really made it look great. Also, the surroundings are great: you really see Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Privet Drive and Gringots. Especially Gringots, the bank which is run by Goblins looks brilliant. For people who have been reading the first book, watching this movie is a wonderful experience; you see everything come to life. And, at the end of the day, they did really stay close to the book, not changing much. For people who didn´t read it, I think, the movie isn´t really good. I strongly advise to those people to first read the book and watch the movie after that. For me, watching it was a pretty intense experience: I really loved all the books and have much sympathy witch Harry and his friends (and enemies). The actors performances aren´t outstanding, but not bad also. The special effects were sometimes pretty good, sometimes at a medium quality, but also sometimes just not good enough. I mean, don´t expect a quality like Lord of the Rings (LOTR). Last, comparing the Potter movie to LOTR, I dare to say that  LOTR wins every imaginable contest with the Potter movie. But, LOTR is something so special, so perfect and brilliant, that every movie loses it to Frodo and his friends. So, in sum, Potter isn´t by far in the same league as LOTR, but it still is a pretty great movie to watch. I´m already waiting for The Chamber of Secrets...."

It seems that every single time it is done, we as an audience bitch about it, even if we sit around discussing ""wouldn't it be cool if they...."" about our favorite books.  And when Hollywood steps up and does just that, we claim to hate it solely because it doesn't fit with our vision of the book.<br/><br/>BIG DEAL!!<br/><br/>Folks, understand two things;<br/><br/>1) when a movie is made from a book, some things have to change as a result, because what works in a book doesn't always happen to work in a film, because...<br/><br/>2) we as a movie watching society can hardly stand to watch anything that it longer than 1hr 45min in a theater....it tries our patience for some reason. And so Hollywood must try to condense subject matter as much as possible, and still tell the same story.<br/><br/>And once in a while, they pull it off, just as they did with Harry Potter. Now, I hadn't read the books when I watched the movie for the first time, and I thought the movie was great!  It sparked my interest in the books, and have now read all four of them. The movie did not butcher the book at all...all the major events are there, as well as plot points and characterizations.  Alan Rickman was a great Snape, mostly because he does a great job of being creepy.  Maggie Smith was also perfect, because she always played great authoritative roles like this one, and the casting for the children in the movie was perfect as well.  The scenery was beautiful, and it kept my interest all the way through.<br/><br/>I believe that the complaints listed around this movie are only there because people need something to complain about in any given way, especially about their entertainment.  Listed below is a person who quoted the book in the descriptions of the children, and how the actors did not look like how the book describes them.  They were actually perfect casting, and after re-reading the book descriptors, there really isn't much difference, so I put that down to nit-picking about details that really weren't that important.  Who cares if in the film Hermione doesn't have BIG teeth. Go for the quality of her acting, not the size of her incisors.<br/><br/>If you don't nit-pick it to death, accuse it of being stereotypical, or cry out that it is a bastardization of the book, you'll look at it and see that it really is a good movie.

I know many avid harry potter fans, and they can't seem to put a finger on why they didn't like it, they just didn't!  This film is almost completely made up of scenes stripped from the book, which makes it even more irksome when certain minor things are left out.  It almost seems that this movie has no soul of its own, and manages to botch things at times: the awkward position of harry's scar, the way hermione looks, Professor Magonagoll's age, Harry's well kept and less than unruly hair, et cetera. Since everything is stripped from the book, the movie can barely afford to stray at all, making it irritating for fans to watch when something minor like that is changed.<br/><br/>People who haven't read the books, however, are sure to have a peachy time of it.<br/><br/>There are redeeming qualities to the film.  The score, while extremely redundant and innapropriately ""magical"" at times, is still a very good one. Coltraine is a great Hagrid, the same giant in the book whom you just want to run up to and give a hug.  Some fans have qualms with Maggie Smith for being too old to play professor magonagoll; I personally think she does a great job.  Dumbledore is very endearing, even though his very long beard looks like the fake spiderweb you buy for your house during halloween at the ends.  And of course, you just want to bash in the pretentious little nose of Draco Malfoy.  Macaully Culkin would have been a good Draco, I think.<br/><br/>But that's just me.

She played Susan Bones, but SUSAN BONES DIDN'T HAVE ANY LINES OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY EXCEPT THE FACT THAT SHE WAS SORTED INTO HUFFLEPUFF!

Its an addicting book, and I can't wait until the next books comes out.<br/><br/>   I admit I was nervous to go and see the movie. I was afraid that it would be totally different from the book..and the thought of it just being horrible crept in my mind.Being a huge fan of this book, I really wanted the movie to resemble the book as much as possible. And thats exactly what it did. Chris Columbus did a wonderful job at directing the movie (as he has done in ""Home Alone"" and the second ""Home Alone"" also). And I love the fact that it shows how much time he took to make the movie like the book. He did a great job at directing! Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have done absolutely wonderful at acting in this movie. The costumes and Diagon Alley were exactly the way I pictured it to be. The Dursleys home, Hogwarts school, the train station. Every little detail was exactly the way the author (J.K. Rowling) had described it.    The cinematography was wonderful. The characters were what I pictured them too be. This turned out to be a huge success. I absolutely loved this movie, and it made me love the whole Harry Potter story even more.<br/><br/>   John Williams did great in making the music for the movie because I think that it fit perfectly. I remember listening to the soundtrack cd and thinking of the books and I realized that the music was so magical and perfect for this movie and the book. Everything for this movie was just perfect.

","I've never read the ""Harry Potter"" books, but I can say that I'm quite pleased with the movie. It's not every day that you could find a bunch of children who would actually act. In ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" the children are not only likeable, but they also blend in well with the story.<br/><br/>Originally to be directed by Steven Spielberg, and starring Haley Joel Osment as the title character, ""Harry Potter"" was helmed by Chris Columbus, a director experienced with working with children. His direction is fine. He gives the story appeal to both adults and children, which is not that common in today's movies. It has some psychological moments, as well as brilliant art direction. Having not read the books, I can already say that ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a wonderful adaptation to J.K. Rowlings' first book of the ""Harry Potter"" series.<br/><br/>And the film does have some state-of-the-art special effects, over 700 shots. However, some of them suffer from having a sharp-looking foreground, while the background is rather blurry. Many of the special effects scream to the audience revealing that they are indeed special effects. Yet most of this doesn't distract us from the story, which is another uncommon thing for today's movies.<br/><br/>We also have some cool magic tricks along with some exciting and suspenseful action sequences, such as Quidditch, a wizard's sport, and a game of Chess played by living humans. We have fun exploring the campus of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as characters go up on moving staircases and meeting the three-headed dog, Fluffy. And there are also some funny and heartwarming moments such as a newborn dragon breathing fire, singeing one of the characters' giant beard.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter"" is an enjoyable film for the whole family, which I'd recommend out to people who don't read the books or aren't interested in magic tricks. This is all because of Chris Columbus' clever direction that makes kids feel like adults and adults feel like kids."

Perhaps the weakest of the lot are Fred and George Weasley, but only in comparison to the rest. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, McGonagall and especially Hagrid are all a treat to watch and they make the movie a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The effects are also well-done even though I would have liked to see more Quidditch than was shown.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie enough ...<br/><br/>10/10"

This leads me to my biggest qualm with the movie:  Minor characters were VERY minor. As in we hardly ever saw people like the twins or Nevile ect.  Secondly, the movie had scenes that did not mesh or flow and a lot of crucial scenes were left out.  As a result, the movie didn't even give off the same feeling as the book.

","I must admit that I was completely baffled by the whole Harry Potter craze that has been stirring for several years now.  I primarily viewed these books as for teenagers and thought it was strange that so many adults had started reading them too.  It seemed to me that the whole witches and wizards at school things had already been done to death, especially in the UK.  When the movie came out, I really had no desire to see it.<br/><br/>Last week, I finally decided to rent the movie and just watch it since so many people thought I was nuts for not having seen it sooner.  To my utter astonishment, I actually liked it.  The visuals are fantastic, the acting is top notch, and the music, well, how can you go wrong with John Williams. Daniel Radcliffe shines as the at first downtrodden, but spirited and ever helpful Harry Potter.<br/><br/>I did not find this movie disjointed or as some have claimed, wandering about going from story to story.  There are three main story lines and I followed them clearly throughout the movie.  It makes me wonder if some of the people writing these reviews every went to college.  College is a sequence of going to class, walking the halls, going to watch games, sleeping, etc.  If you have trouble following the scenes, I suggest you watch again and pay closer attention.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I hope to see the future films at the theater.  I would also like to see Mr. Radcliffe in more roles and just hope he can escape being typecast as Harry Potter."

","I went into this movie having had the opportunity of listening to the soundtrack first.  It was rather interesting to see if my expectations would be met.  Afterall, when you listen to the music first it gives a bit of an insight to what the movie truly is about.<br/><br/>Well, I am happy to say that my expectations were met to the ""T"".<br/><br/>So, what were my expectations?  Having read the titles to the tracks themselves revealed much of the story.  I was disappointed by the fact the soundtrack gave away much of the surprise.  Nevertheless, this is about the movie and not the soundtrack.  What I expected was a quasi-story line with little plot.  In fact the scenes were a bit disjointed with little or no relevance from one to the next.  I felt it dragged quite a bit in the middle, but an attempt was being made to develop the characters. Nevertheless, it could have been done better.<br/><br/>A major part of the movie were the effects and given that it was 2001 when the movie was released I figured the effects would have been outstanding. Contrary to my thought though, the effects were extremely low-budget.  We will look back on this movie in a few years time and think, ""God, what was the studio thinking?"" and then flip the ""Lord of the Rings"" DVD into the tray.  Somehow, we were supposed to be made to believe that the outside environment was real and that there was not blue/green screen behind the actors.  Especially during the match, it was painfully obvious that the actors were making an effort to make us believe they were flying even though the effects were bad.<br/><br/>**SPOILER WARNING**<br/><br/>I don't know but does every movie have to end with the good guy beating the pulp out of the bad guy?  In this case laying of hands...gosh, I guess they figured the kids wouldn't appreciate blood soaking the walls as they duked it out for supremacy.<br/><br/>**SPOILER END**<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was a second-rate bore with little to appreciate and lots to squirm in your chair about.

","(Note: This review has some mini-spoilers in it.)<br/><br/>I must say, I was quite impressed by the filmmakers' ability to but the book on film.<br/><br/>However, I would recommend that one read the book before watching the movie. Though the movie stands nicely by itself, it seemed to me to be a bit more of a treat for those who had already read the books.  At some points, the movie can become a bit disillusioning and/or can veer off into MST3K-able territory (e.g., the beginning of the movie).<br/><br/>Another reason that I would recommend the book before the movie is that the viewer can lose or not grasp the sense of time in the movie.  For example, it was a bit of a stretch for me to leap from a couple weeks into the school year at Hogwarts to Christmastime.  Compared to this, the book effectively uses time to 1) actually give the audience a sense of the passing time, and 2) build the intensity for critical events in the plot.<br/><br/>But these flaws are minor.  What really matters (to me, at least) is the adaption of the book to the screen.<br/><br/>An amazing thing about the movie is that it showed things from the book almost exactly as I had envisioned them while reading the book.  While this might seem to be a negative, it is astounding to see the characters and settings from the book in the tangible world.  Just one example of this would be the Great Hall, where the students of Hogwarts have major gatherings.  Exactly as I saw it with my mind's eye.<br/><br/>I gave this movie an 8/10.  Great use of the special effects to blur the line between magic and reality.  Needless to say (for those familiar with the Potter series), J.K. Rowling's plotline is simply incredible.  Again, read the book, then watch the movie.  It's really a fulfilling experience that way."

","Like the HP books, the movie is a great escape to a fantasy world.<br/><br/>The film-makers have done an excellent job of bringing the book to life, in this reviewer's opinion improving upon the book which is tedious with plot conveniences (only, that is, from the adult point-of-view). The FX are very good; I  liked the big dumb troll. The real and imaginary scenery excellent, and I liked the gate 'nine and three-quarters' transition at the train station, not just the running through the wall, but the change in setting from the business-like, sterile Muggle-world to the character charm - in more ways than one - of the wizard world. <br/><br/>The author's  stipulation to use mostly UK cast  permitted North American viewers to meet seasoned actors not usually seen here. The likeable cast of young actors appeared wooden at times. Rupert Grint was the most relaxed in his role, could even be Oscar material.<br/><br/>Some scenes dragged such as near the end when Hermione speechifies something about brains aren't everything. The veteran actors were better able to carry the sometimes weak dialogue (e.g. Richard Harris as Dumbledore, explaining how mother's love protected Harry from the hands of evil, by a lesser talent would have come off as trite). To someone who hasn't read the book, some aspects of the movie will seem pointless but it does stand alone quite well. I purposely did not read the first HP book beforehand.<br/><br/>Extraordinary details seem what you might expect, such as the living paintings, and the lady-ghost writing at a desk in one of the classroom scenes. I would like a brocade hat like Prof. Dumbledore wears at the closing banquet!<br/><br/>More highlights: Alan Rickman's threatening yet surprisingly sympathetic Professor of the Dark Arts; Maggie Smith's perfect schoolmarm demeanor; Sean Biggerstaff as the young bloke-ish sportsman. Warwick Davis was a delightful professor; David Bradley was spooky as the lanky, leather-coated caretaker; Robbie Coltrane suited the role of Hagrib, and was the clever device to disguise plot explanations by means of a running gag - ""I shouldna' said that..."""

","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (the correct title, ahem) was much anticipated by myself, being an avid fan of the books.  I was looking forward to so much - what would the uniforms look like?  What would Quidditch be like?  I have to say that I was reasonably pleased.<br/><br/>The acting was mostly brilliant - Robbie Coltrane stood out as Hagrid, although his ""yer a wizard, Harry"" line was a little overdrawn - the eyebrow raising was not necessary.  I loved Hermione, I was especially glad they chose a cute little girl.  I know in the books she has bushy hair and big teeth, but I never took that to mean she was plain, and I was glad that they didn't think so either.  I was less enthusiastic about Harry, Daniel Radcliffe certainly looked the part, but his acting was somewhat wooden.  To be fair, his role in this movie is mostly to react to the world around him, a passive part, and as such there was no opportunity for real acting to occur anyways.  Rupert Grint portrayed a winning Ron, and I was also struck by the twins, Fred and George, and am looking forward to seeing them more in the next movies.  <br/><br/>My one real beef was that the plot seemed to be dumbed-down quite a bit. Many of the funniest, wittiest lines were cut and replaced with inadequate exclamations and the like.  Also, there was a fair bit of drama added which was really unnecessary.  Ron's speech to Harry before he sacrifices himself during the chess scene (which, incidentally, was a terrific sequence) was not in character and added nothing to the plot.  J.K. Rowling writes as if her audience is intelligent; I was sad that the film did not have quite the same opinion of us.  <br/><br/>Overall, however, I recommend the film.  It is not the book, but then again, what could be?"

Alan Rickman (Snape) is a true bad guy in most films, and he doesn't disappoint in this one either.  <br/><br/>I knew that not every detail of the book would be able to fit in the 155 min film, and the few details that were left out, really don't affect the actual plot.

His facial expressions and overall acting intensified and reinforced this brave, plucky character for me.<br/><br/>Third, although I was disappointed that two of my favorite parts were cut (Peeves the poltergeist and Hermoine's poison problem-solving), the experience of seeing the movie enhanced the story for me and made me want to read all of the books again."

","Early on in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" an old man tells the title character ""I think we can expect great things from you.""--a line which, given the immense popular response to the books, is something of a prophetic understatement.  Thankfully, the film adaptation of the first in JK Rowling's phenominal series will likely live up to the expectations, or at least pacify the fears, of most fans while providing a pleasant introduction to those who are still wondering what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>Since there are few, even among the uninitiated, who don't have at least the bare bones of the concept down, we'll skip the introductions and move right on to what works and what doesn't.  The best service Chris Columbus has done to the book is not his devout faithfulness in reproducing the narrative, but the top-notch cast he has chosen to embody Rowling's characters.  Daniel Radcliffe does well with Harry, giving him the Everykid appeal that makes the character likeable.  His best moments are in his wide-eyed wonder when he's intoduced to the wizarding world, a look that will probably be reflected in the audience's younger members.  Rupert Grint brings a scene-stealing energy to Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson gives Hermione Granger the right mix of bossiness and charm.  Then there are the adult actors, most of whom need no introduction: Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris. The performances across the board here are good, but with the exception of Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid most of the mature talent is underutilized. Rickman in particular should have been given more to do, having in Snape one of Rowling's most complex creations.  But the players still manage admirably: in particular, Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw (as Harry's nasty uncle and aunt) make the most of their brief screen time.<br/><br/>The settings also deserve special mention.  Hogwart's is a beautifully fantastic fairytale world of imposing Gothic archetecture, moving paintings, an enchanted ceiling and a staircase that Escher would envy.  Diagon Alley is a wonderfully chaotic mix of Charles Dickens and Terry Pratchett, and the Forbidden Forest looks as dark and forboding as the name suggests.  Like the book, the images here create a wonderful world children of any age would love to envision themselves in.<br/><br/>Many of the book's key scenes--the opening delivery of infant Harry to his unwilling surrogate family, a high-energy Quidditch match, a scuffle with a dull-eyed troll in the girl's restroom, and the climactic journey to reach the Sorcerer's Stone--are presented with as much energy and flair as can be hoped for.  However, in attempting to fit in as many of the big set-pieces as possible, screenwriter Steven Kloves has missed some of the less spectacular but nonetheless appealing sections of the book.  In particular, scenes which expanded on the relationship between Harry, Ron and Hermione and their classmates would have brought more depth to the film.<br/><br/>Even as I write this, work is being done to get the second part of the series, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"" on its cinematic feet. If Columbus et al. learn from the few mistakes they made here, that film could be an astonishing triumph.  But for now, ""Sorcerer's Stone"" should appease.  It's not as great as it could have been...but it's more than good enough."

(This is a child who's read the books four times, so he was *really* watching for omissions.)  He realized later that the scene he was looking for really wasn't important, and that it may show up later in the DVD.  The casting was well done, and the acting not bad, considering that the kids are all relative newcomers.  (I can't wait to see more of Oliver Wood/Sean Biggerstaff--what eye candy he is!)  After seeing this, I have changed my mindset about Harry going to Hollywood, and now I can't wait for the rest of the series!"

","There's little doubt that the first of the Harry Potter movies is going to be one of the highest grossing films of all time.  It's also widely agreed that Chris Columbus faced a daunting task in attempting to bring Jo Rowling's fantastically detailed world to the big screen.  He does very well, but, in my opinion, he falls a little short.<br/><br/>The film certainly has a magical feeling to it, and the two and a half hours simply fly by.  Adults and children alike will be more than entertained. But as a die hard Potter fan i was dissapointed by the cuts that had to be made to Rowling's work.  Where was Peeves, the sorting hat song, the howlers?  The lack of these and other details hurt the end result. <br/><br/>Hermione Granger was perfectly played, Ron Weasley was spot on and very funny.  Hagrid was a treat, McGonagel the personification of 'strict but fair' school mistrisses and Snape was truelly mean.  Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry, certainly looks the part, but was wooden at times.  The special effects were excellent, for the most part, and the much anticipated Quidditch match was, for me, one of the high points of this years cinema. <br/><br/>
A must see film, but hard core fans beware!  To truelly appreciate it, read the books, all of them!!"

","Based on the first excellent novel by author J.K. Rowling the film is a wonderful success.When orphaned Harry Potter finds out that he is a wizard he starts school at Hogwarts and is befriended by Ron Weasly, and Hermione Granger. But is disliked by jealous enemy Draco Malfoy. The adventure and fantasy runs wild from the Quidditch field to the stunning climax this film is going to be a classic. Played by Daniel Radcliffe Harry Potter is brought to visual life along with smart young actor Rupert Grint who portrays Ron and pretty Emma Watson as the adventerous witch Hermione. This film lacks the glory of the book at times but it flys by with its run time and is directed very elegantly by Chris Columbus film deserves a ten and is wildly waited for its sequels."

","I have a few friends who were really big Harry Potter fans so when the movie came out they were all a flutter about it.  When my girlfriend, who had just finished the first book, wanted to see the movie I agreed to go along.  I expected some cheesy Disney-esque kiddie film but was realy pleasantly suprised.  Because of this movie I have now read all four books in the series and as i reflect on the movie I really believe that it was an excellent adaptation of the book, having never read any of the books prior to seeing the movie i enjoyed it alot and i am looking forward to seeing it again now that i know the story better.  The characters and their respective actors were excellently chosen, Alan Rickman as Snape was a really good choice in my opinion.  The only real problem i had with the movie as compared to the book was that in reading the book I got a much darker feeling so when the movie was so bright and cheery i found it a little odd, but other than that i think it was a great book/movie translation.  I'm sure that there are a number of Potter heads (hahaha) that will say thing were left out of the movie, but of course they were, there's no way to fit all the story line of the book into a movie and still have it short enough to hold the attention span of its target audience, as it was the movie seemed a little long for yournger Potter fans.  I am really looking forward to the rest of the movies in the series especialy Prisoner Of Azkaban and Goblet Of Fire and the next book.  If you want to see a really good movie that the whole family will enjoy this is the movie for, well, anyone."

But although I really loved the scenery, I liked the story and acting even more! The actors are wonderful, especially the children, and it's truly admirable how well they acted.

","I must admit, I was very excited to see this movie.  My wife and I left work for a few hours to see the first showing today.  I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was quite good.  <br/><br/>I will say this - the book is much better.  This is usually the case, and this instance is no exception.  The book offers so much more insight on what the characters are thinking and what they've been through.  People who have not read the books will miss out on quite a bit if they only see the movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the movie.  The acting was surprisingly good.  Someone had commented on Daniel Radcliff replacing Jake Lloyd (SW - Episode I) as the worse child acting performance - NOT EVEN CLOSE.  Lloyd will forever hold that title.  Radcliff does a very good job, as does Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson and the rest of the cast.  True, Radcliff does have his voice dubbed in parts, but I didn't notice.<br/><br/>The special effects were fantastic.  Very true to the story, and very creative and imaginative.  Nothing will replace the mind's incredible ability of imagination, but the movie does well.<br/><br/>The story also stays true to the book as well.  There are some discrepancies (as one reviewer mentioned, some small characters aren't even named - not even Hedwig!), but that's not surprising as most movie adaptations do that.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is very good.  True Harry Potter fans will appreciate the effort.  9 out of 10."

","For the ones who have read the book in which this film is based this is a funny, enchanting and good movie. For the people who haven't read the novel by J.K.

Everything changes and he is told he is a famous wizard in another world to which he must go to start his studies on Witchcraft and then face the dangerous Lord Voldemort, who killed his parents and wants to control Hogwarts School.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus, who have directed quite a few movies for the whole family, did a great work when adapting the story for the cinema. It's obvious that some details brought on the novel are not included on the film, but the cinema version of Harry Potter's saga pleasing and full of magic anyway. Many things happen on the big screen just like we imagine when reading the book. Highly recommended for everybody who wants to have fun and light entertainment."

","When I saw this movie I had not read a single word of any Harry Potter books, or seen any trailers for this particular movie. Then a good friend of mine dragged me to see this movie. I was very, very, very surprised. To put it simple, I have now read all four of the Harry Potter books, within a month's time, and seen the movie FIVE times in theaters within two months of the release.<br/><br/>So I'm going to flat out tell you, this movie is perfect. Well, the special effects were not up to par. But you can tell where all of the money went, to the writing, and casting. The writing was awesome (almost word for word the book); they chose the perfect actors and actresses. This movie may be 2 1/2 hours long, but the time flies. You don't even realize that you were sitting and watching the movie for 2 1/2 hours.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would recommend this to anyone.

"Nahret","8","0","0","11 April 2002"," All I had been hoping for
","I had the same doubts many others had, namely: Is it worth the hype? And let me tell you, the answer is a resounding YES. Those who stay away from the books only because an evil advertising campaign has made them annoyingly omnipresent, deprive themselves of the genuine pleasure of reading some of the wittiest and most thrilling books ever written for children and adults alike. In spite of some cliches the critics obviously had to complain about, the story is complex and surprisingly profound considering the target audience. And that is where the true strength of the narrative lies, as the storyteller treats the children like adults - which, of course, makes the books interesting for adults. <br/><br/>So, why am I commenting the books instead of the first film here? Because Chris Columbus has done the rare and beautiful thing most directors are incapable of: he translated the first novel practically verbatim to celluloid. Obviously, some things had to be cut out, since the present movie was already some 150 minutes long. Even so, he knew what to cut, and what to keep, and refrained from adding stuff in a kind of auto-tribute to himself, so popular among directors these days. Still, there had to be those who griped about that aspect in particular, calling him uninspired and boring. Apparently, they have not read the book, or they'd know that all we need to know for now is right up there on the screen. <br/><br/>The casting is another strong point of the film. Long before the movie came along, I saw Maggie Smith whenever I read the name of Professor McGonagall; Alan Rickman is just deliciously evil as Professor Snape, dripping poison wherever he roams. The three children do a terrific job, especially Emma Watson as Hermione. And the Dursleys... wonderful. The only one who falls a bit short of the collective expectations is Fang: I think you can't help imagining him so much bigger. For the second part, we can look forward to Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart. I can hardly wait to see that."

","This is a movie which, simply, did not capture me.  ""Big deal"", you say? At under-18, I consider myself part of the film's target audience.  If there are others from this target group that share my views, than the movie has failed on a most fundamental level. Firstly, how on Earth does the drama take an entire year to unfold? Did the characters simply forget about these things for three weeks at a time, then pick up again? On this note, I was also given the impression of a year passing without *anything actually happening*.  The movie seemed to stretch towards its climax, and then kind of sputtered to a close. Secondly, there is another reason why I believe this movie has failed.  At its deepest roots, it is an advertisement for the book.  I was not exactly filled with a desire to read the novel when I exited the theatre.  In fact, if the score had not been done by John Williams I would have viewed my 2+ hours to be a waste of time."

I could watch that scene over and over and over again! His portrayal of Snape is brilliant, awesome, outstanding...there isn't a strong enough word. Nobody could have fitted more perfect for that role. It's a pity he has such little screen time, but hopefully there'll be more Snape-scenes in the upcoming movies!

","The adaptation of J.K Rowling's first installment of the Harry Potter series is, not to be too trite, magical. The children are wonderful and perfectly cast. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry strikes just the right tone of wonder, Rupert Grint plays the role of sardonic Ron Weasley as though he were born to it and Emma Watson walks a very fine line playing Hermione Granger as somewhere between a total prig and someone you'd want as one of your best friends. Robbie Coltrane makes a fine Hagrid (although when I read the books, I kept picturing Brian Blessed in the role). I would have liked to have seen more of Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, but considering the ground the moviemakers had to cover, I am very impressed with the results. All of the major plot points are covered and there is a bit of foreshadowing of events yet to come. The special effects are fantastic, as is to be expected, but do not get in the way of the story. In particular, the Quidditch match is one of the highlights of this action-filled movie.<br/><br/>This long-anticipated event, unlike other recent overly-hyped movies, actually lives up to expectations (at least for me) and I heartily recommend it for the whole family."

","Yeah, I freely admit, I'm one of those scary HP fans who is still really upset I can't find HP bed sheets to fit a queen-sized bed.  Yeah, I really wish they had just done the movie the way the book was.  Yeah, I probably would've gone and seen it more often (even if it had been three and a half hours) if it had been exactly like the book.<br/><br/>But, it wasn't.  It couldn't have realistically been done exactly as it was laid out upon the page.  Oh darn.  I understand all this, but at the same time, it doesn't make me any happier when they changed things that had nothing to do with time constraints.  For example, in the book, Fluffy came from ""a Greek chappie,"" a reference to Cerberus, the 3-headed dog of Greek myth.  In the movie, Fluffy came from an ""Irish"" fellow.  Why this sort of senseless deviation?  Were they 'dumbing it down' for fear kids may go out and research the Classics?  Cutting scenes, I understand.  Changing them for the sake of changing?  That, I don't understand.<br/><br/>On the plus side, they did do a fabulous job with location, special effects, etc.  ""Eye candy"" sums it up--even making less scary parts seem darker and more threatening, but in a subtle, the-kid-next-to-you-doesn't-know-to-scream sort of way.  Wizard chess is much scarier and Quidditch is more exciting when it's played out on the screen.<br/><br/>A few words on the acting...  besides Coltrane (Hagrid)'s sometimes annoying penchant for improv, they actually succeeded in getting some mighty fine actors.  Even the young actors are great, something too many directors unfortunately do not demand.  Grint (Ron Weasley) is a classic Mercutio, though--at times he's more entertaining and likeable than the ""star.""  He did a fabulous job, outshining even Radcliffe.<br/><br/>All of the actors--especially the adults!--could stand to loosen up and get angry / get happy / get scared occasionally.  Everyone, but particularly Shaw (Petunia Dursley), was a bit too stiff and calm during the scene introducing Hagrid.<br/><br/>Despite all of this, a great movie made of an even greater book."

The leads are well cast; with Daniel Radcliffe showing great poise in the title role; and Rupert Grint providing great comedy as Weasley (who seems to get the bulk of the fun dialogue); and Robbie Coltrane practically steals the show as Hagrid.<br/><br/>The set pieces are very well executed; particularly the ball game (very reminiscent of the Ben Hur chariot race or Phantom Menace pod race); and the boy out of control on the broom (I LOVE the way the broom bounces off the buildings!).<br/><br/>This story seems to tap into the traditions of Old English school novels like Tom Brown's School Days; and there also seems to be a hint of satire of the English class system. The one disappointing thing I felt with this film was the contrived way the school house won the contest at the end. I think it might have been a bit more mature to have the rival win, and show you can't win at everything all the time. (but then, I'm probably just an old, cynical muggle!).

But, my boyfriend was a fan and he dragged me to see the film much to my dislike. The film was fun, I've seen it 4 times now, and after seeing the film for the first time I read all the books and im not re-reading them for the third time.  I can't get enough of Harry Potter!<br/><br/>When I saw the film I thought it was amazing, but when I read the book I realised just how much I didn't understand. The film doesn't have enough depth by far.  The visual effects actually had me laughing the third time round, they were really badly done. The one thing that had me squirming in my seat was Daniel Radcliffe.  He was awful, he was fine as long as he didn't speak. I know the book portrayed Harry to be ordinary, but Radcliffe's portrayel was ridiculous.  Wasn't his fault, it was the directors. I was however impressed with the other child actors.  Emma Watson as Hermione was fantastic, I was most impressed with her, and then I found out she hadn't done a single piece of acting in her life!  Rupert Grint was great as Ron, yet his one liners were a bit cringy at times.

And the actor who I think was absolutly perfect was Alan Rickman.  Alan Rickman as Severus Snape was perfect.  I don't even have words to describe it.  Ian Hart was great as the stuttering Quirrell...but not the evil Quirrell.  He over acted on the last scene, which was a disappointment.<br/><br/>The film is a great bundle of fun, but not of high quality.  If you haven't caught up the Harry Potter hype yet, see the movie first, then read the book. You will be hooked!<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","I read parts of the Harry Potter series. I found them uninteresting and immature. Didn't understand what all the fuss was about. So I decided to see this movie.<br/><br/>It's not a complete waste. Good for KIDS. I repeat kids. It is funny in parts and humor is at par with a childrens film. But the storyline seemed slap dash. There was no depth at all, just seemed like everyone was going through the motions. Harry Potter has to be the most boring main character I have ever read in a book, or seen in a movie. He is rather uninteresting and not is not at the fault of the actors. This is a case of bad directing. There are pretty pictures and F/X(I have seen better on Babylon5 and Xena). There isn't much of a storyline either. What storyline was there was rather low key.<br/><br/>The movie didn't have that grand scale feel. Nothing in the movie felt larger then life. Everything felt small and almost TV like. At times it was like a live action cartoon. Which Harry Potter would he better off as. It's cute for kids.<br/><br/>6/10 at best."

"dmarsh-3","10","0","0","21 February 2002"," Some Suggested Improvements
","Spoiler Advisory:  I describe details of several scenes, to make points about character development, mostly.  But I do not reveal any significant plot elements. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful movie.<br/><br/>The people who made it did a superb job in bringing the story to life.  The writing, the casting, the acting, the costumes, the art direction and set design are all first rate.  My children and I have seen it more than once.  Thank you Chris Columbus, thank you Steven Kloves, thank you all. Even such a well-made movie can be improved upon, though. The one element which I think is a weakness in the movie is its failure to properly evoke Harry's innermost thoughts and feelings. The two aspects of this, which were clear in the book but obscure in the movie, were his sense of wonder and astonishment at first encountering the realm of magic, and his fear at not knowing if he would fit in at Hogwarts, or be accepted into the social world of witches and wizards.  In her book, JK Rowling could describe such emotions directly, through an omniscient narrator.  In movies, that has to be done indirectly, usually through dialog.  But for HP&SS this presents a problem.  Harry, given his harsh upbringing by the Dursleys, is an externally passive, uncommunicative character.  For him to convey his feelings so directly would be out of character -- it would not be Harry.  Given this dilemma, the viewer often gets little sense of Harry's emotions, making him seem flat, harder to sympathize with. Normally, criticisms of this sort have a kind of after-the-fact pointlessness.  Even if they wanted to, the movie makers cannot go back and reshoot the movie.  But HP&SS is not a normal movie in that sense.  It is the first in a series, and all the major participants are presumably under contract making the sequels. Thus if 20th Century Fox really wanted to, they could revise, and improve, HP&SS and issue it as a ""special edition"" DVD at little additional cost.  So here are a few suggestions for making Sorcerer's Stone a better movie. At the first flying lesson, have Harry take a short preliminary flight, and have Madam Hooch comment on his natural ability. Then Harry could express surprise, turning into elation, at his unknown talent.  At the end of the flying lesson, when Professor McGonagall hauls Harry away after his unauthorized flight, Harry could mutter fearfully to himself, ""I'm going to be expelled, aren't I?"" Professor McGonagall could reply noncommittally, ""Well, you did violate Madam Hooch's orders, didn't you, Potter?"" On his first night at Hogwarts, Harry sits alone in a window sill, petting Hedwig.  What is he thinking?  Nobody knows.  Why not have him speak to Hedwig, asking her if she is happy at Hogwarts, getting along with the other owls?  If Harry can't divulge his true feelings to other people, maybe he could hint at them to Hedwig.  A later scene of Harry alone with Hedwig, letting her fly out from the snow-covered courtyard, is similarly an emotional blank spot. Harry encounters Professor Dumbledore at the mirror of Erised. Besides just discussing the mirror and its dangers, why doesn't Dumbledore ask Harry how he's feeling?  Harry could be reluctant to reply, but Dumbledore could get at it indirectly, but talking about Harry's mother, who being muggle-born, would also have had a hard time adapting to life at Hogwarts.  A reaction shot could show Harry turning away, trying not to cry. On a different note, Neville's accident at the first flying lesson does not work quite right.  When he falls from the spear, then falls again from the brazier, it doesn't look right. It's not a human body, it doesn't accelerate right.  But more importantly, the scene wrongly depicts Neville in a slapstick way, as someone to laugh at.  But Neville, although hapless, is not a fool.  He is a sympathetic character.  He ought to fall off his broom straight to the ground, from high enough up to evoke fright and pity. What do you think, Chris Columbus and Steven Kloves?  Why not extend shooting on Chamber of Secrets a few days, and make HP&SS a little bit better movie?  My children would appreciate it if you did."

","Yes,just like many other ones' comments:it's great,the film has actually done its best to reveal the funny and amusing plots you can find out  from the book,but I was objectively feeling that if one has not read the book,he may not understand what the film was going on at all.It really has a blurred start,not indicating clearly which is which and made me feel quite disappointed at some places.For example,as we already know that harry was living in Dursleys' bully,and that we definitely won't confuse Harry and Dudly,for Harry's so skinny and Dudly's big size.But the editor maybe thought that when Hagrid said to Dudly,ah,you must be Harry,it might can make watchers laugh.But I really think it an unwise action.And it also missing the story that Harry and Hermione took the dragon nobert to the top of the tower,which i think is attractive and important for the story's going on.But neverthless I would say that the movie is worth watching among so many boring and dull films!!"
"Ajaytee","10","0","0","17 February 2002"," Excellent visual effects and lacking very little
","-Possible spoilers-<br/><br/>An adamant fan of the books I approached the film with a huge amount of caution - this caution however was proven unjustified with an adaptation true to the wonder of J.K. Rowling's novels. Most the humour remains intact indeed Rupert Grint adds enough humour for the whole cast, which compensates for the lack of it from Fred and George Weasley. Grint's facial expressions transform those scenes that could so easily have been just formality scenes that are included to familiarise viewers who haven't read the book with the plot. Emma Watson is excellent at being stuck up but somehow managing to remain warm and likeable as Hermione. And who of course could forget the fantastic performance of Daniel Radcliffe. Expertly chosen from tens of thousands of boys Daniel acted the part with amazing versatility, his light sarcastic humour, his charmingness shows through in the friendship of the central characters. Daniel and Rupert pull on, I believe their own friendship to achieve a fantastic scene at Christmas. Daniel's versatility again demonstrated as the scene changes from his pleasure and amazement at the invisibility cloak to the haunted love that he demonstrates in front of the mirror of Erised.<br/><br/>The adult cast is of course excellent, Maggie Smith plays a fantastic professor McGonagall although I confess the Scottish accent came as a bit of a surprise - don't know why! Richard Harris manages to portray the wisdom and loving of Dumbledore - although I felt much of the friendship between Dumbledore and Harry is missing, being replaced instead with a more formal Teacher - pupil relationship. Alan Rickman is of course suitably menacing as Snape showing the kind of hatred in his eyes not seen since his portrayel of the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. The only dissapointment in the otherwise great adult line up was Ian Hart as the bumbling professor Quirrel - his not having previously read the book showed through in a performance which showed lack of understanding of the character and had no development as the film went on.<br/><br/>The adaptation was as J.K. said very true to the books and with all the missed out scenes such as the discovery of Flamel on the chocolate frog being included on the DVD i feel that Chris Columbus filmed all scenes with a desire to remain as true as possible. Although some scenes were adapted I felt this was completely required to reduce the time from the initial 3 and 3/4 hours of film which had to be edited.<br/><br/>If you want something to complain about then you could say that the opening scenes with the Dursleys were a bit rushed and if they didn't have to show Harry's miserable home life then they would have been almost worth not including.<br/><br/>Higlights of the film: Definately Daniel's stunning performance, quidditch and the chess game plus many more. Lowlights: All to minor to name<br/><br/>In all an excellent film!"

","Rating:****1/2 out of *****<br/><br/>HP&TSS, was a modern day version of Cinderella, The only down this film had to me was how it skipped past a significant about of time that Harry was with the Dursleys, It skipped past most of the books chapter 1, The Boy who lived, and never indicated that Vernon Dursley worked for grunnings: the firm that made drills, it never showed the cat reading the newspapers, and the name Harry Potter, being said in town, and if you never read the book you would of never known that when they were sneaking out of their house hiding from Filch, that they actually intended to have a Midnight dwell with Malfoy, those were the only downs of the movie, the movie only has one cuss word, and three times there's the use of the lord's name in vain.<br/><br/>The Film and novel was especially unique because it had Medevil elements In a modern day era, The Characters were greatly casted and looked better in the movie than on the Card games, and toys, Malfoy was suprisingly a Blond haired skinny boy which I didn't imagine him as in the book, and even I got laughs from Hermione being a motormouthed genius, who reminds me of Lisa Simpson, harry Potters room at home doesn't seem as clostrophobic as the novel made it be it could fit a table and a bed, and still have enough space, My brother walked out of the theater scared during the scence where Hagrid has a flashback of harry's parent's being cursed by Volde-I mean you know who!, The Finale where Harry confronts Voldemort is one of the scariest scences ever put in a good versus evil sorcerer Scence, Voldemort is probably one of the evilest Sorcerer's I've seen on tape, Harry Potter is a unique Fantasy combined with James and the Giant Peach, Cinderella, adventure comedy, Mystery, and Medevil Magic Set in A Modern Era."

","I was actually rather slow as far as the Harry Potter books go. I'm an avid book reader,so I didn't get round to reading the 'Philosophers Stone' (or 'Sorcerers Stone') till a few moths before the film opened. I loved the book, and was really looking forward to the film. I wasn't disappointed. When the film started, I felt as excited as a little kid (I am in fact 22) and was grinning like a mad woman! This film bought back that kind of childish excitment I used to feel when going to see a Disney movie on the cinema. I think we need more films like this. The casting is perfect. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all brilliant. (Ron almost steals the show)and all the grown ups are brilliant too.It's funny,imaginative and exciting. No one should make a fuss about sequences cut from the book, because obviously they  coludn't keep everything.

","After reading the fantastic book, the movie was a little disappointing, so my advice, if you haven't read the book, don't! before seeing the movie, that is.<br/><br/>There were numerous scenes in the book, which weren't in the movie, these weren't impossible things to translate from the book into movie form either, they were simple things. <br/><br/>Personally, I thought the casting was great, I don't think there was anyone miscast in looks/appearance as described in the book, however some of the acting I feel wasn't as good as it could have been.<br/><br/>A big let down I believe was that Prof. Snape was not made out to be as wicked as he appeared to be in the book, he wasn't the kind of ""baddy"" that makes you hiss & boo at the screen, which I believe would have made his character much more appealing, although the actor playing him definately has the ability to do that.<br/><br/>Hopefully the next installment will have a few of the early problems worked out, as I am eagerly looking forward to it, having become a fan of the books :)"

","Apparently this is loved by young people. Have you met them, the young? Think Stephen Dorff and then knock off a centimetre. Twas a book, now 'tis film, squire. The school game Spinach or whatever threatens to bring the film to life after a long wait and has a great other-wordly quality to it. It doesn't last. Just when, like the kids, you are settling into your surroundings you are suddenly confronted with the uncomfortable fact that boarding school is a little mundane and plodding. <br/><br/>It all starts to go a bit pear shaped when 'Da kids' discover a secret room with a large three headed dog in it. According to their rotund chum Hadrig, he was bought from an Irishman. Presumably this was changed from a Greek because the producers thought the adults wouldn't get the reference. What is surprising is that as soon as the kids open the door they are not immediately immersed in a mountain of 'naughty Fido's'. I think they call it a plot hole. Of course, it could be the world's biggest and most constipated dog. With three heads there must be a lot of food going in and a lot needing to go out. Perhaps this is why Fluffy (for it is he) just stands there and easily lets the threesome escape. Any movement in the back legs is severely curtailed by a huge weight in the nether regions. Perhaps in some future movie Hermoine can deliver a spell that will put the poor beast out of it's misery and I'd love to see the pooper scooper. They'll probably need a crane. Speaking of plot holes, I was also puzzled as to why the family of 'muggles' would give up home comforts for a dodgy gaff in Inverness or somewhere for a foster kid they dislike and presumably would be more than happy to see the back of for several terms. Anyway, the dog is more amenable than a troll who stomps through the school presumably in search of a room with Internet access. <br/><br/>The last half of the movie has problems cinematically, being rather static tableau that is, dare I say, a tad dull. Perhaps this sort of thing works better on the page. I suspect school rivalry is more appealing to kids than this darklord stuff, but I don't know. Overall, 'Harry Potter' seems dark and stilted like 'The Phantom Menace'. Films today lack the fun of say 'Bed knobs And Broomsticks' which is easily the superior film, in my rose tinted view. Also, staff putting kids in harms way to fight evil wizards seems distasteful. They should do the job themselves but teachers are over worked nowadays. Too much bureacracy. Too many papers to mark. Either way, school inspectors need to investigate this dodgy place immediately, Britain can ill afford another scandal.<br/><br/>Robbie Coltrane: ""When I took the role in 'Harry Potter', my kids sat me down and told me I had better be careful to get my character right. They warned me that kids would write and let me know if I wasn't successful. Boy, talk about pressure."" Well, you can rest easy Mr Coltrane. You're easily the best thing in it."

","Sure, they could not possibly include all the scenes and action from the book; but it is a movie, not a mini-series and not everything would fit. Nor did they add any new interpretations or expand characters. That was not necessary and it would be unfair to the author and all the loyal fans. And there are a few minor inaccuracies that obsessive fans might notice, but they do not really harm the plot. If you want the WHOLE story, with all of J.K. Rowling's wit and delightful dialogue, read the book. I encourage you to read the book and/or buy the audio tape, which Jim Dale brings to life with some very funny voices. All that aside, the movie is well made, the action scenes are inspiring, and the cast is superb; especially the kids, who look and act like kids (amazing).

","You would have to have been comatised not to have heard of Harry Potter this year! Even when we were on holiday in France my son found the J K Rowlings books `with different covers Mummy'. Sunday 4th November saw the World Premiere of the long awaited film adaptation of the first book, which was attended by a galaxy of celebrities clutching their children's hands.<br/><br/>`Why didn't we go?' demanded my seven-year-old, while watching the GMTV report on Monday morning. `Because we're not rich or famous enough!' I replied My son gave me an accusing look as he realised I was a failure. In order to salvage a bit of status I duly booked up for the premiere screening at my local cinema. By the time Saturday arrived I think I was more excited then they were!<br/><br/>Taking our telephone booked seats I was aware of a slight problem. Row C was a bit close to the screen for my long-sighted senile myopic vision. And for the first few minutes I wonder why a vastly expensive film had been shot out-of-focus! However as the book came to life before my eyes this problem became irrelevant.<br/><br/>Anyone who has read the book will have created strong images of both characters and locations. I am happy to report that my images on both accounts were more than fulfilled.  Privet Close was an 80's housing development, rather than the 60's estate of my imagination, but that is probably more to do with my age! Everything else was perfect. The Dickensan appearance of Diagon alley, the power and wonder of the steam train (I think I'm showing my age again!), the majestic gothic Hogwarts, all enhanced by shooting from the perspective of a 11 year old. As for the characters, well Robbie Coltrane IS Hagrid! And Alan Rickman as Snape was as nasty, if better looking, than the Snape my mind created. Of the young newcomers all were excellent. Whilst Harry's incredulous wonder at the turn his life has taken probably reflects Daniel Radcliffe's own feelings, as he stood, hopefully, viewing the images of his dead parents tears prinked my eyes.<br/><br/>Although I was aware that Gloucester Cathedral had been used for part of Hogwarts I failed to detect its presence. Either I was too engrossed in the film for this type of detail or it was heavily disguised.<br/><br/>My own favourite scene is the Quidditch match. Quidditch is the wizard world's equivalent of football, with the exception that it is exciting to watch! Played on broomsticks with seven players aside the red ball, or Quaffle, is put in one of three hoops by opposing teams to score 10 points. The game is complicated by Bludgers, rogue black balls that zoom around trying to dislodge players. However two beaters have the job of protecting the rest of the team. Each team has a seeker whose job it is to catch the golden snitch, a walnut-sized ball that not only darts about but disappears from sight. The catching of the snitch scores 150 points and ends the game. Watching this game you will believe that broomsticks can fly and will hanker after your own Nimbus 2000.<br/><br/>For a writer to have so much control on a film is usual. Nick Hornby voiced the opinion, it's best to take the money and run! Joanna Harris was annoyed at the change of the heroine's distracter from priest to mayor in Chocolat! Whilst the film is not an exact replication of the book it is as near as a two and a half hours adaptation can be. That's two and a half hours which whiz by so that, like Harry, you are disappointed to be leaving Hogwarts!<br/><br/>11th November 2001<br/><br/>PS Senile myopia is one of the downsides of passing 40!"

Truly a lovely and enchanting tale that focuses on good against evil, but without the usual condescending hoopla!   Unique in every aspect that will touch any child's imagination, bewildering them with a touch of Tom Brown School Days, Oliver Twist; and even Christmas Carol.  What makes a better story for children than a tale about an abused young orphan who gradually finds out that he has a lot to offer to his precious world?  Sure, this movie may not have the jaw-dropping appeal, craved by some.  But the GCI effects play well to pump up great charm, mystery, and bountiful of fun.  Watching the Quidditch match and the host of owls sweeping through the dining room is already worth the price of the tix!  The interior of Hogwart School is so unbelievably extravagant, from the dining room to the staircase and then to the common room.  I was simply mesmerized.  And Daniel Radcliffe is a welcomed Harry Potter. This young actor speaks with his eyes, and not with his gestures, and I love the way the camera focuses on his expressive eyes. He has the image of the sort of kid we would love to have in our home and school!   So idealistically pure, gentle and specialÂ… even in mischief!  My only wish is to see him putting out more gusto with his humor and defiance as the book's Harry.  And the overall cast of actors?  Very delightful, and so true to the book characters!  Little Ron Weasley's performance is tops piping out cool and unexpected humor during the most insignificant times.  And Alan Rickman as Professor Snape: this guy actually sends chills down my spine!  Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid awesome: better than my image of the book character. And Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall strict, yet with a heart of gold! Yep, lots of actors in an amazing line-up of extraordinary portraitures! Thumbs up to Chris Columbus he certainly has the knack to grip even a six-year old child's attention.  Sure, there are scary parts, but created with taste for the kids in mind.  It's a fast paced movie that has certainly succeeded in bringing the wonderful world of Harry Potter to the silver screen!  Definitely a must-see movie for every child between the ages of six to fourteen, and for anyone longing for some magical moments in his/her life!"

","The Following text contains spoilers of this movie and sequels Please refrain from reading if you haven't watched the movie If you have but you haven't read the books, don't read past the line of asterics.<br/><br/>Hello, I'm a major Harry Potter fan.  I have read all four books (several times) and I have countless discussions and speculations on how the entire series is being played out with my friends.  I love movies but am not an expert on them, but I do enjoy commenting on them.  For this movie, I must congradulate Columbus for not just screwing up this movie, but damaging some of the points that are in the upcoming sequels.  I couldn't stand the movie. most movies make me sit there, give me the odd thing to laugh about - unless I'm watching a comedy where I'm rolling on the ground not able to hear the next line because I'm laughing so hard for a full 2 hours (which is why I don't watch them in the theater) - and keep my focus but as far as I could tell, there was only one humorous sceen that they wasted in the comercials.<br/><br/>Before I describe what it dents for the upcoming movies, I'd like to describe what was wrong with its translation from the book.<br/><br/>First, and I have had several fights with my mom over this, but I felt that while the Dursleys definitely deserved less screen time than book time, they were cut a bit too short.  You just didn't get the feel of the absolute hatred that the Dursleys felt for Harry, or vice versa.  Of course, my mom would be perfectly all right if they were cut completely (shakes his head).<br/><br/>Second, (being a major logic person) I wanted to see Snape's challenge. It was a puzzle I would have somewhat liked to have been mapped out in the book (ie, given us an idea of where each of the bottles were) and was hoping for in the movie.  By far, that was my greatest disappointment.<br/><br/>Third, I rather enjoy the remarks and retorts that are tossed around between Draco Malfoy and Harry (and there respective friends).  However, I guess when you're translating something from book to movie, anything unnecessary must be thrown out.  Still, like I said above, there was a considerable lack of humor and the fights Harry and Malfoy have would have made up for it.<br/><br/>Fourth, my friends and I have had an ongoing argument on how to pronounce Hermione.  We thought that it was settled in the fourth book when she pronounced it Her - my - oh - nee, whereas in the movie its more like Herm - oh - nee.  This is likely not a major issue to most of the world because that's how the majority of the world pronounces it (or so I understand) but I think that when you are trying to decide between what's normal for the world and what the author decreed, you should go with the author.<br/><br/>************************************************************************<br/><br/>Now, my comments on the upcoming movies.<br/><br/>In the book, after the first of the letters from Hogwarts are recieved (and through all the books afterwards) Harry is moved into Dudley's junk toys bedroom at the beginning of the movie.  On the one hand, it would be a major flaw in movie magic for him to all of a sudden be in a bedroom but on the other, it is a major flaw in translating the books into movies.<br/><br/>Also, the Quidditch match was fairly long, so I'm interested to see how they manage to get everything into The Prisoner of Azkaban (#3) and all three Quidditch matches.  (Though I must say, I enjoyed the different spin on the match that was put in there - mainly the viciousness of Flint).<br/><br/>I hope they don't strip Lucius Malfoy's two parts.  They are enjoyable better even than (while we're at it, hopefully they don't remove too much of Dobby either - ie. his being freed and his requirement to start smacking himself with the nearest heavy object)."
"JohnABrennan","10","0","0","29 January 2002"," True to the fabulous book that inspired it.
","Harry Potter has captured my imagination and taken it places I've not thought possible.  The movie was pleasant to look at, with gorgeous scenery and eye-popping special effects.  I was shocked to see that 'Harry' hadn't cracked the top 50 fantasy movies.  Judging by the numbers, I'm in the minority, but if I compare this series to the Lord of the Rings, there is no contest in my opinion.   Harry takes the day.   The Lord of the Rings would be a three-hour nap for me.  Perhaps I dislike it because I had to read 'Rings' in school, although I had to read `The Adventures of Tom Sawyer' and became a huge life-long Mark Twain fan.<br/><br/>The movie is true to J.K. Rowling's wonderful book, and I, for one, cannot wait until the next installment!"

","I thought the movie was great, but it could've used a little more humor that J.K. Rowling wrote in the book.  So as not to make the film to heavy.  My favorite scene was with the Mirror of Erised.  It was so touching, I wanted to jump into the movie and just hold Harry and be there for him.  One of the advantages about the Mirror is it let him see what his parents looked like and could put that into his memory.  All in all a very good movie."

","Not since the release of Star Wars in the 1970s have I truly experienced a film, and not just viewed it, until I was whisked away by the magic and wonder of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I've read the four books of the series more than once, and wondered how a film would be able to capture the fantasy and imagination of such a writer as J.K. Rowling. The movie was brilliant, with its special effects,which were incredible, somehow appearing so real! The adventures of Harry, so wonderfully portrayed by young Dan Radcliffe, have taken me back to the wonder and excitement of my own childhood imaginings. I find myself thankful that my own children, who love the books and the movie, are experiencing the kind of movie-magic that made me so happy as a child, when at that time, it was George Lucas who took us to a galaxy far, far away to ""lose"" ourselves, in awe, at the magic he created...It seems as though, finally, the magic has returned with the story of this young boy who is suddenly brought this unex pected revelation of his unusual heritage, and by the sheer fact of who he is, he becomes thrust into that powerful struggle of good and evil, when sometimes it can be difficult to discern what is the good, what is the evil...We're cheering you on, Ms. Rowling, and everyone who has a part in ""bringing to life"" the heroic Harry Potter!

","Co-star Richard Harris said of the book, ""It's not my cup of tea.""  This from a man who has probably read ever great novel and performed every great play written.  In other words, her prefers stories which stick to the ribs as opposed to cotton candy which will melt away in the shadow of adulthood. For a blockbuster film filled with special effects HARRY POTTER has surprising zilch to offer as far as groundbreaking cinema.  We've all seen films about magic, broomstick flying, monsters, etc... and though the production values are far beyond that of a CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, they are not beyond that of SUPERMAN, and the story falls far from the film perfection of a MARY POPPINS or the classic literacy of C.S.Lewis.  The acting by the youngsters get the job done but don't expect to see much more of them (except for sequels), and the older famous counterparts give their usual professional turns that seem to be lifted from previous roles.  In essence, the hype of the books have carried over to carry the film.  The story line pales against the classics and there goes the real story.  Most college students would have a difficult time reading the classics by Verne, Stevenson, Homer, Melville(the original versions), and Harry Potter (a step above Dr. Seuss, but without the wit or satire) gives students a chance to say they have actually read a book that wasn't a comic book.  HARRY POTTER will be forgotten before the next generation arrives and be buried alongside PIPPY LONGSTOCKING in the LET'S-NOT-ADMIT-WE-ACTUALLY-ENJOYED-THIS crypt of forgotten lore.  But back to HARRY POTTER, a muddy muddle of a movie. England has never looked more drab, magic has never looked more insignificant, and Brits have never looked more stupid.  Chris Columbus, who did a terrific job with YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES shows none of the imagination he showed in that film.  Trimmed by an hour this film would be a nice diversion on children's TV, but as a cinematic event, it falls way too short."

","Everyone knows that technically this movie is top notch. Special effects, acting, directing; the whole package is as good as it gets. The team has accurately brought the best selling children's fantasy book to the screen, delighting children and earning themselves bank-loads of money.<br/><br/>
That's great for kids and the studios, but what about adults? Actually, there's not very much at offer. Chris Columbus and Ms Rowling seem stretched pretty thin story-wise in this first installment of Harry Potter. Quidditch? The chess game? Learning to ride a broomstick? Big Deal. It doesn't seem new and not even on par with a Star Trek installment. It more resembles Disney's early 60s efforts like Herbie the Love Bug. Ok, so Harry's supposed to be in about the fifth grade or so. When he ages will the stories get more mature also? No, they won't. Four, five, six more Harry Potter films? Not for me, one or two will probably suffice."
"fuyuno","Null","0","0","30 January 2002"," Here's what went wrong. (Spoilers)
","This is a fairly faithful translation of the novel into a well filmed movie. As such it deserves full credit.<br/><br/>A lot of people were disappointed by this movie for various reasons. The little details were omitted, for one. Uncle Vernon and the Dursleys were not as terrible as in the book which subtracted from the urgency behind Harry's need to fit in at the strange school and his need to avoid being expelled and, consequently, his courage in defying Draco Malfoy and other ""established"" students, for another. <br/><br/>But the thing that kept the movie for soaring like the novel is the absence of the ""Huckleberry Finn Moment"". That's the moment when Huckleberry makes the transition from boy to man with the words ""All right then! I'll *go* to Hell!"" That moment is also in the original novel of this Harry Potter story, when Harry gives his reasons why he must risk expulsion *and* danger to his life and go after the Philosopher's Stone. That inspired speech is conspicuously missing from this movie version.<br/><br/>You might say that what went wrong is the absence of emotional tension. In the book Harry, Ron and Hermione are all walking an emotional tightrope for different reasons. The book was a stage where childhood trauma meets Greek Drama with lots of enchanting hocus pocus thrown in between. In the movie, the hocus pocus was well represented, the Greek Drama was subdued and the childhood trauma was nearly absent. <br/><br/>I hope that Chris Columbus, or whoever will direct the next installation, will take the advice of all the disappointed viewers who posted here because a lot of excellent points are made about what went wrong. I hope he will ask himself why stories of orphans have continued to capture our imaginations over the centuries even though so few of us are actually orphans.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a fair seven out of ten. But it could have been better."

Worst of all is of course the cheesy special fx. Any Hercules or Xena episode would easily level the fx used here. And the casting.. Daniel Radcliffe may look the part, but can hardly act it.

"stamper","8","0","0","28 January 2002"," Magical at (almost) every level
","First of all I feel obligated to tell all of you, that I'd never read a book or even heard something of Harry Potter, before I went to see this film. All I knew was, that he is a wizard who goes to a wizard school and has adventures there. I picked that much up from the hype that has become Harry Potter since the first book was published.<br/><br/>
On to the movie. I must say that despite the many followers of the Harry Potter hype, including the millions that have read the book or seen the film, I kept sceptical about whether I'd like this film. I mean I am almost 21 years old, so maybe it would be too childish for me, who knows? But it was not. It was just as childish as I like it. Christopher Columbus has really outdone himself here. I mean he's made a couple of good films, but this comeback (after the pretty solid Stepmom and the box  office loser Bicentennial Man) really makes this effort stand out so much more.<br/><br/>
It is however not only Chris Columbus' quality that made this film what it is. Much of the praise has to go to the writer Mrs. Rowling and to the actors and actresses. I could go on and on about the fact that every actor was good, but what really was astonishing in my mind is, that all children actors and actresses were so good. I mean they were GREAT. They are in my mind even better than the grown ups, because this movie is about the kids, not the adults. The four main wannabe' wizards, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley and Draco Malfoy (who does not only have a name that reminds one of Count Dracula, but looks like a version of him as well), all give you the feeling that many things are yet to come and that many things will happen between them. I mean I am no psychic, but I'd say that someday that little count Dracula will become Harry Potter's opponent and that maybe one day (if they get old enough in the stories) Mrs. Granger and Mr. Potter might become more than friends although I'm not sure of that. Maybe I've just seen the Star Wars films too often. If I have, it does not matter anyway, for the cast and crew of this film have watched them too often as well. One part of the music clearly is like Star Wars, there is a hat with a Yoda  like speech pattern plus the teachers want to keep Harry Potter away from the dark side of the force, oh sorry MAGIC!' Come on!!! They've seen Star Wars and learned from it! Not that it bothers me, on the contrary! I am quite pleased to see that people are able to see and pick out something good and insert it into their own work either as an homage or simply because it appeals to them.<br/><br/>
There were few things bad in this film. Actually it was only one thing. SPECIAL EFFECTS. Where the heck did Warner Bros. get those guys? I mean one time they create world class effects and then the next you can easily spot the blue screen from miles! It was not as bad that it ruined my experience of the film, but be honest, in a film of this magnitude, you can expect good Effects throughout (see The Lord of The Rings: The fellowship of the Ring or Artificial Intelligence). The effects really were a let down for me at times, but maybe they just overdid it. There were times, in my opinion, that a blue screen would not have even been necessary. Those were also some of the times you could tell the landscape was projected onto a blue screen. Better luck next time.<br/><br/>
After the huge success of this film (and even if the success had been more moderate) there will be a number of sequels. Actually two more films are already planned (set for release in 2002 and 2004) and it is believed, that if Mrs. Rowling writes all seven books (as she intended to do), there will be seven films made in total. There are a few things I would like to say to Warner Bros. in regard to those films. First of all, make sure that you will have all original actors necessary for the sequels under contract and if not so persuade them with lots of money. Do not, I repeat DO NOT hire other actors to play characters already portrayed by someone else. Second, hold on to your screenwriter. He has been successful so far in doing what he does. Third, hold on to the man that composed the music. In a franchise you want to keep the music the same throughout all films. If possible even to make the music so memorable, that it makes people say: That the music from Harry Potter.' Fourth and last, hold on to your director (at least for the next one or two sequels, preferably for all if he is up to it).  He has worked with all those kids before and knows how to talk to them and how to make them perform well. Plus this is not some Mission: Impossible or James Bond like franchise in which you want every movie to stand on his own. It is supposed to be more of an Indiana Jones kind of franchise. If you do, however change your director, may I suggest that you do is as George Lucas did with the original Star Wars trilogy. Get basically unknown directors, who know their way around a studio and get them to make the film, how you want it to be done. Approaching a director switch like that, will allow all films to fit into the big picture, without inconsistent film styles ruining it.<br/><br/>
A good film for the whole family, but just as The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the Ring, it falls short to be best film of the year.<br/><br/><br/><br/>8,25 out of 10"

"Papa Lazarou","9","0","0","10 November 2001"," Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - bloody brilliant!
","I confess - I was getting heartily sick of all this Harry Potter hype until I read the book to see what all the fuss was about and found myself really looking forward to it.<br/><br/>Having seen it the other day, all I can say is that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is (to quote Ron) 'Bloody brilliant!  Not only a very faithful adaptation, but a very fine film.  It's a huge return to form for Chris Columbus - easily his best since Mrs Doubtfire and, with the possible exceptions of some of his early screenwriting work (esp. Gremlins), his best work yet.  He's played a blinder, simply by remaining true to JK Rowling's original book.<br/><br/>The film is like a Readers' Digest condensed novel, transferring all of the key scenes to the big screen but losing some of the detail.  Whilst that means some of the subtleties of the book are missed, the film's visual strength more than makes up for it.  Everything looks exactly as it should, from the Dursleys' quiet suburban home, to Diagon Alley and the mad gothic castle that is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Most importantly, all the characters seem to have walked straight from the page. Unlike Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse (who had to be changed to be more like John Thaw), Rowling won't have to change descriptions in future Harry Potter books to match the films.<br/><br/>Not since Ian Fleming's (initially grudging) approval of Sean Connery's James Bond has an author been so vocal in their support of someone else's version of their work and their characters.  Conan Doyle never saw a Sherlock Holmes with sound, so it's left for Sherlockians to argue the case for their ideal Holmes be it Basil Rathbone, Jeremy Brett, Tom Baker, (my favourite) Robert Stephens, or any one of hundreds.  Tolkien fans will no doubt contest some of Peter Jackson's casting decisions for his Lord Of The Rings trilogy and the dear departed JRR himself is not available for comment.  With Rowling's blessing, Daniel Radcliffe is Harry Potter, Robbie Coltrane is Hagrid, and so on and so forth.  This input from the author, combined with the apparent intention of everyone involved in the making of the movie to be as true to the book as possible, lends the film an undeniable authenticity.<br/><br/>The novel and the film can each quite easily stand up without the support of the other but reading the book can certainly add to the enjoyment of the film and, perhaps surprisingly, the film can actually enrich the experience of reading the book.  Certainly Quidditch makes a lot more sense after watching it on screen (they really ought to consider it for the next Olympic Games).<br/><br/>An excellent family film and (at last) a blockbuster worthy of the title. Highly recommended."

"dennis-77","Null","0","0","27 January 2002"," Umm, what do I think of this film
","HP and the Philosopher's Stone is a very difficult film to review, mainly because I'm in two minds about it.<br/><br/>On the one hand, it's a good film with Hogwarts in particular being beautifully shot.  I want to go to school there.<br/><br/>On the other, as an adaptation of the book, it lousy.  Truly lousy.  For instance, Malfoy, who still does come over as the school bully from hell, seems to have had half his lines cut, or they've been inserted into a different part of the story.<br/><br/>And I'm not even a hardliner, if the cuts and changes were necessary it would be okay, but several of them are not, a case in point the Quidditch match.  The match I saw on screen was exiting yes (one of my favourite scenes actually), but not the match in the book.  What happened to Flint's body check on Harry, and Lee Jackson commentary (one of my favourite parts of the book)?  It would have been easy enough to have in.<br/><br/>I suppose the problem is the little cuts (Hagrid on the boat, in Diagon Alley, Snape's leg) added up, especially since the moved scenes tended to be my favourites.<br/><br/>What especially upset me is (SPOILER)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hermionie's character beats Snape's part of the protection in the book, in this she just tagged along after saving Ron and Harry from the weed thing. Actually what did happen to Snape's part of the defences?  They seemed to have gone missing.<br/><br/>And she doesn't have that awful speech about things other than books and cleverness being important.<br/><br/>But this is a film review, not a book review so, on it's own merits as a film it's good.  And in some parts very good, but as not even a fan of the books to any great extent, I found the changes disturbing, especially the horrific scene at the end where the bad guy turns in to dust.  Hello, it wasn't in the books so why do it, it's no better than the scene in the book, though I imagine it was easier to film it the way they have.<br/><br/>The main good points: Harry - comes over much better than in the books. Quirrell - wonderful acting. Hagrid - just yay. Dumbeldore- despite having half his lines cut.  I wanted the socks line. Seamus - very funny"

","Well, sooner or later you goodlies here at the Internet Movie Database would have to hear from us at Hogwarts. That said, let me thank the Muggles of 1492 Pictures and Heyday Films, whose combined talents were instrumental in making our film possible.   Where, I wonder, should I begin? Perhaps we should give a proper thumbs-up to Steve Kloves for crafting such a magnificent screenplay. I only hope that the goodlies at Don Shay and Jody Duncan's Cinefex Magazine will put together an official making-of-the-film book, so that everyone can remember the adventure we shared with our Master Potter. Richard Harris does such a tremendous job bringing me .... well, to life --- so much so, in fact, that I doubt I will ever be seen in the same light again. I will, however, tell you that, during the Los Angeles World Premiere of the film, an Associated Press photographer --- one with a very keen eye, I might add! --- caught yours truly shaking hands with David Hasselhoff! (Would that I could have done a guest shot on Baywatch! [Heh-heh!] It might have been fun teaching Mitch Buchanan and company a few lessons in water safety --- Hogwarts style!)<br/><br/>Anyway, John Seale's cinematography was insightfully delicious; as were the wonderfully spirited costumes of Judianna Makovsky. Richard Francis-Bruce was a masterful film editor; and the visual effects units, under the supervision of Robert Legato, and utilizing the services of such effects legends as Sony Pictures Imageworks, Industrial Light and Magic, Rhythm & Hues Studios and a few others, brought rainbows to the eye and inspiration to the heart. I just hope, when the 74th Academy Awards roll 'round, that we can indeed make the cut in terms of the technical awards (Sound, Sound Efects Editing, Cinematography, Film Editing, Costume Design, Visual Effects, etc.)<br/><br/>And yes, that lovely John Williams score. The main theme tickles my brian every time I hear it. I'm especially proud of John's version of the Hogwarts school song, here entitled ""Hogwarts Forever!"" I only wish they'd tracked down old Leslie Bricusse, that he might add a few lyrics to the tune.<br/><br/>And the story? Ah yes, the story. Many of our fans the world over know of Harry's origins, so I shall not recap that aspect of the story for you. But the heart of the saga involves the efforts of Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) to prevent the Sorcerer's Stone from falling into the hands of Lord Voldemort, who of course also seeks to finish what he apparently started a decade before ..... by murdering young Harry. Robbie Coltrane did an enjoyable job portraying old Hagrid --- I must say it is one of his most huggable roles yet! Maggie Smith, meanwhile, was quite tremendous as the doppelganger of Professor McGonigall. I'm sure Minerva herself had the chance to view an advance copy of the film prior to the various premieres and such.<br/><br/>Lastly, let me tell you good people this: Some of you have come away from the movie feeling disappointed that not everything in the book found its way into the film. The magic of the movies, my friends, has always been built on the premise that you should suspend disbelief. So it is with the magic we try to accomplish here at Hogwarts: As long as you are willing to imagine, believe, and embrace what you once were when you were a child, then certainly the magic that dwells within you can be let loose again. I hope that this is the case with everyone who sees our movie, its forthcoming sequel, and the several such sequels yet to come; and I hope as well that similar fortune may yet smile upon our next printed adventure --- ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""<br/><br/>Yours most sincerely,<br/><br/>Albus Dumbledore Headmaster Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"

"The Mad Reviewer","9","0","0","16 January 2002"," This is the Harry Potter I imagined while reading.
","HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE (2001) Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>I must say that you don't have to be a fan of the books in order to fully appreciate this film. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that you might appreciate it even more if you haven't read the book (the three people I saw it with loved it just as much as me, a person who has read the book). For one, you have no idea what's going to happen, so everything is unpredictable. And two, whatever is left out of the book wont bother you. Having said that, I wont compare and analyze the book and film to death, like so many others have done already because as a stand-alone film, it's pretty amazing.<br/><br/>The casting is something along the lines of ideal. Rupert Grint is ideal as Ron, the clownish chess friend with a heart of gold, and Emma Watson IS Hermione, from her brainy smugness to her fierce loyalty. Daniel Radcliffe, as the courageous but modest orphan with extraordinary abilities, is utterly captivating. Harry lives, thanks to this talented twelve-year-old. The chemistry and friendship between the three is undeniable. Robbie Coltrane IS Hagrid, the lovable giant with a fondness for dangerous creatures. Alan Rickman is sufficiently creepy and sinister as Professor Snape. Crisp, stern Professor McGonagall is brought most believably to life by Maggie Smith, while John Cleese does a delightful, if brief, turn as Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, the ghost who haunts Harry's dormitory. John Hurt has a splendid, though again short, appearance as an eccentric wand-maker, Zoe Wanamaker is wonderfully spirited as flying teacher Madam Hooch and I enjoyed Ian Hart and Richard Harris as Professor Quirrel and Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, respectively.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus and Steve Kloves did a great job of bringing the story of a modern-day boy-wonder from the pages of Rowling's incredible book to life. Columbus clearly has a knack for directing children, he shows it here as well as in the Home Alone flicks and Mrs. Doubtfire. And since I had recently seen (and liked) Wonder Boys, a film which Steve Kloves had adapted and earned an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, I had faith in his ability to adapt books into films. Most of the important events are there, with one or two new episodes to replace large amounts of text, which works just as well.<br/><br/>As for the visual effects, they were pretty slick. I've read many reviews in which people have thought that the effects were bad. But, I enjoyed them a lot and thought the best use of them was in the Quidditch scene. It was fast, loud and damnit, it was just cool! I liked it.<br/><br/>Overall, highly enjoyable and entertaining. The cast was great, the direction was great, the visuals were sharp and the screenplay was well-adapted. The score by John Williams is memorable as well and every time I here the theme, it gives me goosebumps."
"Pelakh","9","0","0","16 November 2001"," Almost perfect
","I had extremely high expectations for this movie, and it met almost all of them. The only thing that slightly marred this otherwise excellent adaption was the absence of the potion challenge in the final sequence, and it dropped my rating from 10 to 9, since I felt it was one of Hermione's defining moments. However, the rest of the movie was spectacular - superb acting (Rickman, Smith, Coltrane - too many to mention, really), good pacing in the direction. But the main thing that struck me, an avid reader of Rowling, is that everything looked RIGHT - never once did I see something in the movie that conflicted with how I imagined the book. For this, Columbus and crew should be greatly commended. I cannot wait until the Chamber of Secrets."

i can't wait until her next book. and i've already made up my  mind that i would see 'Chamber Of Secrets'<br/><br/>but, i absolutely dispised the movie, they butchered it. they did no justice at all to the book. there were countless numbers of missing scenes, they didn't go into enough detail, and it was hard for my fiance{whom i dragged} to follow along. i ended up having to describe the missing scenes to him just so he could get it straight. not only did they butcher the book, but they took apart a few scenes and reconstructed them. the scenes in the forest, the baby dragon, the zoo, etc. i understand that they were on a time limit, but if they want to pride themselves in staying true to the book then they need to stay true to the book, the entire reason why the movie was made was to take the book to a next level.<br/><br/>i'm not expecting anything great from the next 2 movies. and i'm not expecting them to stay remotely close to the books. and i hate to be crude but i think that they could have gotten better actors, to fit the roles. i didn't like the kid that played Ron, and i felt that they could've found some one much better then Alan Rickman, i love Alan Rickman as a actor, but not in this movie at all. he looked like a moping misfit from some teenage Goth party. like at any second he was going to start crying his eyes out.<br/><br/>

The film has a plot that seems to be written by a five-year old, it is not as exciting as the book, as interesting as the book, it seems to me that Hollywood it´s great at destroying every script that touches. Ok, the special effects are fine, it is true, but there is nothing spectacular. You are paying to see some kids talking about things that seem to be the work of a kid who wrote his last dream. Chris Columbus, has also proved to be a conventional director, who uses sentimentalism to entertain and sometimes to guide all the filme.

"camille-7","Null","0","0","16 November 2001"," I was not one bit disappointed and I read all four books.
","They say opinions are like hind ends and everyone has one.  Well, here is another hind end opinion.  I went to see the movie on its opening day in America and I just loved it and I am almost 50 yrs old.  I have always been a lover of fantasy and these books were certainly the best fantasy books I have ever read plus I was not in the least disappointed in the movie.  They did an awesome job.  Yes, there were a few changes and omissions here and there, some differences in characterizations and story line but not so much different that it ruined the story.  Over all, very well done. <br/><br/>
I don't know how anyone could be disappointed in Daniel Radcliffe.  He was Harry!  Yes, his character was more low key than Ron and Hermoine but he had to be that way.  It was a good balance between their characters.  Ron is supposed to be funny, Hermoine is supposed to be bossy and Harry is the straight guy.  I thought he was perfect.  Ron (Rupert) and Hermoine (Emma) were perfect in their roles also and Rupert's character shone during the climactic chess scene. The other children were also very good.  Neville and Oliver Wood did their roles perfectly and Draco Malfoy was good but didn't seem to be quite evil enough.  Something was a little lacking there.  I enjoyed the other Weasley brothers and hope to see more of them in the next film, especially the pranksters Fred and George who had too little time in the movie but that was understandable because there's only just so much you can fit in to get the story told.  <br/><br/>As to the adults, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Alan Rickman as Snape just seemed to walk right out of the pages of the books into their roles.  When I first read the book, I pictured Alan Rickman as Snape immediately and was very pleasantly surprised when he got the role.  Ian Hart was also good as Quirrel as was David Bradley as Filch.  David Bradley played a similar role in the Masterpiece Theatre production of ""Our Mutual Friend"".  I agreed with many that Maggie Smith was too old to play Professor McGonagall, having pictured a woman in her early 50's for the role.  However, she was so excellent in the part that in her case age was irrelevant.  I was disappointed with Richard Harris as Dumbledore.  He certainly looked the part but he seemed too feeble and quiet.  You had to really strain your ears to hear some of his last lines of dialogue.  Yes, Dumbledore is a very old wizard but the strength of characterization he had in the book seems to be lacking a little in Mr. Harris.  I thought Sean Connery would have been a much stronger Dumbledore and would have looked fine with the white hair and beard.  <br/><br/>As for the scenes.  I was absolutely riveted to my seat during the chess scene.  It was the highlight of the film.  The Quidditch match, the mirror of Erised and Diagon Alley were also standouts.  Though during the Quidditch match there seemed to be a lot of shots of Harry just sitting there in midair watching the match when he should have been looking for the snitch. Yes, I noticed that Harry was sometimes digital but it was such a small portion that how could anyone think that it wrecked the scene?  I wish they had introduced all of the members of the Quidditch team.  The part involving Norbert the Dragon was rather brushed off in the movie as were the ghosts.  Where was Peeves? And John Cleese's part as Nearly Headless Nick was way too small though what little he did was very good.  Those moving pictures on the walls were awesome.  The finale in the great hall lacked the excitement of the book as the whole school realized that the Gryffindors were beating the Slytherins. It just didn't seem to be enough.  <br/><br/>The things I didn't like were much less than the things that I did like so all in all it was excellent.  Do not take small children, please!  A little boy sat on his dad's lap behind us and kept saying he wanted to go home because he was scared. Several scary scenes for the little ones.  I hope this film gets a nod during Oscar time.  The three child stars deserve a special mention and Robbie Coltrane certainly deserves best supporting actor.  4 stars!!"

Don't!  Bad advice.  Very bad advice.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this book when I first read it and enjoyed it again when I read it again the week I saw the movie opener (actually I listened to audio tapes, which I feel are far superior to reading the books; the emotion that Jim Dale puts into the readings are truly extraordinary and need to be experienced).  But that made me watch the movie looking for differences rather than sitting back and enjoying the movie for what it was.<br/><br/>Of the seven of us who went, two had never read the book (one did not even know what a Nimbus 2000 was, if you can believe that!), and I think they got the most out of the movie; the other four had not read it recently and thoroughly enjoyed it.

"Vince_In_Milan","Null","0","0","8 January 2002"," Somewhat dull
","It's HARD for a film to live up to its studios own hype, so lets give this film a couple of extra points.<br/><br/>And it needs every point it can get. The scripting is lackluster and VERY episodic, the camerawork is rather pedestrian, the special effects are pretty humdrum and the music is dull and ponderous.<br/><br/>The scripting is a rather dull, plodding affair, really. The film IS very faithful to the book, but it's also full of unnecessary detail and one tends to wonder how long the film is going to go on for. Do we really need a scene where the layout of the Hogwarts dormitories is explained? Do we really NEED to be introduced to the School ghosts when they play no part in the subsequent story? What's the point of wasting time on Norbert the dragon when he doesn't really play any part in the story? When halfway through the film they begin talking about the philosopher's stone, I found myself thinking ""THAT'S right... THAT's what this film is about"" but by then I'd lost interest in the whole mess. Worst of all, the film lacks the atmosphere of the book. The book has a real sense of menace throughout and every piece fits in well. This film drags on for the first three quarters and then, finding itself in more familiar Hollywood territory rushes through the last bits.<br/><br/>The camerawork is pretty pedestrian, the film feels SMALL and there is little attempt at introducing a real sense of grandeur in the visuals. The special effects were a bit disappointing, but then again it's HARD to know what a game of Quidditch would really look like. I didn't like the centaurs or the troll at all, they look plastickey and somewhat stilted. Finally, the music belongs in some 1940s Errol Flynn movie. Still, it's nice to see a film with an ACTUAL SCORE rather than a bunch of pop songs thrown together.<br/><br/>Having said ALL that, this film is WAY above the usual kiddie film: it's better than most Walt Disney product, for example, and it's interesting to note that one CAN actually discuss this film in ""grownup terms"". Actually, this film comes out a lot better and with a lot more depth than (say) your usual James Bond film. The story line is more intricate and the characters are richer.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting is not bad, although of course it'd be surprising if such an illustrious cast of British actors couldn't play these roles while standing on their heads.<br/><br/>Anyway, 'nuff said."

","And so the first novel of the children's fantasy series that author J.K. Rowling brought into the world is transformed to visual life for the big screen. Directed by Chris Columbus, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, an 11-year-old who has been living his life thus far with his Muggle aunt, Muggle uncle, and Muggle cousin. See, Muggles are humans that possess no magical abilities. Harry, on the other hand, has found that when he's excited or angry, he is able to do things of a sorcerous nature. One day a mysterious letter arrives, which the Muggle adults endeavor to keep away from him. Harry finally gets his hands on the letter, and discovers that he's been invited to attend a school of wizardry. And it's off to a magical world that he goes.<br/><br/>He begins attending Hogwarts School of Wizardry, where he quickly makes friends with Ron and Hermione (Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, respectively). As he acquaints himself with his surroundings and adjusts to the destiny that he must now accept, he becomes embroiled in a mystery whose consequences, unless thwarted, could spell doom for all of wizarddom. See, there is an evil lord named Voldemort, who seeks the power of immortality via the Sorcerer's Stone, which is kept hidden on the school's property. To make things even more lively, Voldemort is the one who killed Harry's natural parents, and he seeks to do in Harry as well.<br/><br/>I approached this quite aware that the story would, based on its source material, be imaginative and probably charming. But I also knew that Chris Columbus was at the helm -- he's the director of some very, very conventional Hollywood hits, including Home Alone, Bicentennial Man, and Mrs. Doubtfire. Yet, I was willing (as I am with any movie) to let the individual film speak for itself.<br/><br/>And it turns out that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is very good. What works best about it is the non-stop commitment to imagination that is present throughout. Every scene is one of colorful inspiration, in terms of characters, plot developments, and fantastical touches.<br/><br/>The characters are many, and accomplished actors are everywhere. Our three young leads -- Harry and his two friends -- are all very cinematically friendly. They're funny, and they're cute. It's easy to root for these kids, particularly if you're a kid yourself (even one at heart, of course). Unfortunately, a lot of the sideline characters, such as Nearly Headless Nick (John Cleese), Mrs. Weasley (Julie Walters), and Mr. Ollivander (John Hurt), are barely in the movie. Their appearances are little more than cameos.<br/><br/>Many, many scenes throughout the movie (dare I say all of them?) possess a potent creative energy that can be enjoyed during the fact and admired after the fact. The game of Quidditch is a stand-out, reminding me of the speeder bike chase in Return of the Jedi. This sequence is longer than that one, which is probably the reason it seems to work just about as well -- if the effects aren't really wildly new here, they make up for it in length.<br/><br/>And there perhaps lies my main complaint with the film. Cinematically, there's nothing new going on here. Everything is done very well -- and it never sinks to Columbus's brand of schmaltz -- but it's all noticably conventional. No new ground is broken. The effects, the editing, the acting, the cinematography -- all good, but all similar to that which has gone before. Even the score, by John Williams, while enchanting, has a certain déjà vu quality. Of course, none of that will matter to the target audience. And it shouldn't, really.<br/><br/>There you have it. I'm recommending Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Kids are gonna freak over this one. Many, many of tomorrow's adults will be saying, ""You know what my favorite movie was when I was a kid?"" And they'll be saying it was Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I happen to think that the movie's primary virtues stem from the source material, the novel itself. But I give director Chris Columbus credit for being cinematically true to that literary vision.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 8.5/10"

This movie was very faithful in its depiction, but in shortening it for film (and it was already long at 2hr20min) they cut out some of the charm that made the books so endearing: development of supporting characters, little diversionary snippets of storyline, etc. For example, even a character like Neville Longbottom was fully developed in the book -- in the movie he was a mere shadow of his book self.  Same applies to Malfoy and his croonies (who are barely mentioned), many of the professors, and some of the Weasley family, to name a few.

They really do deserve the return on their investment after demonstrating such faith in its success.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus has shown an unexpected abundance of flair in understanding the British setting, filming a complex revered book, and living up to the massive global hype. Can this really be the director that used to bring us dirge like Home Alone 2? This is the biggest turn-around since Volkswagen bought Skoda. Wow."
"SMK-4","8","0","0","30 December 2001"," Great ambience, but not a perfect film
","The film captures very well the required ambience, it does not appear phony as so many genre rivals do. The set pieces are marvellous. Robbie Coltrane makes a perfect Haggrit and generally the casting is fine, except perhaps Ian Hart as Quirrel; I also would have chosen someone younger than Maggie Smith for the McGonagall part, say Haydn Gwynne.<br/><br/>However, the film is too long.  It tries to juggle too many balls, keep too many plot elements and characters from the book [which I read _after_ seeing the film] - and there just is not enough room for it, not even in a two-and-a-half hour long movie.  As a result, some characters (notably Draco Malfoy) remain underdeveloped and some elements (e.g. Quidditch) which add weight to the whole school experience as the book brings it across are reduced to the bare minimum for the purposes of the story and consequently increase the predictability of the plot.<br/><br/>Bigger sacrifices should have been made to focus on depth rather than breadth.  For example, one might have scrapped the school cup altogether."

","This is a much subtler movie...while it might seem episodic...it moves along at a clipping pace.  The actors are marvellous (as others have noted; bouquets to Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith and Hagrid and young 'arry). They had depth -- something not evident in the LOTR characters.  The graphics were great perhaps not as subtle as LOTR.  At least we weren't bombarded with countless (bad) battle scenes.  I disagree with other reviewers who felt this was more childish than LOTR (which I thought brimmed with mawkish sentimentality and posturing).  Those poms can sure act.

","When I first heard that they were making this into a movie I groaned, how on earth could a movie be anywhere near as good as the book?  I really didn't want to see it, but my dad (yes my dad!) wanted to go so I went with. I was pleasantly surprised, the movie was delightful.<br/><br/>     For the most part the casting was good (2 grievances:  I pictured Prof. McGonagall to be fortyish-so I thought Maggie Smith was a little old for the part-she did a fine job though; and Rickman wasn't quite how I'd pictured Snape).  The cinematography and scenery were beautiful.  Like a lot of fans of the books I was pointing out things that were different or had been left out, but the changes didn't hurt the movie.  The movie didn't really drag at all, in fact when we were leaving the theatre I looked at my watch and couldn't believe that it had been over 2 hours.  Nowadays movies run about 90 minutes, but I honestly couldn't tell it was a longer movie.<br/><br/>     Seeing the movie made me want to re-read the books and I did so. Hopefully those who haven't already read them will want to once they've seen the film.  And the books aren't just for kids (especially the last one which has several scenes that deal with torture and murder, among other things). I'm in my twenties and my dad is almost sixty and we both thoroughly enjoyed the books and he even enjoyed the movie more than I.  Go see it (with or without your kids!)."

","It took me a while to warm up to the whole Harry Potter-hysteria, and so far I've only read the first book. But if the rest of the series is anywhere near as good as ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" (yes, I've read the British version), I can't wait to get my hands on it.<br/><br/>As for the film, it's a very faithful adaption of the novel. Director Columbus has not strayed far from J.K. Rowling's plotlines, which works very well for me. I have to agree, though, with some of the other reviewers, that some of the ""magic feeling"" of the book is gone from the film. That said, it's still a great movie. The actors do a very fine job indeed, particularly the three young protagonists (with Rupert Grint/Ron as my personal favourite). Daniel Radcliffe does well as Harry, particularly considering that in the book, we get to know very much about him through his thoughts and feelings, which are not so easily conveyed on the big screen. The only funny thing about Radcliffe is the way his voice changes throughout the film (down - up - down again). But I guess that is the danger of working with pre-pubescent boys anyway... The ""adult"" cast is - as expected - outstanding, and very well suited for their characters (you just have to love Rickman as Snape...). The special effects are well done (and not overdone). The Quidditch game was especially spectacular, as well as the moving stairs and Fluffy the dog.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a wonderful movie for children of all ages. I give it a very strong 5 (out of 6) on my dice, and recommend it to everyone!"

Also, this is one movie where the SFX crew really were wizards.<br/><br/>The actors all performed marvellously.  The standouts in my mind were Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, and (surprisingly) Sean Biggerstaff as Oliver Wood.<br/><br/>The script was also excellent, hewing very close to the book.

"lmitrani","8","0","0","3 January 2002"," Imaginative Enactment of Classic with Impressive Special Effects & Fine Storytelling.
","The long anticipated Harry Potter has something for everyone.  Fans of the book, which I did not read, are treated to what I understand is a faithful reproduction of the text.  Although people like me will not know about muggles, hogwarts, goblins, wizards, elves and Sorcerer's Stones, that disadvantage can be overcome.  The wide range of villains and obstacles for our heroes to conquer will satisfy adventure fans.  The unusual number of surprises and defiances of convention should delight magic aficionados. Admirers of good performing will appreciate the ensemble acting of Harry Potter (Dan Radcliffe) and classmates Ronald (Rupert Grint) and especially Hermione (Emma Watson II).  Veteran actors Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, John Hurt and John Cleese ably support them.  Feminists will appreciate how Hermione takes charge in critical moments in an effort to rescue her male companions.  She does it with brains and wizardry rather than force and violence.  I admire her spunk. <br/><br/> There are two spectacular sequences, one involving an air game resembling hockey and the other a chess match with violence at every move.  Other special effects -- involving wizardry, secret passages and unusual adversaries like giant creatures and three-headed dogs -- keep the audience at the edge of its seat.  The castle that houses the school campus is itself a sight to behold with forbidden chambers, fascinating architecture and lively student body and faculty.   Of course, there is the classic battle between good and evil, but many characters have elements of both.  Action scenes are plentiful, but not to the extent that character development and plot are neglected.  The fast pace ensures that no one will be bored, although the multitude of characters with weird names and obscure powers (e.g. potion making, levitation) is sometimes hard to follow.  In short, Harry Potter is not groundbreaking, but a fun movie that knows how to pace itself and end on cue.  It tells a good story and allows our imaginations, often constrained since childhood, to flourish again.<br/><br/> It's suitable for children and adults.  Despite some violence, there's no profanity, nudity or anything offensive for younger eyes.  However, it may be too intense for children under six.  Adults can also enjoy this as escapist entertainment not unlike an Indiana Jones movie.  At my showing at 6:30 in the evening, all viewers were grown-ups.  I look forward to the sequel."

Of course a lot had to be left out to keep the movie under 6 hours.  The deletions were quite acceptable to me.  There was not a major character or scene that was omitted.  All movies made from books disappoint a little (or a lot); they just cannot be as good as a book by the nature of the medium (audio/visual representations)as opposed to the limitless possibilites of the human mind and imagination.  Some movies do a very good job of representing what the mind imagined; this one did a fair to good job of it.<br/><br/>I would recommend the movie unequivocally."

","Pros: Does justice to the book; excellent acting; good special effects.<br/><br/>Cons: Not suitable for very young children; confusing storyline for those who haven't read the book(s).<br/><br/>
Need I write about the plot, when all four of the Harry Potter books have done so well and have been devoured by children and adults alike? To briefly enlighten those of you who, for some reason, (weren't you at least curious???) haven't even opened a Harry Potter book...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Harry Potter is an 11-year-old orphan who is admitted into the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, mostly because his parents, who were killed by an evil magician when he was a baby, graduated from there.<br/><br/>Each book of the series focuses on one academic year in the life of young Harry. The reader 'grows' with the character.<br/><br/>The first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, is more of an introduction than a book on its own, a sketch, rather than a complete painting. That is why, in my opinion at least, it shouldn't have been made into a movie in the first place. You would think a 2 1/2 hour-long adaptation should be sufficient. But it's not. Although it does justice to the book, especially in the portrayal of the characters (they're exactly as you would picture them to be!), it skips out many parts of the book. And since the book itself wasn't 'complete', how can you expect a movie adaptation to be completely fulfilling? I think the movie is almost incomprehensible to most of those who haven't read, not the book, but the entire series! The beginning must have puzzled them a great deal, and the ending was obviously rushed. The details revolving around the sorcerer's stone itself don't translate well from page to screen. Too many questions are left unanswered. And the satirical fun that made the books such an entertaining read was almost absent in the film.<br/><br/>I can't stress enough on how fine the children's performance was. Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter, at least physically he is. His expressions are very convincing. Unfortunately, director Chris Columbus doesn't allow his 'inner' feelings to surface much, except in one scene when Harry discovers a magical mirror that reflects one's deepest desires. It is only then that we feel Harry's pain for the loss of his parents. Also, the director doesn't succeed much in portraying Harry's miserable life when he is staying with his aunt, uncle and his fat cousin Dudley. In the book, he is the main character because we are allowed into his confused, painful, and sometimes happy feelings, in the movie he is the main character mostly because the title says so. Rupert Grint, who plays Ron, Harry's first and closest friend at school (my favorite character, actually!) was simply magnificent. His mimics when he is scared or confused are just adorable! Emma Watson (the slightly irritating but studious and audacious Hermione) was remarkable in her 'show-off' scenes. The adult characters were fine, but what is more important is that none of the kids were annoying or whiny.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named/Lord Voldemort though. The magician gave me the chills in the books, but was almost unnoticeable in the film. You would say: ""What??? THAT killed Harry Potter's parents? THAT is terrorizing the entire community of magicians that they wouldn't even speak out his name? Puhleeeeeeze! Even a kid watching this wouldn't feel the 'threat' of the character.""<br/><br/>
The hair and makeup were very well done, especially on Hermione, the gatekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (an almost unrecognizable Richard Harris, folks!) and all of the female professors. The creatures however, especially the Centaur and the Goblin, looked very fake. Even the centaurs in Xena and Hercules looked more credible, for as much as a mythological character can look real anyway. ;)<br/><br/>The effects involving the indoors of Hogwarts were surprisingly fantastic. I was impressed with the ghosts and the 'active' characters in the paintings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The setting was great! Hogwarts is THE fantasy place to be; a medieval castle with almost limitless proportions, moving staircases, elegant dormitories with vivid colors...And mouthwatering, well presented dishes for meals, folks! In contrast, the Black Forest has a dark and terrifying ambience, with predominant black and dark blue colors, as well as the inevitable thick mist.<br/><br/>
The soundtrack was fantastic; it provided a suitable background for the 'suspenseful' and 'witchy' parts of the movie. However, I could swear I heard an adaptation of the Wedding March in some scenes! Odd...<br/><br/>I'll lighten up now, and conclude by saying that the overall movie was quite enjoyable, entertaining, etc.etc. Suitable for both children (not too young though, some scenes might scare them!) and adults. You will not get bored. But you might get confused. And it might leave you slightly unsatisfied.<br/><br/>
Your answer to this would be: ""Hey, be thankful that the book had material for at least 8 hours of film, yet it had been compressed into a 2 hour-and-a-half flick."" Well then, why make this into a movie at all? Why not make this into a mini-series? That would surely be a success. Every season will cover one of the books. And, as a series, it would seem perfectly normal if many questions were left unanswered during a few episodes."

They may have picked him for his looks but not for his star power. They really blew the casting for Harry in my opinion. There were some very good scenes but even the showstopper Quidditch match and the chess match was rushed and boring.  The scene in the forest was very good but again short. The finale I enjoyed but for some reason I kept expecting Voldewort to tell Harry he was his father.....hmmm, Ive seen that somewhere before though. Anyway. This movie gets a 7 from me just because of the attempt, stunning although cold sets and a couple of decent performances from the adults. This franchise is destined to make Billions in hype alone.

The experience of Harry seeing the magical world was seeing him finding everything new, wonderful, amazing yet somehow right, the way things should be, the place he belonged.<br/><br/>Many people have been comparing Harry Potter to Lord of the Rings.  This is not a proper comparison.  Harry Potter is on a much smaller scale while LOTR is an epic.  You may as well compare Citizen Kane to Lawrence of Arabia.<br/><br/>This is a movie I would happily recommend.  It is the first well done complete fantasy I have ever seen (Star Wars isn't fantasy ... and Indiana Jones is but in a different way).

","first of all, a warm of applause for Christ Columbus for trying his very best to be faithful as possible to the book.<br/><br/>Now for the comments: I understood that it is obvious that some scenes might be cut or added on the movie if it's a book. There were several characters, scenes and minor whatsits not included in the film. For example is the Potions scene where Hermione amazingly answer the logic riddle. Peeves, an important character to take part of the mischief of Harry Potter. and who knows what else.

But it should be added that I´m not a huge fan of the book, I read it and thought it was good, but I couldn´t really understand all the attention it has been given. But I have to say that Chris Columbus has created an excellent adaption, that includes the very best parts of the story and also remains faithful to J.K Rowling´s book. It has the same nice details as the book and it actually takes its time to develop the characters. The effects are mostly top-notch and the set-pieces are awesome. The climax is definitely the Quidditch match, this was made to be seen on the big screen!<br/><br/>If you think of how many child actors we have here, the acting is sensational! Daniel Radcliffe is perfect and just as I imagined Harry. However, he is easily outshined by ginger-haired Rupert Grint, who plays young comedian Ron Weasly, who provides the most laughs. But the real discovery of the kids is Emma Watson as bossy Hermione. You could tell after one minute of Ms Watson that she will be huge in the future! The older actors are perfectly cast as well. Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith are solid, while Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt provide warmth.<br/><br/>The movie´s few problems is its length, I definitely don´t agree with those who thought it was to short. It loses tempo towards the end, and the finale is a disappointment. Another problem is that the book is not without its flaws from the very beginning. You could forgive it since it takes more than half of the movie to introduce the characters and the environments. Because after that comes a cheap story about a ""Philosopher´s Stone"" that feels relatively uninteresting. But you have to remember that this is the first episode of a long series.

","I saw this film at the first showing on opening day, not because it excited me THAT much but because my friend paid.  I had read all the books not because I love that kind of book, but because I had a few long plane rides. My attitude toward this whole Harry Potter phenomenon is that it's a great way to get kids to read; the books are fun, but I don't think any of it reason for excitement.  So the movie version, in my opinion, should bring something really special, after all it is a scapegoat from reading the books.  <br/><br/>I was disappointed, however, to find that it was no more (nor less, mind) than it needed to be.  <br/><br/>Director Chris Columbus, I am sure, was not an exciting choice for the producers.  He has no style to speak of, which is appropriate, but boring. I don't expect the project to be handed to Darren Aronofsy, but it needed a little more ""magic,"" if you will, behind the camera.<br/><br/>The effects were not disturbingly bad, but I for one am bored with computer effects.  Animatronics are getting better just as are cgi effects, so maybe a few more of those could have replaced some of the more obvious cgi's.<br/><br/>The acting was fine, not great, except in the cases of Richard Harris as Dumbledore and the boy who played Draco Malfoy, the evil student.  Those two are examples of exceptional acting.<br/><br/>The screenplay was generally loyal to the book.  But as in Most instances of a book translation to film, the occasional interesting subplot must be sacrificed and some elements and characters that were truly vivid in the book are cut down to become vague plot catalysts such as Hagrid's character and the whole Sorcerer's (or Philosopher's) Stone wrap up.<br/><br/>Was I completely let down?  No.  It was a refresher course for the book since I read it a while ago.  But by no means should it be an alternative to the book.  I know kids are going to go ape poopy over it because there really isn't anything in it to let them down unless they are really snobby kids.  I was just disappointed because I'm a snobby viewer."

","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is one of the best pictures of all time, but yes the best adaptation of all time.

I didn't expect it to be so escelent, I was a fan of teh books but I was afraid of the movie, but now I am also a fan of the movie. I went to saw it whit my familie (we were 12) and we all came out of the theater happy because this film cause that, happines. The movie has a magic, friendship, darknes and happines that is not usual in the films tha we used to see. I must sais that I was no dissapointed with the film but yes surprised. I think that this film is the best in something: adaptation, because I read the book for second time a week before it comes to theaters and I think that in the film they respect the book perfectly, so I put to Harry Potter an the Philosopher Stone a 10, so don't listen to the stupids that said that is wrong because you are losing a future classic."

","I'll admit it; I'm a teenager and have read every one of the ""Harry Potter"" books several times over. I love J.K. Rowling's subtle, sarcastic wit and clever story-telling, which was completely missing from this movie.<br/><br/>
""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a beautifully made movie that fails to involve the viewer. It skims over the best parts of the books, which are, sadly, the smallest and most minute details that apparently didn't seem important enough to garner screen time. Case in point: the Weasley twins. Fred and George provide the most entertaining comic relief in the books, and were barely mentioned in the movie, let alone shown. Except for the Quidditch scene, of course. The tiny nuances of Rowling's writing can't be shown on the big screen, and so the film cannot compare to reading the series.<br/><br/>Another qualm I had with it was the fact that Cris Columbus focused mainly on making ""Sorcerer's Stone"" a child-oriented action flick. If they had spent more time working with the actors, who were, by the way, very good with the small parts allotted them, I might have been more moved.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. Some parts were excellent, such as Diagon Alley. The casting was well done; the children work well with each other and the adults all fit their characters' descriptions to the nines. But I thought it was predictable (obviously) and plodding, completely lacking any inspiration. I'm hoping, for the audience's sake, that the makers of ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" find the magic that makes the books the marvels they are."

","I'm one of the obsessed HP fans, I want to say that the books are much better than the movie even though I've seen the movie on CD that i bought for like hundreds of times but the director cut to many interesting and important parts. For example like Harry's 2nd quidditch game with Prof. Snape as the ref. and they didn't show how Harry took Norbert up to the tower to give it to Charlie and got detention for that. And how Harry gave trouble and made the whole school not wanting to talk to him until he won 2nd quidditch match. I would really love the movie if the director followed exactly like in the books even though if it's for like 10 hours :-P For example, like movies based on stephen king's novel, say, the movie ""IT"" about the clown, it's long aint it? But we have the satisfaction of watching it.<br/><br/>The actors, Harry, Ron and all other actors were really good except Hermione was just a LIL bit overacting, I mean the way she talks that is. =) Of course Hogwarts was a creation of a genius and the quidditch is fun! But the special effects were amazing as in the mountain troll part and quidditch.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give 3 1/2 out of 5. Altho coz of the cute actors ;-) esp.

It's guaranteed to outlive the accuracy police who worry that details may be lost in the adaptation. <br/><br/>It is said, in general, that ""the book is always better than the film."" But when's the last time you heard anyone say that about The Wizard of Oz? The same should be true for HP. So why do we look down on film adaptations as tawdry 'Hollywoodised' versions? If someone wrote a ballet based on the Harry Potter story, it would be senseless to say that it was better than the book.

"dileepa","Null","0","0","21 December 2001"," So religiously faithful to the book that it fails
","I REALLY tried to enjoy this movie but it just didn't happen. Perhaps I got too caught up in the unneccessary hype but in that case I think that reviewers and critics alike got caught up too much in the same stuff, so much caught up were they that they didn't really see this film for how bland it really was. Had this been a kids fantasy film released without the unneccessary baggage it would have recieved a whole string of 5s out of 10 as opposed to the sometimes insanely brilliant reviews critics accorded it.<br/><br/>To put it succintly the special effects were average (come on! compare it to the most modern of films and you will realise that you were shortchanged, only the quidditch match came close to modern special effects standards), the set pieces were good, the acting cast underperformed, the cinematography was also average, the story was reasonable though it stuck so religiously to the book that people who had read the book beforehand would not have been surprised at all by the storyline (and the Harry Potter plot in the book is designed to actually surprise you) and the same goes for the satirical gimmicks which are exactly the same as in the book.<br/><br/>If I had simply watched the movie and simply not read the book perhaps I would have given this movie a higher rating but I didn't and so there were absolutely no surprises in it for me, except disappointment at the parts left out.<br/><br/>The performances were uninspired and featured no originality, almost all character types played you've seen before. The exceptions are Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman and the child actors (excluding the kid that plays Harry Potter). These characters were original but Robbie Coltrane's character was underused. He only really takes part in a few minutes of film and his character is given some space to grow but then Chris Columbus shuts him off again to focus more on the bland, overcliched characters. The young actress who plays Hermoine did a good job, as did the orange haired actor that played Potter's friend (can't remember the name off the top of my head!) and of course in an otherwise bland film Alan Rickman adds more colour (as Robbie Coltrane has done) as an evil (or is he?) schoolteacher Snape.<br/><br/>You'll wonder with all the characters I've named displaying good performances how this movie could possibly be average. The answer probably lies in the structure of the story which doesn't differ from the book at all, even to provide a more cinema-suited experience thus young fans (my 11 year old sister, an avid Potter fan, thought the movie quite bad) will be bored to death by a movie which is exactly the same as the book they read. Why spend more money for a pop-up picture book when you've got the paperback at home?<br/><br/>The biggest complaints with this movie however (and also with regards to its structure) is that it is far too long! 2 and a half hours may be half an hour shorter than Titanic or Lord of The Rings: Fellowship of the Ring but those movies have complex story and character development to occupy the three hours, Harry Potter is a childrens movie with characters that do not change at all throughout the film (as you would expect from a childrens movie), therefore it does not have anything to fill the extra hour (the film should really have been 1 and a half hours) and as such it drags on to the point where it nears a coma-induction stage. At one point I was checking my watch every five minutes!<br/><br/>Sure, this movie is faithful to the book but with average acting, average special effects, a predictable plot and an overlong running time is this movie really faithful to the magic and spirit of the book?"

"Willow192","Null","0","0","28 December 2001"," Good, but doesn't live up to all of the hype
","Unfortunately, I can't say that I've read any of the books.  Although I've heard only good things about them.  I can, however, comment on what I saw today.  Harry Potter is not what all of the critics make it out to be.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either.<br/><br/>First of all, I'm glad that Chris Columbus actually caste British actors with authentic accents.  Nothing drives me crazier than watching a 2 and Â½ hour movie hearing an American actor trying to sound British.  Another plus is getting an unknown actor to play Harry.  Daniel Radcliff's career has skyrocketed because of this one movie.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have complained about Daniel Radcliffe's acting.  I thought he did a fairly good job.  He didn't seem to be under acting to me.  Maybe I am being naive because I have never read any of the books.  But it seems to me that people are looking at the movie compared to the book more than just the movie for what it was.<br/><br/>I thought all of the actors did wonderful jobs.  I can really see Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint having flourishing acting careers.  They were flawless except for a couple of scenes at the end where Grint is overacting to the point of sheer annoyance.  <br/><br/>Without a doubt, the best performance was Alan Rickman's.  He didn't get many speaking parts but when he did he was perfect.  And he made up for the talking he didn't do with his facial expressions.  Maggie Smith was also very good.<br/><br/>One problem I had with the movie was the cheesy CGI effects that were scene in the battle with the troll, and just about all of the scenes involving flying on broomsticks.  The scenes didn't look real at all. It had me wondering why they even bothered, or why they didn't make the whole movie CGI.  The scene where all of the boats were floating into the school for the first time was very beautiful.  (But if they had we wouldn't have been able to see Alan Rickman playing Severus Snape now would we ?*sigh*)  The talking hat also gave me a headache.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW<br/><br/>The end of the movie was where it started to fall downhill.  For instance, why didn't they better secure the door where the stone was actually hidden? If a 10 year old girl can open the door what would make them think that a stronger and more experienced wizard would have a hard time.  The same is true with the vines after they get past the three headed dog.<br/><br/>The chess scene should not have even been in the movie at all.  This is where Grint became a little too overdramatic for my liking.  A couple of questions popped into my mind while I was watching this: 1)	Why is there is a huge chess board on the way to the stone?  What smarty thought this thing up? 2)	Why did Grint have to mount a horse to play the game?  Couldn't he have stood on the side and yelled out commands? 3)	Why did Harry and Hermione have to be pieces?  Why weren't there enough pieces to play the game on their side?  And suppose there were only 2 people there instead of 3?<br/><br/>Then in the ending when `he who shall not be named' goes through Harry's body and knocks him unconscious, why didn't he grab the stone?  Why would he go through all of that trouble, have the opportunity, and then fail to grab it and fly out of the room.  I heard that the ending was seriously altered to better accommodate the movie.  So that must have been one of the changes from the book.<br/><br/>So all in all Harry Potter was pretty decent.  It had a couple of flaws but not enough to bring the movie down entirely.  The actors were great and the screen play wasn't the worst that it could have been."

","The cinematography was *amazing* and I'm not usually one to comment on it. The costuming, sets, and make-up were phenomenal as well.  The snake scene, Quidditch, chess scenes, and moving portraits were just awesome (watch the pictures in the background during the infirmary scene!)<br/><br/>Walking away from the movie, my favorites were actually different than the book.  In the book, I liked Hermione.  In the movie, I wanted to bat her senseless with a nerf bat for the overkill attitude.  However, that could be due to either the lines, or Emma Watson's lack of acting background (which was extremely obvious in that she sometimes had to pause to remember a line, looked a bit startled when it came to her turn, and was a bit forced).  She didn't quite look like what I thought, nor did Dumbledore.<br/><br/>I *LOVED* the characters of Ron, Madame Hooch, and Hagrid (Hagrid I liked in the book as well).  Rupert Grint did an absolutely phenomenal job with the character of Ron, and was an incredible asset to the movie!  Madame Hooch just looked very cool, much spiffier than I thought.  Robbie Coltrane did a fantastic job as Hagrid as well, with a running comment that always evoked laughs from the audience.  Rickman as Snape and Maggie Smith as McGonagal was pure genius!  They were the epitome of the characters... Rickman playing Snape even better than I'd imagined the character!!<br/><br/>The only down side to the movie is that one section of the climax was dropped so it didn't make sense considering the alluding to a teacher's (Snape) help throughout the movie.  And, even though I'd read the books, I felt like I missed something with how it jumped from the chess scene to the mirror.  The good aspects far outweighed the bad, however!"

","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (or Sorcerer's Stone) entertains and remains with the audience after the mere ""pop-corn experience"". Basically the movie is a very pleasing delight and it is magnified more so by the lack of quality movies in the summer (and early fall) of 2001. This (perhaps), along with the huge following of the books, led to its huge opening and then rather precipitous collapse at the box office.<br/><br/>Coming into the movie with no pretenses (i.e. 1:Not comparing it to The Phantom Menace (with is a good movie, but has flaws) or any other movie. 2: Not expecting Titanic-like box office numbers (Titanic was based off of a true event that entrals us, Potter is just great fantasy) 3:Not expecting anything specific out-of-it as I did not read the book beforehand and did not research into the characters before viewing)<br/><br/>I was very pleased. The casting is very good, with Hagrid and some of the older/wiser wizards topping the charts. I was a tad surprised that some name actors (or at least known actors had very small roles: Warwick Davis and Cleese to name a couple), and I for the most part like the use of special effects to enhance the story rather than override it (like most of the 2001 summer movies did).<br/><br/>The movie though is not perfect.<br/><br/>1-Some special effects shots are mind blowing (i.e. the candles at the dinner hall), but others are rediculously fake looking (mainly when kids are swinging wildly from trolls or brooms).<br/><br/>2-Some of the cuts just dont make sense. (i.e. when some of the kids get in trouble for having tea with Hagrid, Why do they get in trouble for being with Hagrid, his property is not off of school grounds? There is no basis for it).<br/><br/>Afterwards, I read the book and for the most part the movie is very faithful, yet--><br/><br/>The movie also looses some of its magic in the last half, when it cuts out parts to quicken the story. More on the dragon would have been great, the other 2 challenges would have been good, and even only a few more minutes to clarify the current challenges would be better. Also, some of the differences seem to be made just for the sake of change, (i.e the movie and the book have some of the same punishments and rewards, but the points are changed).<br/><br/>However, the movie still entertains. The qualms are really just minor issues, but they do keep the first of 7 Harry Potter movies from being truely great. Instead its just really good and that ""ain't"" half bad."

I couldn't help but compare the two, but Harry Potter was fun, even though I found the young actor VERY wooden. Why did the director tolerate the soulless smiling and lifeless eyes from young Daniel?  It's as if they were looking for that exact factor in the title role. He seemed like he was totally intimidated by the project he was involved with. He started to warm up toward the end, and unlike most films, Harry Potter got better as it rolled along.

Minus a few details, the movie was very close to the book...For what was there. They skipped a LOT os scenes, which is excusable, I mean, it was nearly 3 hrs as it was. One of my biggest complaints was the Visual Effects. When ever they made a character or creature completely out of Special Effects it looked horribly fake. The Ogre, Cenatour, Fluffy, Nobert, Voldermort all looked horrible. The Scorpion king form The Mummy Returns looked better then they did. I supose they weren't so bad, but after seeing Final Fantasy and movies like that, I can't help thinking of how much better they could of done them. But not all of the effects looked horrible, in fact some were spectacular, like Quidditch. It was so well done, it made me smile with gratification while watching it. The special effects, the choreography, everything was perfect. I was also very impressed by Hogwarts. The art design and special effects were stunning, esspecially when the paintings moved, very well done. I was also highly impressed by the camera work and directing of the film.

","Let the magic begin.  That is the tagline to Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.  The tagline is, for once, perfectly fitting.  Harry Potter is a 152-minute coming of age epic, and entails your basic good versus evil theme.  The script is penned by Steven Kloves, based upon the novel by J. K. Rowling.  Kloves other accomplishments include the Fabulous Baker Boys, and last years wonderful picture Wonder Boys.  Director Chris Columbus is certainly not a new face to the Hollywood scene, but is not that well known. Columbus has Home Alone, Ms. Doubtfire, and Step Mom under his belt, so do not expect a poor effort.  Harry Potter also brings newcomer Daniel Radcliffe to the title role.  He previously had a minor role in the TV movie David Copperfield, and was also in The Tailor of Panama.  While not an experienced actor, Radcliffe is so young and unaware of the entire Hollywood scene, that he delivers charm, and charisma beyond his years.<br/><br/>I for one have not read any of the Potter books.  This, in my opinion, is a good thing.  From what I have read, though, Columbus has remained almost flawlessly faithful to the book.  Also, as I was leaving the cinema I overheard several children saying, `That is exactly how I imagined it.'  For fans of the book, this is definitely a good thing. 	 Harry is an orphan boy who is delivered to his aunt and uncle's house when he is merely an infant.  He will remain here until he is old enough to become a wizard.  It is then that he will attend Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  When Harry reaches the age of eleven, he is sent a letter.  The letter contains an invitation to attend the school.  He accepts and is on his way to becoming a wizard.  The story then progresses and follows his maturation into a young man. 	 This movie contains a little bit of everything.  This is probably an attempt by Columbus to open up even more people to the world of Harry Potter.  There is a cute, yet innocent love story that will probably develop into something further down the line, along with a little bit of action for the easily amused.  There is a touch of suspense before the evil sorcerer is revealed. After tense scenes, Columbus reassures us everything will be all right with a joke thrown in here and there.  Yet, at times we feel sad, and out of place, because of the fact that Harry is an orphan, and often quite lonely. It is certainly a roller coaster ride, that in the end, makes you want to get right back on, and go again. 	 I can almost guarantee that this movie will shake some people the wrong way because of the excessive use of computer-generated images.  Most people tend to like solid and concrete images over computer generated ones.  I disagree. Columbus needed to use the aid of computers to help him construct his image of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  Anything less would leave the audience disappointed.  The CGI complements the movie in such a way that it feels as though you are fighting an ogre, or flying along with Harry on his broom.  The CGI is in no way distracting.  It is quite beneficial and pertinent to the story. The performances are not perfect, but often great.  As a newcomer, Daniel Radcliffe does an exceptional job at portraying Harry.  There is no doubt though, that he will disappoint many.  Those being die hard fans of the book.  One actor that always delivers, yet goes unnoticed is Alan Rickman. Alan plays Professor Severus Snape, and is quite successful at being evil and deceptive.  Rupert Grint plays Ron Weasley, along with Emma Watson as Hermione Granger.  Weasley is as delightful to watch as Radcliffe.  Weasley can be seen as the comic relief of the movie.  His constant obnoxious faces bring about a small smirk.  Watson the other hand seems to over act at times.  It is probably because of her inexperience, that she performs this way.  Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore is also quite a treat. His last performance was as the great Emperor Marcus Aurelius in Gladiator. Harry Potter is not a movie for all audiences.  It is geared more towards the younger generations.  Although, the highlight of the movie will no doubt be found in the Quiddich scene.  The story is quite simple, but delivers on a grand scale.  The characters are a delight to watch, and it is quite extraordinary to see Daniel Radcliffe perform so well.  Some may be disappointed by some of its childish nature, but I urge everyone to give it a chance, and be a part of movie making history.  <br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","I can't entirely agree with kylopod (kylopod@aol.com) that the movie doesn't completely do the book the justice it needs.  To me, the movie never ""dragged"" at points, but was seamless.  The book on the otherhand was boring for quite a bit of it.  The Quidditch scenario was much more interesting on film than on paper (although I would have liked the speech given by Wood to his team in the film; but certain cuts must be made I guess).<br/><br/>I think the movie is great for anybody whether or not you've read the books. If you're a die-hard for the books you are probably going to be upset--yet I just can't see why for the life of me.

Oh and good idea to set up a menacing villain like Rickman only to have him become a good guy....not. <br/><br/>Frankly i could do with the two and a half hours back please. :-(<br/><br/>* out of ****"

","Being a big fan of the Harry Potter books, I was very excited when I first heard they were making a movie a little over a year ago. Failing to be able to get tickets on opening night, I saw it the next night, and preceded to see it 2 more times. Let me just say, if you loved the books, you'll love the movie! Even if you haven't read the books, you'll most likely love the experience that is Harry Potter. Though lacking some character development and some satire of the book, Columbus made a wonderful adaption of the already cult classic.<br/><br/>
The storyline is simple enough, Harry is living with his horrible aunt and uncle and spoiled cousin Dudley, until letters start arriving from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Despite Uncle Vernon's strong believes in anti-magic, Harry goes to Hogwarts, and the story unravels from there.<br/><br/>
Wonderful, suspenseful, captivating. Daniel Radcliffe didn't do the greatest acting job, but everyone else in the movie was absolutely perfect, esp. Snape and Dumbledore. Terrific casting for Ron and Hermione, they couldn't have been better. In the future we can expect great things from them.<br/><br/>The special effects could have been a bit better, but overall, this is an awesome movie that everyone should see. A great DVD buy no matter what. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and Columbus makes sure to stay true to the book. Fans of all ages will be spell-binded by Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone!"

","After reading a bit of the book, and being totally enthralled with Rowling's witty and silly sense of humour, I can see why some who are fans of the book can think Colombus's celluloid interpretation is a bit diluted. Nevertheless, there is no fault in watering down the hijinx and hilarity of the three Gryffindor adventurers.  How many people would have stayed in the theater if the Hogwarts Sorting Hat had, as it did in the book, broken into a musical number?<br/><br/>Forget the campy effects and the somewhat messy directing.  The movie belongs to the young actors, who deliver the cinematic snitch, and make Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger come alive with true magic."

"lividemerald","Null","0","0","19 December 2001"," Didn't make any sense to me!
","I have not read the Harry Potter books. I generally enjoyed the movie, but a lot of things made no sense to me. Why was the stone removed from the vault? How did Flamel lose the stone? Was Voldemort or the stammering teacher actually Flamel? If not, then why mention Flamel is going to die once the stone has been destroyed? Why have an elaborate system of defenses and booby-traps (Fluffy, the vines, the giant chess game, the flying keys, etc.) to protect a stone that just appears in your pocket, anyway? I assume those defenses are to protect the stone from bad guys, but where is the stone hidden? The movie does not make that clear. Why was the mirror, easily accessible before, suddenly moved by Dumbledor to this hard-to-access place? Why would kids be punished with a detention (which means locked up, not set free!) to the dark forest where evil lurks, and death is almost certain? Isn't that like putting someone on death row for going 45 mph in a 25 mph zone? In Quidditch, why even bother with putting the balls through the hoops if all you need to do is catch the little glitch ball to win the game? Why is the wand Harry gets so special?---he almost never uses it, anyway! Why is there such an inexplicable gap in the film near the end . . . where Harry, having recovered the stone, suddenly finds himself in bed. Who found the kids? Was Harry taken back unconscious? Did they run out of movie film? Why did Harry have a lightning bolt scar on his forehead? It is not explained how it got there, or why. Why must the giant chess game be commanded from the knight's horse, thus putting Weasely in danger? How do the chess pieces move around, considering all the rubble on the board?  And a million more questions!<br/><br/>Maybe the book is logical and fully details everything. But the movie makes no sense at all for anyone who hasn't read the book. I was disappointed by some of the plot ideas, and some of the use of old standard mythology. I did like the wall with the moving bricks, the moving staircases, and the flying keys. But nothing much else. Even the much-heralded Quidditch game wasn't all that great to see---and the rules didn't make any sense anyway.<br/><br/>Unless all the answers are in the film, and I somehow failed to see them, this movie is a disaster for non-readers of JK Rowling."

","I attended a press screening of HPATSS, a week before the general public, in a theatre full of other press and their families. As I left the theatre, I heard lots of rumblings. Mostly positive. Some of which annoyed me enough to write this now... <br/><br/>Right off the bat, let me express that I'm angered that a movie was made in the first place. Finally kids and adults around the world were reading, loving reading, and using/rediscovering their imaginations. Now instead of picturing Hogwarts in their heads, we all see in our heads the same visualized Hogwarts, Harry, etc...  But a film was shot, and can't be ignored, so - that said, allow me to get to the film:<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie. Easily one of the years best, and sure to be a classic (It's no Memento, but that's ok). As a former Nickelodeon employee, I felt it was my responsibility years ago to read what everyone in that demographic had already read - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I found the book to be incredible, and couldn't wait for the Chamber of Secrets. In any event, I'm a huge fan of the books, of which I've read all of them more than once. I figured if any one could find fault with a HP movie, it would be me. After all, I'm a a critical person, a film school graduate, and a huge Harry Potter fan. I can't find much fault in the movie though. The only critique I have for it is that it felt unbalanced.<br/><br/>
My real beef though is with the rumblings that the book is better. I'm constantly hearing it. Of course the books are better. I agree, full heartedly. The book(s) are great. Full of detail, fun, adventure. But comparing the two is unfair. A movie has a limited amount of time/space to tell it's tale. A book can always add a page, a scene, a detail. I must have heard ""they left the _________ scene out of the movie"" a dozen times. What an annoying criticism. If they shot every scene of the book, the movie would run 4 hours at least. Why is it so hard for us to just sit back and enjoy a really fun movie, without looking for fault? There's so much to be appreciated in the movie, and perhaps most importantly I think we can all appreciate that it's possible this movie will encourage more people to read the books, and just read in general."

Then the movie falls into the trap of displaying special effects for no reason and thinking this makes a good movie.  Sorry, it doesn't.  Viewers stop caring what is going on or to whom. Mr. Columbus, have trust in the characters and the story.  Skip piling on the gizmos- they are really not interesting!  The kids are cute, the adult actors are fantastic.  The sets are enchanting.  It is a movie that is a must-see for Christmas.  It is a good movie that could have been great. You'll be able to overlook that fact because you'll have fun.

","I am a major fan of the books.  Yes, I know what the cinemaphiles<br/><br/>out there are thinking:  keep the film and the book separate.  I<br/><br/>myself have made this complaint often with those who spend time<br/><br/>criticizing films based on the fact that directors and writers will<br/><br/>often take liberties with the plot and spirit of the book they are<br/><br/>adapting.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, as a fan of the books, I was pleased to see that<br/><br/>Chris Columbus didn't take  the low road with this film as he most<br/><br/>certainly is want to do.  He has created a remarkably faithful, solid<br/><br/>adaptation of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  He has also<br/><br/>taken virtually no risks in doing so.  <br/><br/>The Sorcerer's Stone is Rowling's first and, IMHO, the least of her<br/><br/>four novels to this date.  This isn't because the book is bad; no<br/><br/>indeed, the book is quite delightful.  It simply lacks the coherence<br/><br/>of the coherence of the next three.  This is largely due to the fact<br/><br/>that she is creating a singularly unique and rich environment that<br/><br/>she is just introducing in the first book, with little emphasis placed<br/><br/>on plot and storyline instead concentrating largely on introducing<br/><br/>the environment and the characters that are intrinsic to that<br/><br/>environment.<br/><br/>Columbus' film suffers the same fate, only to a larger scale<br/><br/>because of the inherent limitations of cinema.  It would have been<br/><br/>impossible for the film to have anything but a fractured feel to it<br/><br/>when the book itself suffers a similar fate.  Nevertheless, he gets<br/><br/>the important points right, from the swept-along-by-fate<br/><br/>forthrightness of Harry himself to the charming know-it-all<br/><br/>pluckiness of Hermione.  The setting too is delightful, a magically<br/><br/>twisted barrage of corridors, castles, and dungeons.  <br/><br/>I have high hopes for the next film; however, I do hope that some<br/><br/>day Mr. Columbus learns how to hold a shot long enough to<br/><br/>prevent the scattershot feel of The Sorcerer's Stone.  Alas, perhaps<br/><br/>this is too much to hope for from the director of Home Alone."

","There is one measure that very few movies even qualify for - visceral thrill.  There were several instances during the movie when I felt an emotional feeling that you rarely get with movies, especially as a male. Amongst those rare movies, the sad ones are prevalent and most capable of extracting emotional attachment by the viewer.<br/><br/>The rarer species are those movies that generate positive exuberance.  In my case, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is one of them.<br/><br/>Having read all 4 books to my son, I was quite familiar with the subject matter.  Despite fore-knowledge of the plot, I was enraptured by the story. I felt like a kid again, totally entranced by a wonderful story of magic wrapped around the classic battle of good vs. evil.  Despite all the hype, I did not emerge a jaded cynic.  It met all my expectations and perhaps a little bit more.<br/><br/>I felt the casting was excellent.  Snape (Alan Rickman) stands out in my mind as a perfect match for his role.  I also felt that the adaptation to film was well done.  Some things are better left in the book.  Some things actually work better in film, such as the Quidditch match.<br/><br/>Some reviewers may say that this movie does not stand on its own.  Perhaps not, but is that necessarily a bad thing?

The kids thought it ok, a similar reaction to Phantom Menace.  Films for kids (or maybe all) should be funny or exciting or both.  We found it neither.

","I had the privelage of seeing this film, and it was just as thrilling as I hoped it would be. (Please do not see this movie without at least a vague idea of the plot.) Book fans will find this film stays pretty true to the source, and only minimal details were kept out of the movie for time allotment reasons. If you are a parent and you want to take a small child, please understand that the length of this movie (about 2hours and 45 minutes) is not very suitable for some younger viewers. The action and climax of the plot was very satisfying, but there are some periods of plot development when the little ones will probably get squirmish. Older Potter fans will have nothing to worry about, as each scene in this movie is worth absorbing with great fervor. Be sure to watch the paintings on the walls in the background, I found many background special effects rather entertaining. Apart from the awesome plot and satisfying (but a bit hurried) quidditch game, the two best parts of the movie were (don't worry, I won't spoil the plot): 1. Oliver Wood, the Gryffindor Captain, played by Sean Biggerstaff. This guy definitely stole the show in his few scenes. He was gorgeous and had an accent, and I only wish they could have put him in more parts of the film. =) 2. Ron's (Ruert Grint) various facial expressions really conveyed his innocence, and he was just fun to watch.

"len-21","9","0","0","18 December 2001"," 9 on a scale of 10
","I went into this movie somewhat concerned about whether the subject matter would be offensive to me or anyone else who took religion seriously. I am quite aware that in western culture we tend to overlook many issues that conflict with historical (and conservative) religious viewpoints. Halloween would be a great example.<br/><br/>However, as I watched this movie I realized that considering the absence of any direct references to God or to the Devil, everything else was pretty much fair game. Furthermore, I had to ask myself why would this movie be offensive and yet evil, non human entities such as the Klingons or the Borg aren't. And, I couldn't come up with an answer. So, I look at it as a modern day fantasy (which it is) set in London that isn't all that much different than a futuristic science fiction movie about the struggle between good and evil.<br/><br/>Once I was over that issue, I could examine the movie on its merits. I had no idea how long it was until someone told me the time after the movie. I thought it was probably 2 hours, but I was surprised to hear it was over 2 1/2 hours. That clearly is a positive because it meant I wasn't bored.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely well crafted and the special effects are first rate. I was reminded of so many other movies as I watched it from Superman to the Wizard of Oz. But, it was about as unique a movie as you could ever hope to see. Having not read the book (a ridiculous waste of time when I can get it all for just a 2 1/2 hour investment), I had no idea how fantastic was/is the imagination of JK Rowling. How anyone could create an entire world such as this is remarkable - to say the least. Really, the Einstein of imagination.<br/><br/>One other thing. I noticed that the best two women groups in IMDB were under 18 years old and over 45 years old. And, the best men group is over 45 years old. That also is remarkable. It says that a story about a young boy in a fantasy world is liked as much or more by geezers such as myself. And, when you add the fact that ALL kids want to see it, you have the makings of a mega hit - perhaps the biggest of all time."

","I guess I got just TOO excited about the movie being called a faithful adaptation of the book.  The movie was entertaining but I could not help comparing it negatively to the book.<br/><br/>I thought all the actors were good but they seemed to be almost ""cardboard cutouts"" of the multifacited characters Ms. Rowling created.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was in the loss of Dumbledore's ""other side.""  Part of the enjoyment of the book is discovering with Harry that this ""completely insane"" odd bird is rightly someone Valdemort is frightened of.  The character in the movie is a bright and capable headmaster, but that was something that was at odd with his eccentricity.  None of the ""charm"" of the character is allowed into the movie.<br/><br/>Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, Dudley, Snape and Draco are all so tame in this movie that the viewer could not possibly understand how loath the book-character-Harry-Potter is to be around them.<br/><br/>And speaking of Harry, he is not the beaten-down, defeated character of the book that has to come to terms with being completely unknown and unwanted (especially by his family) to being THE CELEBRITY is a marvelous, magical world.  The BOOK-Harry would never have been brave enough to release the snake on Dudley as was done in the movie.  He just felt sympathy for another ""caged creature.""  That ""wicked grin"" was too confident for a boy who had been through what Harry had.<br/><br/>Why wasn't Dumbledore allowed to ""save"" Harry in the movie?  It was so much more impressive than the movie version?<br/><br/>Why wasn't Hermione allowed to do HER task in the movie?  In the book she solved a logic puzzle that was just as important as Ron's chess play (although not as self-sacrificing.)  And it was evident that only ONE could continue, rather than this very weak ""Stay with Ron and contact Dumbledore"" (both of which were completely unnecessary in the movie.)<br/><br/>Also the whole progression of the Harry/Ron/Hermione relationship was glossed over and seemed rather superficial.  The genuine affection that the boys and Hermione developed for each other beginning with the ""troll incident"" seemed to be lost in the movie.  They just seemed to start hanging out and tolerating each other (for want of anything ""better to do?"")<br/><br/>Why was the wonderful humor of the Weasley twins completely eliminated (except for one line at the railway station?)  They added so much to the book--showing Harry what a real FAMILY was like, not always perfect but supportive of one another, unpredictable and downright fun sometimes! A couple of quips on the Quiddich field would have taken no time at all and would have added a great deal.<br/><br/>I can see how things had to be cut (Hagrid's dragon adventure, scenes at Privet Dr.) but I feel that other cuts would have been more acceptable than taking out 1/2 of the ""grand finale"" and making the characters so superficial.  I am wondering how they are going to handle some of the incidents in the later movies (Dumbledore's suspension, Snape's continuing persecution of Harry, Harry reluctance to return home,the Weasley Twin's joke shop and map... that were so well set up by the end of the first book."

The movie serves as a good introduction to the world of Harry Potter. At first, before they get to Hogwarts, everything seemed to simply be underlining that Harry is a wizard without knowing it, but once in Hogwarts, the movie really starts to get interesting. Severus Snape and Quirrel seemed like fascinating characters. I particularly like the scene down in the dungeons, but telling more about that would be spoiling the movie. There were many scenes in this movie that reminded me of other movies. The scene where the owls surround the house reminded me of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"". The scene where the bookshelf drawers fly out reminded me of ""Ghostbusters"". The scene with the shifting staircases reminded me of M.C.Escher's paintings.

From the moment Hagrid appears it really kicks off and gets better and better with very memorable moments as such as the quidditch game and the chess match at the end, rivaling Goonies' best moments.

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fairly adequate piece of film making with some thrilling special effects;  however, it lacks the storytelling ability of the novel.  In fact, this film is proof that the depth of a novel disappears when one attempts to copy the story word-for-word, scene-for-scene. Most films adapted from novels utilize techniques geared toward ""motion picture story-telling"" which is quite different. I did thoroughly enjoy the special witchcraft effects.  I especially liked the fast and furious Quiddich game with its heart-stopping scenes that could make the Kentucky Derby look more like a tiny tots merry-go-round. <br/><br/>The acting of the young, newcomer leads is adequate.  The adults are wonderful in their roles.  Maggie Smith deserves extra kudos for her exceptionally enchanting portrayal of Professor McGonagall. Bottom line: the film should amuse Harry's legion of readers, though be prepared to ask the question, ""Why did I enjoy the book so much more?"" Non-readers may have trouble at times with the storyline, but will probably feel satisfied that they know a little more about the wonder of Harry Potter."

","I had grave reservations when I heard that Chris Columbus was directing the movie adaption of Rowling's excellent book, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone.""  His recent movie works have been syrupy and schmaltzy, and besides, how can an American properly direct the movie adaptions of such a ""vedy"" British series?  <br/><br/>However, I think Columbus has pulled it off, and has retained the spirit of the books quite nicely.  I still prefer the books and probably always will, as Rowling is such an incredible writer and conveys much more emotion and depth in the series than Columbus has thus far into his movie adaptions. <br/><br/>
Kudos to the children who play Harry, Hermione, and Ron - all are winning in their roles.  Daniel Radcliffe is simply perfect as Harry, and Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are admirably winsome. The casting of Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore was an excellent idea, and Maggie Smith does a noble service to her role as Headmistress McGonagall.  Robbie Coltrane is simply delightful as the lumbering but lovable Hagrid, and often steals the movie with his line deliveries - especially the often repeated ""Oh dear, I shouldna told ya that.""  <br/><br/>I was a little disappointed by Alan Rickman's Prof. Snape, who's been toned down a bit in the movie (he's much, much nastier in the book).  Rickman can play horribly mean very well (remember his role in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves?), so hopefully he'll be able to let loose in future movies.  I'm now definitely looking forward to the future Harry Potter movies - especially the adaption of the 4th book, The Goblet of Fire, which is quite dark."

The scenic environment, the castle, the location everything is so beautiful. The movie makes you believe you are living in it, like the book does.<br/><br/>One negative commend is that the movie goes little bit fast but then there is so much to cover so I can forgive that.<br/><br/>So I give it a 10, just trying to make out of all the unfair ratings.

"RawkStah","Null","0","0","15 November 2001"," Best. Game. Ever. Quidditch, that is.
","Quidditch is the Best.  Game.  Ever.<br/><br/>So, I saw Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone.  Sorry.  I couldn't think of a better intro than that.  I'm trying to avoid things that have been said and will be said.  Things like: `If you haven't heard of Harry Potter...' and `Pottermania is sweeping the nation...'  I saw Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone.  Regardless of anything anyone writes or says about the movie, it will be a huge hit.  Fortunately, it's a good flick.<br/><br/>Now, the movie assumes that the audience will know pretty much everything about Harry and his friends.  So, much of the film feels like Harry Potter and The Abridgement of The Sorcerer's Stone.  More on that later.<br/><br/>For those of you unfamiliar with the Potter mythos, here's the setup.  Harry (Radcliffe) is a wizard.  But, he doesn't know it.  His parents were killed when he was a baby, and he was left on the doorstep of his closest relatives, the Dursley's.  Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) are muggles.  (That's wizardese for non-magic users.)  And they hate anything that is out of the ordinary, including Harry.  Harry sleeps in the closet under the stairs, and is tormented by his cousin, Dudley (Harry Melling).  This has gone on for 11 years.  One day, a letter arrives for Harry from the Hogwarts Academy for Wizards.  This is not welcome in the Dursley house, you can bet that.  Uncle Vernon wants nothing to do with these stinking letters, and, after much ado, he moves the family out to a house on an island where no one can deliver the mail.  That, however, doesn't stop Rubeus Hagrid (Coltrane) from finding Harry, and taking him to Hogwarts, after stopping in Diagon Alley to pick up his school supplies. Everyone, it seems, knows Harry, and the legend surrounding him.  He was the only survivor of the attack that killed his parents.  Harry, just 1 year old, seems to have beaten the greatest threat that the world of magic has ever faced  the dread Lord Voldemort, or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.  Harry has lots to learn about wizards, witches, and the world he now lives in. Fortunately, he has help from his friends Ron Weasley (Grint), Hermione Granger (Watson), Hagrid, and Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Harris). Unfortunately, he also has to put up with Professor Serverus Snape (Rickman), Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and his gang, and staying out of the trouble that young wizards and witches tend to get into.<br/><br/>For those of you familiar with the Potter stories, here's a good place to resume reading.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was very good.  However, as I said, parts of it felt like an abridgement.  `Well, duh,' you're probably thinking.  `They couldn't put EVERYTHING in.'  And, I agree.  But, the things that were cut out were the things that I really liked about the book.  Harry's relationship with the Dursley's, for instance.  There is some very, very funny stuff to be found there.  It also seemed like they made Harry `nicer' in the movie.  He's not a jerk by any stretch of the imagination.  But, he gets into less trouble in the movie... OK, I have to stop this right now.  I'm not trying to compare the book and the movie, I'm here to tell you about the movie...<br/><br/>I think I can continue now.<br/><br/>What was good about Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone?  Many, many things.  The casting was dead-on.  Especially with the non-Harry characters. Emma Watson is perfect as Hermione Granger.  Rupert Grint was also a great choice for Ron Weasley.  Draco Malfoy and his gang are also played very well by those actors.  And the actors (yes, actors) who played Harry Potter did fine jobs.  Two people played Harry, because Radcliffe's voice changed during the filming.  So, in some scenes (I think I spotted one), Harry's voice is done by Joe Sowerbutts.  I understand that Sowerbutts also plays the voice of Harry in various other media.<br/><br/>The special effects were also quite good.  Mostly.  The mixing of real and computer-generated backgrounds and animations is good for the most part, but not universally.  Some of the CGI characters were outstanding  Hagrid's dragon Norbert and Fluffy, the 3-headed dog, come to mind as great examples. The Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin is lots of fun to watch, but not quite up to par with the previous cool' CGI sequence  the pod race in The Phantom Menace.  Of course, since Industrial Light and Magic did the special effects for Harry Potter, it's understandable, since ILM is working on another movie you may have heard of.  Star Wars Episode II  Attack of the Clones.  But, hey, the special effects do their job, and I'm not gonna complain.  Sometimes it's apparent that the people are acting in front of a green screen, but, for the target audience, they'll be mind-blowing.  Probably the best effect in the movie is Hagrid.  I don't know if they used CGI trickery, or prosthetic limbs, but Robbie Coltrane sure does look at least 8 feet tall.  That's certainly bigger than should be allowed.  (The previous sentence used to prove that I am not a muggle.)<br/><br/>Go and see this movie.  If for no other reason than you'll be able to understand what kids these days are talking about.  If you already know, you won't be disappointed in the adaptation.  If you don't know, well, you're in for a treat.  It's not like you will be able to avoid the franchise. Hopefully, they'll only get better, like the books have."

","I walked into 'Harry Potter' with as open a mind I could possibly have. I was (and still am) quite cynical about the entire hype surrounding the world of 'Harry Potter' though to be fair, I have yet to read the books. However, thanks to this movie, I am now intent on exploring for myself the wonderful world of 'Harry Potter'. <br/><br/>From an objective point of view, this film is pure fun and adventure. We are introduced to Harry as an abused young boy growing up with cruel foster parents and it is quite fun to see how he grows and develops into, well... need I say? Along the way, we are treated to various characters of the book, all of whom are portrayed with great enthusiasm by an awesome cast. I loved the gorgeous sets and the visual effects, while not brilliant, are well suited to the film. Kudos to Chris Columbus for having been able to orchestrate everything so well together.<br/><br/>Whilst watching it, I was pulled right into the realm of Harry Potter and emerged as a sort of convert. I still remain a cynic about all the hype but I was impressed enough by the film to try the books. My only complaint with the film would be that it is a bit too long and the momentum is disrupted somewhat but it is a minor niggle that fails to tarnish a good film."

Harry Potter is funny, very well acted, has great cinematography and some wicked special effects which make parts of the book look even better on screen as show for instance the wonderful Quidditch-scene and the scene in which Harry, Hermoine and Ron have to win in chess to get to the next room.

","I think this was a good adaptation from the original novel and an entertaining movie for Christmas. It must've been a fantastic movie for Potter's fans, since Rowling was very much involved in maintaining originality in the film making. The special effects and casting were good and well polished. The setting and atmosphere were magical too. A highly recommended adventure for the young ones. In terms of target reader/audience, the movie producer and J.K. Rowling have got it right. It was indeed a story that appeals more to the young audience, but rather shallow for mature audiences. I suggest reading The Books of Magic series, courtesy of DC/Vertigo Comics, a brilliant and superior predecessor to Harry Potter, by Neil Gaiman, John Bolton and John Ney Rieber."

Well that's what this film was like, a huge triumph of style and presentation over content. Yes, the sets were great, the set pieces wonderful (the Quidditch match was everything I had hoped for), the costumes cheesily perfect, but the direction was lousy and the acting was hammy with excruciating accents (adults) or wooden (children) with the exception of Emma Watson as Hermione who is my current pick for Star In The Making. The soundtrack was deafening sometimes too. And am I the only person who feels a little uncomfortable hearing an 11-year-old say ""Bloody hell""? (Was that in the book?)

","When I went to see this movie, no one was in the theater. I was literally the only one there. After feeling depressed upon realizing I had no friends or life, I started becoming consumed with the film. Was I the only one confused by that so-called Quidditch match? I mean, what kind of ridiculous game is that anyway. If I had been playing that game, I would have simply cast some sort of death spell on the other team, and then laughed a lot, while Alan Rickman and I talked about Die Hard (a far superior film in every way.) <br/><br/>People keep comparing this movie to Lord of the Rings. I don't understand why. They're not even in the same genre. This was some sort of pseudo tragedy with Arthurian overtones. Wasn't it obvious that Weasley was a Young King Arthur struggling with the knowledge and power of Excalibur? Secondly, Lord of the Rings is an epic comedy like Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run. Who doesn't laugh when Arwen does her pagan dance of Voodoo love?<br/><br/>
Another thing, people keep saying that scenes from Harry Potter are similar to those of the Phantom Menace. The Phantom Menace was horrible. Who cares if they borrowed scenes? If anything, they should have taken the scenes and not put them back, so as the Phantom Menace might be a better film. Would anyone really care if the stupid pod race wasn't in the movie? I surely wouldn't. For a satire on the contemporary human ethos of the Oedipus/Electra complex, Phantom Menace hardly lived up to expectations.<br/><br/>
Back to Harry Potter - I heard that in other countries, the original title is Philosopher's Stone; this is because stupid Americans become frightened by words like Philosopher. I agree. Americans are stupid. The school system in the states is pathetic, and it's teaching crazy people to compare this movie to other movies that cannot even begin to relate.<br/><br/>
The visuals weren't that impressive. Did anyone else notice that Harry Potter was being carried around by giant ropes? It was pretty obvious to me. And when that troll was in the school, was I the only one who noticed it was not a real troll? I'd think with the budget they must have had for this film, they could have hired a real troll. Also, the three headed dog was actually a two headed dog with a computer generated third head. It was clear that the so-called ""third head"" was poorly drawn by inferior computer designers. The best part of this movie would likely be the lesson I was taught at the end, which was that if a Wizard really likes you, you'll likely be able to cheat and steal points away from the evil looking blonde kid. It's a lesson we all have to learn in life, I'm happy to have learned it now.<br/><br/>Overall, I rate this movie a 10 out of 10, because it was bombastically beautiful."

","First things first, I have a tendency to look for common themes and complaints it seems. Having looked at some of the reviews here, there are two common ones split between those who love this flick and those who loathe it. Those who love it seem ready to bash other flicks, especially The Phantom Menace, as being not as good, while those who are bashing it bemoan how it rips off too many scenes from the Star Wars films. In addition it seems that the followers of Tolkien (or geeks as many of us, myself included were referred to in high school) are beating up on Harry as the Lord of the Rings movie approaches. <br/><br/>Let's think about this first. All three series are different animals made by different filmmakers and appealing to different audiences. All three are awaited (and somewhat hindered) by legions of devoted fans who will not accept anything but the best. Thus the current complaints that Harry isn't the book, it isn't Lord of the Rings, etc seems more in line with the recent IMDB poll about which fanbase is more obsessive. (Thankfully all three lost to that overachiever of geekdom, Star Trek).<br/><br/>Harry Potter was a decent film made from a good book. I admit I have read all four books and enjoyed them. What I think is happening, especially with the Tolkien heads is that they are irritated with the fact that Harry has gotten all the attention and that, despite how good Fellowship of the Ring turns out, it will never equal Harry at the box office due to the fact that kids won't be turning out like they did with Potter.<br/><br/>Let's lighten up people. These are films, not matters of life and death. They are made to be enjoyed. Obviously these are not film school flicks made to be dissected like a David Lynch movie for hidden meanings. They are popcorn flicks through and through. And stop beating up on the other geeks."

Personally, if adults go for these books, then I can tuthfully say our society has been ""dumbed down"" to the point that most people should go back to first grade. I have never seen Harry Potter as the breath of fresh air that so many people claim it is. The movie follows the shortcomings of the book, being a good kids' story, but far too bland and childish for any mature adult to like. If you claim to love harry potter just so your kids will think you are cool, then you're not even as mature as they are. There have been dozens of children's fantasy franchises that would make better movies than this. Chris Columbus, how could you SELL OUT like that? If you want your kids to read something imaginative, then introduce them to Lord of the Rings, so at least maybe they can get a sense of good or evil from the story."

","Since he composed the music for Star Wars and Indiana Jones he's one of the Great Unavoidables; and he won't let us forget. The charm of Harry Potter is the whimsical combination of high-quality storyline/visuals with what is essentially a juvenile setting, in the ""Boarding School Meets Tolkien"" vein. Alas, the film becomes brash, pretentious, and in-your-face by the blaring fanfares and thundering bass strings which are hurled at the audience at all moments and from all corners. From quidditch match to corridor encounters with Snape, there's Williams's MOOZICK telling us that this is BIG and EXCITING. Baboom, vavavavrunch, kablang, tinkletinkle. I found it really annoying and, melodically, very shallow. This type of score is basically an acoustic form of special effects, a horror vacui, and it's all piled on way too thick.

"Karlos-3","7","0","0","12 December 2001"," A very good rendering of a comic that is actually a novel.
","I couldn't help the feeling of emptiness after watching Harry Potter. The movie is wonderfully rendered. Acting is great. The only problem is that, the movie was either on a tight budget or on time contraints.<br/><br/>Watching the movie, you can't help but get the feeling that the director is trying to put as many aspects of the original novel into the movie that he doesn't give any of them justice.<br/><br/>For instance, Harry's family, they are protrayed sarcastically in the start and then completely forgotten, even Harry doesn't seem to recall they exist.<br/><br/>
Another example, is this Centaur that jumps in, saves Harry, and leaves. To people who read the novel, they might know who that is and feel empowered by such knowledge.. To the majority that didn't.. They are left feeling that a scene in which the centaur tells Harry who he is should be there.<br/><br/>And so the movie goes, after a slow calm start, the movie runs in similar fashion, at first portraying Harry's miserable childhood, and then quickly leaving that and taking you to Hogwarts where the movie portrays the wonders of the school and then leaves them there and shifts focus to the sorcerer's stone and Voldemort. And just when you get emersed into that, the final conflict is quickly upon you and it is one of the weakest final conflicts you have ever seen in a fantasy movie. There is no real battle.. No grand finale, no suspense. Nothing. Just a dead end. Perhaps the Novel had more to offer, but the movie did not, and so a better ending was in order.<br/><br/>And so, after leaving the movie, you feel pleased and disappointed. Every rendering of one aspect of Harry's story was accurate, the problem is that the sum of it didn't really fit together well nor did it do the story well. In fact, if there was one theme to the whole movie, it would be the four houses that the apprentices are inducted into. Which is sad because there are greater themes in the novel itself, but this is the only theme that flows through out the movie. Everything else pops in and then quickly pops out again.<br/><br/>I think the best solution to this problem would be to make the movie longer.. At least an extra hour of film is missing from this rendition of the Harry Potter stories. This is why I felt the movie was cut short for some reason. Any one can feel it. Every rendering that took place was accurate, but not one rendering gave justice to the original novel."
"Romas_ETHZ","7","0","0","11 December 2001"," Special effects instead of magic, and the flat performance
","Well, I would expect more from the most expected movie of the year. But if I start thinking what EXACTLY I would expect, I would hardly find an answer. The technical capabilities of the film-makers allow to create very astonishing and exciting special effects, but when it comes to magic, something even more special has to be done about it. I mean, I didn't really see a lot of magic on the screen - rather the special effects. The magic objects are acting on their own, not by the magic forces. A ""magic"" seen in a circus is more real than that seen in the ""Harry Potter"", most likely because the actors' play and the special effects are filmed separately and then mixed together. Consequently, the actors (mostly children) have to perform ""as if"", i.e. standing in the green room or somewhere and imagining a magic happening next to them and expressing emotions to the void. For me, this is the explanation why the characters are not that ""live"" and made up mostly of the cliches: a wicked guy always grins, a smart girl always manifests her outstanding knowledge, a clumsy boy would always fail to cast the spells. As I didn't read the book, I can't tell if the characters in the book are same flat and stereotypical, but I have an impression that it's the easiness of reading that contributed to the great popularity of the book. And I really doubt about the success of the movie because the flatness of the book would offer one to imagine what is not described, while the flatness of the movie leaves the ""imagination tanks"" in one's mind filled but partly."

I realize that not every little detail can be included into an already quite long movie, but some of the details which were omitted from the movie may have left some Harry Potter first-timers lost or detached from the main characters.<br/><br/>Audiences could not warm to Harry as his character was very one dimensional and there was a blink-and-you'll-miss explanation of why he was so special. This left audiences in the dark and they could not relate to the character and his plight. Harry was boring and there seemed to be nothing special about him at all. Ron Weasley however, was the highlight of the movie, with the casting being more accurate to the book than that of Harry. Overall, this was a good movie and kids will surely enjoy it.

","Being a major fan of the series, I thought the movie was extremely dissapointing. The following I liked:<br/><br/>1. Robbie Coltrane (oh, he stole the show as hagrid! he was exactly how I imagined him) 2. The scenery (gorgeous and most of it matched what I imagined) 3. Music (I love John Williams) 4. Rupert Grint. Out of the three child stars, he did the best job. 5. The Quidditch scene (well, even though the CGIS stuck out like a sore thumb, it was still interesting) 6. Alan Rickman 7. The Ollivander's scene (Well, I love how they did Diagon Alley)<br/><br/>But there rest of it was... well... flat. I can't honestly expect someone like Chris Columbus (Why him, of all directors?!) to take such a lovely book, and expect a good movie. It was trouble from the start. They didn't really capture what I love about the book, but instead gave a series of special effects that weren't really breathtaking or ground breaking. And it's sickening to think of all the merchendising that comes along with this franchise. It's not needed to sell the books. Heck, me and all my other HP friends don't even care for most of the junk they've put on the shelves. The books alone are enough to sell without a bad movie and merchandise. *hugs her books*they're special enough, and I cry over the fact that the movie is so degrading to the book. Please, don't judge by the movie. Read the books. Your imagination is much better then a movie screen.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I saw this film at the weekend and I was deeply disappointed by what I saw. I went to the cinema with an open mind, my girlfirend raving about how could the book is but I still didn't expect that much, and it did not deliver.<br/><br/>The film looks nice and the established actors do their job adequately (Robbie Coltrane, I have to confess, was excellent) but the younger actors just don't convince. I had heard a lot of good things about the ginger haired kid, yet his only lines that brought any laughter from the audience were when he degenerated into saying the phrase 'bloody hell' - that is a cheap laugh I would expect from a second-rate play at the local theatre.<br/><br/>
I'm sure reading the book makes the film more enjoyable, but a film should stand on its own two feet. However, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone may look good, but it is mainly poorly acted, the character's are undeveloped and it is simply boring viewing.<br/><br/>It will please the under twelve age group, anyone older is trying too hard to enjoy it. Where is the motivation behind looking for the stone? I'm sorry but 'they're just curious kids' will not wash with me after the film has had £90 million spent on it.<br/><br/>This isn't the worst film I've ever seen, 'Dude Where's my Car' is far worse to be fair, but it is very overrated and only made semi-interesting by a brilliant Robbie Coltrane. My mark? 3/10."
"holigor-3","7","0","0","9 December 2001"," An illustration to the book, read the book first.
","Unfortunately, the film cannot stand alone, without support of the book, and the viewers that did not read the book would find it long, boring, not accentuated. The suspense scenes are not suspenseful enough and the funny scenes are not funny enough. One of the subplots of the book is teaching Neville Longbottom to stand up for himself. The movie skips the moments of Malfoy's bullying Neville and thus the 10 points for Gryffindor in the end don't seem logical. It seems this is the result of poor editing. Some scenes were cut to make the movie shorter without taking into account the following scenes. Definitely, the movie is very politically correct avoiding calling Hermione a witch. That's funny but, unfortunately, this kills one of the funniest episodes in the book.<br/><br/>The special effects were good. The quidich game was simply great. Hogwarts was great too, especialy the Great Hall. But Hagrid's cabin had to be wooden.<br/><br/>The characters were not bad, especially bossy Hermione and Ron. Snape and Quirell were, weak, underdevelopped, however. I gave it 7/10. Perhaps a little bit too high. It is not a masterpiece but an enjoyable illustration to the book."

","In the opening scene of 'Philosopher's Stone,' Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) muses that the entire world will one day know the name of Harry Potter. The disturbing thing is, she isn't far from the truth. The 'Harry Potter' books, created by single British mum, J.K. Rowling, are now the most popular and best-selling books in history, their worldwide sales surpassing those of  J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy epic, 'The Lord of the Rings,' which for the last few decades has enjoyed the exalted position of being the highest-selling novel in history. So if you haven't heard the name of Harry Potter by now, you must have spent the last few years buried away in an underground cave on Pluto, with forks in your eyes and your ears stuffed with lead. These days, it's almost impossible to enter a shop without seeing his bespectacled face staring back at you from either a packet of jellybeans, a magazine, a pair of boxer shorts, a kitchen knife, or a tin of lawn mower fuel. Which is why it's no surprise that this is undoubtedly the most hyped film in cinematic history. But the big question on everyone's lips is: does the film live up to that hype? And the answer - yes and no.<br/><br/> Not being an avid Potterite, I went in to watch the film with quite an objective point of view. I barely knew anything of the story, the characters or really what to expect. Two hours and thirty-five minutes later, I'd realised one thing - this is a movie clearly made for the fans, the younger ones at that. Don't get me wrong, it's not that 'Philosopher's Stone' is a bad film, it's just that it's not a particularly good one. Visually, it's stunning. Columbus has truly brought the fantastic imagery of the world of Hogwart's to the big screen, and it really does look spectacular. Costumes, set design and special effects are all amazing, and are certainly some of the film's greatest assets. On the whole, the cast is great, particularly Robbie Coltrane's gentle giant Hagrid, Alan Rickman's deliciously dark Professor of Potions, Snape, and Harry's best friends, ginger-haired Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and know-all Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). As the boy from the cupboard under the stairs, 11-year-old Daniel Radcliffe does an adequate job, but lacks the believability and realism displayed by his child co-stars, required of a film's title character. This, however, may not be entirely his fault - Harry, at times, is given such awkward and cliché-riddled dialogue, that even if delivered by a classically trained thespian, it would still sound strained and uncomfortable. At 155 minutes, the film is overlong, and slow-plotting dilutes the story's action, with a few periods boring one of the friends I sat with to the point of having to repeatedly hit himself on the head with a glass bottle, in order to both stay awake and remain entertained. On the other hand, some scenes manage to be quite exciting - such as Harry's first Quidditch match, and the central trio's encounter with a huge troll - no matter how predictable they may be. The ending, however, is totally anti-climactic, and is an enormous let own  - a perfunctory wrap-up that's coated with more sugar than a fat man's Weet-Bix. This left me with the feeling that all of the magic on screen was nothing but simple smoke and mirrors, with some stylish design and special effects not able to make up for a flawed and obvious narrative.<br/><br/>After viewing the film, I re-read 'Philosopher's Stone,' and realised one thing: the film lacked what made the book so special - it's tongue-in-cheek sense of humour. Everything else was there, and the plot follows the book religiously, but that sneaking suspicion that the whole thing was really just having a bit of a go at us simply wasn't conveyed in the film. It does seem to lack the two-leveled humour that supposed `kid's movies' like 'Shrek' and the 'Toy Story' films have shown us recently, and may leave Potter-illiterate parents looking at their watches every three seconds, excusing themselves for their fifth toilet break since the opening titles.<br/><br/>While 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is certainly not the greatest film ever made - not even close to the best film of this year - it's obviously going to make more than enough money to pay for the series of Potter films that will inevitably follow, while obliterating every box-office record in history along the way. If you're a fan, you'll love it, and be queuing up to buy tickets to the next session after you leave the cinema. But, for those few among us not familiar enough with the world of Harry and his Hogwart's colleagues to be able to correctly define the term 'animagus,' the film does seem a little hollow. It's an enjoyable enough film to watch, even if only for the sake of seeing what all of the hype is about, but it basically comes down to one thing - the fact that while the books were written by a magic person, the film was obviously made by muggles. Just look out if the Harry Potter franchise ever joins forces with McDonald's - they'd create a power terrifying enough to rival even Lord Voldemort himself."

"Jane FlamE","Null","0","0","9 December 2001"," So it begins
","Let me start off by saying that it is a very hard thing to translate a book into a film format. It can be a huge success or a great failure. It is also made alot more difficult when the book in question has an absolutely phenomenal fanbase. Harry Potter has this, hence any director who was gonna tackle this task, had his or her work seriously cut out for them.<br/><br/>Speaking as someone who has read all 4 books and been captivated by them, I was hesitant to see this movie, but upon viewing it had it's great moments and failures. First of all the actors who played the 3 main characters achieve the great feat of bringing Harry Potter, Ron Wealsey and Hermione Granger to life in realistic fashion. Emma Watson as Hermione is the annoying know it all, Rupert Grintt is great as the boy who wants more yet doesn't have enough as Ron and Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter does steal the show, with the right amount of surprise at his wizard status and yet the lonely child orphaned at an early age.<br/><br/>The setting, in several locations over Britain, adds to the magic and sheer monstrosity that is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I was taken aback by the Quidditch Match. For the one thing, I was happy that I hadn't clearly imagined it while reading, because the filmed scenes filled in the necessary mental blocks.<br/><br/>I did note that there were several chunks of the story missing along with certain characters, but the film's current running time is 2hrs plus and taking into consideration that this is a CHILDREN'S film, the running us quite long. If the whole book had been filmed, I gurantee that this would definately be a 3hr plus film.<br/><br/>For the most part the film is a spectacular effort, especially from Chris Columbus. It has the appropriate darkness, as well as the fun and light hearted element. I found that those who complained were often speaking from the point of view of those who had read all of the novels and found that they possibly couldn't figure any edits that were justifiable. However the point is that as well as this being a kids movie and essentially a childs book, that is not how all the books are, they grow as children grow, which is why i will reserve my judgement for the film as a series until such time as they appear."

","Harry Potter. The name has become synonymous with the merchandising that surrounds it. While the attempt to make as much money as possible is a major factor in the toy production, it seems that the movie itself had other motives: to accurately and successfully adapt the treasured first book in the series. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is full of magic, mystery, and miscellaneous, as author J.K. Rowling derives style from books like Norman Juster's The Phantom Tollbooth and any of Roald Dahl's works. The movie keeps these delicate, creative qualities intact, while harnessing the advantages of film. The story follows 11 year old Harry Potter, from his wretched life with his aunt and uncle to his acceptance and enrollment at Hogwart's School of Wizardry. Harry must get acquainted to a new and magical world while he learns about his past and the mystery surrounding the heavily guarded Sorcerer's Stone. For those who read the book, the movie -- though 150 minutes long -- seems to rush. Though no plot is omitted, the extra detail that enhanced and decorated the book is missing. Fortunately, that is the biggest problem. When a three year old child and his parents can both sit still and enjoy a film for two and a half hours, something good is taking place. Director Chris Columbus (Home Alone) enhances his status in Hollywood with this film. He manages to make Harry Potter an interesting family film, full of suspense, intrigue, and humor, without resorting to childish jokes. All of the actors do a impressive job with their characters; even the child actors manage to evoke just the right emotion in the audience. Richard Harris and Maggie Smith make a fine team of professors. Harris plays Headmaster Dumbledore with the charm and intellect of the typical Merlin figure. Maggie Smith is perfect for the role of Professor McGonagall; she is strict and intimidating, but has good intentions and is always fair. The majority of the cast consists of experienced English actors who know how to use their character to power the conflicts and the plot development.<br/><br/>Unlike many other movies that grapple with high expectations, this one, like Harry himself, meets the challenge. Grade: A-"

","First of all, I've read the first two Potter books and found them pleasant and clever, but hardly brilliant. They certainly don't measure up to classics like the Narnia cycle, Tolkien's books, or Madeleine L'Engle's either (A Wrinkle in Time, for instance.) Though undoubtedly clever, much of the author's cleverness is of a literary nature, which made me skeptical about how it would fare as a film. My skepticism turns out to have been well-founded. The movie is certainly faithful to the book, perhaps too much so. It could have been pared by a half hour or so and been the better for it. Chris Columbus's overuse of close-up reaction shots--Harry grinning, Harry and his friends looking at something in pop-eyed awe, Harry grinning yet again--to drive home how a scene was supposed to make the viewer feel--drove me a little mad toward the end. Subtle, this director ain't. There is, to be sure, excellent work by some fine veteran actors, such as Richard Harris, John Hurt, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane. But, at the risk of being labeled a curmudgeon, I found the kids, though cute as buttons, were simply not up to their roles. Again, Columbus's constant closeups didn't serve the young actors well, and it may be regarded as unfair of me to expect kids to have the kind of inner resources to develop fully-fleshed performances. But they are expected to carry this film to a very large extent, and--well--they couldn't quite do so. There's also something a little repellent about the book and the film with respect to the portrayal of Muggles--non-initiates to the world of witchcraft--as being (at least implicitly) invariably stupid, crass, and cruel. I also question the propriety of equating obesity with meanness and greed---even worse in the book than the movie. Kids with a weight problem must have some difficulty dealing with this aspect of the world of Harry Potter. Well, my money has already gone into the record-breaking box office gross that this juggernaut is piling up. And that, after all, is the point. Maybe the next film in the series will be better; the young actors will be a year older and the second book is a little more substantial than the first. But I do wish they'd bring in a different director. Under the circumstances, there's not a hope of that. Bah, humbug."
"Bologna King","9","0","0","10 December 2001"," READ THE BOOK!!!
","Skim through the comments, talk to friends, and you'll find out: this is a movie designed for those who have already read the book.  The director C. Columbus has focused on giving us visual interpretations of the scenes, persons and monsters J.K. Rowling described in her story at the expense of her humour, subtle plot twists, and character development, particularly of Harry.  The plot line of Harry's solving the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone (that's the REAL name of the thing--ask any alchemist) is emphasized to the detriment of the more subtle plot of Harry's struggle to achieve self-confidence and a feeling of belonging after his abusive upbringing with the Dursleys.<br/><br/>For those who have already read the book, all of these gaps are filled in from their reading.  The result is that almost all enjoyed the film (although the book was better) except those few whose mental images were impaired or who couldn't understand that some things had to be left out if the film was to be a watchable length.<br/><br/>Of those who watched the film without reading the book first, the missing plot points and character development either makes them wish they had read the book first, and to vow to remedy that defect without delay, or to sneer at these faults because they cannot be solved within the context of the film without radically deviating from the books themselves.  While it may in some cases be fair to say that a film should stand on its own, this one was never meant to do so.  It is an illustration to a novel.  It should be viewed on this level or not at all.<br/><br/>The upshot is, if you plan to see this movie, READ THE BOOK FIRST!!!  You are much more likely to enjoy the film.  Also, do not be confused by the hype or spin-off merchandising.  The success of the Harry Potter novels is based exclusively on their merit as books and that success was well-established long before there was any hype or franchising.  Only those both ignorant and cynical would attribute the notoriety of the stories to hype or franchising.  Ask any kid who has read them."

Her reaction was: ""It was a very pretty cartoon strip"".<br/><br/>And finally the Quidditch (?sp?) Match was perhaps a bit too long and had too much influence of G.

All those wonderful reviews, and glowing, practically gushing user comments.....I found myself forking over just shy of $10 and was eager for the consciousness-expanding event everyone was promising.  About an hour into Harry Potter, the only thing expanding was boredom and a certain irritation.  I must say, at this point, that I love fantasy....ever since I was a kid.  I've read and cherished Tolkien and Piers Anthony.  I haven't read Rowling, but I'm sure I would have enjoyed it just as much.  Therefore, I was quite excited during the previews in spite of the nagging problem with Columbus being the director.  What I received was more than 2 hours of blockbuster mediocrity all dressed up with noise and serviceable special effects.  The quality of style seemed to deteriorate as the movie progressed.  The final battle for the Stone at the end was stylistically awful.  The goofy head of the villain fused to the back of the instructor was on par with some of the creatures seen in mid-80's horror flicks.  I remember laughing out loud.  And did anyone notice the wretched editing??!!  This amazed me.....I mean how many bazillion dollars went into the film, and you have Dennis the Menace doing the editing.

","I really liked Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but I felt it lacked some of the essentials from the book. Like when Harry gets fitted with his robes, he meets a blonde haired boy (Draco Malfoy). This is important because the relationship between the two is vital to the Harry Potter series - it's when they first meet and its significant. Harry doesn't know what Draco's like at that time, it's only later that he really sees Draco for what he is. From that point on, Draco and his friends make it very hard for Harry and his friends. I was disappointed that they didn't show the duel between Draco and Harry. I also thought that at some points the movie went a little fast. It also seemed that some connections in the book were not properly done in the movie. For example, they should have shown the Dursleys before Harry was brought to live with them - it obvious that they don't want anything to do with magic and the first part of Chapter 1 shows this. Overall, the movie was well done but hopefully Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets will go a touch more indepth and better show important connections."

","Well I went to theater this evening too see Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone, too see what all that fuss was about.<br/><br/>And I came out after two and a half hours later. <br/><br/>Nothing new, predictable twists, too much characters. This movie looks like a raw cut to me. You're here, then you go there and all of the sudden you're back here etcetera etcetera... It's really confusing. I did not read the book and I'm going too.

","After many years spent directing mediocre/awful films, Chris Columbus has finally found his fated place in cinema.  ""Harry Potter..."" (thankfully) bears little resemblance to Home Alone but is far more reminiscent of the wonderful mid-80s years when Columbus was writing the likes of ""The Goonies"", ""Gremlins"" and ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" while Spielberg produced them.  Like these older films, ""Harry Potter..."" isn't condescending to the younger audience both in its material (scary moments and violence) and its length.<br/><br/>Columbus and Kloves clearly made the (correct) assumption that most children who see the film will have read the book.  With that in mind, they manage to cover a huge amount in the 2 1/2 hours that could well leave new-comers in the dark.  Even at this length, however, there is still a good deal missing from the film, most noticeably Peeves the Poltergeist who was cut out at the last minute.  Personally, I feel that the film could have spent a further 10 or 15 minutes showing more of the everyday life of Hogwarts covering more lesson time thus allowing for more animosity to develop between Malfoy and Harry, and between Ron and Hermione before the troll incident.  With any luck, the DVD might provide us with some of the missing material.<br/><br/>Overall, the film has shown the potential for an incredible series which, at least for the younger viewers of today, could certainly rival the Star Wars series.  Indeed 2002 is set to stage an epic battle of sequels - Star Wars II Vs Harry Potter 2 (as well as Lord of the Rings 2).  Judging by the Phantom Menace, ""Chamber of Secrets"" is looking far more promising than ""Attack of the Clones""..."

","To be put simply Harry Potter is: Very Entertaining. It was at times slightly mundane, but I put that down to the fact that I had read the book only a day before, so I knew every scene that was coming.<br/><br/>    Apart from that, the special effects were breathtaking, just amazing. The movie setting was spot on, people must understand that in order for Harry Potter to of done well in movie form, the SFX and sets were as equally as important as the actors and storyline. This may not of be the case for other movies, but it is crucial for Harry Potter, as the wizarding world MUST be brought to life through visuals too. As for the acting - well, you don't have to be the next Meryl Streep to play the parts of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Although having said that, Ron played by Rupert Grint was absolutely brilliant. He got the right expressions in just the right amounts without over-doing it (like his co-star Emma Watson who played Hermione). Daniel Radcliffe as Harry...I would say it was a good choice. In the books, unlike the other characters, Harry's personality is the most hard to depict, even though he's the central focus. He does not have as strong traits of personality as the other characters. Therefore, although people might describe Daniel Radcliffe as ""wooden"", he's only playing up to his character. Overall, pleasurable viewing. Any who say otherwise, either do not like this genre or have been swept up by the hype and have too high expectations. The soundtrack is also very good."

That was my favorite thing, imagining what it might look like and then seeing it! It was like having your dreams become a reality because when you read it everything is so clearly written that you see what Rowlings saw. Chris did wonderfully to see what everyone saw. As for the acting I LOVED Rupert Grint as Ron! If you just watch him he makes the cutest faces. Radcliffe was also brilliant to just watch. Although I love Alan Rickman I thought he could have played Snape a little better. I saw Snape as rather a powerful little weasel but he did ok. Maggie Smith is just wonderful at everything she does! I was disappointed with the shortness of Neville's role however. If you read the book the ending point giving seems more earned for Longbottom. They effects were VERY well done and I wasn't unimpressed with the Quidditch scene although my imagination looked a little bit different.

The best thing is that they had actors speak with an English accent, creates nice impression.<br/><br/>The worse side is that the film is done for children with an excessive childish attitude.<br/><br/>It had an impression that the film is cut in pieces. Apparently they tried to fit the book in 2 hours.<br/><br/>It's not clear was it intended or not, but some parts look too pathetic, while the others are not well punched. Some dialogs are pompous and while those that should be are not.

","Wild About Harry<br/><br/>By C.J. Cauley<br/><br/>If there is one movie that can be called a sure blockbuster even before its release, it's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  One of the most anticipated movies in recent years, it perhaps even eclipses the mania that preceded Star Wars, The Phantom Menace.  Advance tickets are selling faster than any other film released in the U.S. this year.  The London debut of the film on November 4 drew an estimated 10,000 fans, slightly less filled the seats at the AMC theater at Newport on the Levee.  Before the curtain went up, hundreds lined up for the special sneak preview on November 11. Little ones were wearing black robes and wizard hats and waving their magic wands to try to make the line move faster.  They grew more and more impatient with every passing minute.  Finally, the moment of truth had arrived.<br/><br/>
Based on J.K. Rowling's wildy popular children's book of the same name, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone takes us on a magical journey with an unlikely hero, the young Master Harry Potter.  Orphaned as a baby, Harry is raised by the Dursleys, his wicked aunt and uncle who force him to sleep in a cupboard while his cousin, Dudley, leads a charmed life.  Harry's life soon makes an abrupt change as Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry comes knocking on his eleventh birthday.  He learns that he is the son of a witch and wizard who died to save him from the evil Lord Voldemort, a Hogwart's wizard gone bad.  All of this was kept from him by his not-so-well-meaning guardians.  The Dursleys are what are commonly referred to as Muggles, or non-magic people.  Harry was about to exit their world and enter into a whole new existence.  Every child dreams that they are adopted and will someday find out that they are a royal prince or princess from some far away land.  Harry lives that dream as a wizard rather than a prince.<br/><br/>Harry, being the only person to ever survive Lord Voldemort's wrath, is quite the celebrity at Hogwart's.  He was too young to remember but he retains a reminder of the attack on his forehead in the form of a lightening-shaped scar (although it looks more like a slanted Z).  The once lonely boy makes new friends, especially Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and learns more about his role in the recent history of magic.  The three friends, all first-years at the school, learn more about their surroundings and each other while stumbling onto a mystery involving the Sorcerer's Stone.  Along the way, we're dealt clues as well as red herrings and we meet an admirable cast of characters.  Alan Rickman is the dark Professor Snape that Harry and his friends believe is up to no good.  Richard Harris is exquisite as the old and wise Headmaster Albus Dumbledore.  Robbie Coltrane will make you chuckle as the enormous and lovable Gamekeeper, Rubeus Hagrid. Maggie Smith shines as Professor Minerva McGonagall and John Cleese gets honorable mention as Nearly Headless Nick, one of the many ghosts who haunt Hogwart's.<br/><br/>It's often said there are three things you should NEVER work with in any movie:  kids, animals and special effects.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has all three.  The kids are adorable and the animals, magical but the special effects could have used a little work.  There were a few scenes where the digital imagery looked more cartoonish than real and the transitions were not seamless.  Any lack of realism in the special effects, though, were more than made up for in set design.  Filmed in the U.K. at locations in Gloucester, Durham and Oxford, director Chris Columbus was able to find magnificent buildings to play as backdrops.  Alnwick Castle is just one such place.  Foreboding and medieval, Alnwick Castle plays Hogwart's for many of the outdoor scenes.  Indoor scenes were shot at Gloucester Cathedral, Oxford and Durham Cathedral.  All are brilliant in beauty and majesty.  Columbus was just as selective with his child stars.  Daniel Radcliffe is a dead ringer for the Harry Potter that J.K. Rowlings envisioned and Rupert Grint is a standout in the cast as Ron.  They, along with Emma Watson who played Hermione, will soon find themselves the Macaulay Culkins of their generation.<br/><br/>As is often the case with movies that are derived from books, there were omissions but Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone managed to stay true to the book for the most part.  There is some mild language but it's the scary moments that may caution parents of younger children.  The only bothersome thing were a few visual clues in the movie that the book lacked.  This slight dumbing-down of the plot is something J.K. Rowlings never does to her readers.  This was probably done to make it a little easier for younger viewers to understand but it made it a little too easy for parents.  In addition, we should have seen more of the Weasley twins, their humor could have stolen the show if given the chance.  Sadly, two and a half hours is just not long enough to bring the entire book to life but rest assured, before all is said and done, you too will be wild about Harry.  1,000 points for Gryffindor!"
"alimoose37","10","0","0","5 December 2001"," Great, but not as good as the books.
","To say the least I love these books. Some might say I'm obsessed , but I'm not, I've only read all of them at least 4 times. But this is all beside the point. When I went to see Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I had prepared myself for disappointment, because every movie that is based on a book is never as good as the books. But I was surprised . The movie was very accurate, they just cut out some of my favorite parts. Like Norbert the Dragon, he has a whole chapter designated to him in the book but in the movie he has like 4 min. But then again they couldn't have this be a 4 hour movie. But the main thing that I was upset about them cutting out, was one of my favorite lines. But don't get me wrong the movie was so accurate you could practically read along, well not quite but you get my point. This is probably because J.K. Rowling overlooked the making of the movie. My father who was the only on in my family who has not read the books, loved the movie, and this has caused him to start reading ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"". Which I imagine is happening everywhere. Which is great because the books are wonderful and have morals, like even if everyone hates you there is someone out there that will love you. And plus reading is fundamental. Which would help our world in the bad shape it is in."

When the film finally came out people went expecting to see a bad movie made simply to make money from all the fans.

","I have not read the books, and I found the movie to be quite good. I had been prepared for a story aimed too much at a viewer half my age, but it was not an issue. (I'd have like a couple of things expanded upon or explained, but mostly ""leaving it to your imagination"" is a good enough excuse.)<br/><br/>One issue I have, looking at the movie as it stands ignoring that it is following a prewritten book, is that once again the female lead, who seems to be pretty much an equal to the male lead, is treated rather poorly. This is a problem with so many films it is surprising there isn't more people highlighting it. (It's similar to seeing more smoking in a movie than you see in real life -- it stands out as different to your experience and effectively detracts from the film. I'm not saying this as a politically correct thing, just that, unless there is a clear reason why the female should be lesser to the male in the world described by the film, the equality we are generally used to now should be [attempted to be] reflected in the film.)<br/><br/>In summary, definitely worth seeing as it is enjoyable, if a little light."

","The only regret I have about HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE is that I'm not ten years old anymore.  Alas, I'm double that age (still young, obviously!!), and only discovered the wonder of Harry Potter, Hogwarts and Quidditch eighteen months ago.  Of course, I've since purchased all four novels and two supplementaries (FANTASTIC CREATURES and QUIDDITCH), and have just seen the film, which opened five days ago here.  Yes, I suppose we had our own books and films when we were children (including FINDERS KEEPERS, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES, BATMAN, THE WITCHES), but nothing which united (nearly) everyone, and appealed to parents and older children as much as HARRY POTTER.  The simplicity of the concept is, of course, the key: it's a fairly formulaic plot, with semi-predictable twists (of course, I'm speaking more from an adult point of view here) and the subject matter is something which will continue to fascinate children for generations to come - magic. The film is, in my opinion, the best possible outcome of attempting to adapt the novel: the Quidditch game is spot-on, the child actors are well-cast (even if they do try to overact in places, but one has to expect this), the magic of Hogwarts Castle and Hogwarts Express and the invisibility cloak is definitely there.  Some have accused it of dragging in the middle - I must say I was expecting this, being a part-Hollywood production and nearly 150 minutes long, but I never experienced it: I was obviously too preoccupied with the wonder and magic of it all.  I couldn't help thinking how I would have reacted to such a film ten years ago: I would have surely been in heaven.  The real magic of the story is, of course, Rowling's promotion of ""dorky"" behaviour, which has been victimised in the last fifteen years from Americanised ""satirical"" TV series (THE SIMPSONS, SOUTH PARK, etc...) and general irresponsibility by marketers aiming their products at children. For example, children as young as seven and eight are worrying about ""image"" - boys must have short spikey blonde-tipped hair like the boy-bands, and girls must dress like Brittney: they are being forced to grow up far too quickly, and are exposed to images etc which have detracted from traditional children's stories...until now.  Ten-year-olds don't listen to Peter Coombe anymore, because there's no such performer out there: youngsters still have The Wiggles, and Hi-Five is doing its best, but acts like Brittney Spears & Co. have broken into this (very lucrative) age bracket - kids must now act like teenagers, another culture which didn't exist pre-rock'n'roll.  But with texts like HARRY POTTER, MONSTERS INC, A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, etc..., kids can be kids again: it's becoming accepted once more.  Hell, HARRY POTTER promotes reading, playing chess, intelligence, initiative - and glasses (!!), five things which have certainly been ""outlawed"" in the past decade by THE SIMPSONS and SOUTH PARK-style shows.  Rating: 9/10."

","After reading the book, the first question that comes in mind about a movie about it is: what for ? Why should anyone want to watch the movie after reading the book ?<br/><br/>This was my first and foremost question, before I even saw the actual movie. With it I walked watching the actual picture, and it certainly had an answer for it.<br/><br/>Where should I start ? Where stop ?<br/><br/>The cast to Harry Potter is simply unbelievable good, the primus inter pares of strengths of this movie. Harry, Hermione, Ron and Hagrid simply got the right actors, which fit to their roles as perfectly natural as Angelina Jolie to Lara Croft (""Tomb Raider""), or Hugh Jackman to Wolvenrine (""X-Men""). And that in four roles at the same time ! Snape got Alan Rickman (""Galaxy Quest"", ""Dogma"" etc), which looks only like a very bad choice until you've seen him, words are simply not enough to describe his simply genial acting here ! Definitely the best actor of the movie, which had no lack of good actors. The rest of the cast was extremely well chosen, and well acted, too. If at all, Dudley wasn't fat enough, and his role was far more aggressive than in the book, and well I always thought of Draco as being far more charismatic.<br/><br/>The other parts of the movie was just as good. Acting was very good to brilliant, directing etc was good, effects where wonderful: for example, Quidditch matches looked as real as they possibly could, even if I would have liked to see some more uses of slow motion here. A specialist told me that the sorting hat wasn't completely perfect, but I didn't noticed that (except that it was definitely smaller than in the book).<br/><br/>After seeing the movie for the first time, I was a little bit surprised that Daniel Radcliffe get bad comments from some people. I've checked this again when seeing the movie the second time, and I definitely and wholeheartedly disagree. Harry looks a little stunned at the start of the movie, but thats what one would expect - he tries not to get the attention of the Dursleys, plus they don't care about his feelings, and then Hagrid comes and tells him he is a wizard ! Harry's acting is just right at these places, I cannot imagine it done better.<br/><br/>The same goes for anyone commenting bad on either Ron or Hermione. These three are all simply natural ! Just look at real children, they don't have a broader set of expressions either. It is just like it should be.<br/><br/>Other people comment that the movie is just too faithful to the book, and that that is 'boring'. I strongly disagree, I don't want to see a movie about the book where some 'genius' has changed the plot. That would be completely annoying, upset me, and makes no sense. And, for example, do you ever remember a bad comment about a Shakespeare movie because they stick to the original plot ?<br/><br/>The real problem of the movie was time famine. Many funny parts of the book where left out, and many scenes, especially at the start, where simply too short to include the humor of the original book. To really understand and enjoy the movie, one REALLY should have read the book before !<br/><br/>And that was also the answer to my question at the start: this movie is finally incomplete, it cannot replace the reading, but it can give you the pictures you had on the inside while reading it again, and faithfully.<br/><br/>GREAT !!! I've seen it three times now, and I plan to see it again !"

","The studios must have agonised over how to translate JK Rowling's 'instant classic' to the big screen.  Perhaps this was its problem.  From the first, each story is so tightly-plotted and intricately woven that it is nigh on impossible to have every important detail crammed into two and a half hours. Yet, this is exactly what Chris Columbus and his stellar cast attempted to do.<br/><br/>As Lord of the Rings prepares to enter the box office race, it is difficult not to draw comparisons, but LotR has an instant advantage in that many of its cast members used to be celebrated child actors: In Elijah Wood, we see a promising pint-sized thespian full-grown into an outright star, and Sean 'Goonies' Astin may have struggled to maintain his profile since the 1980s, but still has the Hollywood seal of someone who has grown up in the limelight.  The main problem with the pre-teen Potter stars is quite simply that they are children, and it is hard to expect eleven year-olds to carry a multi-million-dollar project.<br/><br/>Still, there are delightful performances from the young cast, especially the dazzling Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy.  Rupert Grint is an exceptionally accurate Ron Weasley, and Daniel Radcliffe lives and breathes the role of Potter.  Yes, at their young age, there are many moments where their performances are stilted and stage-school-like.  On the other hand, they have a refreshingly innocent quality that is often missing from big-name child stars like the original Potter choice, Haley Joel Osment.  At the crucial moments, like the affecting encounter with the Mirror of Erised, Radcliffe expertly conveys the sense of loss and longing the role requires. As for the adults, Alan Rickman is a simply perfect Snape, and Ian Hart an unrecognisable Quirrel.<br/><br/>For an adult watching the movie, it is all too easy to criticise the film's attempts to capture all the events at the expense of the chapters where the characters are developed - it didn't escape many notices that most of Potter's scenes of actually performing magic are edited out.  Still, we can only hope that the following films will redress this balance, and bring out the full essence of these coming-of-age dramas.  This first Harry Potter movie will delight fans of the books, but is unlikely to recruit new readers.  However, anyone under the age of twelve will be absolutely spellbound."

","Harry Potter has been hyped as potentially the biggest movie ever. Like many but not all ""biggest movie ever"" blockbusters, the movie doesn't live up to a fraction of the hype. The story is centered around an orphan who has magical powers and lives with his aunt and uncle. The movie is visually stunning but leaves the viewer emotionally disconnected. This is a characteristic common of all ""biggest movie ever made"" type films, all multimillion dollar special effects and no real story or compelling characters.  There is no definite antagonist that interacts with Harry. The viewer is given very little information about Harry's origins. It seems like a bunch of short stories glued together. In addition there is no emotion or no heart tugging in this film. Its certainly no E.T.! I felt that the title role was miscasted, Daniel Radcliffe didn't display too much enthusiasm and seemed too robotic at times. Its like vice versa of Haley Joel Osmont in A.I. where he's a robot named David but Haley plays the role so well we feel for his character. Its difficult to make any connection with Harry and care what happens to the character. The movie just meanders around. Its not unentertaining its just that with all the technical feats, the movie's artistry is sorely missing. I would give the film a C+, its entertaining for a while but totally forgettable. If you're under the age of 12 its a B+."

","My wife read the book over a year ago and told me I would like it. I said, ""Yeah it seems interesting, but it's for little kids"". I therefore saw it in the theatre without reading the book first. I loved every minute of the film, from start to finish. I haven't enjoyed a movie in the theatre that much since Braveheart in '95. Knowing that books are always better than the movie versions, I realized my wife was right and that by falsely ""assuming"" it was only for kids, I cheated myself out of sheer enjoyment for quite some time. I purchased the book a week after watching the movie and upon finishing it, I was thoroughly amazed at how well the screenwriters adapted the story to film. Some people say that too much was left out. I say ""Hogwash"". This was a wonderful story, and the adaptation was as good as it could have been. Most people haven't ever seen a script and therefore don't realize that even a long script is extremely 'abbreviated' compared to a literary narrative. The filmmakers get an A+ on this one or rather, a 10 rating. Also, Thanx J. K. Rowling, for inventing a wonderful world in which people of ALL ages can readily escape."
"ISNIndigo","Null","0","0","2 December 2001"," Faithful Adaptation, but apparently too subtly directed for some.
","I've seen Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone four times already, so I think I have seen it from a variety of mindsets and viewpoints. First and foremost, the titling was changed as a result of the book's title being changed in the US because Scholastic thought ""Philosopher's Stone"" would go over the heads of kids or bore them.<br/><br/>That said,  I must respectfully disagree with those who said that Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry was underperformed.   Harry Potter is a boy who has lived in a hostile environment of emotional abuse and physical neglect.  This is in no way conducive to the generation of an outgoing, over-the-top personality.  Plus, the English are a little more circumspect in their attitudes.   Columbus was correct in portraying Harry as sort of meek and mild-mannered, and only riled when his friends were provoked or endangered.<br/><br/>Insofar as there was only so much Columbus could squeeze into two and a half hours,  this was, bar none, the most faithful adaptation of a novel I have seen in many years.   The few liberties taken for cinematic convention were understandable and forgiveable.  The major problem I had with the film was the score by John Williams -- who is succumbing to Horner/Elfman syndrome; which is to say that his scores are starting to sound all like one another. I kept thinking of ""Hook"".<br/><br/>The portrayals of the adults were exceptional.  Rickman was exquisitely foreboding as Snape. Smith as McGonnagal was prim and severe.  Harris took a bit to warm to the role of Dumbledore but once he got it, had the same warm, benevolent sense I got from reading the character in the book.  Robbie Coltraine as Hagrid was nothing short of a perfect portrayal.<br/><br/>Harry and his compatriots were also well-done.  I've already spoken about Radcliffe.  Felton has this lovely faux-innocence and malice that he plays together.  Watson's got the whole overachiever thing down to perfection, and Grint has the quiet pride of Ron Weasley subtle at first, but like Harris, warms to the role and makes it his.<br/><br/>It was difficult to cram an entire year of Harry's life into a 2.5 hour movie, and it will only become more difficult to squeeze a year of Hogwarts into the next three films as Rowling's books only get bigger and more involved.<br/><br/>Summing up,  any movie that can keep kids from age 3 to age 14 quiet for two and a half hours has something going for it.  And if *they* didn't believe it was true to the book,  we would've heard about it before now.<br/><br/>This film had a lot of expectations and a lot of hype.  To me, it met both. Columbus has a lot to be proud of, as does his entire cast.  I look forward with equal eagerness to the next film in the series next year.<br/><br/>GO GO GRYFFINDOR!  ;D"

","Making a full-size book into a film is a huge challenge. When that book is as well-known and action-packed as Harry Potter et al, the challenge looks well-nigh impossible, and so my expectations for this film started out low. Then the reviews started to come in, along with claims that the film was miraculously not bad at all. My expectations shot up again. Foolish...<br/><br/>In brief, the film is nothing more or less than a very pretty condensed summary of the book. All the scenes are there, portrayed in loving detail, but all the character development and atmosphere of the book have been stripped away in the attempt to fit all the scenes in. Several of the actors, e.g. Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint do an excellent job, but most do not manage to develop any personality, including Daniel Radcliffe (Harry). The computer graphics are excellent IMHO although opinions vary.<br/><br/>In retrospect it would probably not have been possible to do much better with this without seriously altering the story. If you're a fan, you'll go and see it anyway, but don't, like me, get your hopes up..."

Can you even comprehend the difficulty of what they set out to do in making this film? Bad acting? Radcliffe does an outstanding job of playing Harry Potter exactly as he is in the books. Very laid back, unassuming, quiet.<br/><br/> The comments about John William's score just crack me up. Where the heck have you been the last 30 years. The guy is brilliant - the music was perfect for this movie, one of the highlights. The music in SWPM was one of the things that held the movie above water.<br/><br/> It is common for people to gain attention by disliking something that is popular. Heck, we have a whole generation of people who don't know what they like because they are too concerned with what they don't like.<br/><br/> I've read the books in the series twice. Yes, some things were left out. It's a movie - that's what always happens. Did you want an 8 hour movie? Heck, The Stand was over 6 hours and only contained about 25% of what was in the book.<br/><br/> My expectations when going into the theater were:  It's not going to be exactly like the book; It's a kids movie, so expect a kids movie; Hope the child actors can pull off their roles and give me a visual representation of the wizard world and the characters that is similar to what I have in my mind<br/><br/> This movie surpassed my expectations. The acting was good (great at times), the music was great, and the movie appeals to everyone. It held my interest for the entire 2.5 hours and seemed to be over before it started.<br/><br/> It's nearing the $200 million mark. Argue all you want about it being a bad movie - it's pointless.

The adults actors are fine, the children are on the whole cast well and the effects are OK but nothing special. I had read the book beforehand but the friend I saw this with had not, yet we both felt the same at the end - something was missing that's hard to pin point - something to stop us really liking the film as much as we would have hoped.

This may be partially due to the bad director (Columbus) whose style is devoid of feeling or flare.

","Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone has remained faithful to the book and there are millions who just love J.K Rowling's books about the little boy who is a wizard.<br/><br/>	But we should remain mindful of the little boy who said that `I like books more than movies because the pictures are better.' We are also sensible to be a little trepidatious when we approach film adaptations of our favourite books, particularly if the book is as full as the Harry Potter books are of wonderful, vibrant mind images.<br/><br/>	So there are some minor disappointments in the film. Hermione is far too earnest, all of the time, and isn't as little girl scruffy as I imagined her. And where was her cat? The great hall I imagined to be larger and in fact the castle that is Hogwarth's school just seemed too small altogether.<br/><br/>	Our sighting of Voldemort supping on the Unicorn wasn't as horrifying as I hoped it would be and the centaur looked a little fake but these are mild criticisms and are also in keeping with the rather bland treatment of the more frightening moments from the book.<br/><br/>	And I'm sure that that's exactly what the producers and J.K. Rowling were aiming for because Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone is above all a very nice, intriguing and imaginative children's movie not especially designed for older viewers. Here is a film aimed at lovers of the book who are also children.<br/><br/>	Still there was enough to enliven a good deal of  interest for older viewers.<br/><br/>	The Quidditch game enlivened my mental images from the book as did that wonderful Troll, dumb enough to be both dangerous and funny.  Young Ron was a delight as was Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. Alan Rickman owns the rights to characters you shouldn't trust and Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter mixed just the correct amount of fear, boyish enthusiasm and intelligence into his work.<br/><br/>	All of those owls delivering that hail storm of letters was remarkable and the moving stairs were fun, but we'd been let down by seeing them in the shorts.<br/><br/>	The film is long, too long for me, but I doubt that a younger lover of the books would agree. But then it could have been much longer if all of the details from the book had been covered. It's just that the books are so richly dense with ideas.<br/><br/>	The ghosts had almost no play for example and the guardian portraits were only introduced. I did enjoy the way images moved, were alive, on things like cards and portraits though. That was created more vividly in the film than in the book. Where was that confrontation with dark forces on the train.<br/><br/>	But there are at least four more of the these films to be released and no doubt many of these tantalising aspects will be dealt with.<br/><br/>	Younger film goers will want to see Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone more than once. Older viewers might find it a tad tiresome but still pretty good fun.<br/><br/>	4 Hogwarts Flys Out Of Five"

","Unless you're still too young to earn your own income chances are this movie will not sweep you off your feet and give you the experience the hype has been promising. That is not to say you won't enjoy the film, far from it! With some brilliant acting and a very original plot you can certainly expect to be entertained. However with the lack of some genuine fear and feeling for the characters on screen the promise of `the best movie ever' is a little off the mark.<br/><br/>Creating the atmosphere that sucks an audience into a story is arguably what Hollywood struggles with most and this film is no exception. Despite the strong performance of Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and friends Rupert Grint (Ronald 'Ron' Weasley ) and Emma Watson(Hermione Granger), the fact the film is aimed at children creates a distinct lack of emotional involvement we are used to in some of the better pieces of recent cinema. Harry's encounter with the snake at the beginning of the movie sums up the emotional level the film is aimed at.<br/><br/>The support cast is perhaps more relevant to older audiences and definitely provides the best moments in the film. Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman steel the show in with some authentic acting that makes the world of Harry seem much more real than the special effects make you feel. Coltrane provides most of the comedy relief and does so with the same line on a number of occasions. <br/><br/>The Special effects, whilst grand and definitely not cheap tend to overshadow a story that is beyond the need for extravagant computer generated effects. Besides the game of Quidditch, the Troll, and Fluffy, there were only minor requirements for the computer. Unfortunately there were a number of visually obvious computer additions that likened the awful Jar Jar Binks of Star Wars.<br/><br/>The films strength however lies in the story line. Whilst some scenes may seem oddly familiar to those well versed in Fantasy and Science Fiction, for the rest of us `main-stream' folk the world of Harry Potter is a fresh sight. Without a clear beginning, middle, or end, the story instead builds from the basic premise that Harry is something special. With no strong and outward villain for most of the film the pace and motivation of the story surprisingly held together quite well and is nothing but a huge testament to the abilities of the books author J.K. Rowling.<br/><br/>A novel to film adaptation is and always will be an immense task, particularly when the novel has a following most authors can only dream about. What would make it even harder is the promise to keep true to the written word, which is exactly what director Christopher Columbus swore to do. The finished product, whilst a breath of fresh cinema, ultimately fails to deliver much more then another Children's holiday adventure."

","I've waited a while to see Harry Potter.  I've read the books, loved the world, and admittedly, I've been a little hesitant as I've watched this great series overmarketed to the point where it's almost the next Pokemon.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the movie retains the dignity of the book.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of mixed reaction to this film.  Some absolutely love it. Others think it slow-paced and incredibly dull.  I think the enjoyment of this film will be based on if you read the books or not.  I do think some of the terminology and ""understoods"" of the character motivations in the movie would be somewhat incomprehensible for someone not initiated with Potter's world.  Hopefully, this would prompt the uninitiated to read the books before they blast this movie or see the next one.  The source material is very accurate with only minor deviations.<br/><br/>That aside, as someone who HAS read the book, I thought the film was quite simply delightful; a term that I normally don't use in describing a film. It adequately captures the moments that made the book so much fun to read. It captures all the details of the books, from Halloween to Christmas, the the ""Return of the Jedi""-esque (in speed and pacing at least) Quidditch match, and even the moments of Harry's wonder of his new world as well as his feelings of dealing with the truth of the loss of his parents.  What moments I feared would be lost in the translation were kept in there.  As for the cast themselves, the children playing Harry, Ron and Hermione were very likable and accurate to their book counterparts.  The same goes for the adults as well.<br/><br/>True, like any book-based movie, there are changes.  The good news is that even if they moved a conversation or act, they normally made reference to it in some way rather than forgetting it.  The biggest omission I noticed was the removal of Peeves.  Hopefully, he'll make a return in the second film.<br/><br/>Another thing people have criticized about this film is John Williams' score.  Yes, it does not have the impact of say Star Wars, E.T., Indiana Jones or Schindler's List, but it does add to the film and not ""overwhelm"" it ""sell the movie"" like a lot of people feel it does.  There's no one forcing hands or wallets to go buy the soundtrack.  Perhaps people wanted a soundtrack with Jessica Simpson or yet another film with Smashmouth's ""All-Star"" placed in it. <br/><br/>As a fan, I had a good time with this film, and was glad to see that they kept the feel of the book as well as they did.  For a ""children's"" (I used the term loosely based off the number of adults who enjoy it as well) film, clocking in around 2 1/2 hours is a pretty long time to ask kids to sit through, but I think older kids will be able to.  Plus, there are a few scenes that may be a bit too intense for the little ones, such as dealing with Voldemort and Fluffy.<br/><br/>I recommend this film.  It's easily one of the best I've seen for this year. I will, however, give this recommendation: If you don't know Harry Potter, I really suggest reading the book before or directly after seeing this film so you can make comparisons to it.  You'll find the two don't change that much from the other, and knowing the source material beforehand, while not mandatory, will certainly help make the experience that much more enjoyable. And if you don't want to read the books, ask someone close by.  You'll run across more people who know of it than don't.<br/><br/>One can only wonder how long a film the phonebook-sized Book 4 will be...."

Leguin's ""Earthsea"" series, so I figure I'd enjoy this story, although it's somewhat derivative of ""A Wizard of Earthsea"").  Anyway, I kept wishing I was 10 years old when I saw this, because I would have enjoyed it more. Still, the film was undeniably magical, the CGI/Special effects weren't overdone (or were seamless enough to blend in), and the acting was excellent.<br/><br/>Agreed with other reviewers that the film never ""soars"" and never fully achieves what it could, but attribute this to squeezing so much plot into the film's running time.  If this movie is as faithful to the book as I understand, then it's a rarity -- ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" are two others that manage to be faithful to the book, yet in the former case somehow outdoes the book (may be the first and only time).<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm rambling.  This film was magical & entertaining, especially for kids.  I think it suffers only from the fact that expectations were set too high due to hype, and the unbelievable popularity of the books.  You just can't expect a film to live up to the potential of the book, especially if the book is tremendously good -- it's patently unfair to judge a film based on that criteria.  9/10."

","I saw this film with my 6 year old daughter and we both enjoyed it very much.  We didn't really realize the length of the film until we left the theater.  My daughter didn't get antsy at all!  I thought it was paced well and not too violent or frightening.  All the acting was okay, the veterans of course were excellent along with the child actor playing Ron Weasley. My main complaint was with the continuity of the film.  I suppose it is very difficult to film a movie with child actors as they must grow like weeds throughout the production.  This particular movie was obviously filmed in non-sequential order as Harry ages throughout but not so in a continuous manner.  He's young, He's old, oops he's young again!<br/><br/>Other than that issue, I thought the film was enjoyable and very imaginative.  I'm sure it was a disappointment to many adults and children who had read the book however considering Hollywood's past track record people should know what to expect!"

","Having just walked out of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", this reviewer is still reeling from the experience.  Who would have thought Chris Columbus had another masterpiece left in him after ""Adventures in Babysitting""?  Columbus proves that his breakthrough was no fluke, and that he can indeed helm such a highly anticipated fantasy film without fail. Despite terrific performance from the fat guy in ""Naked Gun 2"" and Peter O'Toole's drunken sidekick, however, ""Potter"" feels somewhat incomplete. What it needed was a cameo from Michael Gross of ""Family Ties"".  Gross was born to play the janitor of the Hogwarts institute, but the lack of originality on Columbus's part prevented this from happening.  Instead, he relies on the talents of John Lennon in the title role (the bespeckled one hasn't acted in over thirty years, so Columbus's choice here is rather puzzling).  Nonetheless, a great effort by all involved."

","Harry Potter met many standards that were hard to step up to, considering the imaginative depictions that J. K. Rowling created. The film was able to meet many of those standards, becoming one of the only films to successfully portray an outstanding book. Not only was the story almost true to its form but it also was visually stunning. Plus, the cast could not have been better. To be honest, I was fearful of butchery caused by the bad acting skills that children generally provide. Thank goodness for the excellent casting director who placed Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Tom Felton in this movie. Though they are all young they have talent beyond that of their peers. If not for the visually stunning beauty and acting alone, Harry Potter is a must-see film."
"knuman","Null","0","0","29 November 2001"," Have to admit I was a little disappointed
","Saw the film last night. I had a lot of expectations going in, but while I still enjoyed the movie, it didn't nearly live up to my expectations. I didn't have a problem with the length, and even though it closely followed most of the book, the book was able to flow, but the movie felt somewhat disjointed. The Quidditch scenes were easily the highlight of the film, and the general sets and special effects were extremely good too.<br/><br/>There were a few pretty big problems with the movie though. Firstly, Radcliffe can't act. Grint and especially Watson easily outshone him. It might be partly the director or screenwriter's fault, because to me it didn't feel like Harry was the main character- he was just one of a few main characters. He simply didn't have the charisma or ability to carry the film. But he's still young and hopefully he'll improve by the next movie. The adult actors were all brilliant, in particular Coltrane and Rickman.<br/><br/>Columbus had a tough job with this movie, since he had to cater for not just children but also a lot of adults. He had a good dose of humour in there, but some of the (cornier) lines didn't work on screen, whereas they did in the book. It's really a shame, because the movie could have been so much better. I thought Tim Burton would have been able to capture that gothic feel a lot better. With that being said, I'll still be looking forward to the next one."

","Many film critics seem to be hitting some of the same points in their reviews:  The film is too faithful to the book; the film is too long; the director didn't take enough risks; there's 'something missing' here. Generally, I do agree that the film had one too many set pieces, but I disagree that the film was too faithful to its source.  I think nearly all the scenes in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" were necessary to tell the whole story, something most Hollywood movies have a hard time doing these days.  Isn't it refreshing to see a film where each scene actually flows logically into the next?<br/><br/>The one scene I had a tough time warming up to was the ""Troll"" sequence.  I thought it was an unbelievable contrivance in the book, and it was even worse in the film.  Of course, at scene's end, the audience needs to see a glimpse of Professor Snape's bloodied leg so as to heighten suspense, but this moment could have been combined with a different scene to make the story more efficient.  Other than that, I thought many of the book's subplots were appropriately condensed or excised.<br/><br/>
In some ways, the film improves upon the novel.  Steven Kloves' script wisely sidesteps the inane commentary of Lee Jordan during the Quidditch match.  And I felt that the result of the showdown between Potter and Voldemort was more satisfying in the film than in the novel.  Of course, with all the trimming and cutting, it's unfortunate that certain great quips and exchanges between characters are given the axe, but I must say that the filmmakers have created a compelling drama which, for the most part, captures the essence of Rowlings' popular book.<br/><br/>Overall, Chris Columbus' direction is solid, if not particularly brilliant.  Columbus has often exhibited solid crafstmanship over the years, and here, his skill lies in bringing the story to the audience in a straight-forward, but engaging way.<br/><br/>The acting is quite strong.  Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry as the cool, calm center of the film.  Rupert Grint displays expert comic timing as the underpriveleged, but spirited Ron Weasley.  nd Emma Watson captures perfectly the precociousness of Hermione Granger.  Of the adults, all are stellar, with Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltraine standouts as the sinister Professor Severus Snape and giant groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid, respectively.<br/><br/>Regarding the score, John Williams occasionally overwhelms the action with obvious emotional payoffs.  But his score also creates gentle lyrical moments, as when Potter sits and stares out the window at the moonlit lake during his very first night at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>One wonders how the Academy will warm up to the picture.  It certainly has an epic quality and seems to possess all the elements of a classic film. I predict that it will receive nominations for Costume, Makeup, Visual Effects, Sound, and Editing, but not Best Picture.  However, with such paltry offerings at the multi-plexes this year, who knows what could happen?"

","As an adult with no children and having not read any of the books I was wondering what all the fuss was about. Obviously I can't make comparison or express disappointments between book and film but I can see enough strange, menacing and funny characters as well as myriad incidents to keep most children enthralled for more than two hours. We can clearly see where the money has been well spent in transforming this parallel magical universe into something that George Lucas would put his name to. I was rather surprised by the relatively subdued reaction of the(mostly under 15) audience both during and at the end of the movie, with few fearful gasps or hoots of laughter that makes me wonder that my simliar behaviour was not so off the mark. I feel there is not very much in this film for most adults (or their inner children) especially when one compares it to brilliant efforts like the Toy Stories, Shrek and not to mention all the Simpsons episodes. I'm sure my commentary is quite irrelevant to all the kids still waiting to see it (or see it again) so call my reaction humbug and I await a visit from the Ghost of Hogwarts Past anytime now !"

It was wonderful and it appealed to ALL ages, whether or not there were huge amounts of toys to be spawned for the children's third of the fanbase.<br/><br/>Later, unfortunately, came the remake of ""Return of the Jedi"" and the abominable ""Phantom Menace"", ... which could have been shown as double features with STRICTLY FOR CHILDREN's movies ""Pokemon"" and any film with the Olsen Twins.<br/><br/>I'm 32 years old, I have no children, and I have never read a Harry Potter book.  So, I have no idea how loyal this movie is to the book series' mythology, setting, etc.  Nor do I hear about it 24/7 from any kids who live around me, so I can't be bloody SICK of hearing anything that mentions Muggles, Quidditch, ANY-flavoured jelly beans, etc.<br/><br/>I HAVE, however, seen this film and found it much more enjoyable as an adult (with or without kids) and as the kid I once was.<br/><br/>And both of those sides of me find it much more fun to watch and ENJOY than the ""Special"" version ""Return of the Jedi"" and the nightmare ""Episode 1"" of the Star Wars Trilogy.  If those two are any sign of things to come, I say George Lucas should hang it up, because ... <br/><br/>HERE COMES HARRY!!!  <br/><br/>By the way, does anybody wonder about any kind of lawsuits between  This Harry Potter and the Harry Potter character in the movie ""Troll"", which came WAY BEFORE the first book was even written?<br/><br/>EXCELLENT FOR ADULTS AND KIDS OF ALL AGES!!  <br/><br/>That's a wrap!"

It made it sound like this doesn't compare favorably with ""Hamburger: The Movie."" I am a over fifty years old and thought I would be pretty lukewarm to a ""kids"" movie. I have been listening for a year to kids raving about the Harry Potter books. Their eyes light up--they are enthused about a ""book."" When I went to see it, I had just read the book the night before because I like to see how they translate. The script was delightful. The characters were charming. The acting in this movie is wonderful--were you expecting Bergman? The pacing is delightful. The sets are eerie and forbidding. I thought that the wonderment of the characters was there in full force. Who did you have in mind to play Harry? Are there any actors that you approve of? Perhaps Kevin Spacy should have played Harry. How about the blond girl from American Beauty as Hermione. Johnny Depp as Ron Weasley. Oh yeah--as I recall, Stephen Spielberg has made a couple of pretty decent movies.<br/><br/>We are introduced to the Harry Potter canon as he becomes a foundling, taken into a family that mistreats him and has no respect for his general goodness. Of course, they pay a price for their insensitivity and Harry takes the magical journey to enroll at Hogwarts. It is obvious that his coming has great import for everyone. He meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and they begin a quest to locate the Sorcerer's Stone. We find out about Voldemort and the curse that hangs over Hogwarts, going back centuries. We are also introduced to Quiddich which will be a staple for all episodes. Harry also must struggle with what happened to his parents and, like Frodo in ""Lord of the Rings,"" his quest and what it means. Outstanding film."

","When Chris Columbus was announced as the director of the Harry Potter movie adaptations, my heart sank.  It was bad enough when Steven Spielberg--another horribly superficial director--was going to do them, but Chris Columbus?!<br/><br/>Somehow, Columbus and Steve Kloves, the writer, have managed to totally miss what made the Harry Potter books so appealing. Very little of their charm and none of their wit survived the transition to the big screen.<br/><br/>It must have taken a Herculean effort by Columbus and Kloves to drain this wonderfully imaginative book of every ounce of what made it magical.<br/><br/>There is no sense at all of what makes Harry so special.  Part of the fault for this major shortcoming rests with the kid playing Harry. He is not a novice performer but nevertheless can't act. Cast members such as Fiona Shaw, the great Irish stage actress, was given ONE speech as Harry's aunt.  And what about the gloriously expressive Julie Walters?  Reduced to little more than a walk on part.<br/><br/>Regardless of the size of their roles in the sequel, they were underused in this first movie.  And John Cleese was horrible.  I hope he's sitting back in Santa Barbara home and laughing at how much he got paid for phoning in this embarrassing performance.<br/><br/>Was  that really Alan Rickman mugging and overacting as Professor Snape or Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails?  I love Maggie Smith but she's too old for Professor McGonagall.<br/><br/>As the writer, Kloves must also shoulder some of the responsibility.  But Columbus is the real culprit here.  Like Spielberg, Penny Marshall and Ron Howard, Chris Columbus does not trust his audience.<br/><br/>He feels he must telegraph every emotion and manipulate us with innumerable reaction shots and, even worse, John Williams' horribly overblown music.   Can Williams please do us a favor and stop writing film scores and concentrate on the Boston Pops?  He doesn't know the meaning of the word ""subtle.""<br/><br/>The constant cutting away to reaction shots--of awe and wonder-- were beyond irritating.   And surely Hagrid has enough personality without Kloves having to give him his own special catchphrase (""I shouldn't have said that"")  to repeat and repeat and repeat ad infinitum?<br/><br/>As a fan of the books, for me this film was disastrous.  It is upsetting to think something that means a lot to so many people was summarily handed over to someone with the depth of a piece of tissue paper.<br/><br/>By trying to please everyone, Columbus, Kloves, the producers and Warner Bros. have really ended up pleasing no-one--except perhaps J.K. Rowling's bank manager.<br/><br/>Harry Potter fans would have been better served by a multi-part, high class TV adaptation than this mess."

","I took my two sons (7 & 8) to see the movie and they absolutely enjoyed it. I thought the movie was good, but was disappointed with how it quickly rushed through the introduction.  In order for those who haven't read the books to understand how important Harry Potter's character is, I thought the movie should have focused on some of the smaller points in the book, i.e. the celebration of the wizarding world after Lord Voldemort was believed to have been defeated and of course the memorable first time he boards the Hogwarts express and you sense the excitement of the Weasley family when they discover that they have just met Harry Potter, the excitement aboard the train when word gets out that Harry Potter is on the train and how astonished Harry is with all this attention.  But enough about what wasn't portrayed, overall I think that the movie was done satisfactory.  Not many can successfully translate a book motivated on pure emotions into a movie. It may be able to satisfy you visually, but not connect you with the characters the way your own imagination can.  The actors were wonderful and played their characters true to form, but again I wished that they had more time to better portray their characters, especially Snape.  I only hope that those who haven't read the books but have seen the movie will be motivated to read the books so they too can understand what all the hype is about. These books have given new life to reading instead of watching T.V. or playing electronic mindless games.  I'll definitely go to see the next Harry Potter movie, but I doubt that I'll rush out to see it as soon as it's released.  I will however stand in line to buy the next book!!!"

","There are so many book to movie adaptations that have failed to meet the grand expectations of their predecessors we could go on counting forever. Nearly.  Harry Potter is quite unique in how well it follows the father plot to the T.  Therein lies its greatest fault; Harry Potter the movie is a testament as to why most science-fiction and fantasy books will never see the silver screen: they have way too much stuff going on for a cohesive time slot, even at 2 1/2 hours.<br/><br/> Even with all of the effects, the casual viewer and the book-thumper sense that something is missing.  There is a whole lot going on, but there isn't much feeling behind it.  Whereas other films (Six-string Samurai and Buckaroo Bonzai) have managed to carry their obsurd worlds quite nicely, Harry's is hackneyed and stilted, leaning heavily on the reader to fill in the blanks like a ridiculously long mad lib.<br/><br/> This film is so difficult to rate as a result of the above.

Chris Columbus is to be congratulated for making a movie with real heart.  Although some concessions necessarily had to be made in the script, the spirit as well as the letter of the book is wonderfully captured.<br/><br/>Some highlights--first of all, the children are wonderfully cast.  Harry has that elusive blend of geekiness and charm, and Hermione, Ron, and even Neville and Malfoy are believable but not precious. Commenting as a grown-up fan, I can say that Alan Rickman brought a dimension to Professor Snape that was both surprising and intriguing--rather than playing a cookie-cutter villain, he brought ambiguity to the role with a physicality and sheer animal magnetism that left me a bit breathless (and scrambling to find his other movies).  And yes, Hagrid practically steals the show.<br/><br/>Kudos to John Williams for a score that enchants but doesn't overpower, and to the special effects wizards for making everything look truly magical. However, the most satisfying thing about this movie is that the writing is intelligent and the actors are allowed to develop their characters--something that is increasingly rare.

"nrussell-2","Null","0","0","26 November 2001"," Shouldn't have been made, but good adaption (except Dumbledore)
","My main criticism of the film was that it shouldn't have been made at all. Rowling's books are extremely imaginative and filled with small details and philosophy, none of which transfer well to the screen.  Fitting a long book such as The Sorcerer's Stone into the constraints of a movie is naturally going to require massive cutting of a story that relies on its buildup to create the magical world.  Personally, my favorite character was Dumbledore, who's mysticism, quiet brilliance, and idiosyncrasies of personality and philosophy come to life in the books.  In the movie, however, nearly all of his interesting lines are cut, and his character is almost fatally degraded. Hopefully, this will be replaced in the later films, but I think the Sorcerer's Stone would have retained more of Rowling's childlike quality if he hadn't been so heavily edited.  Even through this, however, the adaption worked relatively well, considering the nearly impossible task.  The characters, too, were well done, though I think Harry should have shown a little more surprise at his new surroundings (an important part of the realism of the books, which is overlooked in the movie, probably because of time constraints).  All thoughts of plot and characters aside, the commercialization of Harry Potter sickens me: nothing dulls the magic of such a book more than seeing it everywhere.  Bill Watterson, creator of Calvin and Hobbes, understood this perfectly, and therefore didn't allow his syndicate to license his creation.  Rowling should have done the same thing, and allowing the story to be made into a movie only makes it worse.  Harry Potter has become a catch-phrase for the over-commercial culture, and this commercialization is destroying it.  Still, even though it's principle is flawed, the movie was allright."

","I have previously posted a review for this film and I felt it wasn't long enough to show how much I enjoyed this film.At the time I typed that review,I had no idea what to put down.First of all,I would like to mention that ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a film for the entire family and is almost 2hrs,30min or a little less of pure family entertainment.This film is enchanting in every way,providing excitement and fantasy for an entire audience and a is very surprisingly fun film to watch due to it's casting.I have never read any of the ""Harry Potter"" books because I knew that they were so big I would never catch up.The same thing with ""Superman:The Movie"".Never read the comics,although I looked at the pictures.Well,I read some of the comics but not all of them.I usually do not compare films to the novels or comics that they were adapted from because it wouldn't make sense for me.So I look at a book as a book and a movie as a movie.Alright,so far ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" attracted alot of audience members and is the kind of film I will see again.I think this film has a great chance come Oscar time for the Art Direction award.""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is in every way just as fun to watch tecnically and emotionally."
"hkoolman","Null","0","0","26 November 2001"," Good attempt but a little weak.
","The film does the best it can in, compressing an 8-hour book into a two and a half hour film. Especially when you consider the book contains some 21or more rich characters; non-stop action, intrigue and interwoven incidents; beautifully described locations and scenes. Well.. you just can't you can't do it! But this film gives a good taste of what the book is about a general whip through the plot.<br/><br/> It is a great pity, I feel, that this book was not made into a TV series. Then we could have had a half hour episode for each chapter from the book, which in my view is the only way they could have done the story REAL justice. But I guess it would not have made so much money.<br/><br/> The film has some great special effects . the Quiditch match, the Troll, The chess game, the keys, Hagrid.<br/><br/> On the down side, the film lost a lot of the tension from the book as none of the actors showed any real strong emotion, and there were some small little touches which would have added so much but were sadly missing. For example; where was the twinkle in Dumbldore's eyes! I know Allen Rickman (my favourite actor playing Snape) can sneer and look much more sinister than he did. There was no teasing between Harry/Ron and Hermione. Why was Draco not flanked by his body guards Crab and Goyle?! Peeves is edited out completely.<br/><br/>The sorting hat is 10 sizes too small! Harry's time with the Dursleys was too short and unconvincing. However all that said.. Professor McGonagall and Madame Hooch were excellent. Argos Filch was horribly good but his cat should have been a Devon or Cornish Rex.<br/><br/> So much of the emotion of the book, which makes for tension and for deep characters, was missing, sadly.<br/><br/> I hope people who see the film will be encouraged to the read the book if they have not already done so."

","The movie was well made, and it was true to the book, there was<br/><br/>not a lot of ""Hollywood"" influences.  However, the movie did not<br/><br/>provide much insight into the characters such as Albus<br/><br/>Dumbledore and Hagrid.  However since the book was so long<br/><br/>and packed with details, it is difficult to make all of the information<br/><br/>into a reasonably short movie.  Therefore you are provided with<br/><br/>one long 2 hour rising climax, until the very end when you are<br/><br/>giving a conclusion to all of the ideas presented throughout the<br/><br/>movie.  In contrast, the book provides many scenes in which there<br/><br/>is a rising climax and then conclusions to those scenes. <br/><br/>Therefore if you haven't read the book, then you will wonder why<br/><br/>you are being presented so many different ideas throughout the<br/><br/>movie.

","I was so thrilled with the film version of _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_, that I went to see it four times.  I am an avid reader of J.K. Rowling's momentous book series and I was pleasantly surprised at how well the film adhered to her books. From a technical perspective, the sets were straight from heaven.  Diagon Alley, the aerial view of the Hogwarts Express speeding through the green countryside, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it all took my breath away.  The costumes also deserve a mention here as a plethora of colors and textures came to life in the Diagon Alley scene and, also, the school uniforms and dress of the faculty at Hogwarts were just as I had imagined them. The acting was flawless.  Kudos to the kids, especially: not an element of Macaulay Culkin among any of them.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson embodied Harry, Ron, and Hermione to perfection.  Robbie Coltrane, Dame Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Warwick Davis, Ian Hart, Zoe Wanamaker, Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths, and absolutely everyone else simply *were* their characters.  Oh, and Alan Rickman. . . I could tell he knew more than I did about Severus Snape's character; his performance was free from all blemishes and far surpassed my expectations.  The supporting roles filled by Verne Troyer, John Cleese, and John Hurt, among others were delightful additions to a leviathan work of cinema. I was tremendously impressed with the film's attention to detail and its strict adherence to the books.  I felt that such faithfulness made it a truly successful endeavor and I for one was greatly appreciative of such an homage."
"charlesb-3","Null","0","0","26 November 2001"," An inspired compromise!
","I have read some 200 of the reviews, and apart from the religious nutter who thinks that JK Rowling is a supporter of the Beelzebub-Moloch fan club (I sincerely hope that Ms Rowling puts a few barbs into her later books about this sort of character, perhaps a Professor Waco, visiting expert in Defence against Nonexistent Things in volume 6 would be appropriate), it seems to me that this movie has managed to achieve a remarkable compromise.<br/><br/>Leaving aside the slightly uneven quality of the CGI (and the centaur in particular), relevant criticism seems rare (Harry isn't Indiana Jones, he's something of an Everyman who has wound up somewhere where there are many wonderful things, and he's the only one who doesn't understand them; but then 11 year olds aren't like that are they?). There seems to be almost no criticism of the cast - in my opinion this is probably the best cast film I have seen since Casablanca (and I thought Paul Henreid/Victor Laszlo was pretty doubtful - who would get killed for a wimp like him?). Similarly, there has been, as far as I can see, none at all of the visualization of the train, Hogwart's school, Hagrid's hut or any of the other locations. In fact, King's Cross station platforms 9 and 10 are much less interesting than the film version. OK Harry's cubby-hole was less grim than I had imagined, and the Dursleys less wicked and malevolent, but I suspect more literal visual versions of the book would begin to raise questions about why Harry hadn't been carted off by social workers.<br/><br/>The filmmakers have managed to:<br/><br/>1) Satisfy the primary target audience of the books, viz. children from 8 to 14<br/><br/>2) Satisfy the adult readers of the series who find the books a witty and compelling read<br/><br/>3) Satisfy some of the adult non-readers, and after all, if you haven't been persuaded to read Harry Potter by the sheer magnitude of the interest, then you probably aren't very susceptible to this kind of thing<br/><br/>4) Capture enough of the essence of a fairly anarchic English boarding school to make it into a place which is in fact dominated by a society of children, even if the adults are nominally in charge.<br/><br/>The film had to be a massive compromise; it could not contain every detail. I should have liked more Snape, more Scabbers and more Hermione being clever, and being lonely, more Weasleys Â… but then I usually manage to sit through Seven Samurai in  one go, few 8 years olds have the bladder capacity to manage that.<br/><br/>JK Rowling's style is, in many ways, very 'flat'; she tells you just what you need to know- though you don't always realize it-  with sharp wit, so there was only a very limited scope for interpreting the story without distorting it. This is, perhaps, the exact opposite of Shakespeare where the richness of the language allows all kinds of distortion of the presentation without any harm at all being done to the play, indeed the most basic production can sometime bring out the genius of the language better than large amounts of 'reality' can.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus was on a hiding to nothing. A darker film would have had parents complaining that their 8 year old needed therapy after seeing Voldemort, a more slapstick film would have infuriated the adult readers, a more 'adult' version would have debased the underlying insecurity and humanity of Harry, and a Hollywood brat version would have had UK audiences setting fire to the cinema.<br/><br/>I both enjoyed the film enormously, and on reflection consider that, although it was a very easy box office success, it was actually, I suspect, a very difficult project."

","OK, first off I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the book, so perhaps I am biased!  However, I went with people who knew nothing of Harry Potter et al but they enjoyed it as much (if not more than) myself.<br/><br/>
The children in the film are amazing.  Probably Harry Potter himself is the most colourless at times, but this too is in keeping with the flawless character - Hermione and Ron are both excellent, and not at all 'stagey'. The adults, of course, are of the very highest calibre, even if you do come away with the feeling that Alan Rickman didn't have enough to do as Snape. Robbie Coltrane is very memorable as Hagrid.<br/><br/>I loved practically everything about this film, the special effects, whilst very good, do not intrude too much, even though I do feel the Quidditch match did go on for a bit too long.  The start of the book, when Harry is with the Dursleys, is heavily abridged, but then you cannot include everything.<br/><br/>The film is long, and by the end I have to admit a few of the younger children in the audience were getting restless.  However, an eight-year-old boy I know was absolutely enchanted for the whole two and a half hours. The pace is fast, but then there's a lot of book to get through!!<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of book adaptations, however I can easily say this is one of the very best.  Of course, as usual you come away thinking about your favourite bits that they missed out, but that just encourages you to re-read the book.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a wonderful film, I wholeheartedly recommend it.  It's imaginative, and if it doesn't bewitch you, nothing will!!"

"andycole","7","0","0","12 November 2001"," Good, but could have been better
","A very good attempt, fast action all the way, perfect for the younger viewers to keep them enthralled through the longer than average running time, but not really thorough enough to please the people who appreciate the intricate and intimate relationships between the central characters and their backgrounds. The amount of 'family history' missing from Harry and Ron's lives completeley changes their characters; you don't know why Harry is living in a cupboard or what a terrible upbringing he's had, you don't realise how the Weasley family's financial struggle is a constant embarrassment for Ron, so the 2 boys seem a lot happier and carefree than the books portray them.<br/><br/>Voldemort, the most evil, feared and one of the most famous wizards in the magical world is hardly mentioned and you don't get the feeling of how times have changed. Professor Dumbledore is a central and well developed character in the book and is portrayed as wise but eccentric and playful. None of this showed in his film character, so the conversation between him and Harry at the end of the movie is a bit of 'catch-up'. Similar missing character development can be seen in Neville Longbottom, so his fifteen seconds of fame at the end are meaningless, and Professor Snape, who you don't have any reason to hate other than his sneering voice.<br/><br/>Couldn't fault the acting, great casting, especially with the adult characters. Shame the kids all sound posh, though. Note to Americans, we don't all sound like that!<br/><br/>On the plus side, the effects capture the magical creatures and flying antics beautifully, though I feel just a little bit more effort could have made the magic wands a bit more 'magic'.<br/><br/>In summary, fast moving, a little too fast, and probably an additional well chosen 10 minutes of character development would have helped to please more people.  After reading some of the other comments here, I can see that people who haven't read the books found it hard going in the beginning, until the action at hogwarts got going. The thing is, all the plot-building at the beginning is there for a reason so I'd say to those people: You should have read the book!<br/><br/>I just hope there'll be an extended version when it comes out on DVD!<br/><br/>If I hadn't read the book, 8 out of 10.

All the reviews I read about it were positive, and ""true to the book"".<br/><br/>As true as it was, I felt somehow very disappointed. I felt that there were some parts that should have been included, but were excluded in the film. While I understand that it's difficult to cram the entire book into a 145-minute film, some of the important essences of the book - of who Harry is, of why he is so important to the wizarding world, of why Draco is so hateful, of why Voldemort is so feared - was not shown well enough. I also felt that Hagrid's closeness to the three kids in the book was not well portrayed on-screen.<br/><br/>And frankly, I was very suprised that the players could get away with all the fouls committed during the Quidditch match in the film!<br/><br/>If the film was to stand on its own, I think it is a decent job.

It had ended far too soon for me. From the beginning with Dumbledor and his amazing lighter (or is it non-lighter?) all the way to the large scale version of Wizard's Chess, this was done with such taste and was meant to please both the child and the adult.

","First of all I have to say I haven't yet read J K Rowling's books, so I am in the apparently unenlightened position of not feeling it necessary to compare this film to the books. But since this is, as I understand it, a *film* internet database, I would hope that this puts me in a better position than many of this film's critics here. <br/><br/>Might I make a token suggestion to those who write reviews on this site (with AMERICAN PSYCHO, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, and - no doubt - THE LORD OF THE RINGS in mind) to judge a film as a film, not as an adaptation of a book. By all means mention a film's faithfulness or overall quality in relation to its source material, but please don't define that as whether or not it is a good or bad film. Believe it or not, some people went to see HARRY POTTER who hadn't read the book. Does the quality of APOCALYPSE NOW make Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' a bad book? Does the dreadfulness of CHILDREN OF THE CORN (and its innumerable sequels) make Stephen King's original short story the greatest literary work of all time?<br/><br/>What I saw when I went to see this film was not a masterpiece or work of genius. But it was a fun, exciting, and immensely enjoyable family film. Although it was perhaps overlong (a good twenty minutes could probably have been snipped without any damage to narrative or characterisation), it was charming and witty and engaging all the way. The SFX were no better or worse than one might have expected, but the sets and costumes were outstanding, with a real feel for England and the public school ambience that Hogwarts seemed to represent. John Williams' score was also memorable.<br/><br/>The main criticism I had of the film (and, aside from the length, the *only* substantive criticism that I can see if you forget the books) is that some of the acting by the children was a bit ropey on occasion, even by young Daniel Radcliffe as Harry. But fortunately the likes of Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, Ian Hart, John Hurt, and Alan Rickman keep it well above sea level. <br/><br/>It is certainly not a ground-breaking or life-changing film in any way, but anyone who has an open mind and open heart should enjoy this exuberant and good-natured magical adventure."

","It seems that this movie has won the hearts of people who have read the book, and NOT read it. But I must say that this was way too slimmed down. For example, we see one Quidditch game (if you don't know, I'll explain later) to the books plural number (I wasn't counting the Quidditch games). Also, there was a conversation on Harry at the beginning of the book, and I think it was also between Uncle Vernon (I forget, is that his name?) and some other person that I don't remember the name of. I also remember Dumbledore choking on the ear wax flavored Bertie Botts' Every Flavor Beans (ICK!). The snake at the beginning had more speech... we never see Dudley's gang... the Midnight Duel's gone... Norbert (Hagrid's dragon) flies away, and they don't attempt to sned him to Ron's brother... the list goes on... Why omit so much stuff? My guess is that the filmmakers didn't want to bore the kids with a 3-hour film. However, younger children would be scared away by the scary moments, and I think that the remainder have sat through ""Titanic."" (Don't ask me why. I hate the movie, and haven't even seen it!)<br/><br/>Okay, on to other things. Why not add in a few things? I wanted to see Nearly Headless Nick (John Cleese) push his head off (it's still hanging there--that's how he's nearly headless), put it back, and exclaim, ""Thank you, God!

","This adaption of J.K. Rowlings wonderful book Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone was easily one of the best book-to-movie adaptions I have ever seen.  Chris Columbus masterfully was able to retain the feel and emotion of the book, as well as evoke the power and majesty the book wrought, while remaining fresh and exciting, not just a stale by-the-numbers account of what the book said.<br/><br/>The thing that always amazed me about the Harry Potter series was its ability to enchant young and old alike.  It is a masterful work in that the plots and characters, while complex and compelling for the adult, remain reachable and invigorating for the child.  On the reverse, while this is clearly a book written with children in mind, an adult does not come away feeling like one has read a ""kids book"". The same holds true for the movie.  It is certainly much richer and imaginative than most of the tripe calling itself childrens movies today, but adults do not feel cheated.  <br/><br/>I won't speak about specific scenes or character developments, although I guarantee those who read the book will see favorite scenes deleted - its still a 2 1/2  hour movie, but goodness, they couldn't fit EVERYTHING in there!  <br/><br/>A wonderful movie I encourage everyone to see before the biggest movie of all time - the Lord of the Rings - comes out."

","I didn't read the book.  I'm not saying that to show how unique this perspective will be, I'm just saying that I can not comment on how it compares to the book, nor do I think anyone ever should with an adaptation.<br/><br/>I've never liked Chris Columbus.  He's always lacked any sort of vision or style...unless unbelievably hokey is a style.  But with this, he obviously had a good script (still not commenting on the book) to work with.  With this movie, we have our typical first chapter in what is obviously going to be a series.  It's not leaving you with a cliffhanger or anything like that, but one can never get away from the feeling that this is all set up for things that will happen in the distant future.  Well, maybe not too distant, but beyond the end of this movie.<br/><br/>So the real challenge for this movie is to make us care about what might happen to these characters later on.  I suppose that was accomplished to a certain extent.  Mostly I was rather interested in the story and hoping that, before the future get here, these kids take a few more acting lessons. Don't get me wrong, they are quite good, but that little girl needs to stop over annunciating every last word.  Outside of that, I see some great potential.  Is it cruel to pick on these defenseless kids?  Maybe, but I'm not the one who put them on screen with some of the best British actors ever.  I know if I was twelve years old, I wouldn't want to be up against Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt, Maggie Smith, and Richard Harris. (wow)<br/><br/>Next, I know it's a kids' movie, but do we really need a scene where, one after another, the three kids show their individual talents?  It's mildly contrived (we need some one who has studied, now a good broom flyer, and finally we need that comic relief guy who plays chess).  And my final complaint before I get into the good stuff are the names of the characters themselves.  The names of bad people and things are stuff like:  Draco, Voldemort, and Slytherin.  This is much like what Hawthorne used to name his characters (Chillingsworth anyone) and it's just plain silly.  Think of it this way, would the name Hannibal Lecter conjure up a bad image in your mind before you saw The Silence of the Lambs?  Maybe a little, but not to the point where you would immediately know that, ""he's the bad guy...BOOOOOOO!!!""<br/><br/>As for what was good, I don't mean to repeat what others have said, but that Quidditch game was great.  I think it really got the feel that it was going for.  The effects were very good for the type of movie that this was.  Sure, they didn't look all too realistic, but it is a movie about magicians and wizards, so let's not get too carried away.  And, like I said before, you can't deny that the story was interesting.  I thought it opened up a whole new world where things were different enough for us to continue asking questions.  But it wasn't so erratic that you just gave up on following any of it (see Tomb Raider).  Overall, it was a rather enjoyable experience.  I do wish I had seen it that first weekend though.  I ended up seeing it this afternoon (a Monday) and I was the only one in the theater.  This does need to be seen with other people.<br/><br/>And most importantly, while that Macaulay Culkin look-alike, Draco, came dangerously close, there was no Jar Jar Binks!  HOORAY!"

","Having never read any of the books, I did not know what to expect when I went to view this film. All I knew about it was what I read in the newspapers, and saw on the news. This movie is magnificent, and will surely become a classic!! The story, special effects, and even the unknown actors, all do a wonderful job in this great film.<br/><br/>Harry is an orphaned boy of a witch and wizard, who is sent to live with his aunt and uncle. However, at his eleventh (sorry if I'm wrong about his age) birthday, he gets summoned to become a wizard at a wizard's school. This is where all the fun begins.<br/><br/>Unlike many of the other reviewers here, as stated above, I have never read the book, so I cannot compare the two. However, I was entertained for the two and a half hours that the movie lasted. The special effects were great, and the scene where Harry and the boys are playing some sort of sport on their broomsticks is just fantastic. It made me think of the podrace scene in ""The Phantom Menace"".<br/><br/>Everyone should definately give this movie a chance. Really enjoyable for all."

","Like a lot of people, I was very excited when I saw the trailers for ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"".  I have not read the books by J.K. Rowling but  can certainly appreciate the hold they have exerted over the minds of our culture, and besides, the film just looked pretty damn good.  Like a lot of people, I have now seen the film.  Unlike a lot of people, I know that the bloom is more or less off of the rose.  <br/><br/>""Sorcerer's Stone"", the story of a neglected orphan's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is exactly what a film of this type should not be:  EARTHBOUND.  The whole time I was watching it (and a long time it was, the film runs an I-can't-believe-kids-are- sitting-through-this-when-I-barely-can 152 minutes), I kept wondering what a director like Terry Gilliam or Tim Burton would have made of this material, someone who knows how to put a fantasy world on the screen in all of its foreboding mystery and magic.  Chris Columbus, who gave the world such dazzling forays into the fantastical as ""Stepmom"" and ""Adventures In Babysitting"", just doesn't seem to have been the right man for the job.  The film has all the requisite effects and magical happenings present and accounted for, but that extra special whatever it is that makes a film like this truly memorable is just not there.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, I haven't read Rowling's book, so I don't know if she made more of the characters than is done here.  Overall, however, I felt like screenwriter Steve Kloves (also responsible for the tedious ""Wonder Boys"") short-changed a lot of Rowling's most interesting figures.  Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), Hogwarts' imposing potions instructor, has nothing to do but stand around and glower imperiously.  Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter's rival, is evil, I guess, because he has a widow's peak; he really doesn't do anything besides scowl at Harry.  Even young Master Potter himself could have used more zip, even though newcomer Daniel Radcliffe gives a fine, unaffected portrayal.  These deficiencies are especially egregious considering the running time, much of which is taken up by characters explaining arcane magical concepts to one another (I'm serious about what I said earlier; all I ever hear is that kids have no attention span...how on earth are they getting through this thing?).<br/><br/>What's more, the film never really makes good on its central conceit.  This is, after all, a film about a SCHOOL FOR WIZARDS!  That's a cool idea in ways I can't even describe, but ""Sorcerer's Stone"" doesn't really do enough to pay it off.  We see precious little of the actual instruction, the whys and wherefores of wizardry, and thus the film almost seems to be shying away from its central concept.  <br/><br/>This is not to say that there are not many things to admire about ""Sorcerer's Stone"".  The production design is everything one could ask for, Hogwarts an imposing old manse of stone and spiraling stairways (and be careful...the staircases move!).  The special effects are generally impressive, from big set pieces like the Quidditch game to little grace notes like the constantly shifting paintings on the Hogwarts walls.  John Williams contributes yet another of his fine scores, complete with a theme you'll walk out humming.  In addition to Radcliffe, several other actors also acquit themselves admirably.  Robbie Coltrane invests Hogwarts giant Hagrid with blustery charm, Maggie Smith is a fine, tartly English MacGonagal, but newcomer Rupert Grint practically walks off with the film as Harry's friend Ron Weasley.  He has one of those faces that always looks apologetic, and his lines (""She seriously has to work on her priorities"") are the best in the picture.<br/><br/>Still, my mind keeps returning to one word...""disappointment"".  Does it even matter?  The film's already made ten truckloads of money, and kids who must have fallen asleep during it (as I'll admit I did) are still saying it's their favorite all-time movie.  Work has already begun on a sequel, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"", and there was enough I liked about ""Sorcerer's Stone"" that I'll probably check out this second film, too. Remember, though:  you can't fool me thrice.  If the follow-up bottoms out, I won't be back for ""Prisoner of Azkaban"".  <br/><br/>Hmmm...maybe they could get Joel Schumacher to direct... ;)"

The character development went along rather well, and the details shown in the movie were a beauty to behold.

"Denver53","9","0","0","26 November 2001"," Very good start to a series; some people just whine too much
","I am more than a little surprised to see critics of Harry Potter grousing about bad chess moves and details from the book being left out. Lighten up. A movie never includes every detail from a book, nor does it get every small matter of opinion (i.e. chess strategy) correct. A movie entertains, and when it comes from a book, it creates a living world that more of less matches the world the reader had imagined. Harry Potter #1 does a very good job of bringing this world to the screen.<br/><br/>I have read all of the books, so I am aware that my mind may have automatically filled in details that someone who had not read the books might be puzzled by. Even so, the movie makes as much sense as a fantasy/fairy tale can, and you have a good time watching it. I won't get into the plot because either you already know, or if you don't, trying to explain it here wouldn't do the movie (or book) justice.<br/><br/>I do agree with one criticism that the movie doesn't allow the viewer learn much about the main characters. The Big Three (Harry, Hermione and Ron) are pretty much thrust into the movie and you learn what you can from their actions more than from any exposition. A fourth character, Neville Longbottom, in particular seems to suddenly appear and disappear and then appear again rather awkwardly. But again, that's OK. This movie was 2.5 hours long; it included as many details as it could. At some point, reality dictated that some things be left out. I have a hunch we'll learn more about these characters in the next movie and beyond.<br/><br/>The Quidditch game was far more exciting than the ridiculously slow and cliched ""pod race"" in Star Wars"" The Phantom Menace. In fact, Harry Potter is a far better movie all around. It certainly opens a new world of imagination. It deserves a 9."

","To start off, let me just tell you that I am a great fan of J.K. Rowlings' books and they have helped me through many a rough day during the last couple of years. The books are to my believe, in a unique top 10 of books side by side with Tolkien's masterpieces and the new book ""Artemis Fowl"" by Eion Colfer.<br/><br/>When that said, let's get on to the film! Well.. to say at least, I went to see the film with a feeling that it HAD to disappoint me. Little did I know that I was in for a surprise...<br/><br/>The film is - in general - a film which sticks to the story. Without mentioning the total absence of Madam Pomfrey and a too old Professor McGonagall, the story line is good. One thing you are going to enjoy is the scene with Quidditch.

I only hope that in the weeks to come Emma and Rupert get as much recognition as Daniel is going to get.<br/><br/>I did think that two and a half hours for was a little to long for a kids film, knowing how hard it is for them to concentrate for that long.  However after seeing it I can confidently say that not one of the kids in the cinema, and it was packed to the rafters, appeared to be anything but glued to the screen for the whole time.

"theshape79","10","0","0","26 November 2001"," Great movie, but wheres Peeve's?
","I have to say this movie utterly left me flabbergasted. Not having read J. K. Rowlings immensly popular novels, and ignoring the jeers of my friends I went to see this movie with small expectations and returned a huge fan of Harry Potter. Where to begin with what the movie does right. First off is the casting of only British actors especially in the leading roles. To me thinking of some American actor stumbling around as Potter or Granger faking a British accent would have been just terrible. Thankfully Chris Columbus who seems to be the last person I would be praising after Nine Months, decided to steer off from that Hollywood movie machine idea. And speaking of the actors, they all do a wonderful job fleshing out the characters especially the young leads. Daniel Radcliffe finds just the right note making Harry Potter a character every audience member can envy and cheer at the same time time. Emma Watson plays the feisty Hermione Granger almost exactly as she is written in the book with that little bit of tartness I think most young girls have at that age( at least my sister does anyway.) Tom Felton hits just the right note of pure arrogance and prissyness as Draco Malfoy that you just want some to stand up and slap him during the movie. And Rupert Grint has fun delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie while also becoming equally as heroic as his two counterparts when the time calls for it. As for their older counterparts, they all play to greater range than would usually be called for in a movie of this type. Richard Harris is a standout as headmaster Albus Dumbeldore and Maggie Smith shines as Minerva McGonagle. Their not acting because their grandchildren are fans of the books, their in the movie because they believe in what they are performing. Another thing to note is Hogwarts itself. Everything is set to the screen amazingly intricate detail from the great hall to some of the classrooms themselves. Of special note, one of my favorite parts from the book is also one of the best set designs in recent memory, the huge wizard's chess board under Hogwarts. I also liked the fact that they didn't point out most of the special effects (i.e. ghosts, and moving pictures.) Some of these add too the visual flair of Hogwart's while enhancing the overall setting. When they do focus on special effects some are grand and exciting like the quidditch match (WOW) while others just fail to impress like Fluffy the three headed dog. Another thing, and this is very minor mind you is the exclusion of Peeves the poltergeist. As I found him to be one of the funner characters I wish they could have added him somewhere in the movie. Perhaps in one of the scenes involving Harry and his friends sneaking around the school at night while being followed by Mr. Filch the schools caretaker, he could have popped up. Maybe? Anyway thats just a small complaint to an otherwise terrific film. Sure its long, but trust me its well worth the price of the ticket. Take the kids, they might have as much fun as you will watching it."

They were simply there. In the movie Seamus Finnigan( Devon Murray) provided comic relief while Oliver Wood (Biggerstaff) was there to inspire Harry about Quidditch. All in all the casting was very well done and I hope to see many of the same cast members in any later movies."

","The most celebrated fantasy book of our time has come to the screen but maybe you were  already aware of that.<br/><br/>I liked the movie but then I don't think it would have been posible not to like a film based on Rowling's brilliant story.  The characters leapt from the page right from the start--like the portraits and photos in the wizard world, they were already moving in our minds.<br/><br/>Don't read further if you haven't seen the movie or plan to and don't want to hear specific movie criticism before you go...<br/><br/>I love all the wizardy atmosphere that was a fun part of the series and right up the special-effects-minded Hollywood alley but the film's continuity lapsed somewhere during the trio's search for the sorcerer's stone until Harry's climactic duel with Voldemort.<br/><br/>You can almost hear the pages rustling.  The three go here and there--not because they really are on to something that the theater audience can follow but because that's the way it goes in the book.  If that continues in the sequel, look for Pottermania to drop off big-time at the box office.<br/><br/>You still need to craft a story for the screen and, as good as Rowling's books are, you can't use everything she puts in or the movie would last for hours and hours (some say this one does already).  So...somebody's got to undertake the job of reworking wizardry for the big screen, not just regurgitating a best-selling book.<br/><br/>Here's a vote to favor the freewheeling humor that makes Harry a hit with young and old alike.  The Star Wars canteena scenes (gruesome faces and the like) can be thrown in for effect, of course, but don't plan the whole bloody movie around them.<br/><br/>The quidditch game, for example, reminded me of the sequence in the last ""Star Wars"" movie when the kid won the rocket race.  It's all effects without much concern for genuine drama.  Harry needed to have practiced or something for us to believe that the little blighter was the real deal up there on his broom.  Otherwise, it's just a cartoon and he's supposed to win.<br/><br/>You can come back now if you've been ignoring all this because you don't fancy some ninny spoiling it for you...<br/><br/>There's a lot of good stuff in ""Harry Potter""--the movie.  Some nice acting--particularly Snape, the custodian (with his red-eyed cat) and Hagrid.  Richard Harris and Maggie Smith are both wonderful.  The kids are good, too--when they can tear loose of the director's reliance on going by the book.<br/><br/>Conclusion: book, A; movie, B--and you could do a whole lot worse than that."

"Janita Dusbee","9","0","0","26 November 2001"," Everything I didn't expect
","Like most people I was really worried about a number of things. First, of course, wether the movie would (or could) remain faithful to the book. This was not too bad. It was a pity for me that they didn't keep in all of the details, but I can understand this, because it would turn into a 5 or 6-hour movie if they would, and that, of course, is way too long. Second, I also had my doubts about the director, yet then again, his Home-Alone-films are great for children. Critics may dislike this kind of movie, but children don't, so why worry about that? Bu I would not like to see Harry Potter turn into a boy who starts crying his eyes out every three minutes. Fortunately, he didn't. Good for him. Third, the special effects. I have seen a lot of movies, with or without special effects, and from my point of view, they're rather disappointing. Therefor, I was absolutely satisfied with the effects of the troll and the quidditch-match. Fourth, the actors. I think nobody looks more like Harry Potter than Daniel Radcliffe. For a child actor, his acting is great. But my favorite is Rupert Grind as Ron Weasly. He is exactly like portrayed in the book. Emma Watson, who plays Hermione Granger, looks a but other than I had imagined after reading the book, but she acts exactly like J.K. Rowling described in her books. Alan Rickman, being one of my personal favorites, is the perfect embodyment of professor Snape (my favorite in the books!!!). It's a shame he doesn't get to show how mean he really is. Maggy Smith as professor McGonagal fits the part perfect, and this also goes for Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid. Overall, I think this movie will make it to my favorite-list. 9/10"

","One of the strange things about this movie is that although I left the cinema grinning from ear to ear, I did feel that it would not have stood alone without the books. Some people who have seen this movie but not read the books will undoubtedly say that they could not really become immersed in the experience properly - and this is very true. From the outset, I felt that many of the touches required familiarity with the subject material - the sorting hat and the stigma attached to the Slytherin House for instance, is something that is explained fully in the books, but not at all in the film.<br/><br/>My summary says brilliant - and this is precisely what this movie is. It has brought well-loved characters out of a book and onto the big screen. Harry, Ron and Hermione shine throughout the movie, and the acting is superb, especially from people who are so young. The fact that the movie and the book are so closely intertwined does not detract from this movie - in fact, since it encourages the viewer to read the books to find out more, it can only be a good thing and can only help to promote reading in the way JK Rowling intended.<br/><br/>A must see - but more importantly, a must read!<br/><br/>8/10"
"John K.-2","Null","0","0","12 November 2001"," Should Christians let their kids see this movie?
","This review is mainly intended for Christian parents who are unsure whether they should let their kids go and see this film. There are a number of stories circulating in the Christian community -- almost none of them good -- about Harry Potter books and their author, J.K. Rowling. Many of these stories are unsubstantiated and at least one is outright falsehood (see www.ship-of-fools.com/Myths/index.html) ... but any book or movie that seems to glorify witchcraft and wizardry is bound to cause legitimate concerns among Christian parents. This review concentrates on the movie itself.<br/><br/>The short answer is ... that there isn't a short answer. This movie in itself is comparatively innocuous (that is, ""comparative"" with the contents of many modern films & TV). The 'dark spiritual' overtones are only slightly nastier than Darth Vader and the 'Force', the theme of the film is good battling against evil, and the overall message of the film is that life at boarding school is great, and working magic is a bit like working with technology or electrical gadgets - lots of fun if you're careful to obey the rules, dangerous if you don't. It also happens to be a very good film, well-made and with several clever technical effects. The actors (especially the children) are also excellent. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie inevitably portrays witches and wizards as (mostly) nice people who are slightly superior to ordinary folk; the concept of using magic to solve problems may well capture some young minds; and there's always the problem that if the kids get interested in Harry Potter, they may choose to read all the books ... and everyone I've asked agrees that the books get 'darker' as the series progresses. In other words, you risk starting your kids on a journey whose ending isn't yet known (the last 3 books aren't written) but which can't be considered to focus primarily on what is good, holy, pure, right and honourable. [Mind you, the same could be said of many other authors ...]<br/><br/>So in conclusion: if you are strongly opposed to *any* influence of witchcraft or wizardry in your home, then don't let your kids see this movie. However, there's worse stuff on TV and in many books, so if you let them look at that type of thing, you're being inconsistent. Make your own judgement based on how imaginative you kids are and whether they are old enough to discern the differences between the film and real life."

","Hmmmm... I went to this film with a totally objective frame of mind, having not read any of the books or really knowing much about the plot.<br/><br/>
Once I saw Chris Columbus was directing it, I wondered whether the fantastical elements the film promised would come closer to the great potential he showed when he wrote 'Young Sherlock Holmes' or when he COMPLETELY lost the plot with 'Stepmom'.  Unfortunately, I think the film leans more towards 'Stepmom', though not sentimental it is patchy with little attention to character development.  It was an inspired idea to get Steve Kloves to write the screenplay (who wrote 'Wonder Boys' but the film seemed really compromised.<br/><br/>I can see through the ideas that JK Rowling must have put in the book- what an imagination she must have, you can see that readers would be totally transfixed.  But it didn't translate well, despite the 11-year old I took with me who said it was just how he pictured it was.  In a way, I guess that is where the film succeeded, it's fans weren't disappointed by what they saw, but this is also the problem, because what must have worked well enough in the book to make it such a success seems stilted and full of obvious CGI effects to distract from what is happening.  The movie seemed like a series of marvelous set pieces all executed really quickly.  It delved right into the story without much notice to time or place.  Nothing was left to the imagination- the first-year students see the paintings moving in the hall, a nice background effect, and it must be pointed out, 'Look, the pictures are moving!'  Harry, Ron and Hermoine climb some stairs which starts to move: 'Look, the stairs are moving, don't you remember, the stairs move!'  What do the filmmakers take the audience for, idiots?  I found the preview for Lord of the Rings more enchanting than the film, because it seemed really special, magical, scary and uncompromising.  Only time will tell if this is the case.<br/><br/>The casting was very uneven.  Ron Weasley was the only one of the three kids who had any real acting skill, Harry and Hermoine were so bland, very one-note actors.  You would also think that with Maggie Smith's reputation she would be able to handle a consistent Scottish accent.  Robbie Coltrane and Richard Harris had the authority that the others lacked.  All those 30-second British actor cameos were distracting... look- its John Cleese... oh, he's gone.  Look, it's Julie Walters with 2 lines... she's gone.  It would have been more interesting to cast unknowns who look more like what is described in the book, not cameos for the sake of it.  Maybe the fact it was backed, adapted and directed by Americans made them feel obligated to cast known actors to make it seem more like a genuine British film?<br/><br/>What was REALLY shocking was the stereotyping.  Why do the scary characters all have cockney accents, and what was the story with the bankers who looked coincidentally like the Jews as portrayed in Nazi propaganda films?  That was really jarring.<br/><br/>Overall, a conventional, stilted opportunity filled with good ideas that never take off thanks to a magic-free adaptation."

","Having read all the books some time ago I was looking forward to this film for some time. Luckily I managed to get preview tickets and waited in line with the rest of the audience which were all little kids and their parents. Any way the film started and there was a cheer from the crowd would it be as good as their expectations?<br/><br/>Well in a word yes. The acting was pretty good actually with Ron being the pick of the youngsters. The special effects were a little disappointing at times but Fluffy was very good. The overall scenes in the film were spectacular with hogwarts living up to my hopes and quidditch being as exciting as it should. The story I think was a bit rushed but having read the book it filled in the gaps, but whether it would be as good if i hadn't read the book i don't know.<br/><br/>Overall 9/10, the only down points being Snape didn't do enough and with alan rickman acting he should have done more and the other point being the special effects in places."

","This movie is very moving, funny and scary, which is a very good combination. Daniel Radcliffe, who potrays as Harry, has done a brilliant job indeed. Rupert Grint, who potrays Harry's best friend, Ron, has great lines and is very funny. Emma Watson, who potrays another of Harry's best friend, Hermione, made me irritated, which is good because you're suppose to be irritated! The adult actors are great. They're experienced and you can expect lots from them if you see the movie. I'm not ashamed to say this but I cried during some parts of the movie. It was so emotional and touching, and I laughed really loudly that the whole crowd followed suit when something funny happens. This movie is a must see--I'm giving it 5 stars."

","I enjoyed this film, even if it could`nt fully match the warmth and humor of the book. Steven Kloves did a very fine job, and I am sure he did write much more dialogue to build up the Characters and the relationships, than we have heard within the movie. I am also sure this had to be left out for : a movie is ""a story told in pictures"", and the filmmakers had to make sure all spectacular plots with their  special effects the audience would expect have to be in. My children would have had the patience to sit for another hour, so had I, and I hope the following movies take their time to transport more of the warmth and humour of the books to the screen. Harry, Ron, Hermiony,-the whole crew are fantastic and capable of all emotional expressions Chris Columbus would have to ask for within the story...! Nevertheless, the movie is well done and a great success- and it deserves it."

","For those of us who know the book backwards and forwards, at first glance the movie may seem a little disappointing.  It's hard to watch the movie without thinking with each scene ""oh, they've cut this out"", or ""they changed this a little bit"".  Much of the wit in the book - like Lee Jordan's hilarious commentary of the quidditch match, and the fight between Harry, Ron and Draco (and Scabbers!) on the train ride to Hogwarts - is missing in the film, which is unfortunate.  However, on second viewing, you know what to expect in the film (and what not to expect), and thus it is much easier to see the film for the enchantment that it is!  Dazzling sets and special effects make the film a visual stunner. Daniel Radcliffe excels at bringing Harry Potter to life, and even better, he has real chemistry with Rupert Grint's Ron - who, as the comedic relief, steals virtually every scene he's in - and Emma Watson's Hermione, who nails the character's know-it-all attitude perfectly.  Chris Columbus - who directed the incredibly awful ""Home Alone"" series - wisely avoids sappiness with ""Sorcerer's Stone"" and instead captures the dark tone that runs through Rowling's novel.  The movie-makers have done an excellent job at bringing the first novel in the Harry Potter series to life.  Can't wait to see what they do with the even better novel, ""Chamber of Secrets""!"

","I sat in a multiplex theater....down near the front as all the higher seats were taken already. We went on Day 1 and had purchased our tickets online 2 weeks ahead.

"Censura","Null","0","0","23 November 2001"," Harry Potter: Not the best movie ever, but easily the best book-to movie adaption.
","Let's go to the movie checklist: Does Harry Potter have a great cast of actors? Yes. Harry Potter has probably the best cast I have seen in a long time: Alan Rickman (Severus Snape), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore), and John Cleese (Nearly headless Nick). Then there's the three main characters who, for how little acting experience two of them had, did a pretty good job. Emma Watson fit the role of Harmione, and my vision of what Hermione acted, and looked like very well, and Rupert Grint fit the part of Ron Weasley perfectly, and neither Rupert, or Emma have had any experience acting in movies. Daniel Radcliffe on the other hand, was merely 'ok'. He wasn't great, and came across to me as being very dull, and boring, and more 'mugglelike' than most muggles. To top it off, Daniel's voice cracked halfway through the movie, and they were forced to voice over the rest of it, that is why it seemed dubbed at the last part of the movie.<br/><br/>Back to the point, does Harry Potter have a good storyline that keeps the veiwer interested, and moves along quickly. This is a solid maybe. As for the moving along quickly, if consider a good butt-numbing 160 some minutes quickly, then this is perfect for you, but not all people consider that quickly (me being one of them). However, the storyline was good, not quite as good as the book becuase they cut out a lot of little details wich seem to add more depth to the story, but it was nonetheless very good, and it kept you interested enough that you didn't realize that your watch had stopped.<br/><br/>The musical score: unfortunetly for me, i can't quite give a good or bad score on this becuase i was interested enough in the story, that the slow, solemn music that was scattered throughout the movie didn't catch my attention. This isn't a bad thing, or a good thing. On the good hand, people might not be as critical of the music, becuase I know for a fact that it set a certain mood for me. On the bad side, however, some would argue that ther e isn't very many peices of music in the movie, or that you couldn't notice them very much. So this really depends on the taste of the veiwer.<br/><br/>Graphics, and animation sequence: I wan't to give this a good score so badly, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I liked the movie, but the animation sequences made Shrek look GREAT. Some of the worst animation sequences featured Neville falling from the stone gargoyle, and Harry's encounter with the Centuar in the forest.<br/><br/>Now, for the last, some things that I really didn't like about the movie: Neville, Neville, Neville. In my mind, Neville wasn't chubby, and he wasn't a total moron per se. I pictured him more as a short, skinny, geek/dork/screw up type of person. In my mind, the people who choose Neville for the movie, really screwed up.<br/><br/>So there you have it, in a nutshell with no spoilers, and i didn't write in any of my opinions until the last 2 paragraphcs. So you can decide for yourself whether Neville fits or not, and whether the animation is up to snuff or not."

","HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE: A-<br/><br/>HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is a dazzling ride full of fun magic and spellbinding wizardry. It captures the very essence of the book and never sells out.<br/><br/>If case you don't know (and only about three of you don't) HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is about a young boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). His parents were killed in a ""car accident"" and he is being brought up by his nasty uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths) and wretched aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw). They have a son named Dudley (Harry Melling). As his life progresses he becomes more and more mature for his age. One day, he receives a letter from Hogwarts. After many failed attempts by Vernon to hide the letters, he finally meets Hagrid (perfectly played by Robbie Coltrane). Harry finds out he's a wizard and he's to be trained at Hogwart's School of Wizardry and Witchcraft (or something to that degree).<br/><br/>
When he arrives, Harry meets Ron Weasly (Rubert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). They quickly become friends. At Hogwarts there's the Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris), Professor/Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith), Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart), Professor Flitwick (Warwick Davis), and the mean Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). I'll stop there because either you know the rest or you have to see it to enjoy it.<br/><br/>I admit, when word of HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE first came out I thought ""Oh, no. A Harry Potter movie?"" I thought that it was the most overrated piece of rubbish of the nineties. But as release date neared I got sucked in. I read the book and thought it was great. I then saw the movie and thought it was great. I'm not going to sit here and give it any more hype, God knows it has enough of that.<br/><br/>The casting is one of the major stong points in the movie. If it didn't have the right cast, everything could have gone to hell. Daniel Radcliffe fits Harry for about the first two thirds of the movie, then his voice changes and everything is ruined. But he does just fine and has a good career ahead of him. I especially liked Ron. Grint was perfect for the role because he had the personality of Ron. Hermione is played perfectly by Watson. The best casting choice, though is Alan Rickman as Snape. He plays him just on the borderline of snapping. He is creepy and intriguing, mystifying and scary.<br/><br/>
The plot is an original one and I'm happy that the writers stuck to the book.They kept what needed to be kept and discarded what was good material in the book, but what wouldn't work in the movie. The special effects are fun and dreamlike which adds to the movie because that's what the movie really is, a dream, a fantasy.<br/><br/>HARRY POTTER AND SORCERER'S STONE is loyal to the book, won't disappoint fans, create new fans, is entertaining, has charm, wit, and excitement. Nothing more needs to be said."

","Being an avid reader of books my trips to the cinema often end up in tears where characterisations, plot and often the entire shebang are sacrificed to produce a cinematic epic. Usually to the films great detriment. Being one of the many adults I see reading the Harry Potter series of books on their way into work I was excited but also worried about this foray into the world of the big screen.<br/><br/>This film only shows you how wrong you can be. Two and a half hours of celluloid magic later I was delighted to the point of wanting to buy another ticket! This was sheer cinematic genius and obviously very tightly controlled by the books author which it didn't suffer from at all! In later discussions with friends we identified the parts of the book that weren't there but all agreed that the film didn't need them!<br/><br/>The young cast are all brilliant and are convincing as the characters from the book. In fact all the characters are so well played that they don't destroy the pictures built up in your mind having read the book but enhance them. Richard Harris portrays Dumbledore with equal gravitas and humour and is a delight. Maggie Smith is excellent as the venerable McGonagall and Alan Rickman is his sneering best as Professor Snape who is restrained enough not to overegg the pudding. But the magic of Robbie Coltrane as the bumbling and kind Hagrid is unequalled. This was a masterpiece of casting and the sheer force of his acting prowess carries this character off beautifully. The film is carried by its characters and plot, both of which are well developed and enthralling.<br/><br/>The special effects are so good that you don't really notice them. The sign of a good special effect is when it doesn't become the star of the film itself. The effects in this film really create the suspension of disbelief required to carry it off. Even the Quidditch match allows you to revel in the excitement of the teams flying around on broomsticks without wondering how they did it.<br/><br/>In short this film is an absolute must! I can't think of a more delightful way to spend two and a half hours, whether you are 5 or 50. This film will be making people happy for years to come. It will go down in the annals of film as a true classic."

But I loved all of them after reading the four novels and didn't think I could love them more until I saw the movie.  While I heard others say that they were apprehensive about what ""Hollywood would do to the story,"" after seeing the previews and trailers for the movie, I didn't think it would disappoint me.  It didn't.  I was even more in love with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Hogwarts when I walked out of the theater than when I walked in ... so much so that I missed them and went back to see the movie again two days later ... and again four days after that.

","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was a much-anticipated movie and not just for children but for adults. It's a fantasy story that created a world of magic and wonder for children and for adults it brought back something that many of us have lost; our imagination. <br/><br/>For those of you who have never read any of the books and have no idea what this movie is about (what rock have you been under?), this movie is based off the first book that J.K. Rowling wrote, `Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'. The story revolves around a young boy that discovers he's a wizard. All throughout his life, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) has never been able to explain strange things that happen around him in times of distress. Living with his aunt and uncle, Harry was forced to be nothing more than a servant boy. Although they knew what the cause of these happenings were, they never told Harry and did everything possible to hide his origins. He was never given any kind of attention except when something was needed of him. In fact, his bedroom was the `room under the stairs' and if something strange happened that his aunt or uncle found out about, he would get locked in his room for days or weeks. On his 11th birthday he receives a letter indicating that he's been accepted into Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Magic. Up until this point, Harry had no idea that he was a wizard or that he was the cause of these `strange' happenings. From this moment on, his life changes dramatically as he begins a wonderful journey into the discovery of his abilities and the world of magic.<br/><br/>
Harry Potter is distinctly British and the worst thing that could have happened is for Hollywood to get a hold of it and make it through their own eyes. So when J.K. Rowling rejected the idea of Steven Spielberg directing it without having British actors (especially the lead actor), it was the first step to a successful picture. Nothing against Spielberg and I'm a huge fan of his but this movie depends greatly on the atmosphere that it creates. And part of that atmosphere was having an old British feel to it. What really worked well for this movie was that it followed the book very closely. But then again, anything that strayed from it would have caused mass criticism from children around the world. However that has never stopped directors and producers before but in this case, this was a critical factor and they were true to the book.<br/><br/>I was quite surprised to find out that the three lead child actors are unknowns. In fact, none of them have ever acted and considering that this is their first movie, I think they did an admirable job. Radcliffe, who plays Potter, fits the physical description of Harry Potter to a `T' and his acting is not bad. The young lady who plays Hermione Granger (Emma Watson II) plays the `Miss Know-it-all' quite well although at some points she goes over the top a bit but that's something you have to expect from inexperienced actors. Rupert Grint plays Ron Weasley, the goofy, smart mouthed friend of Potter and Granger. I actually found him quite entertaining to watch. With the way the books are written and the success that this movie has had so far, we can all assume that there will be other Harry Potter movies so I'm sure we'll see these three actors again and only see better and better performances as they gain experience.<br/><br/>
The rest of the cast is a `who's who' of actors. With seasoned actors like Robbie Coltrane, John Cleese, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, etc. it is near impossible to have poor performances. All of these actors played their parts beautifully and true to the characters developed by Rowling. It also helps that they looked like they really got into their parts and the world they were trying to create. I was especially impressed with Rickman's role as Professor Snape, the dark, brooding teacher of potions. The books description of this character is mysterious, moody and a bit slimy and Rickman pulls that off flawlessly. <br/><br/>The one last element that really made this movie was the computer graphics. This is one movie that really required computers to create this world. Like Star Wars, this movie is in a time and place that is unfamiliar to the audience hence its ability to create reality is imperative.<br/><br/>
There is one thing about this movie that I have to mention. It is long. At two and a half hours, this will be a long sit for children so make sure they have gone to the bathroom beforehand. The other thing is that for those adults who have read the books, the movie will feel long. Because the movie follows the book so closely, you know exactly what is going on and how much further the story has to go before the movie comes to an end. I was watching this movie with my sister and brother in-law and their reactions to it were quite different. My sister, who read the book beforehand, while still enjoying it immensely, like I found it rather long. For my brother in-law who's never read the books, found the two and a half hours flash by. So my advice is that for you adults who haven't read the book but are thinking about it, watch the movie first before you read the book or else the movie will feel really long. It won't really matter for the children if they've read the books or not; they'll be fascinated by everything they've read about come to life on the see on the screen. <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It was magical and wondrous and definitely suitable for children and adults. In fact the show that I went to was mostly adults. Happy wizarding!"

","I have not read the Harry Potter novels. I should add a ""yet"" to that sentance, because I made up my mind to read them when I walked out of the cinema. This was a fairy-tale, just the way they are supposed to be! It wasn't too cute or too cartoonish, and it didn't leave out the darker elements. That, for me, means that the makers have respect for the audience. This is the kind of movie that children are supposed to see - something that includes the sad and the scary as well as the happy and funny.<br/><br/>Harry Potter has a very nice Astrid Lindgren-style to it, which I loved, since Lindgren is one of my favorite authors (Mio my Mio, Lionheart Brothers, Ronja, Pippi Longstocking and others). In fact, there were a lot of common elements, like the huge pile of gold coins, the invisibility cloak and not least, the evil presence of Voldemort who somehow brought Night Kato and Tengil to mind: someone so dark he can only be fought by a child.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is truly the masterpiece it was made out to be, athough the movie DID drag out at some points, and it took a little too long for the actual plot to start up. Nevertheless, I'm givning the movie 10/10.<br/><br/>

","As a guy in his fifties who has never read a word of the Potter books, I felt that I needed an excuse to see this children's film, so  together with five other adults  I accompanied the nine year old son of a friend to a Sunday morning showing in north London on the opening weekend.  It was a really fun atmosphere with lots of kids dressed up in pointed hats and coloured cloaks and they cheered when the movie started and applauded at the end.<br/><br/>British one-time primary school teacher Joanne Rowling has now sold some 120 million copies of the first four novels in her planned seven-part saga and apparently managed to ensure that the screen version of her first story stays really close to the book. Although the funding and the director - Chris Columbus of `Home Alone'  are inevitably American, it was shot at classic locations in England and the cast is a wonderful roll call of British character actors and youthful newcomers. Twelve year old Daniel Radcliffe is simply perfect as Harry and the casting is consistently clever from 71 year old Richard Harris as the headmaster Dumbledore to Maggie Smith as Jean Brodie's alter ego<br/><br/>
Like Superman, Batman and Luke Skywalker, Harry is an orphan with exceptional powers, but his training ground  the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  is like no other and given magical form through some brilliant special effects, not least in the furious flying game of Quidditch. The pacing of the movie might have been better but, as a mere `muggle' (someone without special powers), I guess I'm in no position to complain and the kids are going to love all two and a half hours.<br/><br/>Footnote: A couple of days after seeing the film, I caught a train from Platform 9B at London's Kings Cross station and I was delighted to find the platform decked out with Harry Potter references: signs announcing `Hogwarts Express 9 ¾' and warnings such as `All owls must be caged'."

","Yes, everyone and their mother has commented on this story.  So here's my two bits.  ody Americans can't shut up, can they?!]  As you can see in the title, I believed that the film was indeed a noble attempt. <br/><br/>
As a fan with far too much Harry Potter trivia ingrained in my grey matter, and oddly enough, looking like an adult HP, I am the worst possible movie goer for this film: a picky and obsessed fanatic.  My comments on the details:  Harry has GREEN eyes.  I really missed that detail.  And the Dursleys were far too kind.  They were over-the-top in the book, which added to the satirical humor that makes Rowling's books so enjoyable.  I did agree with the cutting of the Norbert scene: it was a small detail touched in later books, but is unimportant in the storytelling.  I wish that there was more interaction with the twins.  I did see them as a bit more muscular, but they were adorable, so I forgave.  And Captain Oliver .. WOOF!  'nuff said. But enough of that.<br/><br/>The story overall was very faithful.  The film lagged only when changes were made.  The Quiddich game was a spectacular treat, BUT it was a bit over the top.  Shades of Home Alone, of course.  But I can forgive that, because it was a spectacular event.  The attacking keys were a bit much for me in the end.. more Home Alone.  Harry was a bit too mean in the beginning.  Part of the joy of the Harry Potter is that it is a coming of age story.  He begins as a quiet, weak little boy, thrust into a world of magic.  And misconceptions are given of the Dursleys.  Duddley-wudkins jumping on the staircase forcing Harry to join them for his birthday?  The hatred between them wasn't as clear as it could have been.  Malfoy was well done, though a distinct sexual desire/tension could be felt.  Interesting.  Emma Watson shines as Hermione Granger.  Though she looks a bit too pretty in my mind. But no one's perfect!<br/><br/>A note on the special effects:  though some say they stunk, I didn't care either way. Some moments could have been cut.  The 30 second moving brick wall could have been cut.  It went on and on.  Just spend five seconds opening the wall.  That's it.  Finis.  The story is so wonderful that there is no need to ""dazzle"" the audience.  Most of the f/x were well done and spent just enough time.  But the aforementioned effect was my only main qualm.  The chess game was brilliant!<br/><br/>But overall, the film was well done.  It focused much time on the ""exciting"" moments, which is fine for a film.  Harry Potter #1 is the weakest book in the series, in my opinion, anyway.  I'm quite curious as to how they'll be able to cut down book four though!  EEK.  Anyway, the film is definitely worth watching.  For HP virgins -- it's worth it as well.  My virginal friends saw it and loved it as well.  :)  Just go when there won't be snivelling little brats to halt your joy."
"a.v. boy","7","0","0","24 November 2001"," Great Book. Good Movie, But Should Have Been Better.
","If you asked me which was my favorite Harry Potter book, I'd have a tough time telling you.  I've read all four to date, and thoroughly enjoyed each one.  What makes the books thoroughly captivating is their combination of the big and the small; quiet self-discovery and rollicking adventure; magic and the ordinary world.  So, what went wrong with this movie? <br/><br/>
It's this:  ALL the ""small"" scenes are missing.  Hermione helping Harry and Ron with their homework.  Harry comforting the poor kid, self-conscious, hand-me-down Ron, with stories about his own extremely impoverished upbringing.  Ron's brothers teasing each other and Ron.  Madam Pince, the librarian, shaking her feather duster in exasperation at Harry.  And hundreds more.  All those ""little"" interchanges that unveil the characters and their world to us in the book and show us their development and growth, and let us bond with them, are just not in the movie.  Okay, arguably, with Alan Rickman as Snape you don't really have to work too hard to show the audience Snape's dark and nasty side.  But, that economy of casting shortchanges the audience.  For example, Snape does some really mean and nasty things to Harry in the book that really challenges Harry's nature and spirit.  But by NOT showing us ANY of that, Chris Columbus leaves us only with pre-made fully-developed characters, and not the living, growing children of Rowling's masterpieces.<br/><br/>So, what IS left?  Sort of a junior ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" set in a magical world.  Nothing to sneeze at, certainly, and a very enjoyable movie, but a complete turnabout of Rowling's focus and emphasis.  Where Rowling depicts ordinary children (or at least magical children with many recognizably ordinary traits) and their ""mundane"" although hilarious lives at this magical wizards school, and secondarily describes their high adventures, Columbus turns the formula around.  In his movie, the adventures are first and foremost, and the rest gets skated over.  Rowling, too, has a true gift for comic exaggeration and counterpoint, which here gets short shrift.<br/><br/>Compare this movie to ""The Witches"", that masterpiece of Nicolas Roeg's from Roald Dahl's classic book, with Angelica Huston as the chief nasty.  Or with Rob Reiner's fractured fairy tale, ""The Princess Bride"".  ""Harry Potter"" should have been a lot more fun, and could have been, if somehow a better balance had been struck.

"larrysmile1","9","0","0","24 November 2001"," HARRY POTTER - A movie for ADULT fantasy not kids...
","This is very good movie! My adult son and I went to see it on Thanksgiving night.  There were no kiddies in the movie, only adults, a sleeping child, and some teenage girls.  <br/><br/>This movie is really a fantasy that adults will enjoy.  First, the cast is all British and Irish.  It is good that American actors were not considered for this film.  Because, we ""Yanks"" would not know how to properly act with that British-aire!  It's a good thing we speak the same language because it would be difficult to follow along in English subtitles!  Wonder how the rest of the world is truly understanding this film with subtitles or voice overs in the local language?<br/><br/>Anyway, you don't have to have read any of the Harry Potter books to enjoy this film.  And, maybe that's a good thing.  I wasn't interested in a fantasy story of some 11 - 12 year old children to have read any of the books.  But, as a movie, it does make for a good story.<br/><br/>I won't bother ""telling"" the story or commenting on some of the tricks of the trade.  My only real criticism is that I had difficulty understanding some of the dialog of the young child actors due to their soft spoken diction and my lack of familiarity with certain spoken phrases and styles of British speech.  Also, as Yanks, many of us don't meet people sporting these uniquely British surnames.  It was only when I saw the cast list on www.IMDB.com that I could understand these characters' last names.<br/><br/>12-year old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), his 11-year old friend-girl Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and his friend-boy Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint - age not listed in IMDB) are people with magical powers. <br/><br/>
They are recruited into the freshman class (6th grade?) at an ""Oxford-style"" University of Wizard Training!  Remember, it is the British lifestyle that this book/film depicts.  Like Oxford, a school composed of a number of distinct colleges, the Wizard U has four different ""houses"" or colleges where the wizards in training are placed according to some inner wizardry ability.  You see this school rivalry by the different colors of scarfs, banners, and neckties the children wear.  <br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, we have a sort of borrowed Cinderella story. Harry Potter, an orphan, is living with his wicked stepparents and wicked cousin until he grows up enough to enter the Hogwart's Wizard School!  One wants to smack mean-wicked Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia Dursley (Fiona Shaw) as well as cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) for their meanness to young Harry Potter.  Young Melling acts like Augustus Gloop the overeater and ""piggy"" from ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.""  He gets his ""in the end.""<br/><br/>Veteran performances by 71 year old Irish actor Richard Harris as the Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (see what I said about ""British"" names?) and 67 year old Dame Maggie Smith as Professor/Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall were a pleasure to view.  This proves that there are good roles for older career seasoned actors/actresses.<br/><br/>55 year old Alan Rickman has great facial expressions and one look from him and you feel you are ""guilty"" of some long lost childhood prank just discovered. Mr. Rickman should have had an expanded role and more speaking lines.  51 year old Robbie Coltrane plays a major role as the Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid.  <br/><br/>One will like the Hogwart's schools traditional sports rivalry in the form of a ""cricket"" style match with young wizards flying full speed on enchanted witches brooms!  One wanted to laugh when Harry Potter receives a ""gift"" of a Nimbus 2000 Model super-flying broom!  Why don't the other kids in this college have one like it?  A bit of a sticky wicket, ay?<br/><br/>There are lots of computer-generated graphic interfaces in this film.  And, it helps to tell the story.  I enjoyed the travel back in time to maybe 18th Century England where Hagrid takes Harry to purchase his special wizard ""school supplies.""  Humm, all the characters here are wizards and Harry begins to learn that he is famous and ""expected.""<br/><br/>Later into the film, we have what is reminiscent of the ""quest"" as in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  What kinds of ""powers"" do ruby-red stones have, anyway?  <br/><br/>I suppose, that in subsequent films, and as Harry and his friendship group grows a little older, we will find them involved in more ""enchanted adventures.""  If the entire cast remains and grows up in this genre, then a little romance between Harry and Hermione is needed.  A little innocent hand holding and a few kisses would help the interaction between these two characters. Remember ""The Wonder Years?"" <br/><br/>So, if you want to finally see a new movie where you won't second-guess the next scenes, then, see Harry Potter.  Forget about reading the books if you have not done so and just enjoy the next six films that may ensue over the next dozen or so years to come.  Maybe this will become a Thanksgiving tradition.<br/><br/>Forget all the talk-hype about anti-religion, witches, black magic, etc. This is a NO HARM fantasy movie.  The ""Devil"" is not going to invade one's household.  Just think about Samantha Stevens from ""Bewitched"" for all those years we watched her on TV and in reruns.  This movie is that innocent. Good triumphs over evil.  Whether you are a wizard or a mortal!<br/><br/>
OK, so I ""told"" a bit of the story.  Anyway, it's a ""9"" and ""Two-Thumbs Up!"""

","I just saw Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone tonight, and I have to give it an applause. I have read the book once, and the film matches up with the book, which is odd because usually the movies are always different from the book. Daniel Radcliffe did an okay performance as Harry Potter, as well as Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. The movie is a great family movie that is highly entertaining.

"ClaudeSchneider","8","0","0","11 November 2001"," As enjoyable as you could expect
","I would suggest to anyone that they should read J.K. Rowling's masterpieces before seeing this film, and the following films too. As is the case for nigh on all films based on novels, the film fights hard to match the book, and rarely succeeds (The Beach, Captain Corelli's Mandolin...) Although, in this case, one could say both the book and the film are the better of the two. Yes, J.K. Rowling wrote the books to be read, and they are incredible in that respect (Harry Potter isn't a world-wide phenomenon for nothing, after all), yet being all about magic and fantastic events, it would be difficult to match her words and our imaginations with on-screen action. Jurassic Park managed its realistic dinosaurs, and myriad other films have used computer graphics to allow the impossible to appear on film, except here they're not quite up to scratch. Blue-screen use is obvious, and even a five year old could tell you what's real and what's fake, and sadly it makes the world of Harry Potter less believable, and that's the root of the magic - the non-muggle world seems so real and is so well depicted in text that we all believe it exists, and can picture it all, yet on film it seems too fake in places. The Quidditch match was indeed very good, as was the half-giant Hagrid, with dear little Norbert....as for the (real) actors, Daniel Radcliffe performed as well as he could, although he is no Haley Joel Osment. Ron and Hermione were better, as was Oliver Wood. Best performances came from Maggie Smith as Prof. McGonagall, and the shifty-looking Snape, who oozed evil just with his darting eyes.<br/><br/>Lastly, I shall mention that fans won't be disappointed too much, as J.K.Rowling had a very firm hand in the making of this film, so much so that she reputedly wept upon seeing the final cut, so happy that her vision had finally become real...<br/><br/>DO go and see it, young muggles and old wizards alike."

","It was truly wonderful! I was so pleased. Everyone keeps saying that they skimmed the book too much, but I disagree. Unless every average movie-goer can sit through a eight hour movie, they cut it down perfectly.<br/><br/>
The biggest complaint was that Hermione's scene at the end with the logic puzzle was cut out, but it had to be. Books have different paces and give diffierent feeling then movies. If that scene had been in there it would have slowed down the action too much to make the final scene between Harry and Voldemort seem important or exciting. All the scenes that were cut were cut for good reason. Either they weren't necessary or they would be explained/delved into further in the other movies, so they could cut them.<br/><br/>The Quidditch match was done beautifully and the actors (especially the kids) were spectacular. The story was not driven by special effects or scenery, and gave a heart-warming feeling at the end. Yet another lovely score by John Williams! The excitement was in all the right places, the sets and costumes really made you feel like you were inside Harry's world. The Dursley's were perfectly selected, and hilarious. All of the teachers and Hagrid fit there roles wonderfully, Harry, Ron and Hermione even more so. It was a fantastic tribute to the books. Well done! The only other things to say is -<br/><br/>Truly Magical!!!"

","I should point out that I had only read about 2/3 of the book when I<br/><br/>saw the film, if that matters.

The characters are true to their literary originals and visually<br/><br/>the film is a real treat.  Hogwarts is very much as I pictured it while<br/><br/>reading the book and the major roles all seem quite well cast.  I<br/><br/>think fans of the novels will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Yes, some of Rowling's more adult humor doesn't make it to the<br/><br/>screen, but since that humor derives primarily from her style of<br/><br/>writing it would be difficult to find a cinematic equivalent.

","Robbie Coltrane and Emma Watson are the best reasons to see this movie. Both are consistently quite good. Daniel Radcliffe gets better as the film progresses and I can see that he could be good as Harry Potter in the sequels.<br/><br/>Key scenes are marred due to poor special effects, esp. the Quidditch sequence, which is esp. sad because other effects are very good (for example, the 3-headed dog and the life-size chess game). The music score is also very disappointing. John Williams recycles music he wrote for both the Star Wars series and Jaws!<br/><br/>I have not read any of the books and suspect that this helped me to like the movie as much as I did.

I came away surprised that it was as good as it was.<br/><br/>The special effects are fantastic, and the story is interesting. I thought I might get a bit bored sitting through a 2-1/2 hour movie, but I was wrong. I was amused by Emma Watson's portrayal of Hermione Granger, all self-important and bossy. I was also impressed with Alan Rickman's performance. I'd seen him in ""Galaxy Quest"" and was hoping to see more of him.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was better than I thought, and is worth seeing.<br/><br/>--- MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD ---<br/><br/>I was most impressed with Alan Rickman's performance as Professor Severus Snape. I figured out the ending to ""The Sixth Sense"" one-third of the way through the movie, so I didn't expect any major surprises from this film.

Good, but not great."
"Orlando-5","9","0","0","11 November 2001"," Not only an excellent piece of entertainment, but also a tremendous and honourable adaptation.
","There's an article at Salon that talks about how little time there is left to remember Harry Potter as he exists in your head - before the big screen version takes over your impressions of Hermione, Ron, Harry and the whole Hogwarts gang. And it's true - it's not exactly how I pictured it, and I'm probably left with the impressions that Chris Columbus has given me.<br/><br/>So thank god that, on the whole, these impressions are positive, entertaining and true to the spirit and plot of the original. You couldn't get a much more faithful adaptation than this. Almost every scene from the book appears to be in the film - which may explain its 2 1/2 hour running time. There's enough time to introduce the wealth of the Wizarding World, from Diagon Alley and Platform 9 3/4s right through to the candlelit banqueting hall and the Dark Forest. And all the characters that need to make an appearance do so - and no matter how incidental their segment, they're given space to shine. And with such a wealth of quality actors, you're unlikely to be disappointed by any of the adults performances.<br/><br/>Our three main leads may be a slightly different matter, but none of them commit intolerable sins. Ron is played perfectly - he's cheeky and fun and shows tremendous comedy skill. Hermione is stroppier than she appears in the books - perhaps too much of a prima donna as well - but she still manages to carry the part effectively without lapsing into parody. Strangely Daniel Radcliffe's Harry is the weakest of the bunch - he has the look and occasionally the passion, but sometimes sounds like he's reading from a script. It has to be said that the scenes in which he sounds forced are generally excruciatingly short - and perhaps don't give him the chance to shine. <br/><br/>This is, in fact, the film's main failing. In attempting to present the whole story, certain bits are played at a rather breath-taking pace. It's a terrible shame that the opening scenes with the Dursley's aren't played at greater length, and much of the expository stuff from Hagrid comes rather too thick and fast. The need to get to the meat of the story overwhelms these earlier scenes a bit - so if you find yourself scratching the back of your head or looking through your popcorn for a really juicy bit, then just bear with it - you will be rewarded when the film settles down... <br/><br/>And a brief note of caution - if you haven't read the books, you are unlikely to be as enthralled as everyone else - the pacing is fairly book-like and you may start wondering where the film's structure is. Hint - you're not watching a standard three-act drama. Settle down, relax, and it will all make sense...<br/><br/>Special effects wise, Harry Potter needs so much spectacle that it's clear that some scenes have been conducted with a little more polish than others. There are only a few parts of the movie that haven't been touched up in some way - whether it be moving staircases, CGI owls or huge 3-headed giant beasts called Fluffy - and the strain shows at times. The Quidditch match for example is tremendous fun (although you wonder that they can get away with such an obviously terrifyingly dangerous sport), but short-cuts have been made which stick out a mile. Look for a particularly embarrassing fall-from-the-sky routine, in which the Quidditch player falls down behind a large piece of cloth. Clearly this saves on the expensive CGI work that a lot of the game requires - which includes (if I'm not mistaken) more than a few completely computer-generated actors...<br/><br/>All in all - you can't go far wrong with this film - it's entertaining, keeps your attention, looks generally pretty good and doesn't lapse TOO often into sentimentality. Kids may not be able to sit still through the first twenty minutes or so, but will settle down after that, and parents should find themselves entertained in a way that may seem strangely familiar from their youth. For all it's flaws (and there aren't really that many), it's a must see movie."
"Greenious","Null","0","0","23 November 2001"," Maybe the ones enjoying it the most have read the books...
","...but that certainly didn't stop my friends from enjoying it.<br/><br/>Sure, I had to explain a few things that doesn't come forward in the movie, but on the other hand, I am not sure how it could have been done and still keep the movie format.<br/><br/>The movie got it's weaknesses, but the biggest weakness is something all movies experience. It is impossible to make a movie true to a book that has so many important characters in it like Harry Potter has. And I think people seeing the movie will be disappointed that many characters in the books got their parts slimmed down to a minimum. Even Harry Potter himself seems almost like a supporting role, in their efforts to let as many characters as possible into the movie.<br/><br/>Despite it's length it only manages to give a person that has never read the books, a small glimpse of the world hiding between the book covers. In a world where TV, movies and multimedia takes up more and more of our time, it somehow feels good that it is that way. Hopefully it will inspire more people to actually read the book, and not only pick up the movie on their way home from school or work.<br/><br/>But, while the characters was slimmed down quite a bit, the set certainly wasn't. Arguably the most enjoyable part of the movie is the set, which is wonderful, and not overdone.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie was without a doubt, the Quidditch game. I've enjoyed descriptions of the games played in the books, but as with all kind of sports, it's best medium is in moving pictures format. I just can't see enough of it, and I can't help but wonder what a movie like ""Mighty Ducks"", the icehockey movie about the underdog kid hockey team, would have been if the game was Quidditch, and not hockey.<br/><br/>In the end though, it is clear that the movie in itself is weak, and wouldn't be a guaranteed success without the books. However, if you look at the movie as a complement to the books, it is awesome, and it  adds to the magic of Harry Potter. Instead of creating an alternative world, as I've seen other book-based movies do, this movie certainly expands the existing one.<br/><br/>This is a great family movie, a perfect getaway from reality for an afternoon or evening. I highly recommend it."

","Before I saw this movie I didn't know any thing about Harry except for all the hoopla on TV. If you have, like many others, then the movie takes on a new meaning as the characters come to life on screen. For me however it was a mediocre story. There was nothing special about Harry, other than the fact that his parent were killed trying to save him. The burning question I tried to answer as I viewed the movie was why Harry? Why him? Why was everyone so enchanted about this boy (in the movie and in the real world)? I don't think the movie answered any of these questions. It was a good story, with good actors and visual effects. It reminded me of my boarding school days with dormitorys, prefects, houses and the eating in a big room with hundreds of other students. The movie didn't enchant me, but I'm not surprised it did many of Potter's fans."

","I've been a grownup Harry Potter fan since the late summer of 1999, when his name was just beginning to be heard frequently around my area and I was wondering who this kid was.  I picked up a paperback copy of the first book at a local shop and spent a couple of hours finding my way around Privet Drive and Hogwarts School.  When I finished the book, I went back to the beginning and started to read it again.  Since that time, I am, in a word, hooked on the Potter phenomenon.<br/><br/> But the movie had me a little worried.  Rarely have books I love been made into movies at all, and when they are I've often found myself disappointed in the results.  I didn't want anyone destroying this literarily perfect universe I have so frequently visited.  I relaxed a bit when I got my first look at Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson -- the kids who would shoulder the massive burden of bringing Harry, Ron, and Hermione to life looked the parts, at least.  Many adult casting elements reassured me as well -- Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and John Hurt, among others.  The movie score by John Williams would no doubt be impressive.  I bought my ticket for opening day.<br/><br/> I don't know what exactly I expected.  What I got was a movie so magical, so  engaging, that I've seen it three times so far and am eager to see it again.  (My husband worries about my sanity sometimes.)  Almost never have I seen a movie that tries so hard to be faithful to the book on which it's based.  It succeeds so well at this, in fact, that the things from the book which don't make it onto the screen are rather conspicuous (to me) by their absence.  I'm eager to see a director's cut of the film, which would be four hours long.  At two hours and 45 minutes, the movie is too short for me.<br/><br/> The casting is something along the lines of ideal.  Robbie Coltrane IS Hagrid, the lovable giant with a fondness for dangerous creatures.  Alan Rickman is sufficiently creepy and sinister as Professor Snape, though I am disappointed that none of Snape's back story is revealed in the movie. Crisp, stern Professor McGonagall is brought most believably to life by Maggie Smith, while John Cleese does a delightful, if brief, turn as Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, the ghost who haunts Harry's dormitory.  John Hurt has a splendid, though again short, appearance as an eccentric wand-maker, and Zoe Wanamaker is wonderfully spirited as flying teacher Madam Hooch.<br/><br/> This movie is for kids, however, and it is the kids who are the stars. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are so adorable that I found myself wanting to reach through the screen and hug the stuffing out of them.  Grint is ideal as Ron, the clownish chess fiend with a heart of gold, and Watson IS Hermione, from her brainy smugness to her fierce loyalty.  Radcliffe, as the courageous but modest orphan with extraordinary abilities, is utterly captivating.  Harry lives, thanks to this talented twelve-year-old.  The chemistry and friendship between the three is undeniable.<br/><br/> I have only three major complaints about the movie. As I said, Snape's back story is not told, secondly not nearly enough Quidditch, and lastly, it's just too short!<br/><br/> Other than that, the main thing I'm worried about is what I'm going to do until the fifth book is released."

","The hype and the merchandising were always going to add to the cynicism with which some people approached the Harry Potter film itself, as was the overly-reverential preciousness with which certain adults treated the book. (It's excusable in children and young teens, but let's grow up, the rest of us!) So if you set all that aside, you're left with two related questions: does the film capture the essential spirit of the book and is it a successful screenplay it its own right?<br/><br/>My opinion: yes and yes. There were countless moments where the delight I had experienced in reading the book (I'm an English Literature teacher who's excited to see some of his younger pupils reading of their own volition for the first time)came back to me with force. At the same time I was hugely impressed by the way in which Steve Kloves' writing had pared down a potentially vast screenplay to the story's essence. (Yes, it's still long, but that's inevitable with the involved nature of Rowling's plotting.) Comments about favourite bits being left out are understandable, but a film is not a visual book - it has to work in its own terms. WHICH THIS DOES - and the non-Potter-reading friend who accompanied me to the movie agreed completely.<br/><br/>Art design/performances/realisation of Quidditch - it's all been said, so I'll just mention my two favourite bits - The Mirror of Erised: very moving, the final confrontation: as unsettling as in the book.<br/><br/>Well done.

","It was an ok movie.  I was disappointed that the emphasis was so heavily on special effects.  I thought that more character development of Snape and McGonagall, and the students and their relationship to each other would have benefited the film a great deal.  Many of the special effects (the killer plant, the boat ride, Gringotts banks, the turning stairways) could have been sacrificed to provide screen time for enjoying the relationships between the students and for establishing the rules and environment of Hogwartz (Ron beats Hermione at chess, Fred and George are a couple of bludgers themselves, Percy is Prefect and proud of it, Ron and Hermione tit for tat, some classes are with Slitherins and some are with other houses and some are just Gryffindor, the names of their different classes, Snape protected Harry because Harry's Dad saved Snape's life) to the overall improvement of the film.<br/><br/>In addition the character development scenes they did have didn't have enough reaction shots.  Reaction shots tell the audience what everyone on the screen is thinking about events and each other.  There weren't enough reaction shots to Hermione's academic show offs or to Snape's speech the first day of Potions class, or to Harry being chosen for Gryffindor, or to Professor McGonagall's putting Harry on the quiditch team.  It leaves the scenes feeling flat and takes away from the psychological suspense of a scene.<br/><br/>I hope Chris Columbus chooses to shoot more reaction shots in the next one. They add to the cost but they add so much more to the feel of the movie. And I hope that whoever edits the next one decides to use the footage of the outstanding performances of the cast that lend substance and true pleasure and attachment to a film over the flashier thrill rides if they are faced with a such a choice again.  I'm looking forward to the next one being a five star classic."

I can say I enjoyed the movie greatly, but it is<br/><br/>just not the wonderful experience that reading it is.  The movie has<br/><br/>limits where imagination does not.  In the novel there were so<br/><br/>many little lines that you don't notice when reading through, but<br/><br/>while watching you miss.  The little petty interactions that had to be<br/><br/>cut for the movie take away from the character development that<br/><br/>makes the books seem so real.  For the most part the casting was<br/><br/>done amazingly well compared to how I saw the characters in my<br/><br/>mind's eye.  The three main characters were played exceptionally<br/><br/>well and that was enough to keep the experience alive.  Another<br/><br/>problem I saw from how friends of mine who hadn't read the book<br/><br/>reacted to it is that too much was cut out and not accounted for. <br/><br/>Many events just roll into each other and leave the viewer baffled<br/><br/>as to how it got that way.  Either way, I'm happy I saw it in the<br/><br/>theater but I won't be tempted to see it again until it comes out on<br/><br/>DVD."

","1st watched 11/20/2001 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Chris Columbus): Inventive fantasy film that appeals to young school-age kids in many different ways.  As I watched this movie in the theatre, surrounded by middle school kids, I understood  why they are captivated by this character, Harry Potter.  Not having read any of the books, but only having brief information fed to me by  my 9-year old I was unprepared for what this movie was really about.  I believe this character appeals to kids because #1 - he's from a broken home (like many young kids today), #2 - he's fighting against the evils of the world everyday(like many kids are at this age - trying to figure out what's right and wrong), #3 - it's fun (there was a tremendous game played at Hogwart's where the characters are flying on broomsticks where the pace is very fast like many video games that kids play today), #4 - the class mentality displayed at Hogwart's(similar to school rivalry's just blossoming with kids these days), and finally #5 - Harry wins and wins by playing by the rules(most of the time).  This is even fun  to watch for old-timers like myself (even though I had to get tips from my 9-year old every once in a while about what was happening on-screen, which she gave me unsolicited every couple minutes).  All in all this movie is basically a good time had for all.  Not taken seriously it is very appealing to people of all ages."

","If you've ever indulged in the fantastical worlds of The Neverending Story or the like, and you just love those hero/journey tales, you'll fall in love with Harry Potter: The Philosopher's Stone.<br/><br/>Coming from a standpoint of never having read the books, I thoroughly enjoyed the magic of the movie. Though I can see that having read the books beforehand can be an advantage, it isn't necessary to fully grasp all of the elements that make this movie wonderful. The animation is charming and its fairy-tale quality makes it delightful from start to finish. The colours and music are fantastical. <br/><br/>If you like goblins, sorcerers and wizardry, you won't be able to tear your eyes away from the screen. If you aren't into any of the above, I think you oughta give this one a try. You will come out a convert.<br/><br/>This will be one for the video/DVD library."

","The most eagerly-awaited book-to-film translation arrives with a thunderous roar but eventually takes a few bad turns and winds up just another bombastic marketing escapade. Buy a Sorceror's Happy Meal and get your very own magic wand free. The film cost $125 million to make and a third more ($40M) to market.<br/><br/>At the start, it seems as though Chris Columbus has melded ""Mary Poppins"" with ""Willy Wonka"" fairly well, with Harry's nagging foster parents, a loutish blowhard bully of a foster-brother, a cool giant of a man (Robbie Coltrane, who pretty much steals this show), a cool scene in Victorian England's ""Diagon Alley"" (get it?) where Harry buys his sorcery supplies, fun cameos (by John Hurt, John Cleese and others), brooding would-be villain Alan Rickman, priggish professor Maggie Smith, wisened Headmaster Richard Harris, etc.<br/><br/>The sets are superb, the special effects for the most part, excellent, although the CGI-splattered Quidditch game is over-the-top ~ reminding one of Lucas' pod-race in ""The Phantom Menace"" and paling in comparison ~ and some of the stop-action stuff simply looks dumb.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe is just about perfect as Potter, although his character frequently is left with nothing to do but react to others -- a fatal flaw for a film's hero. The part of his amusing worst-luck wizard pal ""Ron"" is very well-acted by newcomer Rupert Grint. But Emma Watson's ""Hermione"" is far too often played as a know-it-all: her overall performance looks a lot like that of a child actor... acting.<br/><br/>And unfortunately, John Williams couldn't resist composing the score and boy is it loud. And unmemorable. Stick to Spielberg & Lucas, Johnny-boy. And speaking of Spielberg, this was supposed to be his film initially; when he dropped out to make the terrible ""A.I. - Artificial Intelligence,"" somehow it fell into Columbus' hands (and wallet). Yep, the clown who most recently brought you ""Stepmom,"" ""Bicentennial Man"" and ""Nine Months"" is now the owner of the biggest opening ever. Yikes.<br/><br/>Me: At two hours and thirty-two minutes, this is awfully long for a kiddie fantasy but the first two-thirds of the film work. The ending, while unpredictable, feels lame. See you at McDonald's - I'll be the one with the Happy Meal. FiancÃ©e: Enjoyed one hundred forty-five of the one hundred fifty-two minutes of it (she disliked the troll segment)."

","Ho Hum. ""Star Wars with Magic"" <br/><br/>This review Spoiler Free. Accept no substitutes.<br/><br/>I'm one of the six people on the planet who didn't read ""Stone"" 84 times before the movie was released. Nor did I highly anticipate it. So, I'm just talking about another movie here and I'm not comparing it to the book.<br/><br/>Ho Hum.<br/><br/>""HP"" is in fact, nothing especially new and when it gets to the final scenes, it was so much like Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back that I was, as the Brits might say, ""rather astonished!""<br/><br/>The show has so much exposition and set up I wondered when we might get to the story.  Some of the little journeys taken on the way were interesting in an OK sort of way. Harry getting even with his step-brother. Harry search for platform 9 3/4. The Hundred Acre Wood version of a boarding school. How very charming. (All-in-all, very well acted too. The Brits know how to do that!) I did wonder about the Christmas celebration - afterall, ""witchcraft"" is/was a very much anti-Christian thing to do! Oh, bother.<br/><br/>But, it just never seemed to really ""take off."" Now, I suppose that there won't be a seven year old who doesn't want his own cloak of invisibility for Christmas and I might be a little hard on this film in that respect - but, geesh, it's bloody Star Wars. In the last scene, the bad guy says ""join me"" and HP says ""Never!"" Puhleeze! And a dolip of whipped cream on top in the epilogue to explain the ever so conveinent powers Harry ""discovers"" in the nick of time. The Hardy Boys meet Luke Skywalker meets ""Willow.""<br/><br/>
Good performances from Richard Harris and Alan Rickman, both of whom are somewhat wasted in the film. Very nice SPFX all about, courtesy Lucasfilm.<br/><br/>I know, I know! Now, I'll go read the book."

"doug_funnie","9","0","0","22 November 2001"," A fantastic book to movie transfer!
","I was so excited to hear about the Harry Potter movie and I couldn't wait to see it. When I did, I was very, very satisfied with the results. The movie sticks to the book so well (without minor scenes), and every image is so satisfying and enjoyable to watch. The characters practically jump out of the book and the roles of Harry, Ron and Hermione are very well acted (not to mention Snape, Dumbledore, McGonagall and the Dursleys). All of the imagery is so believable, it looks like they didn't use computer graphics at all! These scenes include the Quidditch game and the large chess match, and those are only two of the unbelievable scenes. The entire two hours and 30 minutes is so tremendously worth it for all fans of the Harry Potter books, however the movie is not an excuse for not reading the book. The movie is amazing and realistic, but it lacks the sense of reading the book."
"Allan-14","8","0","0","22 November 2001"," Brooms Up
","Going into ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I did not share the current hype surrounding it. Two reasons: one, I did not read the book, and two, I was a little concerned about the man in charge of bringing the bestseller to the screen. Granted, director Chris Columbus knows how to work with kids, as evidenced in his megapopular ""Home Alone"", ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" I've enjoyed most of his work, even ""Bicentennial Man,"" which many did not. Of course, I hated ""Home Alone 2,"" as I felt it covered familiar territory in rather uninteresting ways. And even though I found his other films to be entertaining at least on a basic level, I also recognized how superficial his work is. Columbus lays on the sap and sentiments in ways that Hollywood loves and film historians loathe (see ""Stepmom"").<br/><br/>Now he's brought ""Harry Potter"" to the screen. I enjoyed it. And a bit more than his other works. Does this mean Columbus magically transformed into a different director, overnight, a la Spielberg's shift from ""Jurassic Park"" to ""Schindler's List?"" Not really. Thankfully however he also didn't play an act, like say, Michael Bay did with ""Pearl Harbor"" (Bay: ""Oooh look at me I'm making a serious film now... maybe this film has even more sentiment than ever before, but look at those explosions! Feel the power of my godlike filmmaking!""). It seems Columbus knew where his true abilities lie, and with ""Harry Potter,"" he's managed to stray away from forcing emotions. In fact if anything there's not enough emotional punch going for ""Potter,"" which is far better than what I was expecting.<br/><br/>Having not read the book, I came into this over-hyped picture having little idea what I would see, and perhaps give a more unbiased approach. As a film, the atmosphere is entrancing. It's dark, it's fun, and oh boy is it long. I don't share the sentiment of many of my friends that ""Potter"" races by. A good half hour could have been cut and I wouldn't have really known the difference. I got by through ""Titanic"" and ""Gladiator"" without growing antsy. A film should be as long as the filmmaker needs it to tell the story (Terrence Malick should take a hint) and that is all.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty decent; young Radcliffe makes his presence known as the young Potter. We can expect ""great things"" from him in the future. If I have any one big quarrel with the script, and I apologize to ye loyal Potter fans out there, it is that he doesn't have enough lines. I felt his friends had a tad too much to say. The film finally finds its real power when Harry is on his own, such as the scene with the mirror, or the finale.<br/><br/>
The effects are suitable, not terrific, for the picture. I didn't find the CG matte paintings fancy enough for any Oscar nods, but it works. The production design is (as expected) terrific, and the cinematography is just involving enough to... keep you involved. The upcoming ""Fellowship of the Ring"" has much more of a fantasy-feel to it, which is fitting, and I'm glad that Columbus and co. did not go to great lengths to remove this film from reality.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Harry Potter"" is an entertaining film. It doesn't have a hold on me like many others, but I can see how it may be remembered by contemporary audiences as this generation's ""Wizard of Oz."" When ""Titanic"" came out, it was hailed as our generation's ""Gone With the Wind,"" and I agreed (much to the harsh disagreements of most people I know; ironic that it's much ""cooler"" now to hate ""Titanic"" than like it). I guess we'll see in the next twenty years. By then, all seven books will have been filmed, Mr. Radcliffe will be starring opposite Anna Paquin in ""The Piano Returns,"" and we will see if the hype is carrying ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" back to the big screen. 8/10."
"conradb","7","0","0","11 November 2001"," Well made, but lightweight
","I hate being just about the only dissenting voice, but I was not overly impressed with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (as it is titled in the UK).<br/><br/>I have not read the books at all, so I did not have any preconceptions about what should be in there from the book, and I didn't have any idea of the plot.<br/><br/>Firstly, I found the movie overly long - I don't have any problem with long movies per se - as long as something is happening. There seemed to be far too much exposition, and it was over halfway into the film before a plot started to develop - and even that was quite slight. Perhaps this is because J.K Rowling was loath to lose too much from the book, perhaps they've already got the next 6 movies in mind.<br/><br/>The adult actors are very good - Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane - are all excellent. Unfortunately the child actors are quite one dimensional, especially in their failure to show any meaningful emotion.<br/><br/>The effects aren't brilliant, but they're generally good enough. The sets and locations are superb.<br/><br/>Overall I found it a well made but light confection - enjoyable enough, but easily forgotten."

","I loved this film. I taped the story being read by Stephen Fry on BBC Radio (Boxing Day 2000) and have listened to it many times - usually when I'm going to sleep. So, (as I sleep quickly and soundly) there is lots of it I have not heard. The bits that I did hear gripped my attention so thoroughly and enjoyably that I was really looking forward very much to see the film. I LOVED every moment of it and found that the pictures that I had visulaised in my head were so much in line with  how they were portrayed in the film - it was almost like a rubber stamp. It is not a superficial liking but a very deep (to the toes of my boots) feeling  which has made me think that something very deep was being portrayed in the film/story.  I also heard JK Rowlings being interviewed - again on the BBC Radio - Desert Island Discs; her choice of music also resonated with me. So, I think this may not be merely  a single personal response but quite possibly be a wider and more general(and really quite precious) one."

","I think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (or Philosopher's Stone, depending on where you live) will be a classic. It not only stays true to the book, but the casting is wonderful. Every actor in the movie is perfect for their character. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter is brilliant. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley are excellent. The visual effects are ""state of the art technology"". Believe me, sitting in a dark theater for two and a half hours are absolutely worth every second."
"hannise","10","0","0","21 November 2001"," Everything I expected
","WARNING! Some Spoiler Content.<br/><br/>As an avid reader of the books I've been anticipating the release of the movie for months with mixed feelings. A part of me has been eager to see how the magical world of moving pictures, quiditch and magical lessons would appear visually on a movie screen, another part of me has been reluctant to relinquish my own imagination to the imagination of the directors and producers of the film.<br/><br/>Regardless I went to see the show opening night. I went in knowing that the movie would not be as good as the book, movie adaptations never are. But I also knew that the producers had attempted to keep the integrity of the story and characters in tact. I was not disappointed by what I saw. The casting director deserves an award for being bang on for every character. The Dursleys were almost as I had pictured them, though I was disappointed they weren't portrayed as mean as they are in the books, though I understand that time was an issue, and it really didn't take away from the story.<br/><br/>
But it was the children, especially Ron, and Hermione that really stole the show, Emma Watson was perfect as the supersmart, bossy Hermione, they couldn't have chosen a better actress for the role. And Rupert Grint was beyond adorable as Ron. The adult roles too were perfect, especially Snape, McGonagal, and Dubledore.<br/><br/>As for the story, with the exception of 2 scenes I thought it was done beautifully. Combined with just the right amount of special effects, it seemed that this world of wonder and magic could really exist. The Quiditch match was by far the highlight of the movie for me, and though I have heard some people say that it seemed unimportant to the story, I believe it was in fact essential. In the story of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, Harry is discovering this world of magic for the first time, Quiditch is a part of this world and is therefore essential to his feeling of wonderment, and eventually belonging. All his life he's never belonged anywhere and suddenly he's an essential player in the biggest game of the Wizarding world... not to mention the fact that he becomes a hero... not for something that happened when he was a baby and doesn't remember but for something he has done here and now. This is essential to understanding the character of Harry, not to mention it looked amazing!<br/><br/>My biggest complaint about the movie is that the dragon thing was changed too much, they should have either expanded it a little more, or left it out completely because as it was it really didn't flow with the rest of the movie. My only other complaint is the omission near the end of the movie, where the kids are going through the obstacles to get to the stone. After the chess game there is supposed to be a potions riddle that Hermione helps Harry solve before he goes on by himself to encounter the last challenge. The fact that this was omitted makes very little sense to me, as it is mentioned earlier that ""Snape is one of the teachers protecting the stone"" yet his protection does not exist.<br/><br/>Other than this I found the movie overall very enjoyable and I eagerly await the 5th book and the next movies. Though it baffles me to think how they will adapt the 4th book without butchering it or turning it into an 8 hour epic!!! I definitely recommend this movie, but I still think to truly appreciate this movie, you need to read the books.<br/><br/>10/10"

","(first part spoiler free)<br/><br/>Having read (and loved) the entire series so far, overall I was very pleased with the first movie result.  For the first two thirds of the movie, I found myself grinning like a madman.  My only complaint was that some of the visual effects were lacking, primarily when they attempted to render human actions and movements totally in CG.  They did a good job, in the first 2/3 of the movie, of capturing the majority of the book, although non-readers will likely be confused with some of the story elements.  At the 2/3 mark, however, it seems as though they just plain *ran out of time* and started compressing bigger chunks of the story into neatly tied-up packages.  This was a bit disturbing, as well a good chunk that was removed from the end of the story. The climax in general feels oddly placed, as well. These elements detracted somewhat from the movie, but not enough for me to dislike it. It is still wonderfully done and really captures the essence of the book.  I am more concerned with how that future movies will turn out, as their stories are more complex and conform less to removal of plot elements.<br/><br/>(spoilers below)<br/><br/>My primary complaints are the lack of Norbert as a running story (he's quickly dealt with in literally 5 minutes)and the deletion of the final potions room in the end.  I realize that things must have been removed, but by this point in the movie, it just felt rushed. Quiddich is generally well done, but much of it is CG and looks flat out cartoony at times."

Some people may come away ( if they haven't read the books) dissapointed that the film meanders without a real plot, but those who've read the Philosiphers stone will know that this is the character film, it introduces you to the people.

"njb1000","10","0","0","11 November 2001"," Very Succesful attempt, Filled with Magical wonder
","I should start by saying I am an absolute Harry Potter nut and so the film carried a huge weight of expectation.  It didn't disappoint.  The film includes stunning renderings of all the key scenes, wonderfully acted by an obviously caring and dedicated team.  The scenery and effects are stunning and fill you with a sense of wonder I haven't felt since I was a kid. Diagon alley, platform 9 3/4 and Hogwarts are all straight from J.K. Rowlings descriptions and were just how I pictured them.  The set pieces of the quiditch and chess match were fantastically exciting and added pace to a film that could have lagged (its 2 1/2 hours!).  The acting was uniformly superb.  Maggie Smith is brilliant as the strict yet caring McGonagal, Richard Harris adds the perfect sense of weght to Dumbledore and Snape is made suitably menacing without being camp by Alan Rickman.  The kids are brilliant, Rupert Grin and Emma Watson making Ron and Hermione their own, with only one line sounding corny from either.  Dan Radcliffe is good as Harry but would I feel have benefited from a bit of voice to camera naration to explain his feelings.  A mention should also go to Sean Biggerstaff as Oliver Wood, who is great when guiding Harry through quiditch and performing heroics in the Gryfindor goal.  Undoubtedly the star of the show though is Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid, he shows a full range of emotion from rage at the dursleys to caring ad sensitive with Harry.  He also gets the best comedic momments throughout the film.<br/><br/>The film cuts out some of the ancillary bits from the book, the begging is truncated and some scenes which added context or insight are missing, but if you left them in it would have to be a mini series instead of a film. Nothing important is missed however and the film still conveys the magical wonder of the book.<br/><br/>I loved this film, it had me cheering at the quiditch and crying at the end with the poignant momnts of interaction between characters.  The film is truly magical!"

","I think that I was more excited about this movie coming out than my kids. I was in such a state that I went to a 9:15 am showing.  I am sad to say that it was not as spectacular has I had hoped.  I felt that it should have been much more colorful, with more special effects. I understand that they had to pick and choose scenes for the movie, but there were some crucial things that should have been added.  I did not like that Hogwarts was so forboding, or that the train was not made more eye catching.  My son and I actually dozed off at some parts.  The movie was okay for people who had not read the books, but I think that many readers will not be has happy with it. It really left me feeling as though the story was only half told.  I wanted to see more magic, more character relationships.  I know that we have no desire to see it again."

I thought he was supposed to taunt the 'little firsties'!?!?!?!<br/><br/>The effects were amazing, though my favourite has to be the low-key sorting hat - that was so well done!!<br/><br/>I found it hard to watch the film without letting my mind wonder - mostly to the book, but also one of the locations!! Number 4 Privet Drive - filmed in Martins Heron, Bracknell, near where i live!!<br/><br/>To me, the plot didnt make as much sense as the book did - yes i know they had to miss out loads of it otherwise it would have been over 3hrs at a guess, but the bit with the post trying to be delivered to Harry should have been a bit longer - whatever happened to the perplexed postman handing the post through the the living room window!?!?<br/><br/>The cast was really well chosen - Richard Harris though didn't really fit my interpretation of Albus Dumbledore - he did act well, but to me the character in the book was more comical and not as serious as Harris was. Severus Snape, Alan Rickman, wasnt as scary as i thought he would be, i think he could have been a bit more evil!! but maybe that would have scared some people!! Minerva MacGonagall, Maggie Smith, was brilliant - exactly as I saw her and the effects of her transfiguring between a gorgeous tabby cat and herself were really good, breathtakingly good!! Harry, Ron and Hermione were brilliant - really good, though i thought Daniel Radcliffe's voice was a bit emotionless, but otherwise excellent. The ghosts were a bit odd - Peeves was not to be seen, the Bloody Baron was comical not scary, but nearly headless Nick was really well done by John Cleese.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the film - it was really good entertainment and I'm glad that I saw it, but any film that is based on a book will never be as good as the book that it is based on. Chris Colombus - congratulations - you have produced a film that in its opening weekend grossed Â£80 million - the highest ever, and i know why, and so do so many other people"
"cooncat1","10","0","0","21 November 2001"," In a word ... ""Brilliant""
","I thoroughly enjoyed the movie adaptation of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Philosopher's Stone).  Perhaps the most telling proof I can offer is that I've never gone back to the theater to see a movie for a 2nd time .. until Harry Potter. I've seen it twice now, and may go back to see it again, just to ""experience the magic"".<br/><br/>""Brilliant"" describes the performances by the main cast, the settings, the score and the effects.<br/><br/>Though the movie is perhaps best described as a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the book (Harry Potter Lite?), it is completely understandable. To have included the book in its entirety would have produced an 8 hour movie. The movie captures the essence of the book, however, and is thoroughly enjoyable as it is.  I can only recommend to those that have seen the movie, but have not read the book, to go out and get the book and read it NOW!<br/><br/>From the opening notes of ""Hedwig's Theme"", the hair on my arm stood up. I (and many of my fellow movie-goers) openly laughed, gasped, and, yes, even sniffled a bit at various parts of the movie. To invoke such emotion from so many in an audience comprised of every age level is ... magic.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus .. thanks for a great film.

","Having not read the books, nor have I really followed the ""Harry Potter"" universe (other then what I have heard others talk about it), I went to see the movie for entertainment.  From that viewpoint the movie was okay (yes I was entertained).  The best way to describe the  movie/story is that it is a child's fantasy.  From what I do understand of the ""Harry Potter"" universe, the movie fits well, and I would say that if you are a fan of Harry Potter, you will be happy with the movie.<br/><br/>As for the story itself, I found it to be simplistic and some rehashing of older stories.  Maybe this is more of a commentary about the state of current literature for children then anything else (I am not trying to put down the Harry Potter books -- they have gotten kids reading -- which is goodness).  But let the Harry Potter books open up the doors to other worlds.  Some suggestions,<br/><br/>C. S. Lewis ""Chronicles of Narnia"" Ursula K.

A movie that transports you to places you can only imagine, with a story that isn't written ""down""to children or ""up"" to intellectuals is rare indeed.  Just a fun ride for all.  If you leave a theater with joy and wonder in your heart, what else could you ask for?  Sorcerer's Stone is a fairy tale in it's best form.  Take it for what it is and don't try to read any implications into the story, just relax and enjoy.

","I am a movie nut.  I see a lot of stuff.  One thing I don't do though is read often.  I use to when I was younger, but I find that at my age works of the printed word rarely raise my interest.  Then one day, someone gave me a Potter book, and I was hooked instantly on the characters and the imagination of JK Rowling's world.  I have read all 4.<br/><br/>With that being said I was very anxious, and VERY concerned to see the first adaptation of Rowling's first novel.  I wondered if they would trash it's world, commercialise it, trivialise it, or worse somehow Americanize it in an attempt to appeal to US audiences. Luckily none of these things have happened there is no sacharine just pure sweet joy.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus has done a marvelous job in directing this film.  First off, the movie just looks amazing.  The 'other world' beyond the muggles is so richly detailed, every corner alley, every costumed character, every piece of wooden furniture, the shining red train of platform 9 and 3/4's, even the etching of chiseled emblems, team scarves its all there in abundance.<br/><br/>Then you have the young actors.  Radcliffe as the perfect Potter, Emma Watson in her bookish teacher pet charm as Hermione,  Tom Felton as the slick haired Draco Malfoy Potter's nemesis, and the best Rupert Grint as Ron Weasly Potter's sidekick and best chum who gets all the best lines and steals the show with his facial expressions alone.<br/><br/>Even at 2 1/2 hours long I didn't want this film to end.  Sure things have been kept out from the book which is far richer, but if they included everything I am sure the film would have went on for 4 hours straight.  What is important is that key scenes were kept that added to the plot of future films for those uninitiated with the story.  Also those scenes that are included are just enjoyable, the Quidditch MATCH!!!, Potter in the wand shop, the escaping snake, Fluffy the dog, the flying keys... its all as I had imagined it.<br/><br/>Then you have a cast of minor players which I wish could have more screen time,  Father Dursley's bumbling, Hagrid's stern but dumbness persona, and then the best Alan Rickman as the devious professor Snape, who draws out his lines with such skill it makes your skin crawl.<br/><br/>No the movie is not perfect it couldn't have everything, and I do think that those who have not read the book would be somewhat confused by its story as well.  But all in all this movie is perfect for fans, adults, kids, and that small 1% of people who have yet to be initiated in the world of Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Bring on book 5 and Chamber of Secrets to film I can't wait.<br/><br/>Rating 8 out of 10"
"jon.h.ochiai","9","0","0","21 November 2001"," True Magic
","""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a wonderful movie. This comes from a Harry Potter illiterate. The story and movie are very reminiscent of the Star Wars mythology. Orphan Harry has special gifts-- an undeveloped and natural power. He like Luke Skywalker is the chosen One. So he must be trained. In Harry's case this takes place at the Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is to become a great wizard, like Luke becomes a powerful Jedi. Along the way, we learn that there is a very powerful and seductive ""dark side"" to Magic. Ultimately the path is a choice or perhaps a sacrifice. Harry feels alone and incomplete-- he yearns for his dead parents. The whole scene with Harry sitting in front of the Mirror of Erised and speaking with Richard Harris as Dumbledore (Hogswart Headmaster) made it for me. Dumbledore says that men have gone mad looking into the Mirror living their dreams, ""...forgetting to live."" Great stuff. Looks like the other books may be darker as Harry seeks out the man responsible for murdering his parents. Also the message that true magic does not come from books, rather from friendship, bravery, and ultimately love is touching. The movie is a magical journey of a hero, Harry. <br/><br/>The movie is stunning visually. The John William's music and sound set the right atmosphere. I gather that director Chris Columbus steered by the R.K. Rowling's book (from the Steven Kloves screenplay). To his credit he generates strong performances from his actors. Daniel Radcliffe (who looks like John Lennon as a boy) is perfect as Harry-- the lonely and courageous boy coming into his own, and finding and creating a family. Emma Watson as know-it-all, Hermione, all but steals the movie. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley is charming and funny. Robbie Coltrane is great as the protector Hagrid. Alan Rickman is at his slippery evil best as Prof. Snape. An unusually restrained Richard Harris is excellent as the Headmaster Dumbledore, the powerful, wise, and whacky mentor. Maggie Smith as Headmistress McGonagall is great as the strict and compassionate professor. As one of my friends says-- ""Maggie Smith rocks!"" <br/><br/>""Harry Potter"" is total entertainment. I will read the book."

"kaylenns","7","0","0","21 November 2001"," Surprised by the darkness
","When I read the first book, I found myself disturbed by it; beneath the surface humor and the compelling fantasy world, there was a darker edge. I found myself unable to read more. I went to see the movie, expecting to find the dark edge gone, reduced to light and enjoyable kids' fare; I wanted to discover that the edge was only in my own mind. Instead, I was surprised to see these kids bleeding and being hacked at by magicked stones with swords. The dark edge I had felt in the books was magnified on the screen, not diminished. The flying keys being rammed into the closed door was a shock for me--these little kids are messing about with rampant and powerful evil. The defenses around the stone were meant to be strong, and they were supposedly cast by ""good"" people, but they were intended very seriously to kill indiscriminately--how ""good"" is that? I felt that the explanation of Harry's survival as having ""skin covered with love"" fell a bit flat for me, and the physical abuse in the opening sequence was accompanied by Exorcist-type supernatural disturbances (I found myself almost feeling bad for the Dursleys, being attacked by all that mail! Almost--but not quite.) Perhaps if this film was aimed at the 16-26 demographic and was billed as a film with a dark edge to it, I would not have been surprised by the presence of darkness. However, as a children's movie, I found it seriously lacking."

","Ahh, so THIS is what everyone was talking about, this Harry Potter chap and his movie. I'll keep it short and sweet since I went to the 9:45 showing and came out at 12:30, thus am sleepy and still recovering.<br/><br/> Daniel Radcliffe may be the nominal star of the movie, and a very appealing and talented kid he is, but make no mistake, the real stars of Harry Potter are the production design and the special effects. Therein lies the problem: the effects and design are so magnificently, elaborately overwhelming and omnipresent that they almost shove the story and characters off the screen (which I haven't read in original novel form, although I probably should). They pop and slither all over the screen, saying ""look at me!"" Now, the sets and design are fabulous--someone deserves an Academy award for creating such an awesomely detailed (to quote Kael) fantasy world. But the CGI effects, which took a dozen or more studios and probably 80% of the end credits, are the standard Hollywood-type eye candy IMO. Often clever, but too damn much of it, and usually pretty fake looking. In fantasy, I prefer *not* seeing all the snazzy and expensive effects stuck right in my face, one after the other, as if they don't trust me to get the hint on my own. But this IS a big budget movie we're talking about here...gotta spend that money somehow. Thank Goodness they didn't add dumb sound effects a'la Disney.<br/><br/> There IS a story in here, though, and people. Everyone does as well as they can with their roles...Dan Radcliffe is definitely a spot-on lookalike of the illustrated Harry Potter on millions of book covers worldwide, and the kid can act pretty well too, although we get way too many reaction shots of him looking awestruck and flashing that Mary Lou Retton grin of his :-D. Rupert Grint is probably the bigger discovery, though; he's got a ton of appeal and great comic timing, looking and acting like a very young John Lennon. Emma Watson is an incredibly adorable, pretty girl who will no doubt have a bright future in movies ahead of her if she can learn to stop bobbing her head with each word. Tom Felton puts in a delightfully sneery turn as a preadolescent cross between Alex Winter and Rutger Hauer. As for the adult actors, they're great thespians in the British stage tradition, but I mistook a lot of them for other actors: Alan Rickman fooled me into thinking he was a magically de-aged David Warner, and I thought I saw Madge Ryan as the broom-riding coach. As for Johns Hurt and Cleese and Richard Harris, I missed them totally! Wow. The big bearded fellow and those absurdly nasty Potter relatives are also memorable.<br/><br/> Ah, but the story...intriguing. Entertaining. Occasionally exciting. But took SO long to get going. I realize that you have to establish this whole other world and all, but could we condense it a bit? Too many sidetracks into things (read the Quiggleball-or-whatever-it-was-called match) that looked cool but didn't advance the story at all. A bit sluggish in spots.<br/><br/> Final word: a very entertaining 2 1/2 hours, and a good advertisement for the Harry Potter books and for the effects studios. Not deep, not thought provoking, certainly not a masterpiece, but fun, pretty to look at, and a hell of a lot better overall than Disney's junk. And no product placements either!"

"kerridv","Null","0","0","20 November 2001"," No surprises
","Say what you will about the hype the fact stands that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was indeed, a fabulous book. Insightful writing, dry wit, spine-tingling action, heart-tugging emotion, and fantasy action fill the story; naturally the anticipation for the movie matched the reader's love for J.K. Rowling's masterpiece about a boy who attends wizardry school.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the biggest complaints about movies made from books is that they don't follow the book. The pressure to keep Harry Potter true to form was immense: here is a story every kid and adult not only has read over and over but knows every minutae by heart. There would be no foolin' those kids this time around. Any detail left out, any stone left unturned, would be noticed and bemoaned. This is a big factor as to why the movie clocked in at 152 minutes. (What are they going to do when book four rolls around? There will have to be an intermission to pick up one's senses from the theatre floor.) So it was director Christopher Columbus' big challenge to stay true to form, capture the essence of the Harry Potter story, and not alienate every crazed and charmed fan out there. While he succeeded at all of these things, did he make a good movie?<br/><br/><br/><br/>It's hard to say. The movie is certainly entertaining, sticks to the book like glue, and is a work of art and special effects. But does it capture the magic of J.K. Rowling's superb storytelling is a good question. Oddly it doesn't. It almost sticks to the book too much. If you have read the book more than once and oozed in the characters and plot line like I have, there's nothing in this film that surprises you. And that, unfortunately, is the element missing from making this a masterpiece of a film. You know what is coming around the corner. You know what Hermione is going to say before she says it. You know that Professor Quirrel is up to something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
However, the all-star cast is wonderful, and the special effects are perfect-they don't overshadow the film and yet add just the right touch to spark your imagination. I was not particularly impressed with any of the three children's performances but they portray the characters just fine. Everyone portrayed the characters a little too well. They seemed like cardboard, in a way-the exception being a surprise cameo by John Cleese.<br/><br/><br/><br/>My recommendation is to certainly go see it, especially if you have read the books. It's fun just to bring a well-loved book to life, even if there are no sparks to the movie version. There may be some scary bits for young children, but hey, afterall the book is supposed to be for those age nine and over anyway. If you are one of the two people out there who have not read the books, you may just find it more entertaining."

The quittage match everyone is raving about was utterly pointless.  It in no way developed the storyline.  Actually, nothing developed the story until about two hours into the film.  What's with the quittage match anyhow?  Why do you get points for something that automatically makes you win the game?? Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman at least give something to watch.  They both delivered great performances.  Too bad they didn't have much to work with.  Had this movie been cut to about an hour and a half it might have been tolerable.  But as it is, there is too much wandering around for no apparent reason.  How children can sit through this is beyond me.  For fantasy movies, give me Lord of the Rings.

So I went with an open mind.<br/><br/>Several of my friends remarked that the beginning was too rushed and not much was explained.  That they never got a sense of how desperate living with the Dursleys was to Harry.  How Harry got bullied by Dudley and his gang and how Harry used his powers to get out of those tight situations.<br/><br/>
But being 153 minutes long, if those and other passages from the book were included, the film would be 3+ hours!<br/><br/>I found the movie wonderfully captured the magical aspects of the book. The adult actors, though were not fleshed out, were enjoyable.  I also suspect that even though actors Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and John Cleese (who was seen for a total of 30 seconds!) were not on screen for that long, their characters will have time in the next 6 movies to develop.<br/><br/>Remember, there are still 6 movies that are still due.  We'll be getting to know these characters more and more over the course of these films.  Would be pretty interesting to see the child actors grow to young adults on screen!<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliff played a wonderfully serious and subdued Harry, exactly as I envisioned Harry to be.  Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were excellent as well.  Hard to believe they never acted professionally before this.<br/><br/>

Obviously changes had to be made to the story or we could have ended up with a film of more than 3 hours. Nearly every scene was what I pictured it would be. The special effects were fantastic and the game of Quidditch was very spectacular. All the characters fitted effortlessly into the film and every actor was suited to the part they played. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were perfect as are three heroes, but every other actor involved helped to bring the book to life, however brief their appearance.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the books then I recommend you do so before or after seeing the film.

I won't give away the ending to anyone who doesn't know what happens. <br/><br/>Adults and kids alike will enjoy this, I did and I'm not under 12.

"slerp","Null","0","0","20 November 2001"," Faithful but not perfect
","As a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, I never really expected this movie to come close and - to be honest - it doesn't. Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie but it only really touches on the surface of J.K. Rowling's world. It's clear that what has happened here is that Chris Columbus has made a film that's true to the book... then realised it's too long and cut out all the unnecessary bits. What's left is a somewhat bitty and shallow version of the story with little of the richness and colour that made The Philosopher's Stone such a standout book.<br/><br/>What we do see, for the most part, looks great. I found myself wondering just how the filmmakers had managed to recreate Hogwarts exactly as I had imagined it, from the warmth of the Gryffindor common room to the dampness of Snape's potions class. Unfortunately, they seem to have fallen under the same spell as George Lucas when it comes to computer generated imagery. Quite simply, it looks fake. Particularly cringe-able are the centaur that looks straight out of Ray Harryhausen's reject bin (Surely they could put a guy in a suit!) and the face of Lord Voldemort that looks like a character from Tekken 3. I hope and pray that filmmakers get over their obsession with technology and realise how bad some of this stuff looks.<br/><br/>Where this film really triumphs is in the performances of some (not all) of the cast. Daniel Radcliffe certainly looks the part, although his is not the most challenging role, as it involves little more than looking bewildered for most of the film. Of the other kids, Rupert Grint stands out a mile. His delivery is natural and his comic timing absolutely flawless. Sean Biggerstaff also impresses a great deal during his short screen time as Oliver Wood. <br/><br/>The adults were picked from the cream of british thesps, but only a handful really seem to understand the material. Robbie Coltrane captures Hagrid perfectly, and Alan Rickman is a superbly slimy Snape. Maggie Smith, as Professor McGonagall, is outstanding. Ian Hart, on the other hand is merely mediocre as st-st-stuttering Professor Quirrel and downright embarrassing when he turns nasty at the climax of the film. Richard Harris as Dumbledore is a little bit po-faced for my liking. I would have liked to have heard him say a few more words at the banquet(Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! )<br/><br/>So as an adaptation of a book, it's admirably faithful, if a little shallow, while as a children's film, it's certainly above average.<br/><br/>

Director Chris Columbus was able to stick with the book, and it's content, very well.  All the most important parts were included in the movie, and it left me wanting more.<br/><br/>The special effects were up to par, and the Qudditch scene was just astonishing.  Many times throughout the entire film, I saw myself reading the books at home and imagining just what I was seeing on the big screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I have to give this film a 10 out of 10!  It has superb special effects.  The movie stays true and very close to the book.  The all British cast only adds to the magic that is present.  I wasn't upset with any one part, and when the show was over, I got up, applauded, and just wanted more, more, more.  I would recommend this film to anyone over the age of six or seven, and would just like to say that I hope it goes all the way to the box office record books and beats all the records."

","Wizards have entered my brain and made me so confused. At least this is the impression I have from viewing the new Harry Potter film. Harry Potter has become an icon to the western world in recent years and with the skyrocketing sales of his last adventure, Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, it seemed only fitting that a film should follow and thus, abracadabra, with but a budget in hand, it came to be.<br/><br/>The world seems to rave at his wonder, as Harry Potter, the abused orphaned boy, is taken from his horrid relatives to study at Hogwart?s Academy of Wizards, a place where children of certain magical lines learn to perform magic that can never be performed in the outside world. Unfortunately, this film should have stayed in that mystical realm. Like The Grinch Who Stole Christmas and the recent remake of Planet of the Apes, this is another film with a story that rambles, filled with two-dimensional characters, that struggle their way through the special effects. Amazingly, Steve Kloves, who had previously scripted Flash and Bone and The Fabulous Baker Boys, this time steps up to the plate and misses as does Christopher Columbus, director of Home Alone, Home Alone 2, Mrs. Doubtfire and Bicentennial Man. Those were comedies. This is not.<br/><br/>Grinchlike, the first flaws are apparently from the lack of perspective. Every angle in every scene is shot hideously close. Seldom is there anything but close-ups of everyone and everything. There is a sense of suffocation. But then, this film, like the Grinch, was made with the eventual dvd sales in mind, to be shown on a small screen. The opening shot starts out muddy, both in plot and in the graininess of the film, and eventually describes how Harry Potter got the sorcerer?s stone, a piece of glowing rock that has little to do with most of the story of Harry?s birth to depth struggle as wizard boy of legendary fame, who as a small child was able to inexplicably defeat the greatest of all evils. The fact of the matter is that as a wizard, Harry is not all that wizardly. His greatest skill seems to be that he can ride a broom better than any of the other wiz kids, but in the spells department, he is just smoke and mirrors. Why the film was not just called Hogwart?s is beyond me, for Harry Potter himself is of little significance to the film, other than the fact that everyone knows from the start that he has to be the one to save the day if only because his name is in the title.<br/><br/>While none of the kids playing the parts really had any prior acting experience, each handles their roles quite well. Film legend, Richard Harris had his career magically resurrected to star in this spell of tedium. The rest of the cast are generally well-suited to their roles. And that is where any chance the film had ends. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer?s Stone might have been a decent film. The problem is that Kloves made the mistake of so many of his profession in trying to translate too much of the bound volume and make it work on the screen. The result was a jumble of scenes, none of which depended on each other or held to a single storyline. I remember thinking to myself as I yawned my way through the more than two hours of this less than magical film, why could it not have been more like Young Sherlock Holmes?<br/><br/>No doubt I will be in the minority in my views of this big budgeted event. No doubt there are so many Harry Potter fans who look for anything Harry Potter, like the Star Wars diehards a generation ago, that I would be sorcerousy stoned if I spake these words in plain sight. But I went to the cinema looking for magic and watched only some slight of hand."

"caulin","Null","0","0","19 November 2001"," Surely bloody wicked, though left wanting because...
","... of the following simple objective points:<br/><br/>On the plus side: Robbie Coltrane brings a swell of 'good guy' feeling with his role - perfect casting. The other adult cast members are well cast - a magic fit indeed - though not enough Madam Hooch. What we see in the movie, is true to the book subject to some adaptation and severe compression/consolidation of the storyline - not all the 'key' scenes from the book are in there. Rupert Grint - a total natural it would seem, though I think we should all know how he auditioned by now - he could just record it and play it at interviews.  He actually participated (by his own admission during an interview) anonymously in a Newsround's (a UK children's news show) discussion group - good on him - I hope he embraces the Internet opportunities. Tom Feldon as Draco shows his commercial experience well though doesn't look quite 'bad'/'evil' enough.<br/><br/>On the minus: Daniel Radcliffe - one of the most commercially experienced young actors in the movie unfortunately tends to over deliver his lines in a hurried unnatural pantomime fashion, though his facial expressions are dead on as a plus.  Sorry Daniel; you may have still been awe-struck at getting the part, but hopefully you'll ease into it later on - you definately looked a bit giddy on the US television interviews (e.g. sitting behind Robbie on the Rosie O'Donnell show).  The fact that his dialogue is few and far between relative to the duration of the movie doesn't give him much to get his teeth into - and I don't think that Chris Columbus' pantomime styling helped despite due praise otherwise. We should bear in mind that in this first story, things happen to Harry rather than him leading the action, which could be why he appears too passive when combined with the shear number of scenes he appears in.  There are inconsistent stories as to how Daniel got the role, other than at the last minute - he said on an interview I saw that 'his father knew the producer' while others state that he was spotted at a theatre (not a movie theatre) by the producer, was lost in the crowd and found later on due to work connections - would like to hear the true/consistent story on that. Alan Rickman's short presence on screen - a pity, but he doesn't need the exposure. John Cleese's short presence on screen - unless this sets something important for the sequel screen-plays he could have been chopped just like the Peeves character - and a bit silly that his name was at the top of the credits. We didn't see enough of the Dursleys given their importance is defining the extreme Muggle case. Over visualisation - not enough character building and dialogue nor atmosphere and suspense. Not enough Quidditch - whizzed by far too quickly. Emma Watson - a bit too giddy (including on tv interviews) and a little over-acted but solid nonetheless. It was 2.5 hours long yet if you've read the book you may find yourself feeling short-changed.  WB should consider two parts from next year, so than can do two 1.5 hour movies for books 2 and 3 and two 2.5 hour movies for book 4.  I'm sure someone will attempt to make (though hopefully JK Rowling will not allow it) this into a hideous cartoon series of constantly yelling characters like certain Japanese cartoons I could mention.<br/><br/>I'm sure we will not see the DVD until next summer, and perhaps later if WB is feeling 'cruel', but if it doesn't have hours of deleted scenes on it or a 4-hour Director's cut, they'll probably be hell to pay from the fans.<br/><br/>At this point, if WB changes the core 3 cast fans will probably revolt and it makes sense to go year-for-year (fictional aging to real aging) despite them not all being 11.<br/><br/>An 8.7 for this movie."

","Why this movie is so great...<br/><br/>1) It's perfectly cast. Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter. Rupert Grint & Emma Watson are both excellent as Harry's loyal sidekicks, Ron & Hermione. Richard Harris is perfect as Dumbledore (exactly as I pictured him). Maggie Smith is great as the strict Professor MacGonagall. Alan Rickman is amazing as Snape, he doesn't have many lines but he delivers all of them SO well. Ian Hart is fantastic as Quirrell (he makes that stutter sound very believable). Robbie Coltrane is absolutely perfect as Hagrid. But...I don't think the Dursleys were quite evil enough, although they were very good, though.<br/><br/>2) It's VERY faithful to the book. They only left out a few very minor details that weren't worth putting in anyways.<br/><br/>3) Fast-paced. Everything goes by quickly, but that's good, because the movie is still 2 and a half hours long, and again, they didn't leave anything major out.<br/><br/>4) QUIDDITCH. This is absolutely the BEST action-sequence EVER caught on film. IT'S SIMPLY AMAZING! EXACTLY how I pictured it!<br/><br/>5) GREAT visual effects! The magic, trolls, Voldemorte, transformations, bla, bla, bla...It's all SO perfect!<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The Best Movie of the Year, possibly decade!"

","As an avid fan of the Harry series, I found it harder to sleep November 16th than any December 24 I can remember.  The theatrical experience did not disappoint.  Scores of fans clapped and cheered throughout the movie.  And the reason is obvious.  Chris Columbus painstakingly detailed the essential elements of the book and brought a world that existed in the imagination to life.  While many have panned the movie as looking like a book on tape (see mean comments from New York Times), this is the highest complement that could be paid to the movie:  It is just like the books.  Well, maybe not just like it.  Of course certain scenes had to be excluded.  But the greatest brilliance of Columbus was in the selection of the scenes and artful editing for time.  The result is that every scene captures the essence of the characters and plot.  Of course every nuance and scene could not be included in such an introspective and intricate plot, but this valiant attempt is true to both die hard fans and those who will become fans when they enter the world of H. Potter!"

Some points of the film, however, were not quite conveyed as I would have hoped.  There were a number of places where events from the book were omitted.  This was to be expected, though, as was not too much of a disappointment.  The only real gripe I would have would be that some scenes were not accurate reflections of the book.

"rob-437","9","0","0","20 November 2001"," Close, but still not as good as the book!
","The one name that seems to be on the whole of the western world's lips is Harry Potter.  The books had been read, the news of the film heard and now enough people to create over 100 million pounds worth of sales have seen it. I, like crate-loads of others have read the book and waited for the film and I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>From the moment the John Williams score kicks in at the beginning (reminiscent of the score that he created for Hook), and the view of an average road in Britain comes into view the tingling feeling builds of something so normal-looking can suddenly feel very magical and that is the key for this film working.<br/><br/>The sets and scenery are wonderfully thought out, created and used, with the correct mix of CG and real locations, costumes and props, especially Alnwick Castle and Gloucester Cathedral.  This comes as a refreshing change to those films which use CG to excess or do not use it right.  The highlight of the CG is the quidditch game, which really does give a good feel of what would happen.<br/><br/>The acting was also superb, with the veterans doing their job brilliantly in showing the skill that they have without over-powering the younger cast members.  Richard Harris brings the dignity that was seen in Gladiator when he played the role of the old emperor; The portrayal of one who knows that he has the power but does not want to force it on others comes across very well.  Maggie Smith comes shining through with role of Professor McGonagal, with Robbie Coltrane being the closest at stealing the thunder away from the youngsters in his role of Hagrid.<br/><br/>And onto the younger cast members.  The pressure that they had to live up to was handled very well, with Rupert Grint and Emma Watson providing good supporting roles whilst Daniel Radcliffe carries the role of Harry himself very well.  There are times at which he does seem to be a little overpowered by some of the others but this seems to emphasise the position that the character could be in, of everyone else seeming to know more about him than he does.  It will be interesting to see how the character has changed by the next film.<br/><br/>The only downside is that due to the level of detail and writing skills of the author some parts have had to be cut out from the film.  As it is the film is two an a half hours long and there was still at least another 1 hours-worth of back story which could have been told!  It is an unenviable position for the screenwriter to be in.  For those who have read the book, enough is known to leave certain parts out, and the story still making sense, but then face the wrath of the audience for the parts that are missed out (mainly pre-Hogwarts), yet for those who have not read the book but want to see what the fuss is about then some key things may be missed (mainly the Dursley's going insane [for comical value!) and the real development of relationships between Harry and his family).<br/><br/>It is worth seeing this film if only to complement the imagery of the book. All involved have provided exactly what was required to allow the story to be bought to life without overdoing it; don't use it as a substitute!  Roll on the next one; book and film!"

","Too much time was spent dwelling on special effects and character portrayal versus the actually story line.  Don't get me wrong, the effects were outstanding, the sets amazing and the characters were truly brought to life in their fullest form.  Ninety-Nine percent of the scenes brought to life were incredibly accurate and wonderful.<br/><br/>The movie, for what it told of the story of the Sorcerer's Stone was too long.  Two and half hours and one Quidditch match?  What about Malfoy meeting Harry in Diagon Alley, they just skipped that completely!  There were several other scenes either entirely ignored or modified, which I found disappointing.  There wasn't a whole lot of development for much of the supporting student case (Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, the rest of the Weasley's). Did they even say Hedwig's name once?  If they did I missed it.<br/><br/>I was left with mixed feelings at the end of the movie.  I felt what was told was great, but what wasn't told was an injustice to a wonderful story. If you're a purist then I don't recommend this movie, if you enjoy movies go see it - its a great experience in cinema."

","I've read the books, so it's hard not to compare the movie to them. However, I will say that I thought it did an excellent job at capturing the mood and the look of the books.  The casting was dead-on, and the performances, even by actors with only one or two scenes, were outstanding.<br/><br/>
I did find a few unsettling bits... The character development needed to be worked on a bit more.  Columbus followed a bit too closely with the book, and didn't visualize enough of the character's inner feelings in the beginning.  Also, the editing at the beginning was jerky and odd.  too many hops, and for someone unfamiliar with the books, they'd be confusing.<br/><br/>
But starting with the Quidditch match, the movie hit its stride and started being awesome.  The match was what the Phantom Menace pod race should have been.  I knew the outcome, but it was dazzling to watch and I wasn't really sure if Gryffindor would win.  The next best scene was the chess match at the end, where Ron Weasley shines - excellent emotion from such a young actor.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe was excellent as Harry, with his scenes getting better towards the end.  His turning point from an okay performance to a great performance was the Mirror scene where he sees his parents.<br/><br/>
Alan Rickman as Snape was perfectly sinister.  His words hissed out his mouth and worked their way under your skin.  However, more could have been done with Prof. McGonagall - the scene where she scolds Harry and Ron was too short and we don't even find out what she teaches - we just see her morph from a cat.  I was disappointed there.  More Flitwick would have been nice, as well.<br/><br/>Oliver Wood was a nice addition, as was Percy Weasley.  Draco showed the best acting of the young characters, in my opinion, but it's always easier and more fun to be bad.  However, he did inject a bit of human-ness into his character.<br/><br/>Loved Voldemort at the end, and the winking Harry in the mirror was an excellent touch - I hope in the next movies they let Harry be a little more like his mirror reflection.<br/><br/>However, even at 2.5 hours, I felt it was too short!  I wanted more!  More might have been accomplished with better ending - less quick scenes.  The longer scenes worked out much better.  Here's hoping the DVD shows the whole 4-hour original rough cut.<br/><br/>I give it 3.5 stars out of 4.  The jumpy editing and jerky character development at the beginning are almost made up for by the strong ending hour, but not quite."
"LinaInverse23","10","0","0","19 November 2001"," EXCELLENT!
","I had never read any of the books before, and had only heard about them before I went to see this movie.  I wanted to see it because it looked very good, and the preview reminded me of one of my favorite Chris Columbus films Young Sherlock Holmes.  YSH captures the essence of old Britain with the same magical style as Harry Potter.  When I finally saw the movie, I was presently surprised at the brilliance and wit contributed by the writer, the director, and especially the actors.  It surprised me because I never thought a children's book could become such an involved and magical subject. The child actors seemed more like adults, but enhanced the genius of the film.  When you see child actors in movies such as Jake Lloyd, you watch them closely, as if they aren't as good as the other adults.  These actors were remarkable, especially the three main characters.  But I don't want to give these guys all the credit, let's not forget the excellent adult actors they have in the film.  Richard Harris was especially remarkable as the headmaster of Hogwart's.  Every time I saw him, I thought of a brilliant aged wizard, who knows all and has seen all.  I was also impressed with Alan Rickman's Severus Snape who was a great character and am hoping they continue his presence in the other films.  I have followed Rickman from different movies because I love his acting style, and he was perfect for this role.  Everything seemed to come to life in its own magical way. Kids filled the theater with laughter and surprises.  They were having so much fun with this, and I can only imagine how much better the movie might have been, had I read the book.  A film of this magnitude produces so much hype, it might have turned out to be another dude.  But I can say now that this movie is not just hype, it is entirely substance.  This movie could have been brilliant without the hype.  I completely forgot about the real world when I entered the world of Harry Potter.  So forget everything, relax, and enjoy a film full of magic and adventures fulfilled only by the wonderful Harry Potter."

","I saw Harry Potter film Saturday morning at 10.35 in Odeon Harrogate.<br/><br/>Ive read the books and went with 2 seven year olds (boy and girl) and my wife. Of the four of us only my wife hadn't read the book.<br/><br/>We all enjoyed the film very much including my wife who had doubts initially about sitting through a film nearly 2 1/2 hours long. The children sat and watched it without any moments where there attention strayed. It flies by.<br/><br/>I've never seen a film twice at the cinema but I intend to see this one again because there's so much to it.<br/><br/>The special effects are great and the film reminds me of a cross between Raiders of the Lost Ark and say an Enid Blyton Famous Five Film. However, its very English so it will be intersting to see what the Americans think. Its pure escapism with another World..Hogwarts School being created. In that sense there's no clash with the horrors of Sept 2001.<br/><br/>The costume design/ sets are brilliant ..eg Gringotts Wizard Bank and Diagon Alley Wizard shops (and the Gringotts goblins). The Move from London 2001 into Wizard London is magical as is the Kings Cross scenes.<br/><br/>All the actors are well cast, Richard Harris (who I've never been keen on plays a brilliant Albus Dumbledore)<br/><br/>The 3 main child actors are very good; they don't come over like some slightly obnoxious Annakin SkyWalker in Star Wars.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is fairly straight good guy ; so its a difficult part to play as like Superman he doesn't have much character. Ron Weasly is the character and he really looks the part with a distinctive rubbery face. Hermione Granger is bossy, very pretty and plays a strong part.<br/><br/>What you start to realise is how much has to be left out of a film which sticks very close,timewise,plotwise to the book. To portray the book in full would take a ten hour film so lots have to go eg Draco Malfoys first meeting with Harry on the train and rat scabbers attack and Hermiones logic challenge after Ron's Chess game beating up.<br/><br/>The stars (John Hurt , Cleese, Julie Walters etc etc ) all play great parts though one soon realises how cut down the characters have to be to get the main storyline in.<br/><br/>There are memorable scenes (and quite scary ones at that). (so not suitable I'd say for any under fives). The film will however appeal to adults as well as kids. <br/><br/>1) The Quidditch Match 2) The Wizard Chess Game 3) The Troll on the loose in Hogwarts 4) The encounter with Voldemort at the end. 5) Gringotts security systems.<br/><br/>I'm just giving a general flavour of a film which in my opinion is far superior to the last Star Wars and which is even better than Toy Story/Bugs Life.<br/><br/>My opinion is that this Harry Potter film will not just be a hyped wonder but will last a long long time in terms of popularity and staying power; it will thus do well on Video/DVD when the time comes but prior to that will enjoy a long run at the box office.<br/><br/>Cheers"

If you do this, the movie is great fun.  One note of caution:  there are several ""scary"" scenes which may be too intense for small children and I counted at least 3 ""minor"" uses of profanity."

","In my vote for this movie, I gave it a 9 (out of ten).  This was a combination of the first thirty minutes, which were a 10, followed by the remainder of the movie being an eight.  If you've read the book, you'll get chills as the beginning sequences of the movie makes you feel the same way as the book did.  This is true movie magic at its best.  After getting past the introduction and settling into the story, the movie sometimes drags a little, but it will still keep your interest.  Despite the length of the movie, there is still plenty left out.  I'd be curious to hear what someone who hasn't read the book thinks about the movie.<br/><br/>As far as the casting goes, I was especially pleased with the Dursleys. Hermione was also quite well done, as was Hagrid (but was Hagrid really that illiterate in the book???).<br/><br/>Oh, and is it just me, or were you also disappointed in the size of the Great Hall.  It just didn't come close to matching my imagination! :-)"

"weblore","10","0","0","19 November 2001"," An acquired taste
","I went to opening night and got a horribly mixed feeling about the movie. I just could NOT get into the film for the first full hour, but once Harry saw the mirror, I was very much into it. But that first hour bothered me all night after I got home. During the film I couldn't help but think about what wasn't there, at home I couldn't stop thinking that I SHOULD have liked it, but something was wrong. I LOVED the last hour and a half, but that first hour....<br/><br/>I finally came to the conclusion that I had to see the movie a second time as soon as possible. While in line Saturday, an acquaintance of mine asked if I noticed that the Dolby system was off for the first hour of the opening run. I was livid! I realized that that was what the problem was!<br/><br/>
When I saw the movie again, I was able to completely fall into the film and lose the 'adaptation' thing. As a movie by itself, I think it is wonderful! My second go was SO much better than the first time. I was in awe! The movie DOES have a charm to it. It is NOT the same charm as the book, but it's got its own charm. It is more like 'the Wizard of Oz' kind of charm.<br/><br/>
I felt that the movie was more European to me, the first time I saw it. It SHOULD be more European! But like some of my favorite European movies, it's a bit of an acquired taste.<br/><br/>By the second time I saw it, I certainly acquired the right taste for this film! It is lovely through and through. It is in no way anything compared to the book. However, I put this up there with the 'Wizard of Oz' and the original 'Star Wars' trilogy, completely separated from the book.<br/><br/>
It is a fiercely faithful 'adaptation,' but whereas the story is from the mind of JK Rowling, the heart of the movie is from Chris Columbus. He has a wonderful, dark imagination that fits very well in the HP world. It's just that getting used to his heart takes time after being so used to JKR's.<br/><br/>
I felt that the acting was superb from everyone. People with the smallest parts, like John Hurt, treated their characters as though they were fully formed, and the whole movie rested on their performance.<br/><br/>
The main characters were perfect. Robbie Coltrane IS Hagrid. I actually like his character even more! I can't believe Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were newcomers because their acting was so good, but then again I can BECAUSE their acting was so good. But my favorite performance was Daniel Radcliffe's. It's not because I think he's a doll, which he is, but he truly is Harry! Not once did he overstate his character, like so many child actors do. His reactions were true to the character, and the movie rides comfortably on his shoulders.<br/><br/>I found what I loved the most about the movie is what I love about the books. Even though the story takes place in a fantastic world that could easily turn artificial, everything and everyone just seem so normal for that world that it's completely believable. I think that Chris Columbus understood that part of the books and, also, shares in that philosophy. I don't think any other director could have pulled that off as well as he did.<br/><br/>
I can now HONESTLY say, without a doubt, that I LOVE this movie! It is not the Harry Potter I fell in love with, but I love this Harry Potter, too."

","I took a 7-year-old girl who had never read the books, a 17-year-old girl who had read all of the books and a 44-year-old man...my family.  They all enjoyed the film, but had different opinions.  The 17-year-old thought it was missing something and hoped that people would read the books before seeing the film.  Her creative vision differed from Columbus.  The 7-year-old was glued to the screen and didn't utter a word, the 44-year-old was enjoying watching the girls react and found it amusing.  I enjoy Chris Columbus' films, but this one seemed to be lacking finesse.  Though the story was told well it just didn't feel quite right.

","When I read the first Harry Potter book six months ago, I felt that I was reading something very special.  Indeed, an entire generation of children are growing up with something that is so wondrous and exciting, that it pales anything like it to date.  This film captures the magic of the books beautifully.  From John William's magical score, to the fast-paced Quidditch match, to the 4-star cast, this film IS Harry Potter, realized as best as humanly possible.  The trio of child actors portraying Harry, Ron, and Hermoine have perfect chemistry.  The supporting players, Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Richard Griffiths, and especially Alan Rickman are perfect. The one casting that just blows my socks off is that of Robbie Coltrane playing the role of the giant Hagrid.  Coltrane has fun with this role, making Hagrid a perfect mentor/guide for Harry Potter as he enters this new, magical world.  Chris Columbus has done a terrific job creating this world, which could easily have been watered-down and lost in budget cuts. Excellent film."

","I read the 1st Harry Potter book early this year, and like millions of other was enchanted by the tales of this young boy. When I saw the preview to the movie I thought to myself ""this could be great, as long as they stay true to the book and have good casting.""<br/><br/>Well, my criteria was filled beyond expectation. Often books are changed to be made more exciting, more screen ready. They realized that save very few things, the book was very adaptable to the big screen already, and didn't need to change the story. And not only did Columbus stay true to the book, he went above and beyond in portraying everything as close to Rowling's vision as possible.<br/><br/>The casting is perfect, from Harry to Hagrid to Nearly Headless Nick. All the teachers are cast to a tee, as are Harry and his partners in crime, Hermione and Ron. Emma Watson, Rupert Grit and Danial Radcliffe do a perfect job portraying the Overacheiving Hermione, the carefree Ron and the quiet but determined Harry respectivly.<br/><br/>The perfect cast also gets to parade around in the perfectly realized world of Hogwarts. The attention to detail is something I haven't seen since Titanic. Even when no attention is being paid to the portraits in the background, the people in them are still moving. Most amazing of all to me is the realization of the Quidditch match in a dizzying sequence. Though explained very well, it is still hard to imagine the matchs when reading the books, but the match in the movie is fast and exciting.<br/><br/>I am giving this movie a 9, and the only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because while I enjoyed it very much, my friend who hadn't read the book seemed a bit bored during some parts, and I can see where she would be bored while people who have read it would be captivated. I am looking forward to the sequal, because I think they will be able to put less emphasis on all the different places and effect and more on the story and characters.<br/><br/>But it's a wonderful movie, with great casting, great effects and a true to the book story, what more could we ask for?"

","Naysayers and those without magic or childish wonder in their souls aren't going to like my thoughts on the ""Harry Potter"" phenomenon. The movie is a brilliant melange of eye-popping wondrous visual effects and the finest British theatrical talent that money can buy. Those who demean and continually whinge on about the film are, IMHO, just jealous over the unparalleled success that Ms. Rowling's creations have enjoyed, the likes of which we haven't seen since a small American film named ""Star Wars"" opened in 1977, and quickly became the stuff of cultural legend. Ms. Rowling's characters and settings spring from the same mixture of folklore, mythology, and clear-cut good vs. evil story-telling as her fellow British writers of generations past, namely J.R.R.Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Roald Dahl. They have all managed to slip important lessons about morality, the nature of existence, and why concepts of honor, loyalty, and friendship are vital to the well-being of humanity, all without being heavy-handed or overly treacly in their fervor and desire to instill these values in our children. A finer assemblage of British talent could not be assembled on a single motion picture sound stage: Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt, John Cleese, Julie Walters, Zoe Wanamaker. The three young people essaying the lead roles acquitted themselves marvelously and have bright shining futures ahead of them , in whatever industry they choose. If they're smart, they won't take any notice of the mean and spiteful comments made about them by grown-ups who have clearly forgotten the simple joys of childhood. They should contact Jake Lloyd about how mean and cruel grown-ups can be, in terms of performances in a franchise that hard-core fantasy/science-fiction enthusiasts have adopted as a religion. Read the books, enjoy the fabulous and enchanting movie, recapture the excitement and thrill of being transported to a magical and carefree place where the villains can all be identified by their black hats and are easily vanquished by conjuring tricks and the power of witchcraft. If your heart is already black with the diseases of cynicism, jaded indifference, and the mistaken belief that flash cars and cell phones make you special, leave the rest of us to enjoy the dream and curl up in your own."

","There is no doubt that whatever is said in reviews over the next few weeks about this film, will not effect the inevitable box office success that Harry Potter is destined to deliver. Judging by the amount of anticipation surrounding the movie, it is possible that many editors will be scared to publish critical reviews for fear of being branded as heretics! It is good to know then that on the whole the movie is a thoroughly entertaining affair that follows the true spirit of fantastical adventure. The casting is superb even if the well-known faces such as John Clease and Julie Walters often only appear very briefly.  Robbie Coltrane stands out from the main cast as an inspired choice and manages to bring a certain charm that enchants the audience whilst the slimier than ever Alan Rickman reminds as all why he plays the ultimate bad lad. As for the children's characters, there are a variety of talents on offer with Daniel Radcliffe putting in a fine performance in the lead role and a reassuringly annoying Emma Watson as the oh so highly strung Hermione. <br/><br/>There is no doubt that the young as well as the young at heart will be convulsing with joy at the adventure sequences as well as the 'out of this world' nature of the production. However the entertainment and especially the laughs may be a little thin on the ground for those without younger relatives to coo over. The trend in recent years for films which entertain all age groups including the grown ups with cross over humor and adventure such as Toy Story, Shrek and the upcoming Monsters Inc may well cause some people to expect more from the Rowling cash cow. <br/><br/>This movie really is a children's film and if you are a grown up without a child's heart then you may well find yourself disappointed. However if you accept the film as a young-uns adventure then you should be dragging the tykes back to the multiplex again and again although I don't suppose they will put up too much of a fight."

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone <br/><br/>I've never read the Harry Potter books and probably never will. But as for the movie, I found it surprisingly good. I certainly didn't expect much from Chris Columbus, the director of Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire, but his version of Harry Potter is quite a success. I must admit, however, that Columbus could hardly foul things up because the film contains about two-thirds of the book, much of Rowling's dialogue verbatim, and brilliant casting.<br/><br/>The over 153-minute running time of the film is a result of Chris Columbus' slavish faithfulness to book. But don't misunderstand me; I barely felt it. In the opening scenes with Harry's horrible stepfamily, the pacing is a little slow, and so I did start to worry. But that was for naught. The first third of the movie is actually a kind respite doled out to those, like me, who haven't read the book. Rather, this film later hustles and bustles along at an action film's pace. (One critic, referring to the action and look of the film, called it a kind of Indiana Jones for kids.)<br/><br/>
That leads me to one of my few quibbles with Harry Potter. I urgently wish the film had slowed down a bit more. By the film's end, I doubt that much of the non-fan audience was aware that one year had passed on screen, had it not been announced by one of the characters. Yes, we receive important visual cues, such as the jack o' lanterns for October and the snow and Christmas trees for winter, but signaling the passage of time in a film is not merely limited to those sorts of things. It's a minor point nonetheless.<br/><br/>All the way through, I didn't feel like I was watching a painfully dreadful kid's film. Instead, I got something that was thoroughly entertaining for both adults and children. Mainly, what worked for me was the completeness of Rowling's world. It seemed as though every possible detail of her imaginary world was fully realized to point that I was convinced--within the confines of the movie theatre, of course--that Harry Potter's magical world was real--more than mere make believe. Frankly, I was enchanted.<br/><br/>
This kind of film, of course, relies heavily on special effects. They, unfortunately, were only adequate at best. In these days of Jurassic Park realism, the bar of what's acceptable is now amazingly high. But no matter.<br/><br/>Besides a well thought out story, Harry Potter has a wonderful cast. Of course, the excellence of the Who's Who British cast of celebrities (the adults) is a given. But the emphasis of the story is on a trio of unknowns who did a damn good job. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are superb together. Their chemistry is just right. My only worry about these three, as they stand atop a billion dollar empire, is what torture they'll have to endure while make-up and costuming try their darnedest to keep these pubes looking like innocent--well, on second thought, not-so-innocent--young wizards for at least another couple films.<br/><br/>In all, I was surprised to no end. While shaky at first, the film showed itself to be a clear winner. <br/><br/>Worth seeing a second time.<br/><br/>9/10"

Well in fact, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I had a hundred questions for my wife about the books afterward and will likely now find some time to read the books so I can see how it compares. I found the world J.K. Rowling created to be quite charming and full of a life of its own. Hogwarts was nothing short of stunning in its concept and rendering. Kudos to the actors too...Alan Rickman was FANTASTIC (but then he usually is) and the child actors were well chosen and very likeable. Daniel Radcliffe was a tad shallow of emotion as Harry, but not nearly so much as I was lead to believe by the critics. In short, if you have any doubts, go see this movie. You won't be disappointed even if you aren't a rabid fan of the books."

I was impressed by the clarity of the plot and the nearly perfect scenery that was breathtaking and exactly what the movie called for.  One of the high points of the film is the wonderful Hermione Granger, the teachers pet and the makings of an outstanding wizard, she appealed to me more so than any other character. Not that the other actors weren't perfect choices, but she seemed to be the ideal child to embody Rowlings character.  Overall I was impressed and dazzled by the entire film, I found myself laughing and clapping my hands with glee as the English train station became platform 9 3/4.  Even people who haven't read the book will find themselves wishing for just one day at the magical children before them.

Others say that that same scene X was not relevant and thus rightfully excluded. Some people say it was too watered down and childish. Others say it was too scary and inappropriate for kids. Sheesh!<br/><br/>All in all, I thought it was pretty good. Both my girlfriend, who hadn't read any of the books, and I, who read the first 2, enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The only complaint that I would agree with is that the movie was slightly too long. At a hefty 152 minutes, I overheard several viewers afterwards who said that they fell asleep. Although I never fell asleep, I certainly became tired at moments.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the mid-movie Quidditch match added a much needed jolt of electricity. Although the CGI occasionally was too apparent, all in all the Quidditch scene was exciting and engaging, achieving what Phantom Menace's ho-hum pod race could not.<br/><br/>Acting overall was pretty good. Daniel Radcliffe as HP was adequate, but the real show stealers were Rupert Grint(Ron) as the goofy but loyal sidekick and Emma Watson(Hermione) as the perfectly charming, bookish snob.

","It was all I wanted it to be, and I'm a grown-up.  My husband and I did notice a breaking down of narrative logic about half-way through the movie, and we forgive it this time, but I hope when the other movies are filmed, the scriptwriter/s remember to show Harry and the kids putting the parts of the problem together.<br/><br/>There were some poor choices of scenes to keep and scenes to discard; for some reason, my husband wanted to see the logic problem with the potion bottles that Hermione solves--he claims it would make the awarding of points to her at the year-end dinner logical.  I would have appreciated another scene with Snape at the end of the movie (just because I like Alan Rickman), either to explain why he was being a hard-case on Harry, or at least Dumbledore should have explained it in the infirmary [and if you're impatient, Snape and James Potter, Harry's father, detested each other as much as Harry and Malfoy do, but James did something Snape could never forgive him for--James saved Snape's life, so Snape felt he owed a payback to Harry].<br/><br/>At no point in the movie do we learn that Dumbledore sent the Invisibility cloak to Harry for Christmas, nor do we see Harry in the nice sweater (that's 'jumper' in British) that Mrs. Weasley knit him.  It would have been nice if there were a montage of months between each of the significant scenes in the movie; remember, the book covered a whole school year, we don't actually get a sense of that on the screen. It would have been nice if Warwick Davis, who plays Professor Flitwick, didn't have as much prosthetics on his face; and it would have been nice if the Potions laboratory wasn't quite so dark (doing alchemy in the dark is not safe!)."

","It would be churlish to say I was disappointed.  I've been wondering for a couple of days what the right word is, and I think I've come up with ""crestfallen"".  One comment I heard (from an adult) was ""great - when can we see the full-length version?"" and I think that about sums it up.<br/><br/>Effects and cinematography were immaculate and the casting was inspired in at least one case.  Robbie Coltrane was born to play Rubeus Hagrid! Sadly Coltrane was one of the few performers allowed to show their talent.<br/><br/>Scenes like Diagon Alley were just as I imagined them and this is a superb Hogwarts Great Hall (I *loved* the floating candles).  Other effects like the  wall into Diagon Alley and the unicorn blood were reminiscent of some of the  effects seen in ""The Matrix"".  Thanks Dolby Labs for inventing the surround  sound system - quidditch balls flying overhead added the final touch to a  fantastic action scene.  The only scene that didn't fit was, to<br/><br/>me, The Leaky  Cauldron (a medieval drinking hole in central London would be crammed with  tourists - this should have been a dusty rundown neo-Victorian place, in my view).<br/><br/>So why ""crestfallen""?  It seemed to me that to fit this movie into a viewable  length (152 minutes) all too much was squeezed out.  The plot was extremely  linear and, in some cases, would have made very little sense to anyone (if there  *is* anyone!) who hadn't read the book. Though this is, of course, a childrens' film the book on which it's based has much richer subplot and characterisation.<br/><br/>Some important characterisation went by the wayside (it was never mentioned, for instance, that Ron was an excellent chess player although he and Harry were seen playing chess at one point) and plot lines like Norbert (Hagrid's Norwegian Ridgeback dragon) were so trimmed as to become almost incomprehensible.  John Cleese's Nearly Headless Nick was just about completely headless.<br/><br/>This applies to characterisation as well as plot- the only characters who seemed to be developed were Hagrid and Hermione (Emma Watson) - everyone else, including  Harry, were played in a fairly emotionless way. I felt for instance that some of Snape's (Alan Rickman) best sarcasm had ended up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Apart from a severely trimmed plot, this movie lacked emotion.  The book is warm - this was rather cold.  I found myself not caring very much what happened to Harry.<br/><br/>One thing does worry me.  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's (or Sorceror's) Stone is 223 pages long. If the book has been compressed this much is anything beyond two films practicable? Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (the fourth book) is over 600 pages with a complex plot; how much of it would survive?"
"Richard Jackson","Null","0","0","11 November 2001"," A magical thrill ride - Fans of the book rejoice!
","I have to admit, I was ready to hate this movie. Having been a long-term fan of the Harry Potter books, a less-than-faithful adaptation could have spoiled it all for me. As it turns out, my fears were unfounded.<br/><br/>Okay, some viewers will nitpick over discrepencies in characters' appearances, but all the IMPORTANT stuff is here. The relationships between the characters are spot-on. The film also successfully convinces us that the magical goings-on are part of the protagonists' everyday lives, whilst at the same time instilling a sense of wonder in the audience. This difficult balance is one of the main reasons the books are so successful.<br/><br/>Some of the child actors are a little wooden at times, but generally the all-British cast is excellent. The rich characters of Rowling's books have translated perfectly. Robbie Coltrane IS Hagrid. Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) have immense fun delivering most of the film's best lines. Dan Radcliffe does well in the difficult task of communicating Harry's thoughts, when the audience is unable to see them written down. Deserved mention, too, for Maggie Smith's McGonagall, Alan Rickman's Snape and Tom Felton's nasty-yet-vulnerable Draco Malfoy.<br/><br/>The quality of the production is excellent. The sets and costumes are fabulous, and the attention to detail is breathtaking. The effects are superb, obvious highlights being Harry's invisibility cloak, and the Quidditch match (an adrenaline-pumping spectacle right up there with anything Star Wars has to offer).<br/><br/>In between the showpieces, director Chris Columbus remembers to let his audience take a breather with quieter moments. Harry staring out of his bedroom window, and he and Ron opening their presents on Christmas morning, are endearingly down-to-earth. And the scenes of Harry in front of the Mirror of Erised brought a tear to my eye (If you've read the book, you'll know why).<br/><br/>That's not to say the movie is without its faults. In an attempt to please purists, ALL the subplots have been included (though pared down a great deal), when omitting a few entirely may have helped the pacing of the film. The opening half-hour may be difficult to grasp for those who are unfamiliar with the book. A few of the magical artefacts seem rather more mechanical than mystical.<br/><br/>But these are all small niggles, really. The bottom line is that 152 minutes fly by as if it were half an hour. The only wish you have is that it were longer, and there can be no better sign of a good film than that."

","i'm a 23 year old guy and was forced to read the first book by my girlfriend. After that I read the other book willingly to say the least. Amazing charactors and story although the first book was a bit predictable (which obviously made the movie the same). I really don't think the movie stood up to the book though. A lot of things seemed rushed. Like all of a sudden the Dursley's were in a shack on an island?!! Of course I knew how they got there, but I can only imagine what a first time harry potter fan would think. They didn't show how the Dursleys were ""a little nice"" to Harry after getting back home. The Centaur scene also was a bit rushed. I know if they did it right along with the book the movie would be like 4 hours long but a little explination was needed at a few points. All in all if the movies are anything like the books at all they will just get better and better. The special effects, although not ILM, were a lot better than I was expecting even after seeing previews. The child actors were decent considering most of them haven't really had all that much experience. I should think that the acting department will get quite a bit better as the children have a bit of experience under thier belts and probably a few acting coaches. Hermione's lines seemed wierdly timed and Harry reminded me of countless school plays. Ron's charactor was my favorite, plus he got all the good lines. ""You're scary, do you know that? Brilliant, but scary."". All in all I had a great time. The theatre I saw it in was ghetto as can be seeing how all the theatres in my area are completely sold out for every showing for the next week.

","Although I did not read any of the books, I understand this movie follows the first book very closely, just not as much detail.  A great story with excellent acting and special effects.  Small children (under 8) may not be able to follow the plot because of the number of characters involved. However, it is a must see for everyone.  It is a very long movie (2 hours 33 minutes), but it never drags.  Get to the theater early to get a good seat."

","Columbus did a GREAT job with this movie.  The content was very consistent to the book, and he couldn't have chosen better actors for the roles. Harry Potter brings out the imagination in all of us and I don't know of any child who hasn't dreamt of flying.  The movie captured all of this and much more. The special effects were wonderful, and kept my children spell-bound, (no pun intended) the entire movie.

","I love the book series, and had been looking forward to this movie almost all year; still waiting impatiently for the 5th book.  Unfortunately, this first movie was a little disappointing.<br/><br/>I had no problem with the length, to follow the book they would have to run it a little longer than the average children's movie.  They should have made it a little longer and not left out some of the important parts; it mostly followed the book, but edited out a lot and made a few short cuts that strayed from the text slightly, even mixed a couple parts around.<br/><br/>The choices for actors were excellent in my opinion, though in some scenes they didn't behave in a realistic manner; not following the mood of the scene.  Also, as someone else pointed out, in the movie Harry's eyes were blue rather than green.<br/><br/>The graphics were pretty good, but they could have come up with some better ones; I've seen better mythological creatures in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.<br/><br/>However, even though the movie had some disappointing aspects, I enjoyed it overall; we'll probably buy the video(or DVD, if we ever get a player 8-p) as soon as it's released.  Perhaps they will do much better with the following movies; I look forward to seeing the next in the series."

I thought the newspaper reviews were just over hyping it by saying it was probably the best kids film ever made, they weren't.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this film. So the purists may say some bits of the book have been left out, and other bits changed (the release of Norbert the dragon being the biggest one in my opinion), but other than that the film is exactly how I imagined the book.<br/><br/>I didn't realise John Williams did the music until the end (although I began to suspect it during it). The whole chess game sequence was breath-taking, and Williams's music really builds the tension.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say that Alan Rickman was born to play Severus Snape, in much the same way Jack Nicholson was born to play the Joker in Batman.<br/><br/>A thoroughly enjoyable film, only 365 days until the next ones out!<br/><br/>Anthony."

"ItStinks","Null","0","0","18 November 2001"," Over-Rated, clap clap clapclap clap
","Clearly the movie was trying to be as faithful to the books as possible, but sacrificed a lot of character development for whiz-bang special effects. There was no built-up empathy with Potter, and not enough developed with the tight bond he forms with Ron and Hermione.  It would have served the movie better to have shot Hermione not seated with or really associated with Ron and Harry until after the bathroom scene.  The movie in no way portrays this as a real turning point as it was in the books.  Likewise, Malfoy is underdeveloped as Potter's rival - in the movie he just smirks a lot. Finally, so many critical side characters were left out.  Fred and George hardly appear which is a horrible loss given the great comic relief they could have provided.  Peeves is absent altogether.<br/><br/>Harry Potter was played with diffidence by a clearly out-of-his-league Daniel Radcliffe.  Neither Grint nor Watson helped out the cause, acting wise - both overacting in a very community theatre manner.  Therein lies the real problem, the movie is driven by kids, but they seem to have cast them based on resemblance to the book characters, not acting ability.<br/><br/>The positives are most of the adult roles, especially Alan Rickman as Severus Snape and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, who pretty much owns the film.<br/><br/>
The effects are pretty nice, including a good Quidditch match.  However, the movie could have cut both the Hagrid and Norbert story arc and the whole trip to the Forbidden Forest, taken the extra budget and had the other critical Quidditch match - making for a far stronger movie, plot wise.<br/><br/>Fun to watch, but hardly amazing.  6/10"
"jhaggardjr","10","0","0","18 November 2001"," Magical masterpiece
","Here is the magical surprise of 2001. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the best movie that I've seen all year (so far). This I totally did not expect. This is a film that works not only on the level of special effects. It has a terrific story, wonderful characters, and a beautiful atmosphere. This was quite refreshing since so many of the movies today that feature special effects are weak on story and characterization. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the first movie in what is going to be a big movie series based on ""Harry Potter"" novels written by J.K. Rowling. So far four novels have been written with three more on the way. This movie has created so much hype that the second movie is already in the works. I think this is going to be a blockbuster franchise. The movie opens with the title character living with relatives that are cruel and heartless. Then Harry gets a letter from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and learns that he's a wizard. So he gets away from his despicable uncle, aunt, and cousin, and journeys to this special school to learn the tricks of his trade. Along the way he meets two young aspiring magicians who will become his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. He also makes an enemy in Draco Malfoy, who is kind of like the evil version of Harry. The faculty of Hogwarts include wise headmaster Albus Dumbledore; huge groundskeeper Hagrid; Prof. McGonagall, who can transform into a cat and back to human form in a flash; Prof. Snape, who's sinister looks create fear in the students; Prof. Hooch, the broomstick instructor; and Prof. Quirrell, who wears what looks like a turban all the time and studders alot. There are alot of visual elements that work wonderfully in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". My favorite scene is the one where the students play the game of Quidditch. That is a fascinating special effects sequence that is kind of hard to describe but is fulfilling to watch. It kind of reminded me of the pod race in ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" with its effects going across the screen at a rapid pace. Another great scene in the movie is the one where the three kids play an unusual high stakes game of chess, where the huge game pieces come to life. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" works on every level. In addition to the excellent special effects, it works on the direction and screenplay. The director here is Chris Columbus, who's worked in this territory before as the director of the popular kids- oriented 1990 comedy ""Home Alone"" and its first sequel, 1992's ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"". He worked with kids again in the little more adult oriented 1993 Robin Williams blockbuster ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". These three hit movies directed by Columbus were more lighthearted in its tone, but Columbus has been in more darker territory before. His directorial debut came with ""Adventures in Babysitting"", the black comedy from 1987 that was filmed in Chicago and starred Elisabeth Shue. Before stepping into the director's chair, Columbus wrote a couple of screenplay's for a trio of Steven Spielberg productions: ""Gremlins"", ""The Goonies"", and ""Young Sherlock Holmes"". ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" bares a resemblance to each one of those movies in some way. Those virtuoso special effects scenes when those big chess pieces comes to life was very much like some of the special effects scenes in ""Young Sherlock Holmes"". This movie is like an ""Indiana Jones"" for kids; so was ""The Goonies"". This movie is scary and darker in tone; so was ""Gremlins"". Though unlike ""Gremlins"", ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" isn't violent. It's scary, but not over-the-line scary. Columbus was a good choice as director of this movie (Steven Spielberg had a chance to direct this, but passed on it to make ""A.I.""), and it's his best film as director to date. He's brought this movie to life in exhilarating fashion. The screenplay is by Oscar nominee Steve Kloves (""Wonder Boys""), who did a superb job in adapting the movie from the book. The cinematography, editing, production design, and costume design are all first-rate and deserve Oscar attention, along with the visual effects. The performances are picture perfect. The three kids who play Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all acting newcomers and they were all perfect choices to play these characters. I think we'll be seeing alot of Daniel Radcliffe in the future. Radcliffe portrays Harry Potter to absolute perfection. He holds the movie together in every scene, and was a natural choice to play this character. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are very exceptional as Ron and Hermione. Like Radcliffe, we'll be seeing alot of Grint and Watson for years to come. They're all terrific young British actors (and they've all been signed on to star in the next ""Harry Potter"" movie). You couldn't have asked for a better supporting cast than the one that's featured in this movie, all a who's who of veteran British actors. Richard Harris (as headmaster Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape), Robbie Coltrane (groudskeeper Hagrid), Zoe Wanamaker (Prof. Hooch), and Ian Hart (Prof. Quirrell) are all perfectly cast; with John Cleese, Warwick Davis, Richard Griffiths, John Hurt, Fiona Shaw, and Julie Walters featured in smaller roles. What a cast! I loved everything about ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". This is not just a movie for kids, but for the whole family. I've never read any of the ""Harry Potter"" books, but on the basis of this first ""Harry Potter"" movie, I think I'm going to go out and purchase the books. Or maybe ask to receive them as a Christmas gift. Speaking of Christmas, I think ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" will be the smash hit of the Christmas season 2001. If it doesn't surpass last year's Christmas hit, ""Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" (which opened at exactly the same time a year ago), then the American moviegoing public has completely lost it. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" has gotten far better reviews that ""The Grinch"" movie did last year, and critically acclaimed movies deserve to be blockbuster hits alot more than critically hated movies like ""The Grinch"". From what I saw this weekend (a packed moviehouse and an opening day gross of $29.5 million), ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" will be a blockbuster smash. BET ON IT!!!!!<br/><br/>**** (out of four)"

","I'm sorry Harry Potter fans, but this movie was disappointing like no other I had seen before.<br/><br/>I appreciate all movies, especially the ones that can keep you thinking even after the movie is over. I like the ones that can pull you in and keep you there. And even better, when they can do it without extra added frills like special effects.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that is just plain terrible. I believe it would be just as disappointing to children, even the Harry Potter fans. The only worthwhile part of this movie was the use of special effects, such as recreating the actors and actresses with 3D graphics in order to better make them fit with the other computer generated things, such as riding around on the broomsticks. While this is impressive, they also used WAY too many techniques from early movies, such as... well, forget I said technique. I mean cheap methods... such as 90% of the shots of Harry on the broomstick just from the shoulders up. It makes it obscenely fake looking, and I really think they could've done a better job. You can tell they were in a hurry to make some money... especially since the sequel is already listed on IMDB for 2002! Give me a break. Expect more cheap effects.<br/><br/>Terrible too is the way they delay everything. The only reason the movie is two and a half hours long is because every time something stupid happens, they put the camera on Harry's face for about 5 minutes so you can see his extreme expressions of surprise. Hello? Anyone remember Home Alone? The cute facial expressions thing has been done before. Let's not lengthen a movie by an hour because he's... ahem... cute?<br/><br/>Last, but CERTAINLY not least, is the director's usage of random BS. I love it when movies keep you guessing about what's going to happen next, but I don't like it when the reason you can't guess is because it's completely RANDOM. Everything happens in a sequence, one thing after another, and never dwells on anything from earlier in the movie. Nothing is said or done early on in the movie that makes you say, ""Woah, clever."" when you near the end. You might say, ""Oh, but the viewer's are kids."" That's funny. I went and saw it the second day it was out in theatre's, and didn't see a SINGLE LITTLE KID. Not ONE. I'm sure the adults that were there wouldn't tell anyone else to take their kids to see this movie. For the money they spend on taking their kids, they could get them something they would enjoy, like Harry Potter action figures, or even another one of the books in the series. Maybe liven up their brains a bit with some more intellectual reading.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the movie does have a few good parts. I won't be a complete jerk about it. If you have not yet seen this movie, stay on the lookout for the chessboard, the troll, and ""Fluffy"". These kind of kept the movie interesting. A low, dull sort of interesting, but the only excitement you will find.<br/><br/>Sorry again to all the Harry Potter fans. I was expecting better myself."

","Harry Potter was a fun movie, especially if you have children who are enchated by these stories.  But taking it on it's own as just a movie, without any pre-read book bias, it is a mediocre movie.<br/><br/>Now, I must preface this by saying, I have not read the books, so I have not had the chance to come under J.K. Rowling's spell.  But when you watch the movie, it feels like you are reading a book and each scene is only a chapter without a flow to the story line.  Each little adventure does not seem to really advance the story. It was a fun movie though with your usual special effects although there was nothing ground breaking.  The Quidditch/Broomstick scenes made use of CG humans which I thought was particularly unconvincing Overall fun, but make sure you bring a kid/adult who enjoys Mr. Potter so you can revel in the public hysteria that is Hogwart's."

","HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE delivers. Thank Warners for that.<br/><br/>That's the important part. All there is left to do is praise the sumptious craft and thank the writer for taking an ingeniously wrought plot and divining it on to the screen with a minimum of Hollywoodisation.<br/><br/>It's curious that the least satisfying creative element of the film is by a man who has defined Hollywood in the minds of the world, composer John Williams. His score is uninspired and strangely out of date, playing like a selection of cues that might not have made it into RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Aside from the chess match no one cue stands proud and the main theme doesn't suit Harry because even though he's an 11 year old, he has depth and a history.<br/><br/>But HARRY POTTER is a children's film based on a children's book so there is precious little subtext to justify repeated visits to the film. Images of hundreds of owls trying to deliver Harry the acceptance letter from Hogwarts are delightful and the film charms its way along to the finale which still manages to surprise despite this reviewer having read the book several times.<br/><br/>If I had to carp it would be the preponderance of digital effects. Three headed dogs and trolls - acceptable selections for CGI but the craft of computer generated imagery has not reached the stage of portraying realistic human performers and we get a digital Harry quite a few times flying at breakneck speed on his Nimbus 2000. It may be my point of view - being all too aware of digital effects - but these tricks didn't detract too much though there were a few Quidditch moves that looked more like SHREK than flesh and blood.<br/><br/>Enough. There is no real trouble with HARRY so a nod of appreciated to Columbus, Kloves and Warners not to mention the person who oversaw production like, well, like an owl. Joanna Kathleen Rowling.

I couldn't believe that halfway through the movie I was getting bored.  How could that be because I've waited ages to see this movie and I knew what to expect having read the book.  That's however where the problem lied.  I'd seen it all before, but in my head.  The movie was so true to the book you felt you were watching a movie you'd already seen before and that killed the surprise value in it.<br/><br/>The casting was good especially the young Emma Watson who steals the show, in my opinion, who plays Hermione.  She looks as though she's one to look out for in the future.<br/><br/>If you've never read the book then the film will offer a lot of excitement despite the time constraints the film had.

"Pagz","7","0","0","18 November 2001"," Great book, Good movie, poor editing
","Being a fan of the Harry Potter series, I was of course very interested in seeing the adaptation of ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone"". Having now seen the film, I'm left with mixed feelings.<br/><br/>I hadn't read the book in just over a year, so I came to this movie with as much of a blank slate as someone who has read the book can. I was familiar with the characters, knew the basics of the story, but had forgotten most of the important specifics. This is the way I wanted it. I wanted to rediscover things via the movie and then be able to say ""Oh Yeah, they sure did nail that"". Unfortunately, there were all too few moments like that for me.<br/><br/>The adaptation, to say the very least, is exceptionally accurate. Very few novels have had such spot on adaptations made. Accuracy however does not a great movie make. The movie is good, but suffers from some of the worst editing I've ever encountered in a big budget motion picture. This is truly painful for me to say, because the man who edited this film, Richard Francis-Bruce, also edited some of my all time favourite films, including ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Seven"" and ""The Green Mile"". For some reason though, he has completely failed with Harry Potter. The movie's scenes are cobbled together in a very stilted, halting manner.<br/><br/>RFB seems to have forgotten the cinematic language of editing in this film. Cuts denote little to no time passing, fades and dissolves denote the larger passage of time. In this film, We will cut from a scene of Harry in the kitchen, to another scene of harry in the kitchen which is supposed to take place several days later. The cut facilitating this however is so abrupt that if you haven't read the book, you will find yourself momentarily confused as you try to sort out where in the flow of the story this new scene is supposed to be. This kind of editing is prevalent throughout the movie. The film is in dire need of some transitional scenes and montage sequences in order to really give the sense of the passage of time.<br/><br/>In spite of the lack-luster editing, the movie never feels slow or overlong, and clocking in at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I was surprised to find that I felt no more than 90 minutes could have possibly elapsed. I would have gladly sat in that theatre for another half hour or more, which would have been to the benefit of the film, allowing them to flesh out many of the things that are sorely missed. The ending, to those who haven't read the books, is going to feel clichÃ©d and tacked on. An extra half hour, to flesh out the Dursley's, show more of the unfair point deductions from Gryffindor (thanks to one Prof. Snape) and to allow for some transitional montage scenes showing Harry and the gang in their various classes doing various magic things, would have helped the film out immensely. As it stands, you never really get the sense that Harry attends any classes at Hogwarts, as they are shown so briefly as to be quickly forgotten.<br/><br/>Supposedly, the original rough-cut of the film was just over 3 hours long, and I very much hope that this cut makes it to DVD in the form of a directors cut, as any additional fleshing out of this movie can only be to its benefit.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Harry Potter is a solid film, never feels as long as it actually is, and is a very accurate adaptation, but for all of that, there are definitely some major problems that could have been easily solved with better editing an additional scenes."

","Some of the scenes in this movie was INCREDIBLE.  I was not expecting the quidditch match to look so amazing.  The special effects could have carried this movie alone.<br/><br/>However, i found some fault in the acting, namely the boy who played harry. Don't get me wrong, he looked the part and all (with the exception of his eye color), but his acting was a little stiff, and didn't get better until the last 30 minutes.  Also, they introduced all of the characters into the book, but did not go into depth about most of them.  Neville was on for a good 5 minutes total, so people who haven't read the book might be a little confused. And personally, the dursleys didn't seem so bad.  Professer McGonagell came off as cruel and cold-hearted, and they didn't mention her being the head of griffandor.<br/><br/>The movie was LONG.  Go to the bathroom beforehand.  They put in the most important scenes, but the transition was choppy and a bit confusing.<br/><br/>But some people were worth watching.  John Cleese as Nearly-Headless-Nick was great, even if it was a brief cameo role.  So was the boy who played Ron, and he got most of the laughs in my theater.  Hagrid was exactly as i imangined, and he was wonderful.<br/><br/>All in all, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was good, just had a view faults.  If you don't want to go for the plot, or the charachters, go to see the amazing special effects, like invisability, moving pictures, and an MC Escher-type hogwarts."

","(Spoiler alert)<br/><br/>I've read the books and was really rather looking forward to the film. Practically every casting that was announced made us all go ""Yes! Yes! that's just right"", particularly Alan Rickman as Snape and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. The trailers looked good, the music sounded just right and everything. All the reviews we had seen praised it to high heavens.<br/><br/>And boy, did it look good. It oozed production values out of every pore, the acting was, by and large, superb (though I wasn't actually that impressed with Harry himself, who came across a little bland - like a spectator) and it remained largely faithful to the book in that they didn't alter stuff too much.<br/><br/>What they *did* do is cut it to shreds. Now, I can understand that this is a film primarily aimed at kids, and a 4 and a half hour film is going to be waaaay too long. We sat between two families and the kids were fidgeting an d getting bored half an hour in.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, what we end up with is Harry Potter's Greatest Hits:<br/><br/>
We zoom through the introductory stuff, whizz through Diagon Alley, a quick train journey and we're there.<br/><br/>Oops. We're supposed to have met Draco Malfoy twice by now. Better introduce him now before the sorting.<br/><br/>Can't be sorting everyone, just do the major characters and move along.<br/><br/>Broom lesson - Harry's good - Quidditch - and off we go to the next big set-piece scene.<br/><br/>You get the general picture.<br/><br/>Mostly, it's fairly seamless although occasionally there are times when a plot point was removed that gives our characters a reason to do something. In the book, we find ourselves in the forbidden corridor after Draco challenges Harry to a duel, sends Filch instead and they run, first from Filch then from Peeves (Rik Mayall, sadly cut) and find themselves in front of a locked door, the other side of which is Fluffy.<br/><br/>In the film, they just wander up there. OK, yes, the staircase moves so they can't get where they *were* going, but there's no particular reason for them to say ""oh well, we'll go this way instead"".<br/><br/>The main thing that the film ends up missing out, however, is characterisations. We hardly see anyone except the three heroes and I've heard a lot of people saying ""X was good. Pity s/he didn't have much screen time."" Even Draco Malfoy, bane of Harry's life, and the supposedly-evil Professor Snape get to do little more than sneer at Harry occasionally, just to show us that they're the ""bad guys"".<br/><br/>Someone complained in another review here that everyone was so darned Anglo-Saxon. Of course, we never actually got to meet the Patil twins or Ravenclaw seeker Cho Chang, and dreadlocked Lee Jordan is relegated to being a Quidditch commentator and general extra. Another casualty of the need to get the time down.<br/><br/>Like I say, I can understand why it was done, it just left me feeling like I'd eaten a cream puff. Tasted nice, but you're still hungry afterwards."

","I'm sorry for anyone who like the movie but it was totally different from the book. Yeah,  most of the dialuoge is the same but it skips important parts in the book (ex..the SECOND Quidditch match, yes there is suppose to be two quidditch matches for those who haven't read the book, and the last chamber before he goes and gets the stone, it was suppose to be Professor Snape's challenge.) If it wasn't for the main characters that were still in it, you might have thought you weren't in the right movie. They also left a character out that is mentioned once in every other chapter. Peeves the Poltergeist. How could they forget PEEVES!!! well, this is my opinion. If you haven't read the book, you might enjoy it, but if you have, you might possibly not."

"risawn","7","0","0","17 November 2001"," A great film adaptation but. . .
","For starters, i am a huge Harry Potter fan. Not because it's a craze right now or because everyone else is reading it, but because I read the books and have grown a love for them, for the amazing story lines and intricate plot points. And the characters are all three dimensional and well written, and you can't help but feel for them. JK Rowling has put a lot of time and planning into this little baby of hers, and it shows.<br/><br/>Hence, I've been waiting for this movie to come out ever since I first heard about it. I have avoided movie reviews and all other such nonsense as much as possible so I could have my own unbiased opinion of a movie that is based on books I love so much.<br/><br/>Well, one of my favorite parts was the Monster's Inc trailer directly before it. This Trailer alone is worth the price of admission! But enough of that, on to the movie.<br/><br/>Well, Being the enormous Potter fan that I am, my main concern was for it to stay true to the books. So I will start with the good things about the movie first.<br/><br/>All of the characters were perfectly cast. The girl who played Hermione was exactly how I pictured her to be, and did a dead on performance. The special effects were amazing, and I have become especially impressed with how far technology has come in the last few years. The story line also contained most of the key events in the novel and was almost entirely true to it. It is one of the best film adaptations to a book I have ever seen, and I must say that I did enjoy it.<br/><br/>However, I must admit that this movie has its weaknesses. And it is not the fault of the movie, its director, or its actors. The fault in the movie lies in the fact that it is based on a book that has a very large and loyal fan base, many of which have read this book more then once, and know it cover to cover.<br/><br/>This movie clocked in at nearly 2 and a half hours and it still seemed entirely too short. The book is so complex, in that it and all the books following are all interconnected, and there is fore shadowing in every one. All of these events seem important, whether in character development or in relation to the current or future plots. There are so many secondary characters in this book that they aren't given nearly enough screen time. (the Dursley's for instance, one small example.  Fred and George Weasley, another. These two are a couple of my favorite characters and we didn't see nearly enough of them!) I felt that we weren't given quite a clear glimpse of Snape's absolute loathing of Harry Potter, or why he was helping Harry if he hated him so much. This is important to the character of Snape. And this kind of stuff seemed to happen entirely to often.<br/><br/>That has to be my main concern, however. Because I've read these books and know them so well, I can all to clearly point out things that are missing from the original book, and even though I was enjoying myself, this kept plaguing on my mind and somewhat distracted me. Because I have read this book, I know certain facts that it was necessary to leave out due to length of the film was already at monstrous proportions.  And I noticed that they were missing.<br/><br/>Which leads me to the next fault of the movie. Because it wanted to stay so true to the books, so much information needed to be included into the movie, and I got the impression that the movie was slightly rushed. The transition from one time period to the next, as this book takes place over the course of a school year, makes it need far more time to go through that.<br/><br/>Alright, overall, I give this 3 out of 4 stars, as it was a noble effort on behalf of the production team to bring this movie to life, and although I sound like I'm nit-picking the movie, I was impressed, as I think they did the best they could with the material. However, before watching it yourself, I would recommend picking up the first book if you haven't already (as most of you should have by now). This movie is a companion piece to the far superior book that it is based upon, and I wouldn't see it as anything other then that.  If you see this movie without at some point reading the book, you are missing out greatly.<br/><br/>Well, this book is also the shortest in the series so far, which has me thinking. I have such a vivid imagination of the other three books and characters, do I need a movie to describe events in the book when I prefer the book to a director's version of it? And if I was distracted by missing information in the portrayal of the first one, do I need to even bother watching any future renditions?<br/><br/>Oh well, I'll probably watch the future ones anyway. I'll just know what to expect and expect to have a good time!"

","It has been stated in many different publications that because of time and WB's heavy hand a good 25% of the movie had to be cut that was filmed.  I feel since there was over 4 hours of film, and having to cut it down to 2 and 1/2 hrs the film was very good, I can not give it a 10 (until the DVD comes out, maybe then I can change my vote to a 10 from a 9) I do feel some very important scenes were left out, but after I see the DVD I will be happy.  I just feel that hopefully when the DVD comes out all of the scenes with be there.  In the different publications, it has been stated that the DVD will have all that was filmed.  There were a few things that upset me that weren't in the film, but not enough to make me tell people not to go see the film. All of the actors were wonderful and the casting was perfect.  I have read each of the books 2 or 3 times and I am not a 8 yr old, (I am 26, no kids) and I hoping that if we the fans make enough noise, maybe we can force WB's to do what they need to do, make a 4 hr or longer film with an intermission, movies use to have them, so why can't we have them again.  If you don't want to anger your true fans (the kids) you will understand that the film needs to have everything, not just the high points. One last thing, where was the Sorting Hat's song?  Will it be in the DVD? Great film, left a bit too much out, but still beautiful and a wonderful way to forget about today's problems (for 2 & 1/2 hrs)! I plan on seeing it again next weekend."

","I think I can sum it all up in one word: WICKED!<br/><br/>And those of you who have been following all the hype surrounding this movie know exactly what I am talking about.  Those who have not, will just have to do their homework.<br/><br/>I usually do not frequent movies in which I have read the book.  I broke this rule most recently when I went to see one of John Grishams books come alive on the big screen.  Besides the plot of the movie having the same as the book it was hard to come away thinking they were one in the same. Needless to say, I have not been back to see any movie of a novel I have read since.<br/><br/>I really had no intention of seeing this movie at first.  I wanted to keep my imagination alive with all the vivid images and scenes that I had painted in my head while reading the first four books J.K. Rowling has shaped. This world she has created is rich with larger than life characters and scenes that would leave even Tolkien die hard fan's in awe.<br/><br/>Against even bone in my body saying no to going to see the movie when it came out on the big screen, the one thing that put me in the sit was my six year old son who wanted nothing else more than to see Harry Potter.  He even got dressed up as Mr. Potter in the robes equipped with his Glasses and signature forehead scar.<br/><br/>I heard somewhere the production crew ended up with almost more than four hours of movie when it was all said and done.  If Chris Columbus where to re-release the movie at Christmas time adding the scenes back into the movie making it a four and half hour flick, I would be the first in line to see it on the big screen.<br/><br/>Outside of the special effects and spectacular backgrounds, you could almost follow this movie chapter by chapter with a book in your lap.  It was as if they took every scene directly right out of my memory and displayed it on the screen.<br/><br/>The cast members were larger than life, just as they characters in the book that they portray.  I almost felt as if I had been transported to The Hogwarts School of Witch Craft and Wizardry to watch some extra ordinary unfold before my senses.<br/><br/>Hats off to Director Chris Columbus and the Producers for recognizing the need to produce these movies in an orderly manner.  I mean, let's face it, two ro three years from now, Danny will not really be a boy anymore and they would have lost there charm by trying to replace a cast this well put together.<br/><br/>This was much more than eye candy and I can not wait to see how they are all doing next term when the Chamber of Secrets is opened after fifty years of silence."

","I saw the film last night and can say that this movie will be bigger than anything we expected.  I am a 21 year old college student who has read the books multiple times and enjoys arguing with people who say these books are just for children.  The books were awesome and I must say that the movie does not disappoint.  The key to whether or not these movies would be good was if the director stuck to the books.  He did.  And the result is the most visually impressive, magical 2.5 hours of film in a long time.  The sets are absolutely amazing and the detail of the backgrounds (the moving pictures and such) are perfect.  The kids are all great (in particular, Ron and Neville were awesome), but Snape is hands-down the best cast.  My only complaint (and the reason the film did not receive a 10 from me) was some of the omissions that the director did decide to do.  Of course the director can't put in everything, but I felt that some elements that the book had would have made the story stronger.  The most glaring omission (in my humble opinion) was eliminating the meeting of Harry and Draco in Diagon Alley. In the book, that scene sets the tone for their relationship far better than the non-subtle way in which the movie does it.  Also, there is simply a feeling of anticipation that the book broadcasts; the movie can't compete. But the movie succeeds in its intentions.  The world of Harry Potter exists in more than just our imaginations now."

","After reading all of J.K Rowling's excellent Harry Potter books, I was a little unsure about what to expect from the film. It is so very hard to convey the essence and vitality of a book to the big screen. Little did I know that I was in for a massive and rather pleasent surprise.<br/><br/>The splendour of the locations as described in the book were translated so very well to the movie - one could not help but be astounded by Hogwarts, it's grounds and the Forbidden Forest. The use of CGI in the film was well balanced, effective and warranted.<br/><br/>But of course, 'smoke and mirrors' can only do so much to enhance a film. The 'magic' truly comes from the actors and actresses who portray those so vital roles. The casting staff need to be given full credit; I cannot think of any one more suited to the roles than those who were cast for them. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were absolutely spectacular, words are insufficient to lavish the amount of praise upon them that is necessary to convey my feelings. Harry, Ron and Hermione leapt from the book and onto the screen in their form. Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltraine, Richard Harris and Alan Rickman must be praised for their portrayal of the Hogwarts Faculty, each as stunning as each other, the spirit of the book must have truly flowed throughout the film set during Filming.<br/><br/>My only critique if any was that there were not enough scenes with the Aforementioned faculty. However, Daniel, Rupert and Emma certainly shone with such a light that it was only after I had thought about the film in retrospect that I developed this 'critique'.<br/><br/>A whole hearted 10 out of 10 goes to this film, and deservedly so."

It's Harry Potter!<br/><br/>This is the first movie I've seen lately where the special effects are used to tell the story instead of being the story. Even though there was a lot of CG in the movie, it was completely transparent. You believe that they are flying on brooms. The quiddich match looked extremely real.<br/><br/>If certain details are missing, like the ghosts, well, they just didn't have time. The movie runs very long as it is, and still there was very little fat to be trimmed. Poor John Cleese, his character had gobs of humor for him to mine... but it was a time thing.<br/><br/>I would say that everyone could benefit from seeing this movie, and if you haven't read the books you may have an advantage.

","When I first heard of Harry Potter catching on, I believed it to be a fad and grouped it with Pokemon and that ilk of marketing genius. When, however, I stayed with an associate and could not sleep, I was handed the book and told to read it and see for myself. I did and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The film captures the book well enough and deserves a lot of the same merit. It seems like the actors were grown for the adaption of the book and they were very easily believable. This film may be family fare, but it is also a lot of fun to watch. Its plotline may not be Shakespeare, but its better than 90% of all thats out there and if you were at all excited about the pod race in Star Wars: A Phantom Menace, then the Quidditch scenes in this film are made for you. To be honest, this film did, for me, what Star Wars: A New Hope did and what I had hoped Star Wars: Phantom Menace could do, it made me believe in something fictional and applicable to my real life. To be honest, Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter aren't too far apart, both are the underdog, trapped children of circumstance beyond their control who achieve great deeds and still remain fresh faced and likeable. The reason Rowling's magic may be more likely to last in sequels than Lucas' did in prequels is because there is a certain heart in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone missing from Phantom Menace. Rowling did what Lucas once did, she makes us believe in the Power of the Heart and Columbus, through casting and great effects, captures what Rowling did with text in vibrant, sometimes over the edge cinematography and graphics that never become too much, but never leave much to be desired. Casting was flawless right down to the never fallible John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick. Once, Superman made us believe that a man could fly. Star Wars showed us the magic all around us. Now, Harry Potter shows us the magic within ourselves and lets our spirits fly. A true joy to watch and well worth a second or third look at least."

","I'm 22 and started reading the books last year at 21. The first three books I finished each in one day respectively. The fourth took me two days, as I do go to college and do have to do work at times. Now I'm a fast reader by nature, but these really kept me enthralled. I remembered almost every detail afterwards they were so good.<br/><br/>I went to see this on Saturday with my Mom and little sister. My mom not having read the books probably liked it the most for it's cute appeal. Obviously, they had to leave certain parts out and condense others, or this would have been an 8-hour movie as one said. While I enjoy long movies and miniseries, I can understand how kids would get fidgety. But they should have made better decisions on what to keep and what to cut.<br/><br/>Peeves was a disappointing miss. The whole dragon adventure with the whole smuggling bit would have been great to see. I was rather looking forward to it. Since when did Hermione fix Harry's glasses? Last I knew he had them with the tape through the four books. What was up with Madame Hooch's eyes? I thought she was supposed to be normal looking.<br/><br/>The characters definitely weren't developed enough like another person commented. I love Alan Rickman, but he was definitely subdued. He even seemed to smile at Harry in an almost gentle way at times. NO!!! He hates Harry, remember?<br/><br/>I can understand condensing the train ride, but to keep the whole dragon theme, they didn't need the part about Harry letting Hedwig out around the grounds for the panoramic views. That wasted a bit of time.<br/><br/>Again, there definitely needed to be more of a connection between all the characters to get us to understand and feel for them more. We also missed out on friendships with Neville, Seamus, and Lee. There also was not enough of Draco and his gang. They do play a fair size part in the stories. They never even played up on the whole fear of Voldemort. People freak when Harry says his name. In the film, even Hermione was using it casually.<br/><br/>Someone also complained that the children actors talked with too many pauses. I think that will go away with time. They are new to acting, and need to be tweaked. I can definitely say though, the Quidditch match was really cool. It was also cool that they had the paintings move in the background, even when they weren't being brought to people's attentions. As I said before, it was good, but it needs work."

","The most eagerly awaited movie of the year is finally here, and it was sure worth waiting for. <br/><br/>It has all the elements of a blockbuster. The child stars for the younger audience to identify with, the adult jokes to keep the older ones interested and enough twists and plot developments to keep everyone on the edge of their seats. <br/><br/>The cast are all perfect for the roles they're in. Richard Harris as headmaster, Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Alan Rickman as Harry's most hated teacher, Snape. The child stars are great too. There's been a lot of bad write ups about them, and how they don't cut it, but as child stars go, they're not so bad. I thought they were rather good. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson playing Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively, do a great job of convincing the audience that they're newbie wizards and witches. Watson particulary shines as the pretentious Hermione, but Grint does a bang up job playing the sarcastic Ron. <br/><br/>Chris Columbus has done a wonderful job of putting J.K Rowling's story onscreen with Steve Kloves adapting the script to it's full potential. Sure, some scenes have been left out or changed slightly, but it doesn't affect the main plot. I'm sure die hard fans would try and complain, but they'd have a hard job picking bad points. I'm a fan myself and I was most impressed, especially since although it's mainly an American movie, the cast are all British, which makes a change, in this case, a welcome one.<br/><br/>The use of cgi wasn't over used, as one IMDb user said. It was used only when needed, and used to it's full effect. The mountain troll, the quidditch match, the dining hall and the final showdown all had it and made the movie what it was. The quidditch match is by far the best scene. The moving camera follows the speeding broomsticks and quaffles with the sounds coming from in front, behind and at the sides (when watched in cinemas with surround sound) make the whole scene a feel as if you're up there on a broomstick with the team. <br/><br/>This movie appeals to both children and adults alike and is a film that can be watched several times without getting dull. Go see this movie as soon as you can. The cast alone make the movie worth seeing, the effects just make it better. <br/><br/>A classic that'll still be watched in years to come."

","This is one of the greatest movies I've seen this year, if not the best I've seen this year. It's a great adaption from the book, which was outstanding also. The movie had a great character developement, as well it had great special effects, plot, acting, and everything else you look for in a movie. The movie does live up to it's hype, which is unusual in the movie industry for the last quite a few years. Much to most of your people's and critics' dismay, I liked Pearl Harbor. So for me, Pearl Harbor also lived up to it's hype. But lets get to the Harry Potter issue. Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry was fantastic, along with his two best friends Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grinn). <br/><br/> After reading other people's negative comments, (don't get me wrong, most of them were positive) they said it wasn't good because they left too much out from the book. Let's think about it here, shall we? Movies are suppose to be different from the book. It's been said a million times, NOT metaphorically speaking. Yes, the book is better, but just a tad better. I have to say this is the best adaption from book to movie since Jurassic Park. But for Jurassic Park, I'm currently reading the book which I'm enjoying thoroughly, although I actually like the movie a little more, so far. But if you haven't read the book of Harry Potter, read it, because it's one of the best books I ever read. My favorite book ever would have to be it's second outstanding sequel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. So when you get the chance read the series of Harry Potter and read them in miracle order, otherwise you won't like them most likely.<br/><br/> The plot is the same from the book, so just figure that out for yourself. I also read a comment by a person who hated the movie. They said they didn't read the book before either. Once again, I say this. The book is different from the movie! When you get a chance to see this movie, see it. But read the book first. I hope you love the movie just as I did, because Chris Columbus did a fantastic job. Chris Columbus knew what he was doing when he took the job to do this phenonema. So one thing to tell you Chris, bring on #3 and #4. The first Harry gets a 10/10. Expect to here from me again after Chamber of Secrets, because my expectations are high. I also forgot to mention, that the quidditch scene and wizard's chess is awesome."

","It is a poorer world without books. When I went to see 'HPATPS' none 0f my family had read more than a few pages of any of JK Rowling's books. I had tried in vain to persuade my two children to become interested in reading. So, I thought, the film may do the trick, and it may just have done that. They are actually threatening to READ it now. Phew! I may even have a go myself. I suspected that the four of us were in a minority in the cinema, not knowing hardly anything about the story. The hype suggested that those 'not in the know' would struggle to follow the opening 30 minutes. I have to report that this warning was superfluos as we all seemed to know exactly what was happening! The money was obviously well spent, and, although I am not a lover of computer effects, they were handled sensitively and sensibly.Dare I suggest that the story did seem to slightly drag in the middle somewhere, but it was always entertaining, because of the fact that everything was wonderful to look at. The fine cast were great, although I kept expecting Alan Rickman to 'let rip', until the end, when I realised why he hadn't! It is the three children, however, who outshone Britain's Best. All 3 are magnificent in their roles, especially Emma Watson, who stole the film for me. My thanks to the director, who, if this film does prompt my children to read, will have, like his namesake, have proved that the world really is round, and not square. Another good thing to come from this film is that the '12' certificate is completely unnecessary. If Harry Potter gets a 'PG' then I can't think of another '12' film I've seen which does not deserve likewise. This was scary at times. Good for the censors, but they really should assess all films consistently."
"bru0017","8","0","0","18 November 2001"," Good, but not great. Certainly not a classic.
","I am 19 years old, and have read the first two books in the Harry Potter series. The books are great and I can understand all the hype. I was looking forward to this movie, but seeing the trailer gave me the impression it wouldn't be great. In watching the movie two nights ago at the staff preview and again last night I just thought the movie felt too rushed. It tried to include everything in Rowling's book which didn't capture all the plots in the story and in fact ruined some. The movie lost lots of the humor and emotion found in the book. Also, my friends who hadn't read the books were confused in a few parts since the plot had holes. They didn't even see Potter as being this great wizard. The movie was definitely written for people who had read the books. I would give this movie 2 1/2 stars out of 4. On a further note, being a young adult/late teenager, I can understand the appeal this movie will have to children 12 and under. They will want to go see it many times, I won't go again. One thing that bothers me about this movie is that it is the current fad, and for deserving reasons, the books are great, however, just like the latest Britney Spears cd, everyone will be running to the theaters to buy their ticket. I realize this movie will probably break the $400 million mark due to repeat viewings by younger children and their parents. Good for Potter, but it saddens me that this movie will do better in the box office than the Lord of the Rings. This bothers me for the Lord of the Rings will be a better movie but I do not think will make as much money due to all the repeat viewings of children and their parents. Both movies are worth seeing. But let's not pretend that Harry Potter is a classic when it's not."

","This is a one of a kind movie that will not be forgotten for a long time to come. Harry Potter is played by Daniel Radcliffe, witch is the ultimate Harry. No sole on earth could have acted as well as he did. Hermonie was a well chosen actor. As for Ron, His personality matched his part, but he was suppose to have freckles. But in the movie he did not.

"NoContende","Null","0","0","17 November 2001"," Magic...but at what Cost?
","When a book, especially a magical hit like Harry Potter, is transformed into a movie there is bound to be few kinks.  Most of the time, the kinks lie in the script.  What do you cut and what do you leave in?  Most book to movie adaptations follow a simple rule. <br/><br/>There is no way you can make the entire book into a screenplay, you would end up with a 8 hour film.  So you cut plot points and lesser story lines and concentrate on the main theme.  Now Harry Potter took the other route.  They made the entire book into a movie and pared it down to two and a half hours.  And the movie suffered. <br/><br/>Instead of concentrating on main points (mythology, relationships, character development, etc.) and making them solid, they touched upon every little aspect only slightly.  The result was a rushed movie with no pay off.  They left scenes in that, had nothing to do with the story or plot and cut scenes that should build relationships and background so we care about the characters.  I was crushed when I read that Ron had to sacrifice himself for the others, in the movie, with no emotional tie to Ron I thought ""That's too bad.""  That's not the writing, but the direction.  For example, they left a 5 minuet scene in about Norbert, Hargrid's Dragon.  It had nothing to do with the over all story...it was so rushed it didn't even explain the strange obsession Hagrid has with Magical Creatures.  The scene stayed in, but a 2nd and 3rd Quidditch match was cut.  It appeared to this hopeful movie patron that the powers that be (Chris Columbus and crew) made an 8 hour movie.  Then cut it down to make the fans of the book happy.  But the result is a rushed story where we don't see the wonderful relationship of Ron, Harry and Hermione.  A story where we don't see the relationship with Hagrid and the 3 students.  A story where we learn in the last 20 minuets that ""You Know Who"" only fears Dumbledore (McGonagall , played wonderfully by Maggie Smith, explains it in one line and then moves on)   A story where I was not afraid of the villain or what he could do.  Everything that makes Harry Potter, Harry Potter was gone.  I would have loved to have seen the fatherly admiration and duty Dumbledore has for Harry.  I would love to have seen the previous visits to Hagrid's cottage.  I would have loved to have seen Harry and Ron go through the stress of school.  I would have loved to have seen the small sections in the book that made Harry Potter a magical reality where I as 22 year old still wish I had an owl, a wand and invitation to Hogwarts.  Where was the character development that made the world fall in love Harry, Ron, Hermione and the others?  Who were the ghosts?  Who gave the cloak to Harry?  Why was Dumbledore called out of town?  Where was the mythology of wizards and witches?   Where was the 2nd and 3rd Quidditch match?  Did we know that Harry gave up the last match that would win his house the cup to find the Stone?  What was the significance of the puzzles guarding the stone and who put them there?  Where was Snape's loathing and personal grudge against Harry and his family?  Was Ron poor (an aspect that made me love Ron even more)?  Who were the teachers?  What is the deal with Neville Longbottom?  Where was the perfectly constructed web that J.K. Rowling created with mythology, wonder, intrigue and fantasy?  I didn't even get the sense that Hogwarts was a school.  All these wonderful elements of the book could have been in a 2 and half hour movie but they decided to leave a scene with Dragon and others.  Those of you who read the book could answer these questions.  They were my favorite parts because they dealt with the characters and relationships.  I didn't care about the characters as much because there wasn't enough about them to care bout. Everyone from Snape to Quirrel to Draco even to the Dursley's. Now, it may be hard to believe but I did enjoy myself, because I was able to fill in the blanks in the movie with pages from the book.  I enjoyed it as a movie, but it's hard not to think about what it could have been.  The performances were brilliant.  Daniel Radcliff was charming, sweet and carried all that weight that Harry should. Hermione Granger, whose role could very easily have been over the top, was a perfect mix of cockiness and longing to be part of the group.  Robbie Coltrane was everything that Hagrid should be and more.  I could go on and write about everyone but you get the idea, the casting and performances were perfect.  Overall, it was rushed.  No moment was complete.  No idea was finished.  When I read the first book, I fell in love with the world of Harry Potter. When I saw the movie, I enjoyed it, but missed the things that made fall in love the little boy who lived in the cupboard under the stairs in the first place."
"Arry Poheh","10","0","0","17 November 2001"," Great Movie, but not for all ages...
","Harry Potter is by far the largest craze in the history of fiction. There is not a person on this Earth over the age of 5 who does not know what a muggle is or what a Fizzing Whizbee is. Well, maybe a few, but they all know the name 'Harry Potter.'<br/><br/>I am 14 years of age, and yet I cannot say enough how obsessed I am with the craze. Now in high school, its not cool for me to say that, but I still could hardly wait for November 16.<br/><br/>I saw the movie yesterday at 4 pm, and actually the crowd in the theatre was a wee bit disappointing. It wa not sold out, yet I purchased my tickets (4) two weeks prior. Oh, well.<br/><br/>As I said in my one-sentence synopsis, 'Harry Potter And The Sorcerors's Stone/Philosopher's Stone' is not for young children. Not only does Draco Malfoy say ""ass,"" but some scenes even made me flinch. There is a part of the movie where you see He-Who-Is-Not-To-Be-Named, and he is somewhat disturbing. Also, Fluffy was very loud, and mildly frightening to my friends. Now imagine taking your 7 year old. Not a prime choice. Try next door, at 'Max Keeble's Big Move.'<br/><br/>I gave the movie a '10,' because it was outstandingly (if that's a word) created. The quidditch scene, not giving anything away, was fantastic, and I would be surprised to hear that they worked on it any less than 5 months of the entire movie-making process. Something to look forward to...<br/><br/>Lastly, congratulations to J.K. Rowling on all of her success, and keep writing (By the way, I wouldn't mind finding out about Harry's future, just a hint...)."

The acting was superb, it's good to know that there are still so many great British actors around.  2 1/2 hours is a long time for one film without a break.  However, I don't think anyone noticed the time going - I know I didn't - and in the cinema I was in, the couple of hundred children who sat enthralled throughout the movie could probably have happily sat through the whole four hours of the film's original length. <br/><br/>The translation from written word to motion picture was just right.

Other then that its what I expected bt there where a few more flaws they didn't make you feel sorry for Harry while he was with the Dursleys it just made them look strange instead of mean and to normal and they didn't introduce you to the magic of Harry Potter they just threw you in but it was a good movie and its not Chris Columbus's fault (except the eyes) you just can't take a book that great and make it into a movie thats also that great.

","To get the main question out of the way, is the film as good as the book ? No, but it only falls short by the slightest of margins. To describe those margins would be to give away plot points. So I won't. Personally I don't think any film could completely capture Ms Rowling's imagination, invention, characters and ""just one more chapter"" writing! Whilst I feel the film deserves every success, the books should not become a mere spin-off of the film(s). The film(s) are most definitely a by-product of some wonderful books!<br/><br/>Ok, the film: it's good...very good! Whereas much of Summer 2001's blockbuster fare was vapid, effects driven drivel that felt like over long demonstrations in the art of product placement, Harry Potter is a welcome return to character, storytelling, imagination and genuine entertainment. Rest assured that the film will not disappoint and does in fact measure up to the wall-to-wall publicity.<br/><br/>The three young actors playing Harry, Hermione and Ron portray them so convincingly that it is to their credit that they are not overshadowed by the combined might of Robbie Coltraine, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith to name but a few.<br/><br/>Harry Potter should not be seen because the publicity machines tell you to. Nor should it be seen because your children insist on you taking them to see it. See it because Harry Potter is a film that will transport you to a magical world.

","Transferring book to film is always a tricky subject, especially so in this case with millions of children expectantly waiting to see what they'd imagined come to life on screen.<br/><br/>Having never read any of the Harry Potter books I went in to see this movie without huge expectations. I wasn't disapointed with the end result, but it must be said that even at two and a half hours it still barely covers what the book must've done. <br/><br/>Running length of the first cut was at the 4 and a half hour mark, so it would've been a huge task trimming down to under 3 hours. I felt as though this seems to show in the movie itself. Many characters are introduced yet never investigated, plot threads are given but never uncovered and as a whole it is disjointed and 'bitty'. Chris Columbus has not failed in the sense that the film has that magical fairytale feel to it and that care has been taken in keeping true to the books (to keep the kids happy!).<br/><br/>On the whole a fun film, but in my opinion it has franchise written all over it. Keep an eye out for the 'Quiditch' match though, a classic special effects moment."

","So you're tired of all those kids reporting on the disappointment of seeing their imagination violated when transformed on the big screen by techno-geeks. My son refuses to go because he doesn't want to ruin his vision of this modern classic. Good, but since I couldn't get out from under the staircase in Book 1, I really have nothing to lose.<br/><br/>Aside form the technical wizardry - did I see that sorting ceremony hat in ""A Nightmare Before Christmas""? - costumes - I want that cloak of invisibility -  score - wait, what score? -  this film has its way with the audience incorporating all the escapism we all need.  But this is a fantasy that relegates almost anyone who isn't traditional British white bread to minor roles like sports announcer, Centaur or walk on.  Dare I ask author J.K. Rowlings or director Chris Columbus to bend towards diversity and give us a picture of even those reality-based British suburbia with a touch of multi-culturalism? Or is that too heavy a dose of reality.<br/><br/>The kids are cute and their parts well acted. The story moves and we find ourselves caring for Harry, Ron and Hermione. Did the casting director really look for an Opie look-alike for Harry's hapless sidekick Ron? Harry's muggle family was a little over the top  but the plot-twists were well executed.  It was pleasant to see the solid assortment of English performers who even in cameo roles gave solid performances.  But are they all Caucasians?<br/><br/>What to watch for? There's a great shot of the inner-works of a lock on the vault holding the sorcerer's stone.  The opening scene bridges reality and fantasy very well. The troll trashing the girl's toilet must have been based on memories from secondary education. And Harry's wand selection sequence makes me long for the day that merchants knew their wares.<br/><br/>The night before Harry Potter's opening, Steve Martin appeared on the David Letterman show to hype his new film ""Novocain.""  ""We're opening opposite Harry Potter. (audience laughter) We figured that Harry Potter would appeal to a select audienceÂ…everyone!"" <br/><br/>Maybe next week, Steve."

It seemed more like 15-30 minutes, even though I had to desperately use the bathroom! My mind was completely sucked in; I was so absorbed with the special effects and the simple brilliance of every scene. Unlike so many other movies based on books that I've watched, all the places like Diagon Alley and Hogwarts, Harry's cupboard...were almost exactly like I imagined them! And I was very happy to see that a lot of the actors' dialog is taken directly from Ms. Rowling's books. The kids are great and stay true to their descriptions. (I know that Daniel Radcliffe is practically Harry's twin, but I was a little bummed that he didn't do his hair black...you can just say I'm obsessed with the books.) The only fault I held with it was that the Sorting Hat didn't sing it's poem! OK, so this might seem like a minor detail, I was looking forward to seeing that scene (so was my friend). Overall, Chris Columbus, J.K. Rowling and the cast did an EXCELLENT job!! (For anyone who was confused about Quidditch like I sorta was, when they play you will definitely understand it!

While filming something which originally appeared in print instantly makes it more accessible, as many people can't or won't read, I wondered watching this movie if it is possible to film something as magical as Harry Potter and still have it be magical.  The age old debate about viewing versus imagination is highly appropriate for this film.  Movie technology has become so good that nothing really astounds us any more, and since effects can no longer carry a film, it needs a good story or a fun story to do so. This story, derivative as it is, is not bad, and the movie certainly is fun. The best thing about it is the cast. Every one of them is top notch and bring a humanity to material which could too easily be trite (sometimes it becomes trite anyway, but that probably couldn't be helped).  For that alone, I'm not sorry i saw the film at all.  And, although it is loaded with gimmicks, the gimmicks don't weigh it down the way they often do in other high budget films.  Worth ten bucks, easily."

","I saw magic last night.  Sitting there in the theatre at six in the evening, about to watch one of the most anticipated movies ever made, I decided not to compare it to the book, rather I would enjoy it for what it was and not to nitpick it. What I saw was a stunning movie that substituted fancy action sequences (although there were some real knockout sections) for a heart and soul. Daniel Radcliffe was an AMAZING Harry.  Not only did he look exactly the way that I thought he would, he has very good acting skills for an 11-year old kid. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were also great. Rupert was so adorable and funny, and Emma's Hermione was just as I thought she would be-stuffy on the outside, but on the inside, a genuine and kind person. Professor McGonagall was amazing. Maggie Smith did a very good job of playing her. However, the kid who played Draco Malfoy was awesome! He was such a little snotty brat that you loved to hate him. <br/><br/>
Of course, that doesn't mean that there weren't SOME action sequences.  The scene where Harry plays in his first Quidditch game was amazing! The CGI was incredible, but the Quaffle wasn't round! That was kind of weird.  However, that doesn't compare to my favorite scene in the whole thing: The scene where Harry sees his parents in the Mirror of Erised. That entire scene made me want to cry. Radcliffe did an amazing job of portraying the love and anguish on his face. He's a cutie, too! He's gonna be really cute once the series starts getting into four and five. The guy who played Oliver Wood really didn't strike me as a Keeper.  The book describes him as burly, and this guy was kind of skinny.  But still...I thought he was HOT!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, I was also captivated before the movie even started.  And why? Because I was one of the 1/2 of theatres that got to see the brand new STAR WARS trailer, entitled, ""Forbidden Love"". I was not disappointed.  Hayden Christensen looks like he's going to have no problem filling the Pinocchio performance of Jake Lloyd. The preview shows that he doesn't have trouble portraying real emotion.  But back to Harry Potter.  I wouldn't be surprised if this movie went on to break the records held by TITANIC.  That's how good this adaptation is. See it!"

","Dear all, I have read the book and I thought it was a good read. So I went to see the (extremely advertised) film. What a failure! Trying to stick to the book as much as possible, Columbus managed to give a fragmented story that will make sence, only because most of the audience have read the book already and will be able to fill the (many) gaps of the story. Trying to keep up with the book so much, the director failed to give ""the magic"" of the book, and strangely enough did some unbelievable mistakes: one of the most important aspects of the book is that only Harry and Dumbledore can call Voldemort by his name. What did the director do about that? Scene No 1: Hagrid explains to Harry that some wizards go bad, and on that scene he has trouble saying the name, but not in the next, when he tells Harry the story and mentions Voldemort by his name!!! The same is true for Hermione later. As for the acting part, I believe it was overdone by most of the cast. My opinion: three out of ten."

So I thought that I most as well read the first one and see what all the fuss was all about.I officially became addicted after the first page and every single book after that was no different as they were all fun and exciting.<br/><br/>So from then on I had the 16th November marked down on my calendar and was really hoping that Chris Columbus was not going to ruin the book.

Especially the Quidditch match they completely shooked me because nothing could of prepared me for such brilliant effects, but I wish they did more then one match as they did in the book.<br/><br/>All the characters were played well like harry potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson)but my favourite has to Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), but one thing that was pretty enoring was that Neville Longbottom character was not used much.

"giancarlorocks","10","0","0","16 November 2001"," The Epitome of what a fantasy flick should be...
","In 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'; movie magic is not only created but completely reinvented. To many loyal readers of the J.K. Rowling series, this has been an arduous wait as they have anticipated their inner most imaginative thoughts of these immortal characters be projected onto the screen in a manner befitting of Hollywood fashion. Warner Brothers, the Studio that released the film knew that that they had their hands on a very bankable box office franchise from the very beginning. Yet, the only way to success would be to efficiently and creatively relay all the character development, plot and imagination that was conveyed from the books.<br/><br/>Within this 2hr. and 23 minute opus we are treated to a 'buffet' of cinematic magic.  The characters are engaging, the visual effects are incredible, the plot is condensed yet direct and the pure joy of this film is inexplicable. In short, you will pardon my colloquialism, but this film is what going to the movies is all about. <br/><br/>Our young protagonist is an 11year old wizard, who after being raised by his neglectful aunt and uncle is finally ready for a stay at the Hogwart's School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. While in attendance at this magical and luxurious school and while under the watchful eye of many; he meets his destiny as he proves his worth at saving the school and himself from an elaborate scheme involving the titular stone.<br/><br/>As unlike many films  this past year, this film on the other hand functions on many levels. The first mark at knowing a great family film when seeing one is viewing the complete silence of a theatre filled with children and not even one child 'budge' during this fairly lengthy family film. Secondly, it is clear that the film stays true to the novel and makes no attempt at tainting plot for the sake of running time. Thirdly, the end product is an incredible film that will clearly re-launch the Warner Studio back to the head of the industry.<br/><br/>While reading this review, one may easily wonder why the praise for this film is plentiful. Therefore, allow me to elaborate and conjure up many reasons why this film is indeed a great film. Besides the  three prior characteristics given to explain the greatness of the film, there is another more outstanding trait that many may not realize. That trait is found in the casting. Our young Harry Potter is played by the young Daniel Radcliffe, a relative newcomer to the business considering he has only appeared in only one another film,  'The Tailor of Panama'. Potter is played with a mix of brilliance and coyness by Radcliffe, who is absolutely photogenic  resulting in an attraction that  is sustained  for the duration of the film. Potter is a calm, everyday looking child who is played by an actor that certainly seemed to  enjoy the part as he is constantly grinning throughout the whole film; even in the transition shots. Furthermore, our filmmaker knew that the secret to holding our attention was not only casting a great Potter, but assembling a great cast of supporting child actors who will befriend our Harry Potter and join him in his quest resulting in much screen time as well. This was found in Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. They both respectively play Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and are astonishing as two of Harry's partners in unraveling a great mystery locked away at Hogwarth's.<br/><br/>In addition to our child actors; very respectable, prominent British actors are included in the epic adaptation of the book. Richard Harris stars as Headmaster Albus Dumbeldore, Alan Rickman as the deliciously mysterious Professor Severus Snape and Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagell. They all  have well grounded roles that shape this film into an enjoyable and fantastic family adventure. Furthermore, the spirit of the book is captured by Steven Kloves' screenwriting as many moments of the book are brought to screen in a picturesque and larger than life way. Among them, the highlighted scene of the film that shows Potter playing the game of Quidditch. This game is a mix of soccer, rugby and hockey all while being played on a flying broom. Also, the trolls, the goblins and Fluffy; the threeheaded dog will all bring a smle to the experienced readers' eye as the fictitious characters have been personified on screen and thus immortalized.<br/><br/>Yet, what good would all this be without the craftsmanship of a director who knows how to handle child actors. Chris Columbus who is most known for the first two  'Home Alone' films steers this film and presents us with a cinematic experience unlike anything we have ever seen before. While exhibiting a Gothic look that appears to be out of the Tim Burton school of production design, this film instills within its' viewer a sense of awe that is pervasive. The film's dark tone somehow balances itself between the darker themes and  its' lighter themes resulting in a flawless mix. This can be seen within  the incredible intense climax in which a dual faced character appears  resulting in a fierce battle with our hero that leaves a body to metamorphisize into ashes.This scene to some parents was so intense that some  deemed it too graphic and left the theatre with their children for the duration of the climax. <br/><br/>If there will be one complaint about the film it will be the climax. Yet,  one must respect the film's ambitiousness and audacity at carrying out the book's vision in a manner that pleases the loyal fan while revealing this series of books to a whole new audience. In a nutshell, this film is pure magic. And as the ticket counters at the theatres are clinging away just as you read this; do not be surprised if it breaks the biggest cinematic box office grosser of all time.Sinking that already sunken ship is magic in itself and this film has plenty of it, resulting in repeat business that will surely give justice to the film's many subtle moments creating more discovery than on its' first viewing.

","To me, the movie wasn't all that great. It skipped a lot of parts from the book. I know they couldn't ALL be included due to running time, but a few MAJOR parts were left out, leaving all who have read the book wondering when it's going to happen. Also, some of the acting is bad at the beginning. Dumbeldore and McGonagall weren't that great then. It sounded pretty robotic. The special effects were GREAT, however! It gets brownie points from me on that. It's a great children's movie, but for people like me that really spot out stuff that is wrong, it's a little less than wonderful."

","I've been anticipating this film for more than a year, and finally I saw it last night, at 10PM. I've read all four books several times, the first one the most, and I just can't get enough of Hogwarts. When I saw the film I was a thinking about how the sped through the beginning, and cut out a lot of dialouge.      At Hogwarts I thought they could have done more with the school, and the classes to make it more magical, but I thought the special effects were brilliant!! THe Weasley Twins were so funny, although they didn't really have any big lines. Unfortunately they skipped out my favorite part when they say 'We know our names are Gred and Forge'. Hagrid was JUST as I imagined him and I was so pleased. Percy might not have been snooty enough, Hermione was so great, especially in her first seen, Ron was hysterical with all of his sarcastic, witty lines, Harry was magnificent! I must say, Harry Potter must be a hard part to play in a movie because basically the whole book was him thinking, and Daniel Radcliffe had to portray that through his facial expressions. I loved all the teachers, with the exception of Snape, he didn't look anything like a imagined, but he was still good.<br/><br/>    I just wish that they hadn't changed so many parts, and cut it, and rushed through the beginning, because I really loved the book. I thought the movie was great! And I loved it too, but nothing, can compare to the books. If I had to rate this film, I would probably give it about 8/10. :D<br/><br/>   Oh and, I thought Neville was perfect!! Especially at the end when he's given ten points."

","The movie was awesome!! But, of course, did I expect anything different?<br/><br/>There are some things that I kind of wished for, but I understand that they needed to cut back some because of time: 1) More of the Dursleys. 2) More of Harry's delight upon leaving the Dursleys. 3) More Snape!! 4) More Neville Longbottom. That is all. The part where Lily Potter is killed was interesting. Richard Harris was good as Dumbledore. Daniel Radcliffe seemed to have only three faces; not very big on the showing emotions part he is. Rupert Gint, who plays Ron, is wonderful, as is Hermione. But, like their characters, they will be overshadowed a bit by Daniel. The Quidditch game (pity there was only one) was one of the best parts. Another great scene was the chess scene. <br/><br/>The soundtrack by John Williams is great, although I felt that they used too much of it. Sometimes silence is golden in a scene, but that's just my opinion.<br/><br/>All in all, I highly recommend those to see it."

","Thank God for Harry Potter. Yes this is a phenomenon, yes this needed the book to be where it is, and YES it's been hyped, and good for it! Is that a sin? Not when I checked. I'll be honest, I've never laid a finger on the books, so regarding the accuracy and faithfulness of the book I can't comment on. But A) I understood it, so it obviously stood on it's own. B) The production team, all of it, has created ""muggle"" magic.<br/><br/>This has it's flaws, but what film doesn't? This is a film that allows us to escape, forget our problems for a hunky fast moving 2 and a half hours, and dive into a startlingly realistic, not to mention bright and happy, world of children, magic, wizardry, and evil. I found myself applauding during the Quidditch (sp?) scenes, as if it was perfectly normal for kids to ride 70 feet in the air on broomsticks and get bruised up, that jellybeans come in every flavor (including certain excretory material, you'll see), and that kids can jump through brick walls onto a fractional train platform. What fun!<br/><br/>Oh! For shame you critics who refuse to enjoy! This film is for enjoyment. This has lots of eye candy, beautiful stuff, dazzling stuff. But it's not at all empty. If you need serious content, I was surprised to find deep running currents, thematic elements, that are unusually mature. The pyschological effects of a child who has lived in an emotional abusive environment for years on end were well portrayed in several scenes. Borderline personalities in several characters. The age old theme of giving one's life for another; the Faustian plot of giving your soul up for personal gain; the danger of dwelling in an inate state instead of movement to some form of action; and of destiny. Pretty heavy for so called (and here paraphrased) ""hollow kid stuff"". <br/><br/>Are you gonna listen to complaining religious fundamentalists, snobs, and critics?

Maggie Smith's and Robbie Coltrane's performances were excellent, yet by far, the three children were the best! The film stuck very close to the book's contents, changing some scenes around and modifying some subplots to keep the film shorter but to the lay person without having read the book, the changes would not spoil the film.

","The movie starts off disappointingly slow, and Daniel Radcliffe, the boy playing the famous 'Boy Who Lived' at first delivers such an exaggerated performance that I was afraid he would turn out to be just another cardboard child actor, but then about fifteen minutes into the movie, everything picks up and I ended up having one of the best movie experiences of the year!<br/><br/>Though not on the same preternaturally mature acting level as Haley Joel Osment (and aside from some very melodramatically surprised expressions he pulls when he first finds out he's a wizard), Radcliffe has enough range, guts, and charm to make one astonishingly convincing Harry Potter.  He projects best when Harry's upset, determined, or eager -- best, in fact, when he's just being a regular kid who just happens to know magic.   I wouldn't have had Harry Potter played any other way, or by any other person!<br/><br/>Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are cast perfectly as Harry's best friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.  Watson brings the perfect amount of eccentricity to her role as a, well, a know-it-all, and Grint pulls well-timed comical expressions that had people laughing without him even having to say anything.<br/><br/>The adults in the movie were perfect in their roles.  Robbie Coltrane was great as the giant, loose-lipped, soft-hearted Rubeus Hagrid, Richard Harris made for a low-key Dumbledore, and Alan Rickman did an excellent job at being Snape, in spite of getting short shrift in terms of development.<br/><br/>The music is yet another triumph from the incomparable John Williams.  It evokes the mystery, magic, whimsy, and sheer adventure of the books perfectly!  Indeed, the fast-paced action scores may even have helped save some scenes from looking too dull or too fake.<br/><br/>The special effects are sometimes superb (for the smaller magic tricks) and sometimes disappointingly obvious (for most of the bigger ones), but it's not difficult to understand in some of the more dangerous scenes.  I'd rather have a CGI Harry hurled around at breakneck speed on a renegade broomstick a thousand feet off the ground than risk killing the real thing! On the other hand, some CGI'd characters stylistically looked an awful lot like they came from the PlayStation version of Harry Potter (essentially moving more like plastic or rubber than real people).  With the budget the movie had, I felt there could have been more work on the realistic look of the CGI.  On the OTHER hand, Chris Columbus brought in just enough close-up live action shots and real-people stunt shots for me to overlook the fakeness.<br/><br/>One thing that never went wrong in the movie were the action sequences. They were absolutely stunning!  Everything from Harry's dangerous search for the Sorcerer's Stone to the heart-pumping battle over the Golden Snitch was well-directed, well-shot and well-cut.<br/><br/>In conclusion:  The movie was fabulous!

","OK, it's got some funny moments and some inspired little bits not in the book (I loved the tip of the hat to Gladiator just before the Quidditch match), but it is not the whimsical, innovative movie it could have been. Excellently cast but most of the actors seemed to be somewhat subdued (Daniel Radcliffe as Potter is particularly wooden).<br/><br/>I know it's a daunting task to bring such a colorful, fanciful, detailed world from the page to celluloid, but I feel it still could have been done with a little more flair and invention. At times, it seems like they were just ticking off the events and characters in the book, just to make sure everything and everyone got to shuffle across the screen (save a few items that were left out for time and narrative concerns, presumably).<br/><br/>I also did not see nearly enough of Quidditch, or Alan Rickman. His Snape is just as oily and mean as the book's, but with an amusing dash of dementia. You stop just short of hating him when you realize he reminds you vaguely of Ally Sheedy's character in the Breakfast Club. Or maybe it was just me.<br/><br/>Also, since it's already just over 2.5 hours, I really question the few things they left out...at such a length, certain minor characters and story points needn't have been sacrificed.<br/><br/>My son ate it up though. He'll surely see it again. I might pass."

","Though Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was a very entertaining movie and extremely faithful to the book, it did leave a little to be desired. The movie was two and a half hours long, and oftentimes I found myself thinking, ""alright, alright, get onto the next part!"" I had read the book, but ages ago, and I barely remembered any of it, so I don't think my knowledge of the story was very responsible for these feelings.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I was quite unhappy to see that Harry's eyes were blue when JK Rowling said in an interview that it was very important for later events in the story for him to have green eyes, which he does in the book. There were very few scenes inside the classrooms, and the dialogue about Sirius Black (which we all know becomes very important later!!) was omitted from the scenes with Hagrid bringing Harry to his aunt and uncle's. Speaking of that scene, the lines were very poorly delivered. Ie: Dumbledore, when seeing the cat, says, ""I didn't expect to see you here... Professor McGonagall!"" (or something to that effect), as though it's this huge, amazing, crazy thing, only the pause between ""I didn't expect to see you here..."" and ""Professor McGonagall!"" is horrible. I would have liked to have seen more Quidditch, as well! It was such an important sport in the book and yet there was only one five to ten-minute game of it in the movie. The characters we had all grown to know and love in the book, such as Angelina, Katie, Parvatti, as well as the fun and crazy exploits of Fred and George, were completely omitted.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was entertaining, though it dragged on, and it was mostly faithful to the book. However, I will not be seeing it a second time- and that is saying something, because I usually see movies many times over in the theatres. I would give it 2 1/2 stars out of five."
"JNMassie","Null","0","0","16 November 2001"," I'm just wild about Harry (more or less ...)
","Not exactly *wild* but I really wanted to use that heading...<br/><br/>The good news is that they most certainly haven't screwed it up.  The film is faithful to Rowling almost to a fault. Hogwarts looks like Hogwarts, and they've got Quidditch down just right. Only the most rabid Potterites will find fault with what's missing from the book (Peeves, some of the Malfoy scenes, a lot of the Dursley stuff) or what's added (Dudley's birthday and the reptile house sequence from Chamber of Secrets).<br/><br/>The kids are alright. Emma Watson may be the ""breakout star"" of the trio, she strikes just the right bossy tone, although I agree with the LA Times that she's a bit too cute (remember that Hermione is supposed to have bushy hair and buck teeth). The Malfoy and the Dudley are deliciously evil. Ron is sardonic and loyal, and a fine foil for Hermione.  At first, Daniel Radcliffe seemed just a little overwhelmed but he can hardly be blamed for that.  The Mirror of Erised scene pulled me in, and from then on the kid seemed to find his stride.<br/><br/>I don't know why at first I couldn't get used to the casting of Robbie Coltrane but now I can't imagine a better Hagrid, far and away the best adult performance. Except in the Mirror scene Richard Harris seemed limp as Dumbledore, I'm disappointed but not surprised 'cause I've never been a fan of his (it's really too bad Ian McKellen was off playing Gandalf). Most of the adult roles are little more than walk-ons so it's a bit unfair to comment on what little I saw of Maggie Smith or Alan Rickman (McGonigall and Snape).<br/><br/>The people who've been saying three hours is too long for a kiddie movie forget how hypnotic all this can be; the kids in the audience ate it all up (10:30 am on Friday, and I wasn't the only one playing hooky!). I'm really fed up with movies that use CGI to cover bad writing, but that's not the case here. Of course you couldn't've made this movie without computer efx, but they should have left the swooping camera shots for just the Quidditch sequence, I started getting nauseous every time they cut to the Great Hall with all the owl POVs.<br/><br/>Congratulations to screenwriter Steve Kloves for getting so much of the book into the movie without its running seven hours.  This is Chris Columbus's best movie since Gremlins but that ain't saying much of anything.  He's certainly channeling Spielberg as well as ever, but I do not mean that as a compliment. What I really, *really* hate is John Williams reminding me when the Big Moments are arriving.  Rowling trusts her readers to find their own moments; Columbus and Williams would do well to learn to do the same (and come to think of it so would Spielberg!)<br/><br/>In short, the best popcorn movie of the year (in a year that frankly hasn't had much of any yet except for Shrek).

","I don`t rate JK Rowling as a writer so when the hype machine stated that HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER`S STONE ( As it`s called in Britain ) was going to be faithful to the book I thought this was a film that wasn`t worth seeing but I decided to give it a chance , after all I hadn`t expected much from THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING but I ended up falling in love with Peter Jackson`s beautiful masterpiece . But after watching THE PHILOSOPHER`S STONE my instincts had been proved right and in many ways the film had lived down to expectations .<br/><br/>First of all I found it highly patronizing the way it talks down to its audience in a very substandard Roald Dahl way . Secondly the film has far too many characters that add nothing to the plot , and thirdly I`m not sure if the film actually has a plot . Yeah things happen but many of these things don`t seem to lead to anything so why were they included ?<br/><br/>
I noticed the second Harry Potter film didn`t perform as well as hoped which gives me hope that the next films in the franchise bomb big time . And I reckon Frodo Baggins could kick Harry Potter`s ass"
"MrMowji","1","4","12","28 October 2017"," It's about magic!
","Maybe the first problem with this kind of movies is their subject; MAGIC. We cannot argue about any aspects of it, because it's magic; anything is possible, we must shut our mouths and sit like a good kid and watch it without any digestion. And that's where the problem grows. We see lots of possible things without any background or history and yet we see some normal things that they cannot do, for example they have this cloak to hide but this could be unnecessary. Why couldn't they just hide themselves with that sticks? Oh, they're not able to do that!!!<br/><br/>The story isn't good at all. Believe me. If you love yourself don't watch it. Don't go through the series at all, seriously. Even if this was supposed to have some philosophical meanings, the magics stacked in this series don't allow the viewer to grasp them. It isn't like Lord of the Rings. No messages I could get, no meaning as others state.<br/><br/>Acting was awful, maybe not as bad as Twilight's actors, but it was still very bad. Funny moments wasn't funny at all. No drama. No nothing. Couldn't care about any of the characters. It's really a family movie as categorized. It has the story to make a movie colorful.<br/><br/>Worst thing about it: Harry Potter takes 8 episodes to finish. What was the writer drinking? It could be done in 180 minutes at most. Lots (and I mean lots) of unnecessary characters and subplots. I think the writer got bored herself and decided to end writing, because if you see all 8 episodes you can see that the story is flexible and can be easily stretched out as the writer did. Any teenager can do it.<br/><br/>DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."

If you never read the book, You will probably lost. The show is going too fast.<br/><br/>Actors = grrrr = lousy. They are lousy alright. They should never be in such a big movie. The director should have chose better actors. All the actors in the movie are lousy, if the not the worst.<br/><br/>Background music - I dont think they put in any effort about the music. It is the same music for the whole movie. Rather annoying.<br/><br/>Lastly, the director sucks. i dont care if he directed Home Alones, he definitely suck at these. Steven Spielberg would have done a better job. But he bowed out when JK Rowling said the actors must be British. He was right. No offence to British people.<br/><br/>Now, i suggest you should spend money on Lord of the Ring. Wait till The Secret Of Chamber is out.

","Awful. The biggest Xmas turkey of all time. The book has taken the world by storm and yet there's not enough in the movie to interest anybody other than die hard fans who feel they can't miss the incarnation of their favourite characters.<br/><br/>Principal blame must be laid at the door of the mindnumbingly unimaginative script. Robbie Coltrane is one of the greatest comic actors of all time - right up there with WC Fields - and despite appearing twice lifesize with an hilarious costume, his funniest line is ""I don't think I was supposed to tell you that"". Criminal delinquence abounds - Alan Rickman  utterly wasted, John Cleese given two lines of exposition, Julie Walters, Ian Hart, Zoe Wanamaker given nothing at all to work with. Living with Dursleys looks like it might be more interesting than Hogwarts, largely because Richard Griffith and Fiona Shaw can turn even this ham into something tasty.<br/><br/>And then there's the truly awful, pedestrian direction, which shows most in the failure to extract a single memorable second from the obvious acting talent and leaves the suggested talent, particularly that of Daniel Radcliffe and the amazingly promising Emma Watson, totally untapped.<br/><br/>I'm sure the reason behind the book's success is that it got kids thinking - using their imaginations. It certainly doesn't appear to have worked on the crew of dismal underachievers responsible for the film."

The story line wasn't as strong as I would have liked to have seen it but what I do know is the main actors in the first two films weren't great.<br/><br/>The casting in general was really good cause from prisoner of Azkaban and onwards, the acting got better and so did the movies but, it wasn't believable. Of course Snape was brilliant! <br/><br/>Over rated is an understatement though. There are too many people that now they've seen Harry Potter, won't give any other movies a chance because apparently 'nothing is as good as Harry Potter'. It is a great franchise and everything but apparently they can't see anything else. Most people won't give other films like my personal favourites, lord of the rings and the hobbit, a chance because 'it's not harry potter'.

","I had read J. K. Rowling's first Harry Potter book before I saw its cinematic adaptation (it happened the other way round in the case of the remaining instalments) and I was very pleased with the movie. I still am. Chris Columbus was criticised for being too slavishly faithful to the book but in my view that was just the right approach. The movie presented Harry Potter's world exactly the way I had envisioned it. The cast was perfect, the tone was perfect, the visuals were perfect. Granted, the book is richer and funnier (Rowling has a very British, wicked sense of humour) but it is ultimately a children's book with a universal message about the value of love, friendship and courage, so, in my opinion, veering towards a darker, more grotesque feel would have been a mistake.<br/><br/>Having seen the whole story, Harry Potter & The Sorcerer's Stone remains one of my favourites from the saga (for me, the top spot goes to the second one, The Chamber of Secrets). Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are especially adorable in this one, the former actually having his most heroic moment here with the wizard's chess.<br/><br/>Great entertainment for kids and the young at heart, endlessly rewatchable true movie magic that has a well-earned place among the greatest modern fairy-tales, that is, George Lucas's Star Wars (episodes I-VI) and Tolkien's/Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings & The Hobbit."

","Harry Potter means a lot to me, I've watched this movie when I was 12 years old after reading the 2 first books. Rowling's book was the first real book (no pictures, no big fonts, no pop-ups) I've ever read so when I entered the movie theater it was like entering a world I had seen before only in my imagination and I still remember that day now 10 years later. <br/><br/>Even though there's a lot of things different from JK Rowling's novel I wouldn't change a thing about this movie - Perhaps put some contact lens on Daniel, I was kinda disappointed he didn't have green eyes like Lily's- . First because you could never be 100% loyal to a book and second because I think Chris Columbus made a wonderful job. <br/><br/>I've watched this movie at least 30 times and each time feels like the first, and each time a piece of that girl I was at 12 years old comes back and it feels great to know I still have her with me. I hope one day taking my kids to a movie theater to watch this movie (since they'll obviously release again someday) so they will feel what I've felt 10 years ago.<br/><br/>Harry Potter lives inside the heart of a generation and it's amazing to see that his story came from the books to the movies without losing its magic."
"monkey_manmarge","2","2","5","6 December 2005"," Boo, Chris Columbus!
","Okay, I just need to explain, I didn't start to hate Chris Columbus' work until I saw the difference that Alfonso Cuaron made when he directed it. I have already seen the fourth film and I loved it, but if you want to hear about that, search my name...<br/><br/>Okay, this is why Chris Columbus sucks... this film was truly an effects-filled family flick. It is more pleasing to those who didn't read the book. Also, did anyone notice that Dan, Rupert, and Emma's acting abilities didn't improve noticeably until they got a new director, Cuaron, and then another one, Newell, with which they improved a lot. Also, none of the kid characters really had personalities! Instead of focusing on the characters, Columbus focused on putting CGI into any place he could, thus drawing attention away from the plot and characters, which are very believable despite all the fantasy behind it. So, mainly what I just said is that Columbus focuses mainly on the fact that these people are magical than the fact that they have personalities."

","This is what happens when you let an American director completely spoil a superb British book (yes nothing to do with America at all). There is so much missed out of this film that was in the book, and some of the parts that are in the book have been changed and they are so lame it's unbelievable. As for the characters, I don't think i've ever seen an actor (if you can call him that) as wooden as Daniel Radcliffe. Another mistake by the Americans, picking an actor as expressionless as Radcliffe to play our main character. Ron is OK, but he is how you would imagine him to be. Hermione may be fit but she's way too soppy for the film and doesn't do the Hermione from the book justice. As for Alan Rickman as Snape, you couldn't pick a worse person for the part. Don't get me wrong, Rickman is a fantastic actor, but I couldn't stand to watch him in this. His performance can only be summed up in one word: pathetic. Now that Columbus and Cuaron have f*cked off and handed over the directing reigns to an Englishman, I look forward to the new film, the Goblet of Fire. I hope that this new director, brings Harry Potter to life and save the books, now that Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuaron have given them such a sh*t reputation with their weak, atrocious portrayals of what is, in my opinion, one of the best books I've ever read. Miss it if you can, and oh yeah, i am not prejudiced against Americans but it's called Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, none of this Sorcerer's Stone crap thank you very much!"

","Adaptation of J.K. Rowling's very popular book is as good an adaptation as possible...but it doesn't completely work.<br/><br/>The big problem was they were afraid to cut anything out of the book (they'd have school children all around the world after them), so they try to put everything in and there's too much for one movie.  Also it's a virtual word-by-word recitation of the book--if you've read the book, you've seen the movie.  This doesn't allow director Chris Columbus any leeway to change things or add his own personal stamp (not that Columbus was ever an inventive director to begin with).  So, it just ends up being the book visualized exactly as written.<br/><br/>The acting is so-so.  The kids picked to play Harry, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are pretty good--not great, but certainly not bad.  The adults vary wildly--Maggie Smith and Zoe Wanamaker (love her yellow eyes!) are just great as teachers at Hogwats...Alan Rickman, Richard Harris and Robbie Coltrane are horrible...they're REALLY not enjoying themselves.  Also John Williams bombastic score is annoying.<br/><br/>Still, it looks great, moves fairly quickly and there's a fantastic sequence showing a Quidditch game.  So, it's OK but nothing great.

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, based on the novel it seems every kid has read (to my surprise considering that I hated reading most books as a kid, especially ones that looked longer than 200 pages and had little or no pictures but then I'm not a kid anymore) is now a movie and while it is certainly overrated and sometimes stupid, it gives some decent moments of entertainment.  It is another film that will depend on the viewer on how much he/she can take with near non-stop adventure and (impressive) visual effects.  It's a wonder the film made 93 million in one weekend (isn't that a sign of biblical armageddon though), but since the film is directed a lot more at kids it's not a total surprise since the movie gets a big reccomendation in the family film department.  But teens and adults might not want to walk in the theater prepared to see the greatest film since Wizard of Oz like the kids are.  <br/><br/>A little long but never really boring, Harrpy Potter offers up a nice stew of excitement on this thanksgiving weekend with some great visuals and score (from John Williams).

"michaelchikliscares","4","1","2","21 January 2020"," Rewatch of 2020
","Watching this Harry Potter movie over with nostalgia, although I am getting to the fair play criticism here.<br/><br/>Downside of this movie. The dialog is pretty predictable, kid friendly, too many special effects overused. Plotting is going too fast in this movie, even before the opening titles we don't get any reasonable Harry family sacrifice for his child. It is obvious that the movie is gonna have flashbacks in every sequel.<br/><br/>Dumbledore doesn't feel like the Dumbledore we had in the third movie, that is why recasting of the death of the actor, I don't think he really fitted the role of the Dumbledore.<br/><br/>Harry, Ron and Hermonie leaving off to the chamber leaves reasonable opening questions, why does the movie always have to side with the main character going inside and face Voldemort alone ? Why does Ron have to sit on the horse while getting hit, he just could of commanded the horse solo without any injuries. I think the wand riding in the movies pretty clunky and awkward too.<br/><br/>This leaves me to the opening plot: Why Hermonie is witty and the smartest , should she be ordered to leave to a higher year because she knows too many spells already, the wizard committee could of already seen her potential being higher in her classes, also this might is the reason why the movie gets the excuse to involve her in so much plotting, she teaching Harry and Ron all the time and saving them with comfortable spells.<br/><br/>The movie is clunky overall, why would Harry, Ron and Hermy would get thrown to the woods of detention with Hagrid , Hagrid sends Harry and Malfoy to wander alone just for them to have the scene.<br/><br/>The movie kind of does nothing with the extra characters, we get a little bit Ginny and Neville but that is it. Snape saved this movie, he is the most important saver of this movie and Hagrid is a comfortable comic relief."

Some things like the special effects, visuals and sets were groundbreaking back in 2001 and it still holds up today except that I can sadly tell that it's CGI at times but I didn't mind it at all. It still has the same heart, the characters are still great, intriguing, funny and well cast. I almost remembered every single scene except for a couple minor ones, I have watched these movies so many times and I still find them enjoyable, even as an adult. Today I noticed that the movie got nominated to 3 Oscars and they were right to get nominations, the music and soundtrack by John Williams should have won as it is something unique and perfect, one of my all time favorite movie soundtracks as it just flows so well with the movie.<br/><br/>The characters are incredible and the actors playing them is also incredible, being a child actor must be hard at times but it seems they grew up fine with being one of the most known children and teenagers on the movie screen, they did good work with portraying their characters and actually making it realistic with the bullying and such.

"BusaLeLizweBo","9","1","2","23 December 2018"," An almost perfect introduction
","I believe that the ""Harry Potter"" series needs no introduction, but just in case, this is the first movie in the eight-part series based on J. K. Rowling's, at this point classic, novels. It's about a young eleven-year-old boy whose parents got killed by an evil wizard Voldemort when Harry was a baby. After being raised (and mistreated) by his aunt and uncle not to know anything about the wizarding world, he learns of his true origin when he's admitted into the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The rest is history.<br/><br/>This is a charming and magical start to a wonderful series with a perfect atmosphere, music, acting and overall direction. No doubt Chris Columbus knew what he was doing and he absolutely nailed the tone. It's magical and the way the world unfolds before our eyes feels organic. All the comopnents make the magic almost tangible.<br/><br/>When we mention the magical feeling of the movie, we can't go without mentioning John Williams' iconic score. His music feels like a natural part of the world, like an entity of its own. And how can we forget the nostalgic value it bring to so many people (including me)? It's very easy for those who grew up with the series get teary-eyed at some particular moments that the music enhances. Among many other things, the music brings Rowling's story to life the way it feels like it was meant to be.<br/><br/>The casting is excellent and the characters feel like they have been pulled out straight from the book. The child actors and the adult veterans make for a delightful bunch that yoi can't help but warm up to. Everyone has their own personality and such a variety is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>However, one thing that holds it back a little is that the world-building comes at the expense of a slick-moving plot. Obviously, this is a large world that we need to be introduced to and understand its rules and that's why the plot doesn't truly kick in until sometime in the second half. Also, some CGI did not age very well, but it was 2001, I think we can let it slide. Especially since most of it actually holds up quite well.<br/><br/>Of course, it didn't contain every single thing from the books, but it's overall a worthy and magical adaptation. If you haven't watched this yet, what are you waiting for? If you want a magical escape, you won't only get that, but the beggining of an epic adventure that you won't forget soon."

"ElMaruecan82","9","1","2","11 November 2018"," And so began a decade-defining saga...
","""What's a Muggle?""<br/><br/>Two minutes after the film started and that was the first question I asked, my young brother told me the word defined people without magical abilities. A sort of wizard-goyim I guess. Anyway, I can't describe the satisfaction I felt over getting that simple information. Knowing the meaning of ""Muggle"" was strangely overwhelming.<br/><br/>Indeed, the series stopped almost one decade ago, started nearly two, and the books are now part of pop (and legitimate) culture and children's literature heritage... so the fact that I resisted so long gave an additional aura of mystification and I was getting my first real peek on the classic. Forget about Harry Potter, Hermione, Voldemort and Dumbledore (names I got amateurishly mixed), I lost a virginity when I knew what the Muggle was. My curiosity deepened and I was ready to embrace J.K. Rowling's universe. I wasn't a Muggle anymore.<br/><br/>And I was glad I waited for so long, I knew I wouldn't get all the names right, I hadn't read the books (I was a teen when the film came out), I wasn't millennial enough to be part of the Harry Potter mania unlike my brother (who's ten years younger) and had his childhood shaped by the bespectacled sorcerer, Pikachu and Lizzie McGuire. I didn't even have the basic curiosity of the average movie lover because I was never into fantasy or movies about magic to begin with. I thought such stories could provide any contrived twist or last-minute Ex Machina simply by toying with their own rules. When a curse can be done or undone, when powers leave no holds barred, what are the stakes? Where's the danger?<br/><br/>I'm glad I could undo the curse of my lousy stubbornness and watch for the first time the first opus of the century-defining saga ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". I enjoyed every bit of it and I found it a charm I knew was going to fade over the course of my discovery. You know when you look back to the first movies. I suspected the tone was going to get darker as the kids grow up, as JK Rowling got more confidence in her success and didn't try to make something trendy or fun. So I savored the first film not as a franchise starter, but like as a standalone, charming fantasy movie, confident that Chris Columbus was the right director and that every cast-member was the right choice.<br/><br/>Cast-wise, the director respected Rowling's condition before selling the book's rights so the film is a roll-call of all established British and/or Irish actors: Richard Harris as the Merlin-like wizard Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagol, scene-stealing Robbie Coltrane as the gentle giant Hagrid, the one who gratifies us with every information we'd need to let the plot move on despite a catchphrase that consists of ""I shouldn't have said that"". Also starring John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Richard Griffith, Ian Hart, Fiona Shaw, and three baby-faced newcomers named Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.<br/><br/>The film is a school-case of how to get the right actors to play the right parts... and that goes for the little ones. If you examine the child actors, they're not perfect but never is the imperfection undermining the believability of their characters: they're kids with magical powers so we have to consider that their normal behavior is also conditioned by such abilities. And maybe that was the core of Harry Potter's appeal, ordinary children dealing with extraordinary powers. When they listen to advice, they know more than anyone the extent of the danger awaiting them... when they learn tricks or magical spells, they can't be too excited either, they learn it like stuff they would teach you in class.<br/><br/>The adult actors convey the perfect mix of normality-within-strangeness. In fact, the whole film is about an extraordinary world showed in the most mundane and matter-of-factly way, and the reason why it works so well is the same as comedy. Comedies don't feature people making other people laugh, actually, seeing someone angry can be the funniest thing. Fantasy works the same way, you can't have characters being impressed every second, let the viewers do all the wowing... but then again, Harry Potter is the newcomer so he represents our own perspective, he's got that capability to be impressed, to enjoy his powers like a ""normal"" child would do.<br/><br/>And that's the charm of the film: we're amazed at the magic and at Harry's own amazement, it finds the right balance between fantasy and ""reality"" in every single department: acting, storytelling and naturally set design. Hogwarts Schools looks like your typical British school with its high walls, Victorian decorations and Dickensian interiors but never exactly feels like a haunted mansion. There are also sscenes set in plain daylight with a comforting blue sky like the brooms training and the unforgettable Quidditch game.<br/><br/>And here and there, you have a few effects to keep you on guars. There's a scene where Harry Potter opens a book and I got my first jump scare, I like that this scary gag isn't overplayed, one is just enough, like Ebert said: it is scary but not too scary. The story never lets itself being dependent on ""effects"", and cares about Potter and his friends above everything else, providing him a promising backstory, explaining his scar on the forehead, his magical gift and why he's got a nemesis already.<br/><br/>On a side note, 2001 was a terrific year for the fantasy genre as it saw the release of three successful franchise: ""Shrek"", ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"" as the most family-friendly. I read about the title's translation that the producers were afraid to use ""Philosopher"" instead of ""Sorcerer"". I think they should used the French title; ""Harry Potter and the Wizard School"", that was catchy enough without being too misleading."

","So I may be 17 years late to the Harry Potter fanatics, but better late then never. Why have I been missing out all these years? So if you are like me, and never got round to watching the most known film series then you need to get a move on. It has a wonderful fantasy storyline from start to finish, which is makes you feel so invited into the magical world of Hogwarts.
For a film that is nearly 2 decades old now, it was a pleasant surprise how good the graphics were, you truly believe that there is such thing a magic. Another thing that surprised me was the quality of the acting for young adolescents. Even from the first film you can understand to why they were able to carry on for another 7 more, the relationships are already building like a real school environment. Little scenarios in this film are seen as obviously, but the overall view is that after this film, it will make you want to watch the next.
What I like about this film is that it can be watched by children, teenagers and adults and passed along the generations. The added humour, jokes and 'sassyness' makes the film lighthearted and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Personally I'm not one for long films unless it truly grips me, and this film done just that. I just couldn't wait until the end, not because i wanted it to finish, but because it left me so curious to the conclusion of the film. And furthering that, I cant wait to watch the next one. However I'm not going to lie to you, I have nothing to compare it to, I have not read the books, and by some other reviews, the film didn't do it justice."

","An entire fictional world for any ages
Harry Potter is a movie franchise based on JK Rowling's books. It tells the story of a 11 year-old boy, named Harry Potter, who suddenly discovers his identity as a wizard and is invited to join Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At Hogwarts he becomes friend of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all together they fight against the evil character of the story: Lord Voldemort.
When it was released, it immediatly became a fever between the public, specially teenagers. It all because it creates a world full of magic where you can find a lot of social problems that we also have in our society. Watching the movies (or reading the books) you can follow social problems as prejudice, the search of an identity (that you can find as long as Harry tries to understand himself), family and relationship problems etc.
That kind of movie is realy important, because it helps people understand they're lives and identify themselves with the characters, while getting entertained.
That's why this is such an incredible movie franchise."

"OscarMcGeachie1995","5","1","2","8 October 2018"," Read the book before you watch the film
","I was six years old when 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' first came out in 2001, and my Dad took my sister Beulah, who was nearly eight years old at the time, and had already read the book, to see it at the Movie House Cinema.<br/><br/>First of all, it is directed by Chris Columbus who directed comedy films like ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs Doubtfire"". Second, like most of the later Harry Potter films, it is a 2-hour film which leaves out a couple of important characters and scenes.<br/><br/>It leaves out the introduction to the Dursleys, Mr Dursley's day at work when he hears the news about the Potters before we see Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hagrid leave Harry on the Dursley's doorstep.
Dudley's best friend Piers Polkiss who comes with Harry and the Dursleys to the zoo is omitted. The snake is changed from a Boa Constrictor to a Burmese Python.
Mrs Figg (who would later appear in the film version of 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix', played by Kathryn Hunter) looking after Harry while Aunt Petunia buys Dudley's Smelting's uniform is omitted.
Uncle Vernon moving Harry to Dudley's second room is eliminated, so we don't know why Harry gets it in the next film.
The scene where Harry and the Dursleys go to a hotel in eliminated, so instead they go straight go to the hut.
Hagrid, after he breaks the hut, mistakes Dudley for Harry, because we know the boy who plays Dudley is called Harry Melling, until Harry corrects him straight away.
The scene where Harry first encounters Malfoy in Madam Malkin's Robe Shop is omitted. The scene where Harry goes back to The Dursleys for the remainder of the Summer Holidays is omitted, because after buying his school things, Hagrid brings him straight to the Platform.
The scene where Malfoy challenges Harry and Ron into a duel in the trophy room at midnight and tipping Flich off is eliminated. So we don't understand why Herimone escorts Harry to the Trophy cabinet and shows him that his father was also a seeker. Also eliminated is Neville when he, Harry, Ron and Herimone first investigate the third floor corridor and first encounter Fluffy.
Even The Nobert story-arc was all a single event: Nobert's egg is revealed, hatches, he is discovered and sent to Romania by Dumbledore, by the next scene, when he is supposed to be given to Ron's brother Charlie who is actually with dragons.
Scenes where Ron is brought to the hospital wing after being bitten by Nobert, Malfoy is brought to Snape's office, and then Harry and Herimone bringing Nobert up the astronomy tower, and caught by Flich, and are brought to Professor McGonagall's office for detention along with Neville are also eliminated, so we don't know why Malfoy spots Harry, Ron and Herimone in Hagrid's hut who get caught by him and Professor McGonagall in the corridor.
Also eliminated are both Ronan and Bane the centaurs who Inform Hagrid about Mars being bright and then later argue with Firenze after he rescues Harry from the hooded figure in the Forbidden Forrest.
The scene where Harry and Herimone enter the Potions table before Harry enters the final room through the purple fire is also eliminated.
The scene where Harry faces Quirrell while touching his skin before he passes out is changed to burning him into ashes causing Voldemort to leave his body.
And lastly, When Harry wakes up in the hospital, he gets a visit from Dumbledore, Ron, Herimone (who both tell him that he missed the final Qudditch match) and Hagrid, who was upset about how he never should have told them how to get past Fluffy, while only in the film Dumbledore tells him that his scar is a mark of love.
Even the ending scene where Harry shares one last goodbye with Ron and Herimone before the Summer holidays start, is omitted, instead ending Harry sharing one final moment with Hagrid who gives him the Photo album, when he should have given him when he had visited him in the Hospital wing, before he departs onto the Hogwarts Express.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is above average but it is a perfect introduction to the Harry Potter films to introduce to the young crowd, if you haven't read the books yet.<br/><br/>Book: 10/10
Film: 5/10"

The young actors have certainly come a long way since this first outing, but this is still an entertaining and endearing experience that's as enchanting as it is exciting. It does a great job of setting up the vibrant 'wizarding world' of which we're all now so familiar, it has some fantastically interesting concepts and well-executed ideas and it is surprisingly funny at times, too. While it may now be perhaps the 'worst' in the series, aside from the 'Fantastic Beasts' spin-off stuff (which doesn't really count, of course), it is still a wonderfully charming and enjoyable ride that's better than most of today's blockbusters. 8/10"

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is taken away from his obnoxious and abusive aunt and uncle and taken to the Hogwarts Academy where he's going to learn to become a wizard. He becomes friends with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). It doesn't take long for Potter to learn about his past as well as what's expected of him in the future.<br/><br/>I'm going to be really honest and admit that I've never read a single line of any of the novels and in all honesty I never really paid too much attention to what they were even about. I'm watching this first film on March 15, 2016 so that's nearly fifteen years since this was released so obviously you can't say I'm a fan of anything involving the characters. I really wasn't sure what to expect going into the movie but by the time the end credits started there's no doubt that I was left entertained.<br/><br/>I thought for the most part this was a pretty entertaining film and I think everyone got it right in regards to the casting. I mean the three leads are all extremely good for their roles and I thought all of them managed to help carry the film. Radcliffe was certainly believable in the role of this master wizard and I thought both Grint and Watson added a lot of charm. Then you've got the likes of John Cleese, Alan Rickman, John Hurt, Maggie Smith and Richard Harris.<br/><br/>I'm not normally a fan of CGI heavy movies but I thought it was perfectly used here and never really took away from the story. Instead of taking away from the story it actually did a very good job at adding to this alternative universe and the various magic that is to be found in it. Technically speaking the film was certainly well made with a ripping score, great effects as well as fine editing and cinematography. If I had to say anything negative about the picture it would be the incredibly long running time."
"EvelynFilmFan","8","1","2","3 February 2016"," This first film in the franchise is a true family film, but never too childish and with scary parts as well.
","In the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry thinks he is""just Harry"". But actually he's a wizard who lives with his hostile uncle, aunt and cousin somewhere just outside London. On one special day he gets a letter, but his mean uncle Vernon Dursley prevents Harry from opening the letter, which results in an invasion of letters to Harry from Hogwarts, school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The friendly half-giant Hagrid saves Harry on his eleventh birthday and brings him to the place where he can buy all the things he needs. After finding a wand and a pet, he goes to the station - platform 9 3/4 to be precise - and hops on the train to Hogwarts. This is where he meets his future best friends: Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. At Hogwarts he meets all the rest of the school, including the teachers and headmaster Dumbledore. He learns all new stuff, find friends but also learns about his past and parents. This first year is also the first time he encounters the most evil wizard of all time: Lord Voldemort, or at least a part of him.<br/><br/>The film where it all started came out in 2001 and shows a very young cast. It's hard not to love all these young actors. The book however, written by J.K. Rowling, was published in 1997. Therefore it already had some kind of fanbase and it was only getting bigger once the film came out. Out of thousands of British children, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were cast as the main character, respectively Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry is 'the boy who lives' and the only person on earth who ever survived a death curse. In contrast to Ron, who comes from a true wizard family, he knows nothing of magic, but his parents were amazing wizards. Hermione on the other hand doesn't have magical parents, but she is very bright and a bit of a know-it-all. Ron and Harry find her quite annoying, but after some crazy event - which includes a troll - they are besties for life! A student from a rival group at school, is Draco Malvoy. Tom Felton plays this white haired bully, who has an evil father, very well!<br/><br/>The other main characters are the school's headmaster Albus Dumbledore, who is played by Richard Harris. Fun fact is, he declined the role at first but a relative of his demanded Harris to play the part. Maggie Smith plays Professor Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant - who has a love for the most disturbing creatures - is played by Robbie Coltrane. One of my favourite characters, Professor Severus Snape, is played by Alan Rickman. His voice and his total appearance is so brilliant, and Snape is also a mysterious character. Nobody knows what he's up to and who he truly is. This year's villain is the stuttering Professor Quirinus Quirrell, who is played by Ian Hart. He is the first one who tries to let Voldemort return. The most amazing thing is that a lot of characters come back every now and then, in every film. Like the family of Harry and Ron, the students, who are all truly a part of this franchise. There might be something else which comes back, sort of. When Harry gets his invisibility cloak, the card says: ""Use it well"". This is the same phrase Professor Horace Slughorn in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Anyone noticed that?? I thought it was brilliant!<br/><br/>The first film is because of the age of the main characters, not that scary. It's all about getting to know the school, the students, teachers and of course magic. However, we also learn a bit about Harry's past and the evil wizard who killed his parents. There are parts - towards the end and the scene in the woods - which would scare me, if I was a child. At least Ron Weasley is scared at those moments, which is sometimes quite funny. Ron also makes comments which makes you laugh, even as an adult. The part where we found out the truth about professor Quirrel, is kind of a plot twist. I can't remember exactly how I thought about that when I saw the film for the first time, but I think it can be a surprise. The soundtrack, composed by John Williams, is one you'll never forget. It's truly brilliant and we should thank Williams for being a part of the film! Actually the whole film looks amazing. Besides the soundtrack, the complete decor, effects and make-up are magnificent. The goblins in the bank for example are very well made. Just think about it that the film is over 10 years old! How would it look when the film was made today. with the latest technique? I can not think it could be any better!<br/><br/>In the first film in the franchise the characters are just starting their new school and learn new things. Because this is the first film, the characters are very young. It's only logic this is more a family film than the latter ones. However it's never too childish and there are in fact some scary parts, but it never gets too dark. The character traits of many already evident: we see who's good and who's bad. The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione is very credible, they are a good fit! It's amazing how this film is the start of en entire franchise, which lasted a decade! Next film in the franchise is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!"

","Harry Potter, arguably one of the most famous book series, didn't take long for to be adapted for the screen.

Odd things happen around him and before long he is told that he's not like other people, he is a wizard and a famous one to boot. He leaves his world of neglect behind and enters the magical world where young wizards of England attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/><br/>With the help of friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), Harry navigates his first year of school with the looming prospect of the dark wizard who killed his parents trying to return to power. <br/><br/>The film has an all-star cast including Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and Alan Smith. Chris Columbus (The Goonies) directs and does a fine job of bringing the magical world to life. <br/><br/>It is definitely worth seeing but be sure not to neglect the books. It would be interesting to see how a Harry Potter miniseries would do, but at the moment we just have the films.

"pierce-declase","7","1","2","17 February 2015"," Enjoyable Movie
","The first of the Harry Potters movie's and its a good a start. I have seen the first film countless of times and i thought after recently watching it, i shall give it a review.<br/><br/>Characters: The characters in Harry Potter are but all significant to the story, characters with larger roles are introduced well, each introduction allows us to form a small connection with them. Considering this is a 8 part series, over time because of these connections it will continue to be built over the movies. Even characters with less significant roles are introduced well. As for the three main characters. We are slowly introduced to both Ron and hermione. Both are introduced in a different way, through these ways we can understand what kind personalty we can expect from characters, the good thing about this trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione is that each character have all there different traits. <br/><br/>Story: The Story is about people who know magic, they use wands to use that magic. Go to school to learn. That is the basic outline of harry potter. Also there are people called muggles who are oblivious to the wizard world. Then there is Harry Potter and how is story is put into all this. Harry loses his parents at a young age to a dark wizard. Harry's parents were also great wizards. Harry is given to his Uncle and Aunt, who are muggles. Harry is bought up as a normal boy who is treated bad. Not knowing anything of his past or parents. That all changes when he finds out his a wizard and goes to hogwarts the school for witches and wizards. During his time Harry will face many challenges. With the background of the story, Harry is destined to find trouble and that's exactly what happens. Its a good start up to the series, we now introduced to the characters we need to know. <br/><br/>Film: The film itself has great visual affects and props. The special affects are good, but have ages slightly but still great. The length of film is not to long or to short. The music has the magic feel and grows on you. The acting was good, specially from the more mature class, considering this film is more on children you can expect that dole acting. I think Daniel at such a young age, even though he suited the role, his acting was not the greatest. He does well enough that it does not impact the film. <br/><br/>Overall: I give this film a 7 star. Its a enjoyable film and great to watch for anyone. If you either see it as a single film or a part of a massive series of films its great to watch. From this beginning we now have the basic back story of the Harry Potter world and now can build of this. The film at times for me did drag or i just did not have interest in that certain part, as the first film of 8 the connections from soon to be an overall plot is a little absent here, but as this is more of an introduction. And that is what i exactly think of the film. I enjoyed the film and is deserves it 7 star rating nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>P.D"

"GeorgeRoots","6","1","2","29 August 2014"," Does The Magic Really Begin Here?
","Seeing as how we have reached the end of this franchise after 10 very enjoyable years, I think it's time to reflect on how well the series will stand the test of time. Upon hearing that they where making a movie adaptation of ""Harry Potter"", I was not really affected. I was 9 years old and unfamiliar with the story. My father had read the books to me here and there, and only after I saw the 4th movie did I really get into this franchise and decided to pick up the books myself.<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage, is set to begin his first year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As he makes close friends and a few enemies, Harry stumbles on a conspiracy and faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents when he was just one year old.<br/><br/>This film is literally a perfect adaptation of the first book, that kind of works and kind of doesn't. With no disrespect to J.K Rowling, who is a fantastic writer, but the adaptation and direction by Chris Columbus is boring. So visually unexciting, you'd be surprised to hear that Terry Gilliam (""Time Bandits"", 1981, ""Brazil"", 1985,) was asked to direct. Seeing Terry's warped, surrealist imagery from his movies really would have been interesting to see how he would have depicted it, however he decided to pass due to studio control. Aside from that, this film is family entertainment at best. I remember watching it as a kid and loving it even more so than ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001). Now I'm much older, I can clearly say that LOTR was definitely better in so many ways. When I see this movie on TV nowadays it hasn't particularly aged well. It's fun in some areas and whimsical, but it's just not really that interesting.<br/><br/>Casting (Mostly for the adults) is great, I'm proud to be British and there's a gigantic amount of stellar choices involved. Alan Rickman as Professor Snape could not have been a better decision, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, John Hurt and Richard Harris's short lived time as Albus Dumbledore all make for a fun time to be had. With that said, what wonderful talent that has been found in Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson. Though I didn't really enjoy them in the first half of the movie, once they fully interact with each other as friends did the film series officially begin.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: For the first story in what would be 7 wonderful reads and 8 enjoyable movies it does well as a first outing, but everything in the later movies is just better polished and rendered. 6/10."

","The day I went to see this movie in the cinema I can remember very well. The film was from 2001 and in those days I was 7, so it was one of the first movie's I saw in cinema. If you are the young you can't remember anything so a movie must make a very good impression on you. If it wants to be good. There was one scene in this first movie that I will never forget. It made such a big impression on me. It was were my love for Harry Potter started. Hogwarts was in a way a safe place for me, and the magic really hit me. And it still does today. This scene that impressed me so much was when the audience could see Hogwarts for the very first time on screen. You just saw this massive castle, in that was so impressive; I actually can't put it into world how enthusiastic I was. The children were sitting in the boats effortlessly and were floating over the water. The castle had something magical and I was sure I would never forget it.<br/><br/>I think this shows that Chris Columbus was a very great Director. He really brought the magic over on screen. I still think Chris Columbus was the best choice to make the first two films. His ambition and his effort were incredible. I have a lot of respect for this man on the way I made this film. And at times it wasn't easy. The biggest part of the casting were children of the age of 11 years old. And he always needed to be calm, never he lost his temper or his patience. He kept holding on to his job. And most important he really wanted it to be good, so if Rowling had any critics he really wanted to change it. Those reasons are for me the reason why he was the best man to do the first two films. I had loved to see him doing the whole series.<br/><br/>But more about that in my review on Film 3: prisoner of Azkaban. People sometimes forget that when they start making these movies they had to start everything. How does it sound when someone waves his wand ? How does the Hogwarts uniform look like ? How does wands look ? Etc. There were so much questions that needed to be answered, I think Chris dealt with that on an incredible way. He is certainly one of my Childhood heroes.<br/><br/>The pressure of the filmmakers was so big especially because of the casting of the characters and the look of the magical world; Hogwarts, Diagon Alley. The fans had certain wishes they really cared about the books and wanted it to be perfect. The filmmakers must have felt this pressure I am almost 100 % sure of that. So David Heyman (producer) and Chris Columbus had to cast the characters and as a fan I couldn't wish for a better casting. I most enjoyed Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore. He did such an impressive job and it is so sad that he died. He was perfect for the role.<br/><br/>That's the same for Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger , Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter. Actually I can go on and say it about the whole casting, because they were perfect. We, fans, had the best cast, the best directors, producers we could wish for in a franchise. And I really can't be more proud than I am now it is over. On the first film those actors did such an amazing job. And David Heyman and Chris Columbus did such an amazing job for the casting.<br/><br/>The storyline is something really important in a film. And I am just not very fond of Steve Kloves. In the first film he surprisingly did a good job and that's why, combined with casting , the first film is one of the best in the series. Sometimes you need to leave your favorite parts of the book and make selection to include only the most important. Steve Kloves did a very good job in the first movie but had of course help of J.K.Rowling. The thing I was a little disappointed about was that some lines that were meant for Ron were said by Hermione. This was because Steve liked the character Hermione. And I think that isn't necessarily at all. Because things characters say can develop characters, or show how characters are. It is very clear that the first movie is a very mysterious film you didn't get the answer immediately. For example when Harry looks at Snape for the first time. On the other hand there is a very good character development not only through the whole series but also in the first movie. Something that belonged in the story was how Prof.Quirrell got in touch with Voldemort ? I mean this is the most important question in the first film and is explained very good in the book. But you didn't hear Voldemort or Quirrell talk about how this happened. How did Voldemort get inside his head ? I rate this film 10/10 just because; as a fan I couldn't wish for a better start of the film series based on those books. I think the movies should never be remade, because Filmmakers will have the right, then to do whatever they want. To change certain things. A lot of remakes went wrong because filmmakers didn't respect the original source of the story. We should respect the effort the directors, the actors and everyone who worked on Harry Potter throughout the series had in this films. I absolutely Believe this story's; the books and this films are Timeless. People of all generations can grow up with this. Although not the same as the original generation. They can grow up with Harry, and watch these films. It was absolutely unforgettable."

","With billions upon billions of pounds in revenue generated from book sales, film adaptations and all other mediums, and with the hysteria surrounding the series now all but gone, it seemed the perfect time to re-visit the Harry Potter film franchise. I'll state outright that I'm a fan of the books: they are hardly ground-breaking pieces of literature, but they are a meticulously crafted and widely imaginative set of novels, maturing with it's progression and with the age of it's characters and readers. The movie adaptations were consistently average, fiercely loyal to J.K. Rowling's prose but always somewhat lacking in substance.<br/><br/>Shut away in the cupboard under the stairs by his adoptive parents (Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw), 11 year-old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives an unhappy life. But there's something different about him, as he learns when he talks to a snake at a zoo and makes the protective glass disappear, causing his vile cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) to fall into the tank. His life changes when he is invited to enroll at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The invitations are burned by the Dursleys, and they go to great lengths to stop him going to a place that will teach him magic, until he is rescued by a hairy giant named Reubus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).<br/><br/>When introduced into the magical world with Hagrid, Harry learns that he is famous. His parents were killed by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort (generally referred to as You-Know-Who), but Harry survived the attack, seemingly killing Voldemort and inflicting Harry with a lightning bolt scar on his forehead. When he gets to Hogwarts, he is befriended by the bumbling Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and the precocious Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the three are quickly embroiled in a plot involving murdered unicorns, a mysterious artefact known as the philosopher's stone, and a giant three-headed dog.<br/><br/>Philosopher's Stone is almost defiantly faithful to the books. Sure, lines are altered here, and minor characters are snipped out there, but this is as close as literally 'bringing a book to life' gets. Yet while this works in it's favour in terms of visualising Rowling's creations, it doesn't even try to develop any ideas of it's own that would have only worked in a visual medium. Much of Rowling's silly and charming sense of humour is lost in simply filming whatever happens on the pages. One of the main criticism's I have for the books is that a lot of the major characters are little more than archetypes, so a lot rested on the three young leads' shoulders in making us interested enough to stick with them.<br/><br/>Sadly, two of the three fall rather flat, with only the gurning and hang-dog Rupert Grint showing a natural gift for appearing on the big screen. Potter is a simple enough character anyway, at least he is at this point of the story, shy, naive but brave, but Radcliffe gives an incredibly one-note performance, encapsulated in the scene in which he discovers he can perform magic. ""I'm a... wizard?"" he says, lacking anything resembling a facial expression. Watson also struggles to bring much likability to her self-satisfied bookworm, her eyebrows constantly rising and falling as she struggles to perform her lines with any conviction.<br/><br/>For the rest of the cast, director Chris Columbus has rounded up a smorgasbord of British and Irish talent, a collection of well-trained thespians who steal the entire film from it's leads. Richard Harris plays Professor Dumbledore, Hogwarts' headmaster, Maggie Smith is Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor, the house Harry is chosen for, Alan Rickman is Professor Snape, Harry's greasy-haired Potions teacher, and John Hurt makes a small appearance as a wand-maker. Coltrane probably steals the film as the beast-loving grounds-keeper Hagrid. It's an amazing line-up that would consistently grow both in talent and in numbers as the films progressed.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a success, weaving an interesting enough story about the possible return of the dark lord Voldemort, with Harry's wide-eyed introduction to the world of hocus pocus. John Williams' Oscar-nominated and now widely recognisable score captures some of the giddy movie magic of early Spielberg, and the attention to detail is often remarkable. But like the book, it ultimately suffers from being too kid-friendly, spoon-feeding lessons in morality without giving much for adults to chew on. It's little more than a well-told children's story, something that would change as the novels became darker and more complex, but at this point, it's a gentle introduction to a captivating world."
"OllieSuave-007","8","1","2","8 February 2014"," Magical fun.
","Based on the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, this is the first film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story about a young boy (Harry Potter) who is rescued from the clutches of a neglectful aunt and uncle and a bratty cousin, and taken to study witchcraft at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he meets his future lifelong friends Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger, witches Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall and the school's all-powerful headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. Harry also learns about his connection with the evil dark lord, Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>I think this movie followed the J.K. Rowling's novel very well, including in it most details that capture the imagination, magic, adventure and drama of the story. Director Christopher Columbus and the team of writers and special effects people gave a pretty entertaining and believable movie. And, the acting was spot-on, most notably the brilliance of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Richard Harris. The rivalry between the school houses Gryffindor and Slytherin were tastefully depicted; I just wished the other two houses, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were emphasized a little more. I didn't care too much for the Quidditch match, as I thought it was a long-drawn out ballgame.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good introduction for the film series and I think is one of the best in the series as well.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

","Harry Potter, a seemingly normal 11 year old boy soon discovers that there is far more to the world and himself then he ever imagined. Famous for an incident at his birth he soon discovers the world of magic as he is invited and attends Hogwarts, a school for witchcraft and wizardry. While there he learns that not all wizards are those to be trusted and there are those still serve an old evil, an old evil that wants Harry Potter dead.<br/><br/>Based off the acclaimed series by J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus directs the first of the series. Touching, heartfelt and innocent is one way to describe the first of the series, lighthearted in its enjoyment and in its scope, one feels after watching this film that they've barely scraped the surface of the world of magic and muggles and one would be right in making that assessment. John Williams scores the film beautifully and the entire score itself feels like a part of the magic that is this film. The child actors mainly Radcliffe, Grint and Watson do a marvelous job and the chemistry between the three cant be denied by the viewer at at any point. Alan Rickman, who plays the sinister Snape is wonderful in his role and is easily one of the many who do a wonderful job within the film. The late Richard Harris also does a magnificent job as does Maggie Smith. One cant help but be inexplicably drawn to the film, it almost feels as though you are let in on a secret, one in which you are glad to be a part of. While some would argue that the first of the series is perhaps a bit to childish in its nature, i disagree and say it is the most care free of the series, a good introduction piece into a series that only gets darker and more adult as they go. For any fan of fantasy, or any fan of film in general the first Harry Potter film is a true gem and one I'm glad to have watched."
"stefan_willa","5","1","2","11 January 2013"," Superficial and a lot of missed opportunities
","Basically, a film about a bestseller such as Harry Potter would have a lot of potential, if it would be directed as careful as the novel. Unfortunately, the narrative techniques of J.K.Rowling are not applied in the movie at all, although this would be quite easy to do.<br/><br/>There are several markers of carelessness in the movie. Firstly, the characters are weakly introduced, if at all. The worst example is the appearance of Firenze, the Centaur in the forbidden forest. He appears for the first time to save Harry from Voldemort, but Harry reacts as he would have known Centaurs for a long time and is not shy or fearful at all. This does not make much sense, considering that it is his first year in the world of magic. Secondly, the narrative thread is not very consequent. As a spectator, the narration seems to jump between only loosely connected scenes, which in my opinion does not allow to understand everything, unless you have read the book. An example for this is the flying lesson with Madam Hooch. Harry breaks the rules there, and he is caught by McGonagall. But the audience does not learn why Harry is not worried too much as he follows McGonagall, especially if you consider that he is supposed do be excluded from Hogwarts. This lack of narrative skills by the director shines through the whole movie, as you may find unfortunately many other examples such as this.<br/><br/>What I thought positive about the movie was the cast of actors and the theme music, although overused. I still believe it is not really a children's book, but the movie certainly is targeting children, which may be another reason for the superficiality and carelessness mentioned above."
"Dannov747","7","1","2","5 December 2012"," Christopher Columbus does a fantastic job of bringing the books to life
","The first Harry Potter movie is also one of the best in the series, partly because it sticks to it's source material. Columbus doesn't try to condense the movie to make it more appealing to non-fans but instead pleases the already enormous Harry Potter fanbase with a faithful rendition of the HP world. <br/><br/>Columbus should get much praise for the focus on the movie's setting. None of the sequels ever brought Diagon Alley or Hogwarts to life like this movie did. The movie is indeed aimed more towards the hardcore book fans, and perhaps, children, then adults and non-fans. Several parts that could have been skipped were still included to please fans, and the Sorcerer's Stone almost never strayed from it's source material. Scenes like the quidditch scene were not particularly relevant, but helped build the setting and definitely pleased the audience.<br/><br/>The casting is great, fans found Hagrid and Dumbledore to be exactly how they imagined them. While Alan Rickman was probably not the Snape described in the books, he does brilliantly. As for the child actors, I've seen better, but they did their job's solidly. The soundtrack is easily the best in the series.<br/><br/>Overall the Sorcerer's Stone is a great foundation for the series. It's too bad that later installments strayed so much from the tried and true formula that worked here.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Here's an event movie that holds up to being an event. This filmed version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, adapted from the wildly popular book by J.K. Rowling, stunningly brings to life Harry Potter's world of Hogwarts, the school for young witches and wizards. The film is the first installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman. It features Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, with Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, John Cleese, and Fiona Shaw co-star to play key supporting roles.It was directed by Chris Columbus. <br/><br/>The story follows Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts as he discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his magical education. Upon his 11th birthday, Harry Potter, who lives in misery with an aunt and uncle that don't want him, learns from a giant named Hagrid that he is the orphaned son of powerful wizards. Harry is offered a place at prestigious Hogwarts, a boarding school for wizards that exists in a realm of magic and fantasy outside the dreary existence of normal humans or ""Muggles."" At Hogwarts, Harry quickly makes new friends and begins piecing together the mystery of his parents' deaths, which appear not to have been accidental after all. <br/><br/>Being so faithful to the book is both the movie's strength and weakness. The movie unfolds exactly as written in the book, so there is little room for surprises or discoveries.The greatest strength of the film comes from its faithfulness to the novel, and this new cinematic world is filled with all the details of Rowling's imagination, thanks to exuberant sets, elaborate costumes, clever makeup and visual effects, and a crème de la crème cast.A combination of computer graphics, detailed sets, and real-life locations gives the film the authenticity its fans expect.The second-half adventure doesn't translate perfectly from page to screen, ultimately because of the film's fidelity to the novel.This is a case of making a movie for the book's fans, as opposed to a transcending film. Writer Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus keep the spooks in check, making this a true family film, and with its resourceful hero wide-eyed and ready, one can't wait for Harry's return.But nevertheless,it still manages to be a complete triumph for it is a near-perfect commercial and cultural commodity."

"cooke08","10","1","2","12 December 2011"," Breathtaking Effects and Excellent Characters
","The Sorcerer's Stone was an excellent introduction to the Harry Potter series. The main focus for this film was the development of the characters. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter could not have been better casted; he not only did a phenomenal job but also made the character come to life. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who played Ron and Hermione were also wonderful throughout the whole film. The other characters such as Dumbledore, Hagrid, and McGonagall may play smaller parts however they are no less impressive. Along with the characters, this film also introduces Hogwarts, which was an unbelievable creation. The journey for the three children into Hogwarts and into each other's lives was very well done.<br/><br/>I feel an element which adds a lot of character to the film is its use of lighting. The scenes inside of Hogwarts are lit by candlelight, torches, and oil lamps which gives them a very old world ambiance. Although the scenes were darker, this use of lighting allows the audience a truer look into how Hogwarts would have been.<br/><br/>Once everyone is properly introduced to the audience, the plot shifts from character development to the story of Harry's, Hermione's, and Ron's search for the Sorcerer's Stone. As the children explore Hogwarts and search for the truth it is important to see how the characters react to conflict and how it continually builds the storyline. This is also important due to the fact that it is the first movie in the series and is setting the groundwork for those that follow. <br/><br/>The next movie in the series Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, followed in the footsteps of its predecessor. It continues to develop the characters and helps to form an even deeper emotional attachment between them and the audience. The theme continues not only throughout the first film but all of those that follow. This made these films almost an addiction to the viewers, everyone who watches has a genuine concern for all of the characters and a curiosity about what will happen next. <br/><br/>The unifying central concerns for this film were both characters and plot; both of these were equally important for the film as a whole. Together they created one of the most acclaimed family films of our time."

I was six years old, still a little young, but I didn't want to read anything else, I wanted to discover more. And I did.

","Like it or leave it, J.K. Rowling created a hugely successful world, realised through her vivid imagination and highly accessible writing style. Derived from these was a trifecta of blockbuster potential and surely enough, we are five, nearly six, films through her saga. The box office figures have been inevitable given the legion of devoted fans and the obligation of the studios to provide at least worthy on-screen fare. Potter was not a thing to be squandered. <br/><br/>Philosopher's Stone is a reasonable movie. Under Columbus' guidance the world is ably recreated visually, and he delivers you through it competently and with adequate faith to the novel. The now iconic score has well served its purpose, being both catchy and synonymous to the Potter franchise. <br/><br/>The adult performances are widely superb, although as many terms like admirable or gutsy you would care to submit, the child performances, protagonists included, are.. child performances. Selected heavily on appearance, the young, inexperienced cast are thrown into the deep end and frequently stumble. But there are six more films for them to grow as actors.<br/><br/>All in all, it suffers from a lack of ambition, perhaps a symptom of Rowling having provided a great deal of the vision already. At face value the film is sufficiently entertaining but little of it exceeds expectations when compared to the imagination of the reader. This disappoints given the opportunity for a true epic in nature, not just in run-time. The first instalment also begins the tradition of blisteringly, painfully cheesy endings.

","I'm in a rather embarrassing position when it comes to the world of Harry Potter. I'd never heard of the books, much less read any until the films came out. Shows how unaffected I was by the whole Potter phenomenon. JK Rowling's tales of a boy wizard at a magic school is one of the most amazing things to hit the world of children's fiction since Roald Dahl was alive and kicking.<br/><br/>But what I'm about to say will probably incur the wrath of everyone on this site. What exactly is all the fuss about Harry Potter? I've taken the time to read the books, and I can't say there's anything special about them. Rowling's writing is adequate. But there's nothing in her words that truly comes alive. The characters are flat. They're not at all memorable. And despite the setting of a magic school, the books are not very...well...magical.<br/><br/>I get the impression JK Rowling wants to be another Roald Dahl or a Terry Pratchett. But she doesn't have Pratchett's rich imagination, nor Dahl's wicked humour. What she has is a very simplistic view of the world, where people are split into two camps. Good vs bad. And the stilted, one-dimensionality of her writing ensures the outcome is never in any doubt. That her books have entranced so many people is the one real act of magic they've had. I can't explain they're success. <br/><br/>When Warner Bros bought the rights to the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the result was a runaway sensation. Between it and The Lord of the Rings, they rekindled fantasy film-making in a major way. But the film had the unfortunate luck of having Chris Columbus as its director. He's as bland a director as Rowling is as a writer. I would have preferred to see the film directed by Terry Gilliam, which was the plan at one point. He could have brought a real enchanting magic to it.<br/><br/>But under Columbus' hand, the film is just banal. Its not all his fault. He has Rowling's writing to go from after all. But that's largely the problem with the film. He's too faithful to the book. Another complaint I have of JK Rowling is she's not too adept when it comes to plot. The Philosopher's Stone works as a slowly unfolding mystery, but when examined closely, there are plot holes everywhere, as if she didn't know herself. The characters perform some extraordinary leaps of deductive reasoning. But its reasoning that doesn't always ring true.<br/><br/>Columbus tries to hide this deficiency by overkilling the film with extravagant sets and special effects, hoping you won't notice. He even has John Williams contribute a blaring musical score as a backup in case the set design fails. But the main problem I have with Harry Potter is he's not much of a hero. It seems to have escaped the notice of many, but Harry has a lot of his victories given to him. For example, he's given the broom for the Quidditch match. He gets the Invisibilty Cloak handed to him from an unknown source that is never explained. And a lot of the times when he's in danger, he's often bailed out by Hermione Granger. She saves him from falling off his broom. She comes up with the method to defeat the Ogre and Devil's Snare. And the Philosopher's Stone just magically lands in Harry's lap.<br/><br/>Harry is worshipped at Hogwarts because he survived an encounter with Voldemort, the wickedest wizard of them all, but his reputation seems entirely unfounded. Another thing that annoys me about JK Rowling is the way she telegraphs plot developments well in advance. You know that learning to ride a broom will be integral to the plot later on in the story. And so will the Invisibility Cloak.<br/><br/>One positive aspect about the Harry Potter series is the insistence on an all British cast. It may have American backing, but there's not a single American to be found in front of the camera. The film has some of Britain's finest veterans, including Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagle and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. We even have Robbie Coltrane who makes a wonderful Hagrid, and cameos from John Hurt, John Cleese and Julie Walters. More importantly, there's a real British feel to the film. Columbus does a fine job of making Hogwarts akin to a boarding school. The common rooms, dorms and rival Houses are all present and correct.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are a precocious lot, but they fill out their roles nicely enough. But the cast is really the film's only saving grace. The rest is not especially brilliant. Surprisingly, even with the backing of The Jim Henson Company, a lot of the effects in the film are rather poor. The centaur and Fluffy the three headed dog are obviously just CGI. The whole Quidditch match is clearly happening in front of blue screens instead of actual backdrops. The artificiality of the film completely cancels out any magic.<br/><br/>As things draw to a close, the film becomes something akin to an Indiana Jones adventure. Fluffy, vines, and the flying keys are all a bit lacklustre, but the gigantic chess set is impressive. In fact its the best bit in the whole film. Harry, Ron and Hermione have to play their way across a vast chess game to get to the Philosopher's Stone. Its very gripping, and helped no end by the edgy music score. Much more exciting then the much more famous Quidditch match.<br/><br/>But the film is almost certainly overrated. Just like the books. Its hard to get worked up because Rowling's writing is so unimaginative. There's nothing strikingly original about the world of Harry Potter, and the heroes and villains are just walking clichés. A poor start to a progressively better series."

","This film is none other than the awful copy of the lord of the rings and Chronicles of Narnia. E 'un film certainly derivative, was given the opportunity to write yet another bullshit that the lord of the rings is overvalued, I would say the opposite, Harry potter is a novel for children tremendously overvalued. After the lord of the rings is the novel for excellence and fantasy film series has had more than 13 Oscar. It's a excellent series. then the criticism written by ignorant idiot can be quite clear, are the usual senseless words of those who took up with the moon across. It 'a film that has a great relationship with the occult and magic and has a few meanings and moral lessons suitable for the growth of children. Punta much about these schools for Maghetti really irritating and disturbing. It 'a film for children, with no spectacular worthy of note and I know a lack narrative in the film. The criticism she has received are justified and fair, a film is terribly derivative and constitutes one of the bases levels of film fantasy films."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","2","6 June 2008"," A decent start of the series but also clearly one of the lesser Harry Potter movies.
","No, I'm not a big Harry Potter fan and probably never will be but I can appreciate the qualities of the movies. Definitely for a children movie this movie is of course of very high class, with fabulous looking sets, a whole load of well known British actors and an highly experienced crew involved.<br/><br/>The movie forms a nice first set up for the future series of Harry Potter movies. Still I'm glad the movies and its characters have matured a lot since this movie. Probably also has to do with the fact that this movie and the second were directed by Chris Columbus who is an experienced children movie director, while the other Harry Potter movies were directed by more 'serious' directors. Yes, it makes this movie a good children's movie to watch but also sort of makes this movie look and feel more outdated than any of the other Harry Potter movies, which also goes at the expense of its re-watchable value.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" remains good quality- and fun film. It knows to create an entire new world of its own with lots of often strange characters in it.<br/><br/>The movie is of course a set up and the first establishment of a long running series of movies. This means that the movie consists for a big part out of character introductions. Yes, this results in the fact that there are a bit too many characters in the movie, also since some of them don't even seem to serve a purpose at all for the story but this got resolved in the later movies, by simply leaving out some characters but by introducing many new ones as well. So its sort of problem solving with another problem. <br/><br/>Also a bit of a shame that the movie is lacking a real central villain. Professor Snape is treated as a villain, even though we learn by the end of the movie that he's not such a bad guy after all. The real main villain if the movie is of course Voldemort but he gets mostly only mentioned by name and basically doesn't do an awful lot in the movie and only sort of shows up in the very end of the movie. Not the way to treat a villain in my opinion, even though its of course clear from this movie on that he is going to play a much bigger and more important role in the future Harry Potter movies. I however in a case like this feel that they should had putted in a new and different villain besides Voldemort, since this movie is definitely lacking a sense of danger, excitement and action, even though the movie never bores, despite its quite long running time (for a children's movie anyway.).<br/><br/>The movie its quality is also surely being uplifted by its presence of well known and respected actors, such as Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman among many others. Each of them are giving fine performances but it are mostly Harris and Rickman that catch the eye with their performances. The child actors are also managing fine, although its definitely and luckily true that their acting improved throughout during the later movies.<br/><br/>The movie is great looking and knows to create a magic new world, with its set, costumes and make-up. It's not hard to see that this was a costly movie to make. The special effects are also mostly fine, though not really during the game of quidditch, or any other 'flying' sequence for that matter. The movie gets also greatly supported by the musical score from John Williams. Sort of a waste for the series that Williams only scored the music for the first 3 movies.<br/><br/>A good and fun enough start of the series, though luckily the movies improved more over the years.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"cwrdlylyn","7","1","2","19 May 2006"," SORCERER'S STONE : An Underwhelming But Adequate Kick-Off To The Franchise...
","HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERER'S STONE <br/><br/>The first film in the blockbuster ""Harry Potter"" franchise has suffered by comparison to all the films that have come out since. With each HARRY POTTER film that is released, the films seem to become more fully stylized. They've also managed to become far more organic than SORCERER'S STONE... which now comes across gimmicky and elementary by comparison.<br/><br/>HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERER'S STONE tells the very introductory story of Harry's first year at Hogwarts where he only begins to discover the secrets of his hidden past and the complicated inner-workings of his new home. By nature, this is a more simplistic and superficial story then the recent films (GOBLET OF FIRE & PRISONER OF AZKABAN). It doesn't really delve into the histories of the characters and more so acts as an extended introduction.<br/><br/>Though this first film has it's strengths, it's clear it was hurt by the direction of Christopher Columbus. The special effects are impressive still and the story is still compelling, but Columbus' packaging still manages to make things drag at times. While the story could have merited a 2 1/2 hour running time, unfortunately the film Columbus directed does not. The film could have been more tightly constructed and come in under 2 hours... leaving it with a brisker pace.<br/><br/>The children's performances' are adequate. As a matter of fact, for me personally, the only aspect of this franchise that has not improved with age so much is the capabilities of the young actors in the central roles. While I have always enjoyed Rupert Grint's performance as Ron Weasley, I have always found Daniel Radcliffe's Harry and Emma Watson's Hermoine to be a little underwhelming. However, at such young ages as the children were while making this film... they do a passable job.<br/><br/>The real energy and joy of this first film though comes from the energy and sheer excitement invested into the lesser supporting roles. By gathering the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Fionnulla Shaw, and many others... the film has handfuls of fully realized and wildly imaginative supporting players adorning the screen at all times. Their performances along with the action sequences (the final rescue of the Sorcerer's Stone, the Quidditch Match, etc.) are what manage to keep the audience's attention despite the poor direction from Christopher Columbus.<br/><br/>Overall, though this film is a slight disappointment considering the phenomenal material it's based on... it's not a complete mess. It's still entertaining (if overlong) and most importantly, it does leave you anxious to find out what more happens to these characters. As a stand-alone film HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERER'S STONE has many flaws... but it successfully grabs it's audience and leaves them wanting more. Thanks to this quality, the film kick-started a film franchise that only improves with age.<br/><br/>... B- ..."

"Hellrazr360","7","1","2","4 February 2006"," The Magic Comes To Life, In A Bit Of A Dull Way
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had a lot to live up to as a book-to-film adaptation. For-the-most-part, the movie delivers as being entertaining, but any fans wanting more than a passing movie might be disappointed.<br/><br/>The story of this movie of course revolves around Harry Potter, his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. In this movie Harry just turns eleven and suddenly discovers he's a wizard, and probably the most famous one at that. More details are revealed in the movie about Harry's past but I won't spoil them for those who have yet to experience the books or movies of Potter.<br/><br/>As far as being a loyal translation, Columbus does an excellent job. Yes, plenty from the book is left out of the movie but all the vital moments are in the movie. The moments that did make it to the movie are very loyal to the book, almost too loyal. While I give Columbus credit to making the movie loyal it's just too confined, not just for the young actors in the movie but the impact on the audience as well. It's this that makes Sorcerer's Stone no more than a worthy and passing effort by Columbus.<br/><br/>The young actors that play as Harry, Ron and Hermione are all perfect picks by Columbus, which is definitely a plus. Radcliffe as Potter is a great selection as is Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. But Emma Watson proves as the most creditable selection and as the most mature of the young trio. Surprisingly, the actors and actresses that play the professors do a better job than our three young heroes. Not only are the selections for the professors perfect, but they add a great flair to their roles that make them seem even better for their role.<br/><br/>The presentation of Sorcerer's Stone is magical, no doubt, a great movie for the holidays, but it just isn't enough. The movie is fairly long, at over two hours and for some it will seem as if the film drags on too much. While the translation of the teachers, students and plot of the book is done very nicely it's how everything else is executed where the movie falls apart too. Yes, the final tasks near the end of the movie and the Quidditch match are fun to watch but far from stunning.<br/><br/>The result in Sorcerer's Stone is that it's a good movie through and through, but people, especially fans of the books like myself will feel let down by the movie. Now, this isn't a bad movie, there's lots to love in the film's magical flair from the introduction of the students, teachers and other cast members that make appearances in later films. But, if you're expecting a movie that will dazzle you then you're asking for too much of the movie."

"Son_of_Mansfield","7","1","2","6 March 2005"," Harry Potter and the Removal of Substance
","It is a common practice when adapting a book to condense the book, removing anything that is unimportant. However, how can you you tell what will and will not be important when a series isn't even completely written yet? There are so many short cuts taken in this movie, little scenes and bits of dialogue taken out that you lose a sense of coherence. The characters have been simplified as well, giving us bland versions of the characters in the books. I saw this movie before reading the books and wasn't impressed. I took an interest after the second film, which is more faithful and adds some depth. This is just bright, shiny, and simple. Having said that though, the story is so good that even simplified it still works. The special effects, especially the troll, are not up to par for a major studio movie. The cast is quite good, littered with strong, veteran actors to back up the young leads. The leads are not as great in this film as they are in the sequel with a film under their belts. All in all a good effort, but the screenwriter should have stayed closer to the characters in the book and the tone of the film is light. The humor of the book is almost completely torn apart. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban are better movies."
"sadrec1","4","1","2","31 January 2005"," The book is superior
","I saw the film in summer 2002 on video, and have recently read through the entire series in less than a month. Upon reading the Philosopher's Stone, I learned how the film doesn't match up the this great book. Several characters are diminished or removed. The sorting hat sequence is shown to be much shorter as well. Yes, Susan and Draco's sorting is shown, but Lavender, Millicent and Neville are left out. Are there only five first years coming to Hogwarts this year? Are the others sorted privately? At the end of this sequence, Dumbledore's ""Few short words"" are sadly absent. Fred,George and Percy's parts are reduced and Bill is absent, leaving Norbert to be taken quietly and mysteriously during a scene change. Lee Jordan is cast much too young and basically becomes ""Quidditch Announcer boy,"" and his ad-libbed commentary is gone. Countless other changes are made to reduce time, yes, but rather sloppily. At times I could tell it was a Chris Columbus film. How about Harry and the gang screaming Kevin-style at the sight of Fluffy, or the lackluster job at adapting the British humor? As for the casting, most of it is well done, with some exceptions. Daniel Radcliffe is OK as Harry, but Rupert Grint's Ron isn't too great. Emma Watson is one of the prettiest child actresses I can think of, but therein lies the problem. I envision Hermione to be a bit of a weird cross between Asimov's Susan Calvin (plain, shy and book-smart) and Alexander's Elionwy (pretty, VERY talkative and oddly intelligent), having tiny bits of each. She's decent looking, but not as much as, say, Parvati or Lavender. She's a buck-tooth, remember. John Cleese's Nearly Headless Nick is poorly adapted, but he strangely receives top billing. All in all, it's better for those who have read the books. Prisoner of Azkaban is said to be a bit more accessible. I have yet to see this... I now wait for July and November."

This induced a total sense of deja vu (""Oh, it's John Cleese AGAIN, Julie Walters AGAIN! Maggie Smith AGAIN! Alan Rickman, AGAIN!!! yawn yawn) and made the characters less believable by giving you the impression you were watching over-exposed actors, dressed up.<br/><br/>The one noticeable exception in this regard was Robbie Coltrane who was totally believable as Hagrid - in fact, when I first read the book I imagined Robbie Coltrane in this part. Well done mate!<br/><br/>When I become a famous film-director, I shall cast unknowns so the audience can actually get involved in a story, and not feel like hapless bystanders at some self-congratulatory BAFTA night.

It has its high points and those high points are very enjoyable, but the low points almost completely make up for them. The fact I would assume is that the fun comes from the imagination of J K Rowling in her books rather than the film-makers, and unlike such great children's book adaptations as Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory or even Mary Poppins, the film doesn't seem to add anything enjoyable to the story. It's just fun to see the book come to life on the screen.<br/><br/>Personally I'm not much of a fan of the three main actors. Daniel Radcliffe overacts all his pleasant emotions and underacts all his negative emotions while Emma Watson really needs to cut out the exaggerated head movements. Rupert Grint is a shade better, he has a certain credibility in his performance and should really get more credit. He's a touch above your average child actor.<br/><br/>The biggest fun for me is all the great actor cameos from the likes of John Cleese, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt and, of course, Richard Harris as Dumbledore. They are definitely the highlight of an otherwise hammy cast.<br/><br/>Overall the plot is fairly well-driven and the special effects are nicely handled. John Williams' musical score complements the action well and the script, while presumably taken almost straight from the book, is good, but not great. For non-lovers of the books, it's fun, but nothing more. *** / *****"
"IsisStar","3","1","2","29 January 2002"," Could have been worse...
","I very much disliked this movie. Yes, it could have been worse (the opinion that made my sister elbow me in the stomach), but I don't know how much. As a movie it wasn't that bad at all, but as a movie based on a book? No. While they did stick to the story better than they could have, it still wasn't very good. They left out parts, added parts, moved parts around...<br/><br/>I don't think that they should have messed around with these books in the first place. Wasn't everyone making a big deal about how the Harry Potter series was bringing people AWAY from movies and television? Getting them more into books? That's a GOOD thing. And then they go and make it into a movie. In twenty years, what do you think the kids will go for? The Harry Potter books, or the Harry Potter movies? I would much prefer to see some good books in the hands of children than see them staring at a television screen for hours on end. Yes, I myself watch plenty of television and movies, but I could easily live without them, and keep quite entertained, as long as I could read good books.<br/><br/>I, personally, do not plan on seeing any more Harry Potter movies, unless my older sister drags me to them, too. I don't want the Harry Potter experience ruined for me any more than it already has been.<br/><br/>While this is only my opinion, and I know many people love this movie, I can only say one good thing about it: The soundtrack wasn't half bad."

"ayric","4","1","2","21 December 2001"," Don't Believe the Hype!
","I have not read the books. I was under the impression that the books were for children, but after noticing that many adults were reading them I had to ask someone. I was told the books were sort of like Star Wars - highly accessible for adults. Well, the film is definitely sort of like Episode I. It is made for kids, and I do not find it particularly accessible for adults. <br/><br/>There are some great effects in this movie, but that is not enough to keep the attention. As the film moves on it becomes uninteresting and quite boring. I am sure most kids will love this, but the filmmakers should have included more intelligence in the fun, like Disney is a prime example of.<br/><br/>
The mistakes are plentiful and the story does not take form before 90 minutes have passed. That is when the Sorcerer's Stone is even mentioned for the first time. This is a safe sign that the 152 minutes make an unnecessarily long movie. <br/><br/>The biggest problem of the film is, however, the cast. The complete kid part of the cast (excluding Watson) is completely without charisma. These kids are as uncharming as they come, and I cannot believe how Radcliffe could be chosen to carry a film of these proportions.<br/><br/>One positive thing I have to mention is a very cool chess game with living pieces. Not worth the ticket though.<br/><br/>Rating: 4/10"
"waitingforgodot-1","3","1","2","10 December 2001"," Long, pointless and boring!
","This film was way too long, especially for a children's film. The quality of acting was low, however only for the child actors. The cast included well-known names whom I felt could have done a lot better in other films. I was bored after the first hour and was waiting for the film to get onto a point...but it didn't come at all! However, considering my own choice in movies, which is completely different, others with me seemed to enjoy the movie from beginning to end as a magical experience filled with enchantment and adventure."
"Doylenf","Null","1","2","4 December 2001"," Lacks emotional warmth of ""ET""...a John Williams letdown...
","I was drawn into the story the moment the letters started whirling through the air to ""the boy under the cupboard"" and to the amusing trio (Aunt, Uncle, brother) that give interest to the early scenes and make you anxious for Harry to escape life in this demented household. And from the opening scene on, the special effects are nothing short of marvelous despite what some ""critics"" here are calling ""cheesy"" -- I'm sure the film is a strong contender in that category for a Best Special Effects Oscar.<br/><br/>Having said that--and not being a fan of Dragons and Dungeons, etc. kind of games--my only disappointment was that most of the ""magic"" was too much on the dark side--without enough humor to keep things in a lighter vein for the most part. If this is what kids like, they'll love being scared time and time again by some of the creatures and situations.<br/><br/>I have only praise for the performances, although I agree that Daniel Radcliffe seems to only have two expressions and is indeed bland, but appealing enough, as Harry. Everyone else does their best to bring the characters to life--especially Maggie Smith as head witch and Alan Rickman as Snapes. I think his is the film's outstanding performance.<br/><br/>I was aware of too much exposition in the film (to explain to those of us who haven't read the book what Muggles are, etc.) but I'm sure this sort of thing will diminish when the series continues. I was disappointed by the John Williams score, relentless throughout with only one jaunty theme worth remembering.  <br/><br/>This was made even more obvious by the fact that a trailer for the upcoming re-release of ""ET"" emphasized the difference between his ""ET"" score and the one he wrote for ""Harry Potter"". Obviously, he had much more of an emotional connection to the characters in ""ET"" than was possible for him to have with the characters here. There is no such connection to the characters in this relentlessly busy score.<br/><br/>Even Potter's farewell scene before boarding the train for home, lacks the emotional warmth so strongly suggested in ""ET"" -- a factor that makes the entire movie seem a one-dimensional but highly competent version of a beloved book. All of the set pieces are extraordinarily detailed and well executed, including the Chess Game--and there's a nice plot twist toward the end that I won't reveal here. All in all, a good film version of the book which I understand is remarkably faithful to the novel--and don't let anyone tell you the special effects are anything less than superb!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a John Williams letdown. I'm sure Daniel Radcliffe--who is physically perfect for the role--will improve in his bystander reactions. After all, he made a wonderful 'David Copperfield' on PBS not long ago. Despite some drawbacks, looking forward to the next visualization of Potter's adventures.<br/><br/>The film is known in England and many other countries abroad as ""...and the Philosopher's Stone"".  Frankly, I think the American title is more suitable as it implies ""witchcraft"" which is the very essence of the story. With the U.K. constantly changing American film titles, it's not surprising at all that we sometimes do the same thing. Apparently, we don't really speak the same language!"
"jimbob_nicholls","4","1","2","1 December 2001"," Mediocre acting makes for an average movie
","To be frank, I was disappointed with this movie.<br/><br/>Possible spoilers included (not plot, only character portrayals)<br/><br/>Having read all the books, and having heard all the claims that Columbus had stuck faithfully to the book, Rowlings crying when she first saw it etc. I was looking forward to it. Problem is, much of the book was missing, and what was included seemed to jump from place to place - if you haven't read it (and I'm sure some people out there fall into this category) then you're going to be horribly confused. Much of the important background information just isn't in the movie and, at times, I heard people whispering ""What about...?"" or ""What happened to...?"".<br/><br/>What did impress me, though, were the lavish sets, some of the special effects (floating candles, troll, parts of the Quidditch match), and most of the adult actors. Robbie Coltrane exceeded my expectations. I still struggle with Rickman, fine actor that he is, as Snape though - Jeremy Irons anyone???<br/><br/>As for the four playing Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and Draco - it was there that the movie is essentially ruined. Harry comes across as a self-righteous little prep-school upstart whose attempts to be assertive and tough look like he's acting in the school play - and don't get me started on his inanely cheesy smile. Ron, probably the best of the four, was too perpetually anxious for me, not the cheeky troublemaker of the books. He must have had a special script ""Ron says his line, and looks worried; Ron looks worried and then looks more worried"". Hermoine annoyed me constantly. She was arrogant, self-righteous, superior, her script must've said - ""Hermoine says line then looks at the camera through her nose"". Draco, in the books, isn't a skinny little wimp with a bad haircut - that's Harry! In summary, these actors looked prompted and over-emphasised their expressions of surprise, excitement, and worry (but only when they weren't impersonating planks of wood).<br/><br/>Anyway, I read the books and then went and saw the first of the summer (well, here anyway) blockbusters. Now I have not doubt that despite Harry Potter setting all the records, Lord of the Rings will be around a lot longer (and hopefully break a few recently recorded records along the way). Bring it on I say.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - 6/10"
"PGfan","Null","1","2","12 November 2001"," Wow!! :)

"goody2shoes1344","Null","1","2","25 November 2001"," I don't know if it was what I thought it would be.
","I was somewhat disappointed in the movie. I don't think they did a great job making it as magical as it should be. I think they could have put a little more effort in making the Quidditch match, and spells seem a little more real, and not look so computer-animated.<br/><br/>Actually, I really didn't want a movie made at all. The Harry Potter books were the one series that brought kids AWAY from the television, and allowing them to use their imaginations. All the movie is doing is saying, ""Come back, and watch TV more. Let us create an image of everything so there is no room for your own creativity.""<br/><br/>I also thought that the actors could have a little more expression in their faces. Just as an example, when ""Hermione"" was being cornered by the troll, she looked as if she was just simply looking into the face of her mother or something. If a creature that huge was looking down at me, I know I would have a horrified look on my face. I'm not criticizing the actors, maybe the crew didn't do that well.<br/><br/>I must say I was very disappointed in the end of the movie. My favorite part was when ""Hermione"" figured out the complicated riddle of potions, but that was missing in the movie!! I think they added too much not-so-important-scenes and took out too many important scenes. How did they suddenly get from one chamber to the last one? I wasn't too happy with the movie, and I don't think I will see the others. I'm sticking to the books."

","Crikey,<br/><br/>Very disappointing. Boring (way too long). Bland; really *dull* stuff. Special effects were *awful*; isn't this supposed to be a big budget blockbuster? -- everytime any SFX or stunt is on the screen everything goes blurred and the characters are replaced with _terrible_ CGI dummies that aren't even animated with any degree of competency.<br/><br/>The kids' acting is pretty bad (Harry is very wooden) -- and some of the bit part kids are just plain embarassing.<br/><br/>Really can't be motivated to say any more or to put any more effort into this review.<br/><br/>To summarise, this film really, really bored me -- it's photography, acting and general craftsmanship was _low_.

","I saw ""Harry Potter"" on Thanksgiving Day. My family and dinner guests were really looking forward to seeing this movie. I'd bought tickets as soon as they'd gone on sale to make sure that we'd be able to get seats on this very special American holiday.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, or not, none of us had read any of the ""Harry Potter"" books and didn't know exactly what to expect. We just assumed that the movie would be a delightful fantasy. Were we ever wrong! I don't believe I've ever seen a movie that no one in our group liked--no one at all. You'd think that one of us would have liked it--we're all movie fans who attend one or more movies a week.<br/><br/>To ""Harry Potter"" novices, the film presented itself as no more than a series of linear events. None of us felt that we knew Harry or his friends and none of us developed an emotional bond with any of the characters. I wish we'd enjoyed it. We all wanted to, but nothing in the story's development drew us into the film. However well-intentioned, the movie was meaningless to us.<br/><br/>I'm really glad that so many families and children have a well-crafted movie to see. It's very nice to see so many families in the theater together.<br/><br/>I do hope, however, that you enjoy this movie. Obviously, a movie that attracts so much positive attention can't be all bad.<br/><br/>Give it a try!"

I am happy to say that I was impressed with the finished product.<br/><br/>There was hardly a weak link in the cast - Hagrid and Ron standing out from the rest.  The film looked fantastic.  The blending of sets and CGI was (almost) seamless - some of the quidditch backgrounds and the centaur looked a little cartoony.  But generally the world of Harry Potter looked spot on.<br/><br/>The only people who will be disappointed will be those who expect every letter of the book to be reproduced on screen.  To everyone else I can recommend this film as 2 1/2 hours well spent."

Little Harry Potter became my hero, but in the movie, i barely knew who he was. <br/><br/>They tried so hard to touch upon all that happened in the book, that is was a race to get to the end.

Scene four, It's halloween Scene Five, It's christmas Scene Six, school's over, even though there was only one class. That's what i didn't like.

The movie is slow but it does have its moments. The Quidditch (sp? wtf?) Game was very well done, especially the camera work, and same with the chess scene. Bascially the action scenes were nice. And Draco was very well cast, as he was in Anne and the King and the Borrowers, so we've all seen him around. As for the others, well, it seems that many people prefer Ron right away over the others. Harry seemed dull and just there so he could count on the attendance records. Hermoine acted stupid at times and she really needed to brush her hair. The Weasley twins- and I'm being serious- looked deformed in that scene where they, um, walk through the wall. Hunchbacks with square shoulders anyone?<br/><br/>Watch it for the laughs but don't except a marvelous adaption from the book... don't watch the film to see that heroic Harry you've read about because it might take another film to get the real him out, if they even manage to do that. If you're going to watch it, judge it as a film, as it is, and not because of the books.

"lightishdark","1","2","7","24 December 2001"," Competent but uninspired
","The movie was good, but unfortunately lacked the proverbial magic that the book had.  The director's cut was supposedly too long, and a lot of parts were cut out - perhaps this could have something to do with it.  Another example of Hollywood producers ruining a great book?  Perhaps.<br/><br/>The casting was a bit off - the most glaring error was that of Albus Dumbledore. Richard Harris failed to bring out the ""twinkle in the eye"" that was necessary for the Headmaster's character.  Robbie Coltrane was a standout as Rubeus Hagrid, and stole the show.  The main characters?  Ron Weasely was also *very* well portrayed by Rupert Grint.  Harry and Hermione were well done, but again, nothing exceptional.  One can expect them to improve in the next movie.<br/><br/>The most disappointing thing about the movie is the lack of character development:  A large portion of the cast was composed of very strong, veteran actors and actresses(Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, etc etc.) - However, none of them truly got a chance to ""work their magic"" with the audience, as they are not on the screen for long enough.  Even before the release of the movie, it was clear it was going to make a lot of money at the box office - this makes it even more of a pity that the director was not allowed to show the audience the full version of the movie.  This could have significantly improved the movie.  Would a three or 3.5 hour movie be too long for children?  Probably, but having an intermission tends to break up the ""monotony"" of the movie.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this movie still should be seen - it is well done, but not nearly as good as the book - Given the choice between the two, spending the three hours reading the book is much more fruitful than spending the two-and-a-half watching the movie."

","What can I say, I've not read the books and i'm not gonna now. After JK Rowling's pathetic feature I grudge giving the Rowling Potter machine any more cash. Why? The film lacks everything, wooden acting with a script that should end Steven Kloves' career(but won't due to the hype behind this waste of celluloid)(really Steve, Wonder Boys was good, baker boys was fantastic, but Potter should be your epitaph). Maggie Smith's Script was cringingly poor, Robbie Coltrane started the film as a 'Ooo bee there farmer' from Cornwall, and ended up as his usualy Glaswegian self, part from that he was by far the best Adult in the film. Rickman was well.... typical Rickman, no thought to his character in the script as he could have been better used. All other actors like Cleese, Hunt and Walters had the right idea, and lasted about 2 minutes each(take the money and run folks) The CGI in the film was appauling, note all the scenes with the castle in the background and anything in front of it. This was not helped by the trailer of Lord of the Rings being screened before the film started.(Chris Dickson has no idea on Special effects, and no doubt the review was written by Rowling herself) The ending was dull and could have been more interesting than it's failed attempt. As for the twist at the end and how Harry Beat Voldemort, 'Oh yeah I got it....' it was clear to the whole audiance that it was a complete copout(underlying message was okay if the kids would ever have the brains to work it out, too deep and meaningful for the film). The film should have been a 3 part kids drama, the cgi would have looked a bit better on the small screen(but still not good, it would have looked like a medium budget TV dramas attempt at special effects). But hey they need all those toys sold this christmas... Why was the film made again?<br/><br/>Above all else the plot drags on and on, (being a H potter newbie I was really interested in finding out what all the hype was about) and is 1 hour longer than it should have been. Kids will really really want to go and see it, Adults will really really want to take their kids, not for the kids to see the film, but to get 2 hours of their kids sleeping(sorry to all those adults with Hyper kids, you'll just get more agro).<br/><br/>Anyway enjoy! and remember each cinema ticket bought means another 6 films will be made.<br/><br/>BTW If Harry Potter has a record opening ticket sales, I'd say it was a fix, as the film was being screened in every local cinema(apart from the arthouse cinemas who have some sense of pride) every half hour from 8:15 am until 9:30 PM on at least 6 or 7 screens."
"berliner","1","2","7","2 December 2001"," Not for those who has not read the book.
","First, the bad things:<br/><br/>I know it's not easy for anybody to make a Harry Potter movie, especially since the book provides a story that is so rich in details and imaginative. Take the move of setting from Privet Drive to the Hut-on-the-Rock. The movie doesn't give enough explanation of that, and therefore only those who have read the book would understand. Of course there are very few people in Europe and North America who hasn't read the book(s), but the filmmakers should also consider other parts of the world where Harry Potter is not quite as popular.<br/><br/>The difference between the four houses is not explained at all, and therefore it causes some wonder why Harry said to the Sorting Hat, ""Anything but Slytherin"". What's wrong with Slytherin? the ""Muggles"" may ask.<br/><br/>Another thing, Hermione cannot seem to make up her mind about what to call he-who-must-not-be-named. Even in one scene (when the trio are talking near the fireplace) she called him ""you-know-who"", and then ""Voldemort"". And in the book we know that the reason Harry's scar hurt when he first saw Snape was because Snape ""looked past Quirrell's turban"" but this was not showed in the movie.<br/><br/>Now: the good things: All in all, I should say a very impressive movie and one that shouldn't be missed if you're a Potter-mania. The kids don't act very well but the grown-up actors and actresses are of top quality. Alan Rickman is especially great. Can't wait for the sequel."

","I really liked this film, but I much prefer the book, which has a lot more magic and wonder. Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and he is given solid support by a funny Rupert Grint and a good Emma Watson, though she was annoying at times. The scene stealer was definitely Robbie Coltrane; I actually can't imagine anyone else playing Hagrid, Coltrane was just hilarious. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were also great, but for me the standout was the late Richard Harris. Now I much prefer Harris's interpretation of Dumbledore. He was soft-spoken, and actually fitted the part better. Both of these qualities were lost in the interpretation that Michael Gambon gave. I am not saying that Michael Gambon was bad, he just wasn't my ideal choice for Harris's replacement. The film is fairly faithful to its source material, and looks very beautiful. However, it is a bit long, and very young children may find Voldemort too frightening. I know because I have triplet brother and sisters who saw it, and couldn't sleep for about a month after viewing. In conclusion, a very good film, well performed and quite dark. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","First let me say I have not read any Harry Potter books, and I think that is an advantage to enjoying these Harry Potter films. Second, let me say I am a Christian and a grandfather, and I found the witchcraft not one bit troubling.  It's a movie, after all, and in the end ""love"" is the main quality Harry Potter is credited with.<br/><br/>Even though the film is almost 2 1/2 hours long, it never seems too long. Perhaps that's because each step in the development of the characters is so interesting. The various stars are just perfect for their roles. I especially enjoyed Emma Watson as the precocious Hermoine. She is a good young actress and I enjoy her typically British facial contortions when making certain word sounds.<br/><br/>For the young, or simply young at heart, the various depictions of ""magic"" are so much fun to watch. Hermoine read her assignments, memorized useful spells, and was always ready when the need arose. The broom flying lessons on the playground. The selection of the perfect magic wand in the wand store. Catching the train to Hogwarts on platform 9 3/4.  All highly entertaining. I can understand why the Harry Potter books are so popular, the author has a great imagination.<br/><br/>When the film finally got around to action and excitement during its latter stages, it had a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" feel to it, falling in a pit of wiggly things, making narrow escapes. And the one character that at first seemed meek, mild and handicapped, later turned out to be a villian, had a ""Usual Suspects"" feel to it. Just part of film evolution, every good thing influences things that come later.<br/><br/>The DVD picture is remarkably sharp and colors realistic. The 5.1 surround sound and John Williams score complements the film very well. For collectors of good movies, a fine DVD to own. I'm happy that I have my own! :-)"

Take the move of setting from Privet Drive to the Hut-on-the-Rock. The movie doesn't give enough explanation of that, and therefore only those who have read the book would understand. Of course there are very few people in Europe and North America who hasn't read the book(s), but the filmmakers should also consider other parts of the world where Harry Potter is not quite as popular.<br/><br/>Another thing, Hermione cannot seem to make up her mind about what to call he-who-must-not-be-named. Even in one scene (when the trio are talking near the fireplace) she called him ""you-know-who"", and then ""Voldemort"". And in the book we know that the reason Harry's scar hurt when he first saw Snape was because Snape ""looked past Quirrell's turban"" but this was not showed in the movie.<br/><br/>Now: the good things: All in all, I should say a very impressive movie and one that shouldn't be missed if you're a Potter-mania. The kids don't act very well but the grown-up actors and actresses are of top quality. Alan Rickman is especially great. Can't wait for the sequel."
"Scarface0719","1","2","8","19 November 2001"," Tragic rendition of a kids book
","This movie was not on my list of movies to see, but due to extenuating circumstances I found myself in the theater for this movie.  The best part by far was the Lord of the Rings trailer that was previewed before the movie.  I thought the movie was as decent of a rendition of the book as could be done in a two and a half hour movie, but lacked a lot of things which go back to the book.  The problem I have with the book and with the movie is the cult following that Harry Potter has, when it is nothing more than a kids story.  There are much better stories out there for kids and especially adults that make this story look cheap.  The book was entertaining, but lacks depth and a thought-provoking plot.  When I was young I was reading Lord of the Rings, The Count of Monte Cristo, the Three Musketeers and other classics.  These books help build vocabulary, develop the mind, and lead to reading other classics that provide a foundation for writing and creative thinking.  I have read the first Harry Potter book, and found the writing style repetitive, and the reading level less than desirable for anyone but a third grader.<br/><br/>The movie was an entertaining kids movie, just as the book is an entertaining kids book.  The fact that it is so popular in our society is a sad testament to the lack of intelligence and the incompetence of adults and children that have grown up in the present age of cheap thrills."
"nonamealberto","1","2","9","25 November 2001"," it was ok
","I gave it a 1 in an attempt to counterbalance the idiots who probably gave it a 10 just because it's Harry Potter.  In truth I'd give it a 6.5 or so. It was a little boring...  The books, or at least the first one, which is the only one I had the will to read, sucked, because they're incredibly childish.  The movie is better simply because it moves much faster than the boring, drawn out books."
"Dragonshadow0","1","2","9","21 November 2001"," Something and nothing
","Acting and Casting:  pretty good.  Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane steal the show.  The three kid actors are ok, but I've seen better in TV series. Richard Harris is ok, but is just not Dumbledore.  Too serious by far. Better would have been Graham Crowden or Freddie Jones, both could have brought just a little bumbling into the character.  Alan Rickman is good, but is not menacing enough.  In the books, he simply oozes nastiness, in the film he's bland.  Both the Richard Harris and Alan Rickman problems are directorial errors, rather than lack of abilities on the part of the actors.<br/><br/>Effects:  on the whole, very good and not too intrusive.  On the down side,the troll is a joke.  It looks like a cartoon, and is not in the slightest a terrifying sight - no wonder Hermione doesn't seem scared. On the plus side, the entrance to Diagon Alley is superb, and the quidditch game is likewise.<br/><br/>Storyline:  On the whole it is good. You are always going to miss some parts of the book in an adaptation, but here there are important sections missing, notably the ""Norbert"" dragon sequence ending with the trip to the top of the tower where Harry loses his invisibility cloak, which is returned to him. Also the sequence where Hermione chooses the potions in Snape's trap. Aside from this, most of the important tags are there, with one or two new episodes to replace large amounts of text.  However, unforgiveable is the lack of attention to the Dursley family.  They are what makes Harry Harry, as much as his parentage.  The book is a quarter of the way through before Hagrid arrives on the scene, yet in the film, the titles are barely over. Likewise, the replacement of one enemy (the Dursleys, Dudley in particular) with another (Slytherin, Malfoy in particular) shows as a shallowness in Harry's character in the final cut.<br/><br/>Having said all that, both I and my Kids (18 and 16) thoroughly enjoyed all 153 minutes, and will probably watch it again.  It's a definite addition to the ""DVD to buy"" list.<br/><br/>Overall  7 out of 10"

There are a lot of my favourite actors like Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe.
If you like the action watch this movie.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The story takes place in a magic school called Poudlardare the people who didn't know the existence of magic.
Harry Potter is the heroe of the movie because when he was a baby, Volemort, the most mean of the wizard he tried to kill Harry but he survived he just has his famous scar on the forehead. In all the movies Harry Potter try to kill Voldemort and Voldemort too. In the first movie Harry go for the first time at Poudlard and meet his two friends Ron Weesley and Hermionne Granger. He meets also his ennemy Malfoy. Harry and his friends are in griffondor, it is a group in the school."

Even if you are expecting to watch a fictional adventure with magic, away from reality, not even basic logic is followed. Things are predictable, scenario is lame and rationalism is absent.

","Parents, if you are deciding weather or not your kid should watch it. There may be some violent scenes when Voldemort comes back for revenge. Harry Potter realizes that he is a wizard and meets new friends and some unfortunate events/people. Harry Potter realizes that magic can help you through tough times. If you decide that your kids should see this move, they may have a tough time realizing that magic is not real. This movie teaches kids that friends are there for you and can help you achieve greatness. Harry Potter realizes even with a bad family life (Parents who are not there for Harry and a mean uncle/aunt and cousin) he still manages to live a full and adventurous life. This movie is a AMAZING movie and I totally recommend seeing it."

","One of the greatest movies ever made! Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the one that kicked off the legendary franchise which birthed so many fantastic movies. There are already a ton of reviews and comments about this one and the others that I will not get into the specifics of the movie, but I think it's the acting, special effects and amazing story that really set this one above so many fantasy films for young adults. I was still a teen when this came out and it got me to read the books which I am forever grateful. For a young girl, Harry Potter taught me a lot about life, love and magic in a way that I never thought possible. It really has me believing in the power of magic which can overcome all obstacles and make good prevail in the end!"

","never has there been a book adaptation so popular or great as Harry Potter. This is one of my all time favorite movies (Alongside the others). Harry Potter is a movie people will look back at for years on end. No matter how much you watch it you will always want to visit it again and again. Some people say that these movies are meant for kids but the further these went on they became more for adults. This one you can watch with you're children all the time. This was based on a children's book, so were the others, but only the first two felt like they were for kids and the others just became more freighting for kids. It's about a kid named Harry Potter who is told by the half giant Haggrid that he is a wizard and go's to Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizardry. Who friends two kids Hermione Granger and Ron Wesley, who try to defeat the dark wizard Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents when he was young. The ending is a bit dark for kids."
"kylepowers-34278","10","1","3","11 July 2016"," Setting the tone
","Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone, this was the movie that started the whole rage about harry potter. Now don;t get me wrong the books did all the work but the movie enhanced the series even more. In this first Harry Potter there was a lot more of on location sites shot than the rest of the Harry Potter films. As you can see whenever they are out on the courtyard, or when they are first learning how to fly. I think this adds a certain aspect to the movie where it still kinda humanizes it and since it is being shot on something that is real it makes us think that it is real. Versus it being shot in a studio with a lot of graphic events. The only reason I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 is probably because it is my favorite movie ever. The other Harry Potter movies are good but this one sets the tone for the rest of them all. Harry is such a universal character that the movie makes us feel apart of him. Not that we are all wizards or know what it is like to sleep under a staircase but it's his internal qualities that make people fall in love with him. Plus a whole lot of this movie is also a lot of exploration of the whole wizarding world that we get to see through Harry's eyes and experience it for the first time with him. So we can connect with him. This movie is a must see, no matter what."
"rayers12000","10","1","3","14 June 2016"," Amazing
","I loved Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone! It was absolutely wonderful to read as well as to watch. One little thing though: In the movie scene which Professor McGonagall goes to fetch Wood, captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and tells him that she had found him a new seeker, Harry (after seeing him flying through the air, retrieving Neville's Remembrall that Malfoy threw into the air), the classroom Professor McGonagall entered was the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, according to the book. But in the movie, the teacher was Professor Quirrell. In the book, it was Professor Flitwick teaching. Just thought I'd clear that up. Other than that, great book and great movie."

","I'm a big fan of Harry Potter; the books AND the movies. I can easily say that the first movie of the series is my favourite among all 8 HP movies, and it's also one of the most successful adaptations among films based on books. It must have been a huge challenge to reflect J.K. Rowling's amazing world to the big screen, and equally challenging to do so with three main characters who happen to be only kids at the very start of their acting career. However, everything's done so professionally that the magic in the book is transferred into a movie which is interesting for almost any age group in my opinion. The glory of the unique adventure of Harry Potter is nicely put in the screenplay and every little detail from costumes to locations are blended into a movie which is only the beginning of a legendary saga."
"Sirus_the_Virus","7","1","3","3 August 2009"," The weakest of the films.
","Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone is the worst of the six films. It's not that it's a bad film, which it's not. I don't want to be mean here, but the three main characters, Harry,Ron, and Hermione, are annoying. I know it was there debut, but i'm sorry. I'm not even sure if it was there fault. But the reason why I think it's the worst is because the three main actors(Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) are annoying. It's not that they're bad actors. The thing is that Why would these three kids care about all of this stuff. Besides Harry Potter himself, why would the characters care if Snape was a villain or about the Sorcerer's stone or anything? They're supposed to be eleven. That's not all that I have a problem with. Chris Columbus doesn't have the mind that Alfonso Cuaron, Mike Newell and David Yates have. He's used to all of the cutsy stuff. I'm making The Sorcerer's stone seem like a bad film, which it's not. It is still a fun, cute movie to watch. At least the first two films aren't as good as any of the Lord of the Rings films. I mean seem like i'm not recommending it, but I am recommending it. Despite some of the flaws, Harry Potter and the sorcerer's Stone is on par with the book. it's the weakest of the films, but it's still a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: 7.3"
"headly66","4","1","3","19 July 2009"," Awfuly silly and dull
","I suppose as children's entertainment this film could be called good, but to anyone with a brain it is a messy, overindulged concoction of bad ideas and silly execution. I know nothing of the Potter books so this is based simply on the film. So much has been made of the books and film that I was predestined to be disappointed in some ways but little did I realize how trivial this movie is when cast against a powerhouse like The Lord of the Rings, really two completely different worlds. As with most modern tales of this type (HP) everything is so magical, everything moves (in some ways stupidly like the changing staircases) and it seemed so simple that no matter what issue that came up they all had an answer for everything. The worst part of the movie had to be the game played with balls and broomsticks. The whole point of having a separate game within a game is just retarded. Name one sport or game that has a special sideshow that can win the game at any moment? Imagine your team is about to win the Stanley Cup and their up 3 games to 1 and it's 4-0 with only a minute to go, but wait, don't forget there's a fan from each team playing a separate game in the men's room, and they just caught the golden plunger, so sorry your team has lost, too bad. Seems like JK's writing is a little on the light end don't you think? Why didn't the professor who is already through to the stone need to play the chess game like they did? What adults would announce the winners of a year long contest that meant so much to the kids, then seconds later say ""but wait, there's points that I forgot about""??? How cruel. Very childish and overrated."
"icynoise","2","1","3","7 January 2009"," What's the point?
","I've read reviews for these films excusing the pathetic adaptations of the stories to film because ""they are for die hard fans who know the story already"". To know what is going on at all (especially in the later films) one would certainly have to have read the books. Even as kids movies they have left out so much of the fantastic novels, you would almost think that the same people who hate the books and ban them because of ""satanic teachings"" (HA!) produced these movies to dumb them down to the point of their own ignorance and stupidity.<br/><br/>The quality of film and even acting slightly increases throughout the series, but as everyone else has already stated they are RUSHED!! It is almost as though the entire cast were directed to read off their lines as quickly as possible, and at times the acting is so horrible that I almost think that I could do better with zero acting experience, but probably not.<br/><br/>The saving grace for me was the cast which fit well, and really saved the other stuff in a big way. Kenneth Branagh in part two was my favorite match out of the bunch."

","Harry Potter is an Orphan who on his eleventh birthday discovers he's a wizard and is called to term at Hogwarts School. But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing.<br/><br/>Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now.<br/><br/>Director Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that's a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn. Oliver Twist like sets form the marvellous Diagon Alley, dream like smoke cloaks the splendid Hogwarts Express, the school itself is a monolithic delight nestling in among eerie mountains - and what about the exhilarating introduction of Quidditch? Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout.<br/><br/>The characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious ""who done it"" core of the piece, but it's down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.<br/><br/>Owls here, witches there, what's that strange three headed dog doing over there? The Harry Potter franchise begins with a bang and a whip of the wand, and I and gazillions of others personally love it. 8/10"

I have never seen a film like this, especially on this scale.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the special effects, particularly the first time Harry sees Diagon Alley. Other scenes that stand out is the great hall with the candles and pumpkins floating in the air and creatures such as the troll and three-headed dog.<br/><br/>I like the fact that the film isn't overrun with American actors/actresses and that most of the cast is British as it just seems American films and actors have the monopoly over the world cinema so it is refreshing to have the British cast as you can hear a lot of different accents from Britain and I have fun trying to guess where the accent comes from."

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful adaptation of the book by JK Rowling. Sorcerer's Stone is a film filled with the basics and never delves too deep into the full world of Harry Potter. Much like the book, the film does what it can to pull you INTO the world of Harry Potter. The rest of the books (and their films) take you on a wondrous ride THROUGH the world. This film is all about firsts: meeting magical adults and kids alike for the first time, encountering magical beasts for the first time, and facing magical peril for the first time. None of this is to suggest, however, that Sorcerer's stone is at all dull. These firsts and basics are enough to provide enjoyment over and over again. The movie never gets old, the laughs never die out and the magic never ceases. The kids are terrific and the adults are perfect, from Dumbledore and Hagird, to Snape and McGonagall. The Dursleys are terrifically awful, as they should be. Sorcerer's Stone is a great start to a great series and it gets better."
"woodchuckthatcouldchuck","3","1","3","9 May 2005"," awful rendition of a fabulous book
","Many people have read all or at least the first of the Harry Potter series. Although the books seem more aimed at children, many adults also find them fascinating. As i will attest, the books ARE very interesting and i DO enjoy indulging in them. However, when the movie came out for the first book i was already skeptical. I mean: How can a movie be made out of such a complex plot with such mentally stimulating ideas? The first problem with the movie is the acting. I know that the actors are only kids, but there still are child actors that can do a good job. These children actors were ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. Ron was the best character, and he was only mediocre. I personally would rather watch a movie with a bad plot with great actors than a great plot with terrible actors. I cant stress enough how bland all of the acting was; it was all monotone.<br/><br/>The second problem was the lack of following the storyline. another thing i hate is when a movie is made from a book which doesn't follow the storyline.<br/><br/>All in all, the only reason i gave this movie a three is because of the great story which first came to life in the form of the books."

However, I went to see the film with high hopes, and thankfully, I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Christopher Columbus has managed to capture Harry Potter the way I don't think anyone else would've been able to. The casting was also brilliant, and it's nice to know with hardworking actors like Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, the casting director wasn't wrong.<br/><br/>Most of the storyline was able to be captured, which is good, because I would have been disappointed if important facts were forgotten (As they were in Prisoner of Azkaban, but that's another story.) All in all, whether you've read the book or not, I recommend this film. It's a brilliant piece of movie history."

","If you, like so many others, had high expectations for the movie because of how good the books were, then you would have walked away disappointed. A book as popular as Harry Potter could never have been done to appeal to all its fans because so many will pick out every little mistake in the film that doesn't coincide with the book.<br/><br/>It was clearly difficult to compress the book into a movie-safe length and given that almost all who watch it will have read the books anyway, there wasn't too much left out. However, Daniel Radcliffe just doesn't work when playing Harry. Sure, he looks like him, but the way he speaks as if he's on his deathbed just isn't Harry. Likewise Emma Watson and Rupert Grint; their expression was far too over the top to seem real, despite the theme of the movie.<br/><br/>The worst of it all is that the movie had too many clichÃ©s to really stand out from the rest of the pack. It just wasn't magical."

The film, on the other hand, whilst a reasonably faithful and engaging adaptation, adds little beyond putting amiable faces to the names of the characters. All very competent and a must see for any 'Potter' fans, but hardly outstanding in its own right.<br/><br/>~ 5/10 ~"
"Rich B","4","1","3","26 December 2004"," A poorly constructed film with much storyline confusion
","I had a dim view of the Potter series of books for sometime now, with a mixture of reading reviews and total rebellion at the complete overhype of them. However I'd recently sat down and started thinking about how biased and closed those ideas were and thought that I should at least give them a go. Never happened though, and I committed myself to watching the first movie in the DVD Boxset which I gave my girlfriend for her Christmas.<br/><br/>Well, it does have a lot of the traditional elements of a kids adventure yarn, and there are some exciting moments, but for me the story was far too packed with ideas and unexplored side stories. There were flat, pantomime characters, and quite a few unexplained events and character choices, things just seemed to happen without any prior warning with the explanation being left to the very end. A very sloppy story telling device when the writer has backed the characters into a corner or has run out of time.<br/><br/>Some of the animation work was excellent, and yet the main scene of Quidditch was quite poor with all the animation being shown from a distance and at high speed. It really did look like the video game version, and there is perhaps all the answer we need.<br/><br/>Still, there was some adventure to be had, and some of the action was good, however equally editing on some of the action left a lot to be desired and simply confused events or served to pad them out without interest. A lot of these moments there was a feeling of cost or effects budget strain."

Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane etc. etc. must have sent their agents a Christmas bonus for having secured parts for them in this turkey which demanded of them less engagement than a Roger Moore 007 epic and, even better (!), set them up for numerous sequels until the kids gripped by the books finally add a few years and move onto movies for kids, (and adults!), which, unlike this junk, really DO entertain and amuse, e.g. ""Shrek"", ""Toy Story"", ""Antz"" etc. etc."

","I happened to watch Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as this film is called, on the same evening as Pietje Bell, another children's movie, and came way with approximately the same opinion on both films: nice images, good adventure, so-so acting by the leads, and sometimes grating dialogue.<br/><br/>The beginning, I felt, moved a bit slowly and eratically. It took Harry ages to go to the wizards' school, and the premonitions about his magical qualities could have been smeared less thickly. At times even Harry's actor seemed to look on in disbelief at Harry's powers, having quickly run out of facial expressions of disbelieve to display."
"smashattack","4","1","3","23 July 2003"," Harry Potter was meant for pages, not film.
","It is obvious that something has gone terribly wrong.  It seems J. K. Rowling is focusing much on the new Harry Potter movies, and I wouldn't doubt it soon if the sixth or seventh movie(s) came out before the book(s).<br/><br/>But I'm not here to talk about the books, I'm here to talk about the movie. To discuss how this movie translated from the book would be unfair, so I'll wipe the book from my memory for now.<br/><br/>First of all, I must say that John Williams was the worst person for scoring the music.  Williams has done great things in this area, and has been entirely innovative about his craft.  However, the entire soundtrack of this movie is cliche.  It sounds like something from a very, VERY old seventies movie.  Example:  The notes of the orchestra have a ""spiraling up and down"" feeling, giving the impression of something out of an old horror movie.  The themes are practically not new.  Williams was trying to go for themes, when what it really needed was an ominous feeling.  Not this ""magical"" stuff that could be found in old Disney movies.  It seems Williams is losing his luster, and I'd have preferred Elfman or possibly even Goldsmith to score this movie.<br/><br/>The first thing one will notice upon watching this movie, other than the bland score, is the tasteless acting.  While I can understand most of these people are young, never-before actors, it can be quite annoying.  It seems the directors MEANT to put Hermione up to saying things in a cliche, ""I'm-better-than-you,"" tone.  Ron is a total whiner, and can't seem to control emotions.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is probably the best of the three in this first movie (luckily, the sequel patches up the acting, so it's obvious the problems arose simply because they're new--and, like I said, understandable).<br/><br/>Some of the acting is great.  Dumbledore is obvious a top-notch actor (his performance in Gladiator is a good example of his previous, outstanding talent).  Hagrid and his, ""Nope, shouldn't have said that, uh-uh..."" is totally believable, and I find him to be one of the better actors in the movie.<br/><br/>However, probably my favorite actor in the entire movie goes to the person who has only about five lines in the script.  Filch.  ""God, how I miss the screams.""  His character is just creepy, and the actor puts him into such a great tangible experience.<br/><br/>The plot is nice, as its taken from the book (ah, forgive me!).  I'd like to say that it loses some of its charm from its adaptation... but I promised I wouldn't go into that.<br/><br/>Anyway, it has a nice villain, believable central plot (although the movie doesn't seem to explain quite as well as the book... seems to be some holes, but oh well, read the book).<br/><br/>Probably the worst thing about this movie is that it manages to use every single cliche imaginable.  Harry flies down from his broom, clutching Neville's Remembrall, and a swarm of young children are cheering simply because he caught the little ball while Williams' ""heroic"" music plays. That scene is actually sickening... it reminds me of some ""young children beats up the intelligent, corporate tough man"" movie.  Harry says a few words to a snake, then immediately says, ""Can you hear me?""  Ron states heroically (after Harry asks what happens after the white pieces move their pawn), ""Then... we play.""  Once again, Williams' music only serves to heighten the corniness.  It's annoying.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was an annoyance.  Simply geared for younger kids, which cause older viewers to cringe at the sheer stupidity.  Good effects, good plot, good story, and some good characters... but those factors can't make up for the total childishness of the movie."
"AgentCool","2","1","3","27 June 2003"," Even worse than I expected
","I watched Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone on Sky not expecting too much from it. However, it was far worse than the low expectations I had set out for it. As someone who hasn't read the book(s) I thought I was in a good position to review the film for what it is, a film. However, if you haven't read the book you are unlikely to understand much of what is going on.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes and things that happen do so fairly randomly and for much of the time everything seems pointless. I can't recall the number of times I saw a scene and thought how useless to the 'going-nowhere' plot it was. As well as this, there are scenes included that are obviously relevant to the book but seem to have little relevance to the plot of the film. For example, the ghost like characters were utterly irrelevant and clearly had no purpose in the film whatsoever, adding to the needlessly extensive running time. Then there are the long, drawn out shots of the Hogwarts interiors which are obviously included so the film makers can show off how faithful to the book's descriptions their sets are.<br/><br/>It is these points that mainly annoy me about HPATPS because it is simply a film adaptation of a book that has quite obviously not been adjusted for the screen rendition at all. The pages of the book have been copied over to the script without any logical thought making for a confused mess of a movie.<br/><br/>The film would have been much better being a tighter version of the book, missing out characters and scenes that were of little significance. This is, of course, what has been done in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy of films with some plot elements being changed entirely to suit the screen and its audience.<br/><br/>Visually, 'The Philosopher's Stone' is inferior to many films I have seen in the past decade and for a film made in 2001, it is very disappointing in this respect. The CG is almost entirely unconvincing with the Quidditch stadium being the most laughable. Perhaps if the rest of the film had been made in a cartoon like style it would have worked but the dark stone interiors and attempts to make the otherworldly creatures look realistic are too much of a contrast to the brightly coloured outdoor arena. This is most hilarious at the end of the quidditch game when Harry is stood on the CG super-flourescent green grass. Then it immediately cuts to a shot outside of Hogwarts where the grass is real, and much darker.<br/><br/>Obviously, readers of the Harry Potter books will get a lot of enjoyment out of a film that lifts the pages of the book and presents you with one person's vision of how it would look in 'reality'. It doesn't allow you to think at all, simply throwing too much Harry Potter detail into your face which, if you're like me, will have its eyes shut and be snoring away by the 'climax'."

The book shows how all 3 kids overcome the challenges by doing what they are good at. And the movie leaves some of that out.  The kids were awful actors.  They must have cast the cheapest kids they could find.<br/><br/>
Dumbledore was what I pictured from the book. I also liked the Gobulin Bank, the mirror, and the hidden alley.  It was pretty much like the book. The special effects were good, but that doesn't make up for the slow pace of the movie.  Time just flew by when reading the book.  The quiddick match wasn't that great in the movie either.<br/><br/>

I'm going to be sick....<br/><br/>I read ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" a few months before the movie was released on DVD and I was delighted by the story -- meek and meager Harry Potter just happens to be from a line of Wizards and and the whirlwind tale that takes place during his first year at Hogwarts...<br/><br/>I thought to myself that with all the cheer and hoopla over the movie, it would be just as enjoyable as the book.  I was proven totally wrong in Chris Columbus' vision of Harry and his world.<br/><br/>There were some things I enjoyed about the movie - Ian Hart (who's most memorable role before this was as John Lennon in 1994's ""Backbeat"") as Professor Quirrel, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Rupert Grit as Ron Weasley, Alan Rickman (as usual) as professor Snape, the Late Richard Harris... But the key things in the movie I couldn't stand was hwo Chris Columbus made Harry the center of the world and how he and Steven Kloves screenplay failed to tell the story in a compelling cinematic way....<br/><br/>I don't know if it was Daniel Radcliffe or Columbus that decided that Radcliffe should play the roll of Harry as a model instead of as a human being...  Nor do I know if it was Kloves or Columbus that decided to downplay the difference between Muggles and Wizards and how Harry's parents avoided telling him the truth about his parents....  Or even forgoing telling us how VILE this kid's existence was with his Aunt and Uncle until he was rescued by Hagrid....  This stuff alone repulsed me and turned me off to the movie entirely.<br/><br/>Then there's the point where Harry was always brought to the forefront in scenes.  He stood in the front of groups, he sat in the front of classes when he was a key person in a scene....  Yes, he is the STAR of the movie and the person the story revolves around, but mix in the kid's story-book persona with everything else -- he was always just another kid with hand-me-down's....  Ridiculed and revialed by those surrounding him... His image could be a stand out in a group -- but not the leader of the group (and by group I mean students in general - not just Hermione and Ron and Neville)...<br/><br/>I shouldn't get on Daniel for his portrayal - he's a kid and of course he isn't a shakespearean actor...  Meaning my negative review for him should be only negativity rested upon Chris Columbus' vision which I see as a failure. Yes, the big budget and monetary return proves otherwise, but when you have a childrens phenomenon on the big screen, you will always get large returns. Look at Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and how they did in the box office, or even Pokemon's first movie..."

"Buddy-51","Null","1","3","4 July 2002"," starts off well but can't sustain itself
","I must admit right up front that I have never read the J.K. Rowling novel on which `Harry Potter: The Sorcerer's Stone' is based.  As a result, I come to the movie `cold' as it were, being neither a full-fledged aficionado nor an inveterate denigrator of this phenomenally popular book series that, in the past few years, has taken the literary world by storm.  Thus, I will not be able to say to what degree Chris Columbus' handsomely designed film adaptation does or does not do justice to its source.  All I can say is how the film struck someone like myself who comes to the material fresh and without expectations of any kind. Well, the verdict, I must say, is a decidedly mixed one, so please allow me to elaborate.<br/><br/>Let me state, at the outset, that the movie starts off splendidly.   We are introduced to the infant Harry Potter as he is mysteriously dropped off one night at the home of his maternal aunt and uncle in suburban England.  We quickly move ahead in time to find Harry, now aged 11, living a sort of male Cinderella existence, mistreated and overlooked by both his surrogate parents and Harry's precocious, spoiled brat cousin, appropriately named Dudley.  In the early stretches, the film does a superb job subtly injecting the excitement of magic into a real world setting.  There is also quite a bit of wry humor as Harry begins to slowly awaken to the fact that he has these strange and inexplicable powers to manipulate the elements of his world to his own advantage.  The film retains its spirit of fun as Harry, led by the mysterious but lovably burly Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid, journeys to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn the tools of the trade towards which his eccentric destiny is leading him (his parents were also witches, killed by the evil wizard, Voldemort, who obviously has designs on Potter himself).  The preparations for Harry's enrollment in school (i.e. purchasing a magic wand) and the attempt to find his way to this magic hidden land are executed with fine, deft strokes, and Columbus keeps the movie blithely bouncing along at just the right momentum and speed.  Harry's introduction to the school itself is well done as well, as he meets an assortment of colorful characters (both faculty members and schoolmates) and boggles at the amusement park-like atmosphere he finds there, with an imaginative surprise seemingly lurking around ever corner.<br/><br/>Yet not too long after we hit the school, something seems to go out of `Harry Potter.'  Perhaps the anticipation raised by the first half of the film leads us to expect too much, but, if the truth be told, the storytellers don't seem to have thought much about what to do with Harry once they get him to his destination.   Though we like Potter's two chums, Ron and Hermione, and a number of the faculty members, the adventures Harry ends up encountering while at the school seem rather tame, bland and ordinary when you get right down to it.  The monsters the writers have dreamed up for him to conquer aren't particularly interesting or intriguing and the plotting itself lacks excitement and suspense.  In fact, structurally, the film seems more like a series of elaborate set pieces designed more to show off the special effects than to provide a unified narrative that builds and grows to a cumulative impact.  Even worse is that much of the ribald humor of the earlier part disappears as well.  Had more of that dry British wit we are treated to in the initial stages been carried all the way through the film, `Harry Potter' might not have come across as quite so flat and attenuated as it does.<br/><br/>On the positive side, Daniel Radcliffe gives a superb performance as Harry, capturing the innate goodness, wide-eyed innocence, and no-nonsense practicality of the character he's been called upon to play.  He makes of Harry a very real, very recognizable and very likable young boy.  Radcliffe is more than matched in performance by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Ron and Hermione, Harry's two finely drawn companions in adventure.  It's a pleasure, too, to see the wonderful Maggie Smith doing her Miss Jean Brodie bit again after all these years.  No one can convey the brittle starchiness of the English schoolmarm better than she.<br/><br/>`Harry Potter' is also a beautiful looking film, thanks to outstanding cinematography, production design and art direction.<br/><br/>So there you have it:  as I said earlier, a decidedly mixed bag of virtues and drawbacks.  Those already enamored of little Harry Potter will probably balk at my carping.  Those already driven mad by Potter-mania may think I am too indulgent in my overall assessment.   But for one who feels little personal stake in the Harry Potter deification/demonization battle, I must say that this is a pretty good film that, I suspect, could have been much better."

","There is a classic early 90's Far Side cartoon that shows 3 people standing in an otherwise empty room with a banner hanging overhead painted with the letters, 'DLDWWS.' The acronym means ""Didn't Like Dances With Wolves Society."" Gary Larson really captured a phenomenon I'd call the 'societal embrace.' Enough people give a product their stamp of approval that it nearly becomes propaganda. No person can escape at least making a decision about that product. This cultural phenomenon has happened many times, including this year, most notably with feature films. In late 2001 and early 2002, there was no escape from Harry Potter. <br/><br/>With that, I hereby begin DLHPSSS (Didn't Like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Society). The first half hour or so I found interesting. Then I noticed that the film continued to roll, but there was still no sign of an actual story. Poor Harry had no objective. There was no jeopardy. Two hours in, finally, something. There's this magic stone created by the world's most powerful wizard (probably all that's protecting him from mass ridicule over being named Dumbledore). By that time I had ceased to care. I can't remember ever caring less how a film was going to end (or wishing more that one simply would). The ending that did eventually come, frankly, stunk. Not only did it keep going, but they add to the agony by reminding the audience of the useless points contest between the houses. I was actually happy when the Slitherin house won. They even ruined that moment for me.<br/><br/>
On the way out, my brother, who I saw this with, made a good analogy. He said the film was like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or some other Disneyland ride where you just travel through and watch various animatronic things jump out at you. There's no real story, it's just a bunch of neat things to look at. ""Harry Potter"" isn't far off from this. The plot is missing for so long that it ends up being a whole lot of nothing.     <br/><br/>It's been a long time since ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was released, so long that I'd forgotten why I avoided seeing it in the first place. I sensed that director Chris Columbus, fearing rejection from the book's untold numbers of adorers, had stayed extraordinarily faithful to its content, making ""Harry"" a cash cow just waiting to be fed. There was no risk involved for the film's creators, who knew its audience came built in. None of this is any fault of Rowling's. I'm sure she's written a fine book (yes, I'm the one who hasn't read it yet.) There's a big difference between cinematic storytelling and the dramatic arc of a novel. A novel can survive on details and character alone for a long time. ""Harry Potter"" tries to survive for too much of its ungodly 2.5-hour length on just following Harry around before finally doing something with him. It's a shame because the character is actually intriguing.  <br/><br/>I never bought into the ""Harry Potter"" propaganda, but there I was, buying a ticket anyway. I sensed a hesitation from the ticket seller, actually, when I heard 'Harry Potter' come out of my mouth, like he was giving me one last chance to change my mind (""Dude, are you sure you want to see THAT movie?"") Curiosity got the best of me. I find solace in that there are still a couple of people out there who haven't seen it who can still be saved. Maybe I should have seen it sooner.<br/><br/>Grade: D+"

I have an option of routes either the District line to the East End and then South, or the Docklands railway through Canary Wharf. Whichever way I take, wherever the whim takes me one thing is guaranteed - someone will always be reading a 'Harry Potter' (or Louis De Bernieres, but don't get me started on that 'mandolin' film!). These aren't kids, mind you - but fully formed adults with (assumedly) adult sensibilities and understanding. People with entire libraries of educated, intelligent writing at their disposal. <br/><br/>Why, oh why, then are they being sucked in by this RUBBISH!<br/><br/>I must confess, the 'hype', and the good words of friends, led me to order all four books. Either luck, or fate, has intervened as it has been 10 weeks since and they still havn't arrived. Good job - for as soon as they do they're going straight back!<br/><br/>My reasoning? The basis that the film, as being deemed by the author (the perpetually miserable JK Rowling), is as close to the book as you can get. It must truly, truly suck as a piece of fiction, because, boy, does it suck as a movie?!<br/><br/>The acting from the relative newcomers puts me in mind of the Children's Film Foundation of the early 70's - stilted, unconvincing, poorly potrayed. They are badly served by a shoddy script of half sentances and pointless dialogue. The Adults - Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltraine play Maggie Smith, Richard Harris and Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltraine. There have been lulled into this on the cheap and forced to act out this appalling ABC of filmaking: ""First I was orphaned, and then I became a wizard, and then I went to school and then I learnt to fly and then I found a three headed dog, and then I found a dragon, and then I found a unicorn...."", It just goes on and on. Crammed full of ideas that don't hold together, and ultimately mean nothing, there is little suspense or satisfying denouement.<br/><br/>The special effects are good.<br/><br/>This isn't even a film for kids, it's a film for kids that have read the book. I guess the film-makers are (literally) banking that the hype of the books will transfer to the screen. Let's face it, there's little else going for it."

","I saw ""Potter"" in an open frame of mind.  I have not read the books, and know next to nothing about the whole Potter phenomenon.  I'm also not particularly into the occult, though that can be interesting, like anything else.<br/><br/>What was not particularly interesting was ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.""  I found it derivative and unoriginal.  Every Halloween cliche and image, from magic wands to flying broomsticks to trolls to centaurs, is dragged out of the closet one more time.  The film is fantasy fulfillment for the pre-teen and teen set, and as such has a certain value.  As art, though, it falls short.<br/><br/>The acting is the film's greatest weakness.  The child stars clearly were picked for their looks and not any particular acting finesse.  The child they picked - to the accompaniment of international hype - to star as Potter has all the makings of another Mark Hamill.  He no doubt will become a legend among Potter groupies and do the inevitable boatload of sequels, but shows no particular promise outside this particular role.  His primary acting talent is to give a big toothy grin whenever his enemies are tormented or he triumphs at something or other (which happens with monotonous regularity).  In between triumphs, he generally just looks blank, which is a welcome break from his mugging when everyone sees how wonderful he is.<br/><br/>The most striking thing about the other actors is how their talents are utterly squandered.  Most striking is John Cleese, who floats in as a ghost and is given absolutely nothing of interest to say.  Perhaps they are setting his character up for the sequels.  However, since I'm reviewing this film, not them, why he is present at all is a mystery.  Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are the only actors that make any impact, though John Hurt is fine in a cameo.  This film badly needed strong contributions from the likes of Cleese, Richard Harris and the rest, but the script hamstrings them and instead dwells on the kids.  It's too bad, because a film about the adults in this make-believe world would have been an artistic, if not financial, success.<br/><br/>Technically, the film falls flat in a number of areas.  Most annoying is the background score, which loudly intrudes at every possible instance.  Harry walks down a path - and the music wells. The editing is a horror, as scenes that could have been riveting, such as the chess match toward the end, are butchered.  If you are going to base the outcome of the tale on a chess match, at least show a little bit of the game!  The film's makers clearly look down on their audience as people either incapable or uninterested in understanding a chess match.  Instead, they substitute neutered violence by the chess pieces when they capture each other.  There was no drama, just more chances for Harry and his crew to look around blankly yet again and await the inevitable triumph.  The end of the film, when Potter's school rivals are emotionally crushed, was unintentionally depressing to this viewer.  Can't Potter succeed without his lessers being humiliated?  Not in this film.<br/><br/>The affected upper-class British accents make a number of the characters, particularly Harry's friend Hermione, appear unsympathetic and ridiculous at times.  Expecting a 13-year-old to play a know-it-all and still remain likeable was way too much of a chore for this particular proto-actress. The entire film has a certain voyeuristic flair to it, dwelling on images of sumptuous banquets and manor halls and the like.  There is great possibility for satire here, but the film misses its chances and plays it straight. I'm sure a host of comedians are salivating at the prospect won't waste the opportunity.<br/><br/>A bit of inventiveness might have saved the film, but that is sorely lacking.  There is little original about this ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" type of tale.  The hyped ball game in the middle of the film makes little sense, as Harry (of course) saves the day by singlehandedly catching a butterfly or something after half his team has been wiped out, thus nullifying the efforts of everyone else involved.  Ultimately, the film is a fantasy about exciting times at boarding school, with these ""magical"" students going back to their homes at the end, which makes no sense at all. Harry saves the world, but what really matters is that he shows that his crew is superior to his school competitors.  This sort of ""For me to win you must fail"" ending seems in vogue right now, in films like ""Legally Blonde,"" and is far from attractive.<br/><br/>Scenes and motifs are ripped off from much better films, such as ""Time Bandits,"" ""Total Recall,"" ""Rollerball"" and ""The Longest Yard.""  I recommend any of those films over this one.<br/><br/>So was there anything redeeming about the film?  Certainly.  The three pre-teens I saw the film with loved it, particularly the four-year-old, who has seen it three times (so far).  Hard for something to seem unoriginal when you are that age - which tells you something about the natural audience for this film.  Children and undemanding adults will no doubt find the constant stream of tired occult images and colorful characters riveting, but they do not make for high art.<br/><br/>This film, running at about three hours, will be a great babysitter when it comes out on dvd, the ""ET"" of its time.  If you have kids, you no doubt will wind up owning it, and if possible should wait until then to have them see it.  Otherwise, try to find someone else to take them to see ""Potter"" during its theater run.  You'll be doing yourself a huge favor.  Five stars out of ten for keeping the kids quiet for that long."

","(I have described certain elements of structure and plot but in general terms that I hope will not spoil the story for those who don't know it)<br/><br/>I expected a roller coaster ride, but was instead taken on a rather pedestrian stroll around the world of Harry Potter. Of course, if I'd seen this film as a young child, I would have been thrilled to bits with this escape into a world where children learn to be wizards and witches.<br/><br/>Having read all the books to my son, I'm not a big fan. But I did think Harry Potter's story could be made into a series of fantastic movies. In my opinion, that opportunity has been wasted. For me, the structure of the screenplay was poor, devised to please several million expectant fanatics. Because the creators of the movie had their audience on a plate, they didn't have to worry about drawing anyone into the story. So we get a series of events designed not to disappoint those coming to see their favorite bits from the book.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film can be compared to that of Time Bandits - young boy with nasty parents taken into another world. But whereas I was right with the boy in Time Bandits, drawn into his story by the skill of the film makers, I was only a spectator as the bizarre series of events unfold in Harry's life. I didn't really get a feeling of Harry's misery while living with the Dursleys.<br/><br/>Bearing in mind what you can achieve with digital effects these days, the makers of this film created little sense of great magic. A big let-down when you're watching a film about magicians. I think this film lacks the sense of awe and wonder that a director like Spielberg could have created. In fact, I felt very little emotion throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>It's strange that, with 2 1/2 hours to play with, I didn't really get a great deal from any of the characters. The film relies completely on the three children at the centre of the story, with the others popping up every now and then. Unfortunately, Harry is up-staged by his companions. There is hardly an indication that the evil Harry has to defeat is actually present until the end. So I didn't find the sense of struggle or danger that would have kept me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>In all, this film failed to touch me. I wanted to be there with Harry as he went from suburban misery to the wonderful Hogwarts. But I just didn't connect with him. I believe this is due, mainly, to the structure and design of the screenplay. The tame direction and some wooden acting in places didn't help.<br/><br/>It will of course make zillions and thrill children across the globe for many years to come."
"mccormick632","6","1","4","15 January 2011"," There are so many things wrong with this movie....
","I have to feel slightly kind towards this movie. After all it wasn't that bad when compared to the newer movies. That being said, it still is pretty bad. Numerous plot holes, and several bulls*** moments ruin the movie. I mean this is bad, really bad. I could literally rant on this film (and the franchise as a whole) for hours.<br/><br/>Now I must admit, I liked this movie when I first saw it. Nowadays, watching this movie again I can't take it seriously when there is always something that takes me out of the movie. Whether it is the terrible writing, the stupid characters, the boring plot, etc. there are almost no scenes where I have questions or find something wrong with it. The thing I do like about this movie and the other films as well is that the cinematography is excellent. The lighting, sets, and the special effects are all excellent. But that does little to save the film.<br/><br/>Most of my complaints would be forgivable if the story was good right? Yet this is one of the laziest and the most poorly written stories in film (and literature) history. This story has the most holes I have ever seen. For starters: how come the Dursley's don't want Harry to go to Hogwarts? Its pretty clear that they don't like him one bit, proved by the way they constantly shove him aside and have him sleep in under the F*****G STAIRS! IS THERE NO SUCH THING AS CHILD SERVICES IN Britain?! I mean for gods sake! He sleeps in a f*****g cupboard, they make him cook for them, he should sue their** for neglect or at the very least, child cruelty. <br/><br/>Anyway, back to why the Dursley's keep Harry away from Hogwarts, wouldn't letting him go solve their problems? They don't like him, they don't want him, so why not let him go?! It would get him off their hands for a majority of the year. Harry would be happy, the Dursley's will be happy, everyone wins.<br/><br/>At this point I'm only 15 minutes into the movie and already I've lost hope for it being any good. Any semblance of favorable nostalgia I have for this film is long gone. <br/><br/>Onto the Quidditch match, are there no such things as rules?! The teacher who started the game off said that she wanted ""a clean game."" Literally one minute later, two Gryffindore players have been injured at the hands of the Slytherin players. I mean seriously, one of the hits the goalie with a ball, two Slytherin players force one Gryffindore player into one of the f*****g towers, falling down it onto the field from what could be dozens of feet in the air while flying at relatively fast speeds. Is there no such thing as a disqualification?! Players must have a clean game but are free to hit and severely injure players as much as they wish. I guess if they don't kill them than its okay (sarcasm). The whole Quidditch scene baffled me. It made no sense and was incredibly stupid as a whole.<br/><br/>I feel this would be a good time to talk about the characters. First I want to rant about Hermione. It's established that her parents are muggles. If that's true, then how the f*** did she get into Hogwarts? If her parents are not aware of the school than how did she get in? If her parents are aware, than that must mean other parents are aware as well, if so, then how come Hogwarts isn't getting flooded with people trying to get in? It would make the selection process much more prestigious and to be accepted would mean great things about your family. Yet this possibility is immediately negated when Harry is trying to get to Platform 9 3/4 when the worker there knows nothing about the platform. (*Note: I am about to rant on this scene). When Harry meets Ron and they go to the platform, how does no one see them at all? One guy walks right past one of the Weasley kids goes running into the wall and vanishes into thin air. HOW DO YOU NOT NOTICE THAT?! HOW COULD YOU NOT NOTICE PEOPLE RUNNING INTO WALLS AND DISAPPEARING AND NOT F*****G NOTICE?! THERE'S SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF AND THEN THERE'S INSULTING MY F*****G INTELLIGENCE! Then there is our main villain, Voldemort. Aside from having the stupidest name for a villain in history, his motivation is that he is just a power hungry a*****e, nothing more.<br/><br/>There is so much wrong with this movie, I could go on for another ten minutes, but if you're still reading this then I will finish this up.<br/><br/>The ending of this movie makes no sense whatsoever. When Harry goes into that room with Professor Quirrell in it, Harry finally sees Voldemort for the first time, and we see Voldemort on the back of Quirrell's head. Not only is this effect laughable, it's downright stupid. Voldemort looks just as silly as he does in the newer movies, and not the least bit intimidating. Anyway, when Harry refuses Voldemort's promise of power, he sends Quirrell to attack. Yet, when Harry touches him, his hand melts in a way similar to that of acid. At first I thought it was because Harry was an alien from Ridley Scott's classic film, Alien, but no, that would have been cool. Instead, it is all because of love. Love from Harry's mother who died to save him...WHAT?! IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF F*****G LOVE? THAT IS SO STUPID IT BLOWS MY MIND! F*** THIS MOVIE! It's a stupid, idiotic mess of a movie with terrible writing and stupid characters. I hated nearly every scene in this movie. If it weren't for Alan Rickman and the good cinematography, I would award this with a much lower score, but as it stands, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a 4/10."

He goes to live and study at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Scotland. <br/><br/>I cannot understand the massive popularity of this film, or why it spawned so many sequels. It has dull dialogue, stock characters, mediocre acting and a ridiculous plot. <br/><br/>Before I watched it I heard a lot of critics, journalists, filmgoers and people involved in making the film claim that there's a lot in the film for adult viewers to enjoy.

I am certain that the film would have been a classic had someone had the balls to reshape the novel into a movie instead of trying to make the movie into the novel. <br/><br/>If you want to see a good, but not great movie, and to get a faithful feeling for one of the most successful series of books ever made without having to days reading the books then by all means watch this, just expect frequent draggy spots."

","With the sixth book now out (and one more to go), I feel that I should review ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". By now, the Harry Potter books have become so well entrenched in our culture that I don't even need to explain the story. But I can say that director Chris Columbus did a great job adapting the book to the silver screen.<br/><br/>The cast does very well with the roles: newcomer Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter, making him strong-willed but vulnerable. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson play his friends, the uptight Ron Weasley and the no-nonsense Hermione Granger. The Hogwarts staff is played by a who's-who of British actors: Richard Harris as headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as anthropomorphic Prof. Minerva McGonagall (and one can detect a hint of Miss Jean Brodie there), Alan Rickman as unctuous Prof. Severus Snape, and Robbie Coltrane as gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid. Others include Zoe Wanamaker as Quidditch teacher Madame Hooch, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley (Ron's mum), Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley (Harry's mean uncle) and even John Cleese as Nearly-Headless-Nick, one of the school ghosts.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie for the ages. I know that religious fundamentalists will claim that the Harry Potter books are promoting witchcraft, but are we really going to believe those kinds of people, considering that they claimed the same things about ""Bewitched""? Harry Potter will live forever - something that no Muggle can do."

","Excessive and nearly completely tedious first installment in the sure-to-be long running series. The famous books come to life on the silver screen with ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"". Young Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is recruited to Hogwart's School to learn the arts of being a wizard. He immediately makes friends in Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, but nothing seems quite right. The titled stone, guarded by a three-headed dog, appears to be the target of one of the faculty members at the academy. It must be shady professor Alan Rickman, right? Chicago critic Richard Roeper called this ""The Wizard of Oz"" of this film-going generation, but really come on. This movie is not in the galaxy of films as the aforementioned production. Early success here gives way to a nearly unending running time and special effects that could tire more than interest. Rickman, along with legitimate performers like Maggie Smith, John Cleese, Warwick Davis, John Hurt and Richard Harris get shoved aside by ugly visual effects and the film's three adolescent leads (behaving like mischievous brats throughout). Director Chris Columbus (a film-maker that somehow continues to work on big budget junk) continues to show shortcomings and I think the scope of the book and the film are just way too much for him and the performers. 2.5 out of 5 stars."
"jboothmillard","8","2","21","15 March 2005"," Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
","The first of the popular books by J.K. Rowling was one of the most anticipated films at the time, and it became one of the most successful family films in cinema, from director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire). Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has lived with his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and their son since he was a baby. Then one day, after attacks by letters for him, Rubeus Hagrid (BAFTA nominated Robbie Coltrane) takes Harry to be taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He takes money from the Wizard Bank and buys a wand from Mr. Ollivander (John Hurt) on the way, and he also finds out he is famous for surviving an attack by He Who Must Not Be Named, explaining the scar on his forehead. When Harry is on his way to Hogwarts at London Liverpool Station he needs to find Platform 9 and 3 quarters, and asking Mrs. Molly Weasley (Julie Walters) he goes through a wall between platforms 9 and 10. On the train he meets Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and briefly Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson). Then at the school, they meet Professor Minerva McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith), the mean Slytherin bound Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), before going in front of Professor Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and the other teachers to be put into the appropriate houses by the wizard hat. The film continues to see their lessons with teachers, including Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) teaching potions, Madame Hooch (ZoÃ« Wanamaker) teaching broom flying, and Professor Flitwick (Leprechaun's Warwick Davis, also playing Goblin Bank Teller) teaching levitation. Then is the first and (then) gripping Quidditch game, Gryffindor vs. Slytherin with Harry as the seeker trying to catch the Golden Snitch to win the game, while everyone scores with the Quaffel. But as time goes by, Harry, Ron and Hermoine discover a plan to steal something guarded by the giant two-headed dog (Fluffy), that they later find out is called the Philosopher's Stone (the Americans insist on calling the boring Sorcerer's Stone). Harry and the other two eventually pluck up the courage to get past the dog, and traps, including Devil's Snare plants, flying keys (to the door) and the giant game of Wizard's Chess. Harry eventually faces his great foe, and he suspected the very mysterious Snape, but it was in fact Professor Quirinus Quirrell (Ian Hart), but the real villain is on the back of his head, Harry's parents killer Vodermort, aka He Who (well, you know the rest). Harry survives and kills Voldermort and Quirrel, is reunited with his friends, Gryffindor deservedly wins the house cup, and Harry goes home with great memories. Also starring John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick and David Bradley as Argus Filch. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Music for John Williams, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Feature Film (Children's Award), Best Special Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design and Best Sound. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?), the film was number 11 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Family Films.

","As someone who has not read the books and just watched the movie for the first time I am surprised with what I encountered. Harry Potter comes across as having a hero complex or some nonsense. Why does he feel like he and his posse have to be the ones to figure out what is happening. If he just let the professors do their job things would work out, that Snape guy seemed like a pretty sharp individual I am sure he had things covered. Letting my kids watch that I was just thinking to myself, ""If all this rule breaking went on in my house I'd have to lay the law down"". Harry and company though, they get to take a walk in the woods as punishment. Just missing the hut made of candy if you ask me. The other thing I noticed was dividing the student body into groups or social division going on. First you see ""muggles"" having their own classification and then the first thing they do to first years entering the school is sort them into cliques. It's like they are asking to create a rift between students and on top of that there is a house cup competition going on? No rules whatsoever if I feel like docking points I do. I mean that leaves the gate open to favoritism if you ask me. So in short the movie focuses on an entitled boy who thinks it's ok to break rules because he is the chosen hero in a school that supports dividing the student body."
"MGPT80","4","0","2","14 April 2020"," A poor start to the series
","While the series improves as it progress, I found the first two instalments of the Harry Potter franchise quite unenjoyable. Rowling relies heavily on plot band-aids to cover up her mediocre writing and I really cannot think of a more overrated author. I don't even know where to begin regarding the logistical errors of Rowling's work in this particular story. The nonsensical Quidditch scoring system, the abusive Dursleys, Harry's entirely inherited magical abilities, the ridiculous house points scoring system (the ending is just a joke, if I was in Slytherin I would have rioted). These are all bad enough, but it's the overall lack of a cohesive plot that really makes this story so weak. There is no real reason why anything happens, it's merely just a string of random events designed to make the main characters look heroic while the adults gush over them from afar.<br/><br/>The casting choices are highly satisfactory at least, particularly Robbie Coltrane and Emma Watson. Daniel Radcliffe, however, is very weak in this first instalment- his wooden acting and excessive cutesiness become tiring very quickly.<br/><br/>The special effects are no better, especially considering the budget. The troll is simply laughable, the depiction of Voldemort is atrocious and the flying sequences and Quidditch match are like scenes from a daytime children's TV show. I'm not sure how a 21st century film of this magnitude can contain such uninspiring animations. The sets are very good and I do feel like they bought Hogwarts to life quite accurately, but everything falls apart as soon as any CGI is used.<br/><br/>On top of all these criticisms, the film is just way too long. I appreciate the attempt to tell the story comprehensively, but it's very difficult to consume this movie in one sitting, especially for children. Certain scenes could easily have been shortened or excluded without damaging the story in any way."

We move from month to month rather disorientingly.

","To evaluate the movie adaptations of books, I try to see the movie as a standalone object, and try to evaluate how the movie works for someone who did not read the underlying book. And as a person who did not read any of the Harry Potter books, I believe I am in the position to make this evaluation objectively. I can say that for the first movie of Harry Potter Series, this way of thinking signals a huge failure. The movie just assumes that you know all of the significant background information about this universe. Everything just... happens, you do not understand how, and no one cares to tell. No one is surprised of any magical stuff going on.<br/><br/>Of course during the movie adaptation of this depth, lots of important stuff is cut to fit the content to 2 hours, and it significantly damages the narrative. I had the same experience in Lord of the Rings. But at least in those movies there was the acting, and the character depth. In Harry Potter, there is almost no acting. And no character depth at all, we have no idea who the characters are, what are their motives. Half of the movie is allocated to the pointless scenes of the three main characters, and we are not even told who Dumbledore is, who Voldemort is, what is the story of Hogwarts etc.<br/><br/>To sum up, I did not enjoy the movie at all. It is unfortunately nothing more than a movie for kids. I do not say this as an insult, if it was caategorized as a Kids movie, I would have rated it differently.

For starters it was meant to be a children' movie, with children actors, you can't compare these new actors to the previous great Hollywood's actors, so give them a break, and as you can see nowadays most of these child actors came to be talented actors. Second, In my opinion, it was a plus that the movie was kept faithful to the storyline of the book.

","Much like the film in said title, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone seems to essentially be a nice kind of kiddy escapism flick into the world of magic, but like The Wizard of Oz, it still manages to be surprisingly touchy in a profoundly humanistic kind of way despite its far fetched story. <br/><br/>I grew up with these series, and thought they were the greatest thing i have ever seen at the time. Now that i have grown older and judge all cinematic feats objectively, Sorcerer's Stone might have lost some of its figurative magic, but it is still an impressive and genuinely entertaining film. After having recently been through the torture of seeing the entire Twilight saga series, it is nice to see a film series such as Harry Potter that DOES actually have great writing and for the most part good acting, and manages to be believeable in the setting it provides. Dumbledore, who is the most important character in the film, and his dialogue with Harry in front of the mirror shows us that the film manages to still be relevant to actual family values and issues while subtly lying under its gorgeous magical cover. <br/><br/>Visually the film is stunning due to the fact that the filmmakers wanted to give it that authentic look, resulting in many on location shots. The outdoor shot of the first time seeing Hogwharts is simply visual delight in what could have easily been an ugly CGI snoozefest. The great hall ( Which was not on location and actually built for the film ) is also fantastic visual beauty, and the high camera angles show us a great overview of the entire room while this is coupled with John Williams's fantastic score, which uses fantastic chords of joy and happiness in the light hearted scenes while still maintaining that ominous mystery feel in the darker scenes, such as the Unicorn search in the dark forest. Williams's score for this film is definitely one of the greatest in the history of film due to the fact that it captures the adventure, joy, mystery & evil of the film like no other. <br/><br/>Its three main characters Harry, Ron & Hermione, who were ofcourse still very young child actors at the time, are surprisingly genuinely enthusiastic and natural about the happenings in the film, and while they will never be the true star of it, they definitely do not drag the film down. However, there are indeed fantastic acting performances in the film, especially by Alan Rickman ( Snape ) whose subtle slow way of speaking is intimidating in its own right, and Richard Harris ( Dumbledore ), who captures the wise and friendly aspect of his character as only Harris can, with his calm demeanor and naturally fatherly character, which only makes it sadder he passed away before the making of the Prisoner of Azkaban, as a Dumbledore as good as Richard Harris's will never be seen.<br/><br/>The narrative of the film is great, with us slowly beginning to understand more about the plot as it unfolds. It doesn't insult any type of audience with obvious dialogue or flashbacks ( *Cough* Twilight * Cough* ) and instead lets the mystery unfold into logic on its own. All three main characters embody their characters perfectly as each is used to the best of their abilities throughout an event in the story, which will make sure none of them seem irrelevant, and all of them give a clear view of what they are like.<br/><br/>It is a grandiose spectacle of visuals and magic, and while obviously lacking in real depth it is also a genuinely human story about an orphan ( Harry ) who finds friendship and courage through a series of brave events."

","Now I can't compare this to the books and I don't plan to. I feel as if comparing an IP to a book, which is a lot longer and can go into far deeper detail is unfair and I feel as if it's only fair to review it as itself<br/><br/>With that said, the film has a lot of redeeming qualities. The set design is beautiful, costume design great and it explains how the world in which it takes place in works. The visual effects don't really hold up compared to modern standards, but are still done very well for it's time. The story itself is just purely alright and the acting from the children and adults are good. But the dialogue could use some work. Now, The ending is the largest reason why I can't give this film an 8. As they venture to get the sorcerers stone, they use their skills and knowlage that they learned along the way to make their way through. Hermonies used her knowlage of creatures to get them out of the Devil's Snare plant, Harry, as the seeker of the Griffindor team, grabs the key to unlock the door to the next room, and Weasley using his knowlage of Chess to beat the chess board and get Harry into the room with the stone. Harry gets into the room and Quirrel is the person trying to get the stone with Voldemort living inside of him as a sort of parasite. And as Quirrel attacks him, what is the thing that saves Harry? The spells he learned to help defend him against the dark arts? Nope, love, the worst and laziest excuse for a power that will stop the enemy. An interesting battle could have happened, but for me the climax was just lazy and boring. And then in the end when they award the house cup, Dumbledore got Slytherin all hyped to win but then he awards points at the last minute, I thought that was really weird. A pretty solid movie with a very meh ending"

","I liked all the Harry Potter movies, but the first one still remains my favourite. I remember always wanting to see this movie on screen as a child, and when I finally got the chance to see it, I enjoyed every moment of it from start to finish! Before I actually saw the movie, I remember one of my teachers reading the book to my entire class, and I just enjoyed listening into the story. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone just brings back the most memories out of all the Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>The great thing about this movie was how all of the characters were introduced, and that was important because the characters will further develop later into this movie, as well into the movies that followed.<br/><br/>The story or plot was very good and interesting to follow. It was important that the first movie starts on a good note otherwise the following movies would just struggle, and this is what the Philosopher's Stone did.<br/><br/>Whether this one is the best movie or not is debatable, but one thing for sure is that it does remain a favourite for many Harry Potter fans: it certainly is my favourite."

","This is a fun, though flawed movie. I'm not a big fan of this franchise, but this is a pretty good movie. <br/><br/>Characters - This is one of few movies that have good child actors. The characters themselves are also pretty well-written. I'm not saying I like all the characters, but they are well-written and portrayed. <br/><br/>Plot - This story is full of holes and inconsistencies. Maybe some stuff is explained in the books, I haven't read then, but very little is explained in the movies. That's not to say that the movies aren't interesting, but if you are the type of person who likes it when there are established rules in movies, avoid this franchise. <br/><br/>Sights and Sounds - This movie looks great.

","This movie was amazing. However, if it was not based on a book, I would have given it a much better score. The movie did not follow certain major aspects of the book, including how Harry met Malfoy, and Voldemort flying instead of Slithering. The acting was amazing, especially for kids, but the camera angles were some of the worst in any big budget live action movie I've ever seen. The scenes on the train practically gave me whiplash because it appeared as though they could only show one character at a time. Watch the train scene again to see what I mean.

","It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful. Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell. Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable: Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation. <br/><br/>The additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch). From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone. A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here. An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages. A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies. I rate this one 7/10."
"mistoppi","6","0","1","15 October 2016"," Great children's fantasy
","Chris Columbus has mostly directed movies for the whole family. His imprint is clear. The first Harry Potter movie is clearly a very childlike fantasy. It's mostly aimed for children, and no one's trying to hide it. Sure, people of all ages can watch it, and the book isn't just meant for kids, but the movie is just so clearly meant for children, which can make it slightly annoying. But it's fascinating to see how that changes when the series goes on. The movies change a lot considering their target audience was growing up the whole time, and they eventually look like a dark young adult fantasy instead of this colourful fantasy for children..<br/><br/>This first movie adaptation annoys me so much. They've followed the book closely, some lines are straight from the book. Yet so much is missing. So many important details are gone. Of course not everything can make it to the film but still it bothers many viewers who have read the books. Also even if the movie is long it seems to happen so fast. <br/><br/>It's an entertaining movie but after so any years they lose some of their magic. It's sad, of course, but it's mostly the fault of the audience (in this case, me) and not the movies."
"Leofwine_draca","7","0","1","3 August 2016"," Gem of a children's film and a fine adaptation of the Rowling novel
","Over-hyped but still enjoyable ""event"" movie, one of the biggest of 2001 until LORD OF THE RINGS comes out, and a film in which every million of the budget is put up on screen in the special effects. What I found most refreshing about this blockbuster is that the entire cast is made up of British actors and actresses! It makes a change for an expensive blockbuster movie to be thus but there you go, HARRY POTTER is indeed a unique movie. Now I'm not one of those people with lots of time on their hands to read the never-ending Harry Potter books (too busy watching cult movies I'm afraid), but the film has turned out pretty much as I would have expected from the adverts. Although it's overly sentimental (blame it on director Chris Columbus) and aimed at children, adults can still enjoy it for the excellent pacing (rarely does the two-and-a-half hour running time drag) and the plethora of special - and some not so special - effects on view throughout.<br/><br/>Highlights include an attack in the school's toilets by a huge, lumbering troll, a life size game of chess in which the pieces come to life to destroy each other, a cloak of invisibility, a man with two faces on opposite sides of his head, and the finale which includes a scene of a man disintegrating into dust as a homage to Hammer's Dracula and is just as impressive. The CGI effects are elaborate and generally flawless, and the only ones I didn't care for were the ""broomstick flying"" shots in the quidditch game which still ended up looking a little too fake for my liking, which is a shame as they're used excessively. Otherwise the effects work is phenomenal and something to be seen.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe takes on the rather subdued role of Potter, and is overshadowed by two excellent performances from Rupert Grint as the lovably cheeky Ron and Emma Watson as the bossy Hermione. The supporting cast are generally excellent, with fine turns from Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore, Robbie Coltrane as the giant Hagrid (whose weight bizarrely fluctuates throughout the movie), John Cleese - briefly - as an unsuccessful ghost, Nearly Headless Nick, John Hurt as a wand dealer, Richard Griffiths as Harry's unpleasant uncle, and most of all Alan Rickman with a sinisterly villainous performance of Gothic dread - nobody can be a bad guy like Rickman can. Cameos from the likes of Julie Walters, Fiona Shaw, Zoe Wanamaker, and even Warwick Davis (which surely had to be a step up from LEPRECHAUN 5 or whatever his last film was) as a goblin are endless and a delight.<br/><br/>HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE may be a kid's film, but there's enough going on here to make it an enjoyable viewing experience for adults who plan to watch the film with their kids as well. Lots of plot, interesting and original characters, refreshingly old-fashioned moral codes, some fine sets which skilfully mix old and new-style worlds, an effective score, special effects which seamlessly blend in with the story and above average acting help to make this a gem of a movie and a cut above the rest."
"alindsay-al","7","0","1","27 July 2016"," A good introduction to this universe
","In preparation for the upcoming fantastic beasts and where to find them I have decided that I am finally going to watch the harry potter films starting with this one. The premise sees an 11 year old boy who's parents were wizards invited to a magic school called Hogwarts. Daniel Radcliffe plays harry potter and he gives a truly fantastic kid performance. You see the innocence in his character but you also see the strength he has that make him the interesting character that he is in this film. Rupert grint plays Ron weasley and Emma Watson plays hermione granger as Harry's two best friends and they are both really good in this film as well. They are both fun characters who have good chemistry together and with harry as they go on their journey and it is fun. Robbie Coltrane plays hagrid who gets harry to Hogwarts and is a mentor to our group of wizards and a lovable character. Maggie smith plays one of the teachers and she does a really good job being a good motherly figure to harry. The late Alan Rickman plays snape one of the teachers and gives one of the more interesting performances in the film as he seems to be antagonistic towards harry but he has more to him as a character. The story has a great introduction into the wizard world and a pretty personal story for harry as he tries to get over his parents situation and his introduction to Hogwarts. However, this film is quite long and there are allot of filler in the plot which means it takes too long to get into the interesting plot of the film. The script has some fun dialogue in it that builds the friendship between the characters. However, because if their young age sometimes the drama doesn't come across that well which is a negative for this film. The style has some decent special effects and cgi especially during the quiditch game. However, the film does have some pacing issues and some of the cgi does look pretty dated now. Overall this is a decent film that does a good job in getting you excited for the sequels."
"gollumsmeagolrocks","9","0","2","22 May 2016"," Hasn't aged like a fine wine, but still a real treat
","I must say, the significant flaw with this film is it doesn't know whether to provide more more attention to setting up the entire fictional universe or the main plot of this installment. It does contain mostly exposition, which wouldn't be a bad thing if it wasn't so present that the main plot of the movie felt awkward with the rest of it, as it has so little presence and doesn't relate much to Harry learning about the Wizarding World. <br/><br/>The world-building is strong, it just doesn't fit snugly with the plot of the Philpsopher's Stone, which almost feels like a subplot due to how little of a presence it has. It feels like an abrupt interruption from what feels like the main plot in world-building when it IS brought up, as they talk about Harry getting on the Quiddich team, but then suddenly go off on this unrelated tangent about Gringotts being robbed from a newspaper headline. It's much more awkward when it happens in the Dark Forest, as they're there for detention and just run into SPOILER who wants the Stone by mere coincidence.<br/><br/>But other than that, the film is still entertaining. It's mainly thanks to the teachers that the film stands up as entertaining still, as Hagrid, McGonagall, Snape and Dumbledore are all interesting characters. It's just a bit weird that the actual main plot of the movie is reduced to a very minimal presence in the film in favor of the introduction to the universe as a whole. Overall, this is the Harry Potter film I think stands the test of time as the least re-watchable. After all, once you're introduced to the universe and already know how things work it does feel somewhat like a long wait to get to the bits about the Stone. Still a good film by all means, and it really shows how much Steve Kloves has grown as a writer considering he has written every other FANTASTIC film in the franchise except ""Order Of The Phoenix"""

","So it's the one that started it all - also known as ""the one you can't really criticise because it started it all"". In other words, it makes me feel awful to have to say something negative about what is a good start to possibly the greatest film franchise of all time. But I want to be objective. So, I'll try to just get the negatives out the way firstly and quickly: the film definitely has not aged well. Its PS2-worthy graphics are sometimes laughable, particularly in the troll and Quidditch sequences. In addition, the film sometimes struggles to cram everything into the short space it has - for example, that the first act with the Dursleys is so short is both a curse and a blessing: we don't get to experience the nitty-gritty early years of abuse suffered by Harry that is so well documented in the books - but on the other hand, it just means we get to the magic of Hogwarts so much faster. And finally, on a negative point, its decidedly light and almost twee tone makes it very much child-friendly, but may cause the adults to lose interest now and then. I'm sorry, but these things had to be said.<br/><br/>But let's face it - who cares? To anyone who's never seen or read Harry Potter before, this is the compulsory stepping stone in what turns out to be a most magnificent journey. So brilliantly crafted by Columbus and of course Rowling, Philosopher's Stone features some of the best acting talent Britain has to offer - special mentions going to Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, the late Richard Harris and, in particular, Alan Rickman as Snape - the role he was born to play. The sets depict almost exactly what any reader has ever imagined, and the kids - well - they're pretty bloody cute.<br/><br/>Philosopher's Stone is not the best - it's just a taste test. What happens next is delicious."

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001): Dir: Chris Columbus / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane: Stunning visual achievement and a triumph in production. Every inch of this film sparks something new and exciting. Unfortunately it views witchcraft as exciting as oppose to dangerous. It opens with the death of Harry's parents and the scar embedded on his forehead. Story follows his ventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Filled with great imagery such as invisible cloaks, giant ogres, centors, flying brooms, moving staircases, giant chess games, and a three-headed dog named Fluffy. What is truly remarkable is how it tells a story without surrendering to the visuals. Unfortunately Harry uses vengeful magic to aid his concluding victory as oppose to natural resources. Inspiring work by director Chris Columbus who is a champion with box office hits. His previous successes include Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone. Daniel Radcliffe is perfectly cast as Harry companioned with Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as friends he meets on a train to Hogwarts. Richard Harris plays the compelling wizard Dumbledore. Robbie Coltrane plays a friendly giant like character whose dog is of an unusual breed. This film sets the stage introducing the school but it is not for young children who need no class in sorcery.

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone was released in 2001, and Daniel Radcliffe was starred in all the film in the Harry Potter series. Chris Columbus directed this fantasy movie based on the novel 'Harry Potter' by J. K. Rowling. Harry Potter shows the purity of children and gives us a chance to look back on our lives. We can see the kind of magic we could imagine when we were children such as making something floating in the sky, getting in a car which can fly in the sky, and magic that can make someone or something invisible.<br/><br/>The film is set in Hogwarts, where Harry Potter is a young wizard. When Harry Potter was a child, his family abused him by forcing him to do many chores. One day, he gets an admission card from Hogwarts. The card is the beginning of the new life for him and his new best friends, Hermione Granger and ""Ron"" Weasley, with magic, professors, and new world. Harry Potter enters a new dormitory called Gryffindor. While getting to know about school life and experiencing the life, he realizes there's something going on in Hogwarts related to a stone hidden in the school. He starts to dig out the truth about the secret. Finally, he faces a dangerous situation.<br/><br/>The set of Harry Potter is a magnificent castle which is big enough to accommodate all the student. Students can take a class and even fly with their broomsticks in the castle. Furthermore, this wonderful castle is combined with special effects including monsters, magic, and many wizards. When Harry Potter flies with his broomstick, the castle looks marvelous and made me think I'm definitely going there before I die. Of course, inside the castle, the classroom seems really antique and huge. In addition to this, the hall where students usually gather and have breakfast, lunch, and dinner with beautiful sky made by magic is the perfect place for making students want to study.<br/><br/>With the wonderful set and magic, Harry Potter gives us whole new fantasy. While watching this movie, we could escape from our daily lives. This could give us a relaxing time and the energy which may help us face our problems with a fresh perspective."

","This film is an adaptation of the first book of Harry Potter's saga, written by the British author J.K. Rowling. Directed by Chris Columbus, a man with experience in making films for young audiences (""Home Alone"" is paradigmatic), this film has a very young cast led by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, in the roles of the apprentices wizards Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, while also features veterans actors of the British theater and cinema, as Richard Harris (in one of his last appearances in movies before his death), Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane, in the roles of Professor Dumbledore, school's headmaster, his main collaborator, Professor McGonagall and the school's gamekeeper, Hagrid.<br/><br/>This film marks the start of one of the most acclaimed and profitable franchises in the twenty-first century cinema, where several acting careers met its beginning or end. The film practically doesn't have a single negative note: he managed to pick up a book that was already a huge success and amplify it astronomically without sacrificing its authenticity. Anyone who has read the book recognizes it in this film and sees the book's magic gaining life, body and shape. The special effects, the details of the scenario, the costumes (any similarity between the school robes and the traditional black cloaks of university students of Portugal is not a mere coincidence, since Rowling lived in Portugal and has even married a Portuguese) all contribute to make us feel that this movie is the book we read and we have on our hands. Phenomenal, one of the best adaptations of a novel."
"byson5186","9","0","2","2 September 2015"," Good, But There Are Better Stories
","Harry Potter has no doubt, played a role in Pop Culture especially for books and movies. I find it very hard to believe as I'm sure most of you also find it hard to believe that this first movie came out almost 14-years ago. Where has all the time gone? I guess we're done with Harry Potter books since 2007, and Harry Potter movies since 2011. Harry Potter doesn't seem so much a part of Pop Culture anymore. I'd say the movies in Pop Culture now, are Jurassic World, Hunger Games, and Frozen. People remember Harry Potter, but I don't see that much Harry Potter franchise or people talking about it so much anymore. You will occasionally find the Harry Potter films on TV, like ABC Family where they occasionally have Harry Potter marathons.<br/><br/>I think the story about how Harry Potter was written is interesting. Let's think about it, the lady who wrote Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling was poor and living off of welfare. The story she wrote was even rejected numerous times before finally being published. It obviously had been a huge success after hitting the bookshelves and with each new copy. There'd even be countdowns at bookstores right as the new books were coming out, back in the days before we had iPhones and when bookstores were more common. J.K. Rowling has become like the second richest lady in England, only behind the Queen Of England. I'd say that shows a story of success, and not giving up.<br/><br/>Despite all this, while Harry Potter is a good story I'd say it's overrated and there are better stories. I definitely don't think that J.K. Rowling should be the second richest lady in England just for writing a kids book, but Harry Potter has obviously appealed to kids and adults, my aunt has read them. I have to say, there are better written fictional stories where the writer hasn't been as well known or made nearly as much money. I've grown up liking DragonBall Z. I even hear people talking more about DragonBall Z, and wearing DragonBall Z clothes than Harry Potter. I worked at Amazon, and I would often times see DragonBall Z franchise there more so than Harry Potter. That's a good, more action packed story of Good Versus Evil than Harry Potter. It also is a story with lots of varieties of character like Human/Saiyan compared to Muggle/Wizzard. I'd have a lot more fun having a DragonBall Z marathon than Harry Potter marathon.<br/><br/>Japan has come up with other good stories. Like, I used to watch Power Rangers as a kid not knowing the show was using footage from a Japanese show, Zyuranger. It would have been hard to see Zyuranger back then in America. But, years later I have the DVDs, and I can't help but think about how much better Zyuranger is than Power Rangers. Japan also had another TV show come out in 1988 that is probably more remembered in Brazil called Sekai Ninja Sen Jiraiya, a good TV show. A lot of video game characters originated in Japan, like Zelda and Mario. In terms of writing Super Hero stories, no country beats Japan. No country also beats Japan in making video games.<br/><br/>I also used to read the 39 Clues books which were my favorite books for awhile, and I'd say better than Harry Potter. I wonder if they'll make a movie out of them. But, one movie I feel is WAY UNDERRATED is a movie called Earth To Echo. That is such a happy adventurous movie, while it's not my favorite movie I'd consider it THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE. My favorite movie is called Junior High Spy. The main character in that movie, Ricky Lazio is a cooler character than Harry Potter. His sidekick Jack is a much funnier character than Ron. Ricky's love interest, Kylie is less stuck up, and more pleasant than Hermione.<br/><br/>So, what I'm saying is while Harry Potter is a clever and good story it doesn't beat other stories mentioned above where the writers didn't become billionaires. So, Harry Potter is definitely overrated, and I'm saying it because of the movies. I feel like the movies do a great job in portraying Hogwarts, and bringing the Harry Potter characters to life. But, these movies while interesting are long dark 2+ hour movies where I feel like can be slow at times and have lots of Go Pee moments. A lot of the Harry Potter movies don't entertain me that much. They're not like DragonBall Z, where I could flip through scenes in the DVDs, and then want to keep watching. It's still entertaining.<br/><br/>So, while this review might be more of Harry Potter as a whole I'll briefly talk about the movie. I like this movie, as it takes us back to the introduction of Harry Potter/Hogwarts. It brings us back to the excitement of the introduction, and when the characters were younger and had higher voices. Also, when they had the House Cup which seems forgotten in the later books/movies. I also feel like the climax in this movie is like the most exciting climax, well the climax in the 4th is pretty exciting. The chess scene, and finding the right key were exciting scenes. This movie is truly a great fun way to introduce us to the first year at Hogwarts and the Harry Potter excitement. <br/><br/>I'd probably now give the movie a 7 or 8, but since I put a 9 on this movie many years ago, I'll leave it at 9."
"barbagvido","7","0","1","31 August 2015"," Classic!
","The very beginning of a classic film franchise that many people (including me) call a big part of their childhood. When I was a kid, I loved this movie and watched it over and over again. I probably know all the lines in the movie. Then, when I was 14, I watched it again and this time, after reading the book (which is awesome, by the way) and while I enjoyed it as always because all the beautiful memories I get, I found some flaws. Most of them are about differences from the book but we can all say this part is one of the most faithful ones to the book. I will not say much about child actors considering that they were still unexperienced.Looking at them, I must say Emma Watson did the best job as Hermione Granger and Tom Felton was also really good as Draco Malfoy and he just makes you want to punch him in the face which is a good thing looking at his character. Now about adult actors. I think Maggie Smith did the best job as Harry's strict but awesome professor McGonagall. And I'll have to mention Alan Rickman that was really intimidating as professor Snape. I will not mention cast anymore because in my opinion everyone did good. Effects were fine for early 2000s but it doesn't look so good today. But there are some scenes that are still as thrilling as in 2001. But the most brilliant thing in this film is John Williams' beautiful score which totally brings me back to childhood and makes everything more magical. So, when you put everything together, it's a really entertaining fantasy every family should watch and the start of a great adventure."

","The first Harry Potter film does a great job in introducing us to all the main characters that are important throughout the franchise. It is a wonderful movie that has great cinematography, surprisingly great acting coming from really young kids and just a sense of wonder, adventure and imagination throughout.<br/><br/>I believe the movie truly is a treat especially for fans of the book, since the film is extremely faithful to it. The only real flaw I think this movie has is the fact that it was filmed during a very experimental time in the CGI-ERA and most of the CGI looks pretty bad and dated. I am not kidding there are many scenes in the movie, that looking closely, it looks just like a cartoon.<br/><br/>However, this rather small flaw does not affect the movie's plot, nor its magic and it certainly cannot hide the fact that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an amazing movie that introduces us to a beautiful and magical world."

","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is the starting movie in one huge and magical film franchise based on the books of the same name. This film for me was good, not great I must add but one movie that truly shows us something new and makes people just generally happy afterwards. It isn't awesome by any stretch of the imagination and I'll go into that later on but this does at least set a bench mark in film, one that started one of the biggest film franchises of all time.<br/><br/>The movie is a nice mix between a kind of light and lovely kind of thing, but then dark and oddly scary in certain ways. The movie is for the most part heart-warming and gives you a beautiful sense of ""I'm there"" kind of feeling and one which instantly connects you with the characters. The plot can have it's more terrifying moments and especially maybe for the young viewers, a certain scene including the Forbidden Forest comes to mind on that one. <br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are not great as our main heroes but they're not bad either actually, they don't really know how to act just yet but they still regain that nice sweet feeling about them which is all that counts here. The whole cast is a plethora of greats, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris and many others contribute to the great cast who just make this film really what it is and make it all importantly, fun.<br/><br/>It's possible as they say, that Christopher Columbus the director stuck too close to the books here and really should have deviated from the scenes which well, only work in the book. I applaud him for staying true but I have to say the film is over long and stuffed full of long periods where very little happens and that can at times make this seem slightly dull. I do like Columbus here though, I think he directs well and Steve Kloves adapts the screenplay pretty well too, yet again good all round.<br/><br/>Now one thing that may not be most remembered but for me should are the special effects which for the day are really great and make this so much more exciting at times. Certain scenes just wouldn't work without them being good and the team behind it seem to create a visually good looking film too. Staying on the way this looks the sets are magnificent and truly incredibly done, on such a large scale it is difficult but they pull it off and first time as well. <br/><br/>I felt this film is like an epic that is both for adults and kids and that is for me what sets this apart from other such movies in the fantasy genre. It shouldn't leave anyone feeling negative afterwards and really makes you kind happy in a way that leaves you positive about the whole movie and is another reason this is so memorable. It's hard to not fall in love with the Harry Potter world, the film not so much but the thing it is set in, very much so.<br/><br/>Overall a good movie and also one that kick-starts a huge franchise of films that are so remembered and will be for me, in years to come. It's the kind of movie that isn't great but is still a classic in senses, so many people around the world can quote it and words and phrases from this movie continue to be used in everyday speech, just magically wonderful."

","Now the reason I make that statement is because you have to be a fan of Harry Potter to have enjoy this movie or you have to be a fan of wizard movies to better enjoy.<br/><br/>I remember seeing this movie in theaters with family members that I didn't hang out with much and I remember how cold it was outside in the theater but when we went inside the movie theater room to watch the film it was really hot. So much so that I wanted the movie to be done as soon as possible because I remember being miserable in the hot room.<br/><br/>Now onto the movie I never read any of the Harry Potter books nor have I even heard of this movie until I saw it in theaters. <br/><br/>So the film does have a good cast of actors and they did perform very well in the movie. The plot from what I can tell follows the events of the book and the characters seem to have follow the same way as they are in the book<br/><br/>There are some cool effects in the film that make you go wow but a few that only fans would understand<br/><br/>Music in the film matches the movie and it works to help telling the story. <br/><br/>It just the film to me was a bit confusing and didn't make a fan out of me. It just some of the scenes in the movie leave me scratching my head so this film would only be more for the fans of Harry Porter while it does something for someone who enjoy this series of movies it just one of those love/hate ordeals <br/><br/>I give Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone an 7 out of 10"

","I love this movie. I was too young to watch it when it came out, I was only four, but when I was old enough to watch it, I just loved it so much. It's so good. The storyline, acting, effects and music are all great. This Harry Potter film is probably my third favorite behind, Goblet Of Fire and Deathly Hallows: Part Two. Which isn't bad, third favorite out of eight movies. If you ever have a Harry Potter-thon, which I do, strap yourself in, because your in for almost twenty hours of amazement.<br/><br/>This movie is all about Harry Potter. Orphaned as a baby, his abusive Aunt and Uncle took him in and raised him. But he has to sleep in a tiny closet under the stairs, so he's not very thankful. He starts to realize that he can do things, things that others can't. He starts getting letters in the mail that his Uncle immediently tares up. They end up moving to a rock in the middle of the sea, a lighthouse, I think. On his eleventh birthday, Harry gets a visit from Hagrid who informs him that he's a wizard. Hagrid then takes Harry away from the ""family"" and tells him all about him. About he's the most famous wizard alive. After finding this out, he is taken to Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry, where he meets Ron and Hermione, and they all learn to start being magical together. But then an evil that everyone assumed was dead, comes back to haunt Harry. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing."

","Harry Potter Is simply astonishingly perfect. It's clear to see that everyone Involved, from Author to Producer, from Actor to Fan, all have nothing but love for the Harry Potter franchise. Just like myself, many people grew up with Harry Potter, and If you didn't grow to love the franchise more and more by each film, then there's definitely something wrong. <br/><br/>I literally could write 100 reasons why you should watch the Harry Potter franchise, so do yourself favor and start where it all began with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone! To this day, I still appreciate the effort and passion what went into the first film, and believe me It doesn't stop there. What JK. Rowling created is without a doubt, Outstanding! From Chocolate frogs to a Nimbus 2000, this film brings a new meaning to fantasy, It's simply magical.<br/><br/>If your like me and have read the books, you will appreciate how close the film franchise stuck to the books story line. Each character looks and acts as they were described. It's somewhat heart warming to see your favorite characters up on a big screen, you can see the passion that they have, and the love they also have for their characters. Harry Ron & Hermione are portrayed SO SO well, they defiantly did their research when deciding on who played what character. For me tho, the music and art of the world Is unbeatable and the best thing there is about this film. It gives you a false sense that the world Is real and Magic does actually exist!<br/><br/>I literally cannot describe every positive thing about this film, the list would go on and on and I cannot compare anything to magical feeling you get when watching these films.

"squirrel_burst","7","0","1","24 November 2014"," A little rough around the edges, but in the long run you won't mind
","""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" (Or Sorcerer's stone depending on your region) introduces a complicated world filled with a lot of ideas and characters. It isn't perfect and it's obvious that as the first instalment, it was unclear to the director and screenwriter as to what would work and what wouldn't. Sometimes it follows the novel too closely with some characters and ideas that overall could have been left out (the ghosts for example, do not play an important part in this first story) and at times it's awkward to have us bounce quickly in-between all of the classes the students attend. However, it does a good job of introducing us to this world, it has a lot of really memorable moments, a great cast and there's a lot of imagination here (some from the movie, some from the original book). I wouldn't say that my love for the Harry Potter series, both the films and the books influence me when I say that this is a good movie. It's a humble beginning to a series of films that's sure to become essential viewing and a lot of people's favourite for years to come. (Theatrical version on the big screen, August 17, 2012)"
"msloane1","8","0","1","5 November 2014"," A Magical Beginning
","I am huge fan of the Harry Potter series. On a 5 star scale I would give 6 of the 7 books in the series (all except Goblet) 5 stars. And when it comes to rating this movie, I would it give it a 10 if I were judging it based strictly on how much I enjoyed it. That said, I think on a 10 star scale the most accurate rating for the movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is 8. The movie is reasonably faithful to the book. And some of the decisions about how to transfer the story from book to film worked incredibly well. For example, the opening chapter of the book is a chapter of crucial importance. But this scene could not be allowed to drag on for 15-20 minutes in the film. A balance had to be struck between respecting the importance of this chapter and condensing it for time and space. The film struck this balance masterfully by eliminating Uncle Vernon's day and only showing Harry's arrival scene. Since that ""day"" was really more Uncle Vernon's story than Harry's it was able to be cut without doing any damage and what's left focuses on Harry's story as it should. Plus, cinematically, it worked well to have that whole opening scene set at night. This kind of good decision making was present throughout most of the book to movie transition. The only real flaw is that the main version of the film omits the scene where Harry finds Flammel on the back of the chocolate frog card before Hermione goes to retrieve the book. Hermione going to retrieve the book makes far more sense of the scene of Harry finding Flammel on the chocolate frog card before that is included. This is a deleted scene but it should have been in the main movie. Overall the book is reasonable faithful to the book. The casting is bloody brilliant. Robbie Coltraine and Alan Rickman were PERFECT for the roles of Hagrid and Snape. You can almost feel Hagrid's warmth through the screen when you watch this movie. As you expect, Richard Harris was a great Dumbledore, wonderfully capturing the grandfatherly mentor from the books. It's a shame he didn't live long enough to complete the series because he was so awesome in the role. Daniel and Emma do show some noviceness in this movie but their subsequent performances in the later films proved the casting correct. The special effects and visuals were mixed in this film and are by far the weakest in the series. On one hand, the filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing things like Qudditch, the Great Hall, and the Hogwarts Express to life. On the other hand some of the CGI was too cartoonish. Fluffy isn't scary at all and the troll is downright comical. The best part of the filmmaking was John Williams score. John Williams should have won the Academy Award for Best Original Score for this movie. This is some of the best music I've ever heard. And it's so identifiable. You here this and it instantly puts you in mind of Harry Potter. And the pacing is outstanding. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an engaging and engrossing movie from start to finish and has very few slow moments. And as the most charming, innocent, and light hearted film in the series, this movie is great for kids. <br/><br/>Faithfulness to the book: 8 out 10. Casting/acting: 8 out of 10. Music: 10 out of 10. Pacing 10 out of 10. Special effects visuals: 6 out of 10. Overall; 8 out of 10."

","Even though the others adaptations of Harry Potter's novels weren't all successfully brought to the screen, this first movie is undoubtedly a great success and probably the best of the whole cinematographic Harry Potter's saga. The scenarist Steve Kloves succeeded in remaining faithful to JK Rowling's book, whereas the director Chris Columbus managed to make us enter in this magical world with delighted child's eyes, and sort of realism. From the beginning, we are moved by this young boy starved of affection who suddenly discovers he is a wizard. We are out of breath too when Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry appears for the first time in front of us, and we shiver of course when Harry Potter finally faces the dark wizard. The magical universe JK Rowling created, his creatures and his lovable characters just can't leave you without any feelings : Harry Potter's friends are your friends, and his enemies are yours as well ! This film is an excellent movie to watch with the whole family, however the next movies become darker and darker and are gradually aimed at an older audience.

","Right, this review is a review of the film. Not the book. Not how true the film is to the book. Just a review, of the film. I have read the book but it was a very long time ago and I have seen this movie so many times I have forgotten what was in the book and what wasn't. This movie, for me, is fantastic. Let me start by saying that this film, or any of the Harry Potter films, is not a children's film. Of course they appeal to children and are marketed as such but they are certainly appreciated & enjoyed by adults.<br/><br/>The story is well known and probably doesn't need overviewing again but I will do so anyway! As a toddler, Harry Potter is left on the doorstep of his Aunties & Uncles by Dumbledore. The story then skips forward 9 years or so and Harry is being treated as a Slave almost, an outcast by his family. He sleeps in a cupboard under the stairs, is bullied by his cousin & waits on his Auntie & Uncle hand and foot. As Harry nears his 11th Birthday, post with Harrys name on it starts arriving day after day until one day it arrives in its thousands. Scared by this his Auntie & Uncle take them away to a secluded cabin for a 'holiday'. Here, Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid meets them & informs Harry that he is a wizard and is to enrol at Hogwarts School. The rest of the story pans out with Harry at School, growing up fast, making friends & even enemies.<br/><br/>This film is pure magic. It transports to viewer to a land which is in every way possible, very believable. The sets, the acting & the effects are all first rate. The Acting in particular (on the most part) is absolutely spot on. Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermione), Robbie Coltrane (Hargrid) & Maggie Smith (McGonagall) are all outstanding. The late Richard Harris (Dumbledore) & the late Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon) also put in fantastic performances as well. My favourite character has to be Severus Snape, played by Alan Rickman. His performance as that character is faultless. My only gripe, is Harry Potter himself, played by Daniel Radcliffe. As far as acting is concerned, he is leagues behind the majority of other main actors. His acting may appear worse than it is as he is alongside some of the greatest British actors at this present time. Finding the lead actor poor should really bring the film down but with its fantastic array of other actors make up for it somewhat.<br/><br/>Harry Potter & The Philosophers Stone is a fantastic film that appeals to all ages. The storyline is fantastic, the pace is just right & the character building is certainly a large aspect of this film and sets it up perfectly for the following movies.<br/><br/>With the run time at just fewer than 2 and half hours it does not, for one second, feel like it is dragging its heels. The whole feature transports you to literally, another world and keeps you lost in it until the credits role. This is not my favourite of the Harry Potter franchise, it isn't even in my top 3 and that speaks volumes about my very high rating.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Chris Columbus' Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (aka Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) is a masterpiece to it's genre, and the only franchise in movie history to contain eight movies. the movie itself as you already know focuses on the character of Harry Potter (played by a young Daniel Radcliffe)whose parents get killed while he was just a baby then he gets taken by his aunt and uncle (played by Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw) who neglected him and only cared for their only son, then after all his mail got burned by his uncle Vernon he was taken to Hogwarts academy for witchcraft and wizardry by Rubeus Hagrid (played by Robbie Coltrane). While Potter is on the way to Hogwarts academy by train he makes two new friends one named Ron Weasley (played by Rupert Grint) and the other a girl named Hermione Granger (played by Emma Watson).The professors at the academy have very interesting personalities such as Prof. Albus Dumbledore (played by Richard Harris), Prof. Snake (played by Alan Rickman) and Prof. McGonogal (played by Maggie Smith).

"Tyson14","7","0","1","17 August 2014"," A faithful adaptation
","I will always think fondly of this movie because it inspired me to pick up the first Harry Potter book and I've been a rabid fan ever since. I'm one of those book before movie people so I had to read the novel in order to go see this movie and I was pleased to see that it was such a faithful adaptation to Rowling's wonderful tale.<br/><br/>This movie did a wonderful job of capturing the wonder and awe of the first HP novel. Hogwarts was an especially lovely effect and when Harry first walks into the Great Hall and all the candles are floating overhead, I felt all the magic I felt when reading those words on the page. I think Columbus and crew captured the essence of the castle and somehow managed to create a visual of something so fantastical.<br/><br/>The casting of the movie was also extremely well done. I adore Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Richard Harris captures the mischievous and wise nature of Dumbledore. Perhaps best of all the adult casting is that of Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. He looks exactly as I pictured the character but, more importantly, he captures Hagrid's rather childlike nature and the accent is wonderful. Coltrane doesn't just portray Hagrid, he is Hagrid.<br/><br/>I also thought the children were wonderfully cast. Daniel Radcliffe looks like Harry and I fought back tears when his earnest young face first looked into the Mirror of Erised. Rupert Grint looks just as I pictured Ron Weasley and Emma Watson is wonderfully bossy and a fantastic know-it-all as Hermione Granger. The casting of the Phelps brothers as the Weasley twins was absolutely brilliant and I think they were dead on in their interpretation of the lovable scoundrels.<br/><br/>Yet in spite of its fantastical nature, this film, like the book, feels as though it is something like our own reality. There are many wonderful things in Harry's world but it's not that different from our own. The same prejudices and the same human frailties that exist in our world exist in Harry's. Though being a wizard is pretty darn cool, it's not the answer to Harry's problems and the film makes clear that he has some difficult challenges ahead of him.<br/><br/>I think the central theme of this movie is one that is invaluable for both children and adults alike: that love is the most powerful magic that exists. Even with all the wand waving and fantastical creatures, it is love that is Harry's salvation."

","I remember when this first came out and I was totally amazed. The piles money put into this project were staggering; the excellent directing was flawless and the skills of such a young cast were unbelievably so professional. Before I continue, I did not read the books nor do I have any desire to. I am not a Potter-head. I have heard the movies were 'just OK' compared to the books. OK – I can deal with that, but I had a great time. If I enjoyed what I saw in the theater why would I destroy something I thoroughly destroyed? The first time I saw, 'The Sorcerer's Stone' I really enjoyed it. I did not write anything about it until I sat down and watched again the other day. After seeing it the second time I felt compelled to give this movie some kind of kudos. This is a very stunning and charming journey through a fantasy world which captured the entire world by storm. In my opinion this was the best of all the other installments. Why? I guess it's because everything was so new and the kidswell they were such cute little rascals. They were just itty-bitty things and waving around their magic sticks. How cool it that? I am not saying the early sequels were not bad they just didn't measure up to the freshness of the original. I will also have to say that the later oneswell the sell-by date had expired and the storyline was beginning to stink of political correctness. It is too bad the author's social views spilled into a perfectly good adventure series. But that is the choice of the stories' creator. I guess fame and money tends to unveil hubris and opinions. Maybe I am too hard on the Potter Saga, so I will give the entire series a fresh look and maybe I will adjust my thinking accordingly. As always, I go to a movie for entertainmentnot to be preached to."

","It's quite nostalgic to revisit the magical world of Harry Potter after so many years, yet surprising to discover that it still has a charming quality about itself. The first in the 8-part film series, Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone (also known as Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone) may not have the darkness or complexity of its later instalments but what it manages to retain is the freshness, innocence & excitement one feels when embarking on a new adventure.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone begins the journey of The Boy Who Lived and covers his adventures during his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. Completely oblivious to the world of magic as well as his famed celebrity status, the young Potter learns to adjust well at his new home & begins to prove his worth but soon realises that this magical world is far more dangerous for him than he imagined.<br/><br/>Directed by Chris Columbus, the film is a wonderful treat for kids & families plus as far as the screenplay goes, it remains pretty faithful to its source material. Cinematography beautifully captures the ambiance of Hogwarts, music by John Williams provides a magical feeling of its own & the visual effects clearly doesn't seem to have aged well over the years. Looking back, there are few moments which today seem pretty silly or stupid & unfortunately with every passing year, it's only going to get worse.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, there are performances ranging from pretty impressive to childish & annoying but I still have nothing to complain about the casting choices made here as not a single actor feels like a miscast in the story. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson do their part fine but it's Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane & Richard Harris who impress most in their respective roles of Severus Snape, Rubeus Hagrid & Albus Dumbledore.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone may not look as magical today as it was during its time of release but it's still a wonderful adaptation of J.K. Rowling's spellbinding world on the silver screen, which would later go on to become a cultural phenomenon of our time. And even though its story might be more aimed at younger audience, there are moments present in the film that will have even adults gazing at the screen with a childlike sense of wonder. Worth a watch? Definitely."

","Now a cultural phenomenon with a mature cast and a excellent representation of talent British filmmaking can offer, 'Harry Potter & The Philosopher's Stone' remains the latter, played by a fresh-faced trio we forget we first joined back in 2001. As such, their over emphasis and misplaced charisma can be forgiven, as it gives the original film a childish charm that is actually much appreciated, given that the later films in the series evolved with author J.K Rowling's darkening narative.<br/><br/>The best 'Harry Potter' plots play like a detective novel, with elements of whodunnit keeping readers guessing until the final reveal (this is also true of the overarching plot of the entire series). 'Philosopher's Stone' plays very well on this, with plenty of exposition from the young Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as they unconvincingly scratch their heads and pull the simplest of bemused expressions. Even a fan of the novels, who could recite every development of the plot from memory, can appreciate the intricacies of events as they gradually unfold through a two and a half hour runtime packed with set piece after impressive set piece. At the best of times, 'Philosopher's Stone' proves a great novel to adapt as it offers up Quidditch, mountain trolls and the group's first visit to the forbidden forest. At its worst, director Chris Columbus overcomes its episodic nature not by omitting vital material, but by ensuring a relentless pace and sense of adrenaline fill his film, as he makes great choices with his cuts, timing both those and his introduction to scenes with a keen eye for exactly what will grab and maintain the audience's attention.<br/><br/>An ensemble of seasoned veterans help the lead cast carry the weight of their film debut, with Alan Rickman proving perfect for master manipulator Severus Snape, and Dame Maggie Smith playing the sharper and softer sides of Professor Minerva McGonagall to great effect. Robbie Coltrain as Hagrid, Harry's half-giant ally, brings the comic relief in buckets. A mixture of practical effects and pioneering digital trickery make the film visually awe inspiring.<br/><br/>Sure to become an important antique of the British film industry, 'Harry Potter & The Philosopher's Stone' is a sumptuous extravaganza of special effects and a story brought to life on the screen in the most riveting way possible. It isn't the benchmark of the 'Harry Potter' series - or even of fantasy film - given the wooden nature of its lead cast. When, in the 2010s, the likes of Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz can give an Oscar-worthy performance at the same age, it is a slight shame that Radcliffe and Watson - Grint actually has great comic timing - hadn't quite honed their skills in the same manner by the age of ten. Later instalments would prove they were undoubtedly the right casting as their talents matured, but their forced performances in 'Philosopher's Stone' remain either a nostalgic charm for devoted fans, or something the casual viewer needs to overlook. Regardless, 'Philosopher's Stone' is excellent, and of course by some degree it is because of them alongside the countless others who made the adaptation what it is."

","With astonishing production values, terrific scripts and endlessly fascinating serial dramas, my contribution to the phenomenon of the HARRY POTTER films will just be a speck of glitter on the ten ton ball of chrome these films represent in movie history. Now that I have a box set of blu-ray DVDs, I am relishing them title by title as we watch them over and over again at home with and without kids on the lounge too. There are 1001 delights and moments to admire, and endless jaw-dropping visuals and imaginative tricks. Over and over again. However, it is the music scores that I am increasingly loving. Lush lavish orchestrations and endlessly inventive use of individual instruments, and soaring emotional oceans of music. Most acting chops are right, the casting deserves an Oscar of its own, every film, and the delight in seeing, film by film, each young actor journey through their teens to genuine human wonder. The almost seamless transfer of Dumbledore from Richard Harris to MIchel Gambon is not even noticed by the keenest of eyes. I especially liked the hideous Dobby being realized in ghastly character style Arthur Askey. The HP series is GONE WITH THE WIND for the 21st century in landmark film status. Everything works. I recently also saw Radcliffe in THE WOMAN IN BLACK which I thought also quite magnificent."

","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is simply magical. It is greatly acted and the sets are amazing! Daniel Radcliffe as the title role of Harry Potter is clearly nervous but pulls the part off very well. Rupert Grint as his friend Ron Weasley delivers his lines brilliantly and is a superb comedy role. Emma Watson as geek Hermione Granger steals the film, her fantastic acting and attitude is outstanding and you really can sympathise with her.<br/><br/>Other great cast members include Richard Harris as powerful Headmaster Professor Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as the strict Professor McGonagall and the always-brilliant Alan Rickman as the villainous Professor Snape.<br/><br/>The action scenes are very gripping. The troll scene in the Girls Bathroom is outstanding, the CGI perfect. The final scene with Professor Quirrell, played well by Ian Hart, is also very brilliantly done.<br/><br/>The Hogwarts Castle is almost exactly how I imagined it when I read the book, but it is Diagon Alley that is the best set I have ever seen. It is truly magical.<br/><br/>The only bad point about this film is that the Dursleys barely have a look in. The exquisite acting talents of Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw and Harry Melling needed more screen time. However, that is my only criticism.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie sets the standard highly for all of the other films to come."

Some of the style is still a little rough. The CGI isn't top notch, and the sets have some work to do. But those are minor drawbacks in an otherwise superb film.<br/><br/>The best part of it must be the great chemistry between the three young leads (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint). That is objective number one. With that accomplished, the rest is just icing on the cake.

","Though I enjoy the novels, the Harry Potter film adaptations have always been hit and miss affairs for me. Outside of about two of them, most of the entries in the movie franchise are either charmless and bland or stylish but incomprehensible to people who have not read the books. Sorcerer's Stone is in the former category.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus' ""whimsical"" direction is lifeless. The overly lit visuals are boring and the whole thing just feels like an exposition dump. The child actors give stiff performances (not coming into their own until about the third installment). The adults are a touch better but cannot do much with the awkward book to screen treatment. The only excellent aspect of the film is John Williams' score, which evokes the wonder, mystery, and warmth of the original book more than the actual movie does."

","I had a friend who worked at a movie theater during the releases of the first two Harry Potter movies who kept getting asked if he was hired as a look-alike for Harry Potter. He hated it. But that is not to say that he didn't like the movies, or at least the ones I know he watched.<br/><br/>Anyway, I loved these movies. I liked how we got to watch the characters grow. I mean why not, there were 8 movies covering 7 years of growth. We got to see the three main characters go from awkward pre-teens to very talented and strong adults.<br/><br/>In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone we meet all the characters. Well, the most important characters for the whole series and many others that played big part throughout. We meet other important characters in later movies that play important parts.<br/><br/>The graphics are great. I especially like when some of the different characters are shown flying broom sticks. I thought that having Hagrid driving a flying motorcycle with a sidecar was a nice touch. Speaking of Hagrid, I liked how the Special Effects Department made a 6'1"" actor, Robbie Coltrane look 8'6"".<br/><br/>My favorite scenes may not be what you think they should be. I like the big scenes, but my favorite scenes are not the big scenes.<br/><br/>The first scene I liked was when Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and the Dursleys go to the zoo. Harry's cousin, Dudley (Harry Melling), is celebrating his birthday. Harry, Dudley, Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) are in the reptile house at the zoo. They are looking at a Burmese Python and Dudley wants it to move. Uncle Vernon knocks on the glass to try to get it to move, Harry yells that its asleep. After the others leave, Harry begins talking to the snake... and it understands him. Dudley turns around and sees that the snake is moving. He runs over and pushes Harry out of the way. In anger, Harry makes the glass disappear and Dudley falls in. The python escapes, but Dudley is stuck inside the python's exhibit. Serves him right!<br/><br/>The next scene I liked was the scene of the first Quiddich Match Harry was ever in. I won't describe the scene in detail, but I will tell you that it is amazing to watch. The best part is when Harry catches the Golden Snitch to win the match. He does so by catching it in his mouth.<br/><br/>The third scene I like is chess game Harry, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) play in order to stop Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) from getting the Sorcerer's Stone. It's a giant chess game in which the three young wizards have to play as pieces. There is a scene earlier in the movie when we see Harry and Ron playing Wizard Chess and this is exactly like that only bigger.<br/><br/>Of course I am going to give Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 10 stars out of 10. I liked everything about this movie."

","Looking back, a lot has changed since 2001. One of the things I think of when I notice how much has changed is the evolution of the series of Harry Potter. In 2001, the first Harry Potter film was released, and it became an instant classic for the next decade.<br/><br/>With a young Daniel Radcliffe starring as Harry Potter, the boy who lives with his aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and his uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) until he finds out he's a wizard. Harry Potter is said to be the main character, but unfortunately Daniel is figuratively and literally overshadowed with the appearance of Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the Keeper of the Keys of the magical school, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And the news keeps on coming.<br/><br/>Later, we are introduced to the actors who will lead a generation. Alan Rickman plays the Potions teacher, Professor Snape, with a masterful display. Maggie Smith plays Professor McGonagall, and the late Richard Harris portrays Albus Dumbledore, the wise old Headmaster, who leads Harry in his quest for the Philosopher's Stone. But things become a lot more serious eventually...<br/><br/>All in all, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a great film. In theory, it should receive 9 out of 10, but somehow I feel it lacks the spark needed to make the film truly wonderful."

"KaDaWe","10","0","1","17 August 2013"," Call Me Crazy, But In My Opinion The Best Potter
","Wow, what a movie! I watched this film several times in the last years and can't get enough of it. For me personally this is best book and the best movie of Joanne K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"".<br/><br/>The reason why I like it so much is that Harry just doesn't know anything about the magical word, he doesn't even know that it exists. Then he finds it out and with that explores the whole new world, like Diagon Alley, Hogwarts Castle of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and also these little things like Quidditch and words like ""Muggle"". To be part of this journey that Harry experiences is just a wonderful feeling. Of course this is also the case in the later stories, for example the Ministry of Magic and that there are also other wizard schools, but not that often and in this particular way.<br/><br/>So, that's the reason why I also love the book, but the big thing why I think that ""The Philosopher's Stone"" and ""The Chamber of Secrets"" are perhaps the best Potter's is because Chris Columbus, the director, made an amazing job of creating this world in reality. He put all important moments of the books in and didn't come up with other scenes which didn't even happen - like the last director David Yates sadly did. Columbus was really able to convert the magical world around Harry from a novel to the screen.<br/><br/>Overall this is one of my favorite movies of all time, maybe even the best. The story is fantastic, the acting is great and everything is perfectly taken over from book to film. Just amazing, 10 stars out of 10 from my perspective!"

I do like the Dumbledore actor in this movie more then the others in the series. Coltrane is awesome as Hagrid and the movie is uplifting and keeps you riveted to the screen for two and a half hours.

","""The New Wizard of Oz' of its time. A complete triumph"" -Richard Roeper <br/><br/>I have to admit I'm not a fan of Harry Potter films. I haven't read any of the books either and I tend to avoid films that cause a huge fan phenomenon. My friend was telling me I have been too critical towards Harry Potter and I should give it a new try and watch it again. So that's what I did. <br/><br/>I find the atmosphere in the movie from the very beginning to the end is the best thing in entire movie. Some scenes indeed contain the same kind of magical feeling and same kind visual details as Victor Fleming's Wizard of Oz. Also the music fits into the movie very well. <br/><br/>The first 1/3 of the movie, where Harry Potter prepares his journey to Hogwarts, is very amusing to watch. The very detailed world and its unique, interesting characters owes very much to Wizard of Oz without a doubt. The amount of small details, like moving paintings and newspaper pictures are a joy for an eye.<br/><br/>But then there are the downsides of the movie. The runtime of 152 minutes is just way too long. On the half way the movie made me to yawn and hope for something to happen. Also second downside is the way how all students and teachers, excluding the main characters of course, in the school feel totally unimportant. They are less alive than the moving paintings on the walls. The final and the biggest downside of the film is it's plot full of holes. It seems that teachers in the school got no interest to find out anything what what going on the school. When the killer troll breaks into the school, teachers are unable to do anything about it. Afterwards life continues like nothing ever happened. Nobody cares to wonder where did the troll come from. The same happens with unicorn scene too. It seems the teachers in ""the most secured school in the world"" wish that someone would get hurt. <br/><br/>I guess things are more explained in the book and the book covers up the main plot holes that remain in the movie but it is still not an excuse to forgive them.<br/><br/>Overall I find the creation of the magical world and the atmosphere are the greatest things that save the movie. I can understand the phenomenon this movie has caused in the world and I can understand calling this film as new Wizard of Oz although I do not agree with that by myself. <br/><br/>Although this movie is not something that would touch me into the heart, it was still a pleasant movie to watch and I managed to the ending credits with a happy, good feeling."

"moistplinth12","6","0","1","31 May 2013"," Great at the time and still has something special about it.
","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is probably my favourite film from the franchise, though this is largely for nostalgic reasons, it definitely has strengths. Richard Harris' Dumbledore is calm and wise, as he should be, we trust and revere him implicitly, Snape (Rickman) has the appropriate level of menacing sweep, his opening scene is arguably the highlight of the entire series as he informs us, quivering in our over-sized robes in our first week, that we can learn how to put a stopped in death, and Emma Watson is delightfully bossy as Hermione. She is, of the main three, the one who shines throughout all, with arguably the hardest part, she brings emotion, intelligence and a hefty helping of guts to a well-loved character. The film is not big and brash, unlike some its successors, it is simple and relies on the quality of the story being told and the actors doing that. It makes little or no go at impressing the audience, and in doing so, embodies a childlike inquisitiveness and charms its audience into caring about mirrors and stones and 'silly incantations.' That is its pivotal achievement; that it can take the viewer back to a moment before they knew what a tax return was, or that Voldermort would rise again. Right from the moment Richard Griffiths practically sneers 'No post on Sundays,' you know the film will make an admirable attempt at recreating the magic of the books, but try as it might, it eventually falls short of the standard required to do justice to a novel, which whilst it may not be expertly crafted, had enough about it to capture the hearts of a generation. At eleven Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was one of the most awe inspiring things I'd seen, but several years on, it leaves something to be desired."

","I've never been the kind of person that buys into hype and to be honest, I hate most big budget films, So until this weekend, I've avoided everything Harry Potter. That being said, I have never met anyone who had anything bad to say about the Potter films, so I finally decided to give it a shot, and boy was I surprised! For those select few who don't know the story, Harry Potter is the son of two legendary wizards, who was hidden with distant relatives, in order to protect him. Until his eleventh birthday, he had no idea that he was famous or had the potential to be the most power wizard the world has ever known. Potter is invited to join the Hogwarts school of wizardry and that is when the adventure begins. British Actor, Daniel Radcliffe, plays Potter and is nothing short of spectacular. Before the Potter films, Radcliffe had very limited acting experience and many say, he got the part, because of his resemblance to Harry Potter on the cover of the book. That may be how he got the part, but he defiantly shows he has the talent to go along with the right look. His performance was terrific, but there is something to be said about having the right Director, and Christopher Columbus was the perfect choice. Columbus has a ton of experience working with young newcomers in films with high expectations. Overall, the story is extremely well written, the young cast was refreshing and full of energy, the direction was stellar, and the set, costumes, and effects were some of the best I've ever seen. I'm not going to go run out and join a quitage team, but I am going to see the rest of the series. Harry Potter is a huge budget franchise, but for once, a blockbuster film does live up to the hype, and earns the title of a must see movie!"

","Harry Potter and the philosopher's/sorcerer's Stone is the first of 8 movies, and in my opinion it is the authentic one and properly also the best though the story in places differ from what is in the book it still captures all the aspects of the story in just the right way, or at least in a way that I at the time great Harry Potter fan could accept. I have more than one friend who didn't read the book but instead saw the film, and often that is the way to do it because the movie will never live up to the expectation you have from the book. Harry Potter and the philosopher's/sorcerer's Stone is not one of these movies if someone came up to me and asked should I read the book before seeing the movie so I don't miss things, or should I see the movie and afterwords read the book, or can I just see the film and understand everything that happens. I would tell them that for this book/movie you can do what you want the film is so good that you will miss almost nothing from the book and will be totally ready for the next film/book (although a few characters like Ginny Weasley didn't get a prober introduction in the first movie). I think overall the cast was great and really capture the people. I in particular loved Dumbledore that was the spitting image of Dumbledore as I saw him with a perfect mix of calm and commanding demeanor. There are a few things fans of the harry potter book might have wished they had put in there, but all in all this is a great introduction to the Harry Potter universe. It is not a perfect move and I will there for not give it ten but it is close to perfect representation of the source material and for that I give it a 9/10."

","I really enjoy both of Christopher Columbus' films in the Harry Potter series (he also directed ""The Chamber of Secrets""). The first two films of the Harry Potter series are definitely the two that manage to catch every aspect of the magic that was involved in the Harry Potter series. This is an amazing start to a great series of films.<br/><br/>To begin with, the cast is delightful. The very young children playing the roles of the students are fantastic, just as you would expect them to be. The child actor's in this series are definitely some of the best of this era. It truly is the cast of British actors in the adult roles that create a new world of wonder and magic. Richard Harris captures every single moment of Albus Dumbledore's charm and wisdom. Maggie Smith was amazing in her role of Minerva McGonagall, showing audiences the firm, yet caring teacher. Alan Rickman is absolutely amazing in his role of the greasy, cold-hearted Potions teacher Severus Snape. Robbie Coltrane has some great moments as the half-giant Hagrid.<br/><br/>If you've read the books, Hogwarts will come to life just as you always had imagined it. Hogwarts is done beautifully, accompanied by a score by John Williams. The magical world is created very quickly before your eyes.<br/><br/>This is truly an amazing film that captures every detail of the magic that J.K.

","McKenna Hines Mr. Anderson English 2A 11/1/12<br/><br/>Expelliarmus!<br/><br/>Looking for a good movie? Or maybe 8? The Harry Potter books have all been made into thrilling movies! Each book has been made into one movie, except the seventh which has been filmed as two. The magical Harry Potter film series are wonderful movies, because of their cast, costumes, sets, and soundtracks, anyone who hasn't seen these movies should.<br/><br/>The first reason everyone should see these movies is, the cast is simply amazing. The cast is a fantastic group of talented actors, who over the course of the ten year filming process have developed even more skills. The acting crew wasn't just picked out of a catalog, for example, ""Author J.K. Rowling insisted that the principal cast be British and she got her wish."" (Cast) It's important for the actors to be a British majority because it gives the movies a closer image and experience of what the books are like. If this beloved author had a requirement for the making of the films, the product is bound to be great! The Harry Potter cast is an extremely talented group of actors, which causes that everyone should see these wonderful movies! <br/><br/>The second reason everyone should see these movies, is the costumes throughout the series add an authentic touch to each movie. The filmmakers successfully incorporated a sense of commonality between the characters and viewers of the movies. In an article titled ""Harry Potter and the Costume Designer,"" Lucy Snowe wrote, ""...it is easy to see why the producers chose an angle that encourages young audiences to see more of themselves in the three heroes of the films."" For example, Hermione is often cast in just a plain sweater, a very common wardrobe piece. Hermione is just one of the examples of a character's costume relating to viewers. The sense of mutuality created by the costumes is yet another reason the series should be seen by everyone. <br/><br/>The third reason these movies should be seen by anyone who hasn't already is the sets in this movie series create a scene deserving love. Filmmakers were able to turn usual, normal sites into enchanted houses, stores, classrooms, and much more. Gene Openshaw wrote in an article titled, ""Harry Potter Film Sites and Locations by Rick Steves,"" ""Harry's story is set in a magical Britain, and all of the places mentioned in the books, except London, are fictional, but you can visit many real film locations. Many of the locations are closed to visitors, though, or are an nonmagical disappointment in person, unless you're a huge fan"" (Openshaw). When visited later, the filmed locations aren't nearly as exciting; the filmmakers were able to create magical scenes in everyday places. The sets in this magical film series add onto the reasons that everyone should see these films.<br/><br/>Finally, movie watchers should see the films because of their amazing soundtracks. ""Hedwig's Theme Song"" is the theme song used in all the movies. A song analyzer wrote, ""Obviously, this piece has a great deal of chromatic movement for it to remain tonal"" (Hedwig's). This song is just one of the many instrumental pieces composed for the Harry Potter series. The soundtracks in these movies create a sense of imagination that any person should see! <br/><br/>In conclusion, the Harry Potter movie series are great movies that should be seen by anyone that hasn't seen them. First, the cast is a group of very talented actors joined together to make great movies. Second, the costumes should be loved because they relate to the way viewers dress and create a sense of closeness to the actors. Third, the sets turn day to day places into lovable, magical places.

","From the moment J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books were formed into movies for viewing on the big screen, we knew they would be a success across the globe - and so it proved.<br/><br/>Christopher Columbus was the first of numerous directors to take the director's seat and cohesively bring together a film to do justice to Rowling's original novel. <br/><br/>Back in the beginning, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) was destined to become the chosen one, the one to bring balance to magic. Living with his cruel and deceitful Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), Harry jumps at the chance of leaving home to attend a school of magic with friendly messenger Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). While swiftly making friends in the form of Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), he soon realises that villainous beings may be at work in the halls of Hogwarts - the school of magic. <br/><br/>It's all rather exciting - even more so at the time of its release as it was the first 'Harry Potter' movie to be released. <br/><br/>Certainly, not the best of the collection in my eyes anyway. The trio of Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are still finding their feet and maximum acting ability - the chemistry is still developing. Also, it feels more of an introductory movie more than anything else but when watching it over again, it brings back the sense of enjoyment and happiness of viewing its evolution once more. <br/><br/>Concluding, I offer seven points to Gryffindor!"

"reginald-anselm","9","0","2","30 August 2012"," A great adaptation
","One of the most wonderful Harry Potter movies, it is excellent. Of course things have been cut out for time but the most important elements are here(unlike later movies). The cast was excellent, I was thrilled by Argus Filch who was kinda scary(unlike later movies) and his cat, Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore was also very book-like and nice to look and listen at. The movie has only one big flaw and that it's too close to the book. Columbus followed the book almost to the letter and didn't let his own imagination to spice the story up. The sets looked gorgeous. I am sad that some of the rooms in the end were cut. Hagrid had mentioned earlier that Snape had been one of the people who designed the protection of the stone yet his potion riddle was cut along with Quirrell's troll."
"parallel_projection","8","0","3","15 August 2012"," Great job at adapting a great book
","This movie is simply magical, and I think that, along with introducing you to the wizarding world, is the entire point. Their are so many details that enrich the story, which can be found in the costumes, props, and the magnificent sets. Also, Chris Columbus does a fine job at directing--several sequences were really well done, and you can tell he's good at working with the younger actors.<br/><br/>Almost everybody by now knows Harry Potter's story, and although this does waver from the book a little bit, it covers all the important things, and does a fantastic job at introducing us to all the characters, who are brilliantly acted. Everybody from Maggie Smith to Robbie Coltrane to David Bradley does a fine job, and on top of that, the casting was superb, especially with the choice of Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>Of the three younger actors, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, oddly enough, stand out above Daniel Radcliffe, with Emma doing just slightly a better job than Rupert. She gives such an attitude to Hermione that I think was really important to carry over from the book, and Rupert has great comic timing that really shines. Daniel, however, is just alright. At times he's wonderful, but other times he's a bit stiff and robotic in how he speaks, which is understandable considering his age at the time.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic start of what turned into a fantastic franchise. If for some reason you haven't gotten into Harry Potter, hurry up! You won't be disappointed."

","Well, this first installment brings us to the get go of Potter's life. I thought they would make a too big introduction until we get to the action, but fortunately the writers knew how to make a reasonable time for introduction-- and were able to not make it a boring moment of the film. Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert show in the very first version of the franchise how talented they are, and I'm pretty sure production team already knew they would never disappoint-- and in fact, they never did. ""Sorcerer's Stone"" the whole time tries to make you believe Snape is the bad guy, giving clues he's the one trying to steal the stone-- when in fact, it's another random professor. Special effects are decent for such year it's been released, but for the high budget they had I thought it could be a little more realistic at times. Rest of the cast is good and I don't have one name to flame all around. From now on I'll be seeing the next episodes, and I hope it continues this good!"
"salesgab","8","0","1","23 May 2012"," Great Adaptation
","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (or the Sorcerer's Stone, if you like) Is a very interesting and well crafted film, based on a best selling book by J. K. Rowling. Although the main cast is basically made of children, acting was good enough, none of them soiling the film. The supporting cast, on the other hand, has some of the most talented actors in Britain (Richard Harris is a great example). It is also worth mention the small role played by John Cleese (ex Monty Python.) Chris Columbus's direction was excellent, and the special effects and art direction were an example to be followed. To add to all that, we have yet another magnificent score by John Williams. The screenplay was very well written, being closer to the book than any other film of the series. All in all, the fans of the book series will always find this film both entertaining and familiar. With very few and understandable differences, it is a very nice adaptation for the screen of J. K. Rowling's best seller."
"classicsoncall","8","0","2","1 April 2012"," ""There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.""
","With Professor McGonagall's (Maggie Smith) description of young Harry Potter, I wonder if J.K. Rowling ever realized the world wide phenomenon she would be creating with the series of novels that began with 'The Sorceror's Stone', and the subsequent movie franchise that would make her Britain's wealthiest citizen. Well, it's history now, and for future generations, the saga of Harry Potter will be relived again and again to the wonderment of new fans and followers.<br/><br/>For myself, this introduction to the Harry Potter universe was an entertaining one. I'm not a kid and have no interest in reading the books myself, but I find it encouraging that youngsters will spend time reading the novels instead of frittering their hours away on less productive pursuits. I've heard the criticisms about the witchcraft and wizardry that are part of the Potter lore, but these are the kinds of subjects that fascinate the imagination the way all good entertainment does in whatever form. So I say keep reading and enjoying.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, I like movies that have a bit of the magical and whimsical in them, along with clever writing and understated humor. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his young friends take us on an exciting journey through the venerable halls of the Hogwarts School, and introduce us to a colorful cast of characters, some who may not be what they seem at first glance. For my part, I'm now well versed in the concept that the wand chooses the wizard, and that evil wizards must drink unicorn blood to keep up their strength. I'm still not clear why the knowledge of Harry's reputation would have preceded him with his contemporaries, but I guess I'll find that out in due time. With the film franchise now complete, I can pace myself at my own leisure without having to wait a year between installments to watch the Harry Potter saga unfold."
"trixie-k-88","8","0","1","30 March 2012"," The magic begins
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fun and whimsical introduction to the Harry Potter series. While some consider this a weaker part of the series, it truly started the success of the whole franchise.<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a neglected ten year old boy who lives with his cruel aunt, uncle and cousin the Dursleys. He is shocked when a gigantic man named Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) appears on his 11th birthday to tell Harry that he is a wizard, and he has come to take him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As Hagrid takes him to shop for school supplies Harry learns that not only is he a wizard, but the most famous young wizard in the world; his parents were not killed in a car crash, but murdered by an evil wizard named Voldemort. Voldemort tried to murder Harry as an infant, but failed and disappeared, leaving only a lightning shaped scar on Harry's forehead. On the train to school Harry befriends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), a goofy young red head, and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), a clever know-it-all born from ""muggle"" (non-magical) parents. When he arrives at school Harry makes enemies just as soon as he made friends, out of an arrogant bully Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and the potions teacher Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). Through their first school year Harry, Ron and Hermione learn the basic lessons of a magical education, battle a troll, and Harry even joins the Quidditch team, an exciting sport played on broomstick. As Harry learns more about his past and the Wizarding world, he and his friends hear whispers of Voldemort's attempted resurrection. They suspect he is looking for the Sorcerer's Stone, a gem that will grant eternal life. The kids seek help from the wise and powerful headmaster Dumbledore (Richard Harris), but while he is away from the school the action to protect the Sorcerer's Stone falls into the hands of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.<br/><br/>Not only is this a great introduction to Harry Potter, it's a good movie on its own. Admittedly the acting is mediocre, if not a bit poor at some parts with the kids. But considering that both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson had never acted before, and Dan Radcliffe only appeared for a few minutes in other movies, they did a pretty good job. The special effects were decent, and the parts that were not as good were overpowered by the strong magical atmosphere. The set for Hogwarts and Diagon Alley were absolutely AMAZING! They were just how I pictured, and from what I'd heard, just as J.K. Rowling pictured as well. The wardrobe was also done very well. The school uniforms, hats, and outfits of the teachers were fantastic. As for the plot, Columbus definitely tread lightly. This film is probably the closest to the book of any Harry Potter film. Despite some of the lesser acting, I find the atmosphere and storyline of this film to be one of the stronger ones in the series. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fun and exciting fantasy that starts fans up for an adventure that will last for years."

","A good movie if you like the book, but as a movie by itself... not a masterpiece. I adore the books and it's hard for me to switch out of ""adore mode"". The story does not follow the book exactly. I first saw it as a small kid and I was really impressed, and even though I have now seen better movies, my first ""wow"" still lingers.<br/><br/>Please do not watch it if you haven't read the book! The book is way better and the movie will spoil it for you! It is important to get your own image of what everyone looks like, their characters, etc. The book is also a little funnier (this is increasingly true with later movies in the series). There are plenty of beautiful scenes, but I would not say that the quality of the movie is that great. Later on, the actors are less cute, but the acting is better, so the quality of the series improves. It's a good family movie to watch with your kids (or parents)."

","It's the best movie of the best book. <br/><br/>It has everything: a original story, an incredible cast, a talented production. It's a really breath of air, compared to today blockbuster where CGI is indigent and to later Potter movies (the Yates period) where everything turns darks. <br/><br/>Watching those first steps makes me understand two things: <br/><br/>First, when a movie involves kid, their credibility lies upon the creativity of the director. Indeed, Columbus was the finest choice for the job after what he has done in ""Home alone"". Here, he gives his young cast the perfect suggestions. I believed a lot of people find the movie too much eye-candy but it's what the book is about: stepping into a new universe filled with magical things and with kids. So, the crucial thing was to have this feeling of amazement.<br/><br/>Next, Potter is the best piece of fantasy since ""Star Wars"". I really don't see others fiction works that can make dream kids and adult as well in the 1990 and 2000. The only regret we can get is that the first stories are really educational for kids whereas the last stories, starting with HPATOFP, are too much about violence, death, war and killings. I really can't accept the high dose of violence the young generation is exposed today because life is above all about fighting inner demons than bad people! How can they discover what courage means when the only solution they see is to punch, kick, kill the one who are against them. our actual societies are becoming like Sparta and thus, in those earlier movies of Potter and in this one, particularly, there was at least still place for innocence."

However, I do think they should have included Peeves, a character in the modern classic by J.K. Rowling. They also made it kind of too fun. I personally think that they could have made it a tiny bit darker and a little more violent. Overprotective parents, do not fear, this movie is rated PG and is not super evil and destructive. I recommend that kids nine years old and up watch this. They had good acting, and should be rated four or five stars by fans.

Anyways, the things I enjoyed the most in this movie was how despite how bookish it looked I could still feel the feelings that the characters or actors were feelings. Another thing was,as all kids do, was the dialogue. I will always have the phrases ""pertificus totalus"", "" Now if I could remember what I have forgotten"", and ""how can you be nearly headless"" engraved in my own mind forever. I also enjoyed parts like with Professor Quirrell and meeting Harry or the ending with Voldemort. There was a huge intensity that could not be denied. I also loved Sorting Hat and Norbert, the baby dragon. The Sorting Hat was awesome with the deep and knowledgeable voice. And I have always had a deep tenderness for any reptile.

"Meven_Stoffat","7","0","1","21 August 2011"," Philosopher's flick is a respectable start, but feels half baked compared with the rest of the lot (blu-ray review)
","Since the novel's 1997 release, the buzz about a film adaptation of Philosopher's Stone was abounds. It wasn't until 2001 when Potterheads' dreams came true, and the book's film adaptation came out, sending fans to the cinemas in droves. Since the film's release and foretold box office success, the series has gone on to have the whole book series adapted, including the most successful adaptation, the newest one, Deathly Hallows Part 2. Since all the movies are out, I figured it would be nice to let my inner Potterhead put the nostalgia to the test. <br/><br/>Let me start off by that Harry Potter has played a big part in my life. I've been a fan since 1999, when my aunt sent me the first book for Christmas. I had no idea what Harry Potter was at the time, and furthermore, the book was my first big read, so as you could imagine, opening the pages and reading the first few sentences, I was immediately hooked. Every time a book came out, I was frantic to get it. I saw every movie on their respective opening day, and own every movie on DVD, and recently rebought them on blu-ray. <br/><br/>As of a recent rewatching, this movie, I will say, is a solid adaptation that, at the time, was considered the ""Watchmen"" of fantasy novels, in the fact that it was unfilmable. For the most part, Columbus did a solid job with the source material. However, if one thing holds the movie back, it seems as if he was trying too hard to make it perfect. I think anyone who hasn't read the book will be lost on what's happening, as a result. Dint get me wrong, this movie is indeed very good in terms of being a solid adaptation. I think, however, Columbus could have done a better job at making it a bit more cinematic.<br/><br/>The acting, for a mostly kid anchored cast, is excellent. Daniel Radcliffe was a little kid back when this was going on, nobody thought he'd go on to be the little actor who stole audiences hearts worldwide. He really did a fantastic job with the role. He essentially leaped from the pages of the book, he's that good. The supporting cast do as good a job as said Radcliffe. Rupert Grint was probably the cutest member of the cast! He was just charming and quirky as the dimwitted but ever so funny Ron. Emma Watson was extremely cute as Hermione, and man, her performance is almost like she really is Hermione in real life! Let's not forget to mention Tom Felton who apparently didn't read the book, yet excelled as Draco, and Matthew Lewis as the naive but charming Neville Lonottom. Speaking of which, it's worth it to mention how he's grown up so much. I'm not gay, but seriously, LOOK AT MATTHEW LEWIS NOW. He is GORGEOUS. Honestly, I'm not gay at all, but it's so hard to believe he went from being a pudgy kid to an extremely handsome grown adult. In fact, the entire cast have grown up so much, it's unbelievable. <br/><br/>In addition, the cinematography in the film is brilliant. From the films gorgeous opening shots of Privet Drive to the vibrant colour of Hogwarts, this is one of the most visually gorgeous shots ever.<br/><br/>While watching the blu-ray, one word rang through the back of my head, ""soft"". The image quality is simply not what it could have been. Mind you, this was shot on a considerably lower budget than the rest of the lot. And this is the best looking the movie will be. Some shots looked fantastic, others looked like Sharon Osbourne did the transfer. Also, either it's just me or there was a major adjust in F-stop in the Quidditch scene. The Audio is a nice mix, though, as there is a lot of oomph in John Williams' score, as well as the sound effects simply sound more epic. The special features, though, are exactly the same as the DVD. You'd think they'd have brought some more features in for the blu-ray, but come on.<br/><br/>In short, apparently at the time, in 2007 WB didn't screen this blu ray for blu ray review sites. It's not hard to see why. As for the movie, it's a good start, but there was a lot more to come. Still, a must see nonetheless."

","To put it simply, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great way to start a francise, a way to find out what works and what doesn't. It's very similar to what Confused Matthew said about the first Spider Man and the Star Trek Reboot, a film to find out how to make the rest of the series will work. The film overrall is great, but since it's the first film, there are a few problems, like the child actors. I mean, compared to most child actors, their frekin amazing, but let's be happy that they got better as the series went on. Plus some of the special effects didn't age well, such as the troll scene. The troll itself still looks pretty cool, but sometimes it so obviously a CGI Harry.<br/><br/>However, as an adabtation, it's one of the best I've ever seen, although I have always wanted to see Peeves in live action. And overall, the production design is absolutely amazing, Warner Brothers were obviously confident that this film would be successful and lead to a franchise to put so much money into it. And quite literally, every actor fits their roles, such as Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, and Robbie Cultrane.<br/><br/>In conclusion, compared to the other films, it feels a little dated, but I still think it's a great film."

There are some who argue that by following the book so closely the film becomes a bit stale, but I couldn't think of a better way to start the series. By being so faithful to the book, we're able to learn more about the characters and the magical world around them. There are certain parts that could've been fixed but they aren't major and they don't take away from the overall enjoyability of the movie.

Harry has absolutely no relief in his life. But on his 11th birthday, Harry learns a secret. He is actually a wizard. Harry is suddenly thrust into a world full of magic and is invited to attend the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. In school, Harry makes new friends and learns many new things.

Hagrid did the tapping thing on the bricks and 2.) the chess scene- where Ron sacrificed himself. (/SPOILERS)<br/><br/>Re-watching this movie made me really feel nostalgic. Sure, the last time I watched this movie was just last year, in preparation for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"".

He had no idea of what had happened to his parents. The Dursleys had always told him they had died in a car crash. Yes, it was a miserable life of Harry; until he had received a letter that will be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He also found that he is wizard, and that his mom and dad were killed by Voldemort, an evil wizard so evil that every witch and wizard is afraid to speak his name. But Voldemort had failed to kill little Harry, so he had left a lightning-shaped scar on his forehand. Thus Harry became ""The Boy Who Lived."" So Harry is taken to Hogwarts, and there he meets the half-giant Rubeus Hagrid; fellow classmates Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. I know I would say this, but that is all I will tell you about the film, folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends. As I said many times, I don't have any particular scene I like, because I love ""The Philosopher's Stone"" from beginning to end. You know, I would have to agree with Minerva McGonagall: is it wise to leave Harry with those...people?!"

","When Harry Potter first came out, I was not allowed to watch it. For one thing, I was 12 or so and had problems reading books with scary scenes. So my parents thought it best that I not watch it.<br/><br/>Well, years later I'm now 18 and have watched this for the first time. And I must say, from my perspective now, not much ""scared"" me. In fact, more things were humorous and interesting. I liked the plot, which was based off a book. I loved the characters and their personalities. I was very impressed with the special effects from the CGI to the real life effects.<br/><br/>The only thing I found meh was the fact that it's dealing with imaginary things which we cannot compare to in real life. Lame excuse, however I still wasn't sure if I liked the idea of just casual 'magic' being used. I am more of a logical realistic guy than anything.<br/><br/>At any rate, this wasn't a bad movie at all. Looking forward to 'catching up' to the one coming soon!"

","Gone With the Wind was another literary phenomenon that produced a film rendering that had to meet equally exacting fan qualifications. It's comparable in the sense that everyone had an attitude about the casting, which in due course resulted wonderfully. The novelists required a loyalty to the manuscript, which was respected. Directors were enlisted who could be relied upon to deferentially work for the material. Immeasurable arithmetic was done while constructing the corporal worlds of the novels. Producers challenged standard constraints about running time to incorporate all the indispensable narrative episodes.<br/><br/>On a hushed suburban London street, owls emerge, a cat transforms into Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltraine relinquishes a bundled infant to a doorstep. Harry Potter, an urchin who keeps extraordinarily buoyant despite the never-ending bitterness and cruelty allotted by the intolerant aunt and uncle with whom he's been left, is kept in a cubbyhole, tormented by his browbeating cousin, forbidden from opening the officially addressed envelopes that inexplicably begin arriving for him. The relatives are stunned when the same leviathan, Hagrid, arrives on Harry's 11th birthday to notify him that he's indeed the son of two slain wizards and is now welcome to grace Hogwarts. Very smartly, this is all done with tongue lodged in cheek and rewarded by temporary comeuppance.<br/><br/>The reason this near-ideal product holds up so well from age ten to twenty owes to its humor, its light-hearted youthful nature, though it's clear that Chris Columbus cuts and arranges his camera very capriciously and isn't the ideal filmmaker for staging action dramatically or developing with deliberate accent, depending instead on FX and John Williams' tiringly hectic score to punch up crucial moments. Nevertheless, it's all on the right tonal level, as we're absconded into a world immortalized to an unusually engaging extent by production design, locations, effects and actors. The key, naturally, is Radcliffe. Young Daniel's standard facial appearance, unkempt dark hair, sheer eyes, round spectacles make an instantaneously adorable Harry. He's an average underdog whose continuing comprehension of his uncommon power I believe.<br/><br/>When, at 40 minutes in, the school is finally seen, kids paddling across a lake at night toward its soaring spires on a bastion-style outcrop, the film establishes a sought-after atmosphere of marvel and mystery about what lies ahead. Maggie Smith recurs as Professor McGonagall, who heads the much-repeated ""sorting"" of students arbitrated in the immense Great Hall by a pleasant talking hat. Harry, Weasley and Hermione wind up together in Gryffindor, while their little arch-rival Malfoy is allocated to Slytherin, where Alan Rickman's ham-handedly fearsome Professor Snape rules. Mysteriously, a feast materializes on the endless tables, ghosts gracefully flutter around, paintings are flesh, stairways reposition unexpectedly.<br/><br/>Throughout a decidedly action-packed school year, it appears someone wicked is scheming to purloin the eponymous Stone for Voldemort, a matchless wizard who's been without power since he slaughtered Harry's parents but couldn't quite dispose of the child. The stone lies beyond a trap door fortified by a massive three-headed dog absurdly named Fluffy. In a jam-packed chain of events from such highlights as Harry's night-time rovings in his invisibility cloak and seeing his late parents in a conjuring mirror to eluding Fluffy into a full-scale chessboard, the young threesome has its nerve and cleverness weathered to the utmost in a clash of obvious good versus evil, though the chess match alas underscores violence over suspense.<br/><br/>Harry's found to be so skillful at piloting a broomstick that he's made star player on Gryffindor's team in Quidditch, a staggeringly unsafe sport that has its pre-pubescent players hundreds of feet above an arena on brooms in frantic pursuit of very hard high-speed balls. The airborne element is excellently achieved visually, but the Quidditch match itself is one sequence that indulges speed with suspense and loudness with excitement without the support of narrative motion.<br/><br/>Regardless, the cast recompenses flat out, especially the sweetly extroverted Emma Watson as the prying, sharp-witted Hermione, and Rupert Grint, whose Weasley grows charmingly from a perfectly nebbishy second-banana comic foil into indispensable sidekick. On the grown-up front, Coltrane is foremost among contemporaries, yet it's no revelation how superlatively such authorities as Smith, Rickman, John Hurt, Richard Harris as the white-maned Dumbledore, Ian Hart as the enigmatic Quirrell and Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw as the nervously conventional Dursleys are brilliant.<br/><br/>By and large, the vast effects are exceptional and pleasing. Some of the creature work, like the centaur, even calls to mind Harryhausen's pioneering stop-motion. The costumes are another spring for repeated amusement, while John Seale's widescreen lensing substantially proliferates everything across the screen. If all movies acquisitively allocated as cinematic franchises could be as spotlessly considered as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, there'd be no incentive to lament cinema's asinine commodification."

","Rescued from the outrageous neglect of his aunt and uncle, a young boy with a great destiny proves his worth while attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br/><br/>This is the film that started it all, and was, of course, a huge success. One might wonder what would happen if you had seven movies to make and the first one already flopped or was poorly done. But this did not happen. The crew was perfect, with a master of family films (Chris Columbus) at the helm. The casting could have been tricky, since they had to get children to act well on screen and then make sure they could keep them for a decade. Daniel Radcliffe proved to be perfect for the part, and Emma Watson does alright, too, despite overacting at times.<br/><br/>The adult cast is fleshed out with plenty of solid choices, filling the void from serious, to silly to scary. Alan Rickman, who plays Snape, has a little bit of all three, and was really a crucial casting choice, and the costume department did their best to make him look like Trent Reznor. Perhaps they could have cast Reznor himself, but I suspect he does not have Rickman's range.<br/><br/>Of all the films in the series, this is the lightest. There is a villain, but he plays a minor role. And there are some dangerous challenges, but overall the element of fun remains. These are 11-year old children, so there needs be no rush to push them into a world of life and death. And for those who have not read the books, this is our first time meeting everyone, so introductions and character development are important."

","This is still my personal Potter favorite. The Sorcerer's Stone is still the film that opened my eyes to the world of young wizards and witchcraft. Its sequels are worth recommending, but it becomes increasingly less magical and wondrous. No matter how great a film is, it's rare for the film to capture fully the essence of the book. Harry Potter is no exception. This is the work and imagination of the filmmakers themselves, not necessarily what we believe it should be. Another director could have seen the world of Harry Potter in a different light.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus (Home Alone) fortunately sees Harry Potter's world in a way that satisfies the majority of die-hard Potter fans. There's enough movie magic to enthrall and engage even non-Potter fans (which includes me). The Sorcerer's Stone delivers in most areas, giving us a detailed glimpse of the fantasy world unlike any other fantasy movies. The action sequences are exciting but not a standout on its own. The young leading cast of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson give exceptional performances that pull the strings of the film together, without being too brash or childish.<br/><br/>The Oscar nominated score by John Williams highlights his amazing musical ability time and time again, giving a grandeur, mystifying sound to the production. The only major problem the Harry Potter movie series faced was the competition and the higher standards set by the Lord Of The Rings (LOTR) screen trilogy which was launched at nearly the same time. Somehow, The Sorcerer's Stone feels amateurish compared to the Fellowship of The Ring. It's also probably the reason Harry Potter will always play second fiddle to LOTR. But on its own, The Sorcerer's Stone is a highly imaginative film narrative that is compelling and a pleasure to watch. Wingardium leviosa!

","J. K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" novels have caught the imagination of the public like no other children's literature of recent years, not even Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"". Rowling's stroke of genius was to combine two areas of children's fiction which are normally kept separate, the world of magic and witchcraft and the world of the boarding school. (The ""school story"", dating back at least to ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"" from the early Victorian period, has long been a prolific source of children's literature in Britain, if less so in other countries). <br/><br/>The basic concept behind the stories is that, alongside the familiar everyday world, there exists a shadowy Wizarding World, all but invisible to ""muggles"" (those lacking in magical powers). The inhabitants of this world appear to be normal human beings, but possess magical abilities. Rowling's hero Harry Potter is an orphaned boy who lives in an ordinary suburban home with his unpleasant relatives, the Dursleys. Unknown to the Dursleys, Harry is secretly a wizard who has inherited magical powers from his late parents, and on his eleventh birthday he is offered a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a large Gothic building in the Scottish Highlands where all British witches and wizards are educated. <br/><br/>This was the first in the series of Harry Potter films. Each of Rowling's books covers the events of a single year in Harry's career at Hogwarts, and the original plan was for a new Potter film to come out every year between 2001 and 2007. This schedule, however, proved too ambitious, possibly because Rowling had not actually finished writing all seven novels in 2001, and the series is not due to be completed until the release of the second part of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" in the summer of next year. <br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" essentially serves as an introduction to the series; much of the first half is taken up with introducing us to Harry, his two close friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and the various teachers, personalities and institutions which he comes across at Hogwarts. Even in the Wizarding World there are villains; indeed, like a number of other fantasy stories, like Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"", the Harry Potter series was conceived as an allegory of good and evil. Like ordinary humans, wizards have the knowledge of good and evil and the moral responsibility to choose between them. A number of wizards have gone over to the ""dark side"", most prominent among them the dreaded Lord Voldemort, who was responsible for the deaths of Harry's parents. The excitement really starts in the second half of the film when Harry and his friends learn of, and try to frustrate, an attempt by Voldemort to obtain the fabled Philosopher's Stone which would give him great power. <br/><br/>One of Rowling's stipulations was that the entire cast should be British or Irish, so this is one of the rare films to be made by a major Hollywood studio (Warner Bros.) without a single American actor. It was, nevertheless, a big success in the United States, thus disproving two major cinematic myths, namely that all successful films need at least one big-name American star and that American audiences need subtitles to understand British English, especially when spoken with a regional accent, as it is here by several of the cast including Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith. In neither case is their accent their normal one; as in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" the Essex-born Smith plays a Scottish schoolmistress, whereas Coltrane, himself from Scotland, plays the school groundsman Rubeus Hagrid with a West Country accent. Nearly all the cast are good, but the most outstanding performances come from Alan Rickman as the melancholy, morally ambiguous teacher Severus Snape and from Richard Harris as the wise, kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore was to be Harris's last great role; he died shortly after finishing the second film in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"". <br/><br/>The first two films, both directed by Chris Columbus, are, despite the perils which Harry and his friends have to face, generally lighter and more cheerful in tone than the later episodes in the franchise. ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" is an excellent introduction to the series, magical not only in its subject-matter but also in the atmosphere of joy and wonder which Columbus is able to conjure up. Particularly memorable sequences include the Quidditch match, the scenes set in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, lit by floating candles, and the life-size game of chess near the end. A magical piece of family entertainment. 8/10"
"neil-476","7","0","1","26 November 2010"," HP1 revisited
","Having just watched HP7A aka Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, my mind flies back - almost magically, one might say - to the film which started it all.<br/><br/>My opinion now is not a lot different to what it was then. The book is a delightful experience - it captured my middle-aged imagination on page 1 and never let go for an instance, telling a cracking story well, and having me believe that Harry and his friends were in real jeopardy throughout. The film's main strength is that it captures much of the book very well.<br/><br/>It has two weaknesses, however. The first is that it is, perhaps, a little too respectful towards its source material. This slavish desire to reflect on screen every tiny detail from the novel causes two problems. One, the film becomes somewhat clinically overstuffed with so much tiny detail that it almost suffocates the life out of it and, two, it sets a standard for detail so impossibly high that future films fall short (the portraits and staircases in Hogwarts no longer move, ghosts no longer charge around etc.).<br/><br/>The second weakness is the three principals. I'm sorry, but I find Daniel Radcliffe pretty wooden throughout the series (subject to some comedy bits in a couple of the later films) and, if he was the best casting choice available, the others couldn't have been very good. Rupert Grint is saddled with a Ron Weasley who does him no favours at all. Not until very late in the series is Ron called upon to be anything than a gormless foil for Harry, a task which Grint accomplishes with ease (and I'm not sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing). And Emma Watson is just awful. So desperate is she to provide a dynamic performance that her mouth takes on an appallingly hypnotic life of its own. I don't ever recall seeing someone talk with such over-emphatic mouth movements. How curious, then, that future films in the series see Watson develop into being one of the very best things Harry Potter offers the viewer."
"studioAT","7","0","1","24 November 2010"," The magic begins
","This first film in the Harry Potter series spends a lot of time setting up the story for the later instalments while still managing to be entertaining in its own right.<br/><br/>The three leads all look very meek, mild and very young but still give good performances alongside their established nearly all British elders. <br/><br/>The plot moves along at a quick pace and the former Home Alone director Collumbus is able to combine the magic and humour from the original novel with all the darkness and visual aids that only cinema could offer. Although the warmth can be a little cloying at times the balance is by and large good.<br/><br/>Overall a solid first instalment to the series and a must for anyone discovering Potter for the first time."
"wolverinesforever","8","0","1","4 October 2010"," A perspective almost nine years after the hype
","""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" marked the first time I ever counted down the days to a film's release. I had read the first four books, loved every single one of them, and I was eagerly anticipating seeing one of my favorite world's come to life on the big screen. I was not disappointed. It remains, to date, one of the best cinema going experiences of my life.<br/><br/>Nine years later, I decided to rewatch it, unsure if, after all these years and subsequent installment, my enjoyment would be diluted. Thankfully, that was not the case. While ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" may not have been the magical experience it was when I first saw it, it was nonetheless entertaining, sometimes inspired, usually engaging, and fast moving.<br/><br/>One of the things that struck me about this film was the production design. Stuart Craig, who remained production designer throughout the series, is masterful in bringing the wonderful world of ""Harry Potter"" to life. From the bustling streets of Diagon Alley, to the autumn-colored, medieval halls of Hogwarts, Craig terrifically brings this alternate world to life.<br/><br/>Most of the adult actors are quite good. Robbie Coltrane gives arguably the best performance as Hagrid, the deeply-caring gamekeeper who treats Harry almost like a surrogate son. Even when he's doing wrong, like hatching dragon eggs, you still root and sympathize for him. Richard Harris is also wonderful as the (mostly) soft-spoken and strong-hearted Albus Dumbledore. It is saddening that he only got to play the role in two movies and we never got the chance to see him evolve his character to the finale. You also have Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths are quite funny in their over-the-top performances as the Dursleys. Alan Rickman oozes contempt as Severus Snape, the lone teacher who can't stand Harry. And Dame Maggie Smith lets everyone know who's in charge as the stern Professor McGonagall.<br/><br/>The cast of children are sometimes hit-and-miss, but overall there are more hits. Daniel Radcliffe usually makes a compelling lead as Harry Potter, although there are a couple of points where he seems to be just making sure he gets out his lines. Likewise, Rupert Grint (as best mate Ron Weasley) has a little trouble playing off other characters, although his comic timing is usually good. Emma Watson is not afraid to show off as the bossy, sometimes pretentious, but ultimately clever and well-intended Hermione Granger. She tends to get the best bits of comedy in the film; I laughed the hardest when, after Harry breaks a rule that could lead to his expulsion, Watson mutters with pure pretentious contempt, ""What- an- idiot."" One other child actor who makes a good, evil impression is Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy. I need not mention how much of a shock it was seeing all of these actors so young after watching them in ""The Half-Blood Prince""!<br/><br/>Steven Kloves wrote the script, and while I wish he had let some scenes last longer, he makes up for that by trying to keep focus on the characters in Hogwarts and inserting a good amount of humor into the film. Kloves, probably trying to ensure he could please as many book readers as possible, sticks close to the original text, and that leads to both good and not-so-good traits of the film. While there are plenty of random pleasures, the direction of the story doesn't become very clear until halfway through.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus would not have been my first choice for director but he holds his own here. He clearly takes a great interest into the sheer wonder of the world of magic, and he strikes many tones correctly in the picture, from comic (anything with the Dursleys), to horrific (in the Forbidden Forest), and to emotive (the first encounter with the Mirror of Erised, one of the rare scenes that feels as long as it should). Still, some scenes leave more of a punch to be desired. When poor Neville Longbottom accidentally goes veering into walls on a broomstick, Columbus doesn't perfectly capture how absurd it it that Madam Hooch's reaction is for him to somehow come back down on his own will. No wonder J.K. Rowling had Terry Gilliam as one of her first choices for director.<br/><br/>Two other quibbles significantly bring down the picture. The first is a plot inconsistency. ""Voldemort"" is apparently a name that is so feared, people say ""You-Know-Who"" instead. However, these same character tend to quickly proceed to say ""Voldemort"" anyway. I'm kind of surprised Columbus, Kloves, and editor Richard Francis Bruce somehow missed this. Second, the special effects, while usually effective, sometimes get too herky-jerky, particularly during the Quidditch game.<br/><br/>Still, those are minor to what I consider to be the greatest strength of ""The Sorcerer's Stone""... THE SCORE! John Williams perfectly captures all of the appropriate feelings of the film, molding the music into becoming integral to the storytelling itself. No doubt Williams would have won the Oscar had it not been for Howard Shore's also brilliant score to the first ""Lord of the Rings"" film. Frequently while watching this film, I found myself simply listening to the picture, allowing John's score to carry me through the scene. I strongly believe that had his score not been in this film, my score would be a 7 and not an 8.<br/><br/>So there you have it. While ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is probably not the best installment in the Harry Potter series, it is nonetheless effective. There's good acting, great production design, fantastic visuals, funny comedy, a great deal of wonder, and all sorts of other things that make this an entertaining and fast-moving film. The sense of joy I got back in 2001 isn't there anymore, but there's still pleasure, and that's good enough."

So when I first saw this movie, it was spectacular, I was 3, but I still know my mum said it was my favourite film. <br/><br/>It was only when I had read the book and decided to watch it again, that I noticed that it lacked a lot from the book, mostly the funny comments from Fred and George, and also Dumbledore's very funny madness. It missed out the most of the beginning of the book, which I would've liked to see, as in the: Uncle Vernon noticing odd looking people in cloaks, Harry being hugged by a cloak- wearer while shopping, and Uncle Vernon being told how ""You-Know-Who is now gone, even muggles shall celebrate this day"".<br/><br/>I chuckled a lot while reading the book, and it had been so long since I'd seen the film I thought I'd revisit it. However, it turned out that the moments I chuckled at in the book weren't there in the film. Especially Fred & George, my main reason for laughing.<br/><br/>But yes the film was spectacular, though very different from the new films of it's series, which, if I'm not mistaken, have different directors on them. <br/><br/>I do, however, think that this director, went a little bit too far in trying to make it seem like his previous child films, in that the children, though the heroes in the end, have occasional ""child"" moments, which can be described as their ""stupid"" moments... e.g- their late reaction to Fluffy.<br/><br/>Overall the film is a great film, but indeed not the best of it's series, which for me personally, has to be the Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>All round, it is a good film, though."

The faith shown by the producers of the film in the three young leads is repaid enormously and Daniel Radcliffe pulls off an astonishingly accomplished performance as Harry.<br/><br/>There are many wonderful British actors in this film, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Zoe Wanamaker, Ian Hart, Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt - it is a treat to watch them at work.<br/><br/>A super film with excellent sets and affects that support the whole structure of this film that is delivered through superb comic acting and tells a vibrant and enjoyable story"

","I had not read any of the Harry Potter-books when this came out but like most people in the world i easily knew who Harry Potter was before I heard they were going to make the book into a movie. After i saw the first film, i could see why people loved the story. The story is very fresh but that isn't something you see lately in other fantasy stories. It also brings in a lot of knew things into the genre that have stayed with us until now. The characters are colorful to say the least and very memorable but that is the main thing when you are writing a series of books, to make the characters likable and memorable. This world J.K Rowling has made is quite charming and beautiful.<br/><br/>Fantasy movies are often very badly done but here Harry Potter is a step in the right direction. The movie looks fantastic and good acting is found in every corner.<br/><br/>Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt all do great and really gave them self's all into their roles, not only being seen like to often happens when stars like these are casted. The movie is all about the three little kids Harry Potter, Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger, who are delivered to you by the talented Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emmu Watson. Grint was the man to look at, he was funny and just right for the part or so I have been told, he didn't fail in any scene and that is amazing for a kid at his age. Radcliff looks the part alright and does a solid job in his role but at times he overacts for no reason like for example the scene where Hagrid tels Harry ""You're a wizard Harry!"" but still for a kid at his age, he does an amazing job. Watson is wonderful as the self-involved Hermione and makes a very colorful character.<br/><br/>One of the most positive things about this movie is how quickly the movie went by, even being more then two hours. It's either because of the script-writer Steve Kloves who wrote the great Wonder Boys or the director himself but either way it's quite wonderful to be so intrigued and entertained at the same time that two and a half hours goes by like nothing. I don't know the book but the story seems to work alright and I felt nothing really needed to be added. There is enough of action to see like with the Quidditch-game or the obstacles. The main mystery is also quite strangely exiting and it really dragged me into the movie. Chris Colombus does a wonderful job introducing the world and letting the viewer get sucked in.<br/><br/>The movie could have been a lot darker but knowing now it will get darker and darker with every movie, it's not something I can really complain about. I am not talking about any Tim Burton style, I just know that the book was quite darker.<br/><br/>8/10 -- There's a lot of charm in this movie and it was probably my favorite movie that has ever come out at Christmas."

He became friend with Ron and Hermione, and they became best friends each other. When this was showed as a movie, I was so glad. Director have done good job, because he showed real Harry Potter's world. My favorite is moving picture. Many picture is moving at the world; newspapers, portrait, book's cover etc. Also I was moved by final scene which Griffin dole won among another team, because they threw own hat at so big hall.

","I believe credit should be given where it is deserved. If a person is inspired by someone else's imagination then he/she should own up to it. What are the odds that two separate people will follow the same genre and name the main character with the same first and last name. I don't know what those odds are but I'll bet they're pretty astronomical. The name Harry Potter was the original name of the hero boy in the movie ""Troll"" (1986). The story also involves a fantasy world with a witch, sorceress, wizard, troll forest nymph and magic. Harry even asked if he could be the sorceress's apprentice. Let's be fair, ""Troll"" was probably the inspiration for the Harry Potter books and movies. Because I respect my sister's judgment and she and her daughters speaks so highly of the Harry Potter stories, I'll give it a 9."

","I was not into Harry Potter growing up, the books were forced upon me by my mother, and as a result I refused to read any of them, or have anything to do with the movies. Well last year, I finally decided to give in and have a look at them, and I started with the original, aka this one. This is now my 2nd time viewing it, and I enjoyed it even more than I did the 1st time around. I'm really not into these kinds of movies usually, they just don't interest me, but I was truly surprised by the amount of thrills it provided me with, the laughs and the likable characters it had as well. The trio of Harry, Ron and Hermoine make the perfect hero's for the movie, the movie leans heavily on them and it pays off. The final showdown between Harry and Voldermort had me on the edge of my seat. Just watching Harry go through what he did, with Hermoine and Ron was absolutely amazing. One of my favorite bits had to be the big chess game bit, it was surreal, but thrilling to watch at the same time.<br/><br/>Performances. Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and does well for a kid his age. He is able to carry the bulk of the film for the most part, like a pro, I was quite impressed. Rupert Grint is good as Ronald. He often had me chuckling with his bumbling magician act. Emma Watson is cute, and shows a lot of poise for her age. She had a unique charisma, that kept me drawn to her. Tom Felton is good as the egotistical kid Draco. John Cleese has a funny cameo as nearly headless Nick. Alan Rickman is great in everything he does, and he is no different here as Snape. Maggie Smith does good as the female professor, I liked her. Robbie Coltrane steals the scenes many times as Hagrid. He's goofy, but in a good way, I loved him. Richard Harris is great as Dumbeldore. He had something magical about him, when he appeared on-screen. Well known faces like John Hurt, Warwick Davis, and Verne Troyer appear as well.<br/><br/>Bottom line. The Sorcerer's Stone is purely magical. It's thrilling, exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. Harry Potter has something for every age, and if you were like me, really iffy about the whole thing, give it a shot!.<br/><br/>9/10"

"hte-trasme","7","0","1","21 January 2010"," Movie magic?
","I was shown this film today without having ever read the novel for comparison of impressions. Yes, I am the one who has never read the novel. That said, I came away from the film adaptation impressed. Once one knows this is a film version of a popular book signs of it are obvious, but this is by no means necessarily a flaw. As befits the length of Harry Potter books this film is long, and that means it has the opportunity to luxuriate in introducing characters and situations while slowing building the final elements of danger into the plot. One of its greatest strengths is the detailed vast, and appealing parallel fantasy world that it creates for its characters. This comes alive both in a the writing and in the visually wonderful film-making, which shows a big budget wisely spent. There are countless brief offhand references to parts of the Wizard world which bespeak an authentically well-developed universe.<br/><br/>The length, and presumably, the desire to adapt as many elements as possible contribute to a certain meandering quality, which however does not detract. I could forget about expecting the film to end and enjoy learning about an imagined sport or system of spell-casting in a nicely-imagined universe. This is a film that clearly has a good amount of reverence for itself, but unlike most self-reverent things it has ample room for humor and there are a good number of funny scenes and lines. Still, the sententious manner in which certain names are intoned or the rise of the theme music whenever a set-piece that many viewers already know will be important shows up occasionally grates. While the world itself seems very detailed through the roundabout way we learn about it, sometimes this leads to details about the important characters being slightly unclear to the non-reader when they come into play.<br/><br/>There's not too much moral depth here either (funnily, it's the evil villain who declares that ""there is no good or evil""), as we're clearly supposed to know immediately who to like who not to like. This is turned over on us with a twist at the end, but still a little more humanity for the characters destined to be evil would have been nice.<br/><br/>There is a great cast here of talented British character actors here whom I won't name, but they all do excellently and it's great to see them all. The child actors are wooden once in a blue moon but by and large carry the film surprisingly well and are commendably well-picked.<br/><br/>The story and setting here are a great fantasy-fulfillment tale, and the movie is lots of fun on many counts. I can't say whether as an adaptation it was successful but as a film it was very entertaining."

","Yet face, if a book sales well, it is bound to made into a film, regardless of quality, or even if it is filmable. This is true for books like Twilight, the Golden Compass (or Northern Lights what it's really called) and Dan Brown's thrillers. J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series became one of the most popular series of books of all time, appealing to children and adults. There were written in a assessable style, with a clear and strong narrative, but with a good deal of backstory. A film adaption became enviable.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first book, and film of the series, starting with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) as an 11-year-old boy, raised as a regular human (muggle) child by his aunt and uncle. He is abused, forced to live in a small cupboard under the stairs whiles his cousin is spoiled rotten. But Harry's life is changed when he finds out that he had been admitted to Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches. He discoveries that he is a celebrity in the wizardry world, but does not know his own family history. Whiles in Hogwarts Harry makes friends with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the three end up working together. Harry becomes the new star of the Quidditch team, and Hermione is the brains of the operation. The three believe that a threat to Hogwarts, with the Dark Wizard Lord Voldermort wanting the Philosopher's Stone hidden in Hogwarts and using his old follower Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) to get it.<br/><br/>When this film was in pre-production a number of big-name directors were attached, including Terry Gilliam, M. Night Shyamalan, Alan Parker, Brad Silberling, Baz Luhrmann and even Steven Spielberg. Spielberg planned making the film animated with Haley Joel Osment doing the voice, luckily this never got off the ground. J.K. Rowling preferred was Terry Gilliam, an excellent director with great vision, but could be a handful with the film going overbudget. Warner Brothers settled for Chris Columbus, a director with a decent reputation for family films, like Home Alone and Mrs Doubtfire. He offers a steady hand, knowing what to do, having fun with CGI and light moments of comedy, as well trying to be like Spielberg involving sentimental moments. But he is not so good on the darker elements of the story, hedge why other directors were brought in for later films. Columbus is basically a safe pair of hands to start things off until the films could stand on their own legs.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling insisted that the cast for the film should have been all British and Irish. The studio played alone and it was a wise move, much like the Bond movies. It was have betrayed fans and non-fans to see an American Harry with either him in end up going to England or transferring the action to America. There is an excellent cast with actors like Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, John Hurt, just to name a few. The type of film Harry Potter is it did not need a massive A-Lister like Brad Pitt or Will Smith, just good actors. The young actors who played the main three actors were however, not great. They were young, child actors with little experience, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint only acted in school plays. They do however improve in latter films, and we can forgive them because they were young and Chris Columbus isn't known for getting great performers from actors.<br/><br/>The Philosopher's Stone is the most light-hearted of the films. They is good action and a fun story. Making the film a good start to the Harry Potter series, keeping it going to 2011."

Really a super-cute kid's fantasy film while the future ones went darker and deeper, I still find this first one very enjoyable and watchable.<br/><br/>As kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson (Harry, Ron, Hermione, respectively) were infectiously adorable! There's an utter innocence in them in this first entry that hearkens one back to when things were simple. Thankfully, they have some major adults to back them up! Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, and especially Alan Rickman! Sadly, Mr. Harris is no longer with us (he was in the 2nd one CHAMBER OF SECRETS thankfully), but the rest have continued on throughout the series to keep it faithful and strong!<br/><br/>SORCERER'S STONE, while not especially deep, does have some wonderful set pieces: the Hogwarts train ride, the exciting Quidditch match (Harry's first!) and the climactic Wizard's chess scene! But mainly, the directer Christopher Columbus does an admirable job introducing the viewer to this magical world without it ever devolving into insipid sappiness.

","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. An amazing adaption from J.K Rowling's classic novel. Every time I see this work of art, it's a mesmerising experience. <br/><br/>I get butterflies witnessing of how the lack of production, captivation and spell-binding magic is incorporated into the making of this masterpiece. <br/><br/>From start to the climax. This film is beautifully translated from the book to the movie. There were no unnecessary parts extending the film. It kept a steady profile of reflecting the acquaintance of the book to the scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>However some parts from the book were torn off (such as Harry's meeting with Draco Malfoy in Diagon Alley) causing a bit of a slight letdown. Moreover, I fully understand the producer's reasonable concept to make this movie generally simple. Avoiding no-needed parts from the book, intimidating the plot to drive away and lose it's connection to the novel. <br/><br/>Though I'm still happy that some parts from the book were transported to another scene in the movie (such as Snape's talk with Quirell). <br/><br/>Other than that, the presentation and effort put in to this movie is forever brilliant.

","Java Man Reviews ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com December, 2001.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>As an infant, Harry Potter (Radcliffe) was deposited on the doorstep of his mean aunt and uncle, and has been living with them and sleeping in a cupboard below the stairs. On his 11th birthday he learns that he's a wizard when he's invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. Once he arrives at the paranormal prep school he becomes friends with the clever Hermione (Watson) and the courageous Ron (Grint). He also encounters the hilariously outlandish instructors (Harris, Smith, Rickman and Hart) and the gruff but gentle groundskeeper (Coltrane). While Harry and his friends compete with the other houses on campus, they are also drawn into an adventure involving a mysterious wizard who wants to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. The courage and cleverness of his friends rubs off on Harry and, as the movie ends, his life as a young wizard is... just beginning. <br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 1/2 of 4 Java Mugs <br/><br/>The movie version of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series has been long awaited by young readers and their parents, and they won't be disappointed. The screenplay is quite faithful to the book and is fascinating enough to hold any audience's attention despite the 2 1/2 hour length. Episodes are strung together without much transition or explanation but this is a minor fault, since it allows that much more of the story to reach the screen. The dialogue is fast paced and witty, with plenty of high-spirited humor.<br/><br/>Some of the movie's best lines come from Coltrane's character who keeps amazing himself by revealing secrets he is supposed to keep. Radcliffe admirably inhabits Harry's trademark eyeglasses and closely matches the visual image that has emerged from the buzz around book series. As the character closest to ""normal,"" he is our guide into the movie's weird and wonderful world. Watson and Grint are also delightful as his cohorts in conjuring. The witches and wizards who run the arcane academy are played with enormous relish by some of the best British actors at work today, led by Harris, Rickman, Hart and Smith (who, like Jean Brodie, seems forever in her prime).<br/><br/>There are wizards off-screen, too -- those in charge of bringing key episodes to life. Lavish cinematography and imaginative set design capture the central images of the book, including the high-flying Quidditch match (played on turbo-powered broomsticks) and the crucial Wizard's chess match. Computer visuals are combined with actual locations to give the setting a sort of realistic unreality. John Williams' superb score further enlivens many of the key scenes. <br/><br/>And there's more to come. Kloves has already written the screenplay for the second installment and is currently adapting the third novel, while Rowling is about to publish her fifth book in the series."

When I watch this film now, what strikes me most is the age of the actors: they are SO young! But in terms of the film, no one could have done a better job introducing audiences to Harry Potter's world. You don't need to read the book to know what's going on in the film; the exposition fairies are excellent throughout, and the wonderment of the Wizard world is clear for all of us.<br/><br/>Characters are established, settings are imprinted in the minds of viewers, and the over-arching plot of the seven books gets off to a great start in this film.<br/><br/>It's a little long, in an interesting paradox/twist: the first books were shorter and were extrapolated for longer films, while the later books were longer and chopped for their film versions."

She is excellently portrayed and one of my favorite characters. <br/><br/>I was disappointed that the population of Hogwarts wasn't depicted as being more diverse in ethnicity and ages as it was in the book. But one of the things I love the most about Rowling is that she doesn't have ethnic stereotyping in her books at all. There is a wonderful level of diversity in her characters, but she doesn't beat you over the head with it. Race doesn't matter in the world she created; what matters is whether you can do magic and if your parents are ""pure"" blooded. It is a really excellent way of having the readers take a step back away from the issue of race to better see the absurdity of judging others by their magical abilities or some other superficiality.<br/><br/>Well anyways, this was a good movie for all generations and my son and I really enjoyed it."

Along the journey he makes new friends and enemies while learning magic and overcoming the evil that spelt the end for his parents.<br/><br/>This movie(unlike some of the later films) is very faithful to the book but also is a great movie by itself, allowing people who have never read the books to be entertained just as much as already established fans.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is overall very good. The child actors are decent but there are times when it shows plain and clear that this is their first movie and they're still getting comfortable with being in front of the camera. Two of the children though that really stood out were Rupert Grint as Harry's best pal Ron Weasley. He captured the lovable and sarcastic charm of Ron to perfection. Tom Felton as Harry's rival and Slytherin enemy, Draco Malfoy also shines.<br/><br/>The real meat of the great acting in this movie and also becomes a defining factor in the series, is the adult actors. The Harry Potter series manages to assemble some of Britain's best actors. Alan Rickman is perfect as the cold and ruthless Professor Snape while Richard Harris brings Dumbledore perfectly to life. There are many more great British actors such as Maggie Smith, Robbie Coultran, and many others.<br/><br/>The special effects are good but nowadays, you can occasionally catch some of the mistakes.<br/><br/>Overall while not being my favorite of the series, Sorcerer's Stone delivers as a great starting point to the saga of Harry Potter!"

With that much anticipation, there are some serious expectations for Warner Brothers' behemoth franchise-to-be, and gladly the pay-off of seeing it all for the first time makes ""Sorcerer's Stone"" a success with Potter fans.<br/><br/>As for those who never picked up the book, there might be a good portion among them who aren't left spellbound. The enormous project suffers a bit out of fear of failing the fans, which is fair as they're the target audience -- along with families in general. That's where the choice for Chris Columbus to produce and direct becomes the level-headed choice. With credits including both ""Home Alone"" films and ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" Columbus clearly knows how to work with kids -- and there is a lot of that work needing to be done with young actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson taking most of the screen time. All three are quite talented for having barely a credit to their names and Columbus deserves much of the praise for their performance.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is pretty remarkable: a who's who of outstanding British acting (and some Scottish). Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonnagal, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, John Hurt as Mr. Olivander, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Alan Rickman who is brilliantly chilling as the mean, stone-faced Professor Snape. Each of them clearly talented enough to bring these characters to life not just visually but with complexity. They are like the respected elders of the film and we bow our heads to them.<br/><br/>At the same time, the first Harry Potter is a much more childish film full of good vs. evil clichÃ©. Maybe the attribution should go to the desire to not get slapped with anything more than a PG rating, which is understandable, but it dilutes the mystique of the novels. The art direction (with lavish sets and costumes) makes the film carry its own magical quality just like the book, but it's the dramatic storytelling that's not as breath-taking. <br/><br/>Part of that problem belongs to the challenge of adapting the book. Steve Kloves (""Wonder Boys"") proves an interesting choice, but I wouldn't wish this assignment on anyone. Kloves opts for taking the maximum time producers would give him (two and a half hours -- too much for a family film) and crams as much book material as he can into it. Not exactly the best way to do it, but the safest as far as fan-pleasing goes. ""Sorcerer's Stone"" ends up vaulting from scene to scene and the result is that Harry goes from boy who didn't know wizards existed to wizard student with the knowledge that strangers wouldn't just carry dragon eggs in about an hour and a half. The story still gives Harry time to charm us and express his fears and wishes to know his parents, but his hero's journey is undermined by sheer desire to fill the screen with as many magical elements from the book as possible.<br/><br/>""Sorcerer's Stones"" will certainly satisfy fans' itches and entertain them at a high level of quality, which I can say falling into that category, but it's a bit too much like a really long race because of its commitment to book obedience (and I'm sure plenty was missing too). But seeing it all come to life is enough to entertain the masses and provoke the imaginations of nearly all who sit down and watch."

","This movie is the only movie that i watched more than five times. At the beginning, i was trying to focus on the details of the movie and the book to compare the different between those. But later on, the more i watched it, the more i felt i like it because of all of the effects they put on the film. Even some parts of the movie was not the same as the book and the details were cut off to make the film shorter, the film still make people understand the situations and the details of the book. One of the most important thing i like about the movie is that the character of the movie were very successful in acting and let people feel more interesting about the film."
"robert-temple-1","9","0","1","13 April 2009"," Nicolas Flamel Strikes Again
","As the first of the famous Harry Potter films, this one managed to restrain its special effects sufficiently not to overwhelm the viewers with too many dazzling visuals at the expense of the story and the amusing characters. The result is most entertaining, and Emma Watson was perfectly cast as the character Hermione. The production is full of famous actors, some recognisable, some not. Robbie Coltrane is particularly effective and endearing, with a broad Somerset accent, of all things! Maggie Smith has little to do but wrinkle her nose. But there is little point in discussing a production which has been reviewed to death and talked about until everyone has lost their breath, and there is nothing to add about all that. In America, this film title used the phrase 'sorcerer's stone' because Americans were presumably considered too ill-educated to know what the Philosopher's Stone is. In Britain and Canada, the title used the correct phrase of 'the Philosopher's Stone'. The Philosopher's Stone (correctly shown in the film as being red in colour) is reputed to have existed, but no one is certain. It was the end-product of alchemy, and had the ability to turn all metals into gold if you sprinkled a little of it on, say, lead, for instance. It also could produce a medicine to allow you to live indefinitely in good health, perhaps for centuries. J. K. Rowling sticks some genuine esoterica into her stories sometimes, and in this one she incorporated the fourteenth century alchemist Nicolas Flamel, whose presumed dates are sometimes given as 1330-1418. He really existed, and his tombstone may be seen in the Musee de Cluny in Paris, on the left as you go up a staircase, affixed to a wall. The staff of the Museum either do not know or pretend not to know who Flamel is, and 'if ye seek ye shall not find', as they all look blank. As far as I know, I may be the only person who has fully deciphered the symbology of this strange stone. Flamel faked his own death to avoid arrest and imprisonment by the French king, who wanted to keep him captive and force him to make gold for him. The tombstone was designed by Flamel himself before he disappeared. For a long time it rested in place in the nave of the Paris church of Saint-Jacques la Boucherie, but that church was demolished long ago, with only its high tower remaining. The Tour Saint-Jacques has now had its scaffolding removed, and is looking splendid and clean. It has long been the symbol of modern French esotericism (which the French call esoterisme), and a famous French esoteric periodical even bore its name. The tombstone was salvaged from the demolition and used for many years, turned upside-down, as a chopping-board for herbs, by a herb-seller in his shop. It was recognised in the 19th century and preserved by an antiquary. The old stone house of Flamel, known as 'the oldest house in Paris', still stands and you can go and eat there in a small and expensive restaurant called after Flamel. There are even two little streets in the vicinity of the Tour named Rue Nicolas Flamel and Rue Perenelle, the latter of which is named for his wife and alchemical collaborator. In the film, Flamel is said still to be alive, and the Stone is his, although he does not appear in the story himself. What happened to Flamel, who was Fulcanelli, all of these things are continuing mysteries which are far more interesting than any J. K. Rowling story. Nevertheless, it is good that young people are being given a small dose of these things in palatable form by Rowling, as it might open their minds, if they can stop texting trivia to each other for long enough to allow their minds to be opened, that is."

","In the series! Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (OR Philosophers stone) is a wonderful fictional fantasy tale with excellent effects and plenty of film debuts. I'm one to say this movie equals up to the standards of the book (written by JK Rolling), and accurately portraits some of the scenes that were found within the book. The acting is just average, there is certainly no stand-put performances, but I guess its the ""cool"" effects and ""great ending"" that gave Harry Potter so much publicity and attention. This lives on as one of my favourite fantasy tales. A excellent movie, with wicked characters, some humor, and a fantastic ending."
"Stampsfightclub","8","0","1","6 March 2009"," Fine reminder of where the magic all began
","Raised by a family who detests him, Harry Potter (Radcliffe) learns he is a wizard and soon finds himself at school of magic Hogwarts.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine in the 90's J.K Rowling being rejected a contract for her wizard series. The Harry Potter franchise has spun further than many anticipated and this film reminds us of the moment when the franchise really took off and some magic really happened.<br/><br/>Almost 8 years ago now and current renowned teen stars Radcliffe, Watson and Grint star in their first roles as the famous friends Harry, Hermione and Ron, all with a magical gift. So the acting is far from perfect, it hardly matters now when you watch the series as the actors learn from their mistakes and we see them growing up and facing more challenging tests, for their characters and for themselves.<br/><br/>It is however the older actors who generate the magic of acting. Alan Rickman was born to play Snape whilst Richard Harris fits the role of Dumbledore like a glove.<br/><br/>But this is all about the story of a young unappreciated boy who was born in a different lifetime from his adoptive parents the Dursleys. Struggling under the strain of life Harry is thrown a lifeline when he arrives at Hogwarts, a chance to make friends and live life as he wants. This is an entertaining 2 hour picture that generates laughs, mystery and excitement in the form of a different world. The concept of magic is always tricky to cover in terms of realism but J.K Rowling's imagination is frequently present here and is adapted with some gusto in this 2001 fantasy adventure.<br/><br/>However where this film offers spills and thrills consistently there is so much missing from the book. More imagination and excitement appears on the pages where we see more characters are introduced. Therefore it is worth reading before viewing, s with all the instalments.<br/><br/>John Williams' score fits the scene perfectly whereas Chris Columbus' direction is good, you can't but feel the elements of magic could have been justified to generate a bit more surprise. Nevertheless the Quidditch match is some of the finest sporting direction you will ever see in the franchise.<br/><br/>This first part is a humorous and enthralling family adventure that does enough good justice to the book and with some good performances is a fine reminder of where the young stars started and where the franchise really begun."
"anifanmc","7","0","1","16 February 2009"," An acceptable enough origin story
","I'll preface this review by saying that I did not treat this as I would the other Harry Potter films due to its nature as (a) a first film foray into the world of Harry Potter and (b) an origin story. It is inevitably going to be exposition-heavy and heavy-handed in its treatment of the characters, and the plot is always going to be as literally adapted as possible. Christopher Columbus, while probably not the best director for this job, nevertheless managed to pull it off without doing a terrible job. Had this been judged as any other Potter film, however, it would probably have received a 4/10 as it was possibly one of the worst in comparison to the others.<br/><br/>The story is a straight adaptation of Rowling's first Potter book. Young Harry is rescued from a life of misery, neglect and cruelty at the hands of his aunt, uncle and cousin when he learns that he's a wizard and is destined to attend the famous Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry - the British learning institution for magical folk. Compounded by this is that he discovers he is an involuntary celebrity in the magical world because of the manner in which he was orphaned. An evil wizard, Voldemort, killed his parents when he was a child but was unable to kill him and was robbed of his powers and a body - and nobody understands why.<br/><br/>Up to this point, Columbus does his magic. He portrays the world of Hogwarts beautifully (although the following films were able to do a much better job of it) and in a manner that is faithful to the novel, he shows how Harry meets Ron and Hermione, his closest friends, and introduces the main entourage of characters with equal grace (Harry's classmates, Malfoy, Snape, McGonagall and the other teachers, Hagrid, and most importantly, Dumbledore). He discards events and truncates the length of certain scenes but leaves the essential parts.<br/><br/>Then, of course, the main plot of the film is discussed. A powerful object known as the Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone in the oddly named American version) is being hidden at Hogwarts, which grants the user immortality and limitless wealth. Harry is suspicious of a teacher, and does his damndest to try and stop him, and his fears are worsened by the realization that the person trying to steal the stone isn't doing so for personal gain, but to return Voldemort, the killer of his parents, back to power.<br/><br/>This bit, Columbus does not handle as well. He did not cast someone significant for Voldemort when he makes his appearance and as such there is a disconnect when Fiennes' Voldemort makes his appearance in the fourth film, and opts instead to CGI Voldemort into existence. He takes creative liberties with the traps that are used to hide the stone, and eliminates a few altogether (although that at least was somewhat acceptable). However, his biggest blunder was leaving out crucial scenes which establish Harry's suspicions. It becomes important in later books (and by extension, later films) and isn't handled properly.<br/><br/>That being said, the film gains considerable strength of character from Richard Harris' Albus Dumbledore. He has more or less defined the face of Dumbledore and his acting capability is far superior to that of the farcical, ridiculous Gambon. As for my recommendation, if you're a Potter fan and haven't seen this film for whatever reason, I would give it a try anyway, just to see the strengths in his adaptation. A tentative ""yes"" from me does not exempt it from the fact that the film has some serious flaws."

He goes to Hogwarts School to study wizardry. And he has the ultimate confrontation with the main bad guy, Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>The cast, notably Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Robbie Coltrane, is colorful and enticing to watch.

","There are well over 1,100 comments preceding thus one. Everything from praise to condemnation has already been voiced. So why another comment? Why not? The film isn't faithful to the text of the book, though it's fairly faithful to the spirit behind the book. As the opening of the Harry Potter saga, a lot of the film, as with the book, is introducing newcomers to the world of the young wizard. Meeting the characters -- Harrym Hagridm Ron, Hermione, and the like -- is important, and in the film, they're fairly well established. The whole magical world of Wizardkind is introduced, but shortcuts had to be made.<br/><br/>Harry's flying sequences had to be trimmed, though his elation at being a natural flayers, and some of his Quidditch practice were excised, more's the pity. Likewise, Harry becoming Seeker was a secret in the book, but the talk of the school in the film.<br/><br/>The fundamentals remain. The film is not the book, but it's close enough so that someone who's not roast the books first could be charmed by the film into starting to read them."
"I_Am_The_Taylrus","8","0","1","1 November 2008"," A Whimsical Beginning To One of the Most Beloved Series of All Time
","I am an avid fan of the Harry Potter series. I have read every book, seen every movie, and tried to find out everything there is to know about the series. Well, this is the first book, and movie, of the series. It is safe to say that this is a wonderful beginning to the series of Harry Potter movies. This kept to the book quite nicely. Not much seemed to be cut, aside from some minor situations and events, although it is quite sad to see a character like Peeves the Poltergeist to be on the cutting room floor. To be honest, I saw this film when I was quite young, and I thought that all of the characters fit J.K. Rowling's descriptions perfectly. Now older, I feel the same way, but that may be because your childhood memories are memorable.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is an ordinary boy with no special talent, right? He lives with his dreadful relatives after his parents mysteriously died. Then, on an ordinary day, a letter comes. Then another. Then another. Also, a half-giant comes to inform Harry that he is a wizard and he has been accepted to Hogwarts School and Witchcraft and Wizardry. There, at Hogwarts, Harry discovers a world like no other, crammed with talking, and nearly-headless, ghosts, poltergeists, wizards, witches, true friends, and secrets. Secrets that Harry never knew about. Secrets that will reveal more than Harry bargained for.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, simply put. It is full of wonderful special effects, a sometimes dark, sometimes cheery, atmosphere, some nice work from the adult and child actors, although that the children can be a bit over-the-top at times. No matter, though. Chris Columbus does a nice job covering the book from page-to-page, without deleting too much important elements. My main complaint is that Columbus does not do anything unique for the film. He chooses to stick to the book, and that's it. He does the same with Chamber of Secrets. The other directors for the other books put their own different spin on the story. Columbus just makes it all about the book, which is fine, but fans of the books may want to have a little more. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to any fan of the Harry Potter series of books, a little adventure, or any lover of fantasy in general.<br/><br/>8/10"
"KillerLord","10","0","1","9 October 2008"," Could Not Be Better Than This! Simply Delightful! Must Watch For All Ages!
","The amount of time that I can get on my hands to read books is very less and hence it was always my last choice to read a Harry Potter book considering that it is meant for the children. No amount of hype about the Harry Potter book could ever drive me to read the book. I always would resort to alternate reading. And then one fine day, I saw this computer game of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I enjoyed playing it and it was through the game I came to know the story of Harry Potter. I felt that it was so brilliantly done. I began to wonder whether it was the creativity of the game designers that created this world or was it the sheer genius of the author to make us imagine such a world. I decided to find out and finally read the book. And it was then I realized that Rowling had indeed created a whole new world for us and so fresh it was.<br/><br/>Finally came the movie for me. I decided that I wanted to see the movie. And I was delighted watching this movie. The whole new world this movie exposes to is so filled with delight and cheer. The child cast is amazing. Each one convinces us that he or she fits the shoes of the character they are playing. At no point of time, one gets the feeling that ""Oh, this is not how Rowling described it!"" The movie and all the characters have been created with wonderful precision staying as faithful as possible to original descriptions penned down in the book. <br/><br/>The computer animations and special effects are simply amazing. It is hard to imagine that so much of CGI is involved in the movie. It is so wonderfully done that one might wonder if such a world does exist and all the movie makers had to do was to use the camera to capture it. The movie makers have spared no effort in creating the world of Harry Potter. Every single scene is so well thought out. This movie deserves all the praise it has got. <br/><br/>The book and the movie is no doubt targeted at the children but I am sure that even the adults are going to love this movie. Somewhere deep inside all of us there is a child who wants magic with whose aid we may forget the perils of the world in which we live and escape into a dream of fantasies. This movie provides us just that. The world in this movie is so alive, so cheerful and so delightful. This is one of most amazing and fresh movies in years. A must watch for all movie goers independent of whether you have read the book or not. <br/><br/>Truly amazing!"
"Sterling52","8","0","1","21 September 2008"," A faithful adaptation
","I will always think fondly of this movie because it inspired me to pick up the first Harry Potter book and I've been a rabid fan ever since. I'm one of those book before movie people so I had to read the novel in order to go see this movie and I was pleased to see that it was such a faithful adaptation to Rowling's wonderful tale. This movie did a wonderful job of capturing the wonder and awe of the first HP novel. Hogwarts was an especially lovely effect and when Harry first walks into the Great Hall and all the candles are floating overhead, I felt all the magic I felt when reading those words on the page. I think Columbus and crew captured the essence of the castle and somehow managed to create a visual of something so fantastical. The casting of the movie was also extremely well done. I adore Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Richard Harris captures the mischievous and wise nature of Dumbledore. Perhaps best of all the adult casting is that of Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. He looks exactly as I pictured the character but, more importantly, he captures Hagrid's rather childlike nature and the accent is wonderful. Coltrane doesn't just portray Hagrid, he is Hagrid. I also thought the children were wonderfully cast. Daniel Radcliffe looks like Harry and I fought back tears when his earnest young face first looked into the Mirror of Erised. Rupert Grint looks just as I pictured Ron Weasley and Emma Watson is wonderfully bossy and a fantastic know-it-all as Hermione Granger. The casting of the Phelps brothers as the Weasley twins was absolutely brilliant and I think they were dead on in their interpretation of the lovable scoundrels. Yet in spite of its fantastical nature, this film, like the book, feels as though it is something like our own reality. There are many wonderful things in Harry's world but it's not that different from our own. The same prejudices and the same human frailties that exist in our world exist in Harry's. Though being a wizard is pretty darn cool, it's not the answer to Harry's problems and the film makes clear that he has some difficult challenges ahead of him. I think the central theme of this movie is one that is invaluable for both children and adults alike: that love is the most powerful magic that exists. Even with all the wand waving and fantastical creatures, it is love that is Harry's salvation."

","I got to admit; when this movie came out, I loved it. It was charming and got a great sense of magic. But it's too cliché in someways... and is it just me; or are they stupefying Harry all the time in the movie? They are saying things like ""Don't you know that?!"" and ""Everyone knows that!""..... I mean, jeez... have they no respect for beginners at all? Especially Hagrid and Hermione... And yeah, about Hermione; she is really disturbed. She believes her to be a better person than everyone else, and is always bitching around. And when Ron says the fact that actually disturbs her and makes her sad, she is actually running so near them when she passes; it's obvious she DID want their attentions to her... what a bitch. And let me ask you this; why does Harry's scar only hurt.... WHEN HE BLOODY TOUCHES IT?!! That's just plain silly. But I can't get too strict about this movie. Sure, the CGI effects sucks (pointing at the troll especially) and it's a little bit of a silly story. But it's charming, in it's own way. The problem is this though; they didn't stop after this one. J.K. Rowling was also stupid enough to have more books... but you could technical say Voldemort dies in this movie. But NO; he can come back in maaaany more ways.... and I really don't care.<br/><br/>I give it 3 of 5 hats."

One little thing though: In the movie scene which Professor McGonagall goes to fetch Wood, captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and tells him that she had found him a new seeker, Harry (after seeing him flying through the air, retrieving Neville's Remembrall that Malfoy threw into the air), the classroon Professor McGonagall enterred was the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, according to the book. But in the movie, the teacher was Professor Quirrell. In the book, it was Professor Flitwick teaching. Just thought I'd clear that up. Other than that, great book and great movie."

","Harry Potter came into the public eye in 1997 with the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and quickly became a franchise. Four years later a film adaption was made almost exactly in its image.<br/><br/>One thing I will praise J.K for is the fact that she demanded that the films follow the same story lines as the books. I think that this was a great idea is it would have been impossible to keep the essence of the books intact if Spielberg had had his way and it had been an animated film and set in an American boarding school.<br/><br/>The acting is in a word superb. Each actor and actress portrays their character to the fullest and they all seem to be enjoying themselves as well. For me not a bad choice was made with the casting and each performance is worthy of praise.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also superb. It has probably become one of the most recognisable pieces of music from recent times.<br/><br/>Another thing is the creatures such as fluffy, the three headed dog, and Norbet. For the most part these where good but I do feel a bit iffy about Fluffy's design.<br/><br/>The amount of character development is brilliant.

From what I've just described above, the expectations were high. And it didn't fail to deliver. It's a great movie with pretty good CGI effects(Troll and 2 heads) and it seems they've picked the right actors for the huge job. I didn't find Daniel Radcliffe very effective, though most other characters played their parts well. Richard Harris(Albus Dumbledore) plays his character with particular finesse and charisma. A shame he died during the film of the third film:(RIP). Tom Felton(Draco Malfoy) has done well some sort of Villain.

"kalendra274","10","0","1","24 July 2008"," Magic, entertaining and quite similar to the book
","I've watched this movie a long time ago and I must say, it simply took my breath away. I've read the book and it was as terrific as the movie, it was quite similar to it but it skipped a few bits out such as the ""The Midnight Duel"" and the beginning. But I understand they wanted to make the movie shorter and enjoyable and I certainly have no problem with that. I thought the plot was excellent and it fits in with the book (it's a good thing that they didn't skip a chunk of bits out from the book and made the plot very different from the book - who wants that?) and I must say all the characters from the book was the perfect choice for all the characters in the movie, such as Dumbledore, he looked exactly like the person in the back cover, which of course was Dumbledore. So all the choices for the characters were all incredibly realistic and makes the audience picture them in the book. The performances from the wonderful cast were out-of-this-world! All of them played their role very well and realistically, including Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), and I believe it was his best movie yet! And the special effects used in the movie was, again, incredible! They were used at the right time, in the right place and they looked absolutely tremendous, in other words, REALISTIC! The castle looked incredibly amazing and all of the other settings/costumes etc. were one in a million. The beginning was good, but in my opinion, there should be a story-teller telling the people who haven't read the book what happened in the very beginning of it (introducing the Dursleys, what they do, something strange going on in town and even how Harry's parents died) so that could be an improvement, rather than just cutting to the action at once which makes the people who are not familiar with the book unsure. But they did some fantastic work after that, introducing Harry and how his miserable his life is with the Dursleys and it was very clever what happened in the zoo, making the snake talk to Harry, which that sort of unfolds the secret of him being a wizard so that was great as well. The Letters From Hogwarts were very clever too, but Harry's uncle kept on ripping them up, which makes the audience know that something weird is going on and I must say when the letters flooded the house, I was laughing my head off! And finally Hagrid came to the rescue right on Harry's 11th Birthday! Which makes the audience have a mixture of feelings, scared/wondering who it is at the start and relived that all the secrets his aunt and uncle kept from him is being told, including Harry's a wizard! At the pub everyones staring at Harry and shaking his hand, it makes you feel that you want to be be him too! And that an ordinary boy actually turned out to be a wizard and not get defeated by the the great wizard ""Voldemort"" (a dark wizard who killed Harry's parents but not managed to kill Harry) and also the name was very clever! When Harry met Professor Quirell, we got a completely different thought of him! He is a good guy, who is quite shy and stammers, but secretly he's a villain! Diagon Alley was amazing too, one of the greatest setting from the movie, which gives the thought of it's a place, where of course wizards go to but actually it's a normal alley, full of shops and people! And all the stuff in the shops, makes you want to have it such as owls and the Nimbus 2000! Gringotts was brilliant too, full of goblins doing work and while getting Harry's money, a secret jumps out, something is hidden in a vault but what could it be? Which makes the audience desperate to know the answer and they want to watch more and more, so that is a great way to keep them entertained. Discovering his wand was great, two wands that won't connect to Harry, but strange wand did! Amazing! The Journey To Hogwarts introduces more characters such as, Ron and Hermonie, and that is when their friendship is formed. Hogwarts Castle was remarkable, the makers tried so hard to make a real castle and they eventually did! Then we meet all the other characters and some are Harry enemies such as, Drace and Snape and then we find out Harry has been placed at Gryfindoor House, with all his other friends, so that is a great start to the year! And then we come to the mystery of the stone, which is truly captivating and grabs the audience and that is where the adventure begins and Harry faces new challenges such as Qudditch, fighting with a huge mountain troll and solving the mystery of the stone! So I strongly recommend you rent this movie on DVD/Video turn off the lights, grab the popcorn and get ready for two hours of pure fun and excitement! If you loved the book, you will love this!<br/><br/>RATING : 10/10"
"fed-pe","8","0","1","14 July 2008"," The films and the books
","I think that the film was beautiful: I liked the castle because it was very big and mysterious and the Quiddich matches were very captivating; I liked also Ron because he was very funny. I saw all Harry Potter's films because magic is interesting for me. However I have read ""Harry Potter and the order of the Phoneix"" and ""Harry Potter and the half blood Prince"" and I think that books are better than films because they are are more complete,in fact books contain more details and information about the characters, their physical portrait and personality and about the settings, landscapes and interior of the castle. My favorite characters are the Weasley twin brothers, because they play tricks and they are funny. The end of the film was beautiful in fact Harry defeated Voldemort and the Socerer stone was destroyed so the inventor of the stone had to accept to die. However I wish the Sorcerer stone existed like in this book because if it existed I could live forever too."

","This movie is one of the very interesting and great movie I have ever seen. This story is in a magic school, but we can sympathize their school life, for example classes, friends and love. I think this fact is one of the reason why Harry Potter is liked by all over the world.<br/><br/>And I also like the cast. The main Cast- Harry,Ron,Hermione- plays very good and they are so cute at that time (maybe in 2001?). Now they grow up handsome men and beautiful woman. To compare the first movies Harry Ron and Hermione with the latest Harry Potter series might be one of the way to enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Harry, Ron and Hermione talk the first time in a train is my favorite scene. If you have a chance to watch it, please check this scene."
"rneil95","9","0","1","7 June 2008"," Great Adaptation
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best way to start off the series. The book is filled with wonderful story and great characters. I think that the adaptation of the book was almost exactly the same as the book except for two instances where Neville was either edited out or replaced with Ron. I loved this movie. I remember when it came out, I had a huge fit because I didn't see it on opening day. It was worse for Chamber of Secrets, though. I watched it again, and I noticed it went by much faster than I remembered, but I still think that this movie is a masterpiece. I think that it was cool that they got a movie release so soon after the original novel. I will always love this movie, no matter how flawed it is, although there isn't that many. It's a part of my childhood. Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves, and David Heyman were the dream team of Harry Potter. I loved this movie, flat out loved it."
"jaredcvaughn","7","0","1","2 June 2008"," Nice Start to a Great Series, but Poor Hagrid.
","The movie ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a story of one boy who has a terrible childhood. Harry is treated amazingly poorly by his aunt and uncle, who, despite his being an ""immense burden"", adopted Harry after his mother and father's death. Upon Harry's twelfth birthday his life begins to change; wild unexpected occurrences begin to frazzle Harry's aunt and uncle, but the result of the change is a whole new life of which Harry could not have dreamed.<br/><br/>The movie in my opinion was pretty well done. Visually I think the CGI was great. Some of the action scenes  the ones on broomsticks in particular  were a bit cartoonish, but the overall visual experience was good. I think that the director did a good job of choosing the actors for this film. Dumbledore, the three protagonists, the Weasley twins, etc. were all great. Hagrid's character, on the other hand, was not as great, but I do not think it was the fault of the actor. First, his accent was impeccable. Second, he is visually a true match to Rowling's Hagrid. Where his character fails is in the lines that he was asked to memorize. Simple and repetitive. Rowling gave him many great lines and allowed us to get to know him. Why, script writers, did you not refer to Rowling's book when you asked the question: ""What should Hagrid say?"" In general I thought the writing for the film was OK, but Hagrid's dialogue was at best mediocre.<br/><br/>The flow of the movie was good  it didn't drag at all. I thought overall the director stayed true to the book's plot with the exception of the beginning and the forest scenes with the centaurs. So as I stated above, the movie was pretty good, a nice start to the movie counterpart of a great book series."
"spearchuckerlife","9","0","1","2 June 2008"," Harry Potter was a very good Movie
","""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" became a hit in the year of 1998. The movie was released in 2001. Compared to the book, the movie was OK. The movie may have left out a lot of important parts but it still flowed nicely and it still kept your attention. The acting in the movie was really good. In my opinion, the actors seemed to match the criteria of what I accepted them to be. The movie starts off as a scene of Harry Potter being dropped of on a step because his parents had just been killed. How they died is later revealed in the movie. Harry is forced to live with his mean Aunt and Uncle. He is treated as the outsider of the family. One day Harry gets whisked off to Hogwarts by Hagrid Hogwarts is a magical school for wizard. Harry, not knowing he was magical, was very happy. The movie then takes the audience on a journey with Harry, revealing the dark secrets of his past and other people's around him. He finds him self in tricky situations where is has to use his head and his heart .Good vs. Evil. The plot itself was a good plot and the book and movie easily flowed well. The Special effects were fine they looked real and they looked OK. They were suitable. The script writers should have used more of the book then they did. Even though the movie was good some scenes could have used more dialog from the book and it could've made the scene more worth value but overall the movie was good."
"shangoins","7","0","1","2 June 2008"," Harry Potter is okay.
","In Harry Potter, the main character Harry, is orphaned when his mother and father were supposedly killed in a car accident so he is forced o go live with his aunt and uncle, The Dursleys. Since his aunt and uncle are muggles, normal people, they don't tell him that he is a wizard, because they just want him to be a ""normal"" person. He is soon rescued from his aunt and uncle by Hagrid who is a wizard back at Hogwarts. Harry then learns about his past and is introduced into the world of witches and warlocks.<br/><br/>I liked to movie of Harry Potter a lot more than the book, because in the book they had a lot off unnecessary scenes that they could've done without. I like how in the movie they keep the movie going by not prolonging any of the scenes and making you wait to see what's going to happen. I think that overall in the movie the acting done by the characters was really good. They each played their part well and had the emotion that was needed for each scene to have an effect on the movie and keep it flowing. In the book, Rowling has a brief part where she talks about how Harry's life was growing up and his childhood, but in the movie it wasn't shown at all so that was one part that I think that the directors should've shown. The special effects in my opinion, were really really good because even though you knew that it couldn't be real, it still made you believe that it was. To me, the script writers did a good job in portraying the book without taking out too much or adding unnecessary information."
"anyok6","7","0","1","2 June 2008"," Harry Potter was well written and entertaining but could have used more from the book
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first of J.K. Rowling's magical series. This young protagonist starts out by living the muggle life with his aunt, uncle, and annoyance of a cousin Dudley, knowing very little of his mysterious and mystical past. It was his twelfth birthday when he started to receive letters from Hogwarts, inviting him to spend the next term as a new student of the wizard and witches academy. Hagrid, a wizard friend, comes and retrieves Harry from his horrific living arrangements to take him away. By this point in the 2001 film, director Chris Columbus does a fantastic job of drawing the viewer into the movie, though compared to the book doesn't do quite as fair in introducing Harry's background. Overall, Columbus does a great job in taking Rowling's work and turning it into an animated film, but there are minor differences in the plot that are left out that many might feel should not have been. Included are background, dialogue, and some scenes from the story that did a fantastic job in building a great story. Daniel Radcliff, the actor portraying Potter, makes a wonderful role for the part. He really gives a sense of character and admiration to the heroic role he plays. From his accent to his appearance, he characterizes is the perfect picture from the imagination. Robbie Coltrane, on the other hand, seems to be cheated out of a good part. The 6'1'' actor does a magnificent job portraying the enormous bearded Hagrid. He plays the dim giant very well, and certainly makes one see the Hagrid they imagine, thick accent included; but when it comes to dialog, Hagrid's character in the film is just lack-luster. The novel is perfect in personifying him, while the film leaves out lines and cuts out scenes that help make Hagrid as good as Coltrane could have potentially made him. Overall the acting and casting of the movie was excellently done and there are very few changes that could have been made to make it any better. The special effects in this film were superb. When looking at the time this movie was made, and seeing how realistic the flying and quidditch matches, the magical spells, and even the mystical creatures, it is hard to believe how great they turned out. The lighting in the film was a little dark and bothersome, but when looking at the setting and mysterious feel the film was going for, it is completely acceptable and understandable. The film work was well done. Though it could have used some work, Columbus did a great job in finding the best way to film these witches and wizards. Overall I rate the film a 7 out of 10 for a fun and exciting story, for kids and adults alike. Great acting, dialogue, and filming, and special effects that keeps the action feeling real. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is certainly a film worth watching to any avid science fiction fantasy fan or just a general audience looking for some strange and mischievous fun. The next of the series is also something to look out for in the future!"
"vip_ebriega","10","0","1","19 May 2008"," The magic begins!
","My Take: It's every bit a new pop-culture classic. An astounding, magical adventure. <br/><br/>Unless you've been living under a rock all your life, you'll know that J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" book series is the biggest thing in the fantasy genre since George Lucas dominated it with STAR WARS. I myself have taken fancy of it, and since I'm a teenager and a big fan of the world Rowling has created, I deeply understand the hype behind it all. The series is very creative with its neat ideas and unique storytelling. The movies, since they were immensely faithful to their source, are just as creative. The series reminded me of the worlds in STAR WARS, since this one takes us away from the bounds of an expensive big-screen movie and transports us to a world unlike reality.<br/><br/>I haven't fully read the first novel THE SORCERER'S STONE, which also became the first of many more adaptations of Rowling's other novels. I only read one so far, and it was THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, which would also later be adapted to the screen, and also my favorite of the bunch so far. Even if you haven't read the novel, the movie is a dazzling array of magical images and stylish storytelling. The surprises and twists aren't all that special, but what is special is what's important. This big-screen adaptation is filled with the best kind of special effects George Lucas' ILM effects house has to offer. It's an eye-feast of spellbinding proportions.<br/><br/>I really don't need to dictate what the film is about. If you've been living under a rock and you don't know what it's about, I suggest you just read the book instead. Its deliverance from the book to the movie is not much different. But that's all right, the acting and production values are par excellence. The acting by a veteran cast are terrific, but its the younger cast players that dazzle more. The acting skills of a then-young Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson (who have then grown into the roles) are terrific, with Watson being the best (her Ms. Know-it-all impression is a stand-out). Supporting performances are provided by a line of ""who's who"" like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and a few others including a host of top British talents that would soon be a staple in the series along with its special effects and astounding sets.<br/><br/>I don't have to say this, but here it goes, HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERER'S STONE is magical. <br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."
"billpollock183","8","0","1","15 May 2008"," Sorcerer's Stone??
","Great movie from quite a reasonable book, but why on earth did they have to change the title from ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" to the Sorcerer's Stone. Surely it couldn't be that they felt those in the good old US of A couldn't understand what the correct title meant and had to change the title so it could be understood. It should be noted that there is a fair bit of a difference between a sorcerer and a philosopher so in using the correct title there should not have been any confusion about the meaning of the title. The changing of the title is somewhat akin to the in of putting subtitles in the Crocodile Dundee movie."
"dobbin-4","7","0","1","29 February 2008"," Great adaption of the book, apart from some horrible acting performances it really holds up.
","Now, there was an extremely high amount of hype about the Harry Potter movies when they announced they were going to make it in to a movie and Fans all around the world were hoping that unlike most screen adapted books that they would keep the magic of the book inside. Now, when I saw it, I was more relieved then anything, I went in expecting the worst out of it and it was only really watching it on DVD for the first time that I realized that it really was a great movie and apart from a horrible habit of overacting on Hermoines (Forgive Speeling)part it was held together excellently. Another thing, Daniel Radcliffe did one of the best child actors performances ever as he was Harry Potter, he was not the actor playing Harry Potter but he was actually Harry Potter. I also think the actor playing Ron (Ruprint Grint) is an excellent addition to the class and does well as Harry's sidekick during the film. I think all fans of the Harry Potter books will love this film and the many sequels that followed and even though the acting skills of Hermoine had not yet developed, they got there. I rate this film 73%. GO HARRY POTTER."

","I saw this movie first before reading the books and walked away very impressed. The sheer imagination that came with this movie amazed me the story is wonderfully written a kids movie that does not dumb itself down to it's audience. Daniel Radcliffe's acting is a little stiff a little wooden but not overly all considering the fact that he was not a acting expert when he started he manages to do very well. Richard Harris THE man who was born to be Dumbledore I can't imagine anyone else in this role even his eventual replacement in the prisoner of azkaban does not measure up to him. And Robbie Coltrane the heart of the series his Hagrid is a joy to watch as is Emma Watson who is outstanding as Herimone Granger. This movie is a treat and deserves to be watched again and again and in years to come I'm sure it'll be labeled a Classic."

I adore all of the books, and no while I didn't wait on a line all night to get a copy of the last book, the moment that the local K-Mart opened, I rushed in and grabbed a copy. That said I obviously have high standards for the movies and this one definitely met my standards.<br/><br/>The whole film had a very magical feel to it. Hogwarts looked gorgeous, the Quidditch pitch, the grounds, the classrooms, not to mention the Great Hall looked stunning. Just like I pictured it all to look in the book.<br/><br/>The casting was perfect too. Richard Harris (R.I.P) made an excellent Dumbledore and Maggie Smith was great as McGonagall. The Dursleys were well cast and Snape was played well by Alan Rickman. Hagrid too looked just as I imagined him to look.<br/><br/>Not to mention the kids. Daniel Radcliffe looked so cute as eleven-year-old Harry Potter and Emma Watson and Rupert Grint made the perfect Ron and Hermione. Tom Felton did well as Draco as did Matthew Lewis as Neville.<br/><br/>The story line in itself was also well done. Not a thing was left out that needed to be there and I could easily follow along without having to recheck the book.<br/><br/>Though the rest of the films went downhill, it at least started off well. Nine out of ten stars!"

","I found director Chris Columbus's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to be a wonderful and thrilling interpretation of J.K. Rowlings novel. With the understanding that this famous film was just one way to visualize the events of the book, it seemed to reach the general fan's imagination. It kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what the next magical move or spellbound adventure would come along. Not everything appeared as it did in my imagination but that's okay because Mr. Columbus was just using his. I do have a small complaint however I thought Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry Potter was a bit lacking. His character's dialogue was not very impactful; he appeared to be the shy boy that every high school has. On the contrary, I came to the conclusion that Emma Watson's character; Hermione was a bit more likable than Rowling's. She appeared more as a slightly troubled girl as opposed to a mean brat. In the end, Rupert Grint's performance as Ron Weasley was the most memorable. With his quick thinking and cunning one-liners, he seemed to overshadow the mind of Potter. Even if this movie wasn't what you pictured while reading the novel, it was a remarkable view of a fan that is just as enthusiastic. This movie has something that everyone can enjoy, humor, life lessons, intriguing characters, and edge of the seat plot line. I actually saw the film before I read the novel and I discovered that to be a fun twist compared to reading the novel first. But which ever you do, you will be sure to have a fun filled adventure with the delightful cast."

","Warner Brother's depiction of Harry potter and the Sorcerer's stone passes the test! As anticipation built up for its debut in theatres, J.K Rowling's brilliant series was about to be loved by more than just its loyal readers. Now, everything entertaining and enjoyable about Harry Potter is accessible to viewers too. Eager fans and intrigued new ones all flooded movie theatres to get in on the new buzz! There were several scenes from the original book left out, but I wouldn't hold that against the producers as it probably conflicted with time issues. Either way, I thought the movie was a nice visual tribute to the book, despite the forever-present argument that movies don't do books must justice. After all, the fact that every kid in America knows who Harry Potter is is a true testament to its success. One thing in particular that I was highly fond of was the legitimacy of the characters emotions. For how fairy-tale like the story is, the movie did a really good job at avoiding cheesy lines accompanied by bad acting. In fact, the acting was so good I could make a real connection to the character's feelings. This movie is definitely worth seeing, 10 out of 10."

","Every so often a tale comes along, that not only rips the audience from reality but bewitches the imagination and keeps us crawling back for more. A phenomenon that could be no other than the ""Harry Potter"" series filled to the brim with entrancing worlds and amiable characters. Rarely among the majority of most films does the story unfold so beautifully onto the big screen. Rowling is a master of making believe-able characters in a make-believe environment and so is the movie's director; Chris Columbus as far the casting goes. Daniel Radcliffe, as the great Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Harry's loyal friend, Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson, Hermione Granger. Each plays an uncanny duplicate of the books persona making the film almost parallel from imagination to film. Rowling's story of mystics and magic takes the viewer and shakes them out of the mundane comatose of everyday life. As she, leads the audience to an escape (lasting shyly over two hours) to a fantastic visual world that delights those of all ages. I highly recommend this movie to any ""Harry Potter"" fan. Even if you aren't a fan one watch and you will be two."
"rn_light_under_darkness","8","0","1","19 November 2007"," Best Harry Potter movie to date.
","Being a fan of the harry potter book series I have to say that this is one of the better films to watch, it's the one that is the closest to the books. While the acting of younger generation leaves a little to be desired, they found an experienced adult cast. The most memorable actor-to-character would have to be Dumbledore. He was, by far, the best choice for his character, playing out the important scenes as only Dumbledore would, with quiet enthusiasm he more or less brings this film to a peak. Director Chris Columbus did a fantastic job on this one, with not a hair out of place, so to speak. He kept to the books, as far as one can when going from book to movie. I personally was sad to see him go in the third installment of this movie line. The landscapes are believable, the special effects were up to date, and the cast was memorable. The only reason I gave this an 8 out of 10 was because of some of the more obvious mistakes, Harrys scar switching sides, Dudly Dursleys hair was not blonde as it was in the books, some things were left out that wouldn't have added any time onto the final outcome of the movie. Obviously they can't add all of the aspects that the book brings to life but they could have tried a little harder, I mean c'mon, Lord of the rings was only 400 pages long and it was around 3 hours long, why couldn't they have taken the 300 or so pages and let it go on a little longer. All in all this movie is one of the best of 2001, I would recommend it to everybody, Harry Potter book fans or not."

The magic and atmosphere that was presented in this film blew my mind away. Seeing the magic for the first time was awesome. In the other films you kind of expect the magic that would be coming but because this is the very first movie, it was fun and entertaining to see the magic performed for the first time.

Speaking of school, when I went to see the movie someone at the theater was taken out of school to see this movie by his mother! She went and got him from school and went to see the movie. How cool is that! The movie stuck surprisingly close to the original story. I remember reading the book before going into the theater on opening day. Their were a few things that were different but they were so minor that I didn't notice. Everybody was perfect in their roles. Alan Rickman was simply dripping evil as Severus Snape.

And the acting is stellar from veterans Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, and Richard Harris (when comparing his Dumbledore to Michael Gambon's it would have been fascinating to see both actors tackle the character at all stages in the series to see how their interpretations would develop; sadly Harris died after film two, necessitating a cast change).<br/><br/>Not as stunning as LOTR, nevertheless there is plenty in the first Harry Potter to interest adults and delight children."

"Pilsung89","9","0","1","16 August 2007"," Great start to a wonderful series
","For years I refused to watch the Harry Potter movies, thinking that I would not like the idea of young witches and wizards. However, after seeing this first movie I immediately came to love the series. Even though it's a PG/PG-13 series, it's terrific. I have seen all the Harry Potter movies out so far, and The Sorceror's Stone is a terrific beginning to the series.<br/><br/>The acting and the atmosphere here is amazing. The whole cast does a wonderful job, and it looks surprisingly realistic for a magic movie. Daniel Radcliffe does a good job as Harry Potter, changing his character as is appropriate throughout the movie. Rupert Grint is good, not to mention hilarious, as Potter's best friend, Ron Weasley. Personally I love Emma Watson's performance as the bossy, clever, book-loving Hermione Granger the best. She doesn't portray Hermione as a complete bossy jerk, but more of a insecure girl who loves to prove herself, and deep down has good intentions and a good heart. Other notable performances are Maggie Smith as professor McGonnagell and Alan Rickman as the somewhat scary, dark professor Snape.<br/><br/>I really love how this movie starts off the series. Since it's about young kids learning magic at a school, I didn't know what to expect. The kids did not just sit and learn about philosophy, but they do not turn out to be automatic experts, either. Too often in series people just learning something quickly and suddenly know everything there is to know. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are like average first-year students, each showing particular strengths in different subjects. There is some good action in the movie: trolls attacking the school, sports involving flying on a broomstick, and a few good spells.<br/><br/>For those who don't know. Harry Potter is an average kid living with his mean, abusive aunt and uncle when he is enrolled in Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. His aunt and uncle disapprove of magic, so he is rescued by Hagrid, keeper of Hogwarts. At Hogwarts he befriends two other students, Ron and Hermione. Throughout the movie Harry discovers what really happened to his parents, what it's like to have friends, and what courage is. At the same time he develops a feud with a cocky first-year student, Malfoy, and tries to keep the school safe from an evil he feels only he, Ron, and Hermione understand. <br/><br/>Harry and Ron are close friends from the start of the year at Hogwarts, because they talk on the train. Hermione does not immediately jump in. Overtime she is drawn to them more and wants to be with them more.<br/><br/>Get this movie if you can, because it's awesome. I give it a 9/10. I give it only a nine because it still has some of the rough spots natural to first installment: Confusion, lot's of time spent explaining things, less action.

As such, the first Potter film is all bright colors and an earnest desire to be faithful to Rowling's written words. Despite Columbus's unimaginative translation, it is amazing how well Rowling's universe suits the screen, with dazzlingly visual inventions like the great hall, pivoting stair-cases and the quidditch match.<br/><br/>The story breezes past and the young actors deliver embody their characters with satisfactory conviction, no more, no less. Daniel Radcliff (Harry) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) are the fortunate standouts. Overall, the film bodes well for the rest of the series."

It is curious that you should be destined for this wand... when its brother gave you that scar. Harry: And who owned that wand? Mr. Ollivander: We do not speak his name!

All the children do wonderful jobs as the characters, although there were a few scenes which they seemed off, i can let this slide as they are only young. The special effects were good, especially the quidditch scene. There were a few odd shots, where the CGI looked a bit like a video game. This is mainly the troll scene, where it suffers poorly.

","I never read the Harry Potter book series but I have watched the four movies, and I still plan to watch the others. But I would like to review this one. This is one out of the two films that Richard Harris played Albus Dumbledore.<br/><br/>Harry Potter just turned eleven years old and he is receiving letters stating that he has been accepted to Hogwarts, but Uncle Vernon keeps burning them, and throwing them away. Harry is also having owls around his house during the day which is quite odd because they usually wonder around at night. At one point Uncle Vernon gets so sick that he closes the mailbox shoot, or whatever you call it so no mail can come in. Suddenly, hundreds and thousands of letters accepting Harry to the school comes flying in through the chimney and the mailshoot. Harry grabs one and attempts to run to his room but Uncle Vernon grabs him and stops him from reading the letter. Uncle Vernon decides to move far away where no one can mail him.<br/><br/>He decides to go to a small island in a small house while Harry Potter sleeps on the cold, hard cement floors with a cover writing ""Happy Birthday Harry"" with his fingers on the sand. He says, ""Makes a Wish, Harry"" and blows. Suddenly, a large man you will know as Hagrid barges in looking for Harry. He finds Harry, at first he thought Dudley was Harry but then he found out Harry was Harry. He is sent somewhere to shop for items and an owl and wand.<br/><br/>There begins the adventure for Harry Potter. The rest is for you to find out.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for if you had read book one of Harry Potter, or if you just want to see it."

","I came to these movies totally oblivious to the books. I have not read a page of any of the novels. With that, my critique of these films is purely on the cinema. I had not previously added my thoughts on the whole series to this point, but with the addition of my thoughts on Order of the Phoenix, I figure it is time I got caught up.<br/><br/>I absolutely enjoyed this movie. I had heard all the clam-mering about Potter being a film and all the fans being pumped up, but as aforementioned, I had not read them, just know the basic outline. I thought Columbus captured a great sense of wonder and ""magic"" with the film. All of the leads were perfectly cast and Columbus set the stage for the series and no matter your opinion of him, have to give credit where credit is due on those two facts.<br/><br/>My only complaint about the movie was the end, which kind of was a little anti-climatic, all in all though, everything with this film from the costumes, set designs and casting were spot on. But the biggest contributor, as is the case with many film he scores, William's score raises this film from being a really good film, to a great one. John Williams is an absolute genius when it comes to finding the right themes for characters. His music adds the perfect touch to all that is going on.<br/><br/>This is the lowest rated film of the franchise out here on IMDb, but for someone seeing these oblivious to the books, this was a great start for the franchise and still remains my favorite of the franchise so far."

At the end, the chess battle was amazing. When Quirrel was revealed to be Voldemort, I got shivers! Emma Watson was very a good choice. Robbie Coltrane was a PERFECT Hagrid.

","Although the first installment of the Harry Potter series falls slightly short of the all-encompassing magical experience it had hoped to be, one must admit it did come pretty close to a total triumph. Based on the insanely popular children novels from author J.K. Rowling, viewers are entertainingly introduced to the enchanted world of young witchcraft and wizardry which had captivated an inordinate number of readers. 30 minutes into the expensive film and it is completely clear why.<br/><br/>Rowling has crafted an exquisitely, conceptually rich fantasy world which manages to combine many darker, reality-based themes and deal with them through the wondrous world of Hogwarts. It is in this immensely beguiling school a majority of the entire franchise will take place, and it is easy to see why. A new vernacular with which Rowling describes her alternate universe seemed to have resonated with many more people then expected, and in this satisfying introduction director Chris Columbus wastes hardly any time getting into the fun of it all. Not since the mid 80's have we seen such a lovingly detailed homage to children's fantasies, labored over in such a way that would make any hardened fan of the genre blush.<br/><br/>Brought to life by a great cast, many experienced actors playing professors of the magic school only make these young trio of children, whom we will come to watch mature, that much more engaging. Daniel Radcliffe may have been a little over his head with this first installment, arguably overshadowed by his two co-conspirators. He nevertheless accomplishes the task of portraying the iconic shy boy wizard with a little directional and a whole lot of conceptual help, ushering in one of the more lucrative franchises of modern days."

The thing that makes this movie so endearing is that there is the magic found in the books, the magic when Harry first found out he was a wizard and the excitement of a whole new world. The children are adorable, and Hogwarts and the wizarding world are depicted beautifully. The music also fits Harry Potter perfectly.<br/><br/>After this movie, the movies spin off in many different directions, and much of the original magic is lost.

","Speaking as someone who has seen this movie over 200 times (no joke, people), I must say that there are a few flaws, as is the case with many a film. It is extremely rare this day and age to find a seamless film, and lets face it, with a main character that boasts only two pre-Sorcerer's Stone credentials, and neither of those happen to be one of my top 200 picks for a Friday night flick and a director who boasts such films as Bicentennial Man and Monkeybone, I think it's safe to say that most of the weight of this film rests on the shoulders of Chris Columbus and not David Radcliffe. And I must also admit that for an actor's second film and third acting job, he did above and beyond what I would expect of a nearly new actor, fresh on the market.<br/><br/>Enough of the banter, let's move on. First and foremost, I have to say that this is my favorite book-to-film port to date, and it doesn't look like that's going to sway anytime soon. The Sorcerer's Stone does it's job, captures the innocence of the first installment of the Harry Potter series, and really is a great film, which is more than I can say for the following films, which would have been right up there with this film, had they not been book adaptations. As I have said many times, I wish I would not have read the books so that my opinion is not swayed by sitting there watching and comparing to the book, but the damage has been done. This film has only a few flaws, but then again, it's hard to find films that are seamless in this day and age, so I won't hold those against it, but I think it would be fair to warn you. Most lines in the film seem too practiced, too refined, as though the actor/ess is reading off of a cue card. There are many scenes where lines that should have been cool were just lame, and the CG, which was great for 2001, is less than impressive today. Apart from that, great film, definite ""re-watch value"", a major recommend."

But I look at the movie now, and I must say, although there are a number of flaws, the movie adaptation of the novel brings out the true spirit of Harry Potter that JK Rowling intended.<br/><br/>The movie basically walked off the pages for me, and every character was as I pictured them to be. First things first- the acting. Richard Harris was, and still remains to this day, the greatest Dumbledore I have ever seen. Micheal Gambton, although good, cannot match the perfection that Richard Harris achieved when he played his character as Dumbledore.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, although new to movies, still did an excellent job, and played his part well. Indeed, his character really was what I visualized. All the way down from how he talks to how he walks, still gets me as to how good of an actor Daniel Radcliffe is.<br/><br/>Emma Watson, my personal favorite actress up to date, definitely perfected her character as Hermione. Bossy, know it all Hermione... and she did an amazing job at it... I love the line, ""I'm going to bed before you two get us killed, or worse- expelled.""<br/><br/>Rupert Grint was EXACTLY how I imagined him to be, and he also played his part very well, I really believed he was the poor, red-haired Ron Weasley from the novel!<br/><br/>Tom Felton, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (awsome Hagrid) and the rest of the cast all did and excellent job of what they did. <br/><br/>Although I really wanted to see Peeves the Poltergeist and Professor Binns, Chris Columbus made the movie worthwhile, and I congratulate him on his work.<br/><br/>The only cons I can think of right at the moment is how McGonnagal really didn't seem upset at the beginning when she learned of the Potter parents being murdered. And, perhaps, how Malfoy wasn't shown as the cruel rich, snobby boy that the book portrayed him as.<br/><br/>Other than that though, Chris Columbus stuck to the book and because of that, the Harry Potter series has received more praise than any other book- movie series... besides, perhaps Lord of the Rings. <br/><br/>Well done,<br/><br/>and I would recommend this movie to anyone."

It was for all of people who love magics. But, there were some problems. The worst thing was Voldmort's face.

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first movie in the Harry Potter series. Harry Potter, for those who have been living under a rock for ten years, is a highly successful series of novels for children. The protagonist, Harry, is a neglected eleven-year-old schoolboy in England who learns he is not a regular boy at all. In fact Harry Potter is a wizard. As if that wasn't shocking enough to learn on your eleventh birthday, Harry also discovers that he is not alone, there is a large hidden community of wizardry and magic that Harry will come to live in. <br/><br/>The movie series created out of the novels, gives a visual touch to the bestselling books. Children who imagined what Harry's world looked like are given a stunning digital image of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Children have reacted to the Harry Potter series much like the children of the late seventies to early eighties reacted to Star Wars. Star Wars created a whole universe of aliens and spacecraft, which turned into a billion dollar empire of merchandise and licensing rights. Children fell in love with the Star Wars characters; toys and any other merchandise from that series were astonishingly successful. <br/><br/>Just as Star Wars was its own universe of marketability, so is the young wizard's Harry Potter's world. Harry lives in England, but attends a secret wizardry school. He requires a magic wand, a robe, a cauldron, magic potions, a flying broom, and many schoolbooks. Not surprisingly, children in the real world can find all of these items as toys in their local toy store, without the magical powers of course. But just because Harry Potter is marketable is not why he is successful.<br/><br/>Harry Potter's story speaks to the fantasies of all little children, He comes from a seemingly horrendous lifestyle to find out he is famous and powerful. Harry's parents died when he was an infant, his aunt and uncle raised him. They neglected him and only focused on their son Dudley, who was an overweight bully who only gained entertainment from torturing Harry. Harry was forced to live in a closet under the stairs. Harry was very alone. However, Harry soon gets what every child wants, after he discovers the truth of his past, he learns he is actually rich but didn't know it, and he attends school and finds friends and a group of people who love him. <br/><br/>The movie has many lessons for young children. It preaches equality, acceptance, hard work, and stresses the importance of family. Harry must constantly study for his classes, which get increasingly harder. He befriends a boy who is from a large poor Irish wizard family, Ron Weasley, even though the rest of the community seems to mock the Weasley family. He also befriends a nerdy, brainy girl, Hermione Granger. But the biggest social moral running through the entire series is that of accepting others who maybe different. <br/><br/>The wizarding world is locked in a hot debate over the education of witches and wizards. Magic skills are passed down from generation to generation, Harry's parents where very famous wizards who were murdered. Some witches and wizards are not the offspring of other magic folk. The magical children of wizards are described as ""pureblooded"". Many in the wizarding world wish to discriminate against those of who are not pure blood. They are referred to as ""mudbloods"", a derogatory term. Harry finds himself defending the ""mudblood"" children, namely his friend Hermione. <br/><br/>Harry Potter does not only appeal to one gender. Even though the main character is a boy, it has been found that girls enjoy the series just as much if not more than boys. The issues Harry faces are universal to childhood. He longs for friendship and family and gets all of his wishes. A pure fantasy for many children, which is why they are so attracted to it. Harry defeats the bully; he becomes successful at sports, battles evil, and becomes a popular hero among his peers. <br/><br/>Harry Potter is also a classic fantasy for children. Harry Potter is destined to battle the most evil wizard who ever lived; Lord Voldemort. Voldemort is responsible for the death of Harry's parents, and the deaths of many other good witches and wizards. Like with many children's films and stories, good and evil are clearly defined. Children can clearly rout for good to triumph evil. <br/><br/>The film is not without its critics. Some in the Christian community do not like the series because to seems to promote an anti-Christian life-style. Some Christians object to teaching children about fantasy magic, paganism, and a society that does not worship Jesus. Even though in the movie the characters all celebrate Christmas. <br/><br/>Overall I give the film an A-; there is not much in this film to be fearful of from the perspective of a parent. There is some fantasy violence, limited to magic beams emanating from wands. Children, can reenact the events in the film without any harm to anyone. The movie encourages children to work hard, play sports, and fight for equality. Children obviously love this series as it has been turned into a huge market empire. I would recommend it myself for anyone with children."

","Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) life as a famous wizard begins at age eleven, when rescued from the horrible Dursleys by Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane),""Keeper of the Keys at Hogwarts."" Adventures and life changing encounters are bountiful as Harry moves from a life as a prisoner to become a celebrity. Rescued from the outrageous neglect of his aunt (Fiona Shaw) and uncle (Richard Bremmer), Harry, as a young boy with a great destiny, proves his worth while attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br/><br/>Flying brooms, wands, evil potions, and invisible cloaks are all part of a world that is soon to be introduced to Harry Potter. This movie sparks the imagination of a wonderful, mystical world in which good triumphs over evil. Harry Potter begins his life as a deprived and socially inept young man. These personality traits are due to the cruel treatment endured while living with his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling). Unexplainable events occur such as the intriguing conversation and surprising release of the boa constrictor at the zoo. Harry is as startled by this occurrence as everybody else. Although he doesn't understand why these incidents occur, he takes them in stride and suffers through the punishments doled out. Harry's character is changed when he receives the invitation to attend Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is with this invitation that Harry's character begins to transform. Hidden secrets and family skeletons are revealed to Harry when he accepts this invitation. By entering this new world, Harry grows financially, socially, and intellectually. There are two main settings that make a lasting impression: Diagon Alley is the first of the two, where Harry goes to purchase necessary school supplies for Hogwarts. When entering an establishment, he is recognized and readily greeted like a war hero arriving home. Diagon Alley is an open market for any potion or ingredient a witch or a wizard could want. In the many shops, owls are displayed much like puppies at a pet store; children longingly stare at ""the new Nimbus Two Thousand"" broomsticks. It is during this stop that Harry realizes the enormity of his situation. The next setting that teases the imagination is Hogwarts, perched atop a high mountain, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, a huge castle. But within Hogwarts staircases shift with no notice, ghosts roam the hallways, food magically appears on tables, and portraits converse with passersby. This puzzling maze of corridors and hallways that make up Hogwarts entice the reader to explore the many passageways of Hogwarts in their imaginations. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" tells the story of an orphaned boy who learns on his eleventh birthday that he possesses magical powers. Also he learns Voldemort (Richard Bremmer) killed his parents instead of them dying in a car crash. After ten years of living under the stairs, he's suddenly among people who share his peculiar gifts at Hogwarts. But the real journey is Harry's growing up adventures, in which he encounters people who need his help against the forces of evil, and his effort to live up to his father's name."
"PeterJordan","7","0","1","9 August 2006"," But is it as good as the book?
","Of course like all paper to celluloid projects this movie was inevitably going to pose the question ""but is it as good as the book?"" but with JK Rowling firmly in control and overseeing the film production it was to be expected that she would push for authenticity in any case. It is still likely, however, that many die-hard Harry in print fans who have their own image of how it should have been will still say ""not near as good as the book"". But that is possibly more so a reflection on the delights of reading and how the imagination can conjure up an image in ones mind as opposed to being a criticism of the film.<br/><br/>Inevitably of course elements of the book had to be sacrificed for brevity to make a movie that could retain the attention span of children - and even still it comes in at a considerable 2 hrs and 32 minutes. It still does manage to convey the core parts of the book admirably though and indeed it is said that, such were they complexities of aspects of the plot and location, it would have been very difficult to do just credit to the book without the advances in digital editing of the past five years. In that context Harry's School of Wizardry, Hogwarts, is portrayed exactly how you imagine it should be and even the Wizarding Game of Quidditch, which is basically like an airborne cross between seven a side soccer and basketball played on broomsticks with four balls, is portrayed quite well, though this is possibly one area where an over-dependence on special effects and high action (excuse the pun!) didn't exactly equate with what I had conjured up in my own head from the book. The casting is also rather inspired. Daniel Radcliffe quite simply IS Harry Potter. Richard Harris, as Headmaster Dumbledore, sports a beard even wilder looking than as the Bull McCabe if that is possible. Robbie Coltrane is excellent as the unkempt giant caretaker of Hogwarts; Hagrid and it seemed almost inevitable than no one but Alan Rickman at his super evil best could play Professor Snape, Harry's nemeses at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>And so for those rareities who have never heard of Harry Potter  What of the plot? Basically young Harry Potter is something of a prodigious celebrity amongst Wizarding folk for surviving an attack from ""You know who"", otherwise known as, but seldom called the arch evil dark Wizard, Lord Maldevort, who killed both his parents when he was only one year old. Afterwards Harry is doomed to live with his very nasty muggle (Wizarding Folk Terminology for non wizards) aunt and uncle and cousin for the following ten years, knowing nothing about his wizardry, until he is finally rescued by Hagrid on his eleventh birthday and brought to Hogwarts school of Wizardry to begin to learn his trade. The film thereafter basically follows the adventures of Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger during their first year in Hogwarts.<br/><br/>And so to the verdict? I found it a highly entertaining and quite inspired adaptation of the book; admittedly with some flaws, but I'd still grant it 7/10."
"loubna","7","0","1","5 August 2006"," Harry Potter and the Philosphers stone
","I think Harry Potter and the Philosphers stone was a great movie. It might have missed a few things from the book but it was really good to see all the characters that we would see over the past years until the end of Harry Potter. I myself think that the movie needed a bit more things in it. Like Harry thinking all of it was a dream and how he thought that he didn't belong at Hogwarts and they also should have said more about Harry's scar and his eyes, due to the fact that J.K. Rowling has hinted that Harry's eyes might help him defeat Voldemort. But all in all it was a great movie and I say a job well done to Mr. Chris Columbus for giving us an excellent start to the Harry Potter movies."
"katemallon","9","0","1","26 July 2006"," Great Movie for the whole family
","Wands at the ready! Daniel Radcliffe takes up the role of mysterious boy wizard Harry Potter from J.K. Rowling's epic seven part fantasy series. Fans of all ages have been going crazy ever since they heard that Rowling's popular series was going to be transfigured, so to speak, into a film to be showed on movie screens around the world. Yet what makes this movie so unique is that it was not derived from a modern video game or television series, that the younger generation seems to enjoy, but from an ancient form of entertainment. A book! Just what is the magic that is held within those pages, that seemed to have hooked readers into its compelling storyline around the world? Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is filled with plenty of excitement. The screenplay is wonderfully interpreted from Rowling's complex storyline that introduces the Harry Potter realm; actors and actresses portray believable, memorable characters, and every scene is filled spectacular special effects. I find it only fair that this movie is truly a piece of magic itself.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first in a compelling seven-story adventure where one night living with his aunt and uncle in a somewhat abused life, eleven-year-old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) learns that he is a wizard and gets shipped off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn the art of magic. At his arrival he befriends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and the insufferable know it all Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and of course there's the deadly enemy the main character always makes, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Harry Potter is brought about many trials and cloisters in learning the art of magic with his many teachers like Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and ""greasy git"" Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), all while being praised highly by the greatest wizard in the world, Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and taken under the large wing of the half-giant gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). What makes this story more compelling is that Harry Potter himself is a hero, a hero for defeating a dark wizard by the name of Lord Voldemort (craftily done by computer generation). Now Lord Voldemort is after a precious stone that will make him immortal, and Harry and his friends are the only ones who can stop him.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, is filled with action packed scenes that have been digitally enhanced with the wonders of technology from a three-headed dog to a miniature dragon. Some of the best scenes include the Quidditch scene where Harry partakes in his first Quidditch match, the devil's snare scene where Harry, Ron and Hermione find themselves being choked by a plant, and finally the troll scene where Harry and Ron save Hermione from a ghastly looking, mold covered troll. These digital enhancements polish the gems of the movie perfectly and make them shine with outstanding brightness, for they really give the movie that magical aspect.<br/><br/>The setting is also another strong point found within the movie. Most of the places match the ones described in the book perfectly. They create such a vivid image in the mind, that it almost makes you think that it what you are seeing is real. The Hogwarts castle is depicted almost perfectly with it's towering roofs and warmly lit windows. The corridors are lit with torches and floating candles while the potions classroom looks dark and grimy. The grounds are beautiful, flourishing with a spring of magic. Every aspect was craftily done to make the movie as real to the book as possible.<br/><br/>The movie also has some shortcomings as well. For it being two and a half hours long, you figure they'd put the important parts in. However, this is not the case. Most of the time, the important parts that lead to the next event were cut out and rearranged to make the story better for a movie audience. In other aspects of the film, Harry is portrayed unrealistically as a boy wizard who defeated a dark lord at the age of six months is now the greatest wizard of all time? From the moment Harry enters Hogwarts he becomes a hero even though he didn't do anything. For most of Harry's life he didn't even know of his great feat against the dark lord, and within days at Hogwarts he is flaunting his unique lightning bolt scar like he knew that one day he would become a hero. He then takes on the responsibility of saving the entire school from dark powers without question. I'd expect that an eleven-year-old boy would be scared just like every other young kid who was threatened with death.<br/><br/>Even though the movie had both very strong points and it's shortcomings, it was still overall a great film. As the first of an epic seven part series, this movie ends with a happy ending, but a lot of questions unanswered. There can be both a good and bad side to this. Many fans can't stand the waiting for the next film to be produced in a year or so, but if you get them hooked enough, you can guarantee that they'll be back for the next one. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a movie made for family viewing. It depicts the life of a wizard and how he copes with being in a new world. It also firmly implies on the important lessons in courage and loyalty to those you care for.<br/><br/>As of now, there are total of six books and four Harry Potter movies, all of which have hit record amounts. Fans of J.K. Rowling's masterpiece are anxiously awaiting the closure of her series with the final book. I suggest until that happens, fans can occupy themselves with watching the magic of the Harry Potter films and the majestic moral themes they present."
"csiwesley","9","0","2","18 July 2006"," A review of the entire series
","Well I've not really read any of the books besides the first one and I must say that the transition from text to full visual splendor is truly amazing and looks very very accurate. Add a top rate cast and a top rated director to the cauldron and you get a very very entertaining and wonderful series. The first movie was excellent. The second one was darker, scarier and even better than the first. The third one was the worst of the lot, mostly attributable to bad direction, overdownsizing of the story and some degradation in acting. The fourth one is not as good as the first two but improves a bit over the third one. All four movies are worth watching at least once though. They are all really good."
"etsm92","10","0","1","4 July 2006"," Wonderful imagination and just like the first book! But they don't include Peeves...
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone/2001/****<br/><br/>Main Stars: Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint<br/><br/>Okay, so this is the starting film, the very first film of the seven-part series of HARRY POTTER! What a wonderful, charming, and imaginative book and movie! I was extremely entertained with the book after I saw the movie. I was only in third grade when the movie came out so I was not the best at reading nor the most convinced of reading. I have read all of the books and I say I am very impressed with all of them; however, I also am safe to say some were better than others. I'm totally interested in the whole series and many readers can't wait until the seventh book of the seven-part series comes out and neither can I Well I can wait because I have other books to read but I will, when the seventh book comes out, start reading immediately because the sixth book actually leads into the seventh which makes you hang on for a long time. But before the seventh book and movie and the prequels before that happen, the world lay at the mercy of the young 11 year old Harry Potter having to face the mystery of the Sorcerer's Stone in his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He becomes Hogwarts's newest celebrity on the very first day when everyone whispers in gob smacked voices, ""Harry Potter!"" Harry Potter, as clueless as he is since he lives with the foul, evil Muggle Dursleys', doesn't know he's a wizard until the keeper of the keys, Hagrid, tells him. And the most expected scene would be Harry getting his letter which is inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and to become a very complex wizard in his seven years of learning; progressing toward the end until finally BEcoming one of the best, smartest, cleverest wizards to ever live. Ever since Lord Voldemort gave Harry Potter that scar on his forehead Harry has become famous throughout the wizard world. In the Muggle world, however, everyone could careless about him as though he's some regular pedestrian on the sidewalk with a normal and dull life. Yet in the wizard world everyone shouts enthusiastically, ""HARRY POTTER! WE MEET AT LAST! YOU LOOK JUST LIKE YOUR PARENTS DID. YOU LOOK JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER BUT YOU HAVE YOUR MOTHER'S EYES! YOU LOOK JUST LIKE I DREAMED YOU WOULD!"" Then they bow down to Harry like he's there ruler, their lord and so on and so forth So this so-called Sorcerer's Stone is a secret, very secret stone and it's all Hogwarts's business according to Dumbledore and Hagrid. Yet later in the magnificent film, the stone becomes Harry's, Ron's, and Hermione's quest to find the secret of it. Nicolas Flamel has something to do with it and Nicolas is a friend of Dumbledore and Dumbledore himself wouldn't dare give out valuable information regarding the Sorcerer's Stone. What exactly is it? Oh come on Lord Voldemort thinks it is power for him but obviously it's not. It's a stone and a useless piece of junk (supposedly), which is then later, destroyed. But what then makes this film so magnificent? The original Quidditch matches of course and all the rest of the guts that fill in the movie and it is all from J.K. Rowling's magnificent, creative imagination. The story (the book) and the movie are both equally entertaining because the movie follows the story of the book very well. Then there's the very original character Lord Voldemort Wow how awesome was the very last scene when Lord Voldemort escapes in a very painful way from Professor Quirrel's weak body and how he turns to dust/dirt at the very end! One thing is for sure, the movie itself and book will become classics ten to fifteen years from now. They'll always remain classics to me, now and forever. Movie directed by Chris Columbus."
"Robert_duder","9","0","1","1 July 2006"," The start to something much more phenomenal, a cinematic miracle
","Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone was the beginning of cinematic history. At the time of it's release it became the second highest grossing film of all time. It spawned a series of films that have absolutely only gotten better. It launched the career of it's three youngsters who seemed to have been absolutely built for these roles. It brought to the screen an epic fantasy adventure with kids in mind but without holding back a single thing like no other film had ever done. Philosopher's Stone is so important because it gives us the background and beginnings of the famous boy wizard. The film introduces us to characters and locations that fans of the book would be shown like never before. This film captured the book probably better than any other book to film transition in history.<br/><br/>The three youngsters were brand new to Cinema and now will be forever locked to this series. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter. Harry Potter was already a literary masterpiece up there with Huck Finn or Tom Sawyer. But it's not only that he was able to get this part it's that he absolutely IS Harry Potter. Even in this first film before he really gets comfortable with the part his performance is perfect. He looks the part, sounds the part and acts the part. Harry's general submersion into the Wizard world having never known where he comes from is a huge moment and Radcliffe just draws you into that. He has big sparkling eyes and facial expressions that make you feel each emotion. Rupert Grint plays Harry's new best friend Ron Weasley. Grint has a big part on his young shoulders playing the nervous and unstoppably shy Ron. Although the big difference between this film and the future installments is Ron really takes matters into his hands and even sacrifices himself for Harry. He gets some huge bravery points and really comes out of his shell. But Grint still plays the jittery youngster very well. Out of the three of them the one I have the most hope for doing other things in the future is lovely young Emma Watson who plays the absolutely insatiable Hermione Granger. Hermione is loud, outspoken, strong, a powerful wizard, but also deeply sensitive underneath it all. She has this powerful bond to both Harry and Ron and they form an unstoppable friendship. Watson just has this sparkle and bite to her that I think will make her a fantastic actress and makes her absolutely perfect for Hermione Granger. The three of them have terrific chemistry and this film shows their first meeting and the bond of their friendship already. Lastly the thing that makes the Harry Potter films including this one so outstanding is the unbelievable supporting cast which features some of the greatest, veteran actors of their kind. And they aren't used sparingly and they don't downplay their small roles but rather give stand out, brilliant performances. One of my favorite characters is Rubeus Hagrid played by Robbie Coltrane. I felt like he was played almost a little too foolish in this first installment but he is still a loving giant that cares a lot for the kids at Hogwart's and also manages to take in some peculiar pets as well. The late, amazing Richard Harris plays master wizard, head master of the school and Harry's ultimate mentor Albus Dumbledore. Harris created the image and voice and personality of on-screen Dumbledore and he did a terrific job. He's mysterious and important and has an aura about him. Maggie Smith plays Professor Minerva McGonagall, the ever watching Professor who always catches the kids in situations they shouldn't be in. She's terrific and I would love to see her get a slightly larger role in the future. Second only to Hagrid one of my favorite characters is played by Alan Rickman, Professor Severus Snape. He's probably the most evil looking good guy in any film. He is to the bone a good guy and yet has this bad guy look about him. In this film he is implied of course as the bad guy but turns out to be a hero amongst the teachers. And finally Ian Hart plays Voldemort's Hench man and teacher of the dark arts defense Professor Quirinus Quirrell. His role is basically quite small until the last half hour of the film but in that last half hour he really does a terrific job as the bad guy and Harry's adversary.<br/><br/>The brilliance of how this cast fits together and fits their roles is completely unexplainable. You have to see it and future films to understand the true meaning of how incredible this film series comes together and this is the one that started it all. The dark overtone of the film, Harry's sad story and his quest to belong and touch base with his parents whom he lost before he could even remember is seemingly too dark for children, or so other film makers would have you believe. Certainly director Chris Columbus is no stranger to kid's films or even films about overcoming adversity, he's a great director that makes you feel his films. He does probably lighten the whole Harry Potter mood certainly more than the directors who took over the last two installments. The special effects in Harry Potter are stunning especially watching the Quidditch game which really is a high point of the film. I find that the film is really blatantly heavy with CGI hence why perhaps I didn't tack on a perfect score like I did for the final two films. They seem to use the CGI special effects much better later on. Fluffy, the three headed monster dog, as cool of a character as he was looked nearly completely animated. Still Children won't notice it and it's absolutely breath taking for them and for adults the story and the adventure is equally as strong and a must see. 9/10"

","I will never, ever forgive myself (just kidding) if I never gave a review to this. Given though I only became a Potter fan after I watched this on DVD, I so know I have to do it.<br/><br/>There must be something about this first instalment that it was actually being aired twice here on the television, with the latest like early last month. I watched it the first time when it was on the television. It really brought back the memories for me.<br/><br/>Based on the best-selling debut novel from JK Rowling, it's about the adventures of Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) who realises that on his 11th birthday that he is actually a wizard from Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) who came to receive him. And a famous one, even when Harry was a year old. Thus, it became the beginning of his school life and various adventures at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Some of those people he met were like, the son of an old wizarding family- Ronald 'Ron' Weasley (Rupert Grint), the very smart witch who is actually of Muggle (non-magical people, in Potter-speak) parentage- Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), the one whom Harry soon knew will become one of those he will never always like- Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and so on. It was because of a troll incident in the girls' toilet (yes, Harry and Ron went there to save Hermione) that Harry, Ron and Hermione became the best of friends since.<br/><br/>Harry was also being discovered as being the youngest Seeker since a century ago as well. His 'popularity' grew. But, someone in the school does not seemed to like him at all like Malfoy. It's his Potions professor- Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Harry, Ron and Hermione thought it was Snape who was being the bad guy in wanting to steal the sorcerer's stone.<br/><br/>But it's someone else. Their Defense Against The Dark Arts Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart). They only found out very much later after Harry confronted Quirrell.<br/><br/>Now, with me only being hooked on the Potter series after watching it like four years ago on the DVD, it was start of the endless magic in the series to come. Any Potter fans will surely love this!"

","'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a film that is not only a great beginning to the HP series, but it stands up well as a family mystery film, with a few light hearted moments here and there. Add in an almost dead on adaptation of the phenomenal novel, 3 nice showings from the young kids, and an excellent supporting cast, 'Sorcerer's Stone' is a winner.<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has always been shunned aside his whole life. His parents died in a car crash at the tender age of 1, and he's been very reluctantly raised by his aunt and uncle, Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Vernon (Richard Griffiths). Add in their bratty son Dudley (Harry Melling), and you've got one bad childhood for young Harry. Then, one night, after days of mysterious letters from a place called Hogwarts, a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) tells Harry that he's a wizard! However, Harry does learn some disturbing news along with this great news. His parents were not killed in a car crash, but murdered, by the most evil wizard in the world, Lord Voldemort, who then failed in his attempt to kill Harry, then fled, his powers mysteriously broken....Harry then comes to Hogwarts, the school for wizards, makes 2 friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and later Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). He also makes his fair share of enemies, including Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), while meeting the mysterious staff and leaders of Hogwarts, including the fatherly Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris), his housemaster Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith), the oft-frightened Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart), and the dark and mysterious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Welcome to Harry's first year at Hogwarts!<br/><br/>The film gets strong supporting performances from the adults, especially the four I just mentioned. Ian Hart gives a great performance as the always scared, extremely apprehensive Quirrell, while keeping a mysterious aura about him. Rickman is once again excellent as the most mysterious character in the entire series. Harris and Smith add the two parental figures that Harry's lacked his whole life, guiding him and disciplining him together.<br/><br/>As this is a children's film, the fact that it stays entertaining and will keep adults interested makes it even better. It's a great film for the whole family to enjoy, with some funny moments from Rupert Grint and Richard Harris towards the end. The young children give off great performances for 10 and 11 year olds, and it's definitely a good sign for the future of the series. The direction is good from Chris Columbus, keeping it easy to follow for the kids. There are some scary moments, so I'd say kids under 8 years old could be frightened a bit. This is the only one of the Potter's that is well written, so enjoy it now. John Williams also gives a great score and a landmark theme that you'll have stuck in your head for a while. 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a real winner for the whole family. Have fun!! 8/10 --spy"

I never even get to the opening scene. well unfortunately I am forced back out of his room when he falls asleep leaving me now no excuse to not go into the living room to torture myself to sleep watching this awful movie. I think to myself, the bathroom? No dice, the children offer to pause the movie for me. UHhh, alright, I will watch what is left. Maybe 40 minutes, I tell myself as I sit down. ""What is happening?"", ""Shhhhhh!"" they tell me. ""who is that?"" I ask. I get a finger telling me to wait a minute. ""wait, rewind it a second, did that just happen?"" ""ARRRRRRRR"" the kids yell ""watch it on your own time let us finish it!"" they yell. and sure enough I did. Since then I have read the books ( took me like 4 days to read the two books that where out then) and have been hooked on the books since. I loved the second movie but compared to the books, the 3rd and 4th movies where flops. this movie was the bait and will always be loved. It follows the book pretty closely and the director did a great job with everything."

","This was an excellent movie. It really was very faithful to the original book. I loved the cast. They were all perfectly cast into their proper roles. Especially Daniel Radcliffe. He is Harry Potter and I hope he stays Harry Potter for the entire Harry Potter series.<br/><br/>I heard that Steven Spielberg was approached to direct this film and he wanted Haley Joel Osment to play Harry. Well all I can say to that is I am glad that J.K. Rowling fought back and demanded an all British cast. If there was an American cast I think the movie would not have turned out as good as it already has.

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful film. Loking back, Chris Columbus, the great pop film maker, deserved an Oscar nomination for this film. THere are no wrong choices, showing the world of Hogwarts from Harry's eyes, letting us discover this strange and scary world with him.<br/><br/>It is by no means violent and is as scary as it needs to be. Most children will be able to handle this film and sleep soundly the same night.<br/><br/>What I love about the movie, more than the CGI and special effects, is the building of the relationshio with Ron, Hermoine and Harry. Really, they are three outcast nerds and in spite of Harry's celebrity and power and new found wealth, he chooses them for friends forsaking the likes of the other rich kids. It is a subtle but very strong positive message for kids.<br/><br/>In spite of its running length it can easily hold a child's attention, jumping from trolls to dragons to goblins to quiddich matches, mixing it all in with moments of trues pathos as Harry discovers the truth about his family. Daniel Radcliffe succeeds in portraying Harry as a likable, flawed, emerging hero, fascinated with his own power, but keeping everything in check. (one of the great achievements of this film is how well it is cast, considering the huge number of speaking roles).<br/><br/>Aside from a little uneven acting from the young newcomers in the cast, this film does not strike a wrong note. ***1/2 out of ****."

He learns that he is actually from a magical family, and this takes him to a magical school called Hogwarts where he meets two good friends Hermione and Ron and unfortunately makes some enemies with a couple bullies.

","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the start of the Harry Potter movie series- which is an excellent series, by the way!

His grandparents are reluctant to send him, but luckily, Hagrid comes and takes Harry to his new school. Unfourtunatley, Voldemort (He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named) the man who killed Harry's parents is lurking about the school, searching for Harry.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone makes a solid fantasy movie, but it seems to have a few clichés. And, it seems to be pretty simple and undeserving of a higher, for an odd reason, I cannot think of at the moment. I guess it just seems to un-imaginative. Magic and fantasy creatures don't immediately make a movie look imaginative.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is the start of a fantastic series, but easily the 'lightest.'

","The first thing that has annoyed me is that I came to write a comment about Harry Potter and the PHILOSOPHER'S!!! Stone. Why the American's have changed the title I do not know. The PHILOSOPHER'S Stone is a much better title but maybe the American publicists felt that they had to dumb it down but I do not understand why as it does not need a lot of extra brain power to pronounce the extra syllable!! This is one of my favourite children's films, mainly because I fell in love with the book. It was the first children's book that I really got into and was left wanting more after the last page. Although this film does follow the book in terms of plot it did leave many of the enchanting subplot's out. Such as when Harry is recounting his muggle life and the way that he flew up to a chimney to avoid the bullies. This would have looked great on film and many kids could relate to it.<br/><br/>My favourite parts of the films were the final 1/2 and hour when Harry, Ron and Hermione are going through the spells to protect the PHILOSOPHER'S Stone. Then finally the brave battle with Lord Voldemort. I must say that when I read the book though, I imagined his face to be very different but as it was a book, many different people have different perceptions. I also loved the very end when Dumbledore is giving the house points out. This is the perfect ending as the audience are invited to hate the Slytherin's. The celebrations leave you with happiness as if you were a Gryfindor yourself.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved this film but it would have been better if it had done the same as the Lord of the Rings and followed the book to the tee."

The kids that play the main characters are properly cast, along with the adults (especially Alan Rickman as Severus Snape and especially Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore - he is sorely missed after Chamber of Secrets, RIP).

","Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone (I prefer to use the original British title) is a wonderful experience: good script, great visuals, extraordinary actors... However, there's a ""but"", which is the following: it's excessively faithful to the source novel, leaving out only one or two side characters. The movie, which tells how a seemingly normal boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), discovers he is actually a wizard and starts attending a school named Hogwarts, encountering many dangers throughout his first year, isn't boring for a second during its 146 minutes, but the pace is occasionally slowed down because, like in other ""part 1 of 3"" movies (actually, they're supposed to be 7), the director spends a lot of time introducing and explaining things, so he won't have to do it in the sequel(s). In this case, Chris Columbus, best known for Home Alone includes as much as possible also to make sure the target audience (kids) will enjoy it, adult viewers being more used to differences between book and film (and thus perhaps likely to find the running time a bit excessive). <br/><br/>Nonetheless,the movie is great, Columbus using all the tools at his disposal to bring J. K. Rowling's enchanted universe to the screen. And the magic is in every single frame: from potions to talking hats to Quidditch games, it's pretty clear nothing ordinary can possibly happen, and all of it looks real, thanks to brilliantly accomplished special effects and CGI. But the movie's strength doesn't lie only in the visual aspect: there's also an impressive ensemble cast, consisting of some of Britain's finest actors. All of them are impressive, but it si of course the adult section of the cast that pulls off a superior job, having more experience and knowing how to add substance to an array of fascinating characters (standouts include Robbie Coltrane as a gigantic caretaker, Alan Rickman as a sinister teacher and of course Richard Harris, who plays Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore with unmatched charm and warmth).<br/><br/>Aside from a few ""slow"" bits, this is a good start for what will certainly be one of the defining franchises of the 21st century.<br/><br/>To paraphrase Dumbledore: let the feast begin..."
"semi_cool18","7","0","2","17 November 2005"," Entertaining
","I'm a big fan of J.K. Rowling's books, and this movie succeeded in capturing the magic of the book, at least at a certain level. I'm not going to lie: I know that none of the movies will be able to truly capture the spirit of the books. Rowling's true world of Hogwarts lies in the realm of literature, and this is a different medium.<br/><br/>That being said, it was a good movie. There are a few nitpicks concerning how I would've casted a few characters more to my liking, but I won't get into that, since probably everyone could complain about something. Overall, it was well cast. Harry looks the part, and Richard Harris as Dumbledore is excellent. Also, the world looks pretty much what one would think of when visualizing the book. Hogwarts especially looks great, and is full of mystery and life.<br/><br/>The movie of course has to cut out some parts of the book, and I have no complaints concerning that. It sticks to all the main things very well, and the story is compelling and fun. Also, it manages to convey the light-heartedness and comedy that the books are full of. The acting is a little spotty, but then again, we're dealing with young kids here, and I'm sure that will improve as the series goes on.<br/><br/>Sorcerer's Stone is full of adventure, comedy, danger, and magic, and is entertaining and fun."

","Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin Dudley AKA the Dursleys. His parents were both killed in a car crash when he was very young and he has always been quite strange ever since. Lately, he has been feeling a little stranger than usual. His cousin Dudley has been attacked by a snake when Harry wanted to hurt him and mysterious letters for Harry have been showing up that The Dursleys have UN-mistakenly been trying to hide form him. Harry soon finds out the reason for all of these incidents: He is a wizard. Not only that, he also finds out that he will be attending Hogwarts (Wizarding school for Wizards and Witches) and that his parents were murdered by the most evil of all wizards, Voldemort, who was mysteriously destroyed by Harry.<br/><br/>On his journey to Hogwarts, Harry makes two friends in Ron Weasely (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) along with a rival in Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Harry quickly learns of life in the wizard world and finds himself to be quite the celebrity due to his Quidditch (A popular wizard sport played on brooms) skills and his encounter with Voldemort. The movie also stars Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape.<br/><br/>This is the first of seven beloved movies adapted from the books by J.K. Rowling. In general, the book is usually better than the movie, and this is no exception, although it is a wonderful adaptation. The acting of the kids was made the movie incredibly entertaining and the effects were done brilliantly. This comes as no surprise, due to the massive book sales that created such a large budget for the film. But one of the greatest things about this movie is that they didn't go for star actors. Yes, you do have Richard Harris and Alan Rickman but they very well-known. Even the biggest star in the movie John Cleese played the very minor role of Nearly Headless Nick. This was a great opportunity to make another great saga of film and they made a wonderful start by not using big names. Overall, this is a great beginning to what hopes to be incredible chronicles and is a wonderful adaptation of the book.<br/><br/>I recommend this film"

Anyone that has not read the book could tell you that the stuff left out is just details and fluff but a for a reader knows those are what make the Harry Potters so great. The movie is just a spectacular action/fantasy movie, but the book is a story about students at a school with real plots and problems. Yes the effects are good, and the magic is exciting but the feeling that the characters are real is lost.

"critical-escapist","9","0","1","29 September 2005"," Filled with delight and excitement with constant wonders to be opened and is easily transformed from words to motion
","When I first went into the cinema to see a film, I was originally going to see K-PAX since I was a huge Kevin Spacey fan. Turns out that the film is going to run late because it's opening weekend for the newest Harry Potter film. Being a semi-Harry Potter fan at the time, I didn't mind, I wanted to see a film at the moment, so I thought, ""Why not?"" My other choice was probably the Disney/Pixar film Monsters Inc, but I was happy that I invested my eight bucks on this film, because it is worth it - or at least more than Monsters Inc - but that's a different story.<br/><br/>I have read the original material by JK Rowling back in the late 1990s so I do know what's going on. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone starts in sort of a weary tone, with a death of a infant's parents, sent to his aunt and uncle. A few minutes later, I was shocked how enjoyable the film is. I had a form a delight rushing through my sleeves. That was when I decided that I would rather watch this than the seriously-toned K-PAX.<br/><br/>As the film arrives at its main location, Hogwarts, director Chris Columbus (whoa - from Home Alone to fabulous set designs) puts magic into the school as much as Rowling's novel has done. The school is beautiful and is exactly how fans may imagined it. The school is glamorous and it's just wonderful. It has breathtaking scenes.<br/><br/>There is a very attractive all-star UK cast, such as Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, etc. I was surprised how they got all those actors to participate in this film. But not to mention, the child actors were all right as well, almost the way we have imagined them - in looks, I mean. Daniel Radcliffe makes a semi-believable Harry, or it looks like he's doing an impression of Harry, but that's all right because his acting is sort of a minimal part of the film. If Radcliffe's acting was getting on my nerves, I can easily stare into the background of castles and wonderful costumes. Rupert Grint is a pretty natural actor, as plucky Ron Weasley. You kind of like him, because he is normal and you can relate to such a person. Most of all, I loved the portrayal of Hermione Granger, played by Emma Watson. As Richard Roeper puts it, she reminds you of Holly Hunter in James L. Brooks memorable classic, Broadcast News. Without Watson in the cast, the three leads would be plain and boring, and whoever who was chosen for the part would be just be stepping into the place of destiny. I thought Alan Rickman was a wise choice for one of my favorite characters, or classic villains - Severus Snape. He brings life into the serious-toned teacher and he makes him sort of a borderline human being. You have to like him because of his strict portrayal of Snape make you chuckle. Richard Harris gives a sentimental performance as Dumbledore, which is as much enjoyable as Rickman's portrayal as Snape. Same goes to the portrayal of Hagrid, which I enjoyed as much as I did to the rest of the cast. The cast is well-chosen - or at least bearable for fans of these well-loved characters.<br/><br/>The story is simply put on screen. Steve Kloves, the American screenwriter who wrote/directed the nostalgic Michelle Pfeiffer and Bridges brothers flick, The Fabulous Baker Boys, really pulls this one through. You can almost feel that he knows the book and most of all, he stays true to the book through his script. I think Chris Columbus matured in his story. Maybe he's not a Cameron Crowe-actor-director, you can see he really knows the book and read everything carefully because his decisions for the sets are perfect because the sets flow nicely with the book. Even though the so-called special effects were a bit corny (like the three-headed dog, Fluffy), you kind of forget about those stuff and go with the flow because Columbus is a master of these somewhat-classic films because he really knows his family films. He is great at working with child actors - in the past he has worked with Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone), Jena Malone (Stepmom), etc. Columbus is one of those directors who makes entertaining films that almost everyone can bear, and that is what makes him so great. His films may not have the signature of ""Colubmus"" on it, but you like them and you smile all the way through.<br/><br/>This is an enjoyable film for all ages (I hope it's not too scary for younger kids) and I don't think you have to like the book to like the movie. It's a very entertaining film (credit: Chris Columbus) and the sets and costumes are wonderful, the dialogue and characters stays true to the book, and there are not extra snippets or ridiculous put-ons that may ruin the books. This is my opinion of course because many prefer Alfonso Cuaron's take on Harry Potter films in the third film (Prisoner of Azkaban) but people must understand that Columbus and Cuaron are different directors and they have different takes on what they think a film should be. I think Columbus's vision of Harry Potter is much more similar to the original book's vision, so I must give full credit for that. All in all, this is a fairly enjoyable film with a fairly enjoyable plot line mixed with fine acting from the veterans of British cinema. I have seen this film 6 times and I wouldn't mind watching it again in the near-future."
"maatmouse","8","0","1","6 September 2005"," A Nice 1st year for Harry
","I came to reading the Harry Potter adventures after, for the want of something better to do, picked up the first book and enjoyed it immensely. The book is very readable, whatever age you are, and I rather hoped that the film would live up to expectations.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, it did. Chris Columbus does a really good job of bringing Rowling's boy wizard and his adventures nicely to the cinema. The whole film is a bit rushed but watching it, you get enough of an idea of what Harry's situation is and why he is at Hogwarts and who his chief nemesis is. The other children do an excellent job of support. Emma Watson is perhaps the most like her character of the swotty, bossy bookworm Hermione and Rupert, as Ron Weasley, does a great job both as some comic relief (his comments after witnessing Professor McGonagall's transformation from a cat to female for example) and as friend to Harry. I thought a lot of very unfair criticism had been directed at Daniel Radcliffe for his portrayal of Harry but I am not sure how much more Daniel could have done as much of his part consists (as with so many films incorporating a lot of special effects) with reacting properly to things which would have been put in later. In my view, he has nothing to apologise for. Long may Radcliffe play the part, hopefully to Harry's last book.<br/><br/>The teachers are brilliant. Rowling's insistence on a largely British and Irish cast has paid off and Coltrane's portrayal of Hagrid is just spot on as is the late Richard Harris playing Professor Dumbledore, a kind of surrogate grandfather to Harry. I thought too little was seen of Maggie Smith, though.<br/><br/>All in all, nicely played."

Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. In the non-magic human world--the world of ""Muggles""--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, pig like cousin Dudley. A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: ""We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."" Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, ""I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!""

"ShootingShark","8","0","1","12 June 2005"," Great Old-Fashioned Magical Children's Fantasy
","An orphan is amazed to discover the existence of a secret world of magic when he is whisked away to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. There he makes both friends and enemies amongst the pupils and teachers, develops his magical powers and confronts his destiny against the evil spirit which killed his parents and threatens to destroy the harmony of the magic realm.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling's series of Harry Potter books have achieved the near-impossible - they are bonafide modern-day children's classics. The movie of the first book is equally magical, telling a charming, funny, scary and mysterious tale with tremendous panache. Besides the wonderful story, the movie's prime asset is its terrific cast of familiar British actors hamming it up as the School staff. Particularly good are Coltrane as the school's giant groundskeeper Hagrid (""Oi shouldn't-a said that ... ""), a fine understated performance by Harris as headmaster Professor Dumbledore, Rickman as the weaselly yet intriguing Professor Snape, Bradley as the seriously creepy caretaker Filch, and a nifty cameo by John Hurt as a sagely wandmaker. The kids (Radcliffe, Grint, Watson & Felton) are all tremendous - director Columbus has managed to make their performances very natural yet maintain the wondrous fantasy element so important to the story. This is what makes the movie work so well, typified by the journey to Hogwarts sequence, which starts out in a slightly-altered version of reality (platform 9¾ at King's Cross Station) and moves into fully-fledged fantasy (the children glide on lantern-lit canoes towards a monstrous Gothic castle floating in the darkness ahead of them). As with all good escapist writing the characters are rooted in reality and you care about them, so that you can enjoy the mythic adventure but still respond to the story emotionally. A beautifully subtle score by John Williams, fantastic production design work by Stuart Craig (the realisation of Hogwarts through a combination of sets, locations and effects is simply brilliant) and beautiful photography by John Seale all serve to make the movie look and sound gorgeous. I love the way the film balances its themes of wonder and friendship with plenty of good old-fashioned scares - in particular, the sequence with the giant troll loose in the school and the forest scene where He Who Must Not Be Named makes his first appearance are fabulously frightening moments. This is a funny, delightful, quintessentially British classic children's movie."

","Note, that I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books written by J.K.

They make harry do all the chores, while they pamper their own son. But Harry is not an ordinary boy: he's a wizard and he's been accepted at wizard school of Hogwarts. So of to school we go. At Hogwarts he and his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) find out evil plot of Voldemort, ho wants to steal The Philosophers Stone, so he could get himself a body, him being partly dead and all.<br/><br/>What was surprising, was that even tough the movie is full of child actors, there isn't any highly annoying case among the cast. And there are many other great actors among adults, like Richard Harris as Dumbledore, head teacher of Hogwarts and Robbie Coltrane as friendly giant Hagrid.<br/><br/>Plot is over all very good, mixing fantasy and adventure very well. Visually movie is very good looking, but it does have some wooden looking CGI effects but fortunately they don't effect in the watching pleasure.<br/><br/>Over all very good adaptation from the first part of very popular book series."

""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" has to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The casting is just terrific. I am really glad that they cast an all British cast, since the books are all taking place in the UK (or at Hogwarts) ;). What I especially loved about the casting was that the three main characters were all newcomers to the screen. Daniel Radcliffe was BRILLIANT as Harry Potter. I cannot think of another actor who could bring him to life. Rupert Grint was great as Ron. I loved all of his expressions. :) And Emma Watson is great as Hermione (spelling?).<br/><br/>As for the professors, the late Richard Harris was an excellent choice for Dumbledore. Maggie Smith seems as if she was meant for the part. Alan Rickman was born to play Professor Snape...he was really scary at times! His monotone voice was great. :) I now own all three movies on DVD (I bought the Prisoner of Azkaban without seeing it first and didn't regret it at all) and am so glad I did!

"Rileeff","7","0","3","29 January 2005"," A tremendous, though flawed, romp for children
","I saw Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone last night with a friend of mine. It is the first time that I have seen a Harry Potter film. The movie is highly entertaining and enthralling. Richard Harris, as the old wizard, is the movie's Yoda and, in fact, there are many similarities between this movie and the original Star Wars trilogy. Spiritually superior kid Harry (Luke Skywalker) is sent to live with foster parents until he receives his calling to study wizardry (the force) and make his way as a powerhouse in the world (or galaxy.) The movie's weak spot is it's acting among the three main children. Harry is a super mature young person, scary for someone who's really just a kid and should be acting like one. His buddy, Weasely, is in the film as comic relief and no doubt received one acting command ""Look scared."" This he does often and well. The little girl (sorry don't remember her name and can't back arrow) is as cute as she can be but isn't a tremendously talented actress at this point in her young life. The backbone of the movie is it's delightful old guard. Maggie Smith, as delightful as ever, plays a witch/professor. Her presence and her voice are still absolute magic (important for a film about magic!) Robbie Coltrane is a great big teddy bear and he creeps into our hearts. John Cleese is a perfect casting move as Nearly Headless Nick, the almost headless ghost that hangs around the Hogwarts school. Alan Rickman is absolutely stone cold cool as the dark Professor Snape. He is so darn rigid that he talks almost without talking. There are tremendous little details in the movie, such as images in old paintings coming to life, that make the movie rich and absolute fun to look at. The plot is decent, although it's not very tight and there are reaches and lots of guesses (most of them correct) along the way when we think, ""How could they know that?"", etc. The movie is also delightfully (the last time I'll use the word delightful) English, told in a lighthearted and intellectual fashion. Fun entertainment, not for adults to watch more than once but new young viewers will (and have) eat it up."

","Like many people who had read the book before seeing the film I wasn't disappointed. A lot of the film was better than my visualisations when reading the book and the special effects are incredible. The casting is very good. It's a real shame that Richard Harris died. He was great as Dumbledore. Although Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall sometimes seems like Jean Brodie in a pointy hat (you wonder at what point she's going to say ""Gryffindor are the creme a la creme"") I still wouldn't have cast anyone else in the role. She's spot on. The character of Hagrid could have been written for Robbie Coltrane.Some scenes might be a bit intense for younger children but there's plenty in it to appeal to children of all ages and adults too. It is a fantasy story but there are plenty of things in it kids will identify with. Every school has a precocious poshly named girl like Hermione Grainger and a know-it-all who grasses on his mates like Draco Malfoy. Harry Potter appeals to the universal imagination and touches a nerve with a lot of people. I think it is a bit paranoid to say that it makes children interested in the occult and black magic as it is pure fantasy. I think it is more likely to make kids want to run at the brick pillars between platforms 9 and 10 at King's Cross Station in the hope that they'll go through the wall and they'll be able to board the Hogwarts Express!"
"soneil12","9","0","2","3 January 2005"," Sticking to the book is not a bad thing at all
","I hear a lot of people complain that this film is just the same as the book. Personally I can't see how that's a bad thing. After seeing huge liberties taken with the work of some of my other favourite authors such as Tom Clancy and Tolkien I think it's a relief to see a film that tells the same version of the story that became a hit. When I read a book I do picture how it might look on screen but I don't sit there thinking, ""I wonder how this would look if the director decided to add his own spin on it. I imagine seeing it the way it's described in the book. This film provides an exceptional visualisation of the story that fans of the book have come to love. After all, if the version in the book wasn't good enough, it wouldn't have become popular enough to be made in to a film in the first place."

"Kempywood","9","0","1","15 September 2004"," how to start with hatred and end with enjoyment
","SPOILER???<br/><br/>To say that I was skeptical about watching this movie is a major understatement, I was annoyed by the whole furor that the boy with the lightning shaped scar would bring. This was multiplied by the fact that I was working in a cinema at the time (as I was for the release of all three so far) and the pre booked tickets had already sold out the entire first weekend, I knew that I wasn't about to watch it anytime soon. So when it came to choosing an in-flight movie on my first trip to Florida I was a bit worried about the choices I had, and after viewing Ocean's Eleven and a couple of TV sitcoms I eventually gave in and began Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone over here in the US) now whilst watching it on the back of the seat in front on that small screen I not only noticed that I'd seen a lot of the scenes already when screen checking but I also realized that I was beginning to enjoy the movie. I thought the actors were incredible even the child actors to a small degree although they could have done with a little bit of work especially Emma Watson (Hermione) who was over pronouncing every single line. Other than that though there isn't much you can complain about and I certainly didn't until that is that I read the first book and noticed how much was left out including a certain poltergeist who still goes by unknown to anyone who hasn't read the J.K. Rowling books.<br/><br/>Harry Potter 1 is a story of a young boy finding out he's not only a magical background but also that he's the most famous name in the whole of the wizard world, not only this but he'd been enrolled into the finest wizard school in the whole world, Hogwarts. Along with finding friends galore in Hermione and Ron he finds out about his enemies not just he who must not be named (Lord Voldemort) but also that of the slytherin house Malfoy his two cronies Crabbe and Goyle plus also Potions professor Snape.<br/><br/>Through all that hatred of the books by Miss Rowling what made me change my mind? Maybe it was that attraction to both children and adults alike or just a nice sense of the old good and evil battle that led me to not only watch this movie but Chamber and Prisoner plus to read all five books so far. Maybe however this world is real and J.K. Rowling is a witch who has cast a spell on us all. No matter what though I recommend that everybody watch this if they've so far escaped the draw of Harry Potter believe me it really is worth listening to the hype."

","I took my little brother to see the second movie in this series, was very pleasantly surprised by it (also because it's a great movie to watch with a little kid), and so my family had no trouble getting me out of the house to see this one (which is more than can be said for the books, at least.) This is every bit as good as the second movie and for a blockbuster Hollywood fantasy film I go with it over the recent Lord of the Rings entry. This movie is an improvement in terms of plotting, with some clever mixing of chronology, but a step back in terms of action - the amazing aerial dogfighting of the second movie is unfortunately pared down in this one. But the real winner is again that amazing castle. Forget about the drama and just enjoy being carried through the castle.<br/><br/>I haven't read the books but i cant imagine the experience is as interesting as watching these movies, because the whole appeal is the visual tone of the setting.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I, personally, LOVE the Harry Potter books, and for me, this film was rather a disappointment.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>At first, Quidditch. Yes, I know it's a rather important part in the book, and I know it's a reason for the special effects people to up their paycheques, but please, IT IS NOT WORTH FORSAKING THE STORYLINE FOR TWENTY MINUTES OF WATCHING DANIEL RADCLIFFE ON A BROOM CHASING A BALL!!!!!!!!! It's infuriating! I'd hate to be someone who didn't read the book and stupidly decided to watch the film anyway, they wouldn't have had a clue what was going on. I love the way how the director claims there wasn't enough time for the rest of the movie, when there is clearly enough time to stick in half an hour of Quidditch. It would be worth it if it was well done, and had just a vague similarity to the book, but it doesn't. The director goes off on some little fantasy of pointless loop-the-loops, upside down flying, and other stupid stunts that nobody really cares about.<br/><br/>The actors, on the other hand, are first class, even the kids, Rupert Grint is hilarious as Ron Weasly,however, call me critical, but somebody should really have put that script through the shredder and started from scratch, because it's appalling. It's as wooden and flat as a door, and has about as much emotion as wet mop. The music has some good bits, but most of it is at the wrong time, and in the wrong place. <br/><br/>However, if you're feeling particularly shallow minded, are a fan of sports, don't give a hoot about plot lines and need to watch something light hearted with a few good laughs, then you should find this a very enjoyable film."

","""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the first film of the popular series about a boy wizard based on the books by J.K. Rowling. And in my opinion movie fantasies don't get any better than this. This is a terrific movie that has a lot going for it: great directing, wonderful storytelling, and fine acting. No wonder this series as already become a phenomenon.<br/><br/>This first adventure introduces us to Harry Potter, a young boy who discovers on his 11th birthday that he's a wizard, and goes on to fulfill his destiny at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Fast-paced, funny, and wonderfully entertaining, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" never disappoints. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Emma Watson (Hermione Grainger), and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) will have long careers thanks to this series. And don't forget that veteran British cast (Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, etc.). Everybody's terrific, with my favorite performances coming from Watson and Coltrane.<br/><br/>Sure this is a long movie at 152 minutes, but to me it felt a little shorter than that, thanks to its fast pace. Director Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"") wanted to get every element of the book into the film, and therefore he succeeded. Not to mention the beautifully technical aspects of the movie, which received well deserved Oscar nominations for Original Score, Art Direction, and Costume Design (should have gotten another nod for Visual Effects). And what comes out of this movie is one very entertaining show. Kids all around the world love this film, and well they should. This is a family film that even adults can like.

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>As I sit here, I've just finished watching ""Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone"" (Sorcerer if your from America) and it occurs to me that this is the first time in ages that I've been sober during this film. Don't understand why, but that's the way it happened. When I first watched this film I confess I'd been avoiding the world of Harry Potter for some considerable time. Stemming primarily from reading a chapter of the book, I'd had a large dislike for the whole phenomenon for ages. That first night of Potter however, I'd made the mistake of drinking a lot and agreeing to sit and watch it with some friends. Whilst the memories were vague, I remembered enjoying it and forced myself a few weeks afterwards to watch it again. The first of the Harry Potter films is that entertaining.<br/><br/>In this installment, Chris Columbus introduces us to the world of Hogwarts and it's inhabitants. Whilst never reading more than that one section of the book, I've been fascinated by the film versions of them since watching this version. The character of Hagrid in particular makes me laugh, but he's not alone.<br/><br/>All in all, the first film of the Harry Potter trilogy is a success. The children look remarkably young compared with the recently released third film, but that doesn't make their acting any less impressive for their age. Daniel Radcliffe in particular deserves credit for his role as Harry, but Emma Watson and Rupert Grint both give him a good run for his money.<br/><br/>In regard to the entire series, this film is a great starting point from which to build on. The second develops from this, and according to most critical reviews so far, the third expands on that one again. If the series continues this way, the fourth could be breathtaking. That is assuming the creators DO keep Radcliffe and company in the main roles. The second they are replaced by fresh blood, the second the series dies. All in all though, lets not dwell on the future. For the time being, the first of the series is a film to sit and enjoy. It might not be as good as the later films, but that's no criticism. Watch this film as a prelude to the others OR watch it as a film in itself, ultimately though, make sure you watch it."

It took me awhile to figure out why, especially in an area where the writer had a chance to cut loose and present some truly fantastic characters, themes, and situations--to do something original and profound.  That chance was never taken--the presented conflicts are superficial, the obstacles ankle high, the outcome never in doubt.<br/><br/>That is what is at fault with the story's construction, but the cause of that fault is essentially that this is a Mary Sue story, or in this case a Gary Stu story: one in which the central character is considered wonderful & talented, generally through no fault or cause of his own, and nearly everyone comes to admire him by the story's end.  In other words, the story is on a level with most fanfic, in which the author inserts himself as the main character and spends most of the storytime imagining fantasies of universal acclaim and wish-fulfillment best left abandoned by the early teens.<br/><br/>There are of course good fantasy films and novels, but I'm afraid this isn't one of them.  And there are also films for children which adults will find entertaining, but I doubt this is one of those either.  I imagine, instead, that the film is perhaps a bit boring to most people who aren't blessed enough to be the author."

","Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>While the Harry Potter movies in general are worth watching once for a familiarity with the storyline and the rather beautiful shots of each one, they are worth no more than that, unless you're less than 13 years of age. While J.K. Rowling's world, even more enchanting in film than in book, it quite unique its blatant black-and-white-ness is ridiculous at best and angering at worst.<br/><br/>This is a world where students are sorted from day one as to whether they will be evil or good and God forbid they break from those roles.<br/><br/>
To say nothing of the fact that Harry's ability to absorb all the attention and action in every scene makes one wonder if anyone else in this world could even exist without him.<br/><br/>The only major redeeming factors in this movie are the excellent portrayls of Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape. Dumbledore can be excused from his pure whiteness for the mere fact that he is both mysterious and rather insane. Severus Snape, on the other hand, is the only character given any hope of proving evil as well as good.<br/><br/>The Magic of this story is purely in the wonderful sets and special effects the movie makers used. Anyone looking for depth of character or unexpected revelations will be sorely disappointed"

","The first outing of the Harry Potter franchise. I've not read any of the Harry Potter books and whilst this is undoubtedly targeted at the childrens market there's still plenty of entertainment on offer.<br/><br/>The first film introduces us to the cast. Harry Potter has survived Voldemort's attempt to kill him as a child and is quite a celebrity. He befriends Ron and Hermione as he goes to Hogwarts for the first term. A nice opening film and a good introduction to the franchise."

","The Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Hey, I'm from England)movie was brilliant. I watched that before I read the books and I loved it. So many people make cruel comments about the fact that it didn't live up to the book but that really isn't the point is it? It was there to be enjoyed and on the whole, it was. You can't expect a movie of this magnitude to be made without some things being cut out. If the whole book was made into a movie, with every detail intact, it would last for a good 3 hours and while I can sit that long, many children can't. In my eyes, the books and the movies are separate things with the same names and I love them equally."

","Consider this review for the Harry Potter epic as a whole...<br/><br/>
Perhaps it is because I am not a reader of the books, but I don't understand the Potter hype. Now, when ""The Worst Witch"" was in good syndication, I never missed a chance to catch that on TV and I've been trying to track down a video of it. In my opinion, ""The Worst Witch"" runs circles around Harry Potter and his gang. Now I understand that special effects, fancy camera tricks, and that cinematic feel is not necessarily present in ""Witch"" - BUT - lets do a little comparison, and ignore the distinct differences for right now.<br/><br/>Many of the plot elements and characterization of ""Potter"" are almost directly taken right out of ""Witch"" -- the cursed broomstick, the flying lesson, the basic idea of witch school and the customs, the headmistress, and the potion gone wrong... etc... now, I think it's mighty fine for artists to mimic others and combine new slants with old ideas. I just think ""Witch"" did a much better job. <br/><br/>Now I am a huge fan of simplicity and understated elegance on camera, which is evident in such adventure epics as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and other classics that are certainly some of my favorites. But I can't stand one-dimensional characters. And unfortunately, to the credit of the younger Harry Potter actor, or his director - but probably his writer, he is as interesting as a molding peace of cheese - maybe somewhat interesting at times, but not at all appealing. And I have a lot of beef with computer generated graphics - because they do not look even remotely authentic. Spielberg's original ET is much more charming and realistic looking than his new digital one in the special release DVD, and I think even Star Wars fans can agree that the characters in the original trilogy are much easier to relate to and appreciate than the new cartoons... and Spiderman's little tricks were not that impressive... Now ""Lord of the Rings"" did prevail in the digital world... but in general, if you're going digital - get it right, or go digital all the way (like ""Toy Story"", or ""Finding Nemo"") --- Any way, I hope I'm getting my point across..<br/><br/>Bottom line - Harry Potter is way to farcical for my taste, and while I may be enveloped in some nice suspense while watching in the theater and I enjoy a lot of the visuals and basic entertainment of it all - that is it. There is nothing below the surface here, and that bores me to death. And if like other fantasies, their was a clearer magic logic, perhaps this movie would go much further for me. For example, ""Witch"" had such a realism to it, like ""Wizard of Oz"", ""LOTR"" and ""Willy Wonka"" did - but ""Harry Potter"" just lacks that believability. <br/><br/>If only Spielberg had directed as he was originally going to do with Haley Joel Osmant in the lead - but they had to go British, didn't they?"

","HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE / Starring: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson / Rated PG / ***<br/><br/>If you told me that the director of the 1993 slapstick comedy Mrs. Doubtfire would soon be helming the adaptation of one of the most beloved pop culture books of the late ninties, you could've knocked me over with a feather. Nor would I be able to believe that the author of the five published books would soon become richer than the Royal Family. The film was one of the most anticipated movies of the year 2001, it broke box office records, had a possible hit at the $600 million Titanic and garnered itself three technical Oscar nominations. I stated some of the things that bestowed this film, but there is much more to this, that neither movie or book has reached: This is only the empire known as Harry Potter.<br/><br/>The phenomenon started not on screen but in the head of a single mother scribbling all of this on pieces of paper in a Scotland cafe. J.K Rowling wrote snippets and pieces of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, struggling as a mother on welfare. She had no idea that this little tale would start the biggest franchise (complete with sequels and spinoffs) since the original Star Wars trilogy. Never did she think that in years to come, children and adults around the world would be dressing up as witches and wizards awaiting upcoming stories of her character. Well, magic seemed to have struck her in the head. All of these things have happened and now a film adaptation has arrived (and no one doubted it for a second) of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The print media was restless, critics were dying with anticipation and crowds of kids young and old are peeing in their pants. And the question comes.....Does it live up to expectations?<br/><br/>The answer is a reassuring yes. Yes, yes, the first installment of the bespectacled boy finding out he is a wizard has been hyped by the readers, the critics, the distribution company (using $40 million to advertise it, of course) and the media, both print and televised. I had almost given up hope that the first movie based on Rowling's first novel, The Sorcerer's Stone, would live up to all these cloud-high claims. But alas! magic is in the world and has also struck me in the head! I'll say it to you once more: Harry Potter lives up to expectations. Relieved? Good, but now let's go deeper into this assured statement: Does it pass expectations? Nah, don't count on it. It doesn't go that deep!<br/><br/>After finding out about his true roots, good lad Daniel Radcliffe, playing the 'boy who lived' himself, treks off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (with owl, cauldron and wand in hand). Harry believes he'll be facing school tests and homework by himself, but on the train he meets freckled Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and bossy-brainy Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). All three of these actors have exubrent talent in their character's shoes. Watson hits three homeruns as Hermione, the bookworm bent on following rules and never allowing her homework to be copied. Grint is perhaps not as delightful or as fun to watch as Watson, but the good-hearted redhead has some of the best lines in the whole movie. Consider a scene as the trio are caught in the grasps of a tendril (which you must keep very still to survive) deep inside the school. Grint's Ron is squirming, gasping and yelling for dear life as Harry and Hermione free themselves. After getting loose, Rupert hams it all up: ""Phew! Lucky we didn't panic!""<br/><br/>But what about Harry? This mysterious, shady boy in the title role is not quite the same as his colorful comrades but more of a quiet kid in this film than he was in the book. In the book, Harry is pretty uncertain and unsure that he can live up to what everyone around him claims he is to be. He doesn't want to be famous, nor gawked at everywhere he goes. In the film, he is quiet and that's what you can only come up with at a very distance. In the distance, there really is no sense of what he actually feels like, which I really can't call a flaw. A book and a film are completely different media, and in a book you can express what Harry is feeling at every moment. You can not do that in a film. Daniel Radcliffe, however, tries to overcome this obstacle and succeeds very admirably. He is a talented young actor, and even during small facial expressions or even the tiniest piece of dialogue, you can clearly imagine what he might be feeling in the many situations in the film. You just have to look closely and that is what makes a great actor.<br/><br/>Apart from the three main stars, the supporting cast is glittering with magical talent, but director Chris Columbus does not exactly harness the power of these gifted actors. Richard Harris sleepwalks in the role of headmaster Albus Dumbledore. In the book, Dumbledore always shows sense of great excitement or energy. Here, Harris is quite tired and may even be regretting this role, after he was forced to kicking and screaming by his grandaughter. Maggie Smith as the venerable Minerva McGonagall has her share of screen time but not enough of it. Robbie Coltrane is one of the great delights of the adults as Hagrid, slipping up important plot points and possessing a heart of gold, though he never gets enough time for himself. The best adult actor is easily Alan Rickman as the sneaky, slippery Severus Snape. I could write a whole book about everything great he has done in this movie. The film is an absolute thrill ride just when he is on screen. Rickman tries to make the best of his mere five minutes total of screentime and succeeds more than the rich CGI sequences accompaning everything.<br/><br/>Which takes us to another star of this film (besides the title character of Harry): The computer-generated effects. The highlight of the movie is easily the almost completely computer-generated Quidditch match, that sport with three different kinds of balls and fourteen players on flying broomsticks. The digital effects in this sequence, I thought, were quite ahead of the other big budget blockbusters (namely Pearl Harbor and The Phantom Menace). It's not as zippy as I would've liked, like I imagined in it in the original novels, but it does the job well. The trouble with this sequence is that it is too short. Maybe a longer or even two of these scenes would've benefit the film a little bit more. Another big-scale sequence is the death-defying Chess Match. I'm sure it was amazing being on that huge set, but the scene is not much more than a bunch of minor explosions and large set pieces moving. What a wasted opportunity. I enjoyed the more subtle digital work (the enchanted ceiling particularly) as oppose to the heavy CGI scenes.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus is probably the most miss-matched director for a piece of material since Francis Ford Coppola signed on for the awful Robin William's comedy Jack. He would be the last director I'd pick for a Harry Potter movie, but he does it admirably, if not inspiringly. True, his direction for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is solid, not inspired. It's probably his best-directed movie yet, but even his view can bog the film down into a more bland status. Wouldn't it be more effective to this kind of material to hire someone like Steven Spielberg or Terry Gilliam (who was up for the directing job)? They would probably be my hand-picked directors. Still, Columbus is not bad, but he is a disappointingly bland director. He doesn't let the film breathe in it's 152 minutes (which also could've been shorter) and is too tied to his source.<br/><br/>The glaring problem in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is that though the film is advertising a magical adventure, very few ""magical"" scenes appear. In Hayao Miyazaki's animated films, 'magic' is described as real subtle element, whether it would be plucking up the spirit you lost to make things happen or even plucking up courage to stand up between the biggest of odds. In Harry Potter, most of the 'magical' scenes involve computer-generated effects. The subtle 'magic' J.K Rowling's books are standing together and trusting your friends that you can defeat all if you really believe in it. The movie is somewhat the opposite. Magic, in terms of this movie, means you must have something irregular or something odd to look at. It loses much of the subtle magic found in  countless other 'magical' films.<br/><br/>With all it's flaws, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is solid entertainment. Not even the muggle-ized vision of Chris Columbus can spoil the book's magic. J.K Rowling's characters remain intact and so do the delightful events that affect them. I was just entertained being there, with all the children (and adults alike) pointing at screen, whispering that this must be that character or how this scene looked like they thought it would be in the book. The movie does not match by vision on how the real Harry Potter should look, but that is my problem, not yours. I kind of commend the film for that."

This film is very entertaining, what with its all star cast that includes, among others, Alan Rickman, Richard Griffiths (in top form) and even John Cleese.

Atleast I would be funny). But the one out of the three main characters who impressed me the most was Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and another thing that drives me mad is the way that everyone criticises his acting.

My God, I was practically traumatized watching this. The first 30 minutes of child abuse was crushing my poor heart, and then the cake scene.  I honestly wouldn't have objected to Harry becoming a hatchet murderer at that point--you couldn't have made me side against him.

"objxs","7","0","1","29 March 2003"," Enjoyable Fun.
","I have to admit that I haven't read any of the amazingly popular novel's from which this movie came. However, after viewing this film, I am certainly tempted to do so. While this film is certainly designed for the preadolescent market, it has those necessary hooks to keep even the most hardened realist of an adult interested. <br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a young wizard, who after his parents were killed, was left with his mean and un-magical, aunt, uncle and bratty cousin who force him to live under the stairs. However, on his 11th birthday he is accepted into the Hogwart's School for young witches and wizards and enters a world of magic and mystery. While at school, he and his classmates Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) set out on a quest to find the Sorcerer's Stone (which will bring immortality to those who possess it) and to prevent an evil wizard from acquiring it.<br/><br/>Outside of the main cast of children (who are excellent); this film is chocked full with an astounding cast of British actors. Robbie Coltrane (Henry V, GoldenEye) is perfect as the lumbering and loveable giant, Rubeus Hagrid. Alan Rickman (Bob Roberts, Dogma) once again proves that he can do sinister better than any living actor. English heavyweights Richard Harris (The Guns of Navarone, Unforgiven) and Maggie Smith (Tea with Mussolini, Gosford Park) give good performances. The short appearances by John Cleese (Life of Brian, A Fish Called Wanda) and John Hurt (I Claudius) round out this superb cast.<br/><br/>The cinematography is fun and inventive with a superb use of computer special effects. The setting is a combination of gothic horror and Dickensian melodrama, which works to good effect. The story combines fairy tales of every shape and kind. From Cinderella to Greek and Roman mythologies, this movie weaves a storyline that is fun to follow. The appearance of Cerberus, the three-headed dog, now renamed as Fluffy is especially amusing.<br/><br/>Now, despite all of these good things, the fact of the matter is that this is a fluff adventure. The characters are fairly cookie-cutter with very little time given to character development. The storyline is convoluted by its attempt to juggle too many plot lines. However, it is fun to watch and I'm glad I checked it out. I may have to borrow a child so I can go watch the next one in the theatres."

It's not going to be easy filling his shoes with another actor. I also thought that if they are going to make two more films they had better hurry.

","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (bizarrely the Philosopher has transfigured himself into a Sorcerer in the USA) is a children's movie with a difference.  Thanks to the creative genius of J. K. Rowling, the judicious use of some excellent British actors, and an enormous budget, this is a film that treats its young viewers with respect.  Instead of the usual schmaltzy children's fare, Harry Potter (notwithstanding a few minor aberrations) thankfully doesn't descend into the saccharine.  On the contrary, it is a highly original and very entertaining trip into the hitherto infrequently visited realm of magic.      <br/><br/>To the many readers of the Harry Potter series of novels, the storyline will come as no surprise and the movie is very faithful to the book.  Despite prior knowledge of the plot nullifying the film's suspense somewhat, the mise-en-scene created is a veritable visual feast. The extensive use of computer animation is largely superb - the first trip across the lake to Hogwarts is awe-inspiring, Quidditch is excitingly brought to life, and the three-headed dog is certainly as scary as Rowling could have wished - although there are occasional clunky effects, such as the entrance to Diagon Alley.  The makeup too is outstanding, as evidenced by the alarmingly real goblin bankers at Gringotts. <br/><br/>Despite the movie's 2 Â½ hour length, it is relatively pacy as it follows Harry's discovery of the magician within himself, and his deadly duel with the greatest dark wizard of all time.  Together with the help of his friends Ron and Hermione he battles mountain trolls, bewitched broomsticks, and a brutal but visually stunning game of wizard's chess.  After all this excitement, the final showdown with the evil Voldemort is almost anti-climactic.  Nevertheless, overall this is a spellbinding movie - in more ways than one."

","I have yet to see part two, OR read any of the books, so that should probably be kept in mind as you read this review. I mainly focus on the acting: The older actors/actresses were grand as ever: Richard Harris (as Headmaster Dumbledore) and Maggie Smith (as Headmistress McGonagall)stand out, though Robbie Coltrane, Fiona Shaw and Alan Rickman (who is enjoyable in nearly every role he's played) do excellent jobs as well. The weak point is the children, most notably the main character, Harry Potter. Daniel Radcliffe seems unable to adequately portray emotions - he seems surprised at a few instances, but that's about the extent of it. I read that Haley Joel Osment was at one point put up as a possible Potter, and though that would've changed the largely British cast makeup, it certainly would've lead to a vastly superior acting job."

Give me an Oz book any day instead.<br/><br/>The film version's narrative is a bit choppy, the kids are downright annoying at times, pacing is uneven, and at 152 minutes it's a bit long for any tyke to watch in one sitting (my 6-8 years olds took 3-4 sittings). Over-all an average 5 out of 10; it is a nice film to watch once or twice, but don't believe the hype (surprise!).  You won't be watching this 10 years from now let alone 50...Wizard of Oz it ain't."

","For me, the book was all about Harry overcoming his self doubt, which is a struggle that we all can identify with. The movie was faithful to the narrative, but it left out Harry's struggle with self doubt. That's like doing Gone with the Wind without the Civil War. I can see why kids loved it, but with a little effort, it could have been so much better. Still, I loved seeing Diagon Alley and Hogwarts brought to life, and the actors were all terrific. So in spite of the watered-down story, the child in me was very happy. But the adult in me (45 yrs) hopes the next ones will be better."

","When the Harry Potter books first came out and began to capture the interests children and adults alike, I just brushed it off as another fad that would stay for a while and disappear without a trace. I wasn't interested in the books at all until one of my closest friends suggested that I read it. At first I declined and thought it would go against my style if I was sucked into the Potter craze. Then one day at the library, I noticed an entire shelf committed to Harry Potter books, written by the much loved author, J.K. Rowling. ""What harm could it do? I'll just read it, and then I can say 'I told you so' if i hate it."" So, I borrowed all four books, took them home, and began to read. I was in for the biggest surprise of my life. I actually liked these books! I couldn't put them down, and I though I hate being proven wrong, a little part of me was glad that I had borrowed and read these books. Then I bought all four books from BN and anticipated the upcoming movie, ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone."" After seeing the movie on the first day it came out (perhaps it was all the propaganda going around) I thought it was ""great."" I saw it twice more and began to realize this movie wasn't that great. Some of the scenes in the novel are cut out, (some of them were my favorite), and was much disappointed in that. Other than that, I didn't imagine Professor M. to be that old. Sure, I knew she was old, but not THAT old. Hagrid wasn't that bad, except he appeared to be more stupid or absent minded in the movie than he had in the book. ""I shouldn't have said that."" was repeated way too many times to receive laughter.<br/><br/>
Hermione - where's the big teeth?<br/><br/>Ron - He was ""ok"" in my comparison to the book.<br/><br/>Harry - harry was supposed to be small and skinny in the book. Maybe daniel radcliffe should lose a few pounds so he can look a bit thinner.<br/><br/>
Malfoy - In my opinion, he perfectly matched the look.<br/><br/>
It's all my opinion, but overall the movie was maybe a 5.4 out of 10, that is, if you've read the book. I didn't think it was all that great after watching it 4 times and began picking up flaws. But if you haven't read the books and plan to watch it once or twice, it'll be around 8.3 - 8.7 range. I hope the next movie will be better."
"steve.schonberger","7","0","1","20 October 2002"," A pretty good special effects showcase that loses much of the book's verbal charm
","I liked the movie, and though it did a pretty good job of presenting a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the book.  (Well, not really.  Real Cliff's Notes typically include analysis along with the synopsis that students sometimes use to avoid reading the whole book.)  For someone who has read the book, the movie is somewhat superfluous, although it is a decent effects showcase. For someone who hasn't read the book, it's a good shortcut to the story, although it misses a lot of the verbal cleverness of the book.<br/><br/>Since most people who are likely to be interested in the movie have already read the book (unless they're parents there with kids who are fans), and the movie doesn't add anything to the book in terms of storytelling, the only fair way to rate it for most viewers is on the basis of the effects.  In terms of technical craftsmanship, I thought the effects were very good, but they weren't so hot in terms of artistic creativity.  That is, the effects were mostly stuff that we've all seen before, but it was very skillfully done collection of stuff we've seen before.<br/><br/>Compared to the long history of mostly-awful fantasy movies, it's an outstanding movie, near the cream of the crop.  But since it was released in a year that also included the first Lord of the Rings movie, it looks pretty weak.  But just think how brilliant it would have looked if its main fantasy competitor had been something like the cartoon Lord of the Rings, the Dungeons and Dragons movie or Ator the Fighting Eagle.<br/><br/>(I didn't actually see the D&D movie; I was warned off by critics. But I did see Ator way back when, and then saw it again by mistake when it was re-released with a different title, and even wrote an IMDB review for it.)"

I guess it was never meant for those who are into movies about 12-year olds who have magical powers.  Too bad those powers couldn't save this movie from being horrible.  I don't know how this film could have pulled in as much money and critical acclaim as it did.  Maybe it was witchcraft then but it didn't get me to waste my money on going to see it at the theater or rent it on video.

Unfortunately my favourite character, Hermione, was not as sympathetic as in the book. Instead I prefered Draco but he didn't get as much screen time as he deserved. The ghosts were under used too & Peeves was absent entirely. Since he and the Weasley twins provide most of the humour there wasn't much to be found. I liked the moving figures in the paintings and the floating candles but again these moments were only fleeting. I didn't like the Quidditch Match but then it wasn't that interesting in the book either. I was relieved the Dursleys were cut short as they are just annoying and hateful.

I loved The Fellowship of the Ring and Spider-Man.  I was therefore surprised to be rather disappointed with the first Harry Potter movie, it was rather cold and uninvolving for me.<br/><br/>
The film seemed rather long, and towards the end I lost the thread and my interest in the film, by the end I was not really bothered whether or not I even saw it through to the finish.<br/><br/>The acting was average, despite the obvious talent the film-makers had gathered together.

Additionally, Quirrel was non-existent. there was no reason to fear him, nor Voldemort. The sense of danger must be developed in the following films. Still, I throughly enjoyed the movie."
"basrutten","6","0","1","30 July 2002"," Faithful to the book, but missing something
","For a book adaptation, ""Harry Potter and the Socerer's/Philosopher's  stone"" is a fairly good effort. It remains as faithful to the book as possible, and leaves out very little in term of story. Unfortunately, it DOES leave out most of the humour of the book (which was to be expected, you simply can't put all those funny descriptions in the movie), but it sadly doesn't replace them with much else.<br/><br/>I agree with many people that the main problem with this movie is the direction. We all know and love the story, the acting is generally good, the special effects are adequate (some shots are really fake!) etc , but it all feels so very dry, the director didn't really add his own touch to the movie, like really good directors like Tim Burton or Steven Spielberg would do. Most of the famous actors are severely underused, too.<br/><br/>
Most of this of course doesn't really matter as kids will still love this movie, but as it is, ""Harry Potter"" is more like a ""painting by numbers""- exercise, while in the right hands it could have been a Picasso."

Presumably it was done more convincingly in the book?<br/><br/>Some people have said it was too close to the book and needed to take some liberties to make it more interesting as a movie.

Director Chris Colombus is not too good at this type of film and lets us down with his nasty angles and overuse of zoom. The child acting is terrible at best, though Rupert Grint plays a satisfactory part as Ron Weasley, Harry's mate.

","I wasn't too excited to see this because I hated the books, but I rented it because there was nothing else at Blockbuster. I will keep this as simple as possible. The movie was way too long. There was almost no story line. When I first saw her, Maggie Smith looked like the woman from The Weakest Link. When we find out who the villian is, we go into the cliche ""stumble onto the real bad guy who revieles exactly how he did everything in plain, simple English."" This hasn't been seen since last year's Charlie's Angels, which made a lot more sense than this film I might add. Something in particular I didn't understand about the film, If Harry's aunt & uncle hated him so much, why don't they jump on the chance to send him away? I was not impressed with the visual effects, though I did see Lord of the Rings first. Nor was I impressed with the sound effects, or lack there of. To make a long story short, if you haven't seen this film then don't waste your time. ""It's the Wizard of Oz of its time!"" give me a break, it doesn't come remotely close!!"
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","2","17 June 2002"," Lord of the Stone!
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was released in close proximity to the great Lord of the Rings, and while this has happened many times before with the general result that one of the two films is widely, although not always correctly, considered inferior to the other (Independence Day and The Arrival, Armageddon and Deep Impact, etc.), this has surprisingly not been the case with these films. Clearly, The Lord of the Rings is a much more mature and bold film, but the first installment in the Harry Potter series is much more than a childish adventure tale. One of the things that really makes it a great film is that the film is so faithful to the book. The writers and director Chris Columbus wisely decided not to take any creative liberties with the material that they had to work with. I am glad to see this, because literary faithfulness is almost always associated with better adapted films, and it's good to know that no one involved with the making of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone felt the need to improve upon a book that has been justifiably described as a `publishing phenomenon.'<br/><br/>J.K Rowling has created a brilliant adventure masterpiece with her first novel, which she reportedly began writing in some café in England back when she was a struggling single mother, and Chris Columbus has successfully taken on the daunting task of bringing it to the screen. One of the things that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has in common with The Lord of the Rings is that they both bring the audience to entirely new worlds, with the added bonus in Harry Potter that we actually start out in the real world (to some extent) and travel to the world of witches and wizards with the equally amazed Harry Potter.<br/><br/>On a structural level, Harry Potter takes an age-old underdog winning formula and reformulates it to make it interesting again. We get a surprisingly simple version of the good vs. bad structure that Star Wars exemplifies so well as Harry faces off with his pals in Griffindor against the obviously malicious Draco Malfoy (what a name!) and the rest of Slytherin. There is a surprising amount of characterization going on in this film even at the level of their actual names, to such extent that a couple of Draco's loyal goons have names like Crabbe and Goyle. Real charmers, I'm sure.<br/><br/>Obviously, in a film with this much fantasy and adventure, there is a definite need for some amount of computer-generated special effects. You just can't have a fight with a fully-grown mountain troll or a game of Quidditch played on broomsticks or a lot of the magic that took place in the movie without them, but thankfully they were wise enough not to take the special effects too far, a mistake the ease of which to make George Lucas is happily proving. The problem with computer-generated images these days is that no matter how huge the budget is or how high tech the images are, they NEVER look completely real. Chris Columbus seems to realize this, as can be seen, for example, in the Quidditch game, in which all of the players zooming around on their brooms are generally shown from a distance, so that the only way that we can tell that they aren't real, with a few exceptions, is that we've never seen someone in real life riding a flying broom. Given the fact that a game played entirely on flying brooms was made to look at least moderately convincing, we're more than willing to forgive the relatively few scenes in which the level of reality slips a little bit (such as the scene where the mountain troll is hanging Harry by his foot, swinging at him with his club).<br/><br/>The casting in the film, as well, could not possibly have been better. 12 year-old Daniel Radcliffe perfectly captures the unique character of Harry Potter, and his young friends in the film are portrayed by a series of preteen newcomers as well. The surprising thing here is not only that most of the children with lead roles in the film are very new to film acting, but that Chris Columbus managed to coax such convincing performances out of all of them (obviously, being fans of wonderful adventure tales such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, we all remember director Richard Donner mentioning in the director's commentary on The Goonies DVD that working with children made him contemplate suicide on a daily basis). Robbie Coltrane delivers the performance of his career as the lovable Hagrid, the gigantic Gamekeeper with the heart of gold and the clumsily loose tongue, while Richard Harris and Maggie Smith fit so well in their roles that they seem to have been written specifically for them (each easily reaching the incredible level of precision with which Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee each fit into their respective roles in The Lord of the Rings). And, of course, I can't forget Alan Rickman, who is so perfectly cast as Severus Snape that the role could not have been filled half as well by any other actor. Rickman has been unfortunately typecast since his absolutely brilliant performance in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and his role here as Snape is hardly a notch or two below that one. <br/><br/>Clearly, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is aimed at a relatively younger audience, since the books are aimed at a young adult audience, but the film manages to entertain children and adults alike, just as the books are easily enjoyable by any adult who is at least slightly in touch with his or her inner child. It is not often that a book or series of books as fascinating as the Harry Potter books comes along, and it's great to see that, just like The Lord of the Rings, the series is off to a smashing good start. I wish they would make movies out of some of the other adventure books that are just as fun to read as the Harry Potter books, such as The Phantom Tollbooth or The Chronicles of Narnia (someone's sitting on a gold mine with that one!!), but for now, I am personally more than content to sit back and watch a new Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings film for the next couple years, and hope that this trend of quality adventure will continue in the future."

Aside from Alan Rickman (who is always excellent as a villain) and the rather good acting from the young couple Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, all the rest of the cast was utter hogwash (hey, wasn't that the name of the main setting, the school?). Worst of all the cast (I wouldn't want to draw shame upon the acting community by calling this bunch actors) was the shrunken version of John Lennon, a.k.a. Daniel Radcliffe.

","So far, the film has been well received by its young fans and most critics. Some critics and myself are less enthusiastic. Indeed, a friend of mine who has read the book was quick to point out that it was made simpler and more childish. If only director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves had done their jobs as well as the set designers, cast and visual effects people, this would have been the film of the year. As it stands, it is reduced to a moderately entertaining diversion which probably doesnt even warrant cinematic viewing. And to think it began so well, showing strong signs of plot development. Sadly, it starts to go downhill not long after Harry arrives at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>I do not blame the actors. To be honest, they cant really do too much with their characters, for the screenplay never allows us to feel enough sympathy for them. Daniel Radcliffe is a credible Harry, while Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) show plenty of promise. However, Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) is the best performer in the film. John Cleese has a (very funny) small supporting part. Alan Rickman is also pretty convincing, though Ive seen better from him. Richard Harris is fine, and there are also appearances from more famous supporting players such as Maggie Smith and Julie Walters.<br/><br/>The film is not without its great moments. The Quidditch game is NOT one of them though. The scene with the magic mirror, however, does standout. But the moment the story surrounding the stone begins, things begin to slide. Its not that the storyline isnt detailed, its just not exciting enough. There are surprises, but there seem to be less of those than predictable resolutions. To add insult to injury, the musical score is just as bland as some of the films characters. <br/><br/>Visually, the film succeeds. Columbus has recreated Harry Potters world in a very appealing way, and many of the best scenes feature the use of visual effects. When the plot doesnt hold your interest, the effects and scenery do.<br/><br/>For all this films flaws, it still has the capacity to entertain many, notably its child fans. Despite that, I still hope the probable sequel is much better."

","This one was a serious disappointment.<br/><br/>I admit that the designs, costumes and the cast were quite good, but there was almost nothing of the book in there. It seems to me that guy who wrote the script thought of nothing but the visual effects. He made a checklist of the scenes in the book and checked it off. You can almost hear the pencil scratching the checkmark while watching the movie. The characters are flat, unlike that in the book and there is no development.<br/><br/>The visual effect are quite good, but they make the film nothing better. I shudder to think what these people make out of the second and third book. They are much much darker than the first and there is much less comical relief.

","I put off seeing this movie for a long time because i was real fan of the books and i thought the movie might ruin the story....i was right.<br/><br/>A major problem that i see with the movie is that so many parts of the story are missed out that i can't see how you can follow it without the book, but if you have read the book then it will annoy you when you notice parts of the story that are missing or changed.<br/><br/>The start of the story is rushed and when harry does find out he's a wizard he has virtually no reaction as if he was expecting it. In fact the whole story in my opinion is rushed and no time was taken up to build atmosphere so in the end it didn't seem to really matter what happened.<br/><br/>The casting of the lead roles was also terrible, in the book Ron is described as being tall and lanky and growing out of his robes, but in the film he is short and fits all his clothes perfectly, Harry also seems wrong, in the book he is described as small and skinny with untidy hair, but in the film he isn't really very small or skinny and has perfect hair, Hermione is described as goofy and having large teeth, but the casters inevitably cast a nice pretty girl who will look good in the later movies, this is the same with many of the other characters. Also most of the main characters have lovely home counties accents, with the exception of the dumb Neville, the groundskeeper Hagrid and a couple of Irish guys they chucked in there for political correctness. This film was obviously cast for an american audience with their stereotypes of British accents, what about the rest of the UK or are they not allowed into Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Hopefully the next film will be better at creating a story rather than just picking his favourite parts of the book and hoping the audience can fill in the gaps. The damage has already been done with the casting, but maybe they'll do better next time with the future characters that are introduced."
"il_matto","7","0","1","18 July 2002"," Read the book first.
","To put it bluntly, the film doesn't do the book justice.<br/><br/>
That's certainly not the fault of the actors involved, all of whom do a good job - or, in the case of the perfectly cast Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane in particular, an excellent job. Other acting heavyweights like Maggie Smith and Richard Harris bring necessary wisdom and presence to their roles, while obviously having fun playing the characters. Ian Hart makes a wonderful Quirrell. Daniel Radcliffe is well-cast in the title role, and it will be interesting to see how he develops the character in future movies. In general, the cast is well chosen and works well together.<br/><br/>It's a pity that Chris ""Home Alone"" Columbus was chosen to direct, and not someone like Terry Gilliam, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, or Tim Burton... all much more imaginative directors, who could fully bring the wonder of the novel to life onscreen. To be fair, as another viewer commented, Columbus restrains himself from the outlandish slapstick for which he's known. <br/><br/>The problem with turning a book into a movie is that things like character development often suffer, as is the case here. Without the benefit of getting into Harry's head as we do on the written page, the story seems less gripping. <br/><br/>While certainly not unwatchable or even bad, it's definitely missing some... well, some of the magic of the book (sorry) as well as a lot of its wit. The performances and the visual effects make up for a bit of that, leading to a rating of 7/10."

","Whilst I'd obviously heard of Harry Potter I only read the books a couple of weeks before the film and read them all in a week - not a good idea as you spot the 'formulaic' aspects.<br/><br/>Unlike most films, the director knew before release he would have a smash box office film due to the immense fan base the character had from the books.  However because of this he also had to make sure he stuck to the book and I have to say he did, almost like glue.  And that, for me, was my main problem as there was no real ""Wow"" factor.  Whilst I was struck by the amazingly well constructed sets and the visualisations of the various locations in the book, I always knew what was going to happen next and because the main themes of the book were so closely followed, as was much of the dialogue, I never experienced the frisson of excitement you can get when you think ""what's going to happen next?"".<br/><br/>This isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I did very much.  The characters were faithful to the book as were the locations but as I said, that was the main problem - no Wow!.  I'm not really blaming the director for this, in my opinion he would have found it extremely hard to introduce any changes and in making a film that the book fans loved he achieved his aim.<br/><br/>So whilst I would say that the film is technically excellent the lack of deviation in the story was both its strength and its weakness.<br/><br/>[ I also thought that changing the title for US audiences from Philosopher to Sorcerer because 'they wouldn't know what a philosopher was'  was an insult to that audience.]"

"taikman","7","0","1","4 April 2002"," Faithful and attractive adaption that lacks real spark.
","If ever there was proof of that cliche 'it's never as good as your imagination', this movie is it. It looks wonderful, has some great scenes and the casting is very good, but it does not match the charm, atmosphere and cleverness of the book. Ironically, you may very well enjoy it more if you've never read J.K Rowling's world famous novel, as I and some others who've seen it found it hard to get into the film, as we were watching it with half an eye for how accurately it fitted our visions rather than enjoying it purely for itself. <br/><br/>The film's lacks can be summed up by a paradox: it is both too true and not true enough to the book. The film is a bit disjointed, with the changes between scenes not being as smooth as they could be, and I think this is because it is trying to follow the plot of the book as exactly as it could. The problem is that books and films are two different media, and what works in one will not necessarily work in the other. The film does not (and probably cannot, as the books do not have a narrator that the film could use) have the hidden voice of the author to fill in the gaps in the plot and add those little satirical touches that helped make the book so enjoyable for adults as well as children. This means that there are parts of the film that do not have the punch they do in the novel: for example the early scenes dealing with Harry's appalling foster parents are good, but they do not quite convey the wretchedness of Harry's 'normal' life as they do in the book, and despite Alan Rickman's disdainful drawl, Professor Snape is not as nasty as I imagined him. As a result there is not the tension surrounding whether Harry will get kicked out of the school and why it's so important that Snape's house Slytherin doesn't win the trophy. Perhaps this explains why parts of the film seem rather flat.<br/><br/>The other significant problem I had with the film was that Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry Potter, does not have the energy and fun that the character does in the novel. He's not bad, and he does look very like I imagined Harry Potter to, but he seems a bit passive. Other than that the acting was pretty spot on - Robbie Coltrane is particularly good as Hagrid and the actors playing the teachers and the other kids all do an excellent job.<br/><br/>The film's strengths are many and far outweigh it's weaknesses: some things are even better than I saw them in my head: Hogwarts looks magnificent in it's Gothic wierdness, the invisibility cloak is indeed very cool, the chess match is brutally satisfying and, most impressively, the Quidditch match is a triumph: full of hurtling broomsticks, violent collisions and flying bodies. It's like a cross between rugby and basketball in mid-air, and it rocks. The story is obviously a very good one and, while it isn't as scary as the book, it's good and dark for a movie aimed at kids as well as adults. I enjoyed it, and might enjoy it more on a second viewing, when it doesn't have the baggage of living up to a modern classic. <br/><br/>RATING 7/10."
"johnnymonsarrat","5","0","1","1 April 2002"," Jon Monsarrat review: generic and boring
","""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a great film for kids in the same way that a lot of generic fiction is great for kids. They are too young to know that many of the themes in Harry Potter have been done to death in other fantasy books and (to an extent) movies.<br/><br/>To make it worse, two factors. One, Harry is a bit of an anti-hero because things happen to him rather than he taking the lead. Additionally, bits and pieces of the book are placed in the movie in a way which builds quite a meandering plot for someone who hasn't read the book. The game of air hockey ""quiddich"", and learning to fly the brooms are two examples. The overall theme of the Harry Potter series (as I have been told by friends) is that Harry is a little boy who finds himself, grows up and discovers greatness. That theme is 100% lost in the film.<br/><br/>If you didn't rave over ""LadyHawke"" or ""Labyrinth"", or more recently, ""Final Fantasy"" or ""Jumanji"", you probably won't rave over Harry Potter. Arty types who've been listening to all the hype and considering going should note that the film didn't win any Oscars. Harry Potter is a world apart from Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Fantasy buffs -- I won't be able to dissuade you so I won't try,<br/><br/>but don't bring your SO, instead take him/her to LOTR.<br/><br/>-- Kids and adults with kids who have built up a tolerance<br/><br/>to kid stuff<br/><br/>-- Sci-fi buffs who either love computer graphics or have<br/><br/>nothing better to do on a rainy day.<br/><br/>I'll give Harry Potter and The Sorceror's Stone a 5 out of 10.

I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>It has all the elements children love: empowerment especially over adults; secret passageways; cryptic messages and meanings; camaraderie with close friends (especially as a surrogate family); and the occasional monster. But besides all that, I found it to be enjoyable magical fun, and I too got swept up in the adventure, and in the whimsy of such as a secret street for wizards and magicians.<br/><br/>Of course, the school villains are two-dimensional at best, and we've seen their like going back to ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"". This is the weakest element of the script.<br/><br/>I do have to wonder about all the wizardry and witchcraft in a world devoid of God resulting in one way tickets to Hell for all of them.

The events became hard to follow; for example, whatever game that Harry and his peers played, it was NOT well explained, and I'm sitting in the theater wondering, ""what is the point?"" And again, at the end when the three friends go off to do... well, whatever the point was. I didn't understand WHY they were doing anything they did - it all seemed very unsupported. But again, I'll admit that might be my fault, because towards the end (heck, even the middle), I found myself fighting to pay attention. I don't see how everyone else sat through this droning bore. And what the hell is with everyone saying the special effects are great? They're not even decent. In fact, the scene with the monster in the bathroom -- that was TERRIBLE.

I did finally go to see it today, only because I had a request to make a Harry Potter costume for somebody for Halloween...so I had to check it out. I was also curious to see the ""famous"" Harry Potter...and check out the film that is up against Fellowship of the Ring for an Oscar in Art Direction, Music Score and Costume Design. Sounds as if I might be a bit biased against Harry Potter already doesn't it? I'll admit I was. But don't jump to conclusions yet....<br/><br/>After seeing the film I can say that on some levels I enjoyed it. It was a wonderful, albeit too long, children's film. I liked most of the characters, but especially Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I think Daniel Radcliffe did a fine job as Harry and enjoyed Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. I told my husband after the movie that I would have enjoyed it immensely had I been 10 years old. I found the first half (at least) of the movie to be incredibly slow, as if it were setting up the plot to come. The plot was slow too...too much concentration on the details of Hogwarts instead of developing the story IMO. FX weren't all that great if you ask me (particularly the end with Lord Voldemart-spelling?-I found it rather cheesy, not to mention the troll. Speaking of the troll, I recall someone telling me that the troll in the Fellowship fo the Rings was probably copied from HP&SS...ehem...well, while I found the troll in FOTR rather lacking, it was much better than the one in HP. He reminded me of Shrek!<br/><br/>The music was one of the high points in my opinion...it was the most magical touch to the movie. It fit perfectly most of the time and wasn't too overpowering for the most part.<br/><br/>The costume design was OK, but it was well rather costumey. It didn't feel real, yet I'm not sure it was suppose to. I think this film is intended to be pure fantasy...childlike fantasy. HP was good light entertainment, enought to take you away for an afternoon, granted you have comfortable theatre seats...it seemed to drag on.<br/><br/>As far as my seeing it to assess the competition Fellowship of the Ring has for an Oscar...I would think the FOTR has nothing to worry about from HP.

","I don't consider myself a huge Harry Potter fan - still, I've read all the books and enjoyed them a great lot. I was quite anxious to see how well was the atmosphere of the books translated to the big screen. I'm sorry to join the displeased side, but the movie IS disappointing - to say the least.<br/><br/>Its main asset seems to be the way all the familiar locations are portrayed - Diagon Alley, Gringotta Bank, platform 9 and 3/4, finally the majestic Hogwarts itself are all visually stunning and wonderfully brought to life. I have no complaints about actors' performances either - with Emma Watson as Hermione, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Alan Rickman as Snape doing particularly well.<br/><br/>Alas, for the rest of the movie... Following the original story it is - logical it is not. There are far too many bits missing to make it sensible. Where's the constant competition of the houses? How come Snape doesn't take points from Gryffindor on every occasion? Why is Malfoy nearly absent throughout? What's the point of having Crabbe and Goyle or the centaur appear on the screen if they have absolutely nothing to do there? I couldn't even see any mention of Professor McGonagall being the head of the Gryffindor House! And most of all - where has the Snape's potion riddle gone? It makes the entire ending feel incomplete and unsatisfying.<br/><br/>While I realize it's plain impossible to transcript ALL the details from the book, many humorous ones COULD have been included if it hadn't been for the irritating exploding wands gags, Neville's broomstick exploits or some overdrawn conversations. Even the great scene in Olivander's wand shop was rewritten and ruined for a bunch of cheap chuckles.<br/><br/>And to all those saying the effects were great - where have you guys been for the last couple of years? I mean, c'mon! The quidditch match is way too fast and chaotic - makes me wonder what are they going to do when it's time to shoot the World Cup match in ""Goblet of Fire"", which is supposed to be played MUCH FASTER than anything Harry had ever seen! At the same time the effects are lousy, including the most obvious blue screens I've seen in months and flying broomsticks that make ""Back To The Future Part II"" look top notch in comparison - and that's a 1989 title, mind you. The troll was laughable and shrekish to the point of incredulousness. The stiff dummy pretending to be Neville falling off the broomstick was embarrassing. And since ""Forrest Gump"" there's hardly anything impressive about a feather hovering in mid-air.<br/><br/>The camerawork is merely average. Having seen how splendid the castle of Hogwarts looks from outside I expected the same kind of grandeur inside. Sadly, apart from the few scenes in the Great Hall, they never manage to convey the sheer size of the place. And excuse me, was that supposed to be the dreary dank dungeon where the potions classes took place? Give me a break.<br/><br/>All in all - an big effort, but with half its potential lost somewhere on the way. Could have been so much more. This - 6/10, tops."

","The only reason I went to see this movie was because my girlfriend gave me no other option.  However, once I got to the theater, I was really in the mood to try to open my mind up and let this movie capture my attention.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately it never did.  Granted, I am not big into dungeons and dragons, witchcraft, sorcerers or wizards, but that didn't stop me from really enjoying Lord of the Rings.  So that proves that I am *capable* of enjoying a night out watching a movie such as this, however Harry Potter just didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>I don't know if was just the main character, Harry Potter, that turns me off or what, but I must say that he surely didn't help matters.  He seemed to be nothing but a ""do-gooder"" who is a brainiac but yet the athletic ""braveheart"" of the movie.  Yea right, ummm ok.<br/><br/>By the time the movie was over, I was dying to get out of the theater. Had it gone on for even 10 more minutes I think I would have had a nervous breakdown trying to hide my discontent from my girlfriend.<br/><br/>
After the movie I just wrote it off as me not liking it due to the idea that I'll never like a fantasy movie with wizardry in it.  However since seeing Lord of the Rings, I now know it isn't just me, as I loved that one.  I guess I just don't like the character Harry Potter, thus making it hard to like the movie, Harry Potter.  And by the way, no I never read the books about Harry Potter, and now I doubt I ever will."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Harry who?  I must admit I have never read any of J.K. Rowling's apparently delightful Harry Potter novels.  I always understood that they were for. well, children.  Which was why I couldn't really understand all the hype surrounding the movie.  To be honest, it wasn't until a few months ago, when every magazine on the shelf was covered with Harry Potter's gleaming mug, when I decided I better sit up and take notice.  And that I did.<br/><br/>
Commercials, trailers, previews, behind-the-scenes pull-out guides were appearing everywhere and, all this while, whoever was sitting next to me at the time would be wearing an enormously excited, genuine grin.  All I could do was feign interest. and grin.  The truth is, I wasn't interested. Just. curious.  Then reviews and box-office results started to filter out - it was an immediate success!  With everyone!  Critics and viewers alike.  I had to see it. didn't I?  Not really actually.  The truth is, if you doubt you'll be interested, you probably won't, or at least you should go in not expecting film of the year.  Like I did (lowers head in shame).<br/><br/>
This is a children's movie.  Which apparently means bad acting, predictable dialogue and lots of standing around and screaming, before running around for another few minutes (Home Alone fashion).  Is that what children's movies are all about?  Just making a film worse than it could be? Apparently.  I keep saying 'apparently', because if that's what the rest of the world think, then I'm not going to argue with them.  But hang on, wasn't 'The Lion King' a children's movie?  Wasn't the updated version of 'Miracle on 34th Street' primarily for kids at Christmas?  The difference between these and 'Harry Potter' is there is something to enjoy for everyone. They work on more than one level.  'Harry Potter' doesn't.  The characters are merely bold, stereotyped, completely undeveloped people, acting very, very flatly with little or no enthusiasm.<br/><br/>But hang on, it's a children's movie. SO WHAT?!?!  It shouldn't make a single bit of difference to the actual quality.  OK, so characters can be excused for lack of depth, but surely this should be made up for in superficial acting qualities like timing and charisma.  Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid) manages.  Unfortunately the majority of the cast don't and end up looking like people straight out of a British Sunday afternoon children's series.<br/><br/>Should the title character really be so. plain?  Am I meant to be behind him, cheering him on, hoping he does well?  Sorry, I must have forgot to be. Daniel Radcliffe simply isn't cute enough - he's too mature.  I know this is meant to be an example of his strong persona, but it just means I never feel sorry for him or never want him to succeed.  He feels too untouchable, like James Bond or Indiana Jones, who to my knowledge, both surpass the age of eleven by some length.  This, however, is the director's (Chris Columbus) fault and not Radcliffe's.  At the beginning of the film we are shown Harry's Uncle and Aunt and how their outrageous neglect of him has seriously effected him.  Or not.  In fact, it doesn't appear that he could care less that he sleeps in a cupboard below the stairs.  Harry doesn't look starved, over-worked or neglected, he just looks like a normal kid and the only thing frightening about his Aunt and Uncle is that they appear to have both fallen straight out of every single children's series ever made.  OK, so they're caricatures, they don't need to be strongly developed characters, but I tired overly quick of their unoriginal personalities as I had seen it so many times before.<br/><br/>This is also how the majority of the characters in the film functioned; merely there to serve their purpose and act pantomimic.  As a children's novel, J.K Rowling may have described them like this, which no doubt probed the imagination of children into creating such fun and lively characters, but in my opinion, on the screen, it doesn't work.<br/><br/>All of the child actors do a decent job to distinguish their relationships early on, but Chris Columbus' direction does nothing to elevate them above the average mark; and if Ron Weasley (played by Rupert Grint) does that weird little sideways smirk one more time, I'm going to scream.<br/><br/>
Nobody in the film has quite enough 'umph' to show us what they're meant to be; Harry and co aren't quite likeable enough and had I not been bombarded with so much pre-performance information I probably wouldn't have guessed that Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) was meant to be the villain.  Just to add another nail in the coffin of unprofessional film-making, the children even appeared to nearly forget their lines on several occasions, as their sentences drew to a hesitant end; which, quite frankly, I cannot understand since half the time I knew what they were going to say before they even opened their mouths.<br/><br/>The only child who impressed me was the young Emma Watson who played Hermione Granger; she somehow managed to be likeable and irritating at once. The adult actors don't do a much better job with the aforementioned Robbie Coltrane being the only one who seems to be comfortable with his role; even the usually brilliant, Alan Rickman, disappointed me.<br/><br/>'Disappointed' seems to summarise the whole experience for me.  With all the hype surrounding the film it's difficult not to be disappointed.  But, oh my, were there many things to disappoint me.  In this day and age I expect to see a higher quality of special effects in a film, especially in one with such a huge budget.  Remember in the 1950's films where you'd see a shot inside a car and it would be obvious they were actually in a studio and not really on the open road?  Well it seems Chris Columbus thought he'd go back to using that effect for the broomstick scenes.  Oh no, a troll has broken free from the dungeon!  But he's not real, he's a computer image.  One so blatantly a computer image that I'm surprised the children fell for it. What? He's supposed to be 'real'?  But he looks so cartoony and two-dimensional.  OK, well what about the part where they were all playing a sports game on the PlayStation?  What was that, it wasn't a computer game? They were meant to be playing a magical sport called 'Quidditch'?  Oh right. I'll be blunt again - it didn't look real by a long stretch and it sounded like there was a crowd of 200,000 even though there was obviously only about 200 children in there.<br/><br/>Having said that, the game of 'Quidditch' was actually one of the more exciting parts of the film.  It was fast, fun and for once I couldn't guess what was coming next. well, sort of.  As the scene progressed, it became more and more like every sport's film ever made where we are forced to feel uplifted and behind the losing side (the good side), but it did go creepily clichÃ© by suddenly cutting to Coltrane's character who was cheering them on: `Yeah, go on, you can do it!' I think his words were, or something else which made him look as equally uncomfortable.<br/><br/>But it didn't really matter, because it entertained the viewer's and most importantly, the kids, and this is what the film was all about.  But this is all it did do, which I personally think is a very easy feat.  Ironically, for a film all about magic, it didn't quite have enough movie magic; something which, if possessed, can literally turn a bad movie into a work of art (e.g. Star Wars).  But it had just about enough to do the business; just enough charm to make me smile; just enough interesting set-pieces for me to never really get bored or look at my watch; just enough. of everything. It did what it had to do and nothing more.<br/><br/>'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (or Philosopher's Stone as it's called in Britain)' is a film which must have something that really hits a magical nerve in many movie-goers, otherwise the film would not have been so critically and commercially well-received.  Unfortunately, it missed mine. I enjoyed the experience, but was basically disappointed and frustrated to find not a cinematic masterpiece, but a technically average and underwhelming film.  Of this year's main movies, Harry Potter is not one that will live in the hearts and memories of viewers and the bizarre comparison between this and 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is utterly unfounded.  In my opinion, there is no comparison.<br/><br/>An ultimately disappointing experience that was fairly fun and enjoyable while it lasted, but never really went that bit further.  One for the kids. Now, I'm off to make a children's film.  Which means I'll have a few heroic kids; a mean kid who is fatter than the rest and picks his nose and stuff like that; a bad guy who is actually quite nice and a good guy who is actually quite bad.  Sound good?  Didn't think so.<br/><br/>6/10 (3*/5)"

Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the film, and would recommend others to go and see it, but - possibly because of all the hype - I was disappointed.<br/><br/>I found it much less engaging that the books. There were lovely elements - particularly the backgrounds - pictures etc, but for me, there was none of the soul that the books have - and it was largely missing the sly humour. The books have an edge that the film was lacking, I found some of the actors were ""distant"" - reading the roles rather than acting them. The film also felt choppy - with no real sense of development, it seemed to just jump from one incident to the next.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed by the marginalisation of many of the characters who are important in the book - particularly the rest of the Weasleys and Malfoy. I know that there are time constraints in a film, but there could have been more characterisation and less eye-candy, especially in an adaptation of such a superbly characterised book.<br/><br/>Summary - not a bad evenings viewing, but I, for one, would rather re-read the books. 5/10"

I personally need something more in a movie before it really impresses me, and before it deserves such tremedous glorification as Harry Potter seems to be recieving.

","Clearly there is a dearth of literature in this country.  I sat down to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone expecting a prime example of children's literature - what I got was a good story residing in a mediocre book.  It was something akin to the novellas of Robin Cook.  J.K. Rowling seems to have been given the tremendous gift of imagination.  She creates a whole world outside our own to show us how Harry Potter learns to be a wizard, unfortunately, she lacks the grasp of the language required to turn her imaginings into a great work of children's literature.  She is not to be blamed for it as it is a very rare gift, shared by greats such as Roald Dahl and in a different way, Dr. Seuss.<br/><br/>It is my honest opinion the movie was substantially better than the book. In most cases, the written word provides enough details to give the reader a clear image of what the author intended, leaving just enough to the imagination to allow the reader to create as scary, loving, ugly, or intense image as s/he chooses, this book did not.  In the case of Harry Potter, Rowling provides too much detail in some places and not enough in others. Had this been written for a creative writing class, the instructor would no doubt have used up copious amounts of ink requesting that Rowling ""show, not tell.""  The imagination of the movie maker must work differently.  Those who create works for film are charged with dazzling the audience with their imaginations.  Columbus succeeds in taking all the details from the book and making them larger than what had been put down in words by the author. Hagrid, the Quidditch match, the portraits on the walls all are crafted by Columbus with a view that seems to reach into the depths of J.K. Rowlings mind and extract all of the glory of what she was imagining, but failed to put down on paper.<br/><br/>The cast was remarkable as Alan Rickman and Richard Harris were both perfect for the roles in which they were cast and their performances were marvelous, as always.  The other adult actors and the children all performed at top level as well.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I can certainly recommend this movie to virtually anyone. Their is only one word of caution.  Read the book first, you won't enjoy the book once you have seen the film."
"shaid","7","0","1","15 January 2002"," An OK film, nothing more.
","*SPOILERS*  *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS*<br/><br/>The makers of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone encountered 3 obstacles when adapting the book to the big screen.<br/><br/>1. A very popular book. An adaptation should satisfied the many people who read the book.<br/><br/>2. A very control writer. J.K. Rowling knew exactly how she wanted the film to look like and was not going to let anyone destroy her work.<br/><br/>3. The book is a set-up. The basic setting and main characters are described in details and will not be described any more. Other were briefly mentioned and will be dealt later.<br/><br/>With these 3 obstacles in mind, can anyone be surprise that everyone involved in the project have chosen an faithful adaptation for the book. And while this approach has solved the first 2 obstacles . It only solved half of the 3rd one. Things that were dealt in the book were ignored in the film and would have to be dealt in later films. With a limit time of running for a film I can not see how they are going to do this.(but this is more a problem for the makers and not for me). But even the most faithful adaptation is bound to have changes. Changes are inevitable and here there are no exception. There are changes and I found three of these changes to suggest that the book has not been carefully read or that Rowling's control was not always at best.<br/><br/>1. The scene in the zoo - At this stage in his life Harry Potter is not aware that he is a wizard. The way the scene is written and directed seem to suggest the opposite. It makes Harry's reaction late a little illogic.<br/><br/>2. The riddles on the way to the stone - There are many riddles, each represent a teacher. Some of them disappeared on the way to the big screen. But there are three which are important. The 1st involve the flying keys. This one represent Harry's strength in being a Seeker in Quidditch. The 2nd involve a live chess game. This one represent Ron Weasley's strength in that game. He is the best player. The 3rd involve potions. This one represent Hermione Granger's strength in logic and show how sharp her mind is. The whole way to the stone also show that our 3 hero's have to work together in order to solve everything. Alone they can not make it. For some reason Hermione's riddle has disappeared from the film and to add insult to injury Professor Dumbledore mention her riddle at the end of the year feast. Confusing to say the least. If you have read the book, you will know what he is talking about. If not you can only guest.<br/><br/>3. Harry's confrontation with Voldemort - Harry's reaction to Professor Quirrell come from instincts. The film turns him into a murderer and with no consequences. Not the message I'd like children to see.<br/><br/>I was missing 2 other aspects of the book. Harry's life at The Dursleys doesn't look as bad as it was described in the book and I didn't get the sense of a school which in the book is very much part of the book.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus is an adequate director. He doesn't have the ability or the vision to give the material an extra bonus. He directed the film according to the book , no extras. In his decision to be faithful to the book he ignored the fact that the book  and the film are 2 different mediums and that there is a place for changes that will reflect that fact. John Williams' music is good and serve the film well. The cast, with no exception is good, but some of them could be use more. I am very glad that all actors were English and that it was filmed in England. It kept the spirit of the book intact. <br/><br/>There were 2 scenes that were better than the rest of the film The Quidditch game(too short and not enough) and the live  chess gane towards the end of the film. If only the rest of the film was like that we might have a better film.<br/><br/>This is not a bad film nor is it an excellent one. It rank as an OK film. I do think that people who have never read the book will enjoy from it more than people who have read the book. And after the film they will run to read the book, which is good. It is shame though. The book had the potential for a good movie but the result is less than expected."

I realize that you can't film the book entirely, but that doesn't mean that some vital scenes have to be cut out ?<br/><br/>Snape, for instance, was far to 'friendly', he never even took any Griffindor points!

So they all went to see this wonderful movie together, so I just had to go. <br/><br/>To tell you the truth, it is a pretty good magical tale about a boy who is destined to be the ultimate of wizards. In my opinion, though, the movie seemed to hop along like a chocolate frog, it seemed disjointed to me. It's almost as if there are certain defined 'chapters' that have been plopped down right out of the book. It needed to flow a little better if you know what I mean.

","As the Harry Potter film swoops into the top 5 highest grossing films of all time it seems clear that Chris Columbus has achieved what both Warner Bros and himself set out to do, to make a blockbuster that could appeal, like the books, to both kids and adults across the globe.<br/><br/>Within 5 minutes of the film beginning it is clear that Columbus is playing it safe, however in his attempt to stay true to the book he fails to produce a film that is either magical, such as Peter Jackson has achieved with The Lord of the Rings, or produce a work which captures the spirit and emotion of Rowling's creation.<br/><br/>The film manages to recreate some scenes from the book almost to the letter, whilst at the same time completely missing out ones which are far more important. The tone and focus also seems wrong, and unlike the books there is far more emphasis on the Indiana Jones style machinations of Harry and Voldemort that on Harry's desperate attempts to fit into a world which he never knew existed, with the threat of a return to his previous life hanging over him.<br/><br/>On the acting front Daniel Radcliffe is solid if occasionally wooden as Harry, but the show is stolen by the superb performances of the other two child stars. Rupert Grint pulls off Ron Weasley entirely convincingly, as does Emma Watson as Hermione. The performances of Maggie Smith, Richard Harris and Alan Rickman are all up to their usual high standard, and Robbie Coltrane is perfect as Hagrid, almost as if he had walked off the pages of the book itself.<br/><br/>In conclusion the film is good, but it could have been so much more, if Columbus had either been willing to take more of a risk and really produced some magic."

I get a rush of excitement when I know that what I'm about to read is new and full of amazing characters, places and ideas. That's what ""Harry Potter"" is - a land full of magical brilliance where you can let your mind wander - it's incredible. Now you wonder how a movie can live up to that? Well I have to say that it is exactly what I expected - which is a lot. It lives up to its counterpart and  passes with flying colours. Everything is how I imagined it to be down to the very last piece of chicken on the plates at the feasts. This movie is a trip to your imagination and could not be better!"

","***some spoilers<br/><br/> Well, I've seen two films in the last 2 weeks, Lord of the Rings, and this, and had exactly the opposite reacitons. I read LOTR a year ago, and hated it, and only saw the movie on friends' reccomendations - and loved it. I read Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone about a year ago, and loved it. I saw the film, and hated every minute of it.<br/><br/> My key problem is the child actors. The actors for the teachers are mostly very good, especially Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape) and wotsit the flying teacher. However, though in the books the characters were well formed, and were believable enough that you could identify them and feel for them to an extent, the characters in the film feel terribly like they're just reading lines, and never really got inside the character. Another problem is that a lot of the scenes involving all of the children have been largely rewritten for some reason, and now feel like they come from the 1920s! A good example is when Harry first meets Draco Malfoy. Malfoy speaks like a gangster being threatening and ominous, not like a school bully! I'm sure this wasn't the case in the books. Another example is the way that some characters, especially all the Weasleys, act like they're 4 years younger than their ages. Fred and George especially - they're supposed to be 13/14, but act like prepubescent mischief makers which I thought were dead and buried when Enid Blyton stopped writing!<br/><br/> Other than the actors, I have just one other qualm: that so much was chopped from the plot which described how it was worked out that someone was after the stone, that it seems that they simply pluck the idea out of thin air. In the book, this is believable, because there is enough compelling evidence that this is the case, whereas in the film the evidence amounts to a suspicion and a dog bite on someone's knee. Hardly convincing.<br/><br/> Other than this, I have no complaints.

Christopher Lee looks cool and especially the army shot presumably of clones on the ramp, as well as the one where he is riding the speeder on Tatooine, that was cool as well, as for the bounty hunter shots, it was well worth 13.50. I suppose they added the bonus movie 'Harry Potter and the Cinematographer's Stone' to satisfy the non Star Wars fans, I didn't mind that too much really though.<br/><br/>
It seemed no sooner was that old guy Dimpledell and that chick lighting lamps than I was waking up to a train heading away from a huge guy (Beorn from 'The Hobbit' I think he was). I must have been conscious some of the time I suppose though because I remember something about an evil black warrior who turns people to the dark side and seems to have a bit of Phantom of the Opera/and that 'open your mind' guy from Total Recall, complex. I suppose it's a comfort to know that the underground wizard teachers are as ditsy and incompetent favouritists as every-day ones and that the students are as snobby, stuck up and in short cle she-ish as unskilled writers and Disney have always renderred them, and the best news is that Gandalf found a place to settle down and share his knowledge, also as a part-time Santa Clause. I also remember a part of it where one kid pulls out a cloak, holds it infront of himself discovering that it makes him invisible and another kid says, ""I know what that is! thats an invisible cloak!"" Harry must truly be a unique kid I would think, to walk through a wall to a magicians city, make a wand send books flying, find out he is bill gates' heir (or the equivalent), see a talking hat read his mind and then see a 20ft troll and still be wowing when tiny white butterflies appear out of nowhere.<br/><br/>
Rowling does not really have a very fertile imagination. Harry Potter is an uninspiring two step equasion. Nobody could really believe that kids would remember any of the 'love' messages or care about them, what they remember is how to cast spells, use a wand, respond to authority, respond to danger, and respond to warning. Harry Potter has no sense of narrative or entertainment, and certainly none of originality. There are points that you hope it will go somewhere but at the same time you can't see it happening, and your fears are rewarded. 10 year olds minus would like this, I am mystified as to where the trans generationalism is. Studios basically don't care about our opinions, because most blockbusters now days seem to justify thier budget in two weeks or less, after that we can pretend all we like that our opinions matter.<br/><br/>In all I would award an 8/10 I suppose, they have betrayed just enough to us but not too much about Episode II. See that trailer while Harry Potter remains in the cinemas, what I really like is that they perfectly picked thier movies, that trailer has been seen by 2 of the 3 biggest american audiences of 2001."

","Maggie Smith was wonderful, and Harry very well cast but the movie as a whole was long and slow and lacking in wit. As for all the controversy, most of the content was harmless enough, and some just whimsical, but there were some bits that were emotionally pretty strong (a little boy sacrificing himself for the greater good???) and violent and probably nightmare material. It was a pretty good story but could have been better told. For all the frenetic pace, it did seem to drag."

Acting was fair. Being true to Rowling's awesome book was pretty good also. But some people that have never read the book(s) might have a hard time following the movies choppy flow, which is okay at times, but at others it skips parts that should have stayed to help further explain the story, but other than that the movie is very well executed.

"karl laycock","6","0","1","21 December 2001"," Harry Potter lacks magic
","Having never read any of J.K. Rowling's work, I was quite curious to see if the reasons for her recent publishing phenomenon would be apparent from the film adaptation. Unfortunately the answer is a resounding 'no'.<br/><br/>The story combines two main themes, public school and wizardry, both of which are dealt with in somewhat traditional fashion. In fact the portrayal of Harry's schooling is very typically British and covers the usual ground - school traditions and rituals, house rivalries, etc. Rowling's approach to witchcraft is similarly conventional and will be familiar to viewers of all ages, i.e. wands, broomsticks, and bubbling potions.<br/><br/>If the appeal of the book has more to do with the style of writing than the plot and subject matter, then again there was little sign of this in the big screen version. The direction and editing are best described as solid and competent, rather than refreshing or inventive, happy to tread cautiously in preference to taking risks.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I was again left unmoved. In recent years we have been treated to some sparkling performances from young leads (Sixth Sense and Billy Elliott immediately spring to mind), but unfortunately the portrayal of Harry was uninspired and rather wooden at times. The rest of the cast where OK, yet I did not feel that anyone stood out in particular.<br/><br/>These criticisms aside, the film does contain many elements which will appeal to children. There is plenty of good old fashioned action sequences, childhood rivalries, the first awakenings of young love, and a healthy dose of humour. Although there are some moments of tension and suspense, the general feel of the move is quite light-hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>All in all its a well made, run of the mill, children's adventure yarn, which should provide decent entertainment for all the family. However a classic it isn't. It lacks the freshness and originality of Toy Story or Shrek, whilst falling well short of The Fellowship of the Ring in terms of visual impact. Since J.K. Rowling was in close contact with the production team I wonder how closely the end product matches her vision?"
"David Fick","7","0","1","30 December 2001"," (7) A truly enjoyable fantasy film
","Somehow, I had missed joining in on the phenomenon that was HARRY POTTER. I had not read any of the books and missed most of the hype preceding the film. In fact, I hadn't even seen the trailer. So it was with the healthy anticipation that I generally have for the movies I choose to see that I bought my ticket and entered the cinema where I would be transported into a world that returned me to the fantasies of my childhood. I have since read the books and come to understand some of the gripes of the many purists who have lamented some of the changes in the film. But despite some of these (fully justified) complaints, this film will see me return for several further viewings. <br/><br/>HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE captured my imagination from the first shots of Dumbledore as he douses the lights in Privet Drive until the camera pulls back in the final shots of the Hogwart Express taking the young wizards- and witches-in-training back for  their holiday after a busy term at Hogwarts. The film takes great care in creating the magical world to which Harry travels and the characters that inhabit that these fantastic places are beautifully brought to life by a set of actors who serve this film in no uncertain terms.<br/><br/>Of the child actors, Rupert Grint fares the best as the irrepressible Ron Weasly. His work in the film perfectly balances the delightfully waspish Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and the delicate work of Daniel Radcliffe as the title character. Some have criticised Radcliffe's work as a trifle bland: however, I feel this may have been a conscious choice on the part of the director Chris Columbus in the creation of a central everyman character with whom audiences can identify and onto whom they may graft their own personalities, dreams, wishes and fantasies. The other youthful characters' roles are greatly reduced from the book, most lamentably Neville Longbottom, whose arc in the book was truly touching, and Draco Malfoy, who does little more here than establish himself as a nemesis to the Potter/Granger/Weasly trio. The other regretted loss is Hermione's, robbing her of her climactic moment in the challenges that face the friends as they decode a series of charms in their quest for the sorcerer's stone. The adult cast is uniformly brilliant, with a Gandalfian Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, a suitably strict Minerva McGonagall in Maggie Smith and a perfectly slimy Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. Robbie Coltrane is outstanding as Rubeus Hagrid.<br/><br/>The film and my subsequent reading of the books have turned me into a HARRY POTTER fan. Like everyone else, I anticipate the fifth book impatiently and can't wait for the next film. I can't help wondering however how major the sacrifices in the subsequent films will be. Certainly, the third and fourth books should not be crammed into the  comparatively miniscule two and a half hours that was able to serve the first film extremely well. All I hope for with each subsequent film is a journey into the magical world that captured me so brilliantly in what is the finest fantasy film I have seen in many years."

","The wonderful thing about a book is that you can sit down and linger over all your favorite parts of it. When I was not too much younger, I'd re-read my favorite scenes of children's books I loved over and over, savouring them. Here, it's all rushed. Sure, it's Harry Potter's greatest hits in complelation format, but I felt stunned, rushed and at the same time bored during the film. I wasn't awed. I wasn't thrilled. Except for a few brief moments, I generally sat there keeping up to pace and wondering how they'd do the scary scenes. (Those, and the Quiddich match, were wonderful and real movie savers) It's a nice little film, and perhaps if I was 14 or so I'd want to see it again, which is of course the point. But not now."

"Tenant_Uen","6","0","1","24 December 2001"," Too faithful to be imaginative
","I have to own up that I am no fan of Harry Potter series. I read The Sorcerer's Stone partly because my girlfriend who completes all four HP's recommends them highly and partly out of curiosity. I finished it in two or three days and find it not so good as people said. We can see similar stock characters and typical stories in classics such as Charles Dickens' works and other novels intended for kids: a bereaved child in a hostile environment is recognized as the center of some important events and a respect figure. But this is for kids, and I have no objection for that. This Sunday I took my girlfriend to see the movie she had expected so long, only found it worse than the original book. Many viewers mention that the film omits too many quotes and episodes on the book, however this is not what I object to. When dealing with a literary work, a film director has to decide what to put in the flick and what to leave out; a movie can not include all characters or plots, or audience will be bored, and Warner Bros. will be broke. My opinion is just the opposite to these diehard fans: the director should cut off more irrelevant plots to make this film more tightly organized, like what he did when making Home Alone. Columbus is too concerned about satisfying book fans that he fails to edit the story into a more organic whole; the result is that he deletes the beginning as well as the resolution of many episodes to shorten runtime. But by doing this, he is being unfair to non-readers of HP. I think many moviegoers without prior knowledge of the story will be bewildered by some important scenes. Furthermore, the director doesn't make Harry Potter and other characters more vivid. If the actor doesn't have the extraordinary smile and innocent look, many viewers might lose interest on him. The earlier mirror episode provides an excellent chance to dig deeper inside Harry Potter's psychology and desire, which will make us identify and sympathize more with the boy, but the director doesn't hold on to the chance and let it slip away. We can see many great British actors in this film, all wasted in the flat narrative style. Columbus might cast them out of their appearance, and makeup might be the best thing in this blockbuster. You don't frown when characters show up--they look just the way they are supposed to look. This is an attempt to translate words into images, and that's the only thing Columbus does."
"thehindles","4","0","1","20 December 2001"," Not as pleased as the reviewers
","I was disappointed in the story and the acting.  There were too many weaknesses in the story as it was presented.  The extremely ill treatment of Harry by his aunt, her husband, and their son, for nothing more than her dislike of her sister because she was a wizard, seemed overly severe and not well founded, at least as presented.  Another small point of many, I'm not a fan of politically correctness, but, taking the Stone from the bank without informing them is theft no matter whether its the good guys or the bad guys and is a poor example in children's movie.  Then to hide it behind a three headed animal which will kill anything, adult or child, seemed a little heavy.  Unfortunately I was disappointed by much more, not the least of which was the much of the acting.  Most of the characters looked their part, but I have seen much better acting presentation, particularly, in the lead roles, in far lower rated movies.  While I found the story line old and cliched, it is amiable but presented too fast for what was necessary to fulfill the story or characters presentations. Sorry!  Only a 3. AJH"

","A classic example of why you don't just 'act out the book' when interpreting a novel for the screen. The film, while it looked and felt right in terms of visualisation and tone, was a lifeless quick once-over of the plot, leaving those who hadn't read the book (friends I went with) thinking it was rather a lame story. A real shame and a poor advertisement for the book. None of the British wit and charm of the story was preserved, substitued instead for weak Hollywood laughs (3 kids screaming in unison, then turning 2 seconds later and running out of the room -gimme a break).<br/><br/>I beg the movie-gods to not let this film franchise last more than a couple more films. There is NO way the team responible for this film could hope to pull off The Goblet of Fire (book 4). I fear the series would degenerate into a B-movie joke which would seriously undermine the integrity of this fantastic series of books.<br/><br/>(PS.

"Aidan McGuinness","6","0","1","17 December 2001"," Enjoyable, but hardly brilliant.
","I came to the film without having read the books. I had heard the movie followed slavishly to the novel but I reckoned if the movie was good enough, that shouldn't matter. So did the film feel like the adaption of a novel? Yes, very much so. It's obvious director Chris Columbus was scared of doing anything too radical with the material and so the movie tends to get bogged down at times. Certain elements in books do not translate well to movies unless done with a bit of flair - Columbus doesn't do this and so there is a certain weakness to the movie's structure. The acting isn't outstanding either among the kids. Daniel Radcliffe left as much of an impression on me as a battering with a soft feather would. It's not like he's from the dreadful Jake ""Phantom Menace"" Lloyd school of acting but he's entirely unremarkable all the same. Very forgettable performance. Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) are similarly perfunctionary and nothing more. The best performance is probably shared by Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) who really come across exactly what I would imagine from a kids book. The directing is perfectly competent and some of the action scenes are handled well - the quidditch match stands out most of all. Obviously Columbus was constrained by the material at hand and the target audience - I was hardly expecting to see Darren Aronofsky split-screen images of Hermione and Harry talking... The whole thing ends up like a well-done but by-the-numbers piece. No innovation here, no gambles. It was made to be as inoffensive as possible while trying to please as many. It's too long and could do with some pruning but in the end you're still left with an enjoyable movie. Just not a particularly brilliant one. 6.5/10"

","It is a crime for this movie to get an almost 8/10 rating and be among the top 250 on the IMDB database.<br/><br/>I would give this movie an 8/10 rating in regard to sticking with the book. It is one of the most faithful scripts that I have ever seen portrayed on the big screen.<br/><br/>As an unpublished author, I respect JK Rawlings's creation (and her drive to be published) and I have enjoyed the books immensely.  The fact that this movie sticks so close to the book is actually it's down fall.  There is almost no creative intervention by director Columbus and this movie is one of the few that could have used it.<br/><br/>The movie works better in the always fascinating ""fleshing"" of previously ""written"" characters.  That is to say that all of the characters in the book, that are brought to life by the movie, are interesting to see just for that fact.<br/><br/>Otherwise it surprised me that this movie was such a bore.  The CGI's were good - impressive even, but that failed to spark any real interest beyond, ""I wonder what this-or-that character will look like"".<br/><br/>I do not make a habit of reviewing any single plot feature on IMDB.  This is covered very well by other IMDB posters that have donated their time.  But I can say this, I was embarrassed by the pace of the plot.  I invited several fellow adults to the movie that knew nothing of Harry Potter - and I noticed, time after time, that all of them were checking their watches regularly.  I even found myself recalling the book and asking myself, ""Does anything exciting happen next?"".  The answer is sadly no.  Although the book was a joyful and fast read, the movie falls flat in delivering any of the suspense.  And, more importantly, it did not deliver on what made me enjoy the books so much - the feeling you get when you read (or watch) something that reminds you of the magic in your own childhood.  Not that there is any real magic in anyone's childhood, but friendships and adventures, that is the real magic (STAND BY ME / King's short story THE BODY).<br/><br/>As to the critics/parents demanding Rawling's head because of the Witches and Sorcerers in the book and movie - Hey folks, time to posse up some responsibility for your children.  An educated child, whose parents talk to and have discussions with them, would never believe that anything in this movie is more than a movie.  Or that a fiction book is anything more than a book.  Reading Potter or any book is 1000 times better than 20 minutes of MTV, Pokemon, Power Rangers or whatever other mass media outlet that parents allow to baby sit their children.  One reviewer cited CS Lewis's CHRONICLES OF NARNIA as a more wholesome form of reading.  And I would agree that the Narnia stories are superior, but more wholesome?  It is true that they usually parallel a biblical story or theme, but the relationship is usually so subtle that a child will not pick up on it.  And yes, there are witches and other magical beings in the stories (even Santa Clause).  Just because Lewis is a writer who writes on Christian themes, it does not make his stories less of a fantasy.  Read THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS by Lewis if you want your morals to be properly chastised.<br/><br/>If you are really looking for a good time to spend on some magic themes, try watching BELL, BOOK AND CANDLE, THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE 10TH KINGDOM (mini series).<br/><br/>4/10 - Too long, too boring, no magic."

This is definitely a movie for children. It is pretty nicely filmed, though I think you can reach much higher levels of oniric poetry without so many special effects (like Paul Grimault & Jacques Prévert's ""Le roi et l'oiseau""). But it does treat the audience like a bunch of kids no older than 11. Where is all the satiric tone I was told was abundant in the book? Is it really the best way to raise children, keeping them in a naive Disney-like ""gnan-gnan"" world?

"Spleen","Null","0","2","13 December 2001"," The kind of film you get when standards are exacting but not high
","What a lifeless film.  It's not exactly that Chris Columbus is too faithful to the book - although he fails to make changes that ought to have been made, like removing (or better still, drastically altering) that end-of-term dinner scene at the end, with its vulgar celebration of cheap success -; rather, he transfers material from page to screen with no clear idea of why he's doing so.  The entire film comes across as a cut-and-paste job.<br/><br/>I did wonder, at first, if the lack of screen tension was due to the fact that I'd read the book.  (Everyone else I know who read the book and then saw the film wondered the same thing.)  But I'm reasonably sure that reading the book has nothing to do with it.  Lifelessness, the ""cut-and-paste"" feeling, needless detail presented flatly rather than alluded to artfully - these are things intrinsic to the film; we'd notice them even if the books had never been written.  The only difference is that if the book hadn't been written it would be more of a mystery WHY the film was at once mildly entertaining and flat.  As it is, we know.  The director wanted to transfer (and ""transfer"" is the right word) as much as possible of the book to the screen because (a) he had no clear idea WHY he was transferring any of it, (b) the world's most powerful author and the world's largest media company were either breathing down his neck, or in a position to start breathing down his neck if they wanted to, and (c) the film would be harshly judged by a huge fan base consisting in large part of children - who are the worst possible judges of literary adaptions.<br/><br/>(I know this is beside the point, but what IS the deal with the Potter books?  I mean, I enjoy them, and I'll eagerly read the next, but surely it's obvious that they can't hold a candle to other fantasy works which children can or used to be able to appreciate: Lewis's Narnia books, Tolkein's ""The Hobbit"", Ende's ""The Neverending Story"" and ""Momo"" ... and others too, I'm sure.  Only by knowing little about fantasy is it possibly to feel strongly about Rowling either way.)<br/><br/>Mind you, I'm not letting Columbus off the hook.  He really is an execrable director.  ALL his films fall flat; it says a lot that ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is easily the best of them.  And he has the unique ability to draw weak, dramatically ineffective scores from composer John Williams (""Home Alone"", ""Home Alone 2"", ""Stepmom"").  This time, in this regard, he failed.  Williams has written one of his lesser scores, but it's still enchanting - well, to some degree -; it's one of the things that keep the film more or less chugging along.  Then there's the fact that, to be fair, Rowling's world DOES have its pleasing aspects; and also Alan Rickman's performance as Snape, and the LOOK in certain places - the colours captured under overcast English skies are rich and gorgeous.  The subtler computer effects (used to create, say, the animated photographs) demonstrate all that's good about modern effects technology.  The computer-GENERATED image, on the other hand (like the astroturf-green quidditch arena, or the cutesy three-headed dog, or the wall leading into Diagon Alley), demonstrate all that's bad.  They're as lousy as any similar effects anywhere else."

The technical merit is obvious but apart from that I see no room for serious criticism. Some extraordinary twists in the plot are made in order to make things... as Harry-friendly as possible and the whole thing seems more like a pop-icon celebration than like a... normal / average tale that I could have actually liked. It's as if we're supposed to go into the movie-theater already being in love with the damn kid! The fact that some things are... over-explained is perhaps suitable for the film's intended audience but tiring to an adult and I must also add that I could not help noticing a rather... sexist tone (female characters have a supporting role while the real heros are all male).

","I will start my complaints with this movie in a few very easy to follow statements. This movie has some of the best effects I have seen in a long time. I will admit that on my standpoint, but this leads to its downfall. The acting in this movie is very bad. They at least needed to find an actor who had some sort of talent for playing Harry Potter without basing it on an actor that looks like him. The characters are very undefined and undeveloped. Harry Potter doesn't once question what is happening to him and just lets it happen. He never changes and seems to show very little emotion. The main villain is very undefined and in the end, no one really knows what his deal is and does anyone really care. The movie is very long and very sugar-coated to say the least. The plot is very thin and really sucks much out of the imagination. the plot was something that you could only really enjoy if you read the book. I believe the director and producer was under the assumption that everyone read the book before viewing. This movie is only aimed at little kids and other people who watch this movie realize this too because there is very little they can get out of this movie beside its high budget and effects. In other words, this movie left me cold and unfulfilled."

In the book, Harry seemed to have earned the right to confront and defeat Voldemort, but in the movie, he just happens to end up in the right place at the right time, and with no particular effort, emerges victorious.<br/><br/>This movie is like a postcard version of the book, but with less emotion than you can put into a postcard.

Radcliffe is adequate as Potter. Rupert Grint is better as Ron. Emma Watson's hair isn't right. Robbie Coltrane is superb as Hagrid. Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith - blah, blah, blah. John Hurt's excellence as Mr. Ollivander is much appreciated.<br/><br/>I gave ""Harry Potter"" a 6 out of 10."
"ofirgraizer","6","0","1","10 December 2001"," 3 AMAZING scenes makes a worth watching.
","I'll say it plainly - this film was simply a visual imitation of the book. No more, no less.<br/><br/>The actors were all wonderful (except that Radcliffe kid who was HORRIBLE) - Rupert Grint as Ron was the best, Emma Watson as Hermione was charming, and of course all the masters of British theater - Maggie Smith the goddess, Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris (delightful!), John Hurt, the genius Fiona Shaw as Mss. Dursly and the greatest Alan Rickman... Except that kid who played Potter there is no complaining. Everyone has a part that's perfect for him\her.<br/><br/>The design was dazzling - I was amazed for seeing it on the screen was EXACTLY how I imagined it - the platform, the alley, the mines in the bank... The forest, and Hagrid's home... All was just beautiful, like being inside a dream. But there was something missing - the film didn't want to go beyond visualizing the book. It was boring, and slow, filled with many gaps in the script, and many annoying scenes, and if it wasn't to that hysteria all around in it, I'd dare say it's a bad film. It lacked the wittiness and dark humor that filled the books  the criticizing of English morals, and of the capitalist, merchandized culture of the modern world, a culture of which the Harry Potter phenomena long became a part.<br/><br/>But there are no words to describe the magic, for it was a truly a magical film, and that was mostly seen in 3 scenes that no matter how many flaws there are in this movie, these scenes were amazing. The Sorting Hat was very impressing, the face of Voldmort appearing on this guy's face was truly terrifying (and definitely not suitable for children!!!), and the unbelievable, paralyzing, divine scene of the Quiddich - the only reason I'll go watch it again. It was so realistic, and so eroding, and so beautiful, it kept me staring at the screen without being aware to what's really happening. It was the photography, and the music, and the editing, and of course the works of visual effects that gave me the same feeling that I had when I watched `Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'  a true katarzis, a true triumph of cinema over all other arts. It was the one scene in the film that made me think  hell, no book can describe something so stunningly. And I love books, and I found J. K. Rolling's description of the game in the book sweeping and wonderful, but the scene in the movie was, as only the 2 other scenes I mentioned earlier, truly superior to the writing.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film is a wonderful way to pass time, and a delightful way to marvel the capabilities of digital effects. As for more than that  I'd hope the first Lord Of The Rings film won't disappoint me. Not that I am much disappointed by ""Harry Potter"" because I didn't except much  it was directed by Chris Columbus who usually deals with children movies, so I'd knew it would be childish and not a bit sophisticated. That is what I expected it to be. I just hope that the next movie, as the second book, will have more to offer than this one had."
"Kw1373","3","0","1","8 December 2001"," Never in my memory have I seen a movie so boring.
","The first half hour or so my focus on Harry Potter was still there excusing all the obvious clues that this will be a flop to slow start.  But after more of the same thing the bells began to ring that I might have to put up with this for the remainder of the movie.<br/><br/>I had not read Harry Potter.  I'm a 28 year old male.  I enjoy fantasy science fiction and have read many such books.  I consider myself to have tremendous concentration and can appreciate a wide range of movies or documentaries even those that might put some people to sleep.<br/><br/>But I have never in my memory come across such a movie as this.  Given all the hypes and that the movie has some basis in a top selling book surely there must be something in it?<br/><br/>Usually top movies provide inspiration as well as good action, some dramatic scenes and engaging plot.  Who can forget the moment when Luke Skywalker stepped out into the dusk pondering at the sky with longing for his destiny with matching music just as powerful.  Or ET with the simple touch of love between a boy and an alien that lit up your heart.<br/><br/>Harry Potter can only be mentioned along side those movies to provide a contrast.  Harry Potter made me want to leave the cinema.  I was scratching, I was turning, I was very uncomfortable.  When my popcorn and drink ran out I was very irritated.  I thought maybe it was the seat which was too soft, the popcorn which made me feel too hot, trying to avoid the obvious.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is one-dimensional, very plain, fails to develop the characters, their relationships or the world of magic itself.  Everything happened in the movie as if the director expected everyone had already read the book and loved it so much that no real work needed to be done with the movie itself.  I was considering buying the book to see what all the fuss was about.  Having seen the movie, I am now very doubtful that I will risk wasting more time and money in case the book is anything like the movie.<br/><br/>To be fair, my young colleague who watched this movie with me largely enjoyed Harry Potter.  However, many had already read the book prior.  The special effects were also quite good.<br/><br/>This movie is not recommended for all but the young and naive."

At no time does anyone seem to be in real danger from it.  We have to wonder what the fuss is.<br/><br/>And -- cardinal sin here -- Harry does not seem to grow at all.  He is exactly the same little boy at the end as he was at the beginning.  This after a Hero's Quest?<br/><br/>And dumblesticks to Richard Harris -- who phoned in his role."

","This tale, based on the popular book series, is a real accomplishment from a technical standpoint but might seem somewhat tedious to non fans of the book. Tech achievements are all excellent and the cast, both young and old, aquit themselves very well. While the film does have some outstanding sequences that keep your attention, at 2 1/2 hours the film does run a good half hour too long and often bogs down in some less than captivating sequences that slow the story down. Fans have told me that these will pay off in the sequels, but as a vieweing experience on its own, the film is just a tad too long. GRADE: B"
"Doc_Who","5","0","1","8 December 2001"," Special effects take over and it has a very small plot!Wait for it on DVD/Videotape!
","Well today, I finally caved in and saw this movie. For starters I'm sick and tired about ""Harry Potter"". What I saw was just as I was expecting for a very big hyped movie. The movie itself had a very small plot(mainly Harry's first year at special school for wizards) and a small subplot about a special stone. This acting at times seems very wooden from both the actors, the extras etc. There is special effects overkill in this movie.<br/><br/>
The running time is a little over 2 1/2 hours. This movies moves very slowly a lot of the time. Even when they have special effects it seems like it's a too long of a movie. I liked the adult actors, but I hope the child actors playing Harry Potter etc do not get typecast as they could if they play their roles until they are grown up. I also wondered if parts of this movie were left out on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>I say if you are die hard fan of the series, see this movie, But if you are causal fan or just sick and tired of the whole ""Harry Potter"" thing wait for it on DVD/videotape."
"supertom-3","6","0","1","6 December 2001"," Very entertaining!
","I used to, in fact I still do, love fantasy films for example Labyrinth, Masters of the universe, Princess bride and of course the first three star wars films. Fantasy films have the most imaginative of set designs and costumes and when done well take you to another world for 90 or so minutes. Since the 80's these films have dried up, very rarely are they released and even rarer now are they good. The last I can remember was Phantom Menace but that wasn't great, plus there is an overuse of effects to, I like to see an actor walking on a set for real. All of a sudden Harry Potter comes out which will be quickly followed by Lord of the rings. I went not knowing what to expect, I had heard 99% excellent reviews, but would this sort of film still appeal to me? answer yes. This film gets the balance between kids fun and subtley included adult jokes perfectly, it has moments of universal joy and the set designs are brilliant as are the effects, the effects thankfully are not overused either. Most films of this type would have an adult in the lead for the purpose really of experienced acting skills despite a child being more accessible for the younger audience, but thankfully the three principle child actors are good in their roles, the supporting cast of the younger generation range from average to quite wooden but they will get better with age. As a critic said the three main kids are not portrayed as to cutsie like the case might have been, aside from their magical skills they are seemingly you average run of the mill kids you see every day in the highstreet or whatever. Basically this film has a universal appeal and I would say is the first decent non cartoon fantasy of the 90's. Its solid entertainment. ***"
"shaqkobelakers87","4","0","1","5 December 2001"," What is the deal with this movie?
","I have no idea what all the commotion and talk over this movie is. I started to read the book put I stopped because it was just boring and I was unable to handle it. The movie was even worse because I felt it lacked the book's details but who cares because the kid actors sucked anyway. I bet that if a book was never writte for this movie this would not be as popular as it is. Another reason why I did not like this movie is because fantasy movies are bad. The only one I really enjoyed was ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Going back to HP. If you like fantasy movies and the book, then you will like the movie. However, if you hate fantasy movies and the book, then do not see this. In my opinion, 4 out of 10."
"kikishell","3","0","1","5 December 2001"," Could have been a great movie but...
","The story of Harry Potter could have been brought to life through the magic of cinema. Unfortunately, that was not executed. The pacing of the film is extremely slow, which makes me wonder how a 6-year old child would be able to sit still for two and a half hours straight when I couldn't do it. Another thing I questioned is that the movie title includes the Sorcerer's Stone...yet, the stone isn't even mentioned until the middle of the movie. When Harry becomes a seeker and plays in his first game, we are excited and interested by the quick and useful cuts. Yet as the game is over...we are left unfulfilled, once again. About ten minutes later, six people walked out of the theater. This continued throughout the movie. By the end of the film, there were approximately 15 people left, out of 25 or 30. On a positive note, the special effects used in the film were very good as well as some of the visual aspects. If there is a sequel to this film, I hope that it will include some excitement, lose the turtle-paced conversations and cuts and include something to keep the audience enticed."

","Okay, I have never read a Harry Potter book in my life, and never intended to. So when I saw HARRY POTTER at the cinemas I wasnt expecting anything in particular and I was totally N-O-T blown away. It was like watching a TV series with a huge budget and just 5 episodes run one after the other.<br/><br/>The story was totally luckluster and does not deserve so much praise in my mind. I mean, it was okay. The SFX was okay. The direction was alright. The cinematography nothing super special. And the kid actors just plain sucked. What is with that over-annunciation (spell?) when they speak? And their reactions were pretty bad. I mean....Kirsten Dunst - a real actress - seemed to be able to do a far better performance than these 3 when she played Claudia in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE.<br/><br/>Anyway....I think if your a fan...I can only assume you'll wet your pants with pleasure of seeing your lovely books on the screen.

","I have never read any of the books and so I am a little tired of people comparing the two. As a film in it's own right I can't see what the fuss is all about. The story is charming yet predictable. The special effects leave something to be desired whereas the production design is excellent. Actors of the calibre of Rickman, Smith and Harris are wasted with small and unimportant scenes, and the rest of the film is dominated by children with mediocre acting ability. It was modestly entertaining but at 2 and 1/2 hours long it drags on with a wafer thin plot and marginally entertaining set pieces. I can see the appeal of the film to those who have read the book, but as a stand alone piece of film making it comes about par for the course."
"naamaral","3","0","1","3 December 2001"," Great fx, no substance
","** LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD **<br/><br/>First of all, let me say that I read all four Harry Potter books. I'm usually a reader of much more 'serious' stuff but that definitely didn't prevent me from enjoying every little sentence in them. They are among the best stuff I've ever read, despite some awkward spots here and there.<br/><br/>I was extremely disappointed with the movie though. It zooms past most scenes in the books but no time was given to develop them. Even despite the fantastic Quidditch game and the final scenes, everything happened so quickly I'm surprised anyone thinks this movie has been given such high praise among the public. What happened to Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback for instance?<br/><br/>The most positive thing about this movie is that it pictured the scenes exactly like our imagination would see it while reading the book. In that, only people who enjoyed the book would *potentially* enjoy the movie. The other good thing is that some of the characters, though not the most important were really good (I loved Dudley Dursley, Snape and his evil voice and Neville Longbottom). On the other hand, the actors who played Harry Potter and Hermione's roles were hideous, even for little kid actors they were - absolutely no talent there.<br/><br/>Although I didn't mis-spend my money I found the movie to be shallow, under-developed and a totally missed opportunity to make fans really proud of 'their hero'.<br/><br/>I will be giving it a 3, and that's all because of the special effects. I certainly won't want to see this movie again so soon."
"Dreamer-40","6","0","1","2 December 2001"," Not bad, but nothing special (Spoilers)
","Note: Although I plan to, I haven't read the books yet, so this is only based on the movie... (Some spoilers below!)<br/><br/>While I did generally enjoy the movie, I was somewhat disappointed in a number of aspects:<br/><br/>1) Too many plot twists from left field with no explanation or foreshadowing. I really feel as though the movie betrays the audience by hooking them along and then going in an entirely different direction. From what I've heard from others, the books were much better at ambiguity and keeping the twists in while keeping them plausible. 2) Bits of continuity-related problems; some big, some small. A small example - is anyone else bothered by the number of times Harry casually discards the (incredibly rare) Cloak of Invisibility on the floor, yet in a later scene has miraculously recovered it? (More annoying is the times that he's dropped it when it would seem fairly useful in the next scene, but would clearly spoil the plot. It's just too convenient a literary/cinematic device that - like the physical cloak itself - seems to get used or neglected at whim.) 3) Some characters are barely tokens or archetypes with no fleshing out whatsoever. However, given the length of the book and what they're trying to accomplish, that's somewhat understandable. 4) It almost seems like some of the morals/lessons of the story are questionable... Maybe it's just me, but it seems Quidditch teaches showboating and that the team really doesn't matter; it's all largely in one person's hands. Likewise, there's no evidence why Slythernn was so far ahead in points, but it seemed somewhat unfair and arbitrary to simply promote Gryffindor. Heck - they were trailing at the bottom; it seems like it also unfairly punishes the two other houses (which were largely ignored)... Anyway, not a bad movie, but nothing incredibly gripping in my opinion. The effects weren't anything special. The acting was generally good and the story did move along, but as I mentioned above had some weak points in construction and execution..."
"uds3","Null","0","1","1 December 2001"," The best looking ""B"" grade film in history!
","Now pay attention students (You thought I was going to say ""007"" then, didn't you?), lets get this straight...HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE (PHILOSOPHER'S STONE in just about every country but the US) is NOT a great movie. The most expensive to date maybe, certainly hyped and marketed into the stratosphere, but despite many redeeming features which I will get to later, it remains curiously ordinary!<br/><br/>The over-riding problem with the film can be summed up in two words. Daniel Radcliffe! Critics, devotees, Potter obsessionalists can say what they like...""but, but he's SUPPOSED to be just an ordinary boy...""Yeah? well where does it say he has to display not one shred of charisma? Rowling's Potter is a bit of a lad...heaps of charisma on tap, Radcliffe looks OK, but the instant he opens his mouth in the opening scenes, the film is doomed! The lad just doesn't have it!!!! This is WIMP with a capital W! His two co-stars, Rupert Grint as Ron ""Know wot I mean?"" Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermione ""just watch out for me when I grow up"" Granger leave him for dead. Watson especially acts the other two off the screen. She ""has it!""  Bitchy little thing and cute as all hell, she should have her own spin-off series! But, back to Radcliffe! He spends the majority of the movie looking totally bemused and looking for the chalk-marks to stand on! Victorious, more by luck than judgment in the Quidditch match, he seems as surprised as anyone at the outcome! To be fair, it is his first 'spin at the wheel' and perhaps he may improve, although I suspect it will be more a case of having to having to block him out and concentrate on other things, to get much out of the sequels.<br/><br/>Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid the giant gatekeeper, carries the movie! He is wonderfully convincing and imparts both the gruff kindness and moral strength the role demands. At times, especially early in the piece, you can see him clearly trying to WILL Radcliffe to act, hoping to lead by example. He supports his willing but clearly over-awed co-star to the very best of his ability. You can see him giving Radcliffe a hug after the first take saying ""Not bad Daniel, not bad....now, lets try it THIS way!!!"" The flick is in ""worthwhile"" mode, whenever Coltrane is on-screen, which fortunately is quite often!<br/><br/>Richard Harris excels as Hogwarts Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. He can play this type of role in his sleep now. At all times however one could be forgiven for thinking that here again is Marcus Aurelius, deeply self-contemplative and dignified. Look closely at the scene where he is explaining to Harry to forego the delights of the magic mirror and to be aware of the need to rely on self-determination rather than the false promises of dreams. Is he not back in his tent with Russell Crowe here, saying much the same thing? Unfortunately, Harris/Dumbledore have little enough screen time, cut down significantly from the original book.<br/><br/>The same might be said of Alan Rickman, who's performance as professor Severus Snape is the thespian highlight of the movie. As teacher of Spells and Potions, he just oozes menace and hidden ambition. His contribution to HARRY POTTER is unfortunately somewhat restricted, much like John Cleese's thirty odd seconds screen-time which are a complete waste of his presence.<br/><br/>Maggie Smith, who has propped up British movies for decades, is perfect as Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall. She imparts just the right blend of loftiness and kindly understanding that J K Rowling had in mind when she wrote the book.<br/><br/>Amongst the other star roles, Ian Hart is fine as Professor Quirrell and John Hurt, looking way over 100 (what's happened to him????) is Ollivander, who gives Harry his first wand (Another scene where Radcliffe simply looks too stunned for words!)<br/><br/>Besides the casting of Radcliffe, the principal fault with the movie is its lack of continuity. Columbus has obviously tried to remain faithful to the book, knowing that millions of readers worldwide would have screamed the place down had he veered much from the original. In doing so however we now are presented with a series of ""sequences"" from the book, but which are not linked with any particular purpose or intent. It is obvious that the production team have decided, ""Right, well lets start with Harry's home in Privet Lane!"" It looks like it WAS the first scene shot too, Radciffe appears to be a stunned mullet at this juncture! After that Columbus has decided ""OK, now we'll shoot the Quidditch match!""  then the 'Platform 9 and three quarters' bit (sheesh, forget Julie Walters wouldja!). The Hogwarts Express comes over well (must have cost a truck load of $'s in makeover!) The all up result though is simply loosely related scenes as they have ticked off their filmed wish-list! In doing this however, a principal Rowling plot development centering on Lord Voldermort has been butchered and then puttied-in with the Unicorn sequence.<br/><br/>The FX however, are the real stars of the movie. The London parallel/universe streets, the goblins, the wonderfully gothic Hogwarts School of Magic, its grounds, Quidditch field and corridors. The changing steps with a touch of the DARK CITY's! and of course, the owls, three-headed dog and other magical creatures, most especially Hagrid's cutest of cute, baby dragon! (It almost redeemed the entire film just on its own) All THIS the younger viewers will see, caring not one bit about continuity, acting accomplishments etc. From THEIR viewpoint, the film delivers all the magic of the book, it is the adult viewer will see through it.<br/><br/>Maybe WE weren't ever supposed to be there?"

But the biggest let-down must have been the storyline, which clearly evolved into a Lord-of-the Rings wannabe after the sparkling initial ingenuity of a modern-day wizard boarding school, and ended with an 'Indian Jones and the Last Crusade' -like finale.<br/><br/> I gave it a 5 rating.

"aedil","6","0","1","29 November 2001"," Less than expected
","I was both anxious and reluctant to see the Harry Potter movie, because it is always tricky to make a movie live up to the level of the book.  With the J. K. Rowling involved with the movie making, I expected it to be a fairly consistent movie, with the book story only edited to make it fit within the timespan of a movie, and keep people's attention (easier to do in writing than in visual aspects).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, parts were apparently edited out without much attention to consistency.  To start at the end...  Why was Snape's test (right before Dumbledore's) removed, while it was the main basis for the points given for Hermione in the end?  What was the point in having Neville try to stop Harry, Ron and Hermione from leaving the Gryffindor common room, when the movie did not contain the reasons why alot of people (including Neville) felt that Harry, Ron and Hermione shouldn't be risking losing more points for Gryffindor?<br/><br/>It all adds up to a rather weak storyline, and frankly I would have been at a loss seeing this movie without reading the book.  It just doesn't add up. Without the book knowledge to fill in the blanks, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone seems hardly more than a movie with alot of publicity around it, and a poorly developed storyline *in the movie itself*.<br/><br/>Of course, the book and the storyline therein is marvelous!"
"Ajkiwi","6","0","1","29 November 2001"," Pretty, plotfilled, but soulless...
","Everyone's already said it: This is almost exactly the Harry Potter world from the book.  Almost perfectly rendered, characters spot on, even if Harry was a little wooden, and has most of the action from the book.<br/><br/>Which is, of course, the problem.<br/><br/>I saw this movie with a bunch of kids in the rows in front of and behind me. The younger ones fell asleep.  No surprise there.  The older ones watched it, marvelled at it, compared it to their imagined versions, and... almost fell asleep.<br/><br/>There is a lot to cram in to this movie.  But curiously, rather than rating some plot points as more important, others as less, this version of Harry contains EVERYTHING.  All the major plot points are there, with a couple of stripped down exceptions.  Faithful to the story - yes.  Faithful to the spirit of the books - no.  And the kids around me said it.<br/><br/>""Where were all the jokes, Dad?"" Asked one kid. ""Where was Lee Jordan's commentary of the quidditch,"" asked another. ""It didn't FEEL like fun,"" a third said as we walked out, probably the most telling comment of all.<br/><br/>Rather than prioritising the plot points, we got the lot.  So the spirit of the books - the urgency, the glee, the fun, the joy - all disappeared.  We lost Harry's character... reduced to a quiet noone. - which is odd, coz all of the other characters were perfect! (Though Dumbledore needs a sense of humour, and the Wesley twins aren't ""bad"" enough""...)<br/><br/>A functional rendering of the book, but as one person said as we walked out: ""Value for money wise - I'd rather spend $18.95 on the book than $10 on that movie""."
"LadyViola5","Null","0","1","12 November 2001"," Bad news, guys: it sucks.
","I will give the movie credit: they stuck extremely close to the book. Unfortunately, that's about as good as it gets. Daniel Radcliff as Harry has unseated Jake Lloyd in Episode 1 as Worst Performance by a Child Actor in a Major Motion Picture. Ron and Hermione aren't much better. I don't know who coached the kids, but they all seemed to take a page from the William Shatner textbook for acting. None of the three can get through a sentence without having a long, surprised, dramatic pause, accompanied by stuttering and repeating themselves. For example:<br/><br/>""You mean....I'm a.... I'm a wizard?""<br/><br/>""You mean....Does he....does he want you dead?""<br/><br/>""You mean....You mean you know about that?""<br/><br/>I'm not even exaggerating. They deliver every line like that for the entire two and a half hours. The entire cast essentially look the part, but the acting is flat and uninspired (with the exception, sometimes, of Alan Rickman). The cast is also badly directed. The timing is terrible, the shots are bland and stark. It looked like they put a four year old with a camcorder in charge of this film. The books were fresh and magical. The movie is cold and boring. Alan Rickman has his usual moments of brilliance, but his performance is marred by the fact that director Chris Columbus has him raising his eyebrows and looking sinister most of the time, and those shots don't come off well. You know you have problems when not even Alan Rickman can save your movie.<br/><br/>The score is distracting and way over the top, especially in the beginning.<br/><br/>
The special effects are up and down. The sets and backgrounds look really cool, and the creatures sometimes look cool, but sometimes they're dreadful. The centaur in the Forbidden Forest looked as bad as the Rock at the end of The Mummy Returns.  Voldemort's face was also pretty badly done.  Hagrid sometimes looked cool, but something about his legs and the way he walked reminded me of Snuffelufagus from Sesame Street.<br/><br/>The worst was probably the chess scene toward the end. I guess Chris Columbus figured kids would be bored by watching a chess game, so instead (and I'm not kidding), he has about a minute of stone chess pieces exploding one after the other in slow motion, with an occasional shot of Ron, Harry, and Hermione attempting to act scared and determined at the same time. It doesn't help that the music at this point consists of very loud war drums. I thought for a minute or so that the projectionist had switched reels and we were actually watching Bravehart.<br/><br/>Harry's voice is different in every scene. I've read in the papers over here that Radcliff's voice cracked midway through filming, and some of his lines were dubbed by another kid. So you have Radcliff with a high voice, Radcliff with a lower voice, and Radcliff with a voice that's not Radcliff's.<br/><br/>
The entire movie felt very rushed--understandably, since they tried to cram everything from the book into the movie, and the whole Harry Potter world is way too complex to do that easily. The movie was also, conversely, entirely too long.  I'm currently dreading what's going to happen to the rest of the books if they try to make them, as they get progressively longer and more involved--especially the fourth one.<br/><br/>The kids will love it.  Adults who know better and are also fans of the book will be disappointed.<br/><br/>After this disaster, I'm terrified of what's going to happen to Lord of the Rings."

","With the movie finally here out in the open it's hard to say if expectations weren't too high. It all sounded good: a fine cast & J.K. Rowling being mainly involved. Could this go wrong?<br/><br/>Well, yes and no. First of all: the cast is fine, the adultcast is great even (with Hagrid being my favorite and a fabulous John Hurt as mr. Ollivander). The kids are fine too, Emma Watson does a great job als Hermione. The locations look great, Hogwarth's is fabulous - with the floating pumpkins at Halloween as a subtle highlight. And of course, after reading the books, it's fun to see it all for a change. Then there are scenes that are truly fascinating, like quidditch, the dark forest and the chess-play. John Williams's music is very good. So, there *is* a lot to enjoy. And the computer-generated moving stairs are beautiful. But even in this movie the most scary element (invisible Voldemort in a black cloak drinking unicornblood and threatening Harry) is just a piece of black cloth. As where the CGI-troll wasn't scary at all.<br/><br/>The major lack in the movie is it's pace. It's too fast. There is simply too much to tell and the movie can't choose between plot (what is the philosopher's stone and who wants to steal it) and simply showing Harry's life on Hogwarth's (school, quidditch, magic). It's clear that a 2.5 hour movie cannot do this both properly. Sometimes it feels like we're zapping through Harry's life, and the fact that the events in the movie take about a year doesn't come through at all.<br/><br/>I believe this all comes from the involvement of J.K. Rowling and the filmmaker's idea to stick as close to the book as possible. The movie is indeed close to the book, too close I think. Someone like Spielberg - who didn't get the job - would have made the story more into a movie and less into a combination of scenes.<br/><br/>With this movie, you keep feeling like you are on the sideline, looking in on Harry's life, where you should be drawn in to his world, like in the books. Now it's just a bunch of nice pictures, changing quickly and leaving me unsatisfied and longing for the warm long lasting bath the books are."

","Given that they set out to make a film of the book, this is about as good as it could be. The cast are well-chosen, the scenery and effects eminently appropriate.<br/><br/>However, the unfortunate effect is merely to demonstrate that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone works much better as a book. Like all good adventures, Harry Potter has a whole lot of plot. There simply isn't time to fit the plot into the film comfortably without sacrificing other things. The relationships between the characters are thinly drawn, and the atmosphere of the school doesn't really come through.<br/><br/>There's nothing overtly wrong with the film, and Harry Potter fans shouldn't be too disappointed, but, as so often, it's a much better book than it is a film."

","This movie was lacking something. If I think hard enough, I bet I'll remember... Oh, yes, it's lacking exactly what its book counterpart had. Imagination. The book was really good; however, the movie... well, you can see that I gave it a 4. The movie's climax was awful. It was almost as if J. K. Rowling was trying to make this movie into a big mystery rather than an adventure. It was some mystery in the book--but not as much as in the movie. The climax in the book was built solidly on evidence and perfectly fitting pieces. However, the movie had cut-off puzzle pieces that were thrown together in the end and somehow expected to be understood. I would also expect better from John Williams (the guy who composed music for Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, etc.). I hate to say it, but this music was awful. There was only one spot in which the music fit into the movie and sounded good, and it was toward the end of the movie. John Williams tried too hard to make it sound ""magical"", I think. The movie follows as closely as it can to the book, but I wouldn't really suggest seeing this in the theater unless you're a true die hard Harry Potter fan."

He was in the paradoxical position of being a total moron of a student, and nonetheless a teacher's pet. Apparently, this was because he had some powerful parents. Add to this a total lack of any charisma, and you have a formula for a kid who would ordinarily never keep his lunch money past 10 AM. But, magically, Potter becomes some sort of a hero. Nice fantasy! I never realized how much I need justice to prevail in fairy tales. Apparently I do, because here I am, angry that Harry Potter didn't become the #1 wedgie recipient of his class."

"jules14384","3","0","1","25 November 2001"," Over used computer graphics, loudness and poor acting... where shall I begin.
","I don't expect my comments on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to be published as it goes against the complete general consensus that this film is one of the best.  However I believe strongly in my opinion and felt that the other side of the arguement should be addressed.<br/><br/>I found the first installment a complete disappointment both from the masses amount of hype it received and the genuine entertainment that the book offered.  I expected a film that would make me feel like a child again particularly after J.K Rowling herself approved and backed it.  However in reality I found the film the complete opposite.<br/><br/>No one can deny the obvious attraction that children would have to both the books and the film particularly young boys who may enjoy the fighting, sports and ""violence"".  I cannot see the appeal to everyone else particularly adults and particularly those who have read the books.<br/><br/>Generally I thought the film was badly made with the computer graphics being far to overused as if the creators are screaming ""look what we can do with technology"", the story is unrealistic but still believable, the film destroyed this believability.  I also found most of the actors poor particularly Alan Rickman whose performances in the past should have made him a perfect Professor Snape but in actual fact he over-acted the role which could have been brilliant if he had just been himself or found the ability he used as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves.  I thought the children were very stiff as well particularly Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson as Harry and Hermione, these children could not act scared under any circumstances, when they should have been screaming ""ahhhhhhh"" they wimply said ""oooh"".  The film also put too much emphasis on noise in order to attract the children however there is only so much crashing, booming and banging that one film can take.<br/><br/>There were some small pros of the film such as Robbie Coltrane's portrayal of Hagrid and the comic timing of Ron Weasley as well as the well done Quidditch and Chess scenes.  However this doesn't make up for the lack of some of my personal favourite aspects of the book, the darkness of the film which had very little happiness and light and the first half an hour which was so rushed but so empty without explanation or the time taken to build up the atmosphere, particularly the heartlessness of the Dursley family.<br/><br/>In conclusion Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a complete success at the box office and I am sure it will be when released on video and when promoting it's array of merchandise.  Whether or not this is deserved success for the film is another matter, to me the creators have been successful in creating an illusion of greatness that people have been gullible to take without really analysing the film itself."
"TheBFJ","4","0","1","24 November 2001"," entertaining but ultimately nothing special
","First off I haven't read any of the books. There's no real reason for this I simply haven't got round to them. which in the current climate must make me somewhat of a minority.<br/><br/>secondly one word to sum up this film: uneven<br/><br/>There are some thoroughly entertaining moments in this film particularly Robbie Coltraine's scenes as his comic timing is brilliant as ever. these moments are counter balanced by dire action sequences, particularly the quiditch game which is so slick and clinical that all traces of emotion are lost (think pod race in episode 1)<br/><br/>the three lead children where all excellent right up to the last twenty minutes when all of a sudden they reverted back to standard child actors and became stiff and wooden. In fact this entire section was badly scripted and directed which somewhat ruined what had gone before. until this point most of the dialogue between them was excellent.<br/><br/>In places however the film seemed little more than a montage of special effects which come so thick and fast that the subtlety of the ""magic"" scenery is lost.<br/><br/>I could be way off the mark here but from what I've heard about the books they are actually quite dark and Harry is quite insecure about his place in the school. I was expecting to see at least a little of this emotional turbulence but it appeared to have been glossed over with standard Hollywood values of friendship and loyalty. I thought the reason Harry had become so popular was that we finally had a child character who dealt with real problems. unfortunately the film doesn't deal with this at all.<br/><br/>All that criticism out the way the film is actually quite enjoyable over all and the running time didn't bother me at all so it must have kept me interested. It's just a shame thy couldn't have done more than present the same old 2 dimensional Hollywood characters."

","I've never read the Harry Potter series, but many adults have told me they are worth a look. In fact, it's pretty remarkable how many post-teens are into this book series. It sort of left me wondering what was it about second childhoods, and how much clever people make by cashing in on them.<br/><br/>Watching this movie gives you a sense as to the deeper value of the Harry Potter series, though just a sense. The universe of Harry Potter, at least what's presented on-screen, is packed with colorful personalities, fantastic backdrops, and some very clever magical objects. At its center is a character that brings together the best of Luke Skywalker and Frank Merriwell, while recalling and reclaiming a slightly antique British identity in line with Victorian explorers and ""Chariots of Fire."" I think I get it now.<br/><br/>But this movie tries to do too much with the source material. Judicious editing would have been a good idea. As it is, the movie spends more than 2 1/2 hours giving lip service, and often not much more, to bits of business that seem pretty extraneous by the time the credits roll. Even the central plot elements seem tacked on and inadequately dealt with. What was Alan Rickman's character's place in the story? Did we really need to spend so much time with Harry's unpleasant uncle and aunt, given the fact they are gone and forgotten 20 minutes in? Doesn't any kid at Hogwarts feel the least bit jealous at all the attention the doting faculty spends on precious Harry?<br/><br/>The story also moves a wee bit too easily. No real challenges face our hero. Everything that happens to Harry happens with such minimum fuss and so much applause from the surrounding characters that it gets a bit tired, even if the actor playing Harry is good at remaining sympathetic and projecting wonder. By the end, when the solution to a crisis at hand is literally dug out of Harry's pocket, I sort of shrugged and thought to myself: Of course. It's Harry Potter.<br/><br/>I can't believe all these bookreaders, not to mention those kids running around with their brooms and glasses on Halloween, fell for such denatured yarn-spinning. There's something good at the core of the movie, and it's likely the vision of the author as presented in the novels, but it doesn't come across well here. The producer seems more interested in giving every beloved book nugget its own turn on screen than in telling an interesting story. You may go in in search of your inner child, but you'll end up just feeling 160 minutes older than when you went in."

Indeed one parent commented to me that it took her child more time to watch the film then to read the book. The sparse and simple dialogue of the books translates well into a script but the real strength of this movie is special effects to rival a Spielberg film and three excellent child actors. I could not however recommend to an adult to run out and spend their 12 dollars on this unless they are bringing a child. This is a detuned Indiana Jones for 10 year olds rather than a film like Shrek that works on two levels. Not really suitable for younger children."

The film, on the other hand, whilst a reasonably faithful and engaging adaptation, adds little beyond putting amiable faces to the names of the characters.

"skilesbot","5","0","1","23 November 2001"," too faithful to the book
","Chris Columbus really bungled this one.  Why he failed to see the myriad moments of the book that fall flat on screen escapes me.<br/><br/>For example, the opening scene:  what's exciting about a couple wizards telling each other about this Harry Potter kid?  Show--don't tell--please.  Then much of the following scenes were the same thing--actors sounding off lines without really listening to them.<br/><br/>Did anyone edit this movie?<br/><br/>After the show, I heard several audience members murmur how they enjoyed it.  But during the show, there were few moments when anyone laughed, or reacted in any way at all.  I suspect people are so convinced by the marketing plan that the movie MUST be good--and after this year, desperate for creativity outside of Hollywood--that they have no choice but to react with quiet consent.  An epic movie like this one should do more than illicit a few, 'oh yeah, it was good, sure....'<br/><br/>The film should have been half as long.  Why keep so many scenes from the book that were boring exposition?  J.K. Rowling's only tools were words on the page.  Columbus has image and sound--why does he always revert to dialogue to explain everything?  I realized that the film is largely intended for kids, but kids aren't stupid.<br/><br/>There was never a sense of an over-arching conflict that bound the pieces together.  The scenes were occasionally exciting, but only in a self-contained context.  John Cleese was wasted as Nearly Headless Nick.  The lighting was less than magical.  Harry Potter acts like a tiny Keanu Reeves, his only reactions to anything being ""whoa,"" and ""wow.""  The introduction of Hogwarts fizzles as soon as we get inside and the professors start explaining things.  The podrace sequence--excuse me, Quidditch match--has been done, done, done.  What's the deal with Quidditch, anyhow?  Why bother scoring points when the whole match comes down to whoever catches the Snitch?  A lot of the magic in Harry Potter's world is either ripped from older stories or too half-baked to make any sense.<br/><br/>I would, however, like to commend Alan Rickman, Tom Felton, and David Bradley, for their nuanced performances of Snape, Malfoy, and Filch, respectively.  Fine job.<br/><br/>My advice for the sequel:  take liberties with the book!"

","It certainly wasn't an easy task Chris Columbus took upon himself when he started working on adapting one of the most loved novels ever for the screen. I have to say that I was among those who felt almost upset when I heard that Columbus would direct the movie -- Home Alone, need I say more? I was doubtful if Columbus would be capable to go to darker places. I am happy to say that Columbus has stayed true to the source material in most ways. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a rather dark movie considering that it is a children's film. Luckily, there are some comic scenes as well -- though not nearly as many as in the book.<br/><br/>The acting from the adult actors is brilliant -- as was only expected with such a cast! Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith and my personal ""favourite"" Ian Hart (who doesn't have enough screen time, if you ask me) are all great. The child actors is another matter... Daniel Radcliffe has to look surprised, awed and scared all the time. It's kind of boring. I'm sure he will do better in the next movie when -- hopefully -- his eyebrows won't be at the edge of his scalp all the time. The best of the younger actors is without a doubt Rupert Grint who plays Ron. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) is also good.<br/><br/>There are certain aspects of the film that are absolutely brilliant. Cinematography, production design, costume design et cetera. Hogwarts, for example, looked almost exactly as I had imagined it.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is a good movie. It's not great, but even if I am somewhat disappointed I still feel that there couldn't have been a better adaptation of the novel (well, perhaps Terry Gilliam could have done something brilliant with the source material). However, images can never replace Rowling's language and style. Believe me, the best H.P.-movie you will ever see is the one you see in your mind when you read the novel.<br/><br/>Still, it is a job well done by Columbus and screenwriter Steven Kloves and everyone else who worked on the film.

It's interesting going to Rotten Tomatoes.com and reading the critical consensus, especially the ones who say, ""Well, it's all right, but it's no 'Wizard of Oz'.""  Since ""The Wizard of Oz"" got exactly the same mix of Good, Bad and Eh reviews and went on to become a classic, I think we know what the critics can do with their ""Eh""s.<br/><br/>2. The three kids are great, with my favoritism leaning toward Rupert Grint (Ron); he had the best comic timing.  A bit of Harry's personality shading was missing.  He looked noble a lot.<br/><br/>3. Being an elderly (43) fan of the books (Rowling is a fabulous writer and a hot redhead), I had an acid test ready for the film: would it make me teary-eyed in the same place the book did?  (It has to do with Neville at the very end, so I won't say what it is here.)  The movie passed.<br/><br/>4. Only regrets: not enough build-up for Malfoy as Harry's nemesis; it would have been nice to see more of the adults, especially John Cleese; and they REALLY need to stop showing the trailer for ""E.T."" with Drew Barrymore before the film, since it just lends to speculation that in ten years the currently adorable Emma Watson (Hermione) will be tattooed and flashing David Letterman.<br/><br/>Anyway, they did a really great job with this film.

","My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the Harry Potter books.  We were both disappointed by the movie.  One of the primary reasons for our disappointment has been all the hype about how closely the movie follows the book. While the movie follows the book better than some, there are numerous places where the book plot was cast aside by some editor with no appreciation for what makes the books so magical in the first place. Important plot points were either cut out, or revised for the best visual effect.<br/><br/>We also thought some of the casting choices, and some of the performances, were quite poor.  While Hagrid was excellently portrayed, as was Ron, the portrayal of Harry was mediocre. We both thought the actress who played Hermione was trying WAY too hard.  As for Dumbledore: Richard Harris may be talented, but he was not well cast in this role.  We also thought the way the plot developed significantly underplayed Snape's role, and failed to take advantage of the talented Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>Jesterpee's individual comments: In addition to the plot shortcomings, I thought this movie was another example of action and visual impact over substance.  While much of the movie contained very detailed scenery and some beautiful cinematic shots, I felt that certain scenes were unnecessarily prolonged only for the sake of showing off the detailed set and pretty scenery. I also felt that many of the high-speed scenes (e.g., the Quidditch match) relied heavily on obvious computer graphics that were not very convincing.<br/><br/>My wife's individual comments:  In addition to our comments above, my wife felt that the plot would be very hard to follow, unless you have already read the books."

For instance, a lot of the characters didn't have as much screen time as they are mentioned in the book. (It seems that Snape, Quirrell, George, Fred and Percy Weasly had bigger roles; and Hedwig, I can't even remember the name being mentioned) But really, that doesn't matter. What matters is that the movie is good or not, and it is.<br/><br/>There aren't a lot of family movies that capture the kind of humor and adventure/drama that this one does. Just for record, I've read all the books, so that might make me a bit biased, but really its a good adaption.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. I honestly think there should be Academy Award nominations for this movie, both in acting and the movie itself.<br/><br/>-Richard Harris, Maggie Smith,Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are PERFECT!!, they are so good at capturing the essence of their characters, that shouldn't go without a nomination.<br/><br/>-Also, Daniel Radcliffe does a very, very good job as Harry. I liked him in this part because you can tell he wasn't overly acting like some child stars do; instead his shy/quiet nature was exactly like Harry Potter -Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were also PERFECT as their roles of Hermione and Ron, respectively.

","As with the books, the movies seem to get better as they progress, so of the two ""Harry Potter"" movies currently released (the third is shortly forthcoming), this is the weakest.<br/><br/>It suffers mainly from some dodgy acting from child actors, at times weak special effects, and a screenplay trying to cram too much of the book's contents into the movie.<br/><br/>However it's still an above-average attempt with some wonderful set-pieces, magical moments and a fantastic older cast.<br/><br/>In fact one of the best things about the movie is its cast including the late great Richard Harris, the wonderful Maggie Smith, a very Hagrid-like Robbie Coltrane, and a great turn from a genuinely smarmy Alan Rickman who is a superb Snape. Also good support from Fiona Shaw as a smirking Aunt Petunia, John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander, John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, Ian Hart as Quirrell, and Julie Walters as a delightful Mrs. Weasley."

","What could have been the fantasy film of the decade has turned out to be another Hollywood fastbuck disappointment.  With so many truly talented fantasy directors out there - Tim Burton, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, heck, even Steven Spielberg - how is it Chris Columbus wound up at the helm? With two and a half hours to play, how did we end up with a movie with absolutely no character development?  There is no soul, no wit, just a dry Cliff's Notes version of the book.  Columbus and Kloves may have read the book, but they sure didn't get it.<br/><br/>The only thing that stands out about the film is some brilliant casting. Alan Rickman portrays the semi-evil Snape on levels not explored in the books.  Pity they gave him nothing to do.  The other extremely talented cast members are also wasted, as the director has reduced most of the non-child characters to cameo roles.  Maggie Smith would be the quintessential Professor McGonagall if they gave her more than thirty seconds of screen time per scene.<br/><br/>I want my nine bucks back."

","I am not a religious person but I have to wonder why any Christian, Jew or Muslim would allow their child to see this movie. Perhaps they do not know that witchcraft is a real religion and there are many practicing witches and wizards (a male witch) in this world. I have personally met real witches and there are many documentary films about them.  They are nothing like movie witches but they do practice their religion. This movie is a candy-coated promotional film for the witchcraft religion. Take your children and see if they don't come out wanting to be a witch or wizard. Don't you think it is odd that no other religion is even mention in the film?<br/><br/>Also, a parent should ask themselves just what values their child will take away from the story. The children in this film regularly disobey the adults and are rewarded for it.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the above, I found the movie a disappointment. The story was so dull that I had to fight falling asleep. By the time the end mercifully arrived, I had lost interest in the story and did not quite understand the point, if there is one, or did I even care. The special effects are not up to today's standard. The snake and the troll were especially bad and unconvincing. Many other things just did not look real.<br/><br/>In summary, the creepy promotion of the witchcraft religion and the fact that it is not very good makes this a movie to skip."
"midnightrane","6","0","1","21 November 2001"," Magic carpet unravels
","This movie, based on the book of the same name, starts a wee bit too sluggish, features some nice special effects in the later half and gets downright cheesy and predictable at the end. It relays the story of a young lad who discovers he has untold abilities in the art of wizardry and builds thereon with the process of his schooling in said talent. The character development is way too slow in portions and non-existent in others--unless you've read the book, you don't have much chance of knowing who they're talking about, considering they have such weird names. It has moments of neatness (""sorting hat"", ""moving stairwells"", etc.), but you never feel immersed in the ""Hogwarts"" world. I got the vibe they should have either totally hammed it up or made it quite a bit more gritty. Alas, it appears yet another novel couldn't be properly consolidated into a film format. Still, the kiddies will probably love it and it could have been much worse, although it is a bit too long--I kept checking my watch."

","As a fan of the Harry Potter books, I went to the movie with great anticipation and expectation.  Many of of those expectations were met. The look of the Hogwarts school, the special effects, and the casting of characters are all superb.  The children were delightfully genuine, witty and not overly cute.<br/><br/>With such a great look and cast, it is a shame that the movie itself is so extremely boring and poorly paced.  The beginning has no grab and the rest of the movie methodically displays scenes straight from the book.  Then all of a sudden at the climax of the movie, the movie trades in its slow pace for one that rushes to a completely unsatisfying end.  The books have a dark eerie tone to them, and are magical whodunnits with clues dispersed along the way.  This movie captured none of this mystery and instead is tame and uninteresting.  The two and a half hours (not including the 30 minutes of previews and commercials) soon became agonizing as the appreciation to the special effects wears off.<br/><br/>One can only hope that the next installment of this series will improve as director Columbus has all the elements here for a great movie (a great cast, wonderful plotlines, and a huge budget) if he just had the courage to use them properly."

Could they possibly have found a group of supporting child actors quite so bad?

And it'll probably be the most successful film of all time. How depressing."
"rtypos","6","0","1","19 November 2001"," No magic in the movie
","As an adult fan of the Harry Potter series, I was unimpressed by the cinematic version of the story and surprised that so many critics are already calling this uninspired production a classic. I can think of dozens of childrens' movies that are superior to this one including Shrek and Monsters Inc. which are playing at the same time. Compared to a true classic like ET, this Harry Potter movie appears weak even by muggle standards.<br/><br/>With only a few exceptions the acting here was wooden and uninspired. Maggie Smith as Professor/Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall stood out as did David Bradley as Caretaker Argus Filch. Robbie Coltrane as Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid also had his moments. The kids were cute, but they all acted as if they were reading their lines and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)had pretty well one expression for every occasion. The special effects were pedestrian.<br/><br/>
As others have also noted, director Chris Columbus would have been better off to leave out some parts of the book and concentrate on doing a better job with the parts he kept. As it is, the movie rushes forward, lurching from one scene to another and barely taking the time to develop characters or any kind of dramatic tension.<br/><br/>What made the first book so enjoyable for me was the excitement of discovering a magic world existing side-by-side with the muggles. It was so much fun to experience Harry's surprise and wonderment when he is first introduced to that world. This movie captures none of that. For a movie about wizards and witches there is painfully little magic to be found here."

","I missed a lot of the fuss about the books because I was in China so I dutifully worked my way through them - and found myself getting rather involved - they're nothing special but they're a good read.<br/><br/>In this light I'm shocked, but not surprised at the fuss being made about the film, which was so slavishly close to the novel that I wondered why they didn't just film Richard Harris reading it to us.<br/><br/>There is a lot of potential here; great characters and locations and a lot of imagination to be tapped. Sadly Chris Colombus is not the right man to be making these films. Past experience tells us that his idea displaying emotion is to get Macauly Culkin or Robin Williams to gurn at the screen. I felt nothing for the characters other than what I remembered in the books. Still, the casting is wonderful and its great to see that many British actors in a big budget film. The direction and editing reduces the film to a series of stop start scenes that barely builds up the the muted climax.<br/><br/>Better than most films of its kind (I remember when the studios desperately hoped to break box office records, rather than arrogantly annoucing it). Its just a pity we're going to have to sit through the lukewarm books 2 and 3 before the best of the bunch arrives."

The special effects were, for the most part, exciting, though it was blatantly obvious when screens were used and some of the creatures didn't seem ""real"" (i.e. the troll).<br/><br/>The let-down, however, came because there were no surprises, and more importantly, little wit.  Everyone who read the books will know exactly what happens, so that is to be expected, but it makes me wonder if going to later ""Potter"" movies will be worth it.  The people I went to the movie with and I each preferred the images we made up in reading the books to the one presented on screen.

"lot49","7","0","1","20 November 2001"," Good but not great: Chris Columbus isn't pushing the envelope
","Readers seem pleased that the movie seldom strays from the book. Steven Kloves' screenplay seems to be a transcription of J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter novel. Unfortunately, this means that some adult viewers might be glancing at their watches as the movie slowly resolves the plot. I noticed that the film's length posed no problem for older children in the theater when I saw it. (The kids seemed to know the story, so there probably weren't many surprises for them.)  I must commend the screenwriter for doing his best with Rowling's major plot twist -- which I had found a bit awkward when I read the novel. <br/><br/>I believe the story is character-driven rather than plot-driven, so the mystery is less important to me than the characters' arcs. I also believe that the story's wizardry is a MacGuffin. It's more important for us to see Harry, Ron and Hermione discover the value of friendship and loyalty than learn spells and potions.<br/><br/>In his earlier movies, Chris Columbus demonstrates a knack for working with children, so I'm not surprised that Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give excellent performances. (BTW, I am NEVER forgiving toward bad child actors.) Harry, Ron and Hermione must be likable and believable, and they are. Without the convincing work by this trio, the great performances by the stellar British cast would not have been enough to carry the movie.<br/><br/>
If the rest of films in this series are of this caliber, they should be popular for years to come."

Not to be unneccessarily criticial but this movie will recieve many popular reviews that are just caught up in the wave after Sept. 11 to reaffirm people's confidence in just how nice it is to live today. Even Ebert has reduced himself to giving this film four stars. Lets see.<br/><br/>Harry in the movie is weak and without personality. It almost seems that they casted Harry Potter to be a child who's only talent it to gaze with a smile of wonderment at the fantastic visual effects around him. You'll see it over, and over, and over again. Harry takes the switch from cinderella living under the staircase to wizard celebrity without a hitch of change or realization. Just that ""WOW"" look on his face. Suddenly however he's compleatly not affected by an obviously harmfull enviroment.<br/><br/>He does show a little feeling by selecting the rejected wizard family as his friends, however not too much time for this because its on to the FX baby. Moving stairs, trolls and whatever else they can come up with. What happens is there is a defenite trend of not acting, but a director pushing kids through the motions of making a movie in between the glamourous and flashy things we saw in the trailer.

","So there I was looking for another movie to take me to another world, to send shivers down my spine and thrill me to the edge of my seat - with high hopes that young Harry had the ability. Maybe at the ripe old age of thirty I've lost that sense of Wonder that Poppins and Wonka and Chitty gave me as a child but hell, a kid on a broomstick seems so passe these days. Flying nannies and cars and chocolate factory managers were amazing back then! Oh and there was no one as scary as the Childcatcher either.<br/><br/>So close to the book that the film dismisses the staple 3 act blockbuster format for episodic content that leads to small climaxes and a poorly placed highlight - yes the Quidditch game is great... There's no real sense of urgency to each scene, so when the final battle comes it leaves a feeling of...well, not much at all really...<br/><br/>There are some great set pieces (besides the Quidditch) and nice performances - notably the best child actor is Malfoy, snidey and annoying as he should be while Radcliffe as Harry is nothing more than O.K. The rest of the kids are cast well - though the Yorkshire nerd (who lives down the road from me apparently) left me cold. The adults are pulled from some great British actors holes and do a great job oh the whole, most playing roles that were written for them - Coltraine as Hagrid and Bates as Snape.<br/><br/>Look, I enjoyed it - kids'll love it, but it's an empty sort of feeling the movie leaves you with and with such good source material that's, well, annoying. Hell, the movie seemed to insult the book by holding up the obvious reference points that Rowling went to when creating Harry and Hogwarts. There's so much Star Wars - 'come to the dark side Harry' - and more than enough Lord Of The Rings theft going on here.<br/><br/>So as I left the cinema - I thought to myself, why was the most entertaining thing about the film the trailers that were shown before it?

The move missed a lot of the little details that were so important in the book (For example, the letters coming addressed to the different locations where Harry Potter was moved to in the house, and the dragon bit also was very weak).  Overall, the story seemed to rush through the development to ""get to the chase"".  I felt indifferent to the Harry Potter character, and annoyed with him sometimes, remember the Home Alone star? Furthermore, the music seemed very awkward and sporadically placed.   It's too bad that movie creators are lazing about and opting for special effects and no imagination!

I found they really messed up the ending, and some of the characters in the book aren't even there! It doesn't really give you the feeling that they're in Hogwarts, there's hardly any classes, a real lack of school atmosphere. They get lost in all the wrong times and places and some of the scenes really don't make sense.  I know originally it was 4 hours long and they had to cut it down a lot, but I would have watched it for 7 hours if it would have made a better movie.<br/><br/>It wasn't all bad though.

The biggest disappointment for me was the quidditch game during which the slytherin team came across as comic-book characters rather than sinister and cynical as they seemed to me in the book. However it remains engrossing despite knowing the story in much detail beforehand. The child actors turn in respectable performances and much of the adult cast is superb, particularly - for me - Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. The sets are superb although there is slightly too much dependence on cg effects in some parts.

It just feels like it's trying to show certain passages from the book but not really tell a decent story along the way.  The motives and plot progression were horribly forced.  Some examples were the whole part where the kids guessed about the dragon being a distraction for Hagrid and the immediate realization by the kids that they had to physically participate in the big chess game.  Why were 2 pieces missing?  Why did Ron end up riding on another piece?  It just makes no sense.  Why did the stone suddenly end up in Harry's pocket?  I know the Headmaster explained it but it's still totally unsatisfactory.  And what's with the Headmaster altogether?  What kind of ridiculous name is Dumbledore?  Am I supposed to take him at all seriously as a powerful wizard with a name like that?  His character totally bit.  He never displayed any real powers, he never gave any great counsel, and he wasn't that cool as a screen presence.  So what about Harry, is his only power basically that he can ride a broomstick at a championship level? Why did he just sit there for most of the Quiddich game?  What is the point of even having the other players is once a seeker catches that winged ball the game is won?  Why did I find myself fully bored by about the time they went into the woods?  Why was Harry's entire character as boring as soccer? I've just read glowing review after glowing review about this movie and I can only surmise that these are all people who've read the book and are filling in all the little annoying gaps from memory.<br/><br/>Don't bother rushing out to see this in the theater (unless you can't stand being left out of the endless conversations there are sure to be about it). It's a real good rental I'm sure.  It's certainly good for kids, except it'll probably corrupt them over to the occult.  The whole thing just didn't hang together.  It felt basically like Home Alone.<br/><br/>BTW - the production design was for the most part pretty great.  Oh, and Hermione was just awesome, I loved her.

The major thing that I noticed was the complete lack of buzz during the film.  No laughs, no sudden breaths, very little sound at all.  I think the movie simply moved too fast, and everyone felt the need to focus on the screen completely so as not to miss anything.  I understand the problems in adapting a widely read and hugely successful novel to a screenplay, so I empathize with the screenwriter. I enjoyed the film, even at the 2.5 hour length, and I recommend that fans of the books see it, but I do not think children under 7-8 would sit through the second half. One negative (somewhat) was the seeming lack of special effects in a movie about a wizard.  What effects were there were fairly shoddy.

Harry is supposedly the one who develops the theory of somebody's trying to steel the sorcerer's stone and trys to stop it. This kind of stunts must requires lots of inspiration, insights or leadership. But I could not see any of these in this kid. He looks like just an ordinary normal everyday kid. Whenever he needed to provide a penetration or a leadership it looked just strange. It just did not match to his characteristics.<br/><br/>Actually the other kids are doing good. Especially Tom Felton. He looks so natural as if he himself was a cheeky aggresive challenging kid but still hard to completely hate.

You don't get emotionally wrapped in what happens, and you just don't care what happens to these people. If you've already read the books, then Harry et al. already mean something to you, so it's okay-- but if you haven't, you're in for a yawn. The movie was also lacking a lot of the books' wit... presumably because they couldn't fit anything else in.<br/><br/>I think anyone who's a HP fan will enjoy the movie, but people who haven't read the books won't. The movie doesn't make you care about the characters: it depends on you to already care. It caters directly to the fans that will graft their OWN understanding of Harry et al. onto the screen exposition, who aren't depending on the movie to show them what these characters are like, because they already know. To anyone who's seen the movie and hasn't read the books, I'd say: Go read them even if you didn't like the movie; what the film most painfully lacks, the books actually do supply."

","***************WARNING, WARNING, WARNING!!!!!!***************** !!!!Contains spoilers!!!! Now before I start, I want to tell you that I'm a crazy Harry Potter fan, I've read all 4 books multiple times and was waiting anxiously for this movie to come out for months. I was sadly dissapointed. I know a lot of people loved the movie, even critics... but I found it lacked so much from the books. I know you're all saying:<br/><br/>""Well, it's impossible to put every single detail into the movie, and besides, it's already 2 1/2 hours long!"" But I have to tell you, I wouldn't have mind if it was 5 hours long if it would just have had more of the books in it. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>It starts out fine... dumbledore's coming down the street with his put-outer... and so on and so forth (I'm not going to tell you everything!) but then it gets all messed up. No Mrs. Figgs, no Piers, an abrupt leaving of privet drive, and you know what the worst thing of all is?? Hagrid says the ""Harry your a wizard"" part all wrong! I won't tell you how though..... Anyway, moving on....<br/><br/>Once they get to Hogwarts, it starts getting better... but things happen in the castle that aren't supposed to. They get lost in all the wrong times and places, time seems to leap in great bunches, almost no classes and... oops giving to much away....<br/><br/>Well... it soon gets obvious that Quirell's the bad guy, even to people who haven't read the books and I, like many other people have a big problem at the end involving something that Hermione does, or well is ""supposed"" to do... won't say what though...<br/><br/>Don't worry, I liked many things in the movie too. The Quidditch match was amazing and the invisibility cloak looked really real... speaking of real, Fluffy was incredible! I liked the slober... Oooh and other effects were cool too but lacked an amount of magic that the book brings.<br/><br/>
Well anyway, over all, I'd say if you're a huge Harry Potter fan, and you know every aspect of his life, you may not enjoy the movie as much as those who won't know what to expect. I'd give it 5/10 or **1/2 on *****, whichever way you want to rate it.<br/><br/>Thanx for your time! Bye"

","Second rate special effects and not enough humor to help you get through a 2 1/2 hour movie.  I am assuming you have to have some knowledge of the books to understand, I did not so much of it was boring.  What would have helped would have been some American actors to provide comic relief (Robin Williams)."

","maybe it's just because i'm a cynical 16-year old know-it-all, but i didn't really see the big deal about good old Harry Potter. it was an alright movie, with some minor cool happenings, but it WAS kind of long and draggy at times..well i'll shut up now, it wasn't THAT bad..<br/><br/>Liz"

","Well, I rode down early on the Saturday after it opened to get tickets. Shouldn't have bothered going early.  Tickets were not a problem.<br/><br/>The movie was fine but slow.  If I had been by myself about 30 minutes into it I would probably have walked out.  Staying awake was a problem.  Now I am a fan of the books but the movie at 2 1/2 hours was way to long.  Stretching it out this long created periods of absolutely nothing happening.<br/><br/>
Good movie for the kids but it really could stand to be tightened up with some good editing."
"Deadly Dave","3","0","1","17 November 2001"," Harry Potter and the Pile of You Know What
","To put not too fine a point on it, this movie manages to destroy everything good about what was an adequate piece of children's literature.  The CGI is frequently ropey, all the money evidently having been spent on the Quidditch match.  The performances of the adult actors are going-through-the-motions as a rule, while among the young actors, only Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Sean Biggerstaff as Wood stand out as new talents.  Daniel Radcliffe is given virtually nothing to do as Harry other than grin or look puzzled as the occasion demands it, and Emma Watson's performance as Hermione Granger is so gut-twistingly awful as to spoil any entertainment that might otherwise have been obtained from the film.  Chris Columbus' direction is stodgy - you would have thought after Bicentennial Man that they would never have let him near a book adaptation again - and even the normally excellent John Williams manages to provide a score which is mainly unfitting and intrusive.<br/><br/>In short; if you are not a fan of the books, the film will not convert you. If you are a fan of the books, you would be well advised to stay away and thus preserve your enjoyment of them."
"Cristofer Seven","5","0","1","17 November 2001"," I found it to be a bore...
","I am a father of two boys ages 5 & 6.  We were all excited about seeing this movie.  The reviews are incredible.  I have yet to find a media outlet that did not just LOVE this move.  We were ready to be transported into the world of Harry Potter.  This movie must be like two and a half hours long.  The boys were squirming and asking to leave.  For me there just was no big payoff.  The CGI's looked like CGI's.  The movie moved at a very slow pace. I was waiting for that moment when I would be drawn in. It never happened. The acting seemed to be fine.  It is a nice picture to look at.  The brooms were cool, but There in no reason to see this movie in a theater.  There has been a drought of good movies, but this film is no oasis, it is more like finding an 8 oz. bottle of tap."

","Harry Potter is a long, dry crawl through a thirsty desert.  in the distance, dimly, you think you see a giant glass of water in the shape of Alan Rickman - only, when you get there, its not.<br/><br/>Where was the mystery and darkness everyone had told me would be there? From minute one I knew that he would overcome *every challenge* with panache and energy to spare.  From minute one I knew that the evil wasn't any more sinister than my high-school economics professor:  Valdemort is a tame and pale shadow of the evils of Darth Vader or Sauron;  even Dennis the Menace's foil of Mr. Wilson had more depth of character and motivation.<br/><br/>At the movie's half-way point, I found myself eagerly awaiting the end of the film - not because it was keeping me on the edge of the seat, but because I wanted to go home.  Obviously, this story was meant to be a book as it certainly doesn't flow well as a film (I could see several place where there was supposed to be the word ""Chapter Five"" or somesuch).<br/><br/>Of course, boring the audience could be a favorite trick added by the director, who also made the horrible attempt at a tear-jerker that was ""Bicentennial Man"", a yawn factory that is *also* a long, dry crawl through a thirsty desert, only you don't even get to *see* a glass of water.<br/><br/>Cinematically, so many of the scenes and filming styles were stolen directly from ""Star Wars"" (such as the chess game in the dining hall [""I suggest a *new* strategy, Artoo - let the wookie win""] to the Luke vs. Speederbike filming of Harry and enemy Slytherin Quidditch players).  The editing was choppy and amateurish, and in this day of Jar Jar Binks, the 1997 quality of the special effects is criminal.<br/><br/>Stay in and play ""Tony Hawk"" instead."
"vivalarsx","5","0","1","18 November 2001"," Rather Earthbound
","Harry Potter was actually not bad; considering the director, I assumed it would be horrid as his other films.  It was a trace stodgy at the beginning, with much-too-much time spent with the awful relatives (this could have been a brief, effective montage during the credits--we know he's miserable, we don't need twenty minutes of beating over the head to ""get it"").  And we could have dispensed with the entire train ride; just because a scene is in a book, does not mean that it MUST be in the movie--movies and books are not the same medium, and a film needs to travel at some sort of a clip. But once Potter got to school, I rather enjoyed myself.  With the exception of the ghastly Emma Watson as Hermione (an awful, awful little actress who mistakes enunciation for acting), the performers are enjoyable and funny. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are always a delight, and they really set a pace in their scenes that the rest of the movie lacks.  Some of the effects are grand, some are rather lumpen, but the movie is by and large trying so hard to charm us that you have to give in or feel like a curmudgeon.  I gave in.  I had a diverting afternoon.  Oddly enough, I took my children (8 & 10) and enjoyed it MUCH MORE than they did.  I won't say this isn't a children's movie; it's just too long and there isn't that feeling of awe that the best children's films can evoke in a child.  They both thought it couldn't hold a candle to ""Shrek""--a movie with more of an and-then-what-happened vibe. Harry Potter needs to soar; this movie doesn't, but is enjoyable nevertheless."
"Exploited","6","0","1","18 November 2001"," The unfinished movie.
","I really liked reading the Harry Potter-stories, but this movie has so many shortcomings that I have given it a 3/10.<br/><br/>After watching it, I got the impression that this movie was a rush-job altogether. Some scenes OBVIOUSLY needed more takes and I can't imagine John Williams will like what they've done with his music. The music and the scenes look as if they are from two completely different movies.<br/><br/>I'm too shocked still to know where to begin expressing what is wrong with this movie. *sigh*<br/><br/>I can imagine that you have to leave things from a book in its conversion to the silver screen. Time constraints amongst other things are important factors. But in this adaptation they've really torn the book to shreds. For instance, the book contains a lot of 'funny bits' to give the reader some 'light relief'. Done away with in the movie. Also, there seems to be no place in the movie for some 'rest' for the viewer. No space for 'suspense to build'. BAM! BAM! BAM! and important bits of imformation sacrificed for the fast score.<br/><br/>All in all, my opinion of this movie is really low. A rushed through job with really horrible timing, bad editting and (probably the worst result of all this) really horrible acting in places."
"bigdgun","4","0","1","18 November 2001"," Bad editing spoils a fun time.
","What is a great story; well-cast; and with rich cinematographic license (a long word to say special effects), is spoiled by the worst editing job of the year. Scenes that go nowhere and mean nothing are interspersed within the movie. And they leave one wondering what the hell the director was doing. The library-research scene with the warm lamp and the bad guys rushing off to locate the intruder is completely left hanging. The scene beneath the trapdoor where the heroes have to win at chess to enter, only to find the bad guy already there without any such challenge. And the fifteen minute Quillage scene which is merely a set-up to a stupid gag (literally) joke. These mistakes, and others, left me bored and bewildered. However if you have a ten year old, or younger, they will probably be more taken with the tricks than with the failings."

","I am a fan of the books but at first i didn't think the movie would be very good but after i watched the movie I thought it was good. The quidditch match was pretty cool. Hagrid's ""I shouldn't have told you that"" was funny. Even if you don't read the books, you should watch the movie."
"rkhwaja","2","0","2","17 November 2001"," Sorry, but it's awful :(
","I'm a huge fan of the books, and I was hoping to like the movie.  But from the first with Dumbledore turning out the lights it was sooo dismal and depressing.  Where was the humour and warmth?  The acting was stilted. There were non-sequiturs galore, if I was watching this without having read the book, I would have been foxed good and proper.<br/><br/>I had a problem with most of the interpretation too - there was no ""public school"" atmosphere to the place.  The wizards and witches spoke in an awed way about their world, rather than with the matter-of-factness that is so funny in the book.  Dumbledore was too serious, Snape barely said anything, Potter was unexpressive, the bloody baron was rather too happy etc.  I liked Snape, when he was around, Herminone, Ron, and McGonagall.<br/><br/>The length was a problem too.  Who'd have thought a Harry Potter movie would be so boring that you couldn't stand it for 2 1/2 hours though?<br/><br/>Maybe a problem was that they were trying to keep it too close to the book and the studio took the shears to it when it turned out to be too long?<br/><br/>Anyhoot, sorry, but it was bloody awful :("
"Aurora-38","6","0","1","16 November 2001"," A big disappointment
","I was so disappointed with this movie. The first part of the movie before Harry gets to Hogwarts was just terrible! If I hadn't read the book, it would not have made any sense. Crucial scenes were cut out so that there was no transition, and the acting was weak. The changes between really dark scenes and really bright scenes were not well done either. The Dursleys were not as I had imagined them to be, especially Mr. Dursley. The casting of the Weasleys (except for Ron) was just downright wrong. The twins fun, happy-go-luckyness, and humour were not captured - the lines that were supposed to be funny were delivered without conviction, and the twins became dull barely existent characters. <br/><br/>I really liked Harry, Hermione, and especially Ron. McGonagall was good too, but Dumbledore was not characterized very well - he didn't show his friendly wise side well. <br/><br/>The second half of the movie improved, but it wasn't enough. The movie lacked good focus and pacing. The adaptation from book to movie failed. The movie attempted to follow the book almost exactly while keeping the length down so that the result was a choppy movie. For example, in one scene it has Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Hagrid watching the dragon hatch. The next scene was Hagrid, unconvincingly, saying that the dragon was taken away - no explanation, and if it wasn't for the fact that Hagrid getting the dragon egg was important to the plot, it would have been a scene with absolutely no importance. I wasn't looking for every scene to be included in the movie but important scenes that explained the story should not have been left out."
