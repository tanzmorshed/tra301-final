","I attended the Cast and Crew screening on Sunday, in Leicester Square, with high hopes for this film as it's without doubt the most exciting job I've had. This was my first feature experience, and working for Tim Burton was a hell of a way to start.<br/><br/>But, even as someone with a lot of time for his films, and a pre-existing bias, I couldn't really connect with this. The cast acquit themselves well, especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick, but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free-floating, evocative trip. Sure, it's weird looking, but we've seen it before, and back then in films like Edward Scissorhands it had a sense of purpose. Now we're left exploring a CGI wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder. The book revels in its bizarre environs, absurd dialogue and whimsical characters. This film grounds them, drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread. It seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time, simply because we're not giving much to care for.<br/><br/>With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop-motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his ""Tideland"" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. What we end up with is a mid-point that fails to get to grips with what enchants people about the Alice story, and another chance to see a beautiful waif walk around twisted, quasi-Gothic landscapes to a score by Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>Not that this isn't an enjoyable experience in itself, and as seen in the vast Screen 1 at the Empire it is at times breathtakingly pretty. It's just inessential, and while it may be unfair to expect a classic from a favoured filmmaker every time out, when they tackle something with the pedigree and history of Alice In Wonderland you can't help but hope for something special. And that's the problem, that Tim Burton, while he is still making decent films, has been a long way off special for some time now.<br/><br/>6/10 (if they gave half stars it'd be 6.5), but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's possible that my grade is affected by high expectations and lost potential. If you have kids, I'm sure it'll be better than 90% of the dross that passes for family films now. At least there is some artistry involved, and while he might not be at his best I'll still always pay to see a Tim Burton film (although I got this one for free...)"

","It is still worth the high price of the 3-D admission to see some of the amazing animation and design, but the writing is extremely boring and clumsy, and the performances cannot save it. Too many liberties were taken with the originals here, and in no way improve upon them, it only barely resembles either of Carroll's books in theme and some specific scenes. There are some ""Disney moments"" that literally set off a gag reflex as well.<br/><br/>The animation is quite stunning and wonderful though, as is the costuming and set design (in so much as there were sets and not just green screens, I'm sure SOME actual props were used). There are some clever elements that owe only to good visual design and direction I'm sure, as the only other clever bits in the dialogue were the parts directly lifted from the originals."

"WithoutPorpoise","2","44","61","2 April 2010"," Alice against Lewis Carroll
","I loved ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and remember it as an amazing and timeless adventure indeed. Alice wanders around in a world so enigmatic and unstable that you never know what will happen next, and what twist will put Alice in just new trouble, often unintentionally and tragically made worse by her own doing. Now this is all exactly what this movie does not have. After Alice arrives in the new 'underland', you will soon be in on the entire story: It is two sides, good against evil, and Alice is to slay a monster. Not a single second is unexpected. Nor are there any twists. (But even the first minutes are astonishingly wanting any concept: Scenes without any real characters rush by, there is no focus of attention in the opening.) But most of all, my understanding of then brand ""Alice"" is that she originally wanders around a dream land that confronts her with her own self, her anxieties, her shadowy anticipation that things will not be all nice and easy, all taking shape in landscapes, characters and events painted in dream-language. Of this essence, it should be no problem to create a movie that really leaves an impression - let alone, if Tim Burton is in the team. But there is nothing, nothing of this concept in this movie. Instead of joining a charismatic and mature character on the journey through her own dismal, natural instabilities that every one carries inside, the story here is already written, and Alice is only to follow marked footprints. For the only reason that... she is the one foretold to do it. There is merely the most silly 'hollywood-intellectualism', where 'good against evil' must be taken as, like, certainly some sort of metaphor representing all our everyday struggles, and it is so much about decision making and all... I'm devastated. Eventually, Tim Burton has added his potential for design to a movie completely without content. The only metaphor I see is Lewis Carroll appearing at the end in the figure of the Jabberwokie, and Alice, slaying him. Carroll is dead, long live 'Alice does Hollywood'."
"Red-Barracuda","3","193","297","22 March 2010"," Treading water in Wonderland
","Sometimes I think that I should like Tim Burton movies more than I do. Don't get me wrong, the man has made some excellent films, such as the masterful Ed Wood. But all too often, despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance, I leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Alice in Wonderland is a case in point. It's a movie where CGI effects rule the day. But the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computer-generated imagery on-screen. Sure it's very efficient and well-designed but like CGI in general, it's far too polished to really strike a chord and convince. There is a distinct lack of wonder in this Wonderland. The otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overly-familiar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world, we are left thinking 'Oh that's Stephen Fry, hey isn't that Alan Rickman, I'm sure that's Christopher Lee and isn't that the bloke from Little Britain, etc'. It consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counter-productive. We want weirdness from an Alice in Wonderland film, not slick CGI and famous voice-over actors.<br/><br/>There is also a dangerously cosy predictability at play here too. Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Danny Elfman – they say familiarity breeds contempt, well that's a bit strong but it IS seriously lacking in surprises and you cannot help think that all three individually talented men could do with taking a break from each other for the good of their careers. Depp's Mad Hatter is pretty uninspired by his standards, while Burton's visuals and Elfman's music are nice but ultimately completely forgettable. I found it very difficult to care for any of the characters in this film, and that is never a good thing. It also meant that the conclusion came across as deeply trite, as we have been given nothing to empathize with. We don't know or have any interest in these characters, so when Alice goes around her extended family one by one imparting her new knowledge onto them, it means nothing. It also doesn't help that the journey to Wonderland has made absolutely no difference at all to the title character's state of mind – at the beginning she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump and at the end she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump. So you are left wondering what exactly was the point?<br/><br/>I saw this in 3D and if there is one thing that this film has taught me it's that I am done with this 'new and improved' technology. I sensed it was a gimmick even before I watched Avatar; now I am certain. A bad film is a bad film, and no amount of extra visual depth is going to change that one iota. It's all surface-veneer, and really that's this movie's ultimate problem, there is nothing of interest within the CGI/3D. A great shame, as the source material is undeniably compelling.<br/><br/>I realize that I am almost done here but I have not even mentioned the worst thing about the film. What was it? It was when the Mad Hatter and then, subsequently, Alice do a truly cringe-worthy little dance near the end of the film. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I half-expected Britain's Got Talent winners Diversity to pop up in a cameo appearance at this stage and join in with some urban street dancing manoeuvres. That didn't happen. And that is, at least, one saving grace."
"SeriousMovieCritic","1","196","305","6 March 2010"," Tacky Bombast - Silly Script - Waste of Talent
","Here is a tale of two Lewises. One wrote a small but great children's book that still delights, surprises and enchants. The other wrote a large, artistic series of children's books that push Christian sermons at us in the guise of adventure fantasy. The first author, Lewis Carroll, wrote Alice in Wonderland. The second, CS Lewis, wrote the Narnia saga. Here is what happened – in my theory – when the light bulb went on above the head of Linda Woolverton, who wrote the original screenplay for the new Alice in Wonderland.<br/><br/>""What if we turn Wonderland into Narnia? What if an older Alice revisits her dream world, now called Underland, and discovers a giant battle in progress between good and evil? We could have a Red Queen's army fighting a White Queen's, a Mad Hatter as saintly mediator, and a lot of Armageddon spectacle sure to bring in the youngsters and spawn a video game.""<br/><br/>Thus is Hell born. You cannot believe the dreadfulness of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland – gifted director takes on gaga script – until you see it. Enchantment has gone that-away. Once down the rabbit hole Alice, played with brave but doomed grace by Australian actress Mia Wasikowska, discovers that her old chums all walk a darkening land bearing Tolkienish/Lewisite names. The dormouse is Mallymkun, the Cheshire cat Chessur, the caterpillar Absolem. Soon the throng is joined by dragons who seem to have come from Avatar. The tea party has 10 seconds to flatter us with incipient charm – its chaotic table and moth-eaten March Hare suggest a Samuel Beckett revamp (that would be a good spin) – before it too is sacrificed to sword, sorcery and showdown. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter shows promise for a little longer – this actor does deranged innocence better than anyone (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) – but finally he too drowns in the Sea of Tacky Bombast."
"sschimel","1","91","136","14 March 2010"," Alice doesn't live here anymore
","I am shocked by both this movie and my visceral reaction to it. Unlike Avatar, which used the 3D technology as an integral part of the movie, 3D adds nothing to this movie. And frankly, the glasses darken the screen so much that the already dimmed image (thanks to projectors that aren't as bright as they used to be) was pretty bland. <br/><br/>Let me state for the record, for anyone who doesn't know, the movie conflates the two books, and adds in Jabberwocky for the hell of it. And back story (19 year old Alice is about to marry the wrong man (she was too old for Lewis Carroll). The Queen of Hearts becomes the Red Queen. And the Knaves of Hearts become a cross between the clone robots for Star Wars:Clone Wars and sow bugs. <br/><br/>1. A bland, blond, Victorian Dorothy Gale lives in Kansas, er, England, and is about to marry a prig. She has recurring nightmares about Oz, er, Wonderland, er, Underland, and falls down the rabbit hole. Unlike The Wizard of Oz, there is really no sense of wonder when she opens the door from her black and white existence (filmed in color, which ruins the supposed effect) to Wonderland. Nor does Alice exhibit and curiosity or joy at being in Wonderland. The actress registers no emotion about anything. <br/><br/>2. Johnny Depp used to be a wonderful actor in quirky films. His movies now resemble the parodies that Carol Burnett used to do on her show. (Sweeney Todd being the exception). He has now ruined to wonderful movies, with a lot of help from Tim Burton: Charlie And The Chocolate Factory was excruciating in its twee-ness. And as with Alice, added too much back story and robbed the original Roald Dahl's original book of both its charm and character, while only emphasizing how amazing the original movie was. This movie adds all of the current techno bells and whistles and still can't compare to Disney's own animated version. <br/><br/>3. Tim Burton used to make interesting movies about interesting people with interesting actors: Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands (what happened to that Johnny Depp?) More Sweeney, less fantasy, please.<br/><br/>4. Why do Anne Hathaway's arms not straighten? What's up with that?<br/><br/>EVerything that makes Lewis Carroll Lewis Carroll has been leached out of this movie."
"walsh_bgd","1","35","50","18 August 2010"," A truly remarkable failure.
","It is amazing that they managed to make a remake that is worse than the original IN EVERY ASPECT. <br/><br/>This film looks like a B movie, the animation, styling and scenery are flawlessly default and most of the movie visuals looks like the designers downloaded a pack of 3D stock models and colored them a bit. If you watch a showreel of almost ANY decent animation studio you will see much better and creative stuff than this.<br/><br/>The direction is ridiculously non-interesting, some short shots are just plain stupid and I have no idea HOW is THIS possible in this budget. There is no rhythm, there are just a bunch of scenes with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Sound editing is retarded with voices overlapping each other, atmospheric sounds are sometimes loud and sometimes non-existent. At the scene where the Mad Hatter gives a speech and makes a riot in Queen's castle the cheering crowd sound behind his speech is AWFUL! You can download better crowd samples FOR FREE.<br/><br/>Music sounds like a bunch of sampled ""ooouuuooo"" shitty, spooky loops of crappy classical music in a default Burton way. Acting is WHATEVER and seems like everything was written and shot in 5 days. The voice dubbing of 3D models is worse than the earliest works of Dreamworks.<br/><br/>There is no drama, there is no crescendo, there is no playfulness that makes Alice in WONDERLAND such a powerful story. There is not a shred of IMAGINATION here. I mean, even the opening credits look like they were done in 1 hour. To top it all, the song in the ending credits CANNOT be more cheap and that pathetic attempt of the final ""DANCE"" - some miserable version of a popping' breakdance is disgusting and is on the level of The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.<br/><br/>Even on a ""woman becoming a powerful individual"" symbolism level the movie as bland as POSSIBLE.<br/><br/>Holy ****, this movie is a humongous piece of an even more gigantic, moronic, generic feces that Hollywood is happily sitting in. Join the feast."

","Adding a little bit of a background story and a few more characters to Alice's adventures didn't do as much as i thought it would for the story. Truthfully i wanted to love this movie, I'm a huge Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp fan. But this just didn't do it for me. I came out of the theater wondering if it were just the mediocre script or the director who had failed to meet my expectations. The best part of this movie is probably Johnny Depps portrayal of the mad hatter who truly is mad. However, Mia Wasikowska presents Alice in a dull manner that had me checking my watch every ten or fifteen minutes. Overall this film isn't awful, but at the same time its no masterpiece, for an interesting film to look at I suppose this would be an alright choice, however if you want a great story and compelling acting, you might want to check out something else, because this isn't the movie you're looking for."

"HenrieSchnee","4","57","89","9 March 2010"," Narrative + Logic + Conflict + Wonderland = Disaster
","Before getting into any details as to why I left the cinema with confusion and disappointment, I want to start with what I perceive as the best argument why this movie sucks: I saw it at an Sunday afternoon screening, so the cinema was filled with kids at all ages, accompanied by their parents. And during the whole length of the film, I didn't hear a single child laugh or giggle. I didn't laugh myself either, for that matter, but how bad must a children's movie really be if it completely misses its target audience? I mean, it's not like kids have that high standards.<br/><br/>And I would have never believed that I would hold this against a film, but WHY did they feel the urge to suffocate this wonderful piece of fiction under this concrete-like ""story"" whose pseudo-Christian undertones were lifted straight from the Chronicles of Narnia? Why must sweet little Alice become a soldier and killer for the suppressed inhabitants of Wonderland? Why must every character get a ""real"" name, every piece of magic (like the ""eat me""-cookies) be explained with alchemy, every place get a name and a location that is reachable by just... walking there. Any coherent narrative demands logic - but this logic contradicts everything that Wonderland used to be about.<br/><br/>I have read the source material numerous times (both translated and in its original form), and again and again I was fascinated by its surreal magic, its emphasis on twisted anti-logic (Lewis Carroll aka Charles Dodgson used to be professor for mathematic and a dean in the local church, so he used the books as both an outlet for his more crazy thoughts and to praise the innocence of a child's mind) and its beautifully incorporated themes - like the idea, that the seconds books story unfolds like a game of chess.<br/><br/>But this is ""Wonderland: Revolutions"", and Alice, now a young woman, must go to war, learn that ""Underland"" (?) is indeed a real place, and the only way to get home is not to just wake up, but to kill a towering demon, as... it was prophecied, I guess.<br/><br/>Tim Burton didn't seem to have any idea what he wanted to add to the Alice-myth that hadn't been done before, so he constantly shifts back and forth between a nice children's movie in the tradition of the original Disney-movie and a dark, psychological thriller à la ""American McGee's Alice"", without ever reaching the quality or comitment of either of them.<br/><br/>The only redeeming factor in this CGI-crap is, of course, the acting. Helena Bonham-Carter plays the Red Queen (or better, the Queen of Hearts, the screenwriters screwed that one up, too), and she seems to have the time of her life. She was the only character in the whole flick that made me smile, once or twice. Both Crispin Clover and Mia Wasikowska play their parts decent and nuanced enough, considering what's going on around them. Especially newcomer Wasikowska plays the confusion and hidden inner strength of her character quiet niece and subtle, and I'm looking forward to seeing her in a really good movie. Anne Hathaways White Queen was also noteworthy for her fragility and confined madness.<br/><br/>But, yeah, this is, after all, a Johnny Depp-flick, and I guess he had it coming to damage his exceptional career by blindly trusting into Disneys Paychecks and Burtons.... whatever it is these two guys have in common. It's unbelievable! Here we have the same guy who played ingeniously Hunter S. Thompson and Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka; he plays the quintessential MAD figure of western culture... yet he is easily out-acted by a CGI-cat. A few years back, the computer animated tears in The Lord of the Rings urged me to make some cynical remarks about the future of acting - but here we have an actor's whole performance depending on the photo-shopping done to his eyes. And, well, a wardrobe and make-up which even Ziggy Stardust wouldn't have worn in his weirdest times.<br/><br/>So, to sum it up: Its a shame watching this material and those actors going to waste for the sake of a ""narrative"" that no one would have missed. It fails as ""dark"" fantasy film, and, what's worse, it fails as a children's story.<br/><br/>The most depressing thought I had after leaving the cinema was: How many parents must have felt relieved that they never read this ""crap"" to their children? <br/><br/>Now I know how it must have felt to be a Transformers-fan."
"Chiyonosake23","1","22","31","29 May 2010"," What happened to Tim Burton?
","Oh...the irony of it. As probably many know, Tim Burton started as an employee of Disney. But his work was considered too frightening and surreal, and soon he was fired. Now this movie marked his return. This alone should tell the story. Face it, we never liked Tim Burton for his amazing skill to write dialogues, for the deep characters he create because (not counting Edward Scissorhand) there were none. We liked him because he was a big kid, with a fascinating, dark, twisted imagination. He had style and creativity. Now the kid is all grown up and became a money-hungry prostitute. Sad and harsh. But true. Sweeney Todd was the first sign and this....this piece of... <br/><br/>By the way i really had enough of Disney too, they ""evolved"" completely into a regrettable monstrosity. Poor Lewis Carroll. And poor other artists you ripped off to make ridicoulus amount of money lately. You really have no shame left? When it comes to nowadays Disney i always imagine a scene from an average high-school movie. You know where the strong and dumb jock terrorises the nerd and when the nerd asks why, he says: because i can, you cant stop me. Yes congratulation Disney, a dead artist really cant stop you from completely destroying, ruining, nullifying his work. You really have no shame left? Sadly the answer is pretty clear. <br/><br/>The only decent scene was the one with the execution. The other were only eye-candy without any hint of meaning or depth. Oh and congratulation for one more thing, you even managed to completely ruin even the ending credits with that ear-raping dumb teenage-pop-rock whatever piece of trash song too. Its not everyday when a bitter and sour cake is topped so nicely with such a disgusting topping, you really done something extraordenary, but at least it was fitting. Tim Burton will never read this sadly, but for what it worth, i admired his work, now i officially turn my back on everything he creates and let the little goths drool about it, they are still young they might grow out of it someday too."

","Alice Kingsley (Mia Wasikowska) is, unbeknownst to her, on her way to her engagement party. Turns out this is the famous Alice who 13 years earlier ventured in to Wonderland. Surely there is a creative reason to pull her back into the zany world. Nope, she merely felt the urge to chase a rabbit who himself was seeking to fulfill a prophecy. And so, Alice in roped back into the world of fantasy/absurdity.<br/><br/>If you've seen anything at all on this movie, then the strengths are obvious. It's Disney, it's CGI loaded, it's in 3D. Everything visual is well appointed with lavish detail. It makes me wonder if director Tim Burton is better suited as a set designer since he is always given projects for his vision. I recall a time where his vision wasn't hampered by the concepts of others, at time when his films were so wholly original that nothing else compared, and sadly he's been stuck in a limbo of ""revisions"" for a decade.<br/><br/>For a girl who can't remember anything, Alice is never surprised. She sees giant creatures, she shrinks, flies on a hat, all without a yelp. The first person to blame would be Burton, since Wasikowska lacks leading experience. Still I wonder what's going through her head when she decided to play Alice as oppressively jaded. Outside the last ten minutes, she's the antithesis of Dorothy. Having a protagonist who's so down trodden in a beautiful world is counterintuitive.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp. You pay the man and he'll do his thing. I can't tell you that his character, The Mad Hatter, is an original. I'm sure it's a combination of other Depp figurines. With the Hatter he has carte blanche to do anything, anything at all, and somehow be considered in character. It doesn't matter that he's periodically possessed by a Scotsman—he's in character and he's Johnny Depp so it must be fantastic, right? More amusing are Helena Bonham Carter and Crispin Glover, the latter of whom you wouldn't recognize.<br/><br/>The White Queen (Anne Hathaway) was in position to be the most complex element of the film. I suppose her role is to assume power in the event that her sister is dethroned. For a character who talks a big game of peace, she sure does mix together an abhorrent potion to return Alice to normal size. Despite repeatedly saying she represents good, I didn't see any evidence. Toes would have been crushed I'm sure, but the vibe from Anne's portrayal suggested that she wanted to be the calculating nemesis.<br/><br/>I can't tell you how stupid this movie made me feel. For some reason it figured a major plot point would be found in determining the identity of Alice. If you are seated in the theatre watching a film called Alice in Wonderland you will not be surprised to find that the lead character of Alice is indeed the very same mentioned in the title. Why we spend most of the film getting to this conclusion feels like an attempt to recreate Hook. <br/><br/>By the end you realize that Alice is the problem with Wonderland. In the 13 years she's been gone, her friends seem to be in good health despite the Red Queen reigning over the land. Why are they looking for her now? The Red Queen was in power this whole time and they seem to be in good shape, but when Alice gets there the queen challenges them. I suppose she's just as upset to have such a lifeless young girl in her land. I for one am disenchanted."

","I was able to catch a prescreening of Alice in Wonderland tonight on March 2nd. Despite some pretty nifty visuals, and jaw dropping set pieces, I found the movie to be incredibly dull, flat, and utterly full of itself. The film is merely a vehicle for Johnny Depp to showcase his talents, and he portrays the Mad Hatter as an actor who can't quite find the right shoes to fill in the role. He rotates from a Scottish brogue, to a feminine lisp, and staggers once in awhile as the unmistakable character of Captain Jack Sparrow. Where the visuals triumph, the story lacks. The proposed 'sequel' to Alice in Wonderland is literally a rehash of most of the finer points of the original, except a lot more Johnny Depp- a character who the audience is supposed to sympathize with and root for, but who i found a bit annoying and tiresome after awhile. The plot is fairly simple. Alice (the stone faced, newcomer Mia Wasisoska whose acting is limited to mildly concerned, mildly puzzled, and mildly agitated) flees from an arranged marriage proposal from a wealthy lord. She follows a curious white rabbit and tumbles down a hole into Underland, referred to as Wonderland by Alice. She then meets a variety of odd characters, most of them familiar from the original Alice. The plot is fairly simplistic, and a tad boneheaded. The Red Queen (Bonham Carter, slightly overdoing it, but arguably the best actor of the bunch) rules the land, but is pitted against the tiresome goodness and light of her sister, The White Queen (Hathaway doing an air-headed imitation of, you guessed it, Captain Jack Sparrow). Alice is destined by some ancient scroll to defeat the Jabberwocky and end The Red Queen's reign of terror. Alice boils down to mere eye candy-something that is visually pleasing, but is only a piece of fluff. If your a fan of Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this movie is right up your ally. I prefer Burton at his best with movies that attempt to involve the audience like Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and Big Fish.

It is that, being the story of a nineteen year old Alice who returns to barely-remembered Wonderland, but it also lifts dialogue and scenes from the original books. The story is your standard journey, emotionally, but all set in a very Tim Burton Wonderland.<br/><br/>Which, of course, looks astounding. Wonderland is an amazing place, often colourful, but equally often ravaged and desolate. It's a treat for the eyes, with the imagination and design shining through the technology. (It's very, very good, but strange things happen if you look somewhere the 3D doesn't want you to look and there's the odd moment of strangely stiff animation, especially when human(-like) characters are completely CGI-ed up.)<br/><br/>Unexpectedly, it sometimes feels like one of the Narnia films (though makes those movies look like accountant-led spreadsheets that have been printed out on toilet paper and left out in the rain), but mainly it's exactly what you'd expect from Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. It's a great big treat of a movie, to be sure. Given that it's Tim Burton working with Disney, it's often gruesome and scary, but not too much. It makes you laugh at times, it pins you to the back of your seat at others, it gets you leaning forward trying to drink in every detail of the place, but it's not ever actually surprising. You know what's up, you know where things are going and you're never shocked. (Maybe once, in a quiet, horrible scene that stands out, even amongst the rest.) Even if you've not seen a single still photo or second of footage, if you know Wonderland and you know Tim Burton, you can picture it yourself effortlessly.<br/><br/>So much of it is still in my head this morning, but it's all visual. There's no heartache or sense of triumph that lingers after a great story. Funny as it is, there's only one line I'm ever likely to quote (a single word). I just have these amazing images left in my brain. In that sense, then, it's appropriately dream-like.<br/><br/>I doubt I'll go back and watch it again at the cinema, but I'm most definitely getting the Blu- Ray when it comes out next week, or whenever Disney decided they should bring it out.<br/><br/>If it feels like I've damned it with faint praise, I don't intend to. It's all pretty wonderful for the two hours it takes to speed past you, but I just want to make it clear - nothing that goes into your ears or your heart ever quite matches what goes into your eyes."

","Imagine having no hope for something and it still managing to let you down. It began with a pleasant waltz through a fairytale, as depicted in Disney's rendition of the brilliant satire-laden wonderment: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carrol. It has turned into another epic movie, simply seeking to reach into your pockets, and, with what nostalgia is left since your own childhood, throw the last of your hard earned money at an utter failure in script and creativity, at something that looked as though it couldn't possibly fail this hard (with names such as ""Tim Burton"" and ""Johnny Depp"". Let us understand a few things here:<br/><br/>-There appears to be no logic process by which the stretching and un-stretching of her attire takes place. It seems that it is simply an idiotic method of plugging fashion.<br/><br/>-The CG characters are the most unmemorable since ""9"" and have about 0 (zero) effect on the story, other than of course, the cat who decides to ruin the only decent possibility of plot in the entire movie.<br/><br/>-Alice causes the majority of conflict (the scratch on her arm) by denying medical attention from the Cheshire Cat for no apparent reason other than her idiocy.<br/><br/>-The Cheshire Cat ends up being the essential downfall, in my opinion, of the plot, wherein I did indeed sigh loudly and wish that I were anywhere other than in the theater; the cat was used by Burton as a Deus ex Machina in order to save (essentially a plot element that discredits any writer by introducing an exceptionally easy solution to a seemingly impossible problem, with no given expectation that the aforementioned element had such abilities) the character of the Mad Hatter, which is so inconceivably pointless.<br/><br/>-For some reason, this attractive girl seems to show some sort of affection towards the Mad Hatter, and he, in turn does the same, which offers up an awkward feeling as this (elderly? I guess that was what they were inferring by the bags under his eyes) Mad Hatter, with his crooked, altogether oddly shaped eyes, hits on our heroine, the perpetually dumbfounded Alice.<br/><br/>-One more easily predictable movie, no depth whatsoever; seriously, no thought necessary once you enter into the theater. The humor is sub-par: half the audience chuckled about 3 times during the film. I do believe there was more laughing during the preview of ""The Karate Kid"" than during the actual movie.<br/><br/>-Expect to hear Alice claim that she's in a dream for the majority of the movie, then change her mind until she becomes so confused that smoke literally pours out of her ears.<br/><br/>To sum up what you should know before the movie, this movie is utterly useless. The script is nonsense in a way that defies nonsense. Bland characters, with an all-too-common Johnny Depp running around as though he's just woken up from a hangover and mainlined dope into his eyeball. This is Hollywood pumping movies out that it knows will make a couple of bucks. For the love of whatever invisible man you believe in, do not see it.<br/><br/>Here are a couple of questions to ask yourself after the movie has ended, because maybe, just maybe, you didn't believe how horrendous it could be.<br/><br/>1. WHY does the Mad Hatter slip in and out of a Scottish accent? 2. WHO honestly expected her to become a sailor at the end of this movie? I MEAN WHAT THE ****? REAL GREAT SURPRISE HUH? 3. IF they could change their sizes using this potion, why do the inhabitants not simply make themselves (or Alice) really big and have her just stomp out the Jabberretard? 4. WHY, just WHY does the White Queen have to, at all times, have her hands up in some stupid position? 5. DON'T you wish you had read a review before going?<br/><br/>Far more preferential to myself and several of my peers was the plot of American McGee's Alice, which was a severely macabre twist on the wonderland we once knew; also, the writers of Alice knew that in order to keep someone interested there has to be a storyline that involved a climax, or maybe, hold on to your hats folks, a surprise.<br/><br/>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466663/"
"d_art","8","141","250","6 March 2010"," Movie Review: 'Alice in Wonderland' is a beautiful world to behold
","Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a sequel and not a retelling of the original children's novels by Lewis Carroll. In this film, Alice is now 19-years old, and soon after the death of her father, is proposed to be married away. Feeling pressured, she runs off, following a white rabbit, which leads her to Wonderland, a place she only vaguely remembers from childhood. There, she meets past familiar faces as the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Blue Caterpillar (Alan Rickman), the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), and eventually the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), who has been terrorizing the land with her harsh rule and beheading of heads. Alice finds out that her destiny is to end the Red Queen's rule by slaying the queen's dragon, Jabberwocky, as written in the prophesy. Along the way she meets up with all sorts of colorful characters.<br/><br/>If you remember, Steven Spielberg's Hook was the live action sequel to Peter Pan. Similarly, Tim Burton's film is very much like a close cousin, except it's about Alice. The progression of the story is also kind of similar, where the main character, Alice, like Peter, must rediscover herself and finally defeat her nemesis. Likewise, both films are both elaborately staged, they are both about growing up and making choices, and there's a big showdown. Chances are if one liked Hook, one will find many things to like about Alice.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's version of the Wonderland's environments are gorgeous, imaginatively created, lots of colorful details, and breathes life. The castles are sleek and intricately designed. The creatures are generally live versions (CG) of the Disney's previous animated version, and they're even more odder and fun to look at. I particularly loved the portrayal of the Chesire Cat in this film, and the way he snakes through midair like water feels very natural, although it wouldn't feel so natural in real life. Only complaint I may have in terms of visuals would probably be where we see CG versions of natural creatures like dogs--they're not particularly stylized so their CG-ness can be more noticeable.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score fits the environment just right, giving added intensity when needed. This film is essentially Tim Burton's playground and even if there wasn't any story, it still would be plenty of fun to just watch the loony characters in their environment. I will add that 3-D aspect of it helped a lot.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter with usual gusto, as he brings much energy and quirkiness to such an oddball character. I suppose there is a mix of Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow in there somewhere. Given that other characters are mostly or completely CG, Johnny Depp's character can feel a bit of out of place, as he still feels human. Helena Bonham Carter as the big-headed (literally) Red Queen is fun, expressive, and extremely likable for such a short-tempered character. Mia Wasikowska is particularly noteworthy as Alice, which she plays with free-spirited pluckiness, charm, and beauty.<br/><br/>The story, admittedly, is a simple one, although it is to the story's credit that Alice is now an adult--it helps since many happenings in Wonderland can be quite unfriendly, bizarre, and grotesque. Thankfully, no more worries about some dream causing some lifelong trauma to some poor child. I also appreciated the fact that her Wonderland, like dreams, is an extension of her frustrations with the ""real"" world, where she felt she had many ""expectations"" from outside forces. At the same time, it's not like Where the Wild Things Are, where other characters are actually projections of real-life people from the main character's life. For example, to read Mad Hatter as an extension of her father feels a bit like a stretch, although the Red Queen could possibly represent her future mother-in-law since they both dislike animals. Certainly, one can merely enjoy it at face value and the creativity of this world and be fine with it.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this world of Alice. In one sense, that may be the important thing, if one were to stick to the flavor of the original novel. The story within the Wonderland, I felt, wasn't as poignant as ""real life"" moments, which were filmed with much love and detail. Given the fact that original story consisted of series of random events and character interactions, it was nice to see the characters work together a bit. The overall result isn't something beyond what one would expect from this style of work, but it's fun, and where it succeeds, it succeeds well, thanks to the consistency of Tim Burton's imaginative visuals. *** out of **** stars.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, you can follow me on Twitter at http://twitter.com/d_art"
"apache67","1","124","219","23 March 2010"," Tim's Ego
","And yet again Tim Burton's ego gets in the way as it did with Willy Wonka seriously thinking that he can improve an age old classic by replacing what he refers to as a mere series of events a little girl stumbles through, with a trite paint by numbers good versus evil story a la: Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Chronicles of Narnia, Golden Compass. He leaves out the magic of the books, the cutting wit, the Topsy turvy absurdity which make the stories so special and a little girl called Alice who's precocious cleverness is way beyond her years. It is not about stifling a director's artistic vision (which every artist has a right to) or reworking of the story but the mere greed and egotistical ambitiousness with which he went after this project, clearly to fatten his pockets. Poor Lewis Carrol is rolling in his grave."

","Pretty terrible sequel of sorts to the famous Lewis Carroll story that finds Alice returning to Wonderland years after her first adventure to do battle with the Jabberwocky and end the reign of the tyrannical Red Queen.<br/><br/>A lot of money and some pretty decent actors are thrown up on the screen in a frenzy of special effects, production design and action sequences that are meant to distract us from how badly written and unengaging the whole thing is. Johnny Depp is given a large role as the Mad Hatter and does his standard weirdo routine for the umpteenth time. Alice is a black hole at the film's center, mostly because the actress who plays her is uber-bland. The only thing that occasionally roused me from my drowsy stupor was Helena Bonham Carter, who gives the film its only laughs as the Red Queen.<br/><br/>At one time I thought Tim Burton had the makings of a great filmmaker. I'm not so sure anymore.....<br/><br/>Grade: D"
"greta_skeberdyte","2","43","71","27 March 2010"," Expect the worst... and it will still disappoint you.
","When I first heard that Tim Burton was making Alice in Wonderland, and when, later yet, I saw the stills and first promotional shots, I could not wait to see it. I decided to forget all about how disappointing Burton's latest movies were, and thought to myself, we'll probably all fall in love with him again.<br/><br/>So when the first reviews turned out to be less than favourable, I was surprised. When some of then were outright terrible, I started suspecting that maybe my expectations had been too high. But nothing, NOTHING prepared me for yesterday's bitter disappointment.<br/><br/>First, the positive. Nice costumes, and I mean REALLY, seriously nice costumes. Dresses to die for, and hats to wear in a dream. And the Cheshire cat who is so fluffy that you are seriously tempted to reach out and ruffle his tummy. And the Red Queen, who is the only believable character with acting worth the mention. And... oh wait, the list ends here.<br/><br/>If Burton had spent as much time writing the story, developing the characters and working on the dialogue, as he had on making sure that the dresses were spectacular, this movie might have been quite alright. But instead, he opted to provide a story so predictable and unimaginative, you have to wonder why it was put to screen at all. And he seemed to have thought that, if the story (or lack of it, to be honest) was not dreadfully bad enough, this could be fixed by carefully adding a cliché to almost every line in the dialogue, and by making sure that there was not a single funny (like laugh-out-loud funny, not a half-smile-OK funny) moment in the whole movie.<br/><br/>Worst of all, he mercilessly murdered the essence and soul of the characters. Alice is lifeless, boring and mechanical. The Hatter has a few brilliant moments and he was graciously allowed a few acceptable lines by Burton, but mostly it is all been-there-done-that another over-the-top-facial-paint-role for Depp. The movie leaves one thankful for the Red Queen – her character would not impress you in any better movie, where she would simply be a decently amusing villain, but here it's only her presence that can lighten up the screen somewhat. Hathaway's beauty is worth admiring, but the White Queen would be better left in a poster, as the moment she starts speaking or moving, it is so unnatural, word ""cringy"" does not do it justice. The others are not even worth the mention, with the exception of the Caterpillar, where Rickman's charisma cannot be so subdued that it would not shine through.<br/><br/>At many points in this movie I tried to tell myself – this is a movie for children, what do you expect. Well, much more. There are many wonderful children's movies that are delightful to watch for audiences of all ages. This leaves you a feeling you just spent 2 hours watching the Mardi Gras carnival at 4 am, where beautiful clad dancers barely even move anymore, their steps mechanical and their eyes glazed over, and the audience too drunk to care.<br/><br/>I went with a friend who said she loved it, as it looked nice. If this is all you are looking for, and if you watch it while playing your favourite album on your MP3 player so as to limit your experience to moving images, you might just find it enjoyable enough."

","After watching this movie I don't want to live in this world anymore. I love Tim Burton's movies and this one wasn't disappointment. The cast was great. Everyone played, they weren't just grimacing. Helena Bonham Carter was great as always. Mad hatter was something, his lines were witty and his dance was the funniest thing ever. Every character is special. I liked this Alice, she's strong, smart and modern. And every time I saw the cat I wanted to be there to hug it. I was worried that Disney would spoil this movie, but I was wrong this is absolutely Burton's movie. The landscapes will make you forget about everything you saw before. Atwood's costumes are beautiful, they fit the characters same is the make-up. If you like fairy tales don't miss Alice In Wonderland."

","The Good: It did not give me cancer.<br/><br/>The Bad: Alice in Wonderland is a treasure of classic literature, and classic Disney. Well it was. That all changed with the latest abortion by Tim Burton. AIW was easily, the lamest, contrived, nonsensical piece of crap that has ever made me want to gouge my eyes out whilst watching it. And I use the above terms of nonsensical and lame, in the most disrespectful ways possible. <br/><br/>Gone was the innocence, whimsy, curiosity, and dare I say magic, of the novel and the Disney animated classic. In its place, a wooden, funny looking actress whose range of emotions went from ""oh, a fly just landed on my plate"" to ""oh, a dog. and it's brown."" Those last two situations didn't actually occur, however, they may have been more interesting than what had.<br/><br/>I am literally shocked. How one could take a piece of literature (and film, in numerous outings) and turn it to ""that"", is beyond my level of comprehension. This proves to me beyond a shadow of a doubt that Tim Burton can no longer be regarded as a genius, or even a competent storyteller. He has become a quirky nightmare with a lot of money and fantastic art director. To boot, Johnny Depp has become an unwatchable characterization of himself, a bad parody, that seriously needs to stop, and much like the director, needs to get back the formula of Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands. <br/><br/>I'm blown away by how poor this film was. I went in with zero expectations, and it surpassed them in a negative sense. In a rating of 1 to 10, I give this film a burial at sea, so no one can urinate on it any more than Tim Burton already has. Oh, and Avril Lavine does the end music. She is to art what small pox is to life. <br/><br/>Let me add, I get it. It was supposed to be a follow up, or sequel, or something along those lines. Something of an homage piece if you will. This was not executed. In the least. The dialog was barely audible and both mixed and pronounced to the poorest degree. The plot was quick, the inside jokes quicker and hackney, the plot spoon fed and completely forced. This film disgusts me. It's everything wrong with modern Hollywood cinema directed at a younger generation, and even to my own. Once again, a treasured tale from youth and fond cinematic memory now has an blemish, thanks to this. Tim Burton needs to stop adapting loved literature. Like, now. <br/><br/>The Ugly: I sort of wish it gave me cancer so if (and when) they do make a (gasp)sequel, I'd be dead long before the trailer came out. Or would at least have bigger problems on my hands."
"sashank_kini-1","1","49","84","15 March 2010"," Alice in blunder-land ( oh wait, that's not the real Alice!)
","What a over-rated, self-indulgent movie. Right from the inclusion of Johnny Deep in a maddening avatar to Helena Carter as the tyrant witch witch an oblong head, Tim Burton yet makes another movie that is barely watchable and completely loony, in a bad way.<br/><br/>Mia Wasikowska stars or rather pales as Alice, devoid of emotion or interest. Her pale, frail look gets on one's nerves as she sleepwalks throughout the film, with an expressionless countenance that feels weakens the movie significantly. The scenes where she is supposed to be brave look rehearsed and forced. In fact, I and my friends got so bugged that we wanted her clothes to fall off so that she could create some stir in the audience!<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway, vibrant and exquisite in Rachel Getting Married, gives a superficial portrayal of the kind and loving White Queen. Poor soul is soulless in the movie as she tries hard to be Meryl Streep or Julie Andrews but falters. Why did Tim have to cast her for a role more suitable for an older actress? Though miscast, she at least tries to make a character of her own, unlike Mia, but looks robotic. In fact, she looked like a typical deceiving hag who would bear her fangs anytime. ""Oh, she's wearing white! Symbolizes peace. She must be the good one"" but unfortunately, she ends up getting wasted. And even though her performance is being berated by a number of viewers, I feel that she at least tries to get into her role. Wish she didn't look so hideous here!<br/><br/>Mad Hatter is played by the outlandish Johnny Depp but he too doesn't cast much impact in his half-baked role. None of the characters, including him, connects with the audience. None are very likable. I remember, in Chronicles of Narnia, where though the main four Britishers aren't versatile actors, but the supporting cast shines. Tilda Swinton was towering, tormenting and impactful. Aslan, though not a real character, still was very likable. Here, everyone is mundane and lifeless. Depp still tries to give his fullest but the dreary pace of the film outweighs him since his performance isn't groundbreaking or any of that sort. And I'm not a hater of Johnny or Tim Burton (loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, liked Timm's Batman, Johnny's What's eating Gilbert Grape?)<br/><br/>Helena plays the Red Queen in a quirky fashion that gets customary and monotonous. She plays the role differently though, not the traditional ones who are mostly staunch and resolute. Instead, she plays a role similar to Meryl Streep's in She-Devil, who gives herself too much airs. She is funny and redeeming for a while. Then she grates because she does the same act throughout the movie and makes her performance one-dimensional.<br/><br/>Crispin Grover is tolerable. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are neither funny nor likable, overbearing at times. The story is tedious and the animation prosaic. The real world characters are so full of themselves and don't supply anything to the movie. The final scene is a bit implausible and rushed. <br/><br/>Well, it was a long, long, unending journey in the theater for me. Certainly a huge disaster from a talented guy. 1 out of 10 stars and a thumbs down."

I like Tim Burton and I like Disney, do I honestly thought that nothing could go wrong. It did.<br/><br/>1. I couldn't find the plot. 2. Most of the acting, especially ""Alice's"" was absolutely horrible. However, the Red Queen and whoever voiced the Cheshire Cat both did decent jobs. 3. The entire thing was animated. Don't get me wrong, I love animation, but you should at least match the characters to their environment (like Avatar did) instead of making it look like a sloppy cut and paste job. 4. I guessed how the movie was going to play out before ""Alice"" even got to Wonder-- oh, I mean, UNDERland. 5. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen and... NOTHING DID. There wasn't an obvious moral or message (or at least not a very good one) and there was no reason for her to return to her own world. And the thought of her ""discussing business"" at the end? No. Just no.<br/><br/>I can't think of a clearer way to say this: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
"azupanda","3","183","351","6 March 2010"," If Tim Burton would have made this film eight to ten years ago, it would have been a masterpiece, instead it's another trite film based on a delightful and well-read novel.
","This is probably one of the most disappointing movies I have seen in a few years. Alice in Wonderland should have been something up Tim Burton's alley, and instead he turned it into something it wasn't. He should have taken over the screenplay from Linda Woolverton (whoever that is) and created darker, more dimensional characters; instead, what we get is Tim Burton for kids. I would have preferred his take on Lewis Carroll's novel rather than a rehash of every Hollywood fantasy film. I thought the younger Alice in the film looked the part of the original illustrations and would have been perfect for the role. Depp ruined the Mad Hatter with his accent and incoherent speech, Burton ruined the Mad Hatter with his ugly costume design. I was disappointed to not hear Hatter shout ""Change places!"" I understand he is saddened by resent events, but even a mumbled, sad, ""Change places"" would have been nice to hear and keep his character intact through a simple and effective effort.<br/><br/>The charm behind Carroll's novel is that there really isn't much of a story, but rather a series of random and always bizarre events that are colorful and imaginative. You start to gain the sense that Alice really is in a peculiar land and at times you even often pity her. With her return to Wonderland the life behind everything the novel created almost evaporated. I say almost because the Cheshire Cat steals the show and truly did save the the film. Regardless, I would have much preferred a stop-motion attempt (The Nightmare Before Christmas) from Tim Burton rather than the use of actors and actresses to portray Carroll's characters. What we're left with because of this is unnecessary, though beautiful, CGI and a lot of it. At the very least the mood atmosphere of Edward Scissorhands would have been a delightful treat."

","I had high expectations for this film, as well as everyone else, but I didn't think it would be another Burton flop. The 3-D was just a last-minute money gimmick; there was nothing jumping out or anything exciting as one would expect with 3-D. On to the movie, it was your typical Burton film, the over-usage of Johnny Depp and Helena Carter, though Alan Rickman is in it, I enjoy his acting, not so much JD or HC's. Also, the way Burton changes the story somewhat bothered me; the Alice-defeating-the-Jabborwocky (misspelled, I know) just ruined the main idea of being in Wonderland, which wasn't even CALLED Wonderland throughout the film. The use of pigs was another thing that caught me by surprise; Burton must've had some of the caterpillar's smoke when he put that part in the film. Tim Burton has disappointment many fans, including myself and I hope that he doesn't create another monstrosity like this, hopefully not Wizard of Oz.<br/><br/>I give it 2 stars for the poor remastering of a storybook classic."
"greygirlbeast-1","10","83","155","10 March 2010"," A beautiful, brilliant film.
","I went into this film without high expectations. I saw so many ways it could go wrong, and many of Burton's more recent films have left me feeling somewhat indifferent. However, all my fears were for naught. I adored the film, without reservation. Indeed, this is not only one of Burton's best films, it is probably the best screen adaptation of Lewis Carroll ever (with the possible exception of Jan Svankmajer's Neco z Alenky from 1988). It isn't often that a film ends and I immediately want to see it again, but that's how Burton's Alice in Wonderland affected me. The cast is flawless, top to bottom. The film's vision comes the closest anyone has come to capturing the frenetic, nonsensical impossibility of Wonderland (and I loved the whole ""Underland"" thing). I'm hearing all sorts of bizarre negative criticisms, though none with merit. This is a bold and triumphant film, one that finally addresses, without holding back, the darkness and complexity and maturity of Carroll's writing. I will add that I saw it in 2-D, and was pleased that Burton avoided letting the 3-D thing ruin the movie, as is so often the case with that sadly popular gimmick. The film is a giddy, hallucinatory, unrelenting dance of shadow and light, hilarious and heartbreaking, brash and underscored, possessed of all the marvelously contradictory oppositions that characterize the source material. For the first time, I think, it felt as though Alice were truly an integral part of the landscape, and not just some baffled Victorian tourist passing through. And the climactic battle with the Jabberwocky...just wow. I cannot recommend this film strongly enough. (--Caitlín R. Kiernan)"

","Having never read the book/s, and only having vague memories of the old Disney cartoon version of Alice in Wonderland, all I knew going into this film was the gist of what the story was about. However different things may be this time around, though, it still remains an interesting tale. Alice isn't as young as the first time she visited Wonderland (she's 19 now) and has forgotten her previous journey, but it seems she goes about doing things exactly the same way as she did her first time around (like drinking/eating stuff that says 'Drink Me'/'Eat Me' - Considering just how ominous that sounds, WHY would you do that??). Her various ""wardrobe malfunctions""/costume changes, as a result of her shrinking/growing, are fun to watch.<br/><br/>Aussie actress Mia Wasikowska, despite what some might say, is actually very well cast in the role of the now older Alice. I can see why Tim Burton picked this relative newcomer over more well-known actresses. Despite all the amazing visuals/weird and wonderful characters in Wonderland, Mia is what carries this film. And a grand job she does of it too. She doesn't come off as annoying or stupid, but a character who's trying to figure out who she is and not wanting to let others decide *for* her. She certainly holds her own with rest of the cast and proves to in fact be the ""right Alice"". Alice definitely has not lost her ""muchness"".<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is actually quite restrained as the Mad Hatter...in a manner of speaking. He never goes so over the top that you can't connect with the character. He does, in fact, give the Hatter much more gravity and depth than you might expect from such a loon. His interaction/friendship with Alice helps ground the film (they're very loyal to each other). While he does have his wacky moments, he also has some quieter moments where you really get to see into the heart of his character. Speaking of hearts...<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter is a riot as the Red Queen/Queen of Hearts. She's completely off her rocker, as you'd expect, what with that bulbous head of hers. Watching her face turn red (as she gets all sorts of mad at everyone and everything), resting her feet on pigs and playing croquet with flamingos is really quite amusing. Her taking a liking to ""Um from Umbridge"" (as Alice refers to herself as) allowed for some great interaction between the two. Then, of course, the Queen lets loose with the ""OFF WITH HER HEAD!!!"" screaming once she finds out what is what. Meanwhile, the always creepy Crispin Glover - as Stayne/the Knave of Hearts - is one twisted individual (he likes ""largeness""?). Of course, by the end of the film, we discover he might not be as devoted to his Queen as first thought (which totally blows the mind of the Red Queen's already swollen head).<br/><br/>Then there's the White Queen, played to perfection by Anne Hathaway. She totally embodies the role of this graceful, peace-loving, slightly peculiar, extremely pale Queen, who seemingly glides everywhere and is so majestic in all of her movements. Even Ms. Hathaway's *voice* is different to what we're used to. She's a bit odd, but that's what makes her so wonderful - that and the faces she makes when something grosses her out (which is especially funny, given the potions she creates - involving ingredients such as urine, fingers and her own spittle).<br/><br/>As for the voice cast, I really enjoyed Stephen Fry as the grinning/cheeky Cheshire Cat, Michael Sheen (who's been a werewolf, a vampire and is now a fluffy bunny) as the White Rabbit and Timothy Spall as the bloodhound, Bayard. As the March Hare, I couldn't understand much of what Paul Whitehouse was saying, but he was nevertheless entertaining (as he truly came off as mad - even moreso than the Hatter). The one character I couldn't stand was that stupid Dormouse! How I hated her, with her constant declarations of ""She's the wrong Alice!"". I was so glad when Alice just TOOK the eyeball of the Bandersnatch from that annoying Dormouse when she dared her to. By the way, I really liked that spotted creature and how it and Alice were a team/friends by the end.<br/><br/>As far as story goes, this was an interesting interpretation (in that it's a sequel of sorts to the original Alice tale). I never felt things got ""boring"" at any stage, and while it did come close to running a tad too long, I feel it ended at just the right moment and with a nice conclusion for the character of Alice. This was the first/only movie that I have seen in 3D, and what a great experience it was! Things literally flying out at you/feeling like you could reach out and touch them/like they were there in the cinema *with* you? Truly splendid. It was visually stunning (as was the beginning of the end credits). Tim Burton has given us a superb interpretation of the story that puts almost all other screen adaptations to shame. I'd definitely be willing to go down the rabbit hole and see it all again."

","My primary reason for seeing this movie was because it was another Bonham Carter-Depp-Burton collaboration. I was timid to pay the 3D price after remembering Burton's attempt at ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (I wasn't a big fan of the movie, like many other critics), but this was well worth the price tag.<br/><br/>I agree with many of the other reviews available online. The visual experience is breathtaking and when this movie is released, it will be well worth the Blu-ray price. However, I disagree with reviews stating the movie had no ""plot"" or ""substance"" or was ""too confusing."" (For those of you who haven't seen it, be sure to pay attention to the beginning of the movie--everything that happens ties in with Alice's Wonderland experience.) Perhaps this is where people have become disappointed: you can't watch this movie thinking it's just like the book or a remake/live-version of the Disney animated film that was produced nearly 60 years ago. You have to approach the movie for what it is--Burton taking familiar characters, a familiar setting and plot, then expanding on it with his own take (once again with the help of best friend Johnny Depp and long-time significant other Helena Bonham Carter); using superb animation technology and phenomenal costume design--I expect to see various ""Alice""s this Halloween.<br/><br/>I give this a 9/10... because, no film is perfect."

","If ever there were a working example of the word ""whimsical,"" it would be the works of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll), i.e.: ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass."" The stories, stuffed with clever word play, non-sequiturs, train-of-thought chaos and general silliness, are not exactly funny, so much as just being playfully amusing. The reader – like Alice – takes a trip of wayward, unpredictable imagination. Tim Burton's film version (or re-imaging) of Carroll's tales likely will never be accused of being whimsical. Indeed, one would be hard pressed to find a trace of whimsy in any line of dialog or overwrought image. Burton's film, while certainly being visually stunning, is also dark, and at times just plain depressing.<br/><br/>Burton has said that he never felt emotionally connected to the ""Wonderland"" stories because they seemed like they were just about a young girl wondering around meeting unusual characters. Which is exactly what they were about. Their unpredictable nature and inexplicable logic is what made them what they were: engaging, if somewhat high-toned, nonsense. Burton and his screenwriter Linda Woolverton have tried to tame the material by boxing it into clichés and a tiresomely predictable plot. He expertly keeps the visuals more or less right – though he has made it all look gloomier and creepier – but the literary essence of the original material has been tossed aside to make room for little that might be considered funny and even less that might pass for fun.<br/><br/>The story begins with Alice, as a little girl, interrupting her father's business meeting to tell him she has had another in a series of recurring dreams, presumably about Wonderland, and she asks him if the dreams are a sign she is going mad. A few joking and reassuring words temporarily puts her mind at rest, but the film reveals itself; the dream world of the little girl is now to be treated as a nightmare world that may be caused by or will result in mental illness. The story jumps a head over a decade later where Alice's widowed mother hopes to marry her off in an arranged union with an upper class twit. Will Alice wed the twit? Duh! The end is obvious – as is the heavy-handed feminism jammed into the story.<br/><br/>Soon Alice (Mia Wasikowska) falls down another rabbit hole and lands in Wonderland – or is that Underland? But Wonderland is now a bleak and ramshackle place, with most everybody living in fear of the tyrannical Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Alice eventually discovers that she is the chosen one, expected to help the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) save Wonderland from the bombastic Red Queen by battling the ferocious Jabberwock. Instead of a bewildered outsider lost in a strange world, Alice is now a reluctant messiah. Few of the oddball characters from Carroll's books have been retained, apparently to make room for an expanded role for Burton's favorite muse, Johnny Depp as The Mad Hatter. Depp takes up far too much of the story time for a character who looks far more interesting then he really is. Worse, a hint of a possible romance between the Hatter and Alice rings false.<br/><br/>This ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't for kids. Of course, the same could be said for the original books, what with their obscure literary allusions and now-dated popular references. Whether for commercial reasons or a sheer lack of imagination, the film is yet another childhood fantasy that has been re-written into an adult horror film. Like the disastrous THE WIZ and Steven Spielberg's overblown HOOK, a gentle and benignly scary fairy tale has been twisted around in order to supposedly explore adult themes. And as Disney did this once before, back in 1985, when they made RETURN TO OZ, a horrible and unwarranted sequel to THE WIZARD OF OZ: they've taken a colorful, playfully perplexing fantasy world and turned it into something unpleasant and uninviting. There's nothing particularly wrong with taking an old literary classic and looking at it through fresh eyes, if the look is truly fresh, but remains true to the original -- as, say, Burton did with SLEEPY HOLLOW.<br/><br/>Like the recent SHERLOCK HOLMES, this ALICE an exercise in dumbing down. Just as the former film takes Holmes and de-intellectualizes him, making him into a rough-and-tumble superhero, the later indulges in victim feminism, turning Alice from being a precocious, adventurous child into a sorrowful, reactive woman. Here Burton and screenwriter Woolverton become regressive feminists, changing a wide-eyed, curious little girl into a repressed, depressed and distressed woman who ""takes control of her dream,"" dons armor and becomes a warrior and ends up being empowered.<br/><br/>And what does this empowerment lead to? She becomes a businesswoman. So much for intellectual whimsy."

","For decades Tim Burton has had a unique vision of the world that's he's been trying to communicate in his movies. I knew 20 minutes into this one that I was watching his masterpiece; it's the culmination of everything he's been trying to say. He finally got everything right. This movie is flawless, delicate, and a perfect communion of his world view.<br/><br/>I knew halfway through the movie that it was the best I've seen in a decade, and by the end I knew it to be among the best cinematic experiences I've had in 40-odd years.<br/><br/>Watching the movie also gave me a twinge of sadness, because the more I loved the movie, the more I understood -- from experience, mind you -- that it was going to leave a lot of viewers bewildered and unhappy. Tim Burton is generations ahead of his time, and the closer he comes to showing us his true vision, the more people he alienates, leaving an ever-smaller core of aficionados who can be moved and astonished by the brilliance of that vision.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp obviously gets the vision. People who work time and again with Burton do so because they get *him*. And Depp gives a bravura, astonishingly subtle performance of an incredibly difficult character. It may have been his finest work to date. But the difficulty of the character will also confuse many people, and you're going to hear about it in the reviews.<br/><br/>The movie, like many of Burton's movies, pokes fun at precisely the kind of person who doesn't get this movie. People who've lost touch with the wonderment of their childhoods, people who are mostly concerned with what is fashionable and proper, dull people with little imagination and even less tolerance for it in others -- these people are caricatured in Alice, both in the ""real world"" at the party and again in the Red Queen's court.<br/><br/>Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a wonderful metaphor for the relationship between Burton and his audience. The theme of the movie is that a few people in the world -- ""only the best people"" -- still have boundless imagination and delight for the truly novel, while the rest of polite society thinks of them as being quirky, off-kilter, or simply embarrassing.<br/><br/>It will take years for this mess to get sorted out, of course. People will whine and moan and complain about it. In time they'll accept it. A generation from now this movie will be viewed as one of the best fantasies of our times: a 21st-century Wizard of Oz (to which Alice pays a brief homage at the end of the film.)<br/><br/>A word of advice: go re-read Lewis Carroll's two Alice stories before watching this movie. No Alice has ever been truer to the spirit of Carroll's strange, haunting and timeless vision."
"buzzerbill","1","12","18","22 December 2010"," When will we get a decent Alice film?
","When a really talented director—like Tim Burton—goes off the tracks, the result can be a spectacularly bad film. (In fact that one can argue that some of the very worst films were made by some of the very best directors). Alice in Wonderland is such a film. Not only is it bad—it is monumentally, mind-bogglingly, brain-cell destroyingly bad. What was Burton thinking? Please note—many spoilers follow.<br/><br/>First honors for this disaster have to go to the screenwriter Linda Woolverton. Her CV is replete with child- and teen-oriented television. Her feature credits include The Lion King, Mulan, and Beauty and the Beast. Nothing in this intellectually and aesthetically underpowered and painfully formulaic material constitutes any preparation for dealing with a text of the imaginative and psychological complexity of the Alice books, let alone an understanding of Victorian society. All of this is painfully evident in her shoddy excuse for a screenplay.<br/><br/>To begin with, the very title is misleading. This film, apart from appropriating a range of Carroll's characters, has nothing to do with the Alice books. Instead, we are to believe that Alice, after her original dream-visits to Wonderland (her subsequent visit to Looking-Glass Land is ignored, even though characters from the later book are yoked in by violence) share the story with her incredibly understanding father—now a shipping magnate instead of a clergyman (as in the original). He dies, and she grows up a willful and peevish young woman, to the despair of her mother (Lindsay Duncan, in a thankless role).<br/><br/>The film proper begins with a 19 year old Alice on her way to her engagement party with a man she has not as yet accepted (Leo Bill, in another thankless role as a chinless, clueless wonder.) Almost as damaging to the film as the screenplay is Alice herself. Mia Wasikowska takes a gracelessly written part and makes it worse. It is easily one of the most tedious performances I have ever seen—particularly when Alice is clearly intended to be a sort of Disney Princess / fully realized Modern Woman.<br/><br/>Let's consider the engagement party. Engagements were serious business to Victorians—one of the great Victorian novels, Trollope's Can You Forgive Her?, deals with the almost catastrophic implications of two women jilting or potentially jilting the men to whom they were engaged. It is literally unimaginable that a family would give a massive engagement party where the bride to be was not committed, or where she could publicly jilt her intended. To anyone with any sense of Victorian society, this is nonsense.<br/><br/>Alice follows the White Rabbit into the rabbit-hole and into the Underland—Wonderland devastated by a war between the Red Queen and the White Queen. I do not propose to synopsize what passes for a plot here, except to note that Alice's Destiny Is To Slay The Jabberwocky And Defeat The Red Queen—which she does. Helena Bonham Carter chews the scenery as the Red Queen; as the White Queen, Anne Hathaway looks like she wandered in from an Elvish domain in Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>There is almost no recognizable trace of Carroll in these sorry proceedings. Characters like the Dormouse and the Mad Hatter have been Disneyfied into cuteness. The only character that still is like the original is the Cheshire Cat—voiced by Stephen Fry. Johnny Depp is lost in makeup, costume, and bad writing. Even the poor Jabberwock is not immune. Readers will recall that the entity was the Jabberwock; the poem, Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>With a dreadful inevitability Alice emerges from Underland, rejects the chinless wonder, and at the end is sailing away as a supercargo on one of her family's company's ships. Witless Disneyfied feminism.<br/><br/>Now, the film does look like a Burton film. It is visually striking. But what's the point? You might film the telephone book with great visuals to equal effect. I have to wonder what on earth Tim Burton was thinking when he executed this monumental, beautifully produced, brain dead excuse for a film.<br/><br/>If Burton had a screenplay that stuck to the book, this film might well have been worthwhile. But it raises a question that I have wondered about for many years—why has no one made films of Alice in Wonderland or Through the Looking-Glass that are in any way faithful to the originals? It is true that the Alice books are sui generis—the greatest works in of all children's literature, unique combinations of psychology and mathematics, each carefully organized around a different set of metaphors—Alice around cards and growing and shrinking and summer; Through the Looking Glass around chess and winter. They are as strange and familiar as paintings by Rene Magritte. They are heavily visual and cinematic. Why mess with them? What forces filmmakers to cheapen and vulgarize them? This film reportedly cost some $200,000,000 to make. What a monumental waste of time, effort, and money. Ms. Woolverton should be publicly flogged before the British Library by members of the Society for the Protection of Textual Integrity and Mr. Burton should wear a particularly itchy hair shirt for the next year as small measures of penance.<br/><br/>It is rare indeed that one finds a film that is so utterly infuriating and so utterly without redeeming features. It is even rarer when it exhibits so clearly the failings of contemporary film—contempt for sources, witless writing, justification through special effects, and no sense of history.<br/><br/>It should be burnt. Or at least shunned.<br/><br/>Save yourself, and avoid it."

","I'm surprised this could get good reviews, especially from people who preface that they're HUGE Tim Burton/Johnny/Alice fans. Maybe they'd already decided that they love the movie before.<br/><br/>With that said, I am a HUGE Tim Burton fan and I LOVE Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass and gasped when I learnt about this movie. Then I saw the first trailer and got even more excited because the characters looked just as they did in Disney but on steroids. But as the release date drew nearer, I started feeling ennui. The director and story pairing just seemed so...obvious.<br/><br/>And when I saw the movie it completely met my expectations. It was Tim Burton's Alice and it was boringly obvious. What I didn't expect was the insulting narrative that they tacked on. It was completely uninspired, the same plot of every fantasy quest kid's movie. But worse, they forgot that the point of Alice is that its plot less. The real Alice stumbles into the most oddball characters that are so immersed in themselves that they don't even notice when she leaves to encounter the next disconnected set of characters.<br/><br/>My heart sank when Alice steps into ""underland"" and she is met by the whole cast of characters and the entire plot of the movie is told to her. First of all, the characters don't ""work"" together, they're isolated loonies that wouldn't care one way or another who is the ""ruler"" of their land. And why would the ending of the movie been show at this point. The whole pace of this movie was very off.<br/><br/>Perhaps, the most disappointing is the mad hatter. The source of much aggravation to the real Alice, Depp's Hatter isn't that mad at all. He's sentient, practical(helping Alice escape), and has strong feelings for Alice that seemed creepy and pedophilic, especially since they seem to be reciprocated. His garish costuming and make up was also unpalatable.<br/><br/>The visuals weren't even that great. Too drab and apocalyptic, without enough respite. Wonderland is supposed to be filled with wonder, but I guess this was ""underland"", which brings me to the point - why didn't they change the title?! To trick people, like me, in watching the film.<br/><br/>The only thing that saved the film was the ""red queen"" or queen of hearts and her court of living things. Her look and Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal was perfection. Her character was the only one I cared about, the only one with any depth.<br/><br/>Watching the film made me physically squirm in discomfort. I found myself wishing I was watching the original Disney animation instead, or the glimpses of the younger Alice in her first trip. This new film was not only terrible, but possibly dangerous. My clueless companion asked if that was the story of Alice in Wonderland, and I couldn't get all my thoughts out quick enough. I sincerely hope, that this movie does not become associated with the Alice of mine and countless others youth.<br/><br/>In the end, I would never say I was let down by Burton. He's an artistic genius and nothing can taint that. I'm just going to try and forget that he made this film."
"Jackpollins","2","40","73","5 March 2010"," What happened Tim Burton?
","So far this year has been the year of directors who are going downhill. From Kevin Smith's Cop Out last week, the good directors making bad movies continues with Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland. Based on the book by Lewis Carroll, the film is too long, too boring, and too bland. From the little known short film Frankenweenie to Beetlejuice to Edward Scissorhands, Burton has shown us what an amazing talent he is. Unfortunately, his adaptation of Alice In Wonderland is just plain bad. Burton is such a good director, it's disappointing that his direction is so bleak. For the first 30-45 minutes, the film is visually stunning, if not still a bad film. The film actually starts out as a really great period piece, but that doesn't last for more than 10 minutes. Then the film goes into a fantasy that is nowhere close to fantastic. It feels like it's just piling anything that could use special effects. Johnny Depp is a great actor, and he's good here but this feels like his same character named Edward Scissorhands, and it feels like Depp should of had his character in that movie. Helena Bonham Carter is the only good thing in the film. She is fantastic as the evil Red Queen. Anne Hathaway is gorgeous, as always, and although she is a great actress she brings nothing to the table as the nice White Queen. The Red Queen-White Queen plot plays out like a really bad version of The Wizard Of Oz. Mia Wasikowska is alright as Alice, but isn't really anything great. An unrecognizable Crispin Glover is alright as the evil Stayne, Boyfriend of The Red Queen. Overall, the film is terrible, and you should do nothing but avoid it."

Also it was the 3rd 3D film I've seen.

","Today, Director Tim Burton's latest film Alice Wonderland was released to audiences around the globe. I was fortunate enough to secure tickets to the opening midnight showing in Imax 3D with Jessica, Danny, and Brandon. Now, as a huge fan (no reference to my size or eating habits) I went in with exceedingly high expectations, and I'm pleased to report that all expectations were met! Tim Burton has once again brought to like a whole new world, filled with amazing creations and visuals. He's managed to take the novel, which had no real sense of plot, direction, or characterization, and develop it into a full fledged story with incredible fleshed out characters. I was completely entranced not only by the visuals, but my the story and characters themselves. The sets, though all cgi, were beautiful, and really captured the surrealistic feelings the novel contained. Now, this film is not a remake of the classic novel or cartoon Disney film, and is instead a continuation of Alice's struggle to grow up and be comfortable with herself. The parallels between the realm of Underland and her 'reality' are contrasted beautifully, both through characters, scenery, and dialouge. The designs were marvelous, really capturing the dark absurdity that is 'wonderland'. Its rare to witness a film that takes you so far into the story, that when it ends you have to take that moment to recollect yourself into reality again, and that's precisely how I felt when the credits started rolling.<br/><br/>In my opinion, I enjoyed this film much more then Cameron's Avatar. Where Avatar was visually marvelous, Burton manages to create an equally stunning world, while maintaining an original plot and characters. The casting as well was incredible, and each actor brought more to the film.<br/><br/>Out of five stars, I rate about a 4-4.5. I could go on for hours about the plot, characters, and well, everything...but I don't want to spoil anything for anyone! I'm open for discussion for any who have seen the film though. I hope this review was helpful to those unsure of going to see it. I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this film in theaters, to fully capture the visuals and even the wonderful score by composer Danny Elfman.

In the end she must make her own choices, not the ones that others set out for her, even if they are different choices.

","Some five years ago I naively thought that no movie director, not even in Hollywood, could treat English classics worse than Peter Jackson. Now, after Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" and Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" I know that I was wrong. At least in the LotR movie you could somewhat recognize the original book - even if it was infinitely dumbed down to the level of the general populace.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has proved to be much more audacious. He did exactly what Mr. Jackson didn't dare to do. He took a literary masterpiece, universally known and universally loved, amputated all its stylistic foundations, and brutally hammered what was left into a horrible mess of so-so CGI and typical Disney storyline.<br/><br/>Do I need to repeat that Lewis Carroll's Wonderland was anything but dark and depressive? The book was based on pure nonsense, and its world indeed felt like a vivid dream, strange but never frightening. Carroll's humor was light-hearted, friendly and never offensive. The characters were silly and never scary. In the movie everything is the other way round. The girl is almost a woman, the dream has become a nightmare and Wonderland is now Underland - a cold, ugly and repulsive place where you certainly wouldn't want to go.<br/><br/>The story is hardly based on Carroll's books at all. Alice in plate armor wielding a sword and fighting a dragon? What the hell? No, wait - seriously... what the hell? The characters, too, had to suffer greatly - in all senses. Half of them are ripped from the Looking-glass world (which is supposed to be a different world because it's from another dream). The ever-sleepy Dormouse is replaced with an ever-vigorous mouse (or is it a hamster?) for no apparent reason. Why is everyone given some stupid name? Where's the Duchess? Where's Bill the Lizard, the Gryphon, the Mock Turtle, the Duck, the Lory? Have all of them been beheaded at the order of the Burton's bloodthirsty Red Queen? By the way, if there's no Duchess, why is the White Rabbit in a hurry? Why a half of Underland inhabitants are plain humans - what are they doing in a magical world? <br/><br/>Acting? There isn't much of it actually. Wooden faces, two-dimensional personalities, boring remarks. Only villains (Helena Bonham Carter/the Red Queen and Crispin Glover/the Knave of Hearts) feel more or less alive but ultimately they are just as boring and repetitive as everyone else. Even Johnny Depp's performance as the Mad Hatter is hardly a redeeming quality. Depp is a very good actor but he's not a magician. He's restrained by this incredibly poor script too and his character has to do things that the Mad Hatter (remember, in the book he was an unpleasant and cowardly fellow) just wouldn't be able to do.<br/><br/>I admire the book. I've read it maybe a dozen times and I really want to find something good to say about this movie. Alas, I can't.<br/><br/>0/10"

","The recent film production, Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, takes a spin on the classic Disney Film. It features many of the audience's favorite classic characters, including Alice, The Rabbit, and The Mad Hatter. The production, is not so much a remake to the 1951 film, But a sequel with an entirely new plot scheme. The Film begins as Alice, a young woman who many will remember from the original film, at a family party, which she later discovers is for her own wedding engagement to a family friend. Later, she sees The Rabbit, running through her family bushes. (However later, we find that Alice has no recollection of her previous experience in wonderland.) She then, as expected, follows him down into his rabbit hole. Here, Alice finds herself in a small room, and drinks of series of potion, to become the exact side needed to fit through the one working door in the room. She then discovers herself to be in a large land, the audience members know as Wonderland. The new film also makes several references to the previous film, and the poem The Jabberwacky. After seeing this movie twice, the film seemed to never lose its luster, because it never had any. The film, including very untalented actors and actresses. (Besides Johnny Depps performance as the Mad Hatter, which I believe he portrayed quite well, with an upbeat emotion about him, even in the most upsetting of times.) However, at times, the movie's happy, and uplifting tempo, many audience members believed it would have, was ruined by Burton, who replaced it with a more sinister, adult approach. The film, in all honesty, was boring, the plot line, very lacking, and predictable after the first few scenes. It also left many questions unanswered, leaving me and many other audience members with many questions, about the ending. Also, towards the ending there were scenes of gore and violence, which many parents may find inappropriate for their children. However, many adults will find the film boring. In conclusion, Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton, is a grave disappointment. It is to gruesome for young children, boring for adults, and even many teenagers see the film as unsatisfying. In my opinion, even for parents taking their children to the film, Alice in wonderland is a waste of time, and money."

It has the usual dark tone which is seen in just about every movie Tim Burton makes while also being a fun and creative kind of crazy (even for Alice in Wonderland).<br/><br/>I guess you could say it was kind of a sequel to the story of Alice in Wonderland we've all heard. It's been 13 years since Alice has been in Wonderland, she is now 19 and thinks that Wonderland was a nightmare she had as a little girl. Like her father she is a thinker of things that seem impossible. Alice is being told what to do by everyone to where it seems that her voice has no matter in her own life. After being proposed to by a man she has no feelings for she once again falls down the rabbit hole.

Carter, as the egotistical mad Red Queen sister and Hathaway as the White Queen (gothic white) sister. has Wonderland kingdom in the middle of a sibling rivalry. I have to admit I wanted to see ""Alice"" because of Burton & Carter & Depp collaboration. Add to that, Danny Elfman's score and Alice (Underground) performed by Avril Lavigne, makes the Movie Soundtrack great too. ***** 5 Stars - Go See The Movie."

","Watching Tim Burton's ALICE IN WONDERLAND was a lackluster experience, and stands for now as probably the most charmless film the director's made. Plotted as a semi-sequel to the original story, Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns several years after her first visit down the rabbit-hole to Wonderland where she meets up with plenty of adventurous creatures who remembers her. Sadly, Wonderland is all scattered between the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter lending her voice and her face on a huge animated head) and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), and Alice is the only one able to get things right by dueling the Red Queen's vicious dragon Jabberwocky. Out of all the creatures Alice encounters (and at a certain time it feels like there's too many to handle), none of them are especially funny or amusing, and the film falls fatally when the plot turns page after page and gets rhythmically less and less interesting before it finishes with a incredibly dull climax. There's no further interest in character than fine costume and make-up (or in most cases, mediocre animations), and ironically on the occasion that the Mad Hatter's (Johnny Depp) past is revealed, it ruins his loony and screwy characteristics by humanizing him. I watched it in terrible and irritating 3D (this will be the last time), and were given a neat surprise when removing the 3D-glasses to find the entire screen blurry and off-colored, which seemed closer to author Lewis Carroll's hallucinatory vision than Tim Burton ever got."

","I can usually find something to engage with and love in any film. It is a sort of challenge and promise to myself to do so -- as a choice in building a life. But this movie was a nadir in my adventure.<br/><br/>The Alice stories are special, special absolutely and special to me.<br/><br/>For many people, the stories are simply amusing nonsense for children, something to be fuzzily remembered in the same way as, say, Peter Pan or a Grimm's tale. But it is anything but. Carroll advanced our ability to speak to ourselves when he polished the story and sent it to us. <br/><br/>One can hardly expect someone like Burton, or anyone making a big budget Disney- distributed project to understand the material. But if you cannot understand the soul of what you are working with, you cannot leverage or extend it. You will need to count on your own talents instead. But Burton's strength is simple: the imposition of disordered fantasy on relatively ordered reality. He has exhausted this and was finished as an artist long ago.<br/><br/>By any measure other than color intensity, this is a failure as a movie. When Depp isn't given a complex structure to support, he can at least be amusing. Here, we have not even that.<br/><br/>What is normally considered nonsense sequences in the books are anything but. Dodgson was the foremost theory of logic in Europe at the time. Based in Oxford, he created the story for the child of the Dean, the creator of the then great Greek lexicon. Dodgson/Carroll was a master of the inadequacies of logic within the medium of everyday language. <br/><br/>All the ""nonsense"" sections are really a catalog of all the strange ways in which logic breaks when it encounters the way we linguistically form thoughts. Many of these parody assumptions Dean Liddell made in his understanding of Greek, mistakes that have saddled us with flawed scholarship on Aristotle and his logic. They are great, great fun: puzzles that even a 6 year old can laugh about.<br/><br/>This is where playful narrative originates. Only Shakespeare, Joyce and Lennon-NcCartney have had similar influence on our everyday thought. Karl Rove, for example, stands on the shoulders of Charles Dodgson's trickery.<br/><br/>None of this is conveyed. None, even though the Marx brothers made this safe territory for film humor.<br/><br/>Even the overall structure of the Alice stories is cool. Dodgson was not a pedophile, nor a drug addict, but he was something more dangerous to his soul. He was a charter member of Oxford's Psychical Society and a student of the inventor of mystical tarot, the self-named Court de Gebelin. The structure of the Alice stories, based on this, is our first structurally folded literature.<br/><br/>His ordination ruined by his guilt about this, he spent the remainder of his life writing a C S Lewis-like Christian allegory, Sylvie and Bruno to make amends. It was every bit as tepid and worthless as this. Every bit as wrong, as offensive to reality.<br/><br/>The movie also mixes in Jabberwocky. That was a poem written years earlier as a teen, to amuse his crotchety parson father, someone obsessed with the perversion of noble Saxon words by effete French. The poem is about the battle between true (Saxon) language and logical language.<br/><br/>(This comment is on the two-dimensional exhibition. I decided that the effects would be beowulf-like and cheaply distracting. I think I was right.)<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
"Sateena54","5","29","55","6 March 2010"," Had potential but fell apart at the seams
","I am going to try to keep the spoilers minimal here.<br/><br/>OK, first of all, I am a huge fan of all things Alice. From Lewis Carrol's books to the various cinematic adaptations (namely the animated Disney feature) to the American McGee PC game. I love them all. So when I heard there was to be another installment to the series I was excited, even after learning it wasn't to be based on the American McGee game. I was, however, a little apprehensive about casting Burton as the director. He is very hit and miss with me. Some of his movies are great (Batman '89, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands), some are awful (Planet of the Apes, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), and some are ridiculously overrated. So I felt this was going to be a toss of the dice at best. Well, enough of an intro, let's get into it.<br/><br/>The Good: Characters: Most of the main characters from the original made their appearances here. From the White Rabbit to the Hatter, March Hare, and Doormouse, to the Caterpillar and, of course, (my favorite) the Cheshire Cat. For the most part, these characters were done very well and you really got the impression that you already knew them (assuming that you are familiar with Alice in Wonderland prior to watching this). I thought that Alice was played wonderfully as for, despite my colossal dubiosity, the Hatter. My boy the Cheshire Cat was perfect and most of the other characters were portrayed very well too. Then there was Crispin Glover. His character wasn't very deep and was kind of bad, but just seeing him on screen was nice. Only thing that would have made it better had been if Biff had been there too. The cast, however, was not perfect. I will come to that soon.<br/><br/>Animation: Not that it should arrive as any great surprise coming from the company that has given us Pixar, but the animation was spectacular. From the moment Alice falls down the rabbit hole you feel as if you are actually right there beside her. It was really quite lovely.<br/><br/>The Average: Soundtrack: I was really expecting quite a bit more from a Danny Elfman score. This one was really quite mediocre. Not atrocious, but nothing really stuck out and I didn't feel the music had any effect whatsoever on the mood. Really quite a shame.<br/><br/>The Bad: 3D(?): I am really beating myself up for shelling out the extra $5 to see this movie in 3D. I was led to believe that the 3D was going to be amazing and something that would rival or maybe even match what was given to us in Avatar. Nothing could be further from the truth. You could barely even tell in many parts of the film that there was any 3D at all. As a matter of fact, during at least twenty scenes I took off my glasses and noticed no change whatsoever. Now, ordinarily the subtlety wouldn't have bothered me. It might have even been welcome. But when I'm shelling an extra 50% for this feature, I expect it to be a little bit more prominent.<br/><br/>Cast: Yeah, the crap really balances out the good in this department. For instance, Helena Bonham Carter was really...REALLY...bad. I am convinced the only reason she got this part was because she is shagging the director. And I was surprised, because normally I really like her. Aside from Helena, Anne Hathaway was a train wreck. She was so bad that it wouldn't surprise me if she received a Razzie for her performance as the White Queen. I really wanted to claw out my eyes and puncture my eardrums with a pencil every time she appeared on screen. Then there is Christopher Lee. Now, I love this guy. I think he is a fantastic actor and what he did in this movie was great. But....he had, MAYBE, 3 lines. What a way to squander such an obscene amount of talent. If anything they should have given Crispin Glover's part to Lee instead.<br/><br/>And finally...<br/><br/>The Ending: Without going into too many details, I will sum up the ending with a simple expression. Alice ---> Eowyn. W...T...F...It was beyond retarded. The entire last act had me groaning and checking my watch. It absolutely ruined what would, otherwise, have been a decent Alice flick.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, the movie was not horrible. In fact, I really liked the first hour or so. Unfortunately, once Alice transforms into the Daughter of Freaking Rohan things turn to @!#?@! If you do go to see this, don't watch it in 3D. You're just wasting your money."
"DailyScrawl","7","26","49","7 March 2010"," Verdict: Lacking in muchness
","Tim Burton's 2010 version of Alice in Wonderland was full of surprises for me. My first surprise was that it isn't a modern adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, it's a Hollywood sequel. This Alice is 19 years old and makes her second foray into Wonderland in this movie. My second surprise was that I was watching an action movie that has as much resemblance to C.S. Lewis' ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" as it does to Lewis Carroll's original story. Rather than meandering around a nonsensical Wonderland in the spirit of curiosity and discovery, this Alice is given a very straightforward (and bizarre) ""mission"" right from the start.<br/><br/>In other words, there's an Alice in this story, and a Wonderland too. But this isn't The Alice in Wonderland. It's Hollywood's.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>Try, try, try as I might, I couldn't appreciate much about Tim Burton's spin-off version beyond the visual extravaganza. The plot was too simplistic and straight-forward. Each character is clearly painted as either good or bad (well, white or red, in this case). Alice is lacking in depth of character. Johnny Depp's unpredictability has become so predictable it's not fun anymore. The nonsensical wit and charm of Carroll's original have been all but removed. But is it a bad movie? Is it not worth seeing in theaters? I'm not so sure about that. It has two redeeming qualities: It's visually spectacular, and what Burton was attempting to achieve with this movie is there, it's only been buried under the other aforementioned weaknesses.<br/><br/>Vision<br/><br/>Wonderland is amazing to gaze upon, and this is probably the most bizarre interpretation of it to date. That's no small achievement and may be enough justification for some to see the movie in theaters. It doesn't feel particularly real, however. It has nothing to do with the special effects—they're tremendous. Instead I chalk this up largely to the small cast of characters, which becomes particularly unbelievable around the climax of the movie, where a large crowd would be expected.<br/><br/>Speaking of vision, I can see what Burton was attempting to do with this movie. He wanted to build a babushka doll of illusions, each one being a new surprise. The purpose of the event in the beginning of the movie, a secret behind Alice's friend's marriage, the nature of this Wonderland (compared with the audience's traditional, childish conception of it), the truth behind the Red Queen's grotesque court all not what they appear to be at the onset, and surprises to either Alice or the audience. In my humble opinion, however, this doesn't quite come across during the watching. I didn't come to see his ""vision"" until writing this review, and the only satisfaction it's given me is that I don't have to completely pan this film. Burton just didn't take it far enough to make it remarkable.<br/><br/>I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that someone will read this review, watch the movie, and enjoy it because they know what to expect and can see that Burton at least tried to add dimension to his work.<br/><br/>Origins<br/><br/>Lewis Carroll's original novel is best known for being ""literary nonsense,"" and in my opinion the value of such nonsense is that it lightheartedly calls into question our preconceptions about ""logic"" and common sense. Regardless of what was done to the plot, I was optimistic that this unintelligible intelligence would be carried over into this new rendition. I was wrong, and am hence terribly bummed.<br/><br/>I recommend anyone with a curiosity toward Wonderland read the original novel. Also, the 1951 animated Disney version is dated (it's over half a century old, after all), but it's still worth giving a try.<br/><br/>How to enjoy this movie:<br/><br/>* Pretend you're going to watch a strange mish-mash of The Chronicles of Narnia and Alice in Wonderland. You won't have to pretend very hard once you're in the theater.<br/><br/>* Soak up all the 3D, computer generated goodness.<br/><br/>* Don't expect too much more than your run of the mill Hollywood fairy tale.<br/><br/>Weak points:<br/><br/>* The plot was too simplistic and straight-forward.<br/><br/>* Each character is painted as clearly either good or bad (white or red, in this case, I suppose).<br/><br/>* Alice is lacking in depth of character.<br/><br/>* The nonsensical wit and charm of Carroll's original have been all but removed, to be replaced with a handful of silly words. This one hurt the most for me."

","Directed by the most crazy minded and one my favourite directors of all time in Hollywood, Tim Burton and having Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, who are as crazy and innovative as Tim is, this is a magical concoction of the classic 'Alice In Wonderland' story. Can Johnny Depp and Tim Burton do any wrong? My answer is a thumping, thundering, resounding - NO. They are the most entertaining, innovative and their movies are just incredible and other worldly. My favourite actor ever is Johnny Depp, I love his portrayal of all his characters; he is a charismatic screen presence who just wows you most of the time. I had read the book when I was a kid and except for Alice falling down the rabbit hole, I didn't remember anything. This was a fun way to fall in love with the story all over again. Tim made Alice a grown woman to help the audience connect better with the story. The dark backgrounds, the hauntingly beautiful, melodious and stirring music by Danny Elfman (Alice's theme song is really enchanting), the cinematography all add to the excellent screenplay. The cgi effects don't seem cheesy, visually this film is a juicy treat which makes one wanna take a bite at that world. The film released here in theatres this Friday (! what were they thinking releasing it so late here? Maybe a summer treat!) and I couldn't get the tickets for 3D because of the mad rush, still it was excellent in 2D. For a Disney movie, this movie was quite dark and it had the Burton stamp of authority all over it. Some users have commented that this isn't the best Depp or Burton film they have watched. They can't make movies which will triumph over their best works all the time, alright? Give them a break, they give amazing movies. Enjoy them for it is and stop complaining.<br/><br/>Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) has been troubled by a strange recurring dream right through most of her life. Now, when she is nineteen, she attends a party with her mother when she is later told is actually her engagement party to wed Hamish Mascot, whose family owns her deceased father's trading firm. Unsure about everything she runs away and spots the rabbit in the coat in her dreams. She chases after it and accidentally falls down a rabbit hole. She gets trapped in a room and the only exit is too small, making Alice to drink some potions to shrink and escape. Upon entering the new magical world, she is greeted by the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen), the Dormouse, and Tweedledum and Tweedledee (Matt Lucas), who question her identity as ""the right Alice."" They take her to Absolem (Alan Rickman), a blue caterpillar, who supposedly knows about everything. He decides she is ""not hardly Alice."" She is supposed to slay the dragon, Jabberwocky on the Frabjous Day using a Vorpal sword. The Red Queen, Iracebeth (Helena Bonham Carter) has conquered Underland by stealing the crown from her sister Mirana (Anne Hathaway), the White Queen. She is informed by the Knave of Hearts that Alice has returned to Underland, causing her to send a search team to find Alice. The wandering Alice bumps into the Cheshire Cat, who takes her to a tea party where she meets the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Hatter is incredibly sure of himself and tells everyone she is ""absolutely Alice"", settling any doubt. Now everybody but Alice have decided that she is their Champion who is going to save Underland from the evil clutches of Iracebeth and bring peace and glory back to the land.<br/><br/>In the original Alice In Wonderland, Alice is a six-year-old girl, but in Tim Burton's bizarre vision she has become a grown nineteen-year-old woman on the threshhold of marriage. But Alice, even though more mature than before, cannot find her way through life and remains quite troubled over the prejudice against women, who are supposed to be all proper and respectful as society expects them to be. In its most basic form, this movie has a moral which tells us to be who we are and forge our own path in the world, not to be beaten down by others views of how you should conform to the society. Mia Wasikowska was good in her portrayal, quite memorable in my view. Mad Hatter is a guy whose emotions are on the surface and he cannot fake his feelings, Johnny was incredible in that role. Johnny Depp was awesome as always in these kinds of eccentric roles, but he needed to give the Hatter something more, something was nagging me all through his part. Helena stole the thunder in her hilarious and dark portrayal as the Red Queen - ""Off with his head!"" That will be a classic line. Anne Hathaway is also one of my favourites, she did a decent job as the White Queen. But the whiteness in her place was mesmerizing. The other cgi character I really liked is Absolem voiced by the amazing Alan Rickman. This is the man who sent shivers down my spine as Snape when I was younger and he is absolutely enchanting as the blue caterpillar. Michael Sheen's voice was unrecognizable as the White Rabbit, but Matt Lucas's double fat boys were hilarious. The Johnny Depp dance sequence in the climax was really disturbing, it was way over the top. It is a great movie which will be considered a classic, a few years down the line. I am in love with this movie, can't wait for the DVD.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Many knew what was coming when they heard Tim Burton was directing a re-vamp of Alice in Wonderland. A visual masterpiece was expected, and it was achieved. The visuals keep the Wonderland feel by not being too realistic, yet not cartoon-y.<br/><br/>The storyline was fresh and unique. Although, I feel Burton took a few too many liberties. And having too many liberties in Wonderland is something that's hard to accomplish. Burton's Wonderland seemed a bit too organized. Wonderland is supposed to be where the impossible and the unexpected happens. I did quite like the storyline, but it seemed slightly predictable they way Burton set it up (i.e. the ""Oraculum"").<br/><br/>All in all, it was a very enjoyable film. Although it had very typical Burton casting (Depp, Bonham Carter, Spall, Rickman, etc), the actors all had great performances. And the visual effects were brilliant. The soundtrack was stunning as well.<br/><br/>I love it. Subtract a star for the unvaried cast, and another for the predictability in the storyline, and you've got yourself 8/10 stars."

","When I decided to pay a premium price for a 3D blockbuster I expected a memorable picture. Besides the fact that Johnny Deep plays a great role as usual and H.B. Carter also has a nice performance the overall plot is dull and static. I believe that because they had to ""improvise"" and write a new story continuing the original one, the quality of the screenplay and plot decreased significantly. Although there are some funny moments and well written lines for the main characters, many of the others pass by unnoticed. Overall it was a nice, entertaining flick with average 3D effects, way below Avatar, and a simple,uncomplicated plot. Also it was rather short since I expected 120 minutes at least and not 100. Finally I would this movie performed below my expectations. A 7/10 would be a fair grade in my honest opinion. <br/><br/>Best, Stefan"
"nickdelopes","10","13","22","6 March 2010"," It's certainly not Alice, but it is still a fantastical work.
","There are different types of quirkiness in this world. First there's the whimsical quirky that the best children's books seem to have. This type of quirk can be found in the Alice in Wonderland books. There's the quirkiness that's quirky just for the hell of it, something Terry Gilliam does an excellent job at. There's the everyday quirky, that can be found in some of the best comedies. Then there's the dark quirky, and this is Tim Burton's domain. Now the question is, how do you take a time-honoured masterpiece of whimsy, satire, and humour; and make it dark, morbid, and slightly disturbing? The answer is Alice.<br/><br/>Lewis Carroll would probably like Tim Burton's movie. It's dark, just like the book, though the book's much more subtle about it. It's twisted, something Lewis Carroll delighted in doing. In fact, the whole thing seems much more related to Carroll's lesser-known novel Sylvie and Bruno, which is itself a rather dark fairytale that goes where AIW didn't go near. Tim Burton takes the books and completely reinterprets in his own masterful style.<br/><br/>As this is NOT the happy-go-lucky Wonderland, you do not have any saccharine and neon colors. This is UNDERland, muted, sad, but every once in a while a color will pop out at you surprise you. In White Queen world, it's so white it hurts. Cherry blossoms everywhere, everything ethereal and way-too-sweet, just like Anne Hathaway as the Queen. She tries hard to be good, and she over-succeeds. When flowers droop, she asks people to talk to them more nicely. And while making a potion for Alice, she sweetly puts dead men's fingers, dead men's blood, and other assorted dead things in the boiling tonic, all the while smiling and holding her hands up daintily. She is most certainly way too happy.<br/><br/>Then there's Red Queen land. The castle has hearts everywhere, everything is red, ranging from blood-colored to the color of a a raspberry chocolate. The moat is sticky red tar, with beheaded heads in it (Off with their heads!). The Red Queen (Bonham Carter)is cruel, using animals as servants and furniture and enslaving various characters to do her bidding, cooing at them and treating them like pets. Everyone must have something deformed about the to make her head predicament less blatant. And if someone disobeys her, she will say without a blink that phrase everyone in Underland dreads. <br/><br/>In Underland, you will find the dormouse, brave, not sleepy at all. Who has a habit of sticking swords in monster's eyes. There's the march hare who likes to throw things. Tweedledum and Tweedledee (Nohow!), the caterpillar (a wise, but obviously drugged insect who insults Alice at every possible time), and the white hare (who is so sure it is the real Alice). Then there's the wonderful Mad Hatter (which fits Johnny Depp like a glove). Excellent acting aside, I must give props to the makeup and costumer for making this character work so well.<br/><br/>Alice is played by the practically-unknown Mia Wasilkowska. She is pale, oh so pale, and way too independent for her age. She seems weighed down by something, there's a fierce gravity to her. She seems to fit in with the dark and brooding Underland. Even her dresses reflect her surroundings. The acting is real, and she plays a dreadfully serious Alice.<br/><br/>Plot is alright, not as bad as it could be. But at times, it lists, at times confusing or unexplained, and sometimes generic. But the references to the books are spot-on and give you an inward smile. The screenplay needed work, but there are moments of charm, pathos, and just overall wackiness. The music is perfectly suited to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>10/10 for visuals, 10/10 for acting, 10/10 for music, 10/10 for costumes and make-up. 7/10 for story, and 9/10 for screenplay."
"schnoidl","1","21","39","7 March 2010"," waste of attention
","Some movies, you know from the first scene that you are going to be sucked into a loveletter, charmed and delighted, immersed in wonder. I wish I had gone to one of those instead. Not once the entire movie did I have the slightest suspension of disbelief, not once did I invest a drop of emotion or anticipation. The CG was some of the worst I've seen, really inexcusable; really, EVERY single item looked fake. The Tweedledoofs were smudgy, all the rock textures were so obviously synthetic, everything was just plastic looking. And my favorite bone to pick, just the simple physical motion was ridiculous. When that big shaggy sharkdog was running, it was so blatantly animation. Even Depp's little (why? why???!!) break dancing bit was just such a weak effort. And the...""performances""? Every single character was as flat as a card, especially the dishwater-banal utterly charisma-free lead. And who was young Alice, some producer's daughter? She looked like she couldn't keep from giggling, like she was the guest of honor at a hugely expensive party or something, which she probably was. And why would anyone cast Anne Hathaway in anything, ever? I find her so unwatchable. And why was Crispin Glover in this, except so somebody could go oh wow, it's that weird guy? Danny Elfman needs to take a break from grinding out his stale goading and reconnect with his weirdo roots; he has become the exact opposite of what he once was. Why oh why, Hollywood? Is there anyone there who really loves movies? I thought Tim Burton was one of them, but this is just him licking a mirror."
"flammable_2002","4","37","76","4 March 2010"," Too much Tim Burton in a Tim Burton movie.
","I was very excited about this film prior to it's release, it went something like this:<br/><br/>Tim Burton's making Alice in Wonderland: ""Sounds great!""<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is playing the Mad Hatter: ""Oh, that's alright; it's a small part""<br/><br/>The majority of the film will be filmed on a green screen: ""Oh...well that's can work. It worked for 300.""<br/><br/>All of my initial reactions were wrong. I severely disliked it. Tim Burton has, for years, walked the thin line of CGI vs. reality very well. This is part of what makes him such a successful fantasy-filmmaker, but BOY did he drop the ball on this one.<br/><br/>A lot of people have complained about the excess of CGI and, believe me, this fear is entirely justified. Nothing in the film looks real. Matt Lucas' Tweedle Dee & Dumb look positively cartoony. Several characters are CGI'd when they don't even need to be. The Bandisnatch is an entirely unrealistic-looking animal. Seriously, I could go on for hours. The 3D adds a small level of realism to it and I'll admit that the smoke effects work well when you're watching it through the glasses, but it pretty-much ends there.<br/><br/>Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, *sigh*. Depp's performance isn't horrible, with the exception of the Scottish accent...which was just bizarre. However, his face kept reminding me of Marilyn Manson, particularly the eyes. I found it very hard to like his character in the way that Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka were likable. With a new look and no Scottish accent the Mad Hatter could have been fun to watch. <br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score was lacking severely. There's nothing recognizably ""Elfmanish"" about it. It has no recognizable themes or glorious moments. Thumbs down on all musical fronts.<br/><br/>Now I will say one thing about it that was brilliant: Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat; he's amazing. Not because he did anything particular new with the character, but simply because Stephen Fry IS the Cheshire Cat. The animation and character design of the cat was spot on and I loved every moment he was on screen.<br/><br/>That's it really. Tim, learn from your mistakes! I know you can do better than this. Let's bring things a bit more down to earth for your next film. Just because madness is a theme of Alice in Wonderland doesn't mean the audience has to go mad watching it."

","To me it is very hard not to give this movie a 10 (I don't like giving away too many 10s) because I find it very difficult to find anything I don't like about the movie. To me it is a masterpiece. The characters are very well defined, the actors play their roles very well, and the movie moves at a very good pace, leaving time to breath, but also keeping you enthralled. Tim Burton is a masterful film-maker, and his films do tend to be of the highest quality (ignoring Batman of course). In this film he revisits the story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (as well as Jaberwocky and Through the Looking Glass) and though it may reflect events in these previous stories, it is not the book that Lewis Carrol originally wrote.<br/><br/>Alice is now 19 and she has been haunted by strange dreams since she was a young girl. She is a very imaginative girl, and her father always encouraged her imagination, however he is now gone, and she is expected, at the age of 19, to become a proper English lady, so is taken to a party to get married. We can see from the beginning that she is not the normal English aristocratic girl, but is fed lies (such as you really don't want to turn out like Aunt Imogen, and that this guy is the only guy that will make her life complete) but she can see that the choice she must make will affect the rest of her life.<br/><br/>While she is wondering around the party, she catches glimpses of the White Rabbit, and is also remembering scenes from her childhood (such as painting white roses red), but when the question is finally asked of her, she flees, and falls down a hole after the White Rabbit, and lands up in Underland. This is one of the changes that Burton has applied to this realm. While the original story was a nonsense tale written for children, Burton has turned it into a true fantasy tale. As soon as Alice steps out of the tree into Underland, we immediately see Tim Burton's touch to this story, with the strange and fantastic realms that are characteristic of his movies.<br/><br/>It turns out that Alice has been prepared for this moment as she is the one ordained to slay the Jabberwock and to free Underland from the Tyranny of the Queen of Hearts. It is the Jabberwock that gives the queen her power, and as soon as it is taken away from her, she is beaten and exiled. I always love a film that ends with the antagonist being exiled as it, to me, is a greater punishment than death. Death is the great unknown, whereas exile keeps the person alive, while forever reminding them of the crimes that they committed (though it is not always the case, as an exiled person can simply burn with rage and seek vengeance).<br/><br/>This film is a fantasy quest, in that the quest that Alice undertakes is reflective of her quest to come to understand who she is and her role in the world. While the events in Underland take place over a number of days, only five minutes pass in the real world, though it is in these five minutes that Alice comes to discover who she is. She begins denying her destiny, and then comes to understand that the only person who is in charge of her destiny is herself. However, in discovering this, and taking a stand, it becomes clear that it was destiny for her to reach this moment. It is then when she draws the vorpal sword, and believes that she can slay the Jabberwock, that she truly comes into her own.<br/><br/>We see this as the film winds up magnificently. The slaying of the Jabberwock, and the freeing of Underland is not the end of the film. Alice returns to the real world, and while some may become despondent in returning to the same old boring world, Alice is not, and takes what she learns. She is an adventurer at heart, not an English lady. It is her desire to travel the world, and to pick up where her father left off. While it may be somewhat unrealistic for her to go into business with an English gentleman at this point in history, we need to remember that she is a lady of high standing, so we cannot have her running off into the underground. Instead she retains the image of the heroine as the move closes with her boarding the ship, taking pride of place, and sailing off to China where no doubt she will face many new adventures."

","""Alice In Wonderland"" is another great Tim Burton movie, but it has too much useless action scenes. The directing was good, The new design of Wonderland is awesome, It looks different to the old Alice in Wonderland cartoon. it is enjoyable instead of creepy, ""Alice in Wonderland"" could be the best movie is saw this year so far.<br/><br/>The main character is always pale in every Tim Burton movie. The effects and The new look of the characters are good to look at. The sky is always cloudy like Sweeney Todd. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter is like Madonna plus Penguin acting like Willy Wonka. Anne Hathaway is weird. It's a great idea to make The Jabberwock as the villain in this movie. The action scenes are unnecessary.<br/><br/>I saw this in a 2D cinema but it looks fun to watch it in 3D. The casting was great. Tim Burton's visuals are the best in this film. But the end of the movie, it makes me feel like i was watching ""Narnia"" but better than that garbage. ""Alice in Wonderland"" is good to watch even without sounds.<br/><br/>4/5"
"C-Younkin","8","15","27","5 March 2010"," It's a mad mad mad good world
","Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" is actually a sequel of sorts (think Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"", only much better) which again sees Alice go down the rabbit hole but imagines it in a completely different way. Linda Woolverton's script is like a blending of Lewis Carroll's books with ""Lord of the Rings"", which is actually a bit like ""Chronicles of Narnia"", only much darker and more eccentrically fun. Enough with the comparisons! What I'm trying to say is ""Alice in Wonderland"" brings an excitement to the fairytale that I've not seen in a long time. Mia Wasikowska does a superb job as Alice, now a teen being forced into marriage. She runs off and falls down the rabbit hole and into a strange world of talking rabbits, caterpillars, and Tweedle-dees and Tweedle-Dums. There are also dangerous creatures as well, like a humongous dragon that Alice is prophesized to fight in order to save wonderland. The evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) has taken over wonderland from her sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), and plunged it into darkness. The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) has taken this especially hard and gone a bit loco (more so I guess). Is this all a dream? Has Alice been here before? Alice eventually must learn to come into her own as a hero and help the white queen and the other creatures beat the Red Queen or all will be lost, starting with their heads. This is thrilling stuff made predictably better by Burton and his production team. This is a wonderland scorched black by evil that still manages to keep a Gothic beauty (the make-up and costume design is perfect), a disturbing darkness (the red queen's castle is surrounded by a lake filled with dead heads) and eccentricity (the red queen's abnormally huge head and little body was a favorite of the characters). The cast is also game. Depp gives a surprisingly sweet-natured performance that erratically shifts into a crazy little giggle or Scottish accent on occasion, but he is wisely made a supporting player here. Wasikowska is the real find, as the conflicted and spirited Alice, probably one of the best female heroines to come around in a while. Hathaway is pure elegance as the white queen and Bonham Carter seems to be having the most fun as the queen of mean. It's also nice to see Crispin Glover, doing what he does best as the red queen's sinister henchman. Burton again makes the fairy-tale his own. I loved it."
"maskath-1","8","14","25","12 March 2010"," Better than people say
","I enjoyed this film, I found it interesting that rather than a remake it was an extension of the Alice In Wonderland books which it seems that not a lot of people realize, the acting was fine, Wonderland was visually stunning, and the characters were good, although I do not understand that when Burton and Depp decided the Hatter's accent would change to reflect his emotions, why they chose a Scottish accent which at times is hard to understand, and the 3D was not really necessary for it only felt like a couple of scenes were coming out of the screen, this film met my expectations, it had Burton's bizarreness, darkness, colorfulness and energy, all in all, a good movie and classic Tim Burton."
"pownedyourface","1","25","50","5 March 2010"," Disappointment
","So I, (like most of the other people who waited hours in the freezing cold for the midnight showing of this movie) had very, very high expectations for this film. Usually being satisfied with anything Tim Burton (with the exception of The Chocolate Factory, and Corpse Bride), I thought this movie would just be awesome! Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, it's gonna be a huge hit, I thought. Boy was I wrong! I can officially say that I am over the Tim Burton-Johnny Depp film affair, so, so over it. Johnny Depp actually became annoying when watching the film. He jumped from Jack Sparrow, to random Scot Accent, his performance, in my opinion was absolutely horrible. The film had nothing special to it, other than the visuals (which were amazing) but the plot just had no substance to it, no explanation, no reason. It just was. Although ""Alice"" was charming and quite adorable, it just wasn't ""Alice."" Bad casting in my opinion. I thought Anne Hathaway did what she could, but her actual character really had no substance. Overall a disappointment, frustration, and annoyance. Looks like we've got another 10-20 years until someone can (hopefully) get it right on this one, and make a decent Alice In Wonderland."
"moviemanMA","4","12","21","27 March 2010"," Alice in Blunderland
","Alice in Wonderland is one of several adaptations based on Lewis Carroll's books about a girl who wanders into Wonderland, a place filled with strange, comical fellows and some nightmarish creatures. We find Alice (Mia Wasikowska) on the brink of engagement to a man she does not like. Instead of facing her fears, she runs away. She comes across a hole, almost like a rabbit hole. She falls in and is thrust into the twisted world of Tim Burton, I mean Wonderland, or as the inhabitants call it, Underland.<br/><br/>She is confronted by several characters, including Tweedledee, Tweedledum, the White Rabbit, the Dodo bird, and the Blue Caterpillar. They are excited because they believe that she is the same Alice who had been in Wonderland before and has returned to slay the Jabberwocky. Alice doesn't remember being there before except in her dreams. In fact, she continues to believe that she is still dreaming. Things get real for her when the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) sends out her minions to find Alice. She seeks help from the Cheshire Cat, who leads her to the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp).<br/><br/>Without going too far into the story, Alice is faced with several challenges dealing with her belief in Wonderland and her role in restoring order to the land. The Red Queen has brought bloodshed and tears to the once harmonious land. Her sister the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) willfully waits in the wings until her champion (hopefully Alice) will take on the Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>Wow. That was a mouthful. And you know what, I don't really mind the story. Much like the Disney animated classic, the story is so bizarre, outlandish, and colorful that I can handle almost anything as far as bizarreness and an over the top story. What I don't like is bad film-making and storytelling. That is where the film goes horribly awry.<br/><br/>Starting with the character of Alice, I never felt like she really cared enough. Yes, she is proper and holds a sense of dignity, but at the beginning of the film she seems so headstrong and opinionated. She never questions what happens to her, only saying here and there that it is all a dream. What bothers me even more is how much she says she cares about others like the Mad Hatter, whom she barely knows! I don't understand.<br/><br/>The look of the film might be my least favorite aspect. A filmmaker like Terry Gilliam can get away with a film like this. Take for instance The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. It has a lot of special effects and green screen work, but there are actual sets and tangible things, as well as bizarre creatures and settings. Burton goes almost completely green screen with the exception of a couple of the actors. It's very fake looking and very forced. Things that should be somewhat natural are distorted. Yes, I understand that Wonderland is a very strange place, but that doesn't mean that a horse has to be CGI. Horses can be used in movies.<br/><br/>The colors in the film were too saturated and gloomy looking. The animated version and other remakes include vibrant colors as well as dark, and gloomy ones. Here we see very dark blues, bloody reds, and jungle greens. A lot of overcast skies and grey looking sets. The real world looks more vibrant than Wonderland.<br/><br/>The acting too was a bit off as well. Depp's character is supposed to be crazy, but I think he goes a little too far with the accents. I liked his enthusiasm, but was not completely sold. The White Queen was a confusing character. She was almost floating around, holding her arms above her hips like a fairy. I was never sure what to make of her. She seemed so fake. As I mentioned before I thought that Mia as Alice was a bit boring. Her face did not have much emotion, though she looked perfect for the part. I wanted more out of her.<br/><br/>Had I watched this film in standard 2D I would have probably given it a much worse review. The 3D visuals do help make the film look better, but it should make it look amazing. The colors popped a slightly, but were I to watch it in 2D the foreground and background would almost certainly blend together, creating a very flat and uninteresting surface.<br/><br/>I didn't have high hopes for this film and still I was disappointed. I wanted more from the actors (though the voice acting was pretty good, especially Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat) and I was hoping for a more pleasant looking Wonderland. A word of warning for those planning on taking young ones to the film: the PG rating is very lenient. There is a lot of disturbing and frightening imagery that could upset children. There is some eye plucking, head rolling, and some scary looking creatures. It could be too much to handle. I'm sure Disney pushed hard for the friendlier rating, but don't be fooled."
"ryshpr","9","17","32","10 March 2010"," A brilliant new take on a classic story.
","If you're interested in seeing Alice In Wonderland because you love the classic story, perhaps this isn't for you. Tim Burton's version is quite different to the classic Lewis Carroll and Disney versions in that the story is more or less completely different.<br/><br/>The film follows Alice, now nineteen, as she returns to Underland, although she believes her first trip to the magical place was all a dream. All the classic characters are there: Matt Lucas as both Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen, Anne Hathaway as the White Queen and, of course, the outstanding Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter.<br/><br/>The film itself is pretty much 95% CGI, which gives it the 'Wonderland' look. It's simply a brilliant film to look at, nothing looks too 'computerised', even when taking into account the drastically varied heights of the characters compared to the actors portraying them. The acting highlights for me were Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter. They are by far the funniest characters, even if Hathaway's White Queen may not be intended to be all that amusing.<br/><br/>As for the 3D aspect, as with most other productions being released in the format in recent months, it brings a bit more charm to the scene. Nothing too gimmicky is there either.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend a trip to your local cinema to see Alice In Wonderland, but make sure you see it in 3D for that little extra magic. Tim Burton really can do no wrong.<br/><br/>http://ukmore.tk/"
"chi-cerca-trova","4","24","48","7 March 2010"," Ultimately, unfocused
","This is one of those seemingly match made in heaven. Tim Burton, with his incredible ability to make Gothic imagery not dark and forbidding, takes on the classically twisted tale of Alice in Wonderland. Throw behind him his regular standbys and a blank check from Disney, and we should see something awe inspiring and as timeless as his earlier work...<br/><br/>Or so the theory goes. Ultimately, what we end up with is the imagery of Tim Burton, but not the soul. The movie looks fantastic. The effects blend very well together, and allows it to look cartoony without being over the top.<br/><br/>But, at the end of this movie, you feel incomplete. True, the story line resolves itself. But, there's not gratifying feeling that you usually get from his movies. When Edward Scissorhands finished, you felt content. Not the storybook ending you would have wanted, but felt like you were told a complete story. Here, the end feels forced, like a grandiose commentary on individuality and blazing your own path that never set the conflict up for it in the first place.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham-Carter both give well enough turns here, but they only fill out the roles that they have become type-casted for. Johnny Depp obviously relishes the eccentric roles, as well as Helen Bonham-Carter. But eccentric doesn't mean bombastic, and unfortunately the two of them just chew scenery for the sake of it.<br/><br/>I hope they all find what they are missing. The four of them, that's including Danny Elfman, are wonderfully talented. But, this movie was too big, too unfocused. Tim Burton and gang need to return to the smaller, character driven movies that built their respective careers. Because, Tim Burton's imagination is fantastic, and he is a great film maker when he is focused."
"gauravchauhan","3","11","19","13 April 2010"," A terrible trip down the rabbit hole
","Probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, so much so that I decided to write a review to save a few people from watching it. The storyline is pretty standard evil queen ruling over Underland with an iron hand and a dragon to boot (Helena carter does admirably), Alice who is now in her late teens is brought into Underland via the rabbit hole again to save the day. The visual effects are great, but what disappoints is the storyline at no point is it engrossing and it does nothing to immerse you in a magical world of fantasy. Depp is a great actor and has phenomenal range however here he just irritates you with his ramblings, so do a lot of other characters Helena Carter is too squeaky and you really want a mute button whenever she raises her voice (which is far too often), Hathaway as the white queen is as aptly described by the actress herself as "" Happy Bunny holding a knife"" she does nothing for the character and looks confused and vacant most of the time. Mia Wasikowska as Alice tries to put in a credible performance but really there is far too much going going wrong with the movie for any actor to salvage. To summarize watching the movie is like getting stuck in a bad dream in slow motion its agonizingly painful. You keep asking yourself did Mr Burton even bother to see the finished product post shooting before unleashing it on the world. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this disaster."

"abrown975","6","5","7","17 July 2010"," In this case, I don't think the problem is with Tim Burton, but with Disney
","I saw the trailers for this movie and I knew this movie had potential. Tim Burton was directing, for God's sake! So I went to go see it. It started out okay, although Mia Wasikowska as Alice was very dull. I understood that Alice was always an introverted, pensive character, but that doesn't mean she has to wear a straight face the whole movie. But I can let that one slide. The scenery was terrific, as all Tim Burton movies are. The Queen of Hearts was brilliantly played by Helena Bonham Carter, and I think her performance was the best. The characters Alice met on the way all had personality, but that's when Johnny Depp came along as the Mad Hatter. Johnny Depp gives personality to all of the characters he plays, but this one I think had too much personality. I say that because his makeup is just creepy (creepier than Willy Wonka's) and a little over the top. It honestly made me think of a three-year-old putting on every gloss and powder she could find (and lots of it) so she could be like her mommy. Aside from the makeup, it also sounded as if Mr. Depp kept switching accents from British to Scottish, like he couldn't make up his mind. So I think his character was a little over the top, but I didn't let that ruin the movie for me. After all, there was more to the story. Anne Hathaway came into the picture as the Queen's sister, who was okay in her performance, but came off as a little dazed at points. But for the most part, she did fine. So you're probably asking ""So what made the movie so bad?"" The futterwacking scene (I'm not sure if that's how you spell it). Yes, the scene where Johnny Depp's character, for some reason, just starts to dance in what seemed like break dancing and just wiggling his legs. And if that wasn't bad enough, the music sounded like a mixture of hip hop, Celtic, and renaissance. That whole scene turned my review from an 8/10 to a 6/10 because it just seemed so dorky and Disney-like (remember way back when we used to consider that a good thing?). It was unneeded and made the movie just seem babyish. I honestly am starting to hate the Disney corporation because in most of their movies they have to make someone or something break dance. We have already seen break dancing guinea pigs, pigs, wildebeests, and now Mr. Depp. But, believe it or not, I don't think Tim Burton would deliberately put that in any of his movies. So this movie would be a whole lot better if Mr. Burton steered clear of Disney so his film wouldn't be ""kiddie-fied"". The end finally came and I left with nothing but the dance scene in my mind, just wondering what idiot thought that would be a good idea to put that scene in the movie. Disney needs to stop making things dance disco or break dance and they need to stop making movies about strange animals. And Tim Burton needs to stay away from them because they dilute his talents, along with Mr. Depp's. Other than that, this movie was okay. Not bad or great, just okay. Mr. Burton, I hope you have learned your lesson to stay with Warner Brothers."
"tuppen2010","5","22","44","6 March 2010"," Too little wonder in Wonderland
","Burton seems to have strayed too far from wonderland. He gives us some magical effects and a degree of mild peril. But where is the wonder? Where is the danger? I had hoped for the kind of nightmarish vision that Carroll evokes, interpreted for the 21st century, but the world that Burton has created is far closer to the Disney 1950s animated version. Helena Bonham Carter gives a good turn as the Red Queen (clearly basing her performance on Miranda Richardson's magnificent 'Queenie' from Blackadder), though Johnny Depp is a big disappointment. Yes, his mad hatter is clearly mad, but to what effect? It felt as if Dick Van Dyke was impersonating a cross-dressing Scotsman. Best of the 'voices' without a doubt is Alan Rickman's perfectly unsettling caterpillar. <br/><br/>Burton's reimagining of Alice is also annoying. I like the fact that Alice is now on the verge of womanhood, and that her sexual/romantic confusion comes into play, but Burton really misses the opportunities that this set-up provides. Instead he tries to turn her into a 21st century hero. Great that she is given a bit of gumption, but did he have to give her balls, too? As a number of scenes at the end of the film make clear, Alice is not capable of being strong and powerful as a woman - she has to turn herself into a man (the final image even has her wearing a tie). Had the film been more intelligent, I would like to have thought that this was Burton's way of describing the lot of Victorian women, instead it just feels like a backfiring attempt at clumsy feminism. <br/><br/>Burton would have done well to take a look at the 1903 film of Alice in Wonderland which has become a YouTube phenomenon. This film is truly unsettling and magical in equal parts and despite its disjointed nature, conjures up Wonderland perfectly."
"bocelli_fan","9","15","28","9 March 2010"," Fantastic
","Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Tim Burton. I have seen several people bash this movie with phrases such as, ""I hate Tim Burton."" If you hate Tim Burton films, it follows logically that you won't like this one, either. I went into the theater hoping for something amazing, and this movie certainly lived up to my expectations. The dialogue was witty, the effects were beautifully done. The colors used throughout the movie really added to the story, from the bloody red of the Red Queen's castle to the charred black of parts of Underland. The music, composed by Danny Elfman, was an excellent complement to the film, adding to the mood without being distracting. The camera work was also great, with the subtle angles I expect now from a Burton film. I WILL say that it is likely that the 3D version will be hindered by this. I saw the RealD version, but I would imagine 3D would be annoying. Finally, the acting was great. Depp really brought the Mad Hatter to life in a way only he could - with the crazy aspects of Jack Sparrow and the quiet concern shown in his more serious roles. Bonham-Carter created the callous insanity of the Red Queen the same way she did Mrs. Lovett. Hathaway managed to create a ""good"" character who was, in her own way, nearly as mad as the Hatter. And of course, Wasikowska managed to portray both sides of Alice - the scared, confused girl and the confident fighter. All in all, I give it 9 stars and will definitely be buying this as soon as it comes out. Finally, to those who are iffy about seeing the movie because of the dance, know this: it is at most 30 seconds long and had been mentioned and promised numerous times throughout the film. It wasn't the completely random, movie-wrecking scene that many critics are portraying it as."
"ncoviell","5","9","15","27 March 2010"," Alice in Heartlessland
","As one of the first Blockbuster's and a 3-D stunner, ""Alice in Wonderland"" once again saw the joining of an odd, remarkable story with oddball director Tim Burton. With few mishaps in his directorial career, early signs had to be positive concerning the Burton directed ""Wonderland;"" however, something somewhere along the lines went wrong; very wrong. As is come to be expected from a Burton film, ""Alice in Wonderland"" featured a story that one could only believe in their dreams mixed together with nutty humor and overbearingly bleak and dark themes, yet at the same time Burton's films have come to realize a strong sense of heart and togetherness, which is something that ""Alice in Wonderland"" lacks.<br/><br/>In the revamped ""Wonderland,"" Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is concerned by a recurring dream that she had previously experienced when she was nine. Upon attending a party, she finds out that it is an engagement party for her and she is expected to be wed. Alice, under the uncertainty of the entire matter, runs off to follow a rabbit that she had spotted earlier into the woods and ends up falling down a hole at the base of an old tree. Alice soon finds herself back in Wonderland (although she doesn't seem to recognize or remember it at first) and surrounded by extraordinary figures such as The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Alice is informed that the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) has taken control of Wonderland and has done terrible injustices. She is then dropped with the bombshell that she is in fact the Alice that is destined to slay the Jabberwocky, which will put an end to the Red Queen's horrible reign.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Alice ""finds herself"" in Wonderland and brings about numerous self-revelations. Her relationship with the Mad Hatter is a well made parallel to her father and their scenes together are among the best written, shot and directed in the films. Sadly, the emotion, heart and connection really end there. Whereas Burton has excelled in the past, he simply cannot make up for the poorly written story, characters and script. For a Burton film, the exotic characters of Wonderland actually come out to be quite dulled down, almost lifeless and, dare I say it, underutilized. ""Alice in Wonderland"" simply lacks the heart needed to pull the audience in. After a familiar Disney ending, Alice is left with a decision whether to stay in Wonderland or return to her home. While it appears to be a rather difficult decision for Alice, the story does not support it. There should be a special connection between Alice, Wonderland and its characters, yet that connection is unmistakably missing. Aside from the Hatter and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), Alice did not seem to form any special connection with Wonderland at all.<br/><br/>The writer of ""Alice in Wonderland,"" Linda Woolverton, appeared to be in over her head. Her previous work such as Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King contain their instances of peril and shades of darkness, but cannot match the level that is usually represented in a Burton directed film. In fact, Woolverton's screenplay lacked the essentials to make ""Alice in Wonderland"" work: the script was lackluster, dreary, uneventful, drawn out and downright boring and the wackiness that is brought with the title ""Alice in Wonderland"" was limited. Eventually, the story does pick up, but it ends with a rather brief, anticlimactic battle between good and evil and its final scenes are completely unnecessary. The end result is an empty feeling left in the viewer's heart as its visuals exceeded expectations and fulfilled the magical Wonderland, but its story and characters seem almost cold and distant. The distance is like a barrier that disallows the characters to connect and win the hearts of the audience.<br/><br/>""Alice in Wonderland"" does contain its brighter areas as it features yet another amazing example of cinematic visual euphoria and several strong performances from its dedicated cast. Opening in 3-D, ""Alice in Wonderland"" was a smashing success and brought Wonderland to life. (Such a shame the writing could not mirror that.) Burton regular Johnny Depp once again portrays his wacky side, although it seemed the Hatter was written less mad than need be. Another Burton regular, Helena Bonham Carter, stole each and every scene she was in playing the dastardly, yet unintentionally funny Red Queen; by far the highlight of the film. Lastly, as Alice, Mia Wasikowska more than holds her ground and does the best job that she can as the overwhelmed and confused nineteen year old girl. <br/><br/>Whether it be that Burton's dark tone didn't match with the thought-to- be colorful Wonderland or that it was simply the inadequate writing that did it in, ""Alice in Wonderland"" leaves the audience wanting more, but not in a good way. Its characters do their best to bring some life to the otherwise lifeless Wonderland, but sadly the heart just is not there when it needs to be and is a fatal fracture to a story that relies so heavily on exactly that. Its story and interactions are boring and make the rather short movie seem twice as long as it really is. It is almost depressing to see a story such as this fall to such a low, but for the viewer's sake, especially those enchanted by the majesty of the 1950's classic, everyone should avoid falling in that hole by the base of the old tree because there is no magic in this Wonderland."

So, while I maintain that the films first 20 minutes or so fly by, I don't find it too be too fast that one misses any important information.<br/><br/>The next thing that I want to move onto is...folks...this is a kids movie. It's Alice in Wonderland. So if you're expecting Sleepy Hollow, or Big Fish, or one of Burton's darker more adult themed films...just get it out of your head. With that being said..I understand Burton's ability to make masterful children's movies...aka Nightmare Before Christmas. And for some this Alice may never reach those standards. In closing this part of my review I'd just like to express how envious of the kids today who get to grow up with a version of Alice in Wonderland this creative.<br/><br/>On with my review...this movie rocks. The performances are spot on for each character. Anne Hathaway's White Queen is a spoiled rotten hippie. Through some back story cleverly thrown into the film (not shown through constant flashbacks) we discover she clearly was the favored child growing up, the other sister being the Red Queen. As an adult she still gets everything she wants, but puts a cap on herself by following peaceful guidelines.<br/><br/>Helena's Red Queen is pretty awesome. She's not entirely overwhelming like she could have been. There was a lot of room for her to just be a screaming b**** the whole time..but she uses her fear tactics in a more composed manner with a perfectly delivered, ""Off with there heads,"" scattered throughout. Also, her big head was awesome.<br/><br/>Depp's Mad Hatter is amazing. I had an ""argument"" with my girlfriend where she stated that he was the same in this as in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I couldn't disagree more. Granted both are zany (yes I used the word zany) characters...Both have differences in mannerisms, voice, and depth. I've read that some people think he phones in his performance, but with roles like these there is no way that could be pulled off. His Hatter is an emotional and mental mess. He's someone who is struggling with his insanity. At times, he can laugh it off with a joke, but other times he is afraid of his madness..unsure of his ability to keep himself in control. I think His performance in this is brilliant...and I don't like to use that word a lot.<br/><br/>Mia's Alice is another one that people are complaining about, but again, I don't agree with. People are saying she's lame or dull. That she comes across as boring and stiff. Have you ever been 19? Throughout time, it is commonly known that kids go through some changes around that age. Not like puberty...but just with becoming an adult, but still being depended on older adults around you. I think her performance was spot on. You can tell she grew throughout the story, not just because the script says so, but you can tell through her wounds, her smile, her glow, as she returns from Underland. <br/><br/>The additional computer created characters were also incredible. They all seemed like they were actually there. Sure they obviously didn't look 100% real, but it was like watching a live action cartoon. The visual effects people did a top notch job creating this beaten world that was once magical, but has been torn apart over the years. I also need to shout out to Glover's Knave of Hearts. His intensity is apparent even while having been on stilts and having his body be computer altered. The IMAX 3D was fun. It added some perspectives and depth to the images...which is extra awesome in a Tim Burton world. But I'd say that the 3D doesn't make or break the film. Everything else in the film can stand on its own without the 3D as a crutch. <br/><br/>Finally, the script. That is the big thing I keep reading is that it's all visual and no substance. I don't even know where that is coming from. To me...a script is bad when my focus is pulled by how terrible the dialogue is. That never happened once during this. Also, the story line is interesting to me. It's no longer Alice going from place to place being like...""Wow! I'm the only normal one here! I wanna go home"" She goes home. The End. This time they decided to make an adventure out of her trip and I thought that it was well thought out and executed. <br/><br/>While not being Tim Burton's best work, it is far far from his worst. I was entertained and I am looking forward to seeing it again!"

","If you want to see a movie that remains in the real world and is sensible don't go see a Tim Burton movie. The images are whimsical, sometimes dark, unexpected and beautiful. It is strange in a genius way.<br/><br/>I do like my fair share of non-fantasy movies, but sometimes a person wants to reevaluate reality through the lens of fantasy, that is what this movie does. People have been criticizing the script for being slow and I found that mostly adults or more straight laced types of people take that position. The massive group of about 7 or 8 year old's in front of me and my friend (we are in our 20's) were entranced just as much as us. The thing about the movie is you have to be willing to let the story take you in or you will be bored. The visuals are magnificent and are supposed to guide you along in the story. People who have difficulty with imagination and weirdness are not going to enjoy it, simple as that. It is a movie that teaches you a little insanity is good. Something that I think we should teach our kids. Its a good movie for someone who can appreciate quirkiness."
"DICK STEEL","9","9","15","6 March 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Alice in Wonderland
","I nearly laughed out loud at the family of three seated beside me, as the dad loudly remarked that they are probably the only persons in the hall who have read Lewis Carroll's books Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and the follow up Through the Looking Glass. It's one thing to try and brag to all around that they are well read and learned, and it's another actually to know that it's probably not Tim Burton's style to adapt a classic to the T, given various adaptations from print to screen thus far. The characters are clearly from both books with events vaguely resembling what was read before, but this film is a totally different ballgame altogether.<br/><br/>In some ways, the narrative screenplay that Linda Woolverton adapted seemed to be more in line with Steven Spielberg 1991's effort Hook, which had Robin Williams star as Peter Pan in the retelling of the J.M. Barrie character, only that Pan had grown up, and had forgotten his roots and experiences in Never Never Land. While the characters in that world clearly remembered him (although older, pudgier and without the ability to fly), much of the story explored how Pan had to rediscover his touch and memories of the place he once called home.<br/><br/>Which to Alice, played by the relative fresh and ethereal looking Mia Wasikowska, the audience joins her in that similar route to discovery, and we're left wondering really, like the rest of the characters, whether we're all mistaken if this Alice was the same as the one we grew up with, the wide eyed child who flitted from one random event to another in Underland, encountering fantastical characters such as talking animals, to jealous kings and queens. It's not quite how we remembered it to be, and Tim Burton also showed glimpses of how it would look like if he had played this movie straight, but that would be losing a lot of fun that had found its way to his vision, so much so that he provides such a trippy ride, you'd wonder who was more loony, Burton, or Carroll himself.<br/><br/>In fact, every character here seemed a little mad or come with that tinge of insanity, even the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) herself seemed a little bit over the top in her all white goodness. And the host of characters we come to love, such as the constantly grinning Cheshire cat, the twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the rabbit with the watch, and plenty of card soldiers now given a bit more flesh, all make a cinematic comeback thanks to the wonderful world of computer graphics, and 3D technology to make them all pop out of the screen vividly. While there were plenty of specially crafted 3D moments to enhance the visual storytelling (the final battle scene involving Alice being the most outstanding I've seen thus far), kudos also went to the wealth of British talent roped in for roles both in the flesh, CG enhanced or providing voices to their graphical representation, with the likes of Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Christopher Lee and even Michael Gough, who had collaborated with Tim Burton before.<br/><br/>And this film, like most of Burton's others, comes the return of long time collaborators Danny Elfman in music, Helena Bonham Carter having a field day as the ridiculously evil Red Queen with her big head being the butt of most jokes, and Johnny Depp, who wows in yet another unorthodox role as The Mad Hatter, given more screen time and more depth compared to the novels. We know how outlandish Depp can become each time he's in a Tim Burton film, and Alice in Wonderland is no different, but surprise surprise, Mia Wasikowska's performance as the titular character got curiouser and curiouser as the film went along, which is a good thing since she delivered enough not to be overawed by her co-stars, and stood her ground in making the character her own.<br/><br/>She's quite the clotheshorse too, given the opportunity to showcase some Underland fashion sense no thanks to her changing body size. She becomes quite the reluctant blonde messiah to Underland whose presence rings forth the prophecy in the change of ruler-ship. In her own world, we see how she's quite the stubborn girl who is a far cry from societal demands of fulfilling one's role as a dutiful young wife to a rich lord (thanks to her good looks), taking off during a surprise proposal ceremony in order to follow the white rabbit. Mia Wasikowska fit the bill as this headstrong girl with that tinge of uncertainty and curiosity, and makes it a delight to follow her in one heck of an adventure filled with comedy, danger, and spectacular computer generated graphics.<br/><br/>Purist shouldn't go up in arms that the film didn't stick to their beloved tale, as it had enough Easter eggs and references contained within that will please the fans when they spot them. This one in my opinion had more bite, and fit quite well as a compendium of sorts to the established classics, showing that Burton has the insane gall to add his own Midas touch to entertain the masses, with a quality effort complete with amazingly designed visuals that just might make everyone go pick up the books and give them a read again. Highly recommended!"
"mpeak23","4","8","13","9 April 2010"," The Stories don't Match
","Alice in Wonderland is a beloved story that resonates in the mythological realm. I was quite disappointed that this movie was beautiful and well acted, but failed in the mythic story department. It resorted to tired Hollywood formulas that did not match the journey that Alice allegedly makes.<br/><br/>The outer journey that Alice makes starts with a budding rebellion (no stockings) but she still is uncertain and swayed by her mother, sister, and society to perhaps live her life according to outer expectations, instead of from her own heart. When she returns, she is not a tyrant, nor is she a goody-two-shoes, but a mature, courageous young woman ready to go out and live life on her own terms. She obviously had integrated and liberated the parts of herself that were frightened or overly worried about pleasing others with her rebelliousness without being a tyrant about it.<br/><br/>Usually when one has a transformation in a story, the story itself should match the transformation, this one actually contradicts it. In the world she stumbles into, true to formula she finds a quest to liberate the world that is being tyrannized by the Red Queen and restore the bland Goody-Two Shoes White queen to the throne. This isn't what really needs to happen though. To achieve true maturity, as Alice apparently did, one doesn't pit the inner Tyrant against the inner Good Girl, and let one banish the other. Until they are healed, transformed, and allowed to cooperate and collaborate, there is never any lasting peace. What Alice accomplishes on this journey is to have the Tyrant banished where all the disaffected rebels that can't stand the one-dimensional White Queen, will agitate for another rebellion. Stop the War and grow up! Modern psychology has taught us that the Tyrants we need to overcome must to be healed and integrated, not banished to suffer indefinitely. Without the healing process of integration, the contentious relationship between light and dark will always result in conflict, confusion, and violence. The Too Good to be True nice parts also need to be liberated so they don't have to work so hard pleasing everybody. If you were wondering why this story was pretty but vaguely disappointing, here's your answer, it wasn't emotionally true."
"golloglym","3","8","13","22 March 2010"," Bland and a wasted opportunity
","I went to see Alice expecting the perfect mix of one of the most original and surreal directors ever being given the perfect material from arguably the most surreal book in history - a wealth of ideas to interpret and create. Instead this was a hugely disappointing and bland experience that made me feel I wasn't watching work from the same director as Nightmare Before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. The Alice books are dark and the imagery nightmarish. Even an interpretation made for children had the potential for many moments of dark or surreal, outlandish and off-the-wall plots and imagery but the film simply has no heart. There is little plot - characters are left hanging in the air with no development and it just seems to be an Alice 'checklist' - Drink Me, Eat Me, Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter, March Hare, Queens etc. - all present and correct and all on screen for about 30 seconds with no reason why they are there. And the Mat Hatter is perfectly sane! Just with occasional bouts with confusion or self doubt but he soon pulls himself together. But overall the feeling is that there just isn't any direction or reason to have made this - it isn't the original book - that's fine but if you're going to take something that original and make a new vision then that vision had better be something special - and it just seems to be following the same generic formula of any other action Hollywood pic. The 3D as a mechanisms is not so bad but I do wonder when directors are going to realise that rushing 50 things past the screen at once doesn't allow the mind to focus on anything - I had to close my eyes for a few seconds a few times in the film (most notably when falling down the hole) because everything was just a blur - I had no time to follow anything so I waited until the whirlwind of CGI stopped - I had to do something similar with the first Transformers when you couldn't make out any single activity. Overall though really disappointing. My wife and I have long held that the perfect creative team would be Tim Burton directing, Johnny Depp as lead, a plot by Neil Gaman and music by The Cure - the four most original artists in their fields. Pleeeeaaasee Tim don't spend the last third of your career making rehashes."
"SilensMortea","3","26","54","4 March 2010"," All flash and no fire
","I am a big fan of the Alice in Wonderland franchise. I love the books, the cartoon, the imagery, the toys- basically everything Alice. I went to see this movie with really high hopes. I had heard they were making the story a bit different, so I was very hyped up. Unfortunately this movie was awful. Not as bad as others I've seen but definitely not worth waiting for.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was as great as he always seems to be, as was Helena Bonham Carter. Alice was very wooden and looked extremely bored. There was no feeling in the movie whatsoever. Anne Hathaway...What can I say about her? Her character was alright, but her face and makeup were so hideous, she was a freak amongst freaks. She is what partially ruined this movie for me. I couldn't stand her movements and especially her makeup. <br/><br/>The visuals were lovely and dark, very typical Tim Burton, but soon they became very overwhelming and just distracting. Too much CGI. I also found it hard to hear and understand what people were saying. Another sore point I have is how everyone has a different name. I mean Wonderland isn't even Wonderland- it's Underland. Alice doesn't remember being there, but why? No explanation is given. I mean, in Return to Oz Dorothy was given electric shock therapy, you know? Everyone seemed very one-dimensional and boring.<br/><br/>One thing I did like, however, was how some parts of it flashed back to the cartoon Alice that most of us are familiar with. It was great seeing things ""live"" that before had only been seen in a cartoon. Alice also sounds remarkably like the Alice from the cartoon as well. The Queen of Hearts is an amusing character, and I ended up really liking her, although the way she says ""Off with her head"" is distinctly different and I didn't like it. This movie has you flashing to the cartoon but then changing key aspects. <br/><br/>All in all, I'd say this is more of a rental movie, or dollar movie. Going to see it full price is sorely advised against. While you're waiting for the movie to start and actually grab you, you find the credits are rolling and it's already over- then you're left wondering,""What just happened? did I like it?"" And the answer to that is a resounding ""No""."

","I am not going to lash this rather poor movie with references to the books or Disney cartoon (although I did see it first time around in 1951 and was enchanted!), and just treat it as another movie from Hollywood. Why or why is everything now so derivative of what has gone before? Is it that filmmakers think young audiences must have familiarity with something before they will begin the lazy process of watching a fantasy film? This film is dark and poor - just like 'Batman' in the noughties, and just as awful. 'Narnia' springs to mind with Alice in silver armour and carrying Excalibur or whatever, 'Avatar' when the creatures chase Alice, cue big dumb giant sabre toothed tiger running through the grassland'jungle and swooping birds/dragons up and down (did Tim Burton use the same software for his CGI because it is becoming an awful pain to watch?), 'Titanic' with the heroine at the bowsprit, 'Lord of the Rings' with the battle between good and evil amidst a blasted landscape, and the usual 'spot the English thesp' voice amongst the support cast. Oh dear, one could go on, but why? The dreary experience in the cinema took too much out of my life! The script is poor, the imagination very thin, and lots of money has been wasted. Dear, oh dear!"

","I usually enjoy Tim Burton and was absolutely shocked at how bad this adaptation of Alice in Wonderland was. Although it had its moments, it was bogged down by a ridiculous ""sword and sorcery"" type plot, unintelligible dialogue, and dreary visuals.<br/><br/>What was missing? Charm. And a playful whimsical quality that should be present in an Alice in Wonderland story. I wasn't drawn into the ""Wonderland"" world whatsoever. The ""Harry Potter"" type story was incongruent and turned Alice in Wonderland into Harry Potter having a bad acid trip.<br/><br/>Worse, the CGI seemed cheap and the landscapes had no scope nor gave us awe-inspiring wonder. The Red Queen's castle was neat to look at, as were a few other things, but mostly, this was a wasted opportunity visually.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the film was way too adult for the subject matter.

","Like many in my generation, I first came across Tim Burton after seeing his 1989 version of Batman. That was the highest grossing film of the year and it was the most profitable Batman movie until 2008's The Dark Knight. But the success was not just monetary. It was also a critical darling. What could we not love about it? a dark and gritty story, Jack Nicholson playing a mad man with a purple suit, Robert Wuhl as an ace reporter and a magnificent (If not exaggerated) Danny Elfman score.<br/><br/>Batman made Tim Burton a star director and it gave him power that he probably never imagined having. But the man could not handle so much power. Perhaps no other director is as polarizing as the creator of Edward Scissorhands (A darn good film). He commands the loyalty of legions of mall goths the world over but at the same time causes the irritation of pretty much anyone else.<br/><br/>I wont go as far as to call him a bad director but the movies he's had the most control over seem to be his worst. The Tim Burton style that was so well done in 1990 has run it's course in 2010.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie with very low expectations and while it was not an offensively bad movie, it was still a very tedious hour and 40 minutes. Everything that is wrong with a Burton film was back with a vengeance in ""Alice in Wonderland"". A very bad case of style over substance. And not very good style to boast.<br/><br/>The one thing I was looking forward to was Danny Elfman's score. If Hans Zimmer could make ""Pearl Harbor"" enjoyable then surely Elfman could do the same for ""Alice"" right? answer is no. Even the score was amazingly sub-par.<br/><br/>Seems like even Disney knew they had a stinker if they decided to release the movie on DVD after only 3 months. But don't get confused, not all is lost with this film. It has some very nice make-up, wardrobe, facial expressions, voice acting and visuals.<br/><br/>Everything else? just plain tedious. Oh and the 3D? non-factor. I recommend you buy and read a nice book instead of seeing this movie. Don't even rent it, wait until it's on HBO or network television. You'll thank me later.<br/><br/>I'm sure there's a market for this kind of junk but I am also pretty sure they are the Hot Topic crowd."

","It was to hope a total reinvention of Wonderland, with the twist that Burton gives to his films, but sadly, this version on LSD of ""Alice in Wonderland"" is not much than that, because where previous Burton films shined, this one failed. There's not a chance in getting involved with the characters (as we did with both sweet Eddies - Scissorhands and Wood -), and the adventure they are living is as plain as a 32' LED TV.<br/><br/>Alice's journey starts at the common place of social inadequacy and keeps the track of the character that finds itself in the way of its own faith and finally accepts it. Nothing new.<br/><br/>But here comes the new stuff. For the first time Burton directs a story with a female main character. Due to his possible inability to make it strong and interesting enough, Alice is a poor character and it throws away the good chance of taking advantage of Mia Wasikowska's talent. The responsibility of keeping the attention of the public falls again on the capable hands of Johnny Depp, that this time, couldn't make The Hatter character enjoyable. But actually, with that twisted concept of it (those hideous eyes, the hair and the hysteric personality) no actor can make it enjoyable.<br/><br/>It's a shame that all the commotion that the movie has caused is finally translated into an eternally boring movie experience that could have been resumed in over 40 minutes."

","Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a film that I really just don't like, at all. Alice in Wonderland is just an obvious sign of Tim Burton just going straight downhill and hitting rock bottom. This movie just doesn't care about any of the characters or the conflict that it just leaves you with a bad taste by the end. As good and whimsical as the 1951 Disney version is, Burton's version does not even try to enchant you it more just tries to make you love the movie for the visuals.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland is a movie that just doesn't care and is just a bad movie.The story tries, but fails. 19-year-old Alice returns to the magical world of wonderland, where she reunites with her old friends and learns that she has to end the Red Queen's reign of terror. This movie does not even try to relate the show back to the original movie or book. Was there even a Red Queen in the original story? You mean the queen of hearts? <br/><br/>The good in Alice in Wonderland is there, but far between. Nice visuals, but that should be a given for this movie. Johnny Depp is good as the Mad Hatter even though he is not memorable at all. Actually, that is all of the good I can think of, that is sad that there are so few good things in this movie. <br/><br/>There are a TON of terrible things in this movie. The story is just awful, I mean terrible. It just is obviously there to push along the effects. The acting from out main, Mia Wasikowska, is pretty bad and she basically sleepwalked throughout the whole thing. I have seen her in good things like Lawless but she really can't act here. Also, many of the main characters we are supposed to like are just not likable. Both the Dormouse and Tweedledee / Tweedledum are just characters I ended up despising by the end. Tweedledee and Tweedledum are almost Skids and Mudflap bad, yeah that's right I said it. <br/><br/>Overall, Alice in Wonderland is just a film I really did not care for. This film doesn't even try to entertain and comes of more as Transformers for Twilight fans. I can honestly say Alice in Wonderland is the worst adaptation of this classic book and one of Burton's worst films. Next, Tim Burton decides to reinvent one of his favorite T.V. shows, and fails badly."

","""Alice in Wonderland"" was solid, well put together and well acted.<br/><br/>The story takes an unsure 19 year old woman who after a fanciful journey learns to take control of her own life and to stand up for what she believes in during a period when women didn't have control. Each battle she overcomes in Wonderland is one she had within herself.I think a lot of people are missing that, which makes no sense to me since this story has been told 100's of time over the past century.As Alice goes through Wonderland Tim makes sure that all the key points from both of Lewis Carroll's books are in place. He introduces the characters to Alice who is clearly on a return visit.The colorful array of characters go from the Mad Hatter and the March hare to the Caterpillar and Cheshire cat. All the familiars as well as some of the lesser known characters of the White Queen and the Jabborwocki. I was so afraid that Alice In Wonderland would only be about the Mad Hatter, just because of the Depp Factor, but fortunately Tim remembered the movie was about Alice and her coming of age story.Johnny Depp does exceedingly well in this role compared to the gay pirate routine or the border line pedophile Willy Wonka. The Mad Hatter has depth despite his madness. Anne Hathaway does a brilliant job as the air headed white queen.. a relief from the 1985 mini series depiction of the same character. The Tweedles are awesome' and the Cheshire cat you want to take home with you.Tim's Wife even outdoes herself as the Red Queen. Delightful. Visually is everything you ever wanted Wonderland to be. I do believe that Tim Burton has not used castles in his films since Faerie Tale Theatre's Aladdin.Both Castles are directly from your imagination. Anything and Everything you could want out of an Alice in wonderland movie is here and present. As far as the 3D went, kinda expensive, not a necessity for enjoyment but definitely icing on the cake. Leaving the theater I felt like it was money worth spent."

","The key is at the end when Alice returns to the real world and sails off to the Far East. It is a option which would have been unthinkable to women of her station in the 19th century. But Burton evidently wanted a ""modern"" ending, where women have choices which were not available two centuries ago.<br/><br/>Equally scriptwriter, Linda Woolverton, has invented a storyline not present in the books. The film has elements of a medieval epic and a morality play. There is a long journey, knights in armour, battles. Right and wrong are clearly defined. Destiny is pitted against free will: scrolls are brought out to demonstrate Alice's vocation to kill the Jabberwocky. Although she doesn't agree, she nevertheless ends up in a suit of armour – a cross between Joan of Arc and St George – killing the dragon, in a fight scene evidently designed to appeal to the boys in the audience.<br/><br/>Even so, overall, I loved it.<br/><br/>Lewis Carroll was part of my childhood. As a teenager I discovered the ""Hunting of the Snark"" and learned ""Jabberwocky"" by heart, adding portmanteau words to cultural baggage. The Cheshire cat gave me the name for my book ""If You Only Walk Long Enough"". And although the film is not the Alice in Wonderland of the books, I still loved it for the wild colours and exuberant atmosphere.<br/><br/>If the books appeal to children it is because they reflect a child's world. There are many things children must do without understanding why – life simply happens. Children grow taller (Alice grows and shrinks). Words and logic are a source of entertainment and mystery. Everybody seems contrary. Good and evil are only sketchily defined.<br/><br/>In the film – which is based on Carroll's whole oeuvre, not just ""Wonderland"" – Alice still finds a bottles labelled ""Drink Me"" to make her smaller, and cake which makes her grow again. The Mad Hatter still has tea parties, the Red Queen still says ""Off with his head"" at every opportunity, plays croquet using a flamingo as a mallet and a hedgehog as the ball, and is generally a dangerous person to know.<br/><br/>On the other hand, all the King's horses and all the King's men were evidently unable to put Humpty Dumpty together again for the film. And Alice is now 19-years-old and destined to marry a man who is evidently no match for her tomboyish nature. At a critical moment she is saved by the March Hare and the Caterpillar.<br/><br/>The film is not the books, although there are many scenes taken from them and, visually, the CGI borrows intelligently on Tenneil's 19th century artwork. But it is an original work of art.<br/><br/>What did other spectators think of it? ""There was a general clapping of hands""."
"carlypi","9","11","20","11 March 2010"," I don't usually like Tim Burton movies, but.....
","I will start off by saying that I am not a huge fan of Tim Burton. I usually find his movies a bit strange but if there is one place you can be strange and fit right in, it's Wonderland.<br/><br/>I am probably one of the few people who did not see this movie in 3D, but even in 2D it was visually stunning. Wonderland and all it's inhabitants look just as you would imagine, complete with giant toadstools, a blue smoking caterpillar and a Mad Hatter drinking tea.<br/><br/>The story is not a remake of the original but rather a 'what happened next' version based around a more grown up 19 year old Alice and this is what made the movie so enjoyable for me. It was great to see the characters that we all love so much having a new adventure.<br/><br/>I thought that Johnny Depp might over-egg his part as the Mad Hatter and he would be a bit too much like Willy Wonka in the Chocolate Factory again, but his character was actually really likable and understated. Mia Wasikowska made a very sweet Alice, Helena Bonham Carter hilarious as the Red Queen and Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat really stole the show.<br/><br/>I agree with other reviewers when they say the storyline of the movie isn't edge of your seat stuff, but for me it didn't need to be. I was happy to sit back, watch the story unfold and enjoy the silliness."

","I have been enchanted with the story of Alice in Wonderland my whole life. I read it for the first time as a child of 11 and was immediately under its spell; I read it twice more as an adult and it lost nothing of its charm. <br/><br/>I was ecstatic over the prospect of a big budget new adaptation of this classic.<br/><br/>When a friend of mine who had viewed it before me mentioned that a 19-year-old Alice escapes down a rabbit hole to run away from an undesired betrothal, my reaction was ""Huh? I don't remember that from the book."" <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I went to see the movie with a sense of excited anticipation. <br/><br/>Less than half hour into the movie my excited anticipation was dashed upon the rocks. This was NOT the Alice in Wonderland I knew and loved. The phrase ""artistic license"" popped into my head, but even that phrase would not describe the travesty wrought by Tim Burton. <br/><br/>The last time I had such an angry reaction to a movie was when I went to see ""The Last Temptation of Christ."" Both movies took something well-known and loved by many and twisted it into something entirely different and unrecognizable. In the case of Alice in Wonderland, I couldn't help but ask: ""Why even bother calling it Alice in Wonderland?"" Tim Burton simply cannibalized Lewis Carroll's original beloved characters and created his own storyline involving dark conflict and warring factions. (If anything, there were more elements of The Wizard of Oz in this movie than of Lewis Carroll's classic.)<br/><br/>If you're a technophile and are interested in nothing more than special effects (and there must be many of you out there judging by all the hoopla generated by this movie's being in 3D), by all means go see it. But if you, like me, are enamored of the original Alice in Wonderland story as written by Lewis Carroll, do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs. <br/><br/>All in all, as someone who has been so touched by the story of Alice in Wonderland, I found this movie a total abomination. An abomination. Lewis Carroll must be rolling in his grave. <br/><br/>P.S. - If anyone is interested in seeing a truly loving (and accurate) re-telling of this tale, I highly recommend the 1999 TV-movie starring the adorable (and age appropriate) Tina Majorino."

","This movie sucked!! The whole thing really hinges on being 3D and it's not worth it. You sit there and the previews start and it was more fun then the movie. Letters float and I remembered why I wanted to see a 3D movie because I like feeling like I need to move out of the way. But then the movie starts and the film feels like Tim Burton forgot it was 3D until someone said,""Well that was a terrible take just throw something at the audience and they won't notice."" But I did So for those of you who have lived under a rock for the past 20 years you grew up watching the Alice in Wonderland animated movie if you didn't rent it at the local video store get those 3D glasses saved from Avatar and you will really enjoy it or go buy the book and throw it across the room. So you should know the story some girl goes down the rabbit hole then she meets these LSD influenced and you could care less about characters and that's it. But the problem comes when we all know the story! Yes it has the Hookah smoking Caterpillar, it has the Cat, and they seemed to have lost the Mad Hatter under Captain Jack Sparrow with a Scottish Accent. But why should you see this pop up book posing as a movie. You shouldn't haven't you read the beginning but if you wanted to here's the story. Alice is 19 and she is about to get married to a character created by Tim Burton on the set of Corpse Bride. His look and domineer is pulled almost spot on from one of the parents in that movie. Alice then sees the rabbit and fallows it down this hole and you know the rest. But the thing is Alice has been here before and the question is why the hell would you want to come back it's such a stupid story with characters created by Tim Burton with cool looks but look like they stepped out of some acid trip you had after reading the book. But they act more like characters for a radio drama. Every actor is flat, boring and almost regretting signing onto this movie and after they read the script and saw how terrible it was they put it into their performance. Maybe because I'm not 13 and think Nightmare Before Christmas was the greatest movie ever (and hint, hint Tim Burton did not Direct that TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MOVIE SO QUIT PRASING HIM FOR IT!!!) but Tim Burton acts like a film director but wants to be Robert Smith of The Cure he has the look down all he needs is to die and may be reincarnated as Robert Smith. The whole thing felt like it was half assed the only thing I felt looked good where some of the sets but the CGI was so bad it wasn't believable you could see that people didn't look the same because they where Green Screened in and it looks like it was cut and pasted from some picture you saw on the internet. So far 3D movies haven't sold me the whole thing felt like the main idea was the 3D the acting and the story and even the CGI which should be the most important if you want to put us in a real place. But it all feel behind because the 3D is what mattered most. And it only really hit me it was 3D after the fact someone through something at the screen. Overall it wasn't worth the $10 I spent. I could have spent that on the book then imagined the rest or I could have bought some LSD and had a better time sitting in my room listening to Led Zeppelin I could have done a whole lot more things with that $10. Maybe I should have paid someone to shoot me in the foot sure it would have hurt. But it would be worth it then having to see this boring plain and completely stupidly retarded movie. Freddy Got Fingered had my attention more than this."

No-one else could possibly have been cast as the Mad Hatter other than Johnny Depp and it was absolutely fantastic to see so many British actors and actresses cast alongside some of Hollywood's greats. Most notably Matt Lucas as Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dee was inspired!<br/><br/>As it is rated a PG I wouldn't recommend taking children younger than 8 anyway, it can be scary in places and unfortunately some people had taken younger children who ended up a little upset.....<br/><br/>Very much a movie to be viewed on the ""big screen"" so don't delay and see it next Friday when it goes on public release."

","Alice in Wonderland is another big budget exercise in eccentricity for eccentricity's sake from the team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, an overindulgent and unnecessary retelling of the Lewis Carroll tale full of the director's trademark Gothic grandeur and featuring another kooky performance from the top billed star designed to further his appeal with disaffected loners and weirdos (don't be offended: I include myself in those categories).<br/><br/>Help is also on hand from pretty but wooden Mia Wasikowska as Alice, assorted well regarded thesps, a handful of cult names from the world of British TV, and of course, Burton's wife, Helena Bonham-Carter, whose weak impression of Queenie from Black Adder II is sadly the best performance of the whole film.<br/><br/>The clumsy narrative, which focuses heavily on elements from the nonsense poem The Jabberwocky, rarely engages the viewer in a satisfactory manner, achieving neither suspense, tension, excitement or, perhaps most notably, a sense of wonder; instead, the story plays second fiddle to the polished CGI visuals, which offer up the usual, tired, trippy imagery associated with the stories, but fail to either add anything new or make full use of the 3D technology (Wonderland looks positively flat in comparison to Cameron's alien world in Avatar).<br/><br/>Not quite as bad as Burton's re-imagining of Planet of the Apes (thank heavens), but still a long way from the genius on display in Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks (hey, I like it, so there!), Alice in Wonderland must have looked like the perfect project for all involved but the finished product is unlikely to have anyone grinning like the Cheshire cat.<br/><br/>Oh, and anyone who that thinks Crispin Glover needs digitally altering to look creepy is seriously misguided."
"diac228","5","14","28","5 March 2010"," The characters in the movie were right, this isn't the real Alice..
","Whenever there is a dark or whimsical movie script floating around Hollywood, you know that Tim Burton is close behind. Then we have Disney tapping into the Hot Topic-like culture that hit full blast with Nightmare Before Christmas. Place the two together and we have a high-budget version of Alice in Wonderland, one of the most whimsical yet essentially pointless pieces of literature this side of Shakespeare. While Disney has dabbed with the story before back in 1951, it was met with massive criticism from major fans of the book. Nonetheless (and rather ironically) that version is not only the best one, but is easily the most well-known. To add some oomph to the accomplishment, there are at least 15 versions of the book that had been released at one point or another.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the biggest issue of the 2010 Alice in Wonderland: it has some major shoes to fill. If imitating Walt Disney's majesty with animation back in the day was so easy, we would have much heavier competition against Pixar. The 1951 version may not be 100% accurate, but it has a lot of classic scenes, a lot of classic characters, and has the crazy random tone of the book. Tim Burton, using a script that mixes both Alice books and provides us with a version that has a bit more adventure, a bit more peril, but at the same time makes little references to Disney's previous version.<br/><br/>Sadly though, it doesn't have the whimsical majestical tone and mood of the book. While the special effects were nice, the acting was good and the music was Danny Elfmanny, this Alice is a pretty picture painted on an empty canvas. The movie won't test your imagination, it doesn't really provide as much laughter and insanity as it should, and towards the end it becomes a retread of nearly every single fantasy flick within the last decade. Why there is a battle that resembles that of Narnia, I'll never know. This isn't the Alice we know. It may look like Alice, it may behave like Alice, but it still just isn't Alice. It is more accurate in content than the other Alices, but it isn't more accurate in tone.<br/><br/>We know the tale, and this movie takes most of the events from the two books and mixes them together into one grand adventure. However the events happening before entering the rabbit hole is much more extensive than usual. We see Alice (Mia Wasikowska) pretty much getting forced to be married when clearly she isn't ready. Upon running away at the altar, she follows the white rabbit and we all know where it goes from there. A major plot difference though is that the characters in Wonderland constantly believe that she isn't the real Alice for one reason or another. Along the way she meets up with talking flowers, a smoking caterpillar (Alan Rickman), a mean queen (Helena Bonham Carter), the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) among others.<br/><br/>Let's at least praise a few things before thrashing the movie into disappointment level. The acting is superb, especially that of Anne Hathaway believe it or not. Johnny Depp is always deep into the role he plays, but unlike other works (Edward Scissorhands, Pirates of the Caribbean, Ed Wood) he isn't given much material to work with. Helena Bonham Carter is a hoot as the Red Queen. As for our Alice, Mia Wasikowska looks the part and plays the part well. The special effects, while they surprisingly weren't utilized that much for setting, definitely enhanced the visual experience. The Cheshire cat is one example of an improvement over the 1951 version.<br/><br/>And now, the criticism. Alice in Wonderland starts off decently, but once she enters the world of Wonderland, its one that isn't full of curious characters and circumstances, but instead is a dangerous world that throws Alice into a quest. Alice in Wonderland was never intent on being a quest, it was a trip through a totally different environment. In the 1951 version, Alice never had a goal in mind, she spent the entire movie dwelling deeper and deeper into an insane world. In here, we see Alice having to fulfill some sort of destiny for reasons not totally explained. The Mad Hatter isn't as mad as in the book (Or..well, you know by now). The Red Queen isn't as cynical or stupidly cruel asthe other installment.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the movie just doesn't have the trippy look or feel as the book portrayed. Tim Burton is a one-trick visual pony: he rarely ever dwells away from dark and gloomy atmospheres. Instead of looking more like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it resembled that of Sleepy Hollow. Then we have the third act, which mimics that of Narnia, Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings, and the other fantasy flicks that propels the viewer into one final battle. Like previously stated, Alice in Wonderland isn't a tale about a quest, it's a trippy tale about a trippy trip into a trippy place.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The actors were good, the special effects were good, the music was good, but this version of the literary classic just doesn't feel like it should. The movie paces like a fantasy epic, when it should dwell far from it. Part of the charm of the book (and the 1951 version, which by now you should realize I find superior) is that it was so unique, so different, and so defiant of the normality in literature, entertainment, and storytelling. This Alice feels like another movie we've seen before, and with that statement alone, it fails as a remake, retread, or re-telling of the book. Sorry but I won't follow the white rabbit into this rabbit hole again."
"pyrocitor","5","8","14","25 March 2010"," Soulless, by the numbers and drained of redeeming strangeness – hardly a 'wonderland'
","If ever there was a match seemingly tailor made in cinematic heaven, the fusion of Lewis Carroll's cheerfully strange children's fable Alice in Wonderland and Tim Burton, celebrated for his equally bizarre and beautifully grotesque cinematic aesthetics would seem to be it. And yet. For so definitive a pairing, the viewer is never left without a sense of want for more - an elusive sense of lacking throughout. And then the reality of the experience ultimately settles in, yielding a bounty of profound disappointment - Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a project so handpicked for success that it could never have emerged as anything but what it is: the latest in a slew of films geared for great promise, yet ultimately saddled with being a fundamentally soulless, functionable yet frustratingly by-the-numbers piece of mainstream entertainment. <br/><br/>For all the talk of the project being darker, quirkier and edgier than past incarnations of Carroll's cherished tale, it is a remarkable experience to see dark, quirky and edgy be distilled into such an innocuous, harmless slab of comfortable, conventional film-making. There is a perpetual sense of narrative boxes being ticked: the stifling, claustrophobic aristocratic home life in Alice's 'real world', the array of visual trickery, jaw dropping sets and colourful, memorable characters, all introduced in turn for the sake allowing them all their moment, the necessary exposition for the sake of elucidating viewers unaccustomed to Carroll's world, the reveal of the hero's perilous quest and her requisite struggle with acceptance and 'coming of age'. It feels unsettling to see Burton, a filmmaker previously associated with jolting or at least tweaking expectations, delivering plot point after plot point in so cozy, docile and gormless a fashion, as if delivering the familiar formula with additional pablum rather than shaking it up. <br/><br/>This is not to say that Alice in Wonderland is a downright poor film - the standard of quality elements on display remains impressive throughout. It is simply the perpetual sense of the film as such an obvious construction, as if slapped together in a factory from a mould designed for maximum comfortable entertainment, which undercuts all its more laudable elements. Gutted is Carroll's penchant for clever wordplay, subversive mind games or surrealist touches, in favour of a tame adventure/redemption story, with even the stranger characters and settings seemingly inserted for the sake of crafting the illusion of innovation. Equally, the constant references to Alice's previous trip to Wonderland, rather than providing an insightful rumination on the echoing of cultural narratives, instead feel muddled and unwieldly, culminating in a clumsy parable attempting to outline the inevitability of one's actions while also championing (implicitly impossible) individual empowerment, making for an unbalanced thematic centre.<br/><br/>Even Burton's Wonderland, while providing an enjoyable mess of colour and twisted forms, evoking dregs of fascination (the castle moat requiring passage over decapitated human heads is a nicely grotesque touch, albeit one out of place in the overall kid-friendly veneer), feels a tiresomely constructed affair, as if cobbled together by a novice attempting to 'do' Burton rather than the legendary director himself. Even the much heralded 3D effects, while fun, do little to add to any immersive sense of environment or fantasy awe. And Danny Elfman's score leaves one wondering if any traces of his previous flair for enthusiastic, memorable themes remains intact, as his latest work only serves to hammer out banal musical cliché after cliché, further accentuating the overall bland and innocuous feel. <br/><br/>Similarly, the cast run the risk of coasting by on their ideal casting rather than mustering up enough motivation to truly sell their performances. As Alice, Mia Wasikowska encapsulates the overall feel through her performance: serviceably charismatic, balancing moments of wide-eyed innocence with hard worn maturity, yet tiresomely bland and lacking any real spark. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter delivers yet another cheerfully deranged loon, but the novelty of his eccentricities wears perilously thin, making his bulging green eyes and garrulously fluctuating accents still lack the necessary punch to distinguish his Hatter from past oddball creations. Likewise is Helena Bonham Carter's petulant Red Queen, coasting on apparent autopilot and lacking the vindictive leering to make her ""Off with their heads!"" really hit home. Anne Hathaway emerges in a more favourable light as the White Queen, subversively twisting the ethereal, gossamer royalty clichés with an undercurrent of irritable edge, and offering one of the film's few traces of subtlety. Such is a quality sorely lacking in the awkwardly stretched Crispin Glover's Red Knave, one of the most harmless 'creepy evil' characters in years, and Matt Lucas' comic relief twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum, whose banter is so boring and banal one is left debating the purpose of their inclusion at all. The celebrity-voiced animals prove more endearing, particularly Stephen Fry's sumptuously oily and sanguine Cheshire Cat and Alan Rickman's gleefully grumpy Caterpillar, but one is left lamenting the peerless Christopher Lee's booming tones as the ferocious Jabberwocky being reduced to a single line, as shameless a piece of stunt casting as his pointless appearance in 2007's The Golden Compass. It is telling that the most enjoyable and fully realized character is the deranged March Hare, a consistent background player, who, through continually throwing crockery around and unhinged cackling, injects the film with crucially lacking dashes of spontaneity and energy. <br/><br/>There is undeniable entertainment to be found in Burton's Wonderland: exciting battles, strangely stylized sets and quirky characters. But it is the near flaunted sense of artificiality, of the consciously constructed package of the affair, which leaves a continual disconnect between the viewer and true engagement or enjoyment. Perhaps the involvement of Disney should have suggested such a docile, friendly take, but for all averse to quality yet blandly assembled fantasy adventure, this is one rabbit hole worth staying out of. <br/><br/>-5.5/10"

","Having read a less than enthusiastic review of the film, I wasn't expecting all that much. Though the reviewer did say that if you were a fan of Tim Burton, you'd be in first line waiting, and I suppose he was right in that.<br/><br/>When I went to buy my ticket, I was given glasses and realised it was in 3D! Didn't know this. Let me get this straight right now, if I had seen this before Avatar, I'd have wowed, but seeing it after, it made me realise the 3D effects were quite simplistic and I have now realised what a standard Cameron actually set. The film has obviously a budget much less than Avatar had, and a lot of corners have had to be cut. The 3D is indeed much less tooled, and, while it was nice (I think 3D particularly suits fantasy), it is not essential to see it this way, and 2D would serve the film quite well too. Let's get the bad bits over first: The CGI characters were cheap looking and some of them downright bad (Bayard, the horses); the CGI budget was blown on the Jabberwocky, who does deliver, in passing.<br/><br/>Burton obviously did not want to make another remake of Alice, so he got the idea to make her go back to Wonderland as an 18 year old; the side-effects of this is that it really feels like a sequel - Alice, the Return - and we know how much worse sequels are from the word go, probably because a story ought to finish with ""and they lived happily ever after"" and disturbing the dust afterwards feels contrived. So that when Alice arrives in Wonderland, we are subjected to a too long and tedious rehash and representation of all the characters. Burton might have been better off just doing something more different, rather than having to resume the first story in the first half of the film, which takes a while then to take off properly.<br/><br/>Alice is then 18, her father has died, and she is a wilfully delightful original girl, who daydreams all the time. She is invited to a grand ball, where her suitor, a young noble with digestive troubles, proposes to her. But Alice has seen the rabbit in the garden and flees to follow him, and go back to Wonderland, of which she has all forgotten about. In Wonderland, the red queen has overthrown the white queen and rules over beasts and men in a desolate kingdom. Alice is the promised one who can defeat the jabberwocky, dragony type monster who helped the red queen take over. She meets all her old friends and reluctantly embarks on this quest.<br/><br/>Once we've been reintroduced to all the characters, the story finally takes off. Helena Bonham Carter is a villain in the class of Basil Rathbone, Johnny Depp slowly takes over the whole show and Alice herself is an absolute joy. Stephen Fry as the Cheshire cat is simply brilliant. The other characters are somewhat blander, and some of them totally forgettable. (Alan Rickman as the caterpillar is of course fantastic, but he only appears to deliver bits of wisdom here and there and is not made the most of) My feeling throughout the whole thing was that Tim Burton couldn't make up his mind if he wanted a child's film or an adult film, and it veers from one to the other constantly, without much consistence. This is a shame. Disney produced the film, and it does feel as if Terry Gilliam had been taken over by Walt in a weird satanic internal struggle. Indeed there is a smattering of Python humour as well, and the crowd laughed a few times out loud. Once I laughed out loud myself, and I can't remember when that happened last in a cinema. 2/3rd of the way, I finally was totally engrossed in the story, Johnny Depp was growing exponentially in his role (even though his Scottish accent is shaky in places and even though it isn't all that different from Jack Sparrow to start with), and it ended in a total success (The epilogue might not have been entirely necessary - but Disneys and children and Hollywood must).<br/><br/>The general atmosphere of Wonderland was quite to very good, even with the budget obvious CGI limitations and it definitely had a Gilliam feel to it (well, it's Burton, isn't it), that fantasy tang, that I always failed to see in LOTR the movie* (which does look like random leather-clad dudes and trees walking across New-Zealand, let's face it. Actually, except that scene with Arwen at Aragorn's grave). It's probably the same bluey filter they use in the Guinness ads, and I love the feel of it. I thought the final confrontation was great. I wonder is Weta involved, or is John Howe involved, because it did remind me of Finarfin vs Morgoth (or St George vs. the dragon) *the white queen's castle is very reminiscent of Rivendell I must say.<br/><br/>So, for all its faults, I did enjoy the film very much and would go again, if only for Johnny Depp, who is disturbingly and magnetically attractive, even as a deformed fool."

","I have now seen this movie 3 times in theaters and I like it more each time. I very rarely like movies made outside of the 80s and I wasn't expecting much from Tim Burton after Planet of the Apes and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I was very surprised at how much I loved Alice in Wonderland. I am a huge fan of the stories of Alice. From the book to the animated movie to the 1985 version. They're all special in their own way just like Tim Burton's version. I never thought that there would be an Alice in Wonderland as good as the animated version but with each viewing, I'm starting to get torn between which I like more and I love the animated version.<br/><br/>I'm really surprised to see so many negative reviews for this movie. I thought both the acting and the story were top notch. The special effects were amazing. I could care less about the 3D which was great. However I enjoyed the movie more without it just like I did with Avatar. I see both movies compared a lot and Avatar always being considered the better movie. I don't agree with this at all. I loved Avatar but it had its downfalls. It's too long, too slow paced, very repetitive. I'm not reviewing Avatar here but that's my opinion of it. Just like my opinion of Alice in Wonderland being almost perfect.<br/><br/>I wish that some characters were shown more. Definitely the March Hare who is now one of my favorite movie characters of all time. The Mad Hatter's dance still seems a little out of place for me. These are the only faults I could find and they're very minor. If you haven't seen Alice in Wonderland yet then do so right away. I would compare it most to Stardust and Willow and slightly to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. 10 out of 10 for me and I would only consider a dozen movies to be that good."

"east-emerald","9","10","19","7 March 2010"," Alice gets her groove back
","I am going to start off with a bit about my movie experience before moving on to ""Alice In Wonderland"". I knew I was seeing a PG movie but was dismayed by the number of Cartoon Network commercials I was seeing in the 20 minute land of the lost before the movie starts. The low point was a Pinocchio rip-off called Veggie Tales : Pistachio (ugh!). I reminded myself that this was a Tim Burton movie; so that had to count for something.<br/><br/>The Set Up : I am not as familiar with the original Alice stories as I may have once been but it appears Tim Burton has went with a mix of elements from the original Alice, Through the Looking Glass and Carroll's wonderfully senseless poem Jaberwocky (all sprinkled lightly with some Chronicles of Narnia action). We first see Alice as a young girl asking her father if she is bonkers because she has been dreaming about falling down a rabbit hole and talking animals. He reassures her with a famous line about all the best people being bonkers. We find Alice next as a 19 year old girl with a dour mother ( Dad has died), and she is being dragged to a afternoon party where there is a trap of sorts. She will be proposed too by a pretentious dorky sort from the upper-class who cautions Alice ""when in doubt, be quiet"". This is all of the classic recipe for the female empowerment story that will take place when Alice runs away and falls down the rabbit hole ( is it just me or can you not read that phrase without thinking about drugs?).<br/><br/>The Good: Once in Wonderland we are met with all of the characters that have become part of our cultural landscape. When first seeing trailers, I was worried the movie was too much about Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter but it isn't so. Everybody in Wonderland gets there screen time and uses it well. Tweedledee and Tweedledum are at times laugh out loud funny, the Blue Caterpillar is wise ( and yes he smokes a hookah but we're not told what's in it??), and the Cheshire cat is clever in spades. I have read that the Helen Bonham Carter steals the show as the Red Queen and I agree. She is a storm of what we might term passive aggressive behavior with plenty of ""off with their heads"" I'm glad Depp has a more scaled back performance that may have been expected. My opinion is that this was on purpose because there were a lot of people left with a queasy feeling over the wild eyed androgynous Willy Wonka . It is through Depp though that Burton most delivers his dark take on Alice. The Mad Hatter's madness is one rooted in sadness and a manic desperation due to his beautiful world being warped by the Red Queen.<br/><br/>The Bad: I don't know if the blame belongs with Tim Burton or Disney but outside of Wonderland the story does seem trite. The ending especially seems rushed and too typical. Alice quickly deals with all of her non Wonderland problems and even finds prospects of future independence in a career and this is all in the last 5 minutes ( it seemed). Tim Burton has made his mark on the world by letting people who might see the world a bit askew that it's OK and to compromise any of that would not be a good thing."

","I'm an avid fan of the Alice in Wonderland animation by Disney as well as the book by Lewis Carroll. Watching the trailers made me realize it wasn't a remake but a 'return' which had me giddy with joy for a new story.<br/><br/>Even though the Cheshire Cat didn't amuse me as much as in the animation and book, and the dormouse wasn't tired and used a sword like every other mouse in every other movie, this movie was awesome.<br/><br/>Being a Tim Burton film I was shocked how well he kept this movie in the range of children. I sat in the theatre with people of all ages who appeared to enjoy the film. The most mature part of the film would be either the heads in the moat of blood, the eye part with Dormouse, and the fake breasts scene. Very tastefully done Tim! I applaud you for not taking this movie too far away from it's start.<br/><br/>The trailers led me to believe the movie may be too built around the Mad Hatter, advertising Johnny Depp and basically no one else, I was pleasantly surprised when it followed Alice the whole time essentially. I think the actress who portrayed Alice, Mia Wasikowska, was the best cast decision in the whole film. The best Alice I've ever seen cast and one I wish to see again in perhaps a reprisal in another Wonderland tale. I absolutely fell in love with her. I loved how Alice took care of the Jabberwocky, and her line ""Off with your head!"" Epic.<br/><br/>The soundtrack throughout the movie and credits were wonderful, I liked them all.<br/><br/>10/10 Stars from a very satisfied Wonderland fan.<br/><br/>Mia Wasikowska is my new favorite actress because of her performance as Alice.<br/><br/>Edited to add this: Alice is 19 now. My question is why is everyone complaining about her not being the same naive girl she was before? Hard to believe everyone complaining remained as ignorant when they were 19 as when they were 7. I choose not to wear the codfish on my head."

","There's not a lot else to say about this film that hasn't been said, amazing visuals, very poor acting, no depth in the story telling, I found this movie boring, lack lustre, without any kind of good storyline, genetic, no laughs to be had here, I'm racking my brains to find anything to give this movie it's saving grace, and failing.<br/><br/>I will say, I didn't mind the sound track. But the 2 hour+ (including trailers and those pointless, annoying ads we all see on TV any way) run time won't leave your 2 year old in silent awe.<br/><br/>So what do I think should happen now? I feel that Tim at least needs to take a break, I think he needs to come up with something new, original and ground breaking, otherwise he should just leave this (he'll get all the money he'll ever need from this movie plus I'm sure he's got enough already). Do I think Cinemas were right to boycott screen of the movie due to the Blu-ray/DVD month early release? absolutely :(.<br/><br/>Update: I forgot to say that Jonny Depp should have kept a voice, not change it all the time.

","This movie version of ""Alice is Wonderland"" is surprisingly intelligent.<br/><br/>It takes the main elements of the classical story, set 13 years later against the tyrannical rule of Red Queen, thus setting up the archetypal ""quest"" story cleverly incorporating the book's Jabberwocky poem.<br/><br/>Bookending this ""quest"" is the 'real world' story of a Victorian girl coming of age and gaining the courage to take control of her life against social pressures and expectations.<br/><br/>In terms of literary ingenuity I think it's terrific - provided you're familiar with (and a big fan of) the original Alice story."

","I've gotta admit up front that I am not a huge Johnny Depp fan and frankly think I've seen enough of him for some time. Now I am not saying he isn't talented—he certainly is. But so often his films have 'mega-hit' written all over them and the public throngs to his films like lemmings—and I just think I've seen enough. So why did I finally get around to watching ""Alice in Wonderland""? Well, I am currently on a Disney Cruise and the ship is equipped with an amazing 3-D theaterand this film just happened to be playing. And, given that my family is exhausted after a day of exploring Martinique, I thought I'd take in this film. After all, even a bad 3-D film could be a nice diversionespecially when I have to pay nothing extra to see it.<br/><br/>Well, after seeing this film I am a bit stumped. On one hand, I didn't particularly enjoy the film—it has a particularly joyless thing—not at all fun to watch. But on the other, I can't just discount the good things about the film. Despite the plot doing almost nothing for me, I at least enjoyed the following: The 3-D will sneak up on you. Much of the early portion of the film (in the normal world) could have just as easily been done in traditional 2-D, once things got moving in Neverland the 3-D was lovely—and very immersive.<br/><br/>The music was very nice. There must be a law that says that in addition to Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp, Danny Elfman MUST write music for every Tim Burton epic. The music was great and well done.<br/><br/>I enjoyed seeing and hearing some old favorites. The voices of some were recognizable—such as Christopher Lee as the Jaberwock, but Michael Gough (who appeared in lots of old Hammer films and must be 134 years-old) and Stephen Fry provided their voices as well. While Crispen Glover has had a very mercurial career, here he is rather mainstream (like he was in the ""Back to the Future"" films) and it's nice to see him again. Matt Lucas was lovely in a non-""Little Britain"" role as well. Plus who cannot enjoy Alan Rickman's wonderfully disdainful voice?!<br/><br/>Now to provide equal time, here is what I didn't like:<br/><br/>Alice in the real world was one giant anachronism. Women did not act like her.ever. The ending in particular was very politically correct and timelybut not for the mid-19th century. As a result of this and the way her character was generally written, she was really impossible to like or care for in any way—she was simply a caricature. And, speaking of caricatures, what was up with Depp's Mad Hatter?! Break dancing?! Bizarre makeup that looked way too whacked out and bizarre for a Rocky Horror reunion?! Plus, like Alice, he seemed to have nothing in the way of personality—he was just goofy .<br/><br/>As for the story, as I said above, it was joyless. Too dark, too intense, too violent and way too gross---all the fun of the Red Queen from the cartoon was replaced by a homicidal maniac and heads being lopped aplenty. For a kids' film, this was surprisingly gloomy and un-fun. ThereI think I hit on the BIG problem.the movie simply was not fun to watch. Spectacular and cool, but rarely fun."

","If I could give this movie zero stars I would; in fact, I would give it negative stars if that were possible. I say this not as simple hyperbole, but because this movie was really that bad and it is a shame that such a classic story that was brilliantly written could be brought to this low level- cheapened to the point of being worthless. As an adapted screenplay, this movie is an abomination, not only because it barely follows the original story (which is what an adaption is supposed to do), but because it does it in such a ham-fisted manner. <br/><br/>One of my biggest problems with this movie is the fact that it was turned into a vehicle for Johnny Depp. The movie is called Alice in Wonderland, not The Adventures of the Mad Hatter in Wonderland. But of course Depp is the bankable star that is supposed to sell the film, so naturally he has to be in practically every scene; never mind the fact that the Mad Hatter is a rather minor character in the book. Not only is he too present, but then they have to make him absurd in every aspect. The Hatter must be crazy in deed and appearance to such a ridiculous extent that it is painful to watch. The pinnacle of my revulsion came with the moronic dance at the end, made all the worse by the fact that it was CG ""enhanced"". Johnny Depp should try his hand at acting again instead of appearing in Tim Burton's movies as asinine characters who are completely obtuse, one dimensional, and boring. <br/><br/>This of course brings us to the main reason this movie is so horrible: Tim Burton. It has gotten the point now where any movie associated with him is a sure sign of a bad movie. I know that when I see his name attached to a project, red flags immediately go up, but it has gotten so bad now, that I reflexively reject anything he directs or writes and with good reasons. 1) His ""cinematic vision"" is roughly equal to that of Mister Magoo after a night of heavy drinking. It was original when it was Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, but now it is worn out and a clear sign of a hack who is living off his past achievements. As a matter of fact, Mr. Burton, you do not have to make every movie with elements of your bizarro Halloween world included in each scene. A perfect example in Alice in Wonderland is the White Queen, who looks more akin to the Corpse Bride (naturally). 2) Burton's ability to tell a story has been seriously impaired by his reliance on special effects. This movie was one of the worst examples of trying to sell the visuals at the expense of the story. Then again, when you have such a compromised screenplay, maybe the safe fix is to dress it up with neat visuals. It still is very similar to putting lipstick on a pig, in my opinion. 3) Maybe it is time to change up the casting. Every movie the mope makes has Johnny Depp and Helena Bohnam Carter. And while he is at it, he can change the art director, and fire the lighting guy, the editor and the cinematographer too. <br/><br/>This movie is supposed to be about Alice, but almost from the beginning she is getting lost in the shuffle, and the actress they chose for Alice was not a good choice either as she just fades into the background in many scenes and delivers her lines in a perfunctory manner that suggest nothing of a leading role. It is not that you do not care about Alice in particular, it is that you are left not caring about anything in this movie because the story has been so horribly eviscerated to the point of being unrecognizable. The beginning of the movie was mind-numbingly boring, and then when one finally reaches the point where Alice falls down the rabbit hole, and one has the slightest flicker of hope that the movie will somehow recover, those hopes are cruelly dashed by more horrible dialog and slow scenes that are meant to show off the talents of the CG animators rather than tell the story. <br/><br/>I did not want to see this movie, in fact, I was manifestly against seeing this movie from the first moment that I saw the trailer. I saw this movie knowing that is was going to be a train wreck, nevertheless I chose to immolate myself by watching it. After the first thirty minutes I was convinced that this was a mistake and a waste of time, every bit as bad as Sweeney Todd, Willy Wonka, Sleepy Hollow and the steady string of turds that Tim Burton has shat out on the public for the past ten years."

","Since around the 1980s and 1990s, Tim Burton has capture many attention's eyes from the screen to the public eye for his dark work since he created short films like Frankenweenie and Vincent, and for working nearly 7 times with Johnny Depp, it never gets old! But now...Tim Burton takes a new turn on a priceless classic movie everyone knows and love and that's Alice in Wonderland! Lots of people have complain about this being a remake to the 1951 animated classic by the Walt Disney man himself, but no. It's more than different. It's dazzling in it's dark twisted ways! In the 2010 new version, Alice is at an engagement party where a stuck-up snooty man asks her to marry him; Alice isn't too fond by that idea so she tells everyone that she needs a moment by herself and think about it; and where does she go? To find the rabbit hole, only to end up falling to a place called Wonderful! The legendary director mister Tim Burton himself has pick a wonderful cast; and I'm not just talking about Johnny Depp or his girlfriend for 9 years Helena Bonham Carter. There's also Anne Hathaway who came a very long way since her role in The Princess Diaries playing as The White Queen in this film. And newcomer Mia Wasikowska as Alice makes her part in the movie very well done and nicely.<br/><br/>I've heard lots about this news for the movie since one year ago when they show trailers of it and it just blew me away, but when I saw it, I was surprised how differently it turn out to be.<br/><br/>It's a little bit odd than most of Tim Burton's old work before, but you won't stop enjoying it till it's over.

"ironhorse_iv","6","5","8","4 November 2016"," This movie isn't wonderful at all! It's horrible!
","2010's 'Alice in Wonderland' is a film that, on paper, would seem perfect for director Tim Burton's dark creepy unique skills. After all, the original novel of the same name by author, Lewis Carroll is known for its dark humor, and insane tone, but the main reason why I dislike this movie, so much, is because, the screenwriter of this film, Linda Woolverton try to put logic in a story that needs no logic. 'Alice in Wonderland' isn't about an ancient prophecy about a grown woman, Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) ending the Red Queen's reign (Helena Bonham Carter) and restoring order to the world of Underland, with war and battle. No, it's about a child's journey into the world of the absurd and surreal, and learning that life is not rational. Most adaptations follows these guidelines, but somehow director Tim Burton's version, wanted to be different and verve off, drastically. Sadly, the changes, they made, weren't good at all. First off, when did Wonderland turn into Underland? I get, that the land is supposedly beneath a rabbit hole in the ground, but since the movie share more relates to the novel 'Through the Looking-Glass' than 'Alice: Adventures in Wonderland', shouldn't it, be call 'Mirrorland'? Or better yeah, 'Imagineland' since its coming from the dark side of Alice's mind. Anyways, no matter, how much logic, they try to put into naming this place. Carroll never call, his world, anything else, than Wonderland. It's always been Wonderland. So, why did they add this!? It's so pointless. Also, when did that world had a 'Chosen One' war plot as if it's 'Lord of the Ring' or 'Narnia'?! Isn't it weird that nobody else, step up and kill the queen, already, seeing how the land is full of magical cakes and liquor that change your size? Why hasn't that happen, yet!? Even the villain, doesn't match the source material, as the Red Queen is not the same person as the Queen of Hearts. If anything, it's should be a war against math, since Carroll hatred that. Second off, they insult both the fans of the 1951's Disney animated version and the Carroll's purists, by having deceitful marketing. By having a grown adult, Alice returning back to Wonderland, instead of a kid discovery the world for the first time. It made this film, technically a sequel. Yet, Disney still call the movie with its originally name, leading much confusement. Honestly, a story like this, could had work, if they went with a different title and wrote Alice as a adult who must reclaims her youthful spirit in order to save the world. Similar in the way, 1991's film 'Hook' did with its source material with 'Peter Pan'. Instead, the movie has Alice, still childish in her adult years fighting against the pressures of conforming to 19th century aristocratic society's expectations. This is fine and dandy, if the moral of story is trying to tell the audience to be mature adults and learn to take responsibility, but no that's isn't what, the screenwriter was going for. The film instead, has Alice still going against her Victorian lifestyle straight in the end; even after the fact that she obey Wonderland's rules, with her destiny on killing the dragon-like creature, the Jabberwocky (Voiced by Christopher Lee), leading to little to no character development. I know, Woolverton wanted to make Alice into a stronger will person, that empower women to choose her own path, but this story arch goes nowhere. Couldn't they wrote Alice, a little better!? Mia Waskowska's performance doesn't help as well. She seem very disconnected from everything that is happening on screen. She seem so bland and boring. The worst of this, had to be the scenes, where Alice is supposed to go through a variety of absurd physical changes that are to represent the discomfort of having a period and going through puberty. Hints the metaphors with the food and drinks. Yet, Mia's look so disinterested. We see very little traumatic, frustration, or even sadness, from her. Very bad acting. Made me wish, for a talent child actress instead. The only reason, why I can see why they change this, is because of Lewis Carroll's questionable relationship with little girls. A lot of historians think that he might had been a paedophile, but still had Alice be a kid in this film. After all, this is originally supposed to be, a kid's movie. Despite that, the supporting cast were a little more memorable in their performance, even if they were chewing up the scenery with how over the top, they were. Still, it's a bit tiresome and repetitive, to see actors Johnny Depp and actress, Helena Bonham Carter in yet, another Burton movie doing their shtick. Another problem with this film, is how ugly looking the visuals look. I hate how much time, they spent in Alice's Victorian era life. Everything there is so gloomy. It really sucks the fun out of the film. Wonderland in 3D is not any better. Although, the visuals of that world does have some beautiful moment, for the most part, the faded colors added to the melancholy tone of the world at war theme. It's not that good. Plus, it looks so blurry. I'm sorry, but the CGI also looks very fake-looking. They all have that artificial quality that looks even worse in the 2D version of the film. It's sad, because Burton was once-known for his stunning cool sets and unique realistic character design. Another disappointment in this film was lack of music. Where was the 'happy unbirthday' song? Where is any song from the source material!? Clearly, there wasn't much heart, put into that department as even Danny Elfman's overall score sounds pretty generic and plain as well. Despite these qualms, the film made a lot of money, proving once again that Burton knows how to please the majority of his audience. However, not me. I really hate this film and its 2016 sequel. Can't recommended."
"mikes2001","9","5","8","6 August 2010"," More wonderment from Burton & Depp
","Normally I wouldn't add my comments to a film that already has 573 comments as of this writing, but I see that reviewers have only given it a 6.7 rating. Alice In Wonderland is much better than that. A 6.7 is for a movie that had a couple of interesting points but was not expertly executed. Or was expertly executed but didn't have much substance. Alice is neither of those. It is an imaginative film presented magnificently.<br/><br/>To backtrack a little, I didn't think I'd enjoy the prior Burton/Depp hook-up - Charlie and The Chocolate Factory - as much as I did, so I went into Alice In Wonderland with high expectations. That is usually a recipe for disaster as I am then setting myself up for disappointment. But those expectations were satisfied. The characters were rich. The color was richer and the sets were incredible.<br/><br/>I saw this movie at home on DVD, not in 3-D in the theater, and I feel bad that I didn't make the pilgrimage to the theater to see it in its glory, but maybe on the next Depp/Burton collaboration I'll do it. Here in Long Island, 2 3-D tickets would be about $30, and I wasn't sure if Burton/Depp would deliver the goods. They did.<br/><br/>Give it a shot. Sit back and enjoy."

"kushka53KarenPetersen","2","14","30","5 March 2010"," Don't waste your money
","I will quote from a friend before elaborating further, as he sums this up perfectly. ""The verdict on Alice It was okay. I think that it sent a much better message to children (especially young girls) than older Disney movies (if you wish upon a star— basically sit around, hope, and it will happen). Nevertheless, the graphics, which look awesome in the advertisements, just made me want to see Avatar again. And other than the red queen,the acting was bland and the characters didn't really drive the story. Johnny Depp is so interested in characterization he doesn't connect, in a human way, with anyone else. (And what's with those eyes? Yikes!) I felt like Burton just forced a lot of ideas together without making them feel like they grew out of each other. It's not quite as disappointing as the last Indiana Jones, but"" Personally, I don't understand all the critics gushing over this movie. Have they all forgotten what a really good magical movie really looks like? It's basically Disney as usual with a few Burton twists, i.e. the Cheshire cat and the Red Queen's bizarre appearance, and other than that I nearly fell asleep. Given the ability of the actors that were signed, this was a fairly boring film. It tried soooo hard but somehow missed the mark. A little less CG effects and more attempts at film making and it would have been a better movie. After all, The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T managed to be a classic with so very little, as did Freaks--two very different, but equally effective, black and white films. And let's not forget, of course, Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast with the great Jean Marais as the Beast. The scene where he carries in his arms Beauty, who has fainted, down his hallway and the candles held by human arms open out as he walks by is timeless cinema magic. Burton, you wish! Ah, what to do? Burton is everybody's darling these days but I just don't see it. I'd prefer he would do cartoons and animation. That he is brilliant at. But flesh and blood isn't his cup of tea. 2 stars out of 10, in my book. Don't waste your money!"

When we have left ""Avatar"" we spoke about it for an hour, when we have left ""Evan almighty"" we still giggled about the funny scenes. ""Alice in wonderland"" left nothing to be exited about, to laugh about or to think about, so we spoke about music and the upcoming birthday, we have treated the last 108 minutes as if they never happened. Definitely not a good sign. This was a nice looking (and expensive) 3D evening, that gave me and my daughter nothing. No character I could love, no character I could really hate, just a big nothingness. Disappointing."
"JimD73","4","8","15","28 March 2010"," This isn't Alice, this is a fanfic
","First things first, Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a sequel, not a remake. No, its not Through the Looking Glass, its an entirely new sequel with an 18-year old Alice finding her way back to Wonderland (well, Underland, but whatever). Sequel is perhaps not the best word, because really, this is a fanfic with a budget, and as such is plagued with narrative issues. Which might be OK, but its visuals are also somewhat disappointing considering the pedigree, and the 3D effect is eye-straining.<br/><br/>Alice has grown up and assumed her childhood adventures were a figment of her dreams. Then she is distracted by a rabbit with a stopwatch after being proposed to by rich d-bag and falls back down the rabbit hole. Turns out, they need Alice to slay the Red Queen's dragon, the Jabberwock, freeing the people of Underland from her reign of terror. With the assistance of a militant Mad Hatter, a wise smoking caterpillar and a loopy White Queen.<br/><br/>If only Alice could convince herself it wasn't just a dream all over again. Maybe some people have considerably more lucid dreams than I have, however the fact that Alice goes through a solid three-quarters of the movie before finally realizing shes not dreaming. The movie seems to try to treat it the same way, despite it being blatantly obvious Wonderland is a reality. Its enough to make any viewer despise Alice for the entire course of the film.<br/><br/>Not that she's particularly hard to despise, since she's portrayed very flatly. She's not particularly naive or stupid or ditzy, just very flat and boring. In a movie as full of out-there characters as this, it would seem that thats the only way to play it, but it makes it very hard to care for the lead.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, they clearly try to be as out there as possible with scattershot success. The best of the bunch is clearly Helena Bonham Carter as the evil Red Queen, who eats up scenery like a buffet. Even if we hear ""off with her head"" perhaps once too many times, her performance still comes close to saving the movie. Crispin Glover carries a villainous presence as the Knave of Hearts, a captivating role at first though eventually he amounts to nothing. Anne Hathaway also has some entertaining moments as the Gothic White Queen. While her makeup may not be as strange as for the other characters, her performance certainly is.<br/><br/>The problem is too many characters crowd the film. The problem with a fanfic is that certain characters meant for only one or two segments end up with incredibly inflated roles. In the original Alice, the minor characters took over the movie, but had their segments and then got out of the way. The new film tries to keep the cast continually growing, giving these minor one-dimensional characters enough screen time to make us sick of them.<br/><br/>The biggest instance is clearly the Mad Hatter, a character never meant for a role this big. Sure, he was memorable in the old Alice, but it was a concentrated dose. Here, he's given full lease over the movie, and gets flat out annoying. Johnny Depp does not help, as he seems on his own version of auto-pilot, not doing anything with the character we wouldn't expect of Willy Wonka or Jack Sparrow. Its another eccentric role that unfortunately doesn't feel much different than his others, and one of his most underwhelming performances in general.<br/><br/>Can't get by without mentioning the 3D effects. After seeing Final Destination use them as a crutch and Avatar use them beautifully, my feelings were that the 3D can be used for good if the effort is put into it. With Alice, it was obviously a last-minute add-in, because the effect wears on the eyes very quickly. I eventually just started having fun tilting my head side to side and changing the colour tint. Suffice to say the film is probably better in 2D.<br/><br/>The movie has some Gothic themes for sure, which may frighten kids more than the ads imply. For one example, there is a river of human heads. Cue nightmare fuel. The movie wants to seem grown up with these things, clearly thrown in to appease fans of Nightmare Before Christmas, but the plot is unable to keep up. The movie ends in a gigantic battle, just a lazy excuse for the few who wanted to see the Tweedles do battle. Its a lazy ending, thats for sure.<br/><br/>Tim Burton may have seemed like the perfect choice on paper for Alice, but it just didn't work. Most of the blame lands on the lazy fanfic of a script, and the over-reliance of small characters. It has some nice visuals and the Red Queen is certainly entertaining, but all ye stoners would be better off to keep watching the cartoon."

","I was surprised, having read many unflattering reviews at how much I enjoyed the movie. I think it was a fun movie and I laughed quite a lot. It isn't deep, and there are parts I am sure were left on the cutting room floor. The ending in particular seemed to just chop and there were some confusing references which I was sure must refer to some lost bit of the film. The story was good though and not predictable as even some Oscar nominees have been.<br/><br/>Oh yes, I always hoped Burton would make Alice a brunette, but that wasn't this story and if that doesn't suit some, so be it. Perhaps it is a love hate thing which depends on what one expected to see. It was a good way to spend a couple of hours and I was surprised at how fast the movie flew by, where some much lauded movies of late had me aching.<br/><br/>I saw children dancing in the aisles after the movie and there was applause in the theater. It is a great movie for young and the young at heart no matter the age. <br/><br/>Visually stunning and enjoyable on many levels. It is a pleasure to see that movies are, after so long, finally being made that are worth seeing on the big screen."

","You would think it was a perfect recipe, Burton, Depp and Lewis Caroll, yet from the moment very early on in the film when I saw the dreadful acting of the child Alice and her father in a mawkish bedroom scene , surely too badly done even for a school play, I knew this was going to be bad. The movie stuttered badly with poor performances from most of the human players, Depp appeared to be puzzled as to how to play his role as the Mad Hatter, surprising since I for one would have thought this would have been a gift for him, he was at times well frankly boring. Like wise Hathaway who could have been missing from her role and I'm not sure I would have noticed, she really acted VERY badly. Seen by me in 3D this was a wasted opportunity for the film makers to prove the worth of this format, very blah effects all the way thru'. On reflection, I'm now becoming alarmed as the animated characters clearly acted their human counterparts off the screen, what does this say for the future of the Oscars ? Having got used to animated/part animated movies with a kids theme but definitely aimed at the adult market, this is a film aimed at the adult market but really isn't up to viewing by anyone over the age of 8 years. An expensive, wasted opportunity ."

","I saw Alice in wonderland opening night. I am a huge Tim Burton fan I believe this is some of his best work yet. Also johnny depp played a good part i don't think any one else could have pulled off the mad hatter with his personality he did a great job. The girl who played Alice also did a great job all though i wish it would have been different ending it was overall a great movie. I love how Tim Burton put his own twist on this classic Disney movie. Between him being the director and having an all star cast it was an awesome movie I would want to see over and over again. I will defiantly be buying it when it comes out on DVD."
"bob-rutzel-1","5","3","4","25 October 2010"," Okay, but not for small children
","The story takes up when Alice (Wasikowska) is about 18-yrs old, leaves a party after being asked to marry, sees a rabbit in a waist coat, follows the rabbit and falls down the hole again, but this time into a world called Underland. She has no memory of being there before.<br/><br/>If I were a child again and watched this adult version of Alice, I would go to bed every night with a light on. There was nothing wonderful about it. It was sort of scary, menacing, confusing, and frightful. Hey, when scary animals show their teeth in a menacing way I want no part of it even as an adult. Oh, the dialogue was good for the most part, but when we really get into the story and meet the Red Queen (Carter) we see no reason for children to see this. The Red Queen is mean as opposed to the White Queen (Hathaway) who is super nice. I forgot how many times the Red Queen shouted out, ""off with his/her head."" There is a way to be mean or not nice without being mean or not nice. Really, and the trick would have been be to incorporate some humor with the supposed meanness. See? Didn't happen. <br/><br/>I didn't see this in 3-D but on a DVD. Not sure if 3-D would have helped, but there is a awful lot of detail regarding colors etc in here.<br/><br/>I suppose the whole idea of the story is to transform Underland into Wonderland again and restore the White Queen to the throne. But to do that Alice needs to defeat the Jabberwocky, a fire breathing dragon. Is action hero Alice up to the job? Hmmmm..<br/><br/>The acting throughout was very good. I wouldn't have minded if Johnny Depp (Mad Hatter) was more animated and I think he should have been. He could have been the comic relief that was missing throughout. Didn't happen. He was too serious a Mad Hatter. His put-on smile doesn't count. <br/><br/>On the whole not bad, but not for small children. Let them read or read to them the original Alice in Wonderland and let it go at that. <br/><br/>You know, having a night light on at night isn't such a bad idea anyway. Hmmmm.. See, the movie did have some impact on me. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

","this movie is overdone, crazy visuals, over-dramatic characters and insane scenarios, a perfect representation of a story so many times made and so poorly done before.<br/><br/>Burton did with this story what other couldn't, it give it some sense but not making it *as many said* moralist, is still the derailed imagination of a man over a girl's life, is still lots of fantasy and magic with a lesson hidden, I know... Alice in Wonderland is not supposed to teach us anything, but I think it should, it was the journey of Alice from the girl who fell asleep to the young lady invited to share tea with adults, this is still a movie about the passing into adult life. and this time is not a passing after a lost or suffering, but with the same view her father had, impossible dreams that will come true if you fight for them.<br/><br/>Characters so well done, you still find the fairy tale characters, bad ones still dark, still no faces, good ones always expressive and colors and light. if you're older than that, there's so many layers you'll enjoy it the same, Johnny Depp was great, his mad hatter, brave and insane, and charming, wish he could get some recognition for this one, I liked him more than as Captain Jack.<br/><br/>Mia, the girl is stunning, pretty and talented, her Alice is soft and delicate, yet she's a fighter, you can see she's not afraid at all, even if at first she hesitated, both as character as an actress you see a fresh face and lots of potential.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham-Carter and Anne Hathaway did what they do all the time, both lost in the character, both amazingly well done.<br/><br/>the effects and other creatures, even the furniture, were amazing, the first time you see this movie you feel you're inside that world, you want to follow the white rabbit and get lost in a world of insanity and fun. <br/><br/>This movie brought me back to my first time in movies, magic that makes not only feel good, it changes you, gives you hope and that feeling of naive excitement you only feel as a child.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it. is my favorite movie this year no matter what comes after."
"zakfar2000","10","3","4","20 August 2010"," Not Bad! But not as good as previous Tim Burton's movies.
","Well, overall the film is good to watch. It will give you a NEW EXPERIENCE if you have already been through 'Alice in Wonderland' stories/movies. Helena Carter and Johnny Depp are as good as they always are, especially when they are teamed together to work in a Tim Burton movie. The only thing upsetting is Mia Wasikowska, and that's the thing that messed up everything. I mean, she is 'Alice', the main character of the movie. It's not that she is all a bad actress, but looks like the role didn't suite her perfectly well. I'm a great fan of Tim, Johnny and Helena, and I'm sad to know that I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did their previous efforts.<br/><br/>About the story I will say it started good. But it would have been more fun if this was not about WAR OF SISTER QUEENS. I mean, it could bring more emotion to the story if that was about freedom. In fact, looks like they missed the main spot where viewers were supposed to be emotionally connected to the story of battle. They did it rather quickly and did not show much to bring the right connection. Through watching the movie, I was more interested to see the environment and new characters, and did not care much about the War and the Battle. It was already exposed more than enough that Alice is going to slay the Jabberwock, which seemed to bring the concept of why Alice was brought down to Underland. I think there is serious trouble with Linda Woolverton's Writing. With such a marvelous Direction, Graphics and great bunch of actors, there could have been much more to this movie.<br/><br/>Call me a strict Judge for giving it 5/10. Somewhat might enjoy this movie greatly to give it 7+, but it could have been a lot better than this. And for me, Tim Burton's efforts has gone to vein because of Linda's script and Mia's bad role."
"rstef1","9","3","4","1 August 2010"," Tim Burton Triumphant
","Tim Burton gets to do here what he does best: fantasy with a dark edge. Just as he did with his modern fairy tale classic Edward Scissorhands, Burton takes a whimsically fantastic story and gives it some bite.<br/><br/>Remaining true to the characters and situations of the books, which for those of you who haven't read them had some dark edges of their own, Burton eschews some of the preciousness of the Disney cartoon version and makes the story more accessible to modern teens and adults while retaining the classic period feel. Depp and Bonham-Carter are perfect in their roles, and Wasikowska as Alice holds her own with them. The special effects are great. I loved the Cheshire cat and the blue caterpillar (voiced by the always excellent Alan Rickman); they really had personality though they were CG creations.<br/><br/>This is an amazing looking film that doesn't forget the importance of telling a good story. The screenwriter has done a great job of taking Alice's ""real life"" and weaving it into her journey through Underland, where she comes to a valuable realization and greater understanding of herself. A fine film for children and adults."

","Tim Burton one of my favorite directors ever. Tim has a way of making films his own even if they've been remade time and time again. I have seen one of the other versions of Alice and it was good but not great. With Tim's version it seems like a different film in some parts because it is a Tim Burton film. He usually makes awfully dark Gothic films however the element of darkness is there in Alice it also has the element of color as well which I think is really good. The lighting is nothing short of fantastic and the fx are great. It's very well done with it's production design as well. But to have an unknown Australian actress to play Alice at first I thought interesting casting. I was not disappointed Mia was great as Alice and I felt she fell into the character. Nice work Tim!"

"EUyeshima","8","3","4","4 April 2010"," Burton Doesn't Lose His ""Muchness"" with His Darkly Fanciful Take on the Lewis Carroll Classic
","Mad as a hatter and wildly audacious, this fantastical 2010 adventure turns Lewis Carroll's classic tale of surreal logic displacement on its ear. Who better to translate this story into a female empowerment parable than the master of quirky darkness, director Tim Burton, and his favorite muse Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter? The excesses of Burton's imagination, guided by Linda Woolverton's (""The Lion King"") sharp-tongued screenplay, result in a particularly idiosyncratic adaptation. Yet, as dazzling and sometimes scarifying as the computer-generated images are, the film is not overwhelmed by the visual elements and retains the basic themes of the original stories.<br/><br/>Combining elements of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" with its sequel, ""Through the Looking Glass"", the movie begins when a young Alice awakens from a nightmare in which she has visited Wonderland. The obviously precocious child questions her sanity to which her father assures her that it's fine to be ""bonkers"", all the best people are. Flash forward several years later, and Alice has become a rebellious nineteen-year-old on her way to a garden party where all the guests are to witness her being engaged to a patronizing fop named Hamish. She hesitates and asks for a moment at which point she chases a rabbit from her earlier dream into a hole. Perpetually shrinking and enlarging, she finds herself in not Wonderland but Underland where she sees all the talking creatures from her dream, but this time, they all question whether she is the real Alice. They all need the Alice of their collective memory, the one who would have no trouble defeating the monstrous Jabberwocky and ending the reign of the evil Red Queen.<br/><br/>Once Alice joins the Mad Hatter's party, it becomes clear she is not in a dream of her making, that she is being signaled to make her own way in life and within Underland, ensure that the virtuous White Queen be restored to the throne, even donning Joan of Arc-like armor for the climactic battle scene. Australian actress Mia Wasikowska (""The Evening Sun"", ""Amelia"") makes a terrifically wary Alice whose sense of wonder is tempered by her palpable search for self-confidence. As you would expect, Depp has the showiest role as the Mad Hatter, all leering smiles and electro-shock orange hair, and he makes the most of it despite an incongruous dance solo toward the end. With her head blown up three times its normal size, Helena Bonham Carter has a field day as the decapitation-crazed Red Queen as she barks orders at her lackeys and demands to be pampered with pigs being used as footrests.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast make the impressions needed within the dimensions of the story - Stephen Fry as the dapper but cowardly Cheshire Cat; Crispin Glover as the villainous Knave of Hearts tending to the Red Queen's absurd orders; Alan Rickman as the surly, hookah-smoking Caterpillar; and English comedian Matt Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, perhaps the most Disneyesque of the characters conceived here. Only Anne Hathaway disappoints in an arch turn as the White Queen, appearing to channel her Princess Diaries co-star, Julie Andrews, in accentuated ""Mary Poppins"" mode. All the production values are first-class from Robert Stromberg's wildly varied production design to Dariusz Wolski's rich cinematography and Danny Elfman's bombastic music score. The movie does meander at various points, primarily to establish the next story turn, but fans of Burton's and Depp's work shouldn't be too disappointed."

","I began by distrusting very much this 3D form as not adding any aesthetic value to any movie but after seeing this one I ended up by adhering fully to it. This is indeed maybe the best movie of this kind I have ever seen. The visual images and sceneries are splendorous, magnificent and fascinating, the special effects extremely well succeeded and really thrilling and the animated characters very well imagined and truly effective. The human roles are very well performed by all the actors and actresses involved and their make-up imaginative and convincing. The story of the return of Alice to the fantasy world of her childhood is really well conceived and told in original and beautiful terms. The cut rhythm is stunning and dazzling. In short, this is a movie which is imperative to see."
"Galina_movie_fan","6","3","4","22 March 2010"," Burton + Disney = Cheshire cat without a smile.
","I was not too excited about the upcoming 3D adaptation - continuation of the classical books by the English Math Professor of the 19th century known to the world as Lewis Carroll about the adventures of a young girl named Alice in the Wonder/Under-land. I consider the best adaptation of the book, the closest to its spirit directed by Jan Svankmajer in 1988. I went to see Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton in 3D because I remembered how wonderful it was to see Avatar few months ago in 3D. The 3D features in Alice are nice addition to the film, and I would never say that the Burton's film is not beautiful, and the Wonderland he creates is not magical and entertaining but I felt that something was missing. I wanted to be amazed, fascinated, to be changed constantly like Alice herself but it did not happen. While watching the film I was thinking, oh, it is so much like The Wizard of Oz for 21st Century - the Good Witch, the Wicked Witch, and the brave girl who returns to the world she visited once and can't forget. Then, during the final battle Alice transforms into a Jean of Arc - like warrior with the magic sword in the shining arms. The story of the grown up Alice that bookends the Wonderland visions seems to be written to make Alice who is not a child but a 19 years old in the film, an inspirational young woman, the early feminist. It's been a long time since I read fabulously twisted Carroll's stories but as far as I remember, their charm is in the captivating words games, in the unexplained and extraordinary strange situations and deliciously absurd characters. It is also in the ability to look on the same event from totally different perspective. Just remember how many times and how suddenly and instantly Alice changes her size and perception of unreal reality. Tim Burton and his screenwriter tried to give some logic and explanation to the world of dreams, fantasy and absurdity. As a result, the film turned into another version of the struggle between good and evil, which closely resembles the story of the girl named Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. I felt like in the struggle between Tim Burton, a highly creative, imaginative Artist who is at his best while producing the dark visions, and the Disney studio that financed the film, there is no convincing victory. For the film that was made to include the young children as the target audience, Alice is too dark, complex, and scary. For the older viewers open to any complexity coming from the union of Burton and Carroll made in the cinematic haven, the film is strangely dull, slow, and boring. It could be easily described by one simple equation, Barton + Disney = Cheshire cat without a smile. It is really strange because the production values of the film are very high, and the actors enjoy playing weird and creepy characters. It was pleasure to see Johnny Depp as a Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous big-headed Red Queen but I think that Crispin Glover deserves special mention as the Knave of Hearts, the personal assassin to the Red Queen and her confidant. <br/><br/>I don't regret seeing Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland at the theater but next time I want to see the cinematic equivalent of the Carroll's book, I'd pull from the shelf the DVD Jan Svankmajer's Alice which is still my favorite Carroll's adaptation."

"stagedlined466","2","4","6","31 January 2014"," An atrocity to behold
","When I heard that Tim Burton was going to be doing an Alice in Wonderland movie I was immediately hyped. When the movie finally rolled around I was ready to seen the adaptation the classic story ""deserved"". <br/><br/>The prologue seemed promising a young Alice with her father having some cute banter. But then we fast forward many years to find Alice as a teenager. One of my problems with the movie is I thought Alice was to old, if you read the book I think it's apparent that Carol intended her to be a young girl. But what they were going for and Alice returning to Wonderland after many years, I didn't let it bother me. <br/><br/>Alice and her mother go to merry-gathering where Alice meets people and witnesses events that I am sure is ""NOT AT ALL FORESHADOWING FOR LATER"". Watch The Wizard of Oz much? Among all forced story lines Alice is proposed to by a snooty young man, before she answers him she sees a white rabbit and follows him down a rabbit hole.<br/><br/>After a pretty impressive interpretation of the falling and the room with all the doors. We finally get to see the Wonderland we've been waiting to see. But to our dismay Wonderland looks like a boring CGI dung-heep. But if that wasn't enough we get to see some old favorite character but SURPRISE their boring too. The Wonderlanders think that Alice is the ""wrong Alice"" so they go see Absolen the caterpillar (So the caterpillar has a name now). Absolen brings out a scroll that tells the future and tells Alice she must slay the Red Queen's evil Jabberwocky and save ""Underland"" from her tyranny. This was the point of the movie I realized I'd been suckered in. <br/><br/>Not to long afterward we get to see Helena Bonham Carter as our villain. To be fair Carter is the best part of the movie and she really tries to get around the contrived writing. But even her character is written wrong. The famed phrase ""off with his head"" isn't fun anymore but instead we get to see the victim crying about how he has kids to look after. Wow it's like the producers just wanted everything fun or memorable about Carol's book to completely shove it down the drain. <br/><br/>But surly Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter can bring some light to the movie. Nope, surprisingly Depp is the biggest stick in the mud this film has to offer. I mean I like Johnny Depp as an actor but his performance in this movie is just plain awful; he some how turned this fun-loving, delightfully goofy character into some depressing emo guy. <br/><br/>Anyway Alice travels with the Hatter for a while until the hatter captured by the Queen's army. Alice then allies with a dog (voiced by Timothy Spall),and she takes part in crossing to castle mote by jumping across severed heads???? Wow when did this movie turn into ""The Killing Fields""? This Alice in Wonderland, leave scenes like this for Sweeney Todd Mr.Burton. So Alice infiltrates the Queen's court to find the vorpal blade the only weapon that can kill the Jabborwocky (I guess were in a Zelda game now). To make a long story short Alice finds the vorpal blade the Hatter and the dormouse try helping her escape but get arrested and Alice escapes on the Bandersnactch (oh a reference to the Jadderwocky poem, they'll think were're geniuses). <br/><br/>Alice escapes to The Red Queen's sister The White Queen played by a boring Anne Hathaway (I'm sure she ""Dreamed a Dream"" that she's to talented to play such a boring role). But meanwhile everyone is getting tried of Depp's bland performance and decide to send him to the block. But with the help from the Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephan Fry) the Hatter rallies to citizens of Wonderland (I'm not calling it Underland) to fight back at the Red Queen. But if you haven't hadn't had enough of contrived dark scenes the Queens sends out a giant bird to massacre everyone. <br/><br/>So our favorite characters gone wrong meet up with Alice and the White Queen and get ready for the final battle against the Red Queen and the Jabberwocky. But Alice is feeling pressure about having to kill the beast so she is once again visited by the caterpillar. The caterpillar then shows clips Alice exploring Wonderland as a child (Not a good idea showing what the movie should have been like) and that somehow makes Alice more confident and they set off to meet the Red Queen's army. <br/><br/>When they arrive Alice confronts the Jabberwocky (voiced by Christopher Lee) and slays it. And that somehow make the Red Queen's army betray her and The Queen is banished. And then we take part in the most awful, vomit worthy part of the movie; The Hatter starts break dancing :P. So after that death blow to everyone's childhood Alice decides to return home and confront the similar problems she had in her real life. We end with Alice apprenticing in her fathers business and heading off to see the world. <br/><br/>Overall Alice in Wonderland is a messy, devised, and just all round awful. It seems like the movie deliberately went out of it's way to destroy the magic of a beloved classic. They really didn't understand the purpose of Lewis Carol's work and instead turned it into a boring CGI Narnia knock-off. And I just heard that they are making a sequel. Well I learned my lesson and I'm going to stay far away from it. I'm sure in the future there will be other adaptations and maybe someone will hit it out of the park and do the story right. But until then I'll stick with my books and the 1951 animated film."
"Jerique","3","4","6","18 March 2011"," Burton's Disasterpiece.
","Very few movies by Tim Burton do I dislike. I am a huge fan of Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride, James and the Giant Peach, and Edward Scissorhands. However, Alice In Wonderland was dreadful.<br/><br/>Last year, I saw Alice In Wonderland, and I thought it was horrible. First of all, everything in this movie looks like CGI. It was like watching Avatar again, with different actors. I am amazed at the great computer graphics used and the good motion-capture, but even Johnny Depp said himself that it wasn't fun working on the film. It's a little distracting when you have to watch CGI in every scene of a movie. Did I say a little distracting? Every scene has CGI and it's beyond distracting.<br/><br/>I have to say that aside from CGI, this movie is a failure because of the story. I prefer the Alice In Wonderland film from 1999, for the simple fact that it's not grounded. It's a movie full of random events and it's not clouded by a bunch of CGI. It is not trying to be anything special or realistic. This story in Burton's Wonderland is grounded. What I mean is, these things that happen in the novel aren't random, and Alice has already been here before. She just doesn't remember (sound familiar -- Hook?). What annoys me most of all, is the overall finale to the story is she has to kill this creature, the Jabberwocky, which would allow for the White Queen to rule Underland (huh?) again and banish the Red Queen.<br/><br/>I couldn't stand the grounded story and due to the grounded story, this movie is not very comedic. I chuckled maybe twice? I remember laughing a lot at the 1999 film because of the rabbit and his teacup party friend. However, this movie is almost entirely a drama and due to the story it's very serious. It's not really a fun movie for anyone, least of all kids.<br/><br/>If you want a fun Alice In Wonderland movie, I'd suggest buying or renting the 1999 version which stars Tina Majorino as Alice. It's a much more superior version because it allows for unlimited story and it doesn't get overrun with CGI. It's more of a kids movie, as well."
"paul_haakonsen","5","4","6","15 January 2011"," Alice with a twist...
","Finally gotten around to see the new interpretation of ""Alice In Wonderland"" and with Tim Burton at the helm nonetheless. I had really high expectations for the movie...<br/><br/>...and now I sit here with a slight feeling of disappointment.<br/><br/>Why? Well the movie in itself was a typical Burton movie, with his unique style, touch of finesse, and impressions of the bizarre and remarkable. But somehow the movie just didn't leave that much of a lasting impression with me.<br/><br/>The scenery, sets and everything were what you expect of a Burton movie, twisted, dark, bizarre and absurd. And I love that, he has a very distinct touch and sense of detail. That makes all his movies unique in their own way.<br/><br/>The cast list was amazing, simply amazing. Of course it was Johnny Depp, as the Mad Hatter, who carried this movie, and his performance of this character was phenomenal. He always delivers a top notch performance no matter what. And Helena Bonham Carter, as the Red Queen, well she was good as well, something oddly crude about her performance in this movie, but it worked quite nicely. And of course Crispin Glover, as Stayne, he was also quite good in the movie. Alan Rickman was really well cast for a voice acting role, he has a very good and distinct voice. Now, I read that some didn't enjoy Mia Wasikowska in the role of Alice, I did however, find her to be quite enjoyable. She has a very serene and innocent radiance, and Burton managed to paint that out so well on the screen.<br/><br/>The CGI animations and effects in the movie were, of course, off the roof. The animated creatures were very real and life-like. And everything was just loaded with small details.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's re-invention of a classic is a good movie, and if you are a fan of his previous work, I am sure you will like this one as well. Now, I said that I was a bit disappointed, I guess it was because I had really high expectations to this movie. ""Alice in Wonderland"" is far from a bad movie, so don't get me wrong here. And it is good to see someone take classics and tell them again with a warped sense to it.<br/><br/>Oh, and the dance scene with Johnny Depp, well personally I think that was one scene that should have been either left out of the final cut, or have been shot in a complete other way. It didn't go well with me at all.<br/><br/>Great entertainment, but for me personally, this is hardly a movie that I will be picking up to watch again at a later time."
"CineMage","1","4","6","14 March 2010"," why are there so many eyes being stabbed in this film?
","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>We went to this film with high hopes. We left without them.<br/><br/>The film is surprisingly mean-spirited. For example, after the Red Queen sends off to his death a talking frog who serves her, she orders to have his children served to her as a meal since she adores ""tadpoles on toast almost as much as I adore caviar."" However, this same Red Queen is treated as childlike and amusing, and her acts of cruelty tend to be treated like burlesque slapstick by the camera direction and musical score.<br/><br/>The ""heroic"" White Queen is similarly cruel albeit in a dainty, soft-voiced fashion. Her cruelty, since it is mostly against the enemies she shares with the protagonists, are presented in the film as heroic.<br/><br/>The changes from the books are erratic. One moment, The Mad Hatter is happily odd; the next moment, he pitiably whimpers to Alice (with sympathetic musical score behind him) that he feels genuine fear that he might be losing his mind.<br/><br/>The film often seems to be plagiarizing the imagery of the Narnia films rather than replicating the Alice in Wonderland books. For example, the dormouse behaves like a bargain basement Reepicheep, and the line-up for the ""Final War"" resembles the ""lining up for war"" scene in the first Narnia film.<br/><br/>The Jabberwocky is true in appearance to the famous illustrations but otherwise painfully generic.<br/><br/>Finally, as I heard one person at the showing complain loudly, ""Why are there so many eyes being stabbed in this film?"""

","On its release last year I couldn't find much to fault Avatar on. But after watching Alice – the first serious CGI-dominated 3D film since James Cameron's immersive motion picture – there's now a glaring issue with it: the bar was set waaay too high. Previously the computer generated effects in Alice would have knocked your socks off, however in a post-Avatar world it significantly underwhelms. Not an overly fair statement for a film which has consistently beautiful and detailed images – take the awe-inspiring climactic clash which is set on a chess board-esquire battlefield for example – but you can thank Cameron for that. Once you get past the fact that Burton's creation does not aim to achieve realistic environments or creatures and that the actors will never appear to be anywhere other than in front of a green screen, you are in good stead to enjoy the colourful animation for what it was intended for: pure, undemanding, trippy wonderment.<br/><br/>It's a damn shame then that this meticulously crafted, psychedelic visual-journey isn't matched with a screenplay that was given just as much effort. The inbuilt metaphors of the Alice tale are still there however writer Linda Woolverton adds very little in the way of character development or plot undercurrents, seemingly intent on relying on the visual effects wizards and actors to contribute the extra layers. Her biggest missed opportunity is further exploration into the Mad Hatter or even the White Queen – both of whom are half-baked caricatures – with the Hatter coming off as a mere chance for Depp to be quirky, rather than the cleverly-written character with an interesting back story that he should have been. To Woolverton's credit though, she did manage to concoct some deliriously amusing dialogue for the Hatter and the Red Queen; a small highlight of her script which partially redeems her lack-lustre attempts elsewhere.<br/><br/>Kudos to Depp, then, that he still generates another memorable, albeit this time one-dimensional, on screen persona. He provides his Hatter with plenty of lovable eccentricities and rough edges, all the more noteworthy considering the non-existent depth to which the material affords him. He'll certainly be a hit with the kids. The rest of the cast are unpredictable in their output: Aussie newcomer Wasikowska overdoes it as the titular protagonist, Hathaway's saccharine White Queen grates on the nerves and the opaque Glover is unbearably boring as Stayne; whilst Carter's malevolent Red Queen is a hoot, Lucas induces a laugh or two as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, Rickman oozes noble charisma as the Blue Caterpillar and Paul Whitehouse's March Hare steals every single scene he is in.<br/><br/>Depp's usual strong performance and Burton's knack for striking visuals narrowly prevail over a shallow script and an unconvincing leading lady.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","In her engagement party, the indecisive nineteen year-old Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is proposed in a gazebo in front of the guests by the snobbish and arrogant nobleman Hamish (Leo Bill). Before giving the answer, Alice sees a strange rabbit and escapes, falling down through a hole in a magic world called Underland. After drinking and eating magic potions to reduce her height, Alice meets animals that can talk and the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Alice helps the good White Queen (Anne Hathaway) to defeat her evil and tyrannic sister Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and returns a more confident teenager. <br/><br/>""Alice in Wonderland"" is a visually astonishing movie with a deceptive story.

","I am a HUGE Alice in Wonderland fan.I have been waiting for this movie to come out since I 1st saw the previews. It was made by Tim Burton so of course it was going to be awesome right? WRONG! I will say the very beginning was not too bad. It seemed like everything was going fine and it was sticking to the original story. Once she opened the door to wonderland after growing and shrinking it went down-hill.<br/><br/>The effects were way too over done to the point where wonderland was not even believable. I really did not like how Tim Burton added so many new characters to it too. The white queen, the jabberwocky, the talking dog, etc Where was Dinah? (Alice's pet cat) from the beginning? The very merry un-birthday song? The singing flowers? (They only showed one for like a split second), Alice growing so big her arms and legs stick out of the white rabbits house? Bill and the Dodo bird? Tweedledee and Tweedledum telling their story of the little oyster's? ""The time has come the walrus said, to talk of many things.."" As a big fan I just feel like these were important and memorable points to the story that makes us love it so much.<br/><br/>The cast was pretty impressive I must say. Only thing was that Johnny Depp's make up was a little fake looking in the tea party scene because they painted his face white but stopped at his neck so it just looked too fake. Also when the red queen's friends had their noses and ears falling off as if they were really just prostetics was a horrible idea I did not understand that. Though the cast was well and so was the acting, I felt like the white queen was not necessary and to honest could she put her hands down for just a min?! I almost feel like since Tim Burton put Depp in the movie that he had to expand and change the story up to give him a longer role because of course Johnny Depp couldn't be in this for just a few minuets like the original mad hatter was in the story. Honestly the mad hatter was not a huge or important character.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about more but these are the main things I could not stand. This is the 2nd film Tim Burton had re-made and turned it into trash. I actually love Tim Burton and all of his moves from the 80's and 90's but now he is loosing his touch and I feel like he just giving into the modern cgi crap that everyone does nowadays. He was a unique director but I just cant connect with his films anymore its a shame. Don't get me wrong I know he probably wanted to add a little newness to it but it just didn't work at all. If he would of just stuck to the original storyline it could of made up for the crappy cgi effects."

","I wasn't sure what to really expect when I heard ""Alice"" was going to be made into a full length film...but considering that Tim Burton was going to direct, I knew it would be awesome to watch. Johnny Depp was perfect as The Mad Hatter and the other characters were done well too. I did think The Red Queen could have been a little more mean and well..we didn't get to see enough of the March Hare or the Cheshire Cat as I would have liked. Even though Johnny Depp was a main character, it was clear that Alice was the focus of the film, which made it even better. I am certain the true fans of the Alice story will find faults with the film..of course...but as far as it being great entertainment..it was and then some. Watching it in 3-D..which I did not get to do as yet, will be a real sensory treat for sure. Enjoy the film for what it is..not for what everyone else might think it should be."

There were some pitch perfect portrayals. Stephen Fry is excellent as the Chesire Cat (my favorite version of this cat). Mia is wonderful as Alice. Johnny Depp continues to earn my deep admiration as an actor. His Mad Hatter was spot on, as they say. It was thoroughly enjoyable and I found myself grinning like the Chesire cat at the end. All the way home. I loved the Scottish accents as well. Roger Ebert didn't like the action scenes, but I felt they were a great addition and not too long. It was such a visually brilliant movie.

Tim Burton definitely achieved the title of creepy for this movie because it was funny yet filled with macabre at the same time. All in all, I would absolutely recommend it for someone who isn't going in with a negative attitude, and honestly I would watch it with an open mind. Remember, this movie is for fun!

","If there ever was a strong case of plagiarism it would be Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, who incidentally acknowledged he never really liked the story to begin with. And boy, does it show. <br/><br/>Aside from occasionally beautiful set pieces (all CGI) Mr Burton manages to take the story (both the 1951 Disney version as the original book) and butcher nearly everything that was good about it. Originally Alice dreamt up this world to rebel against the status quo she was raised in, only to discover that in random madness she would not find more sense or happiness then in the reality of her own world. <br/><br/>No more random madness, no more 'coming of age' revelations, no, Tim Burton instead steals the story of Wonderland and all its characters, twists and turns it into something that only slightly resembles it and becomes like unwashed laundry; stale, muff and in need of a thorough clean up."
"ahycjjo","4","10","21","5 March 2010"," Stylish but no substance
","Waiting in line for a while for the film, the fact that its a big title with big Hollywood stars - even perhaps, other than Avatar the biggest film this year, I approached this film with high hopes. The film visually is very impressive, the 'Wonderland' created is striking and the character designs are done well and in a Tim Burton-esquire fashion. The layout is not however as Gothic as other Tim Burton works, which for some may come as a relief. The acting on the whole also wasn't too bad. Not the best Johnny Depp performance that I think he has produced, but nevertheless a good performance and an interesting take on the Mad Hatter character. The other characters in the film do not however seem to receive enough character development for the audience to comfortably get into the story, which in many respects seems frayed and untidy. The plot itself is something of a let down. Being distant from the original naturally would annoy fans of the original text, and annoyed me a little bit; but this isn't the direction Burton was approaching so I suppose it is understandable. The plot however seems to diverge too far from the original FEEL of Alice in Wonderland; the storyline features a much more predominant Mad Hatter (Thankgod cos it probably saved the film) and some storyline twists such as the duel with the Jabberwocky towards the end seemed rushed, largely out of place and bizarre. As a result the audience can never really get into the film because the plot doesn't seem to be written well enough to draw the viewer into an interesting or gripping story. The 3d effects are no Avatar standard but still add to the film, but I don't feel that seeing the film in 2d would effect the entertainment value greatly. I would give it 4 stars because there are worse films out there, and the acting (notably Stephen Fry providing the voice of the Cheshire Cat and Depp as the Mad Hatter) enable the film to not be a farce. In the end for lovers of the original I warn you to stay away or be disappointed;for many who see this as a big film which might be worth seeing I don't think it lives up to the hype. The film also seems to succeed in spite of rather than due to Burton's plot. 4/10 Not great, but not terrible. Having viewed it in the cinema I don't feel it has enough draw to warrant a DVD purchase"

","So much 3D, so little sense... The movie has hardly anything to with the classic book ""Alice in Wonderland"". That is, besides a few names of main characters, and a couple of misplaced quotes (for instance, it's the Queen who supposed to be able to believe in several impossible things before breakfast, not Alice). Alice is mutated into a kind of medieval ""La Femme Nikita"", completely ruining the rich images and references of the book. Incoherent beginning of the movie (where Alice suddenly show her feminist side) and inane ending (where Alice becomes a kind of startup manager in an emerging market) just add insult to injury."

It looked nice, very visually pleasing but the story put me to sleep. There was no real action to speak of. I didn't feel anything at all for the characters. It seems like all movies these days seem to stink. I loved Avatar and My Sister's Keeper made me cry. Is Charlie and the Chocolate factory any better? I keep trying to like Tim Burton movies.

","Huh. OK, where from should I start?! Maybe to explain what was good, because the list is shorter than what was bad. Visually, this was one of better movies I've seen lately: colorful, great imagination (hm, I mean the combination of an ""old"" Alice and several other Burton's movies), and astonishing effects (although I haven't seen it in 3D, the effort is quite visible). Helena Bonham Carter was giving her best, and that's so obvious in every second she spent on screen. Both rabbits were great, and so were cards and other supporting characters. And now, back to reality. Johnny Depp was AWFUL! And I'm one of his biggest fans. So is with Tim Burton - almost every other work was great, there were several lame movies, but he's definitely one of my favorite directors. At least, he was. How is it possible to make such a crappy movie from the story as extraordinary as Alice in Wonderland is?! Well, easy: if the dialogs are lame, plot line does not exist and you are so much in love with yourself you think of you as the mastermind of all fictional movies that could not possibly make some mistake and any frigging crap you role in shiny paper would make some money.

","So a mixed-age adult group of around 20 of us went and caught the 3-D version last night. Most loved it, some liked it, one thought it was OK. There were laughs in the theater, and some ""awwwwwwws"". My take: Tim Burton came through for me again. Although I like his bittersweet work, I was pretty worried when he started tinkering with ""Alice"" and ""Looking Glass"" - the travesty! Now I see the advantage (although some critics bemoan the loss of randomness and whimsy) of having a cohesive narrative, we all cared about the story and cared about the characters and how things would end up. To me it seems as those this ""Alice"" is a well-fitting sequel to the originals.<br/><br/>Great casting with all, Mia as Alice did a fine credible job as the now older Alice. And Depp - due to some negative remarks I was suspicious of what I was going to see, but once again we felt he was superb - his faintly dark, sometimes sad, sometimes scary Hatter was one you didn't take your eyes off on screen, and he pull off another mad, complex, shifting portrayal with intelligence and aplomb. Much has been said about HBC's Red Queen and all the positive remarks are fully justified. As one friend of mine said, with Burton you have to watch carefully as he slyly slips in all these delightful little details within the sets and the actors - as always he is simultaneously tongue-in-cheek, bitter, and sweet.<br/><br/>I would rate this a ten except for what I felt were a few weak details at the end, but nothing that would ruin the movie and certainly all us were happy to have seen it. A few dark Burton details suggest this is NOT for young children, and it wouldn't be appreciated, so rent the young ones the Disney cartoon version. Hoping to see it again and I will be buying it. As far as 3-D, well that was fun too, but I hope having seen it once I can take in more of the set pieces and a few missed lines. When I asked an older gentleman with us if he liked the film, he said ""What's not too like?"" Definitely worth the ticket price, I see some nay-sayers pick this to death and they are entitled, but what we felt was a little ""Burton"" sadness about life and growing up, and a lot of joy. For sure on the way out there was no complaining from the crowd, just a lot of chatter about the performances and sets."

","I am a very big fan of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton and I have to say this is another great movie done by the both of them. I like how Tim Burton took a twist on Lewis Carroll's books, Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. I also like that this movie takes place after the books and yet Tim keeps the same elements from the book in the movie. Johnny Depp did a very good job at expressing the Mad Hatter. Johnny Depp, played the Mad Hatter as I expected. He literally became the character, which is one of the reasons he is an outstanding actor and one of the most versatile at that.I understand why he did the different voices; it was a way to give the Hatter more depth and show the different sides of his character. No, Johnny didn't mess up. When he was angry he had one voice and when he was in thought it was another and so on and so forth. The Mad Hatter has so many conflicting personalities and so Johnny was trying, I think, to express all of them. Whenever the Hatter's mood changed so did the voice. The art was beautifully done. Alice in Wonderland is supposed to be crazy, colorful, and fantasy. I don't understand why people would question this part of the movie. It was very well done. The other characters were equally good. I loved the Cheshire Cat and the Red Queen. I found this movie to have comedy and serious parts all mixed up into one. I liked that it wasn't your usual Alice in Wonderland. Tim took his creativity and Lewis Carroll's mind and melded them to make this movie. The elements of the movie were overall very well done. I cannot wait for the next Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration, whenever that may be."

","I have been waiting for this film for two years ever since it was announced that Tim Burton was directing it. He is my idol and an immense inspiration for my artwork(Yes I'm an artist).<br/><br/>I saw the mid-night premiere with my friends and it was beautiful. Although I got a little hurt from the internet trolls(who are pretty much the same ones who didn't like Burton's Charlie & the chocolate factory) afterward.<br/><br/>Admitedly, the storyline is rather thin and predictable, but the visuals and the wonderland (sorry, Underland) characters make the film worthwhile. Mia Wasikowska was perfect for the role of Alice.Johnny Depp turns in another oddball performance as the mad hatter with a bit more gravity than most interpretations of the character. Helena Bonham Carter as the red queen is another major scene-stealer giving off the personae of a bratty toddler that fits in with the demented feel of Underland. This was the first time I appreciated Anne Hathaway in a role, her performance as the white queen is creepy and freaky. Crispin Glover also turns in an amusing role as Stayne(Knave of Hearts).<br/><br/>The animal characters are given perfect voice talents. The hight lights being Paul Whitehouse's March Hare who is absolutely hilarious and Stephen Fry's Chesire Cat with a seductive creepiness. Barbara Windsor and Timothy Spall also turn in amusing takes as the dormouse(the complete opposite of most interpretations of the character) and as the Bloodhound.<br/><br/>The style of Underland is wonderfully Burton-esquire with a Gothic feel particularly around the second act of the film. Overall, this is not a film for everyone especially those who are purist fans of Lewis Carroll's writings.This is more of a sequel than an actual adaption. younger children will probably be frightened a bit.

","To be honest I was expecting so much more from all the hype building up to this film's release. Burton has more than obviously juxtaposed the relationship between good and evil, however this is not what Alice in 'Underland' is about. I was hoping to see a graphical dive into the creativity and imagination of Alice's mind, however what we are presented with is an idolised view of each individual character thrown together in a weak and see through plot about power. The story has no originality, and throughout I was noting similarities between 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.' C.S Lewis may be in touch about copyright.

There, Now we can begin.<br/><br/>I'm going to try to be as unbiased as possible, but I cannot promise anything. I've been waiting on this film for what seems like forever, and I have to say I am absolutely thrilled with the final film. Last night, I got to pre-screen the film in 3D and it's absolutely breathtaking. I mean, it's no 3D Avatar, but the 3D is incredible. Wonderland is absolutely wondrous. The scenery is everything you could hope for and more. Both castles in the film are beautiful, I would love to see replicas somewhere down the road somewhere. Whether as toy models or at a Disney theme park somewhere.<br/><br/>The Acting in the film is everything you could as for a Tim Burton film. And they Styling of the movie is amazing. For me, the film reminded me of ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" The acting was quirky like Charlie, while the style of the film was very dark as Sweeney Todd. I loved it!<br/><br/>A lot of people say Johnny's portrayal of Mad Hatter was a lot like Willy Wonka, and I have to say I disagree. Wonka was insane. The Mad Hatter is mad. For me, the Hatter had his own personality. And once you see the film, I think you will agree. While in parts, there are similarities, I don't think that it's fair to say the character as a whole is Willy Wonka reincarnated. I guarantee if Wonka and Hatter were able to speak to each other you'd get to very separate individuals..just saying.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter was wonderful as the Red Queen. She was probably one of my favorite characters in the film. Utterly brilliant performance. <br/><br/>And the rest of the cast was absolutely great as well. But for me, The Hatter and Red Queen stood out just a tad more for me.<br/><br/>Go see the film. You won't be disappointed. Don't show up late, that is a very important thing. And if you can fork out the cash, wait until you can see it in 3D."
"Shalotka","4","7","14","27 March 2010"," A story lacking meaning and absurdity at once.
","When I first heard that Tim Burton and a whole squadron of actors I've already loved in other films are working on their version of ""Alice"" I was thrilled. Especially because I've read Tim Burton's poetry and I thought that if he and Lewis Carrol lived in the same era they would just love to spend time together telling each other unbelievable stories while having tea and oysters. Needless to say I was wrong.<br/><br/>The first question that comes to my mind is in what era the minds of the creators of this movie got stuck. A story about emancipation would have been big in the 1960s, while a story about a young person slaying a dragon would have become cult among teenagers in the 1980s. Yet we are in the year 2010, when the visual effects developed much, but the poor storyline is far less innovative that the books which became famous over a century ago.<br/><br/>The visual effects, however, are no big argument in favor of the movie. It could have been the theater's fault, the angle or just my eyes, but in many places the picture seemed out of focus or with low contrast and there were no breathtaking 3D effects. So the pleasure of seeing it in 3D didn't make up for the weird adaptation as it happened in the case of ""Beowulf"".<br/><br/>Lewis Carrol's books hasn't become popular because of their plot, but because of playing with logic, illustrating the literal meaning of conventional phrases with nonsensical situations and bringing the characters from proverbs and nursery rhymes to life. These creatures had all the right to act illogically, because they were nothing but meaningless words trying to become real in Alice's dream. Tim Burton's movie did have a plot, which was unfortunately the most banal one - the title character has to accomplish a quest because apparently no one else can. All the minor characters for some reason have got new names, but not a bit of personality.<br/><br/>Certain situations could seem repetitive for a person who had read the books or seen any of the earlier ""Alice"" movies, yet I imagine it would be difficult to understand the movie without having any previous ""Alice"" experience. I would recommend knowing the ""Jabberwocky"" poem by heart just to be able to grasp all the nonexistent words that appear in the movie and to know why they are there at all.<br/><br/>Since we are faced with a simple plot and flat characters we should be able to recognize their motives and goals. In fact we can only draw the conclusions that the Red Queen is evil and she shall not rule the land because she shouts a lot, the White Queen is good and she shall rule the land because she is pretty, and only Alice and no one else but Alice shall slay the dragon because... well, because! Frankly speaking I fail to see any more reason behind Alice's quest. The division into good and evil is being forced upon us without proper argumentation. Since it is no longer an adventure of a child but of a young adult we could have expected that the story and the world would be more complex and intellectually challenging, yet we face the exact opposite - everything has been painfully simplified.<br/><br/>The final questions are: what did the director want to tell us through this picture? What have our heroine achieved and learned during her adventure? Has Alice learned that she doesn't have to obey all the rules of the real world and rather be herself? I'm sorry to say, but such a movie was made in 1999 (the one in which Whoopi Goldberg played the Cat). Has Alice found out that she can be smart and independent? This role was not convincing enough when it comes to these two traits. Or is the message of the movie that we shall be imaginative because we can make good money of it? That's exactly what Alice's father believed and also what I think Alice and the creators of the movie have really understood."

","I won't write much about acting or lack thereof. Most of the cast was covered in excessive makeup and CGI after all.<br/><br/>My issues are with the movie itself, not the style. It seems to me that Tim Burton just seems to lose interest after he's done creating the characters and their surroundings. Then it all just bores him and he stops trying. One might suspect Tim Burton would have a difficult relationship with Disney. And I believe that relationship might be responsible for a lot of things other reviewers pointed out. On so many levels the movie feels more like an attempt to sabotage Disney than a movie of Burton's dreams that he wanted to make for the last 10 or so years.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm just making up a conspiracy theory and Tim Burton just personally hates the character of Alice. So he made her do (upon return from the Wonderland) something that contradicted the point of all his previous movies. <br/><br/>In other news: animators failed to animate almost everything."

","Alice In Wonderland (2010) Review By Dylan (http://www.dylanreviews.ning.com) Alice in wonderland, a timeless tale now in the hands of director Tim Burton (Willie Wonka, Edward Scissor hands) brings his usual suspects Johnny Depp (Pirates Of The Carrabian, Willie Wonka) and Helena Bonham Carter (Harry Potter, Corpse Bride) along with Anne Hathaway (Valentines Day, Get Smart) and new upcoming Aussie Actress Mia Wasikowska (Defiance, Rogue) to the table to bring his vision of the tale to the big screen, also in 3D. The story presumes mostly you know the basic tale of Alice In Wonderland and stars 13 years after her original adventure where she has lost all memory of ever having going to wonderland in the first place. This sequel is not to be confused with Lewis Carrol's actually sequel to his original Alice In The Wonderland tale, this follows its own path and story written by Linda Woolverton (The Lion King, Beauty & The Beast) Upon entering wonderland Alice will meet usual characters like the white rabbit (Michael Sheen), Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas) along with The Mad hatter, the hair (Paul Whitehouse), cheesier cat (Stephen Fry) , red and white queen and all the original characters. Alice is for-told a future set that she will save everyone from the red queen by slaying her evil beast in a battle and so begins Alice's adventures in wonderland. The story starts out well and sets a good mood unfortunately it seems a bit rushed at time, like its brushing past this plot point to more quickly to a part it thinks is better and more interesting part of the film than what your watching. More time is spent of the Mad Hatter and his development through out the film then Alice, which is annoying as she is the heroine and main character. This might not bother some people but if your gonna make more character for the Hater give the movie to him not Alice. The fight scene also wasn't very interesting, it was very quick and lame in general and when the whole movie is leading up to this moment you are setting there expecting something much more extravagant. Every actor in this movie give a all good performance and does well bring there characters to life. Johnny Depp does a fantastic job bring the mad hatter a new side of character that hasn't been seen before, Matt Lucas does well playing both Tweedledee and Tweedledum and Anne Hathaway also does fantastically as the White queen. Every other small part played is also done well and without fail, Crispin Glover as the Knave of hearts to Alan Rickman as the blue caterpillar. Mia Wasikowska as Alice is good in parts but you have problems with her acting towards the end as she seems to not grow much through out the film and although apparently losing her muchness, when she gets it back her personality doesn't seem much changed apart from the ability to saw yes to more things. The film looks fantastic, Tim Burton's vision of what Wonderland is presented perfectly with a mixture of dark and beautiful colors. The creatures and characters all look there parts and the score from Danny Elfman never fails to match the mood great. Its a pity that you never see and great shots of wonderland apart from the start which is only short. The 3D in this movie was produced after the final production so its not all that great, its OK and when its working well it is doing a great job. Unfortunately it also has some flaws in it and a bit much time was spent on creating effects that pop things out of the screen then on the rest of the movies 3D in general. In general i think id enjoy watching this movie without 3D a lot more as some things were annoying. The movie is all but perfect but is very fun, it has a very good cast to carry you through one of the most enjoyable worlds to enter that will leave you wanting to return as soon as possible. Alice in Wonderland is defiantly worth checking out, younger child will enjoy (just not to young as there are a couple frightening scenes) so shall older kids, adults and even older types. Returning to Wonderland through Tim Burton's looking glass was as ever enjoyable as his past adventures, id suggest getting out and seeing this one at the cinemas tomorrow.

"alex_7140","8","5","9","6 August 2010"," A very enjoyable movie, even in 2D
","I missed this movie when it ran on IMAX, but I finally saw it on my home TV today, in 2D. After reading the reviews here, somehow I'm glad I didn't saw it in 3D, as I might have had high expectations, and disappointment by comparing the visual effects with Avatar's.<br/><br/>I found the new Alice to be a refreshing view of the original story, which we all know and are over-bored with. It was funny to see how they imagined Wonderland to evolve in time, yet keeping the same fictional characters. The visual effects give depth to the 'wonderland' feeling, and are remarkably well done.<br/><br/>This movie is a classical story of a girl adventuring in a fantasy world and discovering the courage inside her, which will help her deal with the issues in her real life. Even if the story is predictable, the movie is never boring. I really enjoyed watching it!"
"tnt80808","1","5","9","16 July 2010"," Edward Scissorhands part 25?
","Actually it isn't, Scissorhands was original at least! It was a long time ago that I tired of Burton's ""style"", but at least in the past his movies had a good pace and interesting story despite being visual carbon copies of his earlier successes.<br/><br/>Alice in wonderland is a prime example of Burton relying on his tried and tested money making formula, ""well if it ain't broke, don't fix it"", right? Well Tim, it is broke! This movie never takes off, it merely lumbers along at yawn inducing pace. The characters, sorry, people who appear on screen (there is nobody with character in this movie) are either boring, shallow or just plain strange and not the good Tim Burton kind of strange, the ""what the hell was that!!"" kind of strange! I direct you in particular to Depp's bizarre Scottish freak outs. By the end of the movie you don't really care who won or lost the final battle (battle being a term I use loosely) you just imagine Tim Burton raking his hands through YOUR money laughing hysterically. I actually can't think of particular sections of this movie to mock, purely because it was so bland, nothing stuck in my mind.<br/><br/>The visuals, while mildly interesting, feel underdeveloped and we really have seen it all before. Mainly in Burtons other films. Which brings me neatly to the soundtrack, yes, you guessed it Danny Elfman, AGAIN! The score could easily be mistaken for any of Elfman's previous soundtracks and doesn't fit the movie well at all, it really makes you wonder why Burton continues to give this guy work???<br/><br/>Being a fan of the original story and Tim Burton's early work, I really wanted to like this movie. It seemed the perfect adaptation for Burton. A chance to put his gloomy spin on a story that always needed a dark and twisted edge. Unfortunately it feels like all involved just sleepwalked their way through it. I honestly can't think of a redeeming feature in this movie. A very boring and poorly put together adaptation."
"jasongbeale","1","5","9","29 April 2010"," This is NOT Alice in Wonderland
","This is NOT Alice in Wonderland. It is a completely different story piggybacking on a timeless classic that should be left alone!! It is a Disney-Hollywood bowdlerization, which is a cross between Lord of the Rings and Shrek. If I had children I would give them the book and forbid them from seeing this garbage. <br/><br/>This is NOT Alice in Wonderland. It's 'what if Alice was grown up and returned to Wonderland and saved it from a fictional dragon'. In other words it has a predictable moronic plot, in which the subtle mystery of Alice in Wonderland is reduced to a sword and sorcery B-grade epic. <br/><br/>By the way 'I loved the special effects' (so what) 'Oooh it's in 3D too' (so what). Let's be serious. Lewis Carroll would sue Tim Burton to Timbuktoo if he was still alive."
"scotthad","1","5","9","26 April 2010"," I really wasn't that great, could have been so much more
","Sure it was called ""Alice in Wonderland"" and had Johny Depp as a lead actor, but the movie really didn't live up to it's potential and I'm quit surprised that it had nearly zero appeal to me. I absolutely loved the original Alice in Wonderland, such a brilliant and creative film.<br/><br/>This one just plain didn't make sense, not in a way that was intended to be creative and imaginative but it was confusing and many scenes seemed like they had no purpose or meaning to the story.<br/><br/>Sure visually there were good aspects to it, and they had the big name actors and directors and such behind it, but when it comes right down to it a bad movie is a bad movie no matter what title or actors are a part of it.<br/><br/>The actress who played Alice was not that appealing either, she lacked acing skills and seemed so out of place. Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter was just so ridiculous that it went beyond being Mad to being psychotic and delusional (As bad as his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory roll). Everything was just blown out of proportion and they needed to knock it down to a more realistic level, and had a story that at least made sense and tied in somehow. Some scenes were straight from the classic movie but slightly modified to be more appealing somehow but that all failed, honestly I was just waiting for the movie to end from nearly the first scene."
"Herbest8","6","5","9","16 April 2010"," Very entertaining but somewhat lacking
","The idea of Tim Burton directing a live action/animated crossbreed of the famed nonsense story ""Alice in Wonderland"" seems like a match made by the arch angels of cinema heaven and even though the final result is pretty good, you can't help but feel a sense of botched potential.<br/><br/>The story is slightly tweaked from Lewis Carroll's original. Thirteen years after her original visit, Alice is lured back to Wonderland (or Underland, apparently) in order to fulfill her destiny: slay the monstrous Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>First off, this film has many great virtues: the visual style is perfect (with Burton nicely contrasting the real and fantasy worlds), there's a shipload of great performances, and the movie moves at a good pace. Plus, it's fun to see the the magnificent Christopher Lee and Michael Gough in a movie again.<br/><br/>However, on the whole, there's something amiss. Although fun and entertaining, it's sad that Burton didn't just do a straight version of the original book. On top of that, Johnny Depp turns in a shockingly two-dimensional performance and the infamous ""futterwacken dance"" is a little out of place.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Alice in Wonderland"" is something special but feels a little empty."
"blackmamba99971","10","5","9","16 March 2010"," A wonderful story
","I like this film, to see the under land in full swing with Johnny Depp at the helm as the mad hatter. I thoroughly enjoyed his performance seeing his character walk off the deep end. For Alice to remember her place in under land as the slayer of the Jabberwocky the first time and to see her do it the second time was quite fascinating. I loved how Helen Bonham Carter played the evil Queen of hearts with the famous line, 'OFF WITH HER HEAD'. Her head was so huge, it was like watching a balloon speaking with plastered on makeup. And let's not forget, the Cheshire cat, his ability to mist himself was magical. All in all it was quite a satisfying movie of a classic story that kids love even today. Tim Burton did a great job with his vision of dark against light, evil against good, and tea time players which dance on the table with extra zest in their tiny brains who cannot answer to the riddle, 'Why is a raven like a writing desk?'. Seems to bother some people with this conundrum, lest he or she drinks too much tea and waits for oranges to pop out of a toaster oven, wearing late night knickers and a bonnet. Oh that's right, I forgot oranges don't pop do they?"
"kianam-geo","10","5","9","14 March 2010"," Loved this film!
","I knew going into this film that it would not be the same Alice story that Lewis Carroll wrote, but rather a reinterpretation of the story. SyFy did their own modern day version of Alice that had a similar feel to it as well, but not quite as fantastical. I truly enjoyed Tim Burton's take on the story, and can't see how anyone wouldn't fall in love with it. The writing was excellent, the graphics vivid, the costumes to die for. And the story itself has such parallels with the real world itself. It just takes an intuitive mind to read into the story enough to see them. It's not just Alice in Wonderland. It's Alice in Underland, the land underneath everything. It's just a brilliant film, and the 3D aspect makes it literally pop off the screen. I urge you to disregard the bad reviews and see it for yourself. The old Alice in Wonderland story was a silly tale of fantasy, and this one adds just a touch of darkness, as only Burton can imagine."
"hossainferdous","9","5","9","13 March 2010"," Alice in Wonderland
","Definitely Tim Burton's Best!! This movie, from scene one, will catapult you into a Wonderland! Johnny Depp's fine acting takes the front seat, even though he comes in after the first half. You stop and ask yourself 'Did Depp just out do himself?' Hathaway is seemingly charming in her character, and though you would expect Wasikowska to steal the show, it's an out and out Depp movie. I personally thought Wasikowska (I didn't know her at all before this movie) could have done a more convincing job, in the title role. Helena Bonham character, even though was meant to be menacing, gets lost in the crowd! Excellent special effects, brilliant acting and kudos to Tim Burton for such direction. Spend the $18 to see it at the IMAX and get ready for a 2-hr journey to the magical world of Alice!! Without a doubt, a solid A."
"mombot","9","5","9","11 March 2010"," A ""trippy"" trip
","After reading a few negative reviews from critics, and glowing reviews from ""non-critics"" and critics, I found this movie to be very enjoyable for most ages, though kids under 7 might find it too scary.<br/><br/>Most of the actors that did voice work, such as Alan Rickman as the hookah-smoking caterpillar, Tim Spall as the Bloodhound, and Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, did superb work. While the other actors did good work, these characters stood out for me. My only disappointment, and it was small, was with Matt Lucas as the Tweedles. My kids laughed at their antics, but I wasn't as amused.<br/><br/>Of the ""real"" people in Underland, I found the Red Queen, the White Queen and the Mad Hatter as the best (getting to Alice in a bit). The Knave of Hearts, played by Crispin Clover, just didn't seem to really ""get"" the whole idea behind the fantasy. He's not terrible, but something just seems to be missing in his performance. (Not an opinion shared by my fellow movie-watchers, though.) That brought my rating down a point. The Hatter recites a part of my favorite poem from ""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland"" and he does it so well, I wish he'd been able to recite the entire poem. I'm not going to tell you which one. Johnny Depp is easily the best ""thing"" in this film. He gets the crazieness, the strangeness of it all, though Helena, Anne and Mia (Alice) are just as good.<br/><br/>Alice finds that she needs to be assertive and for some, this is a feminist message. I don't know why that doesn't sit well with certain people, but it does. I thought it was a good message, not letting other people decide your destiny, especially when it feels completely wrong. This movie is worth seeing in IMAX 3D or even in 3D (seen it twice, and in both formats), though the Cheshire cat really comes ""alive"" in IMAX 3D. 9/10."
"itsmesarahharris","3","8","17","6 March 2010"," career low for Tim Burton
","My immediate reaction after watching this film was 'worst film ever'. on reflection of course there's at least 'Mama Mia', 'Maiden Noyage' and a few 'Police Academy' films that are worse, but it's so far below the standards i'd expect from a Burton film i would probably enjoyed sitting through 'Police Academy 26' or whatever less excruciating. Mind you, it's probably so much better in 3D?<br/><br/>On the plus side, the kids say they enjoyed it - they were never going to be that discerning given the limited number of years they've had to develop an understanding of what constitutes a good movie. The under fives were both nearly asleep about two thirds of the way through. Depp was fantastic as a slightly melancholy spaced out eccentric hatter, I really sensed his heart and soul had been put into that character one hundred percent. He does love playing the wacky Brit after all. The other big names phoned, faxed or emailed their performances, clearly finding no magic in the screenplay to work with. Which is no surprise. A special commendation is due to Bonham-Carter for her fine impression of Miranda Richardson playing Queen Elizabeth the first in 'Blackadder'.<br/><br/>In trying to make 'Alice in Wonderland' meets 'Shrek' meets 'the Ring trilogy' the filmmakers have managed to throttle all the charm and whimsy out of Lewis Carroll's world, leaving the movie devoid of the dreamlike fairytale atmosphere that has up till now been a hallmark of Tim Burton's films. I would write more, but i'm finding it depressing and annoying to remember how little i enjoyed the experience.<br/><br/>NB 'Planet of the Apes' was also devoid of a dreamlike fairytale atmosphere, it wasn't quite as crud as 'Alice...' mind."

","I have only ever written a couple of reviews, but people are so divided on this one that i felt compelled to voice my opinion on it.<br/><br/>I was so looking forward to this, Tim Burton, Disney, Alice in Wonderland, what a combo! I was counting down the days until it's release.<br/><br/>Unfortunately as soon as the film started I just kept waiting to be sucked in. I was on the outside of this film right up until the end, never included in the story, never involved. I wasn't routing for anyone, I couldn't relate to anyone. Each character had the ability to be fantastic (Stephen Fry as the Cheshire cat for example) but were just hugely underdeveloped and not used to their advantage.<br/><br/>Alice was hugely irritating in my opinion, not a great actress and very boring, I didn't care for her or what happened to her. The tea party scene annoyed me too, the 'madness' wasn't fun to watch, just left me confused and as if I was missing something. 'That's the point!' fans will say, but it still has to be enjoyable, relate-able, surely?<br/><br/>The white queen, very unlikeable, yet we were supposed to be on her side? I know everyone is meant to be crazy and off-the-wall but at least make her strong, kind, friendly? She seemed like a Lady Gaga impersonator on drugs.<br/><br/>The effects were not as good as Avatar, it was as though they didn't really use the 3D. The Cheshire cat could have been right up in our faces, the Jabberwocky could have really scared us, but it just stayed there in the screen. And what's with the disturbing sexual tension between Alice and the Mad Hatter? Obviously there were redeeming qualities, the high points were Helena Bonham Carter as the Queen of Hearts, the only scenes which amused and entertained me, and obviously Depp is great as always, although this definitely wasn't his best performance. I enjoyed the montage of scenes of Alice as a child, that added something that had previously lacked.<br/><br/>But still, at the end I was left thinking 'That's it?' Really disappointed, could have been so great! 5 out of 10."

In Alice in Wonderland, the story based on the Lewis Carroll novel, Alice is not a girl, she's a woman, she's not in Wonderland, she's returning to Wonderland, and Wonderland itself, in fact, isn't Wonderland at all, it's called ""Underland"". UNDERLAND?!? UNDERLA--?! That sounds like a made up world in a Fruit of the Loom commercial! I'm sorry.

Apart from at least giving us what the f*cking title promises, Care Bears in Wonderland, and not Underland, is still mad nonsense where everything is backwards! The villain of the movie wants to bring sense and order to it; that would be a legitimate threat to their world, so the fear in the movie is 100% justified! Here, the queen is just a jerk, but as long as she's as crazy as the rest of them, which she supposedly is, Wonderland- Oh, I'm sorry- Underland shouldn't care! Because, unless you missed what was constantly hammered in, both the story, the book, every interpretation ever made, THEY'RE MAD! THEY'RE ALL F*CKING MAD! So what should they care about any of this crap? And don't get me wrong. Care Bears is an awful movie. It's really bad. They do some stupid s*it, like making the queen nice, a whole bunch of other...crap, but in terms of which one is closer to the spirit of what Alice in Wonderland is?

","Getting Burton to direct this seemed like a good idea at the time, but his vision of Alice doesn't work.<br/><br/>He said that he hated the 1951 animated film, and you can't do a follow up to something you dislike.<br/><br/>Making this film a sort of sequel also confused audiences. Granted Burton wanted it to be that way, due to the amount of hate remakes get. So they decided to go the sequel road. <br/><br/>Everything is dull and grey, the typical Burton look. And everything is all CGI, which looks really fake. Burton explained his hatred for CGI and green screen on the Corpse Bride DVD. And what did he do on this film?<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was the typical weirdo he always plays. Also he character switches between an English accent and a Scottish one. I know it was to add to the madness of the character, but its just so distracting.<br/><br/>Also, there is a scene where Alice drinks pee.<br/><br/>Yeah, when the White Queen (Anne Hathaway doing ANOTHER fairy tale movie!) is making a drink to make Alice bigger (or smaller, I can't remember), she spits in it and pours pee in it. And Alice drinks it. <br/><br/>Yeah, Lewis Carol would be proud. When did this turn into the Farrelly Bros' version of Alice?<br/><br/>Now there were a few things I liked such as Mia as Alice. She's quite sexy. Those sexy shoulders. I think that's the reason why Alice is 19 in this. They wanted a more older, sexier Alice.<br/><br/>It was also really cool to see Alice be a bad ass, although how did she learn how to fight?<br/><br/>I've seen every Burton film, and I have to say this, Planet Of The Apes and Dark Shadows are the weakest of his filmography.<br/><br/>I didn't like the remake of Frankenweenie either."
"secondtake","Null","4","7","18 August 2011"," The Lewis Carroll parts are terrific and the sets and effects mind boggling
","Alice in Wonderland (2010)<br/><br/>Tim Burton is a genius of mise-en-scene, of inventing new worlds and of remembering the joy of innocent imagination. All of that is here, in a movie he directs but based on the so well known and so amazing stories about Alice (Though the Looking Glass, and In Wonderland). The sets and colors and changing realities are amazing stuff, all on their own. If you marvel at the language, that's Lewis Carroll, and it's marvelous. And Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are both superb (Carter surpasses superb, actually) in their leading roles in Wonderland.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong here. It has endless details that make you gasp or laugh or just stare in wonder. It looks good, it has twists of logic, and it's cleverer than clever has a right to be.<br/><br/>There's a feeling sometimes (as with many Burton films) that the effects are the point, and the story gets slightly swamped. And the most main character of all, beyond the writer of course, is Alice herself, played by little known Australian actress Mia Wasikowska (her mother is Polish). Wasikowska is pretty, sweet, and frankly a little dull. In a way this is logical, because she's being swept along and events happen to her, not because of her. Still, she's the star, and I wanted to feel more than curious about her. There is also an action-adventure aspect to this all that seems to pander to the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (or ""Harry Potter""?) sentiment. The good vs. evil battling is at odds with the fanciful rest of it (and not part of the author'<br/><br/>This becomes unbearable by the huge battle scenes which are generic crap, really, and then there is an amazingly odd ending, back in reality, with talk of good old Imperial Britain going at it again. I suppose it is in theory the 19th Century still, but in fact the movie is not, and nor is its audience.<br/><br/>Luckily there is so much else going on all of this hardly matters. Just watching, and watching more, and being in a state of wonder, is quite enough. It's a tour-de-force, a work of originality like you're rarely going to see, as I suppose ""The Wizard of Oz"" must have seemed when it first came out. (Along those lines, imagine if Alice in this film was as charming and sympathetic as Judy Garland.) But really, don't wait, watch this film. It's eye-opening."

Depending on what one liked about the original story, a viewer would either enjoy the new perspective or be incredibly offended.<br/><br/>In the first place, two things are apparent: there are lots of special effects, and there is a lot of screen time for Johnny Depp. The effects are nice enough, in keeping with the level of quality of contemporary movies. It's better than average, although the color design seems drab. Depp doesn't display a good feel for the role, strangely enough. Maybe it's because we've seen too much of him and we can hear a bit of Jack Sparrow here, a trace of Willy Wonka there, but very little Chocolat anywhere. It's another Tim Burton movie for Depp.<br/><br/>The story takes the whimsy of the original and creates a mythology from it. In this way, it becomes another Hollywood effort to turn an older and respected story into a sword and sorcery epic. In this case, the epic doesn't have the juice, since it squeezed all the satire out of the original and used the superficial husk that was left. The familiar whimsical elements are treated too seriously and fail to be entertaining. The story drags on too long and begins to look just like any other special effects movie, complete with roaring monsters, last-minute escapes and a chorus of women singing some unrecognizable words at a climactic moment.<br/><br/>On a personal note, I can't fathom that the filmmakers didn't get the name of the beast - the Jabberwock. It's mentioned several times in the original poem, which they chopped up for no reason. The name of the poem in the original is clearly ""Jabberwocky"" but at no time is that considered to be the name of the beast itself, until this movie. As one of those poor young men who took the time to memorize the poem for his own amusement, I'm personally offended at the carelessness in weaving these components from the original work.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an unworthy contribution to the name of Wonderland. If you never liked Wonderland, you may like this more than I did."

","I admit, when I saw a couple years ago that in 2010 Tim Burton was directing Alice in Wonderland, I was excited. Too excited I suppose. I just kept thinking, why can't this movie come out sooner, 2010 is a long ways away. When it finally did come out I never got a chance to go and see it. Since it came out a few days ago on DVD I have since bought it and watched it many time. If you can look past all the hype the movie received and the high expectations, the movie is not bad at all. It has a good story line that ties in well together and considering the characters did a lot of ""green screen"" the acting is very good. And to all those saying that Tim Burton always uses the same actors, well maybe that is because they play good and believable roles in almost every movie they play in. All I'm saying is, give this movie a chance without thinking about how hyped up everyone got over it."
"jonnyfendi","7","4","7","17 April 2010"," Following The White Rabbit into the Hole?!
","Finally, I went to see ""Alice in Wonderland"", the movie that I had been waiting for such a long time. The tale is about 19-year-old Alice following the white rabbit, to find her destiny back to Wonderland that is now ruled by Red Queen. The movie is directed by Tim Burton, the man who specializes in eye candy and delight visualization. Thiz movie is the seventh collaboration with Johnny Depp as his main performer, after ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), ""Ed Wood"" (1994), ""Sleepy Hollow"" (1999), ""Charlie and The Chocolate Factory"" (2005), ""Corpse Bride"" (2005) and ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" (2007). His other masterpiece features are ""Beetle Juice"" (1988), ""Batman"" (1989) and ""Big Fish"" (2003). Thiz movie is supported by various Cast members like Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Michael Sheen, Alan Rickman and Mia Wasikowska as Alice. The most powerful performance in thiz movie is ""Big Head"" Red Queen character, which is played amazingly wicked and funny at the same time by Helena Bonham Carter (it's about the same character on Lord Farquaad in first ""Shrek"" {2001}). Bonham Carter's performance exceeds Depp's appearance. Her existence saves the movie for overall. Beside that I do not feel any emotions on thiz film, everything is flat. Actually, thiz movie isn't supported by a good script. It could be the worst script that ever came to Tim Burton's desk in these past twenty years of his career. Nevertheless, the visualization is A-Class. The story is an alternate version of the original ""Alice in Wonderland"" (written by Lewis Caroll). Thiz version doesn't carry such a thrill and interesting plots. At the final scene (Spoiler Alert!), give Alice a sword and knight armor to slay a dragon? It's definitely not a good option. The change is too radical, soft and tender Alice that is built from the beginning suddenly takes an incisive turn over. The flip over is so hard that possibly has become its own boomerang itself.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

","This is a film I had been highly expecting, because I knew Burton would have the visual talent necessary to make this film believable. But, as the release date drew nearer, it seemed the storyline did not suit the visual kudos.<br/><br/>After seeing it, I can tell you that, even though several scenes are a bit incongruous in a Tim Burton movie, he did his best to deal with the script, which was basically a retelling of the story with a heroic fantasy premise, and make it an engrossing experience. <br/><br/>I ended up actually caring for the characters, Helena Bonham Carter being my favourite cast member here, and this Wonderland comes true anyway, at least as far as visuals go. Even though the story felt like a bizarre interpretation of Lewis Caroll's original masterpiece, it did blend into the scenes and all the material taken from the books, making it feel less irrelevant, and adding a fresh touch to Burton's own magnificent visual creation."
"rubyy","8","4","7","14 April 2010"," Who needs expectations when you've got Tim Burton?
","I will admit, this film was far away from my expectations. I will also admit, this is not necessarily a negative thing.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland 2010 is yet another combination of three fantastic people; Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter - three beautiful, creative, clever, imaginative and fantastic people who have created many things most people would not even come across thinking. However, the thoughts that immediately cross my mind when I think of Alice in Wonderland - a little girl, a beautiful world, craziness, colours, lots of colours. In this Alice in Wonderland? Not so much.<br/><br/>Tim Burton adapted Alice and he adapted the wonderland. He adapted them to his crazy chaotic mind, to create something new, something wild, something.. well, fantastic really. A certain simple grimness went with the movie, which you will understand when you watch it. But it is something to embrace rather than shy away from. I have heard from too many people that the film was 'not up to expectations'. But why do you need expectations when you've got Tim Burton as a director? As for Johnny Depp - as always, he came up trumps as the Mad Hatter. Some could say that his role showed a little too much likeness to Willy Wonka in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory 2005. However, I beg to differ. Willy Wonka and Mad Hatter share many characteristics. They are both wild, wacky, and...well...wonderful people. Therefore, I believe Tim Burton and Johnny Depp knew what they were doing with the hint of Willy Wonka, not forgetting the hint of Johnny himself.. and it is perfect. Johnny is perfect, as usual. The film also includes actors you may know of such as Helena Bonham-Carter, Anne Hathaway, Barbara Windsor and Stephen Fry, plus many more. The casting, in my opinion, is perfectly done. Although I will admit the storyline could have been more complex and less predictable, the wonderful acting and 3D graphics help to steer you away from this point. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a life changing, thought provoking storyline, this film is not where you will find one. If you are looking for a magical, fun family adventure and a beautiful experience, it is.<br/><br/>Oh, and stay for the credits. I think they're beautiful. You'll see what I mean."

The acting is spot on, all of the voice acting is superb and by some of the best in the industry. But above all else the story is captivating and leaves you truly thinking what motivates you in life and I know after seeing this film I will wake up in the morning and think of six impossible things before breakfast, because what can we do but take the impossible and make is possible just as Alice did with her adversity."

","I've reviewed Tim Burton's ""Alice"" at Trilllogic Innoventions. I am only here to speak in the name of fairness, which seems very lacking in cyberspace these days, as well as in the real world. I see too many artful works such as this ripped to shreds by those who love to bash. I read spiteful remarks hurled at actresses and actors, directors, screenwriters by individuals hiding behind aliases. Everyone's entitled to their opinions. That doesn't make it right to vent your frustrations at others simply because you can. I have never been afraid to stand alone on a field of battle and raise my vorpal pen against an army of naysayers. Fans of mindless Action will probably not appreciate this film. They will probably not be satisfied until 3-D technology advances to the point of reaching from the screen and actually clobbering them over the head. Those looking for dramatic emotional depth or sidesplitting belly laughs may be disappointed. It isn't about that and never was. A true fan of Lewis Carroll will appreciate this light yet intricate romp as a splendiferous tribute. Somebody unfamiliar with Wonderland should marvel at it too. Those expecting to be clobbered, keep waiting. I'm sure your day will come."

","Having read many of the derogatory revues prior to seeing this film I was braced for disappointment. So what a pleasure it was to be taken by surprise and find myself totally absorbed in this clever and magical new trip into Wonderland. For me, the whole film throbbed with energy, vibrant imagery and above all, fun. The new 'slant' on an old story was, I felt, handled imaginatively and with a pleasing freshness.<br/><br/>My wife and I went to see Avitar a couple of weeks ago and both considered that without the 3D effects it would have been a very ordinary film with minimal charm, just one more in a succession of computer generated movies. Not so Alice which for me had charm in spades, a far superior storyline and enough of the characteristics of the original story to satisfy my appetite for traditionalism. It also retained a true sense of 'Englishness' which was another nice surprise in a world where that has so often been lost. The effects were great and I take my hat off to all the cast who more than did justice to their parts. Maybe not the greatest movie ever made but certainly a visual feast with never a dull moment but, perhaps most importantly...it was a lot of fun. Thank you Tim Burton, WE REALLY ENJOYED IT!"
"angelbythecoast","9","4","7","18 March 2010"," It's a movie people, get real!
","I have read multiple reviews hacking up Tim Burton's vision of Alice in Wonderland, and I just have to laugh. It's a movie. It's one director's vision. It's perfectly charming. It's a different take on the original story. COME ON people... I can't help but read some of the reviews filled with hyperbole and flash and crack up to myself over these people writing in who deem themselves as legitimate film critics.<br/><br/>It is a delightful bit of fancy if you are willing to embrace the ""suspension of all disbelief"" thought process.

","Without spewing the same remarks as the few reviews I glossed over, let me skip straight past the plot and on to the finer fare- the actual decision if it's good or not.<br/><br/>The answer, in short, is that it's great but only if you're absolutely obsessed with the two original books. This film, start to finish is nothing short of a love letter (thus the title of this review) from Burton to Lewis Carroll. It lovingly tweaks and twists at all the classic characters, summoning the Jabberwock (or as it's incorrectly known here, the Jabberwocky) but not forgetting the Jubjub bird or the frumious Bandersnatch. The only casting choice I find myself disliking is the infamous Depp as the Hatter. I actually think a relatively small- time actor would have lent himself to the role far better.<br/><br/>The visuals are superb, with the always... eerie Cheshire Cat hitting a perfect blend between guide and traitor. Furthermore, the slight explanation of Cheshire Cat's ability to disappear is a nice touch to bring some reality to an otherwise extremely odd world."

","I'd think twice before you get your child excited about a new ""Alice in Wonderland"" movie with the same White Rabbit, the same mad tea party, the same grinning Cheshire Cat and the same bad-tempered Queen of Hearts they've grown to love. Although these same characters are in this 2010 version, there is a major twist and, to young children, it is not a very friendly one! Instead of the 9/10-year-old little girl we all know, Alice is almost as old as me (however, like me, she's in her second childhood). Surely, youngsters won't want to see Alice severely injured by one of the more fierce ""Wonderland"" characters and this is just one of a series of scenes that would be considered more suitable for more mature people. I saw this movie in 3D this afternoon with my family and we all enjoyed it. Tim Burton has obviously tried his best to retain the world-famous catchphrases and musical poems from the classic book by Lewis Carroll but possibly couldn't resist putting so much of his quirky self into it. Everything is so dramatic in this film; I'm 20 and I found one or two bits scary. I would certify this film a 12A, at least, rather than the given PG classification."
"red_jacket0707","3","7","15","11 March 2010"," It's official: The Burton/Depp money making machine has broken!
","Once upon a time, Tim Burton could do no wrong with his quirky, Gothic styled, Jonny Depp led (usually) films.<br/><br/>Sometimes, a winning formula should know when to quit before it goes stale.<br/><br/>*short summary* - Alice falls down a rabbit hole and finds herself in a place much like the dreams she used to have. The inhabitants of the so called ""Underland"" have been expecting Alice, as it was foretold that she would overthrow the evil red queen by defeating the Jaberwocky.<br/><br/>The problem with this? It had no soul. It was almost as if Burton was going through the motions. ""moody sequence here, tragic young porcelain girl looks forlorn there, cue Jonny Depp being weird."" I was incredibly bored with everything going on. It did not hold me one bit.<br/><br/>Depp was poor. he tried this strange split personality thing with him half speaking in a Scottish accent, but it just didn't work at all. It was very confusing, and not in the ""but it is supposed to be"" way. Depp needs to think ""inside the box"" for his next role. It's getting tiresome. I thought he was bad as Willy Wonka! The tweedles were underused, and the respective queens were both annoying. I'd rather none of them be in charge! Good points? It looks quite nice. there are some laughs, although not nearly enough! Alice is quite a good actress in the making i guess.<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD, and if you've ever seen a 3D movie, this adds nothing new.<br/><br/>This is a Disney money maker I'm afraid. nothing new to see.

","These days lets face it, when it comes to films like these with all the technology and money behind it we expect stunning visuals, But thats it, thats where it ended with this film. Stunning Visuals weak story, i always remember The characters from the world of the wonderland to be a mystery not something you can write down on paper and understand that was the Great part of the characters! the sense of the Unknown, but this film has brought them back down to earth with a gigantic thud!!! and given them morales to boot, made them less of a mystery and more understandable. What about the Plot, why o why???? Alice gets pulled back into the world to help rid it of the evil queen of hearts?? why?? she's part of that world! part of what it is! and if i remember correctly she wasn't exactly a mother Teresa last time she was there!!, oh!!!...she has to kill a dragon...thing...with a sword that seems to have no powers and has no connection with Alice so i don't know why she needs to do it!! and she needs to kill it so people wont be scared of the evil queen, which again doesn't make sense because she never uses the dragon for anything in the film anyway...but there ya go... the Cheshire Cat appears whenever as you expect, and moves things with his invisibility power...which is where the plot is flawed, the Cheshire cat can go invisible, get the key, unlock the box which has the sword and chop the dragons head off without anyone knowing and the mad hatter can be back in time for tea!!! end of film, but no! that would be to obvious.<br/><br/>So Alice was dragged back to wonderland which she couldn't remember who or what things were (even though she had been there before and dreamt about it for 13 years) and the characters decided that they would get Alice to do there Dirty work..in a nutshell.

"Doe_nutty","5","8","18","6 March 2010"," Squandered Potential
","When I heard about this film I was thrilled, not least because I am a Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fan, but also because I loved Alice in Wonderland. I thought there was such potential for the film but after seeing it yesterday I have to admit I am disappointed. The potential - a film with limits that cannot be defined, crazy is whatever is outside of normal perception. The previous collaborations have been films where the abnormal or extraordinary have been rendered normal or ordinary by the viewing of a film in which the oddities are perceived as regular. You still retain the sense of wonder at the same time as the shock of something outside your general sphere of understanding. Alice however wanted to be something so badly, and it could have been. However it wasn't. I think that maybe not including older characters as well as new characters could have helped, how can you fit that many important character developments into a (just under) two hour film? And the truth is they couldn't and didn't. Personally I didn't feel attached to anyone. Alice was unemotional and considering she thought it was dream was extremely reluctant to even crack a smile at the madness, the dormouse was bizarre fluff, turning up at important moments with no real input, the caterpillar, great in character but really pointless, the Hatter, switching between sane and insane when the scene suited, the red and white queens both flimsy and with completely futile actions. At least in Narnia we knew why the children were there to save the land, here I have no idea why. Neither character was properly developed or given a plot line to react to. They were both acting their characters. And yes, Helena Bonham Carter was very good, but I didn't see any relation to anything really. The White Queen was a thankless and pointless part, why was she the best choice? Why couldn't she fight for her own land? There may have been very good reasons but this wasn't cleared up in the film and made her seem fairly vapid and needless. If they had been more honest to the telling of the film then the 'champion' i.e Alice would have been crowned ruler of the land. I had hope for the film and its not terrible if it were the normal film put out there by the big studios for a blockbuster. But I had hope in the actors and the director and the previous films they had produced. I left the cinema confused and just wishing there had been a little more 'muchness' which they accused Alice of losing - well this film lost what they had. Shame."

Since there was so much hype about this movie, I had high expectations, and Alice in Wonderland met my expectations and more. I was completely absorbed by the movie the entire time; the plot was never boring or confusing and built up to an extremely satisfying ending. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter did an exceptional job, of course. Not only was the acting convincing and the plot exciting, the effects were unbelievable. It wasn't a sensory overload and never was too much to take in at once; it was perfectly balanced and I could almost taste, smell, and feel the setting. Overall, another excellent film by Tim Burton. I highly recommend seeing this movie, and in 3D if you can. I was highly impressed."
"baba44713","4","5","10","11 March 2010"," Mr. Burton... what happened?
","When I first read Burton is doing his own version of Alice in Wonderland, I thought that this is a match made in heaven. Insanity of Tim Burton coupled with inherent insanity of Alice's story meant that things just couldn't go wrong..especially since it was a given that Depp and Bonham-Carter must be in it, too.<br/><br/>Well, something did go wrong. And it's a little bit hard to simply point out what.<br/><br/>I might just as well start with the story. I never thought I would say something like this about a Burton movie but it was too.. well, normal. I always thought that one of the biggest virtues of ""Alice in Wonderland"" was how it subtly yet efficiently tapped into one's primal fear of not being able to trust his/her own senses and of losing one's mind. Once Alice drops down into the rabbit hole she gets dislodged from reality, things stop making sense, there's nothing to hold on to, no referential point to start from, no friends by her side to have for comfort and aid. Nearly everything that happens to the (original) Alice feels random and disjointed, every situation is weird and almost every character is inconsistent - sometimes they are friendly, sometimes hostile, sometimes indifferent, but almost always utterly insane. Alice's story is wonderful, yet profoundly disturbing.<br/><br/>Burton's Alice in comparison is rather tame. For some reason he opted for a different, grown-up Alice, who essentially revisits Wonderland not to come to terms with growing up, but rather rebel against an arranged marriage and norms being forced upon her. And this is where most of the problems lie. What we have here is a weird mesh-up of the old, familiar Alice story and the oh-so-clichÃ© prophetical-hero-saves-the-land-from-evil plot we have seen so many times already. The sense of discovery is gone, but what's worse that sense of disorientation and overall insanity is almost completely subdued. Characters Alice meets are pretty well known by everyone, but this time around they are almost without exception friendly and helpful, some even getting very obviously romantically interested in Alice. She herself is mostly neither scared nor surprised, almost throughout the entire movie she blatantly accepts everything around her simply by repeating that it's all a dream. I don't know if it's a matter of bad casting, bad directing, or was done completely on purpose to further reinforce the fact that this Alice is now much more mature and down-to-earth, but if Alice essentially does not care about strange things around her, why should we? <br/><br/>There's very little Burton has to offer in his version of Alice. Nothing new or Burtonesque or even very interesting happens; it's like reading the very same, familiar story but with some other artist doing the illustrations.<br/><br/>Things are somewhat saved by excellent performances of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter. Depp's version of Mad Hatter is joy to behold to people who like to pay attention to tiny details; his accent shifts constantly, and so does his personality, and some of these shifts are often rather subtle. But even though watching someone who knows how to act doing what he does best is pretty enjoyable, this Mad Hatter still isn't, well, Mad Hatter. The character of Mad Hatter should above all be... mad. Insane. Unpredictable. This one is at best mildly eccentric, but also noble and rather lovable. In fact, this could be said for almost every character in Burton's Alice - they are not insane, they just act a bit strangely, and not by much. And they all have a good heart. I know this is a Disney movie and everything, but come on - even in the cartoon the characters were very true to those from the original book, why are they now so consistently friendly and loyal to Alice? Where's the fun in that?<br/><br/>Bonham-Carter's Red Queen is spot-on, on the other hand. It's hard not to have flashes of Miranda Richardson's Queen Elizabeth from Black Adder (the character which was, after all, based on the Red Queen, and let's not forget Miranda later actually played the Red Queen in Hallmark's version of Alice, and she played it rather close to her earlier role), but still, Helen's Red Queen is a rather welcome comic relief. Her interpretation of ""Off with his/her head!"" never gets old, and what should be an irritating and whiny character somehow ends up being a fresh sight in an otherwise rather pedestrian movie.<br/><br/>White Queen - played by Anne Hathaway - is a bit hammy and over-the-top, which I guess was the point, but it failed to work on many levels. She does get some funny moments though.<br/><br/>I must mention the all 3D thing, too. It simply does not work. In Avatar it was great, but it wasn't merely because of better technology; it was also the fact that Avatar is a bright, colorful movie, and since 3D essentially darkens the screen somewhat, the experience is not diminished. Burton's Alice is often dark and gloomy (we are talking about Burton, after all), and when you put on your 3D glasses the movie simply becomes too dark, like you are watching it with sunglasses on. It really puts a dent on your viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>So - ""Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland 3D"". In my opinion, at best this is a mildly enjoyable movie which will be somewhat appreciated by fans of Depp/Burton/Carter, at worst it's a boringish, pedestrian and rather underwhelming experience. Bottom line, it just isn't Alice. Tim Burton somehow missed the point, and let's hope that what he has in store for us will surpass this entry by far.<br/><br/>4/10"

It has no hint of darkness or chilling imagery, exactly what you would expect from an Alice film & much more a Tim Burton Alice film. Burton had such great potential for a great Alice flick, but he fails miserably here with a predictable 'girl power' plot, lame fight scenes & too much mad hatter. Sorry Tim but peppering a bad story with cool characters is not gonna make a good movie. & the mad hatter & Alice are allies!! How stupid is that! The jabberwocky fight scene was super lame. He didn't even put up a fight, & he wasn't scary looking at all & he was easily defeated. This movie was bright & cheery, not dark at all. How dare Tim Burton mess with such a classic. This movie should have been called Alice returns to Wonderland or better yet, The Adventures of Alice & the Hatter. This movie is a combination of both Lewis Carrol books & doesn't even include the disturbing walrus and the carpenter story & is more of a sequel of sorts. This movie is truly disappointing, you're better off renting it."

","I sat through the movie and dozed off a couple of times. When it finished, I found I was not the only one and the kids behind me gave a moderate OK to the movie. I usually enjoy watching kids movies. Compared with other kids movies, this one failed pathetically.<br/><br/>The story of Alice in Wonderland is well known. A little innocent girl lost in wonderland and experiences all sorts of wonderful magic. That was what made the story so popular to families and children.<br/><br/>What we have here is however, a grown-up Alice who has out-grown her naivete, in the middle of a personal crisis and fallen through a rabbit hole into Wonderland. She is not curious about anything anymore and just wants to get out of there. Nothing thrown at her surprises her. She just deals with it because she has to. There also lacks a story line to stitch the events together. She just bumps into things and people one after another. The dialog was also poorly constructed and boring. The wonderful computerized animations did little to excite the audience (not quite possible anymore after Avatar). <br/><br/>The whole production feels like the retiring Wonderland staff making a last ditch of effort before it closes down.

After Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, I knew I was in for a screwed up script, but wow.... it was worse than I thought! The visuals were good but that's all that stood out in the movie, the screen play felt like it was written over night, and was cold. If you thought Charlie And The Chocolate Factory was heartless, this movie was even worse and disappointed me even on my low expectations. <br/><br/>-I was disappointed in the score too, I listened to the soundtrack and none of it's awesome music was in the movie except for back ground music for scenes. I expected to see an opening credits with Elfman theme and another magical piece of music at the end, but not only were there no opening credits, the end credit song wasn't even Elfman, it was some other song which I was disappointed. I didn't know I had to wait for that song to be over to hear Alice's Theme so I missed it.<br/><br/>-The beginning with Alice and the proposal is okay, I felt like they were trying to create a wonderland and real life connection but in the end of the film Alice learns that she's different from society and shouldn't be bossed around and forced to marry. That's all okay. <br/><br/>-When Alice first comes to wonderland we hear of the Red Queen taking over wonderland and that Alice needs to defeat the Jabberwocky. So at that point I already knew that in the end Alice would defeat the jabberwocky, and they didn't even make an effort to at least play with the audience a little on that point. <br/><br/>-When ever there wasn't an action scene it was Alice convincing herself that she's is not the right Alice and that it is all a dream.... that's week, do they really think we're going to be surprised that it's not a dream? <br/><br/>-Alice was a boring character, and Mia's performance is almost razzie worthy. Throughout the entire movie she only has about too expressions and always speaks in the same monotone. The mad hatter was okay, the mouse was okay, the only characters that were really had interesting and likable personality was the Red Queen. In fact, the Red queen was so too likable, enough that I really felt sorry for her with the battle and how Stayne tried to kill her, I don't get how she's evil. I thought I was suppose to hate the villain for it being evil and look forward to it's defeat, but no not with her. On top of that, I could not stand Anne's over acting for the Whit Queen, I wanted her to die in the battle. <br/><br/>-The whole plot of the story is just dull and boring, the entire premise is: <br/><br/>Alice grows up and returns to wonderland and needs to defeat the jabberwocky because a magic piece of toilet paper says she does, she goes through Wonderland in a bunch of action scenes thinking it's all a dream. Through the actions scenes, we learn important plot points about the past, such as how the Red Queen had taken over wonderland and some back ground on the Red Queen, but it doesn't save the film or add up in a strong way. mostly because it's rushed. <br/><br/>-There is nothing in the movie that is gripping at the least, or anything that makes me want to seat to wait for the end, I knew Alice would realize it's a dream, I knew she will defeat the jabberwocky, I knew the red queen will be defeated and I knew that red queen has taken over wonderland. There's nothing that gets my interest, by halfway through the movie I was finding myself yawning waiting for it to be over. I didn't care for the plot, why would anyone? The awesome special effects couldn't save the film, after a while I started to wish I saw it in 3D. <br/><br/>There, I have proved you wrong, the movie gets negative reviews and hate because it's not a very good film. True a lot of people like to be trolls and slam Tim for the fun of it, but I'm not like that. I judge a film by it's quality, not by it's box office, director or cast. Now having that review posted, it's your turn. Give me a specific review on how this film is good, if you can't than you are the one with vague reviews on the mater."
"Simon_Says_Movies","5","6","13","17 March 2010"," Ironically wonder-less
","A sense of wonder is something which director Tim Burton is no stranger, in fact few creative minds in movies today have had such an impressive run the with the bizarre and darkly whimsical. Perhaps then it is irony at play, as Burton's rendition of the classic novel is one his blandest efforts yet.<br/><br/>To Burton's credit, as he did quite well with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory he introduces an interesting back story for Alice which frames her adventures in Wonderland. In this version, Alice is a twenty year old girl who, according to the many creatures of the underworld, visited when she was a little girl (an experience of which she has no recollection). Attending an aristocratic get-together with her family and the wealthy elite, Alice is expected to accept the proposal of a young man. Moments after his proposal however, she is off chasing that devious white rabbit and the adventure begins.<br/><br/>Burton himself confessed to finding previous adaptations of the novel to be too episodic, with no clearly defined narrative and here he wanted to correct that. Somewhere in that quest however, this version has emerged more pointless and rambling than ever before; there are neither real revelations about Alice's previous experiences nor any real sense of destiny to compel the audience. There is simply the introduction of quirky or bizarre characters/creatures, one after the other and it all grows tiresome fast. <br/><br/>Alice is played by young Australian actress Mia Wasikowska and she is by all standards, good. But left and right she is upstaged both by larger than life characters and the visually dazzling sets. She plays Alice with the proper spirit to be certain but she becomes utterly forgettable amongst the clutter. The real standouts are Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and even more so, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. Despite her bulbous head, she gives not only the best performance overall, but also the best villainous performance. (A difficult feat when you look like a Pez dispenser) As I said, Depp is great as the Hatter, and I actually wish he had showed up sooner, because the story is even duller before his arrival. One thing I will say is his whispering lisp seems to give way to a bizarre Scottish accent when he raises its voice. But perhaps bizarre is not exactly out of place in this film.<br/><br/>What I would call my favourite part of the film is Burton's vision of the Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), who I found to be mesmerizing. Also in the stellar voice line-up is Ala Rickman as the blue caterpillar, Matt Lucas as an excellent Tweedledee and Tweedledum and Michael Sheen as the white rabbit. Alas, even with such wonderful actors preset they only, at best, manage to upstage Alice. Alice in Wonderland which is in 3-D, was not originally conceived as such but was later converted. I am shocked. Alice has more in-your-face, things- flying-at-the-screen, gotcha moments than most 3-D films in conception. I do admire what was attempted here, but vision does not always equate to quality and when all is thrown down the rabbit hole, Alice in Wonderland is simply a mess.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

","Tim Burton should be ashamed of himself making such a horrible movie. Johnny Depp should have read the script before committing to this movie. The visuals were outstanding (thats why i gave it a 2)but not enough to save the movie. The story is terrible you don't care about any of the characters, there is no climax to the movie and at the end you really don't care who wins the good or the evil! Do not spend money at the theater for this movie, maybe a rental but i cant even recommend that. This is one of those movies where the visuals are great and the acting is good but the action and the story are so poorly done that you just don't care what happens. If you like visually appealing movies then check out Avatar because that has a great story and good visuals."
"eternal_bluesck29-1","5","6","13","7 March 2010"," An Alice for everyone = A pretty, but lazy, muddled mess
","Perhaps I walked into this with unfair expectations. I love Tim Burton and his unique and artistic visual flair. And Alice in Wonderland has been an obsession of mine since I was a kid. I wanted this to be amazing, but I what it is is a generic fantasy adventure hiding behind some familiar faces in fancy new clothes (I must admit, the costumes are incredible).<br/><br/>I can't deny that the film is visually stunning, though I personally loathe the heavy reliance on CGI in movies today. (Go watch Return to Oz or Little Shop of Horrors or Labyrinth to see how much more real a fantasy world can look with an amazing set and cleverly designed puppets.) While this post-apocalyptic ""Underland"" is beautiful to behold (the moat of severed heads was particularly cool), the world feels hollow and distanced.<br/><br/>The plot... oy. It's serviceable. You've heard it before: Willfull Teenager travels to another world which has been driven to ruin by a tyrannical ruler. Willfull Teenager connects with a ragtag band to overthrow said ruler and save the world. It's a generic fantasy plot with the Wonderland gang thrown into the parts where they most conveniently fit. This is the most disappointing aspect of the film, in my opinion. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are hard books to turn into a cohesive movie plot, the books are essentially plot-less. But they're filled with so many iconic images, that when you're prepared to take as many liberties as this film does, it makes you wonder why would you squander all that potential on a story that any Joe off the street could have written? <br/><br/>As far as performances go, the film fares pretty well. Johnny Depp is a fine Mad Hatter, though at times, he gets so frantic I can hardly even make out what he's even saying. Helena Bonham Carter is without a doubt the best Queen of Hearts (going by the Red Queen in this version) in any Wonderland adaptation. She captured the selfishness and immaturity perfectly. And the voice actors are all decent. But any trip to Wonderland hinges on its Alice, and unfortunately, Mia Wasikowska pretty much sleepwalks through the film. Critics seem to take issue with how she plays Alice as being annoyed to be in such a wonder-full land. However, if you read the books, you would see that Alice IS annoyed to be in Wonderland. How could she not? She's surrounded by conceited lunatics the whole time. But I take issue with Wasikowska not being annoyed ENOUGH. Or displaying any sense of emotion enough. Such a subtle, and subdued performance doesn't really carry this kind of movie.<br/><br/>There is also an issue with the pacing of the film. It's pretty light-speed, which is a shame because that means it doesn't take time to savor the things that they could have explored more thoroughly to create a richer, more unique experience. The relationship between the Red Queen and White Queen for one. As well as the Knave of Hearts' relationship with the Red Queen. The Knave and the White Queen, I would argue, are the most intriguing characters in the film. Anne Hathaway certainly plays the White Queen as though her motives aren't entirely altruistic. But who cares about that when there's a ferocious dragon - or Jabberwocky - for Alice to slay for no reason? Alice herself is a good character, but any scenes to explore her growth as a person last about two minutes and are expressed in lines copy and pasted from everything Belle or Mulan or Princess Jasmine ever said.<br/><br/>Now, this movie is clearly meant to appeal to everyone, kids included. And kids aren't going to want to sit through a talky introspective art-house film, true. But Pixar proves time and again that you can have unique plots and characters that appeal to the masses. It can be done. But hey, Taylor Swift is winning grammys now, ushering in an era of mediocrity as far as the entertainment industry goes. And Alice in Wonderland seems to just be another example of the industry getting lazier and greedier. I'm thrilled that a new generation can get excited about what I think is the best piece of literature out there, but it's a shame it needs dumbing down and simplifying to do it."
"ragstorichesfan","10","6","13","6 March 2010"," An In depth look
","Sitting in the theatre Friday I had prepared for the worst.I had allowed myself to have such high expectations their was no way that even Tim Burton could have meet them. I enjoy Burton's Films mainly because to me they are like curling up with a twisted children's book like Mary Poppins or The wonderful Wizard of Oz.His movies I describe as a living piece of art ripped from the very pages and brought to life deliciously. of these type of tales. Don't believe me? go borrow some of these books from your local library.When Burton does do a movie from a published source he tends to choose only the key elements of the story to bring to life, he mixes it with his own vision of the story and come up with an acceptable take.For Instance Sleepy Hollow. a few alterations and out of it came a deliciously dark tale that was visually stunning and well plotted.Story changing doesn't bother me so much, In fact I feel that if a movie is good enough it will encourage viewers to actually go find the book and read it. In this day in age that's an impressive feat. The lights darkened and the film started and I was once again swept away to Wonderland. The story was solid, well put together and well acted. The story takes an unsure 19 year old woman who after a fanciful journey learns to take control of her own life and to stand up for what she believes in during a period when women didn't have control. Each battle she overcomes in Wonderland is one she had within herself.I think a lot of people are missing that, which makes no sense to me since this story has been told 100's of time over the past century.As Alice goes through Wonderland Tim makes sure that all the key points from both of Lewis Carroll's books are in place. He introduces the characters to Alice who is clearly on a return visit.The colorful array of characters go from the Mad Hatter and the March hare to the Catepilar and Cheshire cat. All the familiars as well as some of the lesser known characters of the White Queen and the Jabborwocki. I was so afraid that Alice In Wonderland would only be about the Mad Hatter, just because of the Depp Factor, but fortunatly Tim remembered the movie was about Alice and her coming of age story.Johnny Depp does exceedingly well in this role compared to the gay pirate routine or the border line pedophile Willy Wonka. The Mad Hatter has depth despite his madness. Anne Hathaway does a brilliant job as the air headed white queen.. a relief from the 1985 mini series depiction of the same character. The Tweedles are awesome' and the Cheshire cat you want to take home with you.Tim's Wife even outdoes herself as the Red Queen. Delightful. Visually is everything you ever wanted Wonderland to be. I do believe that Tim Burton has not used castles in his films since Faerie Tale Theatre's Aladdin.Both Castles are directly from your imagination. Anything and Everything you could want out of an alice in wonderland movie is here and present. now the 3d aspect, not a necessity for enjoyment but definitely icing on the cake. The movie will hold its own in 2-d. Leaving the theatre I felt like it was money worth spent. I went to the theatre to see a work of art tribute for a 100 year old classic done by a very talented director. I got what I hoped for. A good solid story, great acting, stunning visuals and most importantly a desire to see it again.Your enjoyment of the film does depend on your outlook i suppose and what you hope to see. I hope the experience is as equally wonderful for you as it was for me."

","""You're absolutely Alice, I'd know you anywhere."" <br/><br/>Whether you love him or hate him, you have to admit Tim Burton is a visual genius. His films always have enough wild artistic imagination to keep audiences satisfied, and sometimes he can actually tell a decent story when he puts his mind to it. It wasn't a surprise when it was announced he would tackle Alice In Wonderland because the project always had his name written all over it. Now that it has finally arrived, audiences are eager to drift away into another world and leave reality behind them. Does Burton's latest effort give audiences the wild ride they are expecting? <br/><br/>Absolutely.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland is an incredible work of art that captures you from the first second the film starts until the very second the credits end. Once you enter the theater, you surrender yourself to Burton's fantasy universe. If you're fortunate enough to see the film in IMAX 3-D, you'll be blown away by the expansive presentation and depth the film gives to the viewer. This is one of the best IMAX 3-D presentations I've come across in a long time. The film uses up the entire IMAX screen throughout the course of the presentation, so we're not subject to the 'switching' of aspect ratios during the movie. The images are crystal clear and sometimes feel like they're right in front of you. The audio was just mind-blowing and it really presented the soundtrack well, especially since some of the music in this film is incredibly well done. Trust me, it never disappoints. Now, if you're seeing the film in a conventional theater in Digital 3-D, you should still have a great time. Hell, even if you saw it without the 3-D, the visuals are sure to take your breathe away. You'll forget your in the movie theater, and you'll feel as if you're along with Alice for the ride.<br/><br/>Don't worry though: the visuals aren't the only good thing about this film. The performances are spot on. Johnny Depp was perfectly cast as the Mad Hatter. His performance should stick with audiences for quite some time. Depp brings such a wide emotional range to the character that audiences will surely feel his humor, sadness, happiness, and his down right creepy chaotic state of mind. Mia Wasikowska was also perfectly cast as Alice. Burton made the right move by choosing someone who isn't insanely popular, but talented enough to bring the innocence of Alice to life. Wasikowska does an incredible job of developing the character from an unsure depressed teen, to a confident and optimistic adult. Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway also did a great job playing the Red Queen and White Queen respectively. Even Alan Rickman does a great job with his brief cameo appearances as the Caterpillar.<br/><br/>Now, while the film was insanely fun and felt like a genuine adventure, it does have one flaw worth noting. This flaw, which may not come as a surprise to many, is the story line. I was optimistic with the story, especially since this film focuses on Alice's return to Wonderland. But something about it was just off. It was a little corny at times and at other moments it wasn't completely coherent. The story also doesn't do justice to Carter's Red Queen character: she's so viciously evil, yet her main opponent is just her sister, The White Queen, who lives on the opposite side of a huge valley. By the third act, you go back and fourth between these two castles so much that you feel you want to explore other parts of Wonderland, but you don't get to. I feel as if they should have abandoned The White Queen, and just focused on rebelling against the sinister Red Queen. Finally, the story suggests everything is destined in some way...which doesn't leave much for the imagination.<br/><br/>The overall product, however, was great. Without a doubt, audiences will have a fun time being sucked into Burton's twisted world. As movie-goers, we always ask for a film that will take us on a crazy adventure, and this film does just that. Even though there are some weak plot points, the film does such an incredible job of capturing the viewer that you can forgive Burton for his poor story choices. For the last two hours I was in Wonderland with Alice, meeting some crazy-ass characters. By the time I got out of the theater, I forgot it was 2:00 AM in the morning. When I drove away from the IMAX cinema, I wanted nothing more than to jump down the rabbit hole for a second run."

","Why-Oh-Why did Director Tim Burton have to go and get his grubby, little (Edward Scissor) hands on the story of Alice In Wonderland? <br/><br/>The way I see it, Burton almost single-handedly succeeded in totally trashing this unique and unusual fairy tale by turning it into yet another one of his typically terrible, little freak shows.<br/><br/>Unlike the 1951 animated version of this same story, where the characters were basically charming, likable and memorable, Burton's offering gives us characters that are really quite the opposite.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Burton's remaking of Alice In Wonderland is about the same thing as if Rob Zombie were to go ahead and remake Burton's ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"", or something to that effect.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is another reason for my disliking Alice In Wonderland. Am I the only one who's sick to death of seeing this guy in yet another Burton film? <br/><br/>I admit that Depp is a decent enough actor, in a generic sort of way, but the truth is, he is far too over-rated for my liking.

And although I do not always like Burton's surrealistic style, I surely enjoyed this movie and not only the visual aspect (which is superb). And although this story is different from the original story and its sequel (Alice through the looking glass) there are many references to these stories including almost all of the original characters. Especially Johnny Depp is really great as the Mad Hatter. And although the story is not by any means new, elaborate or refreshing it is fantasy just the way I like it to be with colorful characters. Not a masterpiece but a movie I would give a view every once in a while. I really loved it."
"Buddy-51","8","3","5","24 March 2011"," a cornucopia of visual delights
","Given his flair for the whimsical, the surrealistic, and the preposterous, Tim Burton would seem the ideal choice to direct a modern movie version of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."" And turns out he is. (Terry Gilliam and Guillermo del Toro, whose ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was already a variant of sorts on the story, are two others who might have done as well).<br/><br/>Lewis Carroll's darkly humorous Victorian Era classic chronicles the adventures of a spunky, imaginative young girl who tumbles down a rabbit hole into a fantastic world of talking animals, size-altering potions, and memorably eccentric characters, a land ruled over by the evil, bulbous-headed Red Queen, played with petulant haughtiness by Helena Bonham Carter. The screenplay for the film – now called simply ""Alice in Wonderland"" - by Linda Woolverton draws from both ""Wonderland"" and its first sequel ""Through the Looking Glass"" (as most previous film versions have done), and captures both the darkness and the humor of the material.<br/><br/>All of Carroll's beloved creations are here, some played by actors in costumes and makeup, some generated entirely through CGI, and some – like The Red Queen – produced through a canny combination of the two. There's the mad Mad Hatter (played by a typically loopy Johnny Depp), the growling Bandersnatch, the slyly smiling Cheshire Cat, the virtuous White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the roly-poly twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and the dragon-like Jabberwocky, which it has been prophesied Alice will slay, thereby liberating the people of the kingdom from their tyrannical queen.<br/><br/>Burton breathes new life into this oft-told and oft-filmed tale thanks to a team of visual and special effects wizards who come as close to capturing the world of Carroll's imagination as any group of filmmakers could ever be expected to, given the enormity of the challenge.<br/><br/>As the heroine who must learn to accept the impossible before she can know who she truly is, Mia Wasikowska manages to keep Alice life-sized and appealing even in the midst of all the larger-than-life pyrotechnics going on around her.<br/><br/>A masterpiece of art direction, costume design and special effects, this ""Alice in Wonderland"" is the next best thing to the books themselves."
"siderite","5","3","5","19 February 2011"," Amazingly boring and unrelated to the books

There was a scene where 3D animated dogs and pups play together. They should have taken that and made it a movie and forget about the Alice in Wonderland idea.<br/><br/>What was also incredible to me was the enormous distance from the books to this ""adaptation"". Go on, read the Wikipedia article on Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. The genius of Lewis Carroll was not in making another book about a delusional child, but the internal logic of the worlds and the mathematical and chess foundations of the work. It was something special. They completely trashed that.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Tim Burton usually makes terrifyingly beautiful animation and script work. This was both banal and boring. I didn't really like Mia Wasikowska in In Treatment, but she was brilliant in that show compared to the cold ""I am just going with it because I don't care"" look in this film.

","From about fifteen minutes after this movie began to the final credits, I sat baffled. Clearly Tim Burton and the screenwriter Linda Woolverton wished to create a magical fantasy- adventure tale for children about a clash between good and evil, along the lines of the Narnia movies, and that's all fine and good. But why on earth did he call it Alice in Wonderland?<br/><br/>The movie begins with a teenaged Alice (Mia Wasikowska), her spirit cramped by her repressive Edwardian life, tumbling down the proverbial rabbit-hole into ""Underland"". Familiar characters soon appear -- the White Rabbit, the Caterpillar, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, etc -- but inform her that she is the ""wrong Alice."" They needed the original, it seems, to be their champion, and to slay the ferocious Jabberwocky and throw off the evil tyranny of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham-Carter). The Queen, hypersensitive about her outsized head, has ravaged Underland and enslaved its people, with the help of the incongruously menacing Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover)... so wait, a playing card is acting as henchman to a chess piece? Well, let it go.<br/><br/>Well of course this older Alice may well be the real one after all, fancy that, it's just that (we're told) she's lost her ""muchness."" ""My muchness?"" asks Alice. The speaker indicates her heart: ""In there."" Oh, lord. This is of course another variant of those barfy lines so beloved by screenwriters and studio executives, in which the protagonist is informed that she must regain her heart/soul/sense of wonder/sense of fun/idealism/so on in order to succeed. This will then become the movie's doggedly predictable emotional journey. And I am truly depressed to announce that this tired line comes from... the Mad Hatter. The Mad Hatter, dispensing this hackneyed Hollywood ""wisdom""? It's like Keith Richards showing up at your door as a Jehovah's Witness.<br/><br/>It's not that everything's bad here. Helena Bonham-Carter plays the despotic Red Queen with tiny pursed lips, and she's very funny. The plump Cheshire Cat, purred by Stephen Fry, swims through the air like a manatee. Even at his weakest, Burton's visuals can be compelling, and the battle with the Jabberwocky is undeniably exciting.<br/><br/>But when the plot calls for heroics the movie feels misguided: the poem ""Jabberwocky"" was a *parody* of heroic epics (I'm guessing specifically Beowulf), and the solemnity that the movie keeps sinking into was exactly the sort of ponderousness Carroll loved to skewer. Is this really Wonderland? When the evil Knave of Hearts, hunting Alice, arrives at the Tea Party, he scornfully tells the Hatter, ""You're mad."" Well, I mean, duh. What is he, new around these parts?<br/><br/>Burton has a message he wants to get across, that ""nonsense"" and ""madness"" can help us do the impossible, by unleashing our imagination. That's not a bad message, but it's not the message of Alice in Wonderland. The books derive humor from nonsense; they don't endorse it.<br/><br/>The Alice of the books doesn't have much fun. She's insulted and bullied and ordered around by the Wonderlanders; their foolishness frustrates rather than beguiles her. The first book ends in a trial. It's a farce, of course. The witnesses are incoherent, the King as judge is buffoonish and arbitrary, and the Queen of Hearts repeatedly orders unjustified beheadings. Alice, fed up with the travesty, protests. The Queen orders, ""Off with her head!"" Alice retorts ""Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack of cards!"" And at this gloriously sensible observation, the court literally flies apart.<br/><br/>Carroll was, after all, a logician, and if he intended any message to Alice in Wonderland beyond simple entertainment, it's here: that people who pretend to power are often only speaking balderdash. Nonsense has only as much power as we allow it to have. If we're clear-eyed enough to see through it, that false power dissolves.<br/><br/>But in this movie, it takes a full army and the slaying of a monster to defeat the Queen. That's giving too much power to nonsense."
"wileflowr4","10","3","5","11 September 2010"," Critical review - meeting a new Alice
","I finally watched Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland,"" and am very happy about it. First - everyone remember that this is not the book, and not a retelling of the usual story in ""Alice in Wonderland"" movies past! I watched previews, and went into the film expecting it to be something new. Having read Lewis Carrol's ""Through the Looking Glass"" and ""Alice in Wonderland,"" and having studied the poem ""The Jabberwocky"" in 5th grade or so, I was pleased to recognize much that you might find totally new and bizarre. I appreciate the addition of characters from ""The Jabberwocky"" (as they are originally in Wonderland, if I remember right) - it adds a dimension of the impossible to the surprisingly organized world of Wonderland. The book (I think ""Alice in Wonderland,"" but it might be ""Through the Looking Glass"" - need to read them again to be sure) is organized like a chess game. Every new place/task that Alice encounters is physically separated by a stream or a forest or something, like the square spaces on a chess board. In each space, Alice has to solve some type of problem - math is mixed up in the stories (like chess), and strategy, and it's all related to character-building, and (of course!) the characters themselves...Lewis Carrol was extremely fond of children, and the Wonderland stories were originally invented to amuse the children of a close friend (there have been suspicions of pedophilia in his nature, but they are ungrounded and I think completely false. I believe that Lewis Carrol loved children because he still was one, or wanted to be. Anyway.) The author often came up with puzzles and riddles for the kids to solve, and the book (or maybe both books) is a checkered boardful of puzzles to figure out. That said, I see a lot of chess-y things in Burton's version. Like the book, it makes me wish I knew chess better. There's also the use of color - the red queen versus the white queen. Most of the red queen's domain is closer to black...but it's important that red is the opposite of white here, NOT flat black. The red queen wonders if it's better to be feared than loved - she makes her own choice, but it's also important to note that she HAS a choice, and humanly waffles over it. You would expect a color to be associated with white, since red = black, but that's not the case. The white queen and her consort are white, white, white (granted many things have strong colors on both sides. Burton excellently uses color to make us see black and white, yet the complexity of a world that has both.) There are certain things that are very strong blue, but they are associated with Alice - the impossible, the x factor, the catalyst, the viewer (you). Blue does not take a side, maybe it includes both. Finally, Wonderland is a return to childhood that retains the wisdom of an older person. Loss of innocence in the course of living cannot be denied, but when you return to your first loves, hopes, dreams, you find that they can work! in an amazing and true way. Loss of innocence is not loss of life, or love. I find that this film is not just about ""finding yourself."" ..as in, you're not looking for a person who stays the same and is easy to recognize. You find yourself changed -older, experienced, more or less certain, more or less smart- yet somehow you are the same. Hard to explain, so I'll just say: It's about finding yourself New."
"Ej2012","10","3","5","5 September 2010"," One of the best Adapting films from a book I've seen.
","I Knew about this film between the years 07-08, somewhere around there. And It I have to say it lived up to my expectations. <br/><br/>The story or plot as we all know is based off of Lewis Carroll's Fantasy epic Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the looking glass, I read the first story last year (09) for a book report in school but I have never read ""Through the Looking Glass"" but I have the version with Kate Beckensale. The first book is actually a dark tail before Disney, Disneyfied it back in the 50's (I have also seen that who hasn't?) it' a far cry from this one I'm writing about. <br/><br/>The movie starts off in the real world but within 15-20 minutes she's in the post-apocalyptic world of Wonderland. I liked that the story kicked off right away. The film was harsh with a lot of betrayal est. The only time you do see any death is well at the end. You can see how it's a kids movie but at the same time I can see why it got a PG rating instead of G, Tim Burton caught the dark feel of the story and for that ""I take my hat off"" I however did get into the story as if I was there over Alice's shoulder the entire time watching the events that was happening to her,<br/><br/>The special effects were fun and just fit in great with the story, They were just a little bit cartoon but I also think that was the point of the creatures, with The Red Queens giant head you get a feel for how it's meant to be. The characters were fun also with The Mad Hatter being well Mad, The March Hare looking, and acting like a Crack addict (It was funny) and Helena with her huge head, EST!<br/><br/>The Acting, I feel I don't even have to type anything for that acting, it's an all star cast with Johnny Depp (The Mad Hatter), Helena Carter (The Red Queen), The White Rabbit (Michel Sheen), and The Caterpillar (Allen Rickman) along with many more. Mia Wasikowska who played Alice, I've never herd of and she did a wonderful job with that role, once again ""I take my hat off"" only this time to Mia.<br/><br/>The story was adapted very well and is a fun imaginable movie you could only think of in your wildest dreams, but Tim Burton is a pro at bringing that vision to light. That is why I give, Alice in Wonderland (2010) A 10 out of 10"
"seane91","10","3","5","18 August 2010"," Best and most Creative movie ever made!
","It was a piece of art with marvelous graphics, fantastic acting and exhilarating action! Depp,Carter,and Burton do it again in this pleasant remake where they add much more then the sloppy original. It was beautifully put together and delightful to watch. The graphics where so surreal that it made Wonderland seem real. Praise was given to young actress Mia Wasikowska! It is a visual treat for the whole family. Award winning script is also very important part of the movie. A thing people don't appreciate is Burton's darkness but I for one I do. It shows you that not everything is a fairy tale, there is always going to be the realism of the good and the bad! So whether you are a fan of the trio I highly recommend this instant classic, not only for it's fascinating audio and visuals but because it is heartwarming and has a very good lesson!"
"RCWjr","9","3","5","19 June 2010"," Misunderstood
","I am not sure the expectations of most people going into a Tim Burton film. It seems there is a certain expectation and when they don't see what they thought they were going to see, they are disappointed or confused. I think that this film is a prime example of that. Burton has become such an iconic director that his celebrity, not what his talent, precedes him and sets an expectation.<br/><br/>Of all of Burton's latest films, I feel Alice is the most in line with his earlier work. It is a warped commercial vehicle that does exactly opposite of what you expect, which is the fun of going to see his films.<br/><br/>This Alice is a grownup version, as played wonderfully by Mia Wasikowska. She is caught between the young girl who is expected to do as she is told, yet like the younger Alice, walks her own path. Wasikowska's fresh face is welcomed; a more well known actress probably would not have worked as well.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter is warped, just as one would expect. Everything from an off center eye to breaking into a Scottish accent when remembering the past or in battle, Depp gives the Mad Hatter a sense of uneasiness. This is best exhibited in the scenes between he and Wasikowska. There is an uneasy attraction between Alice and the Hatter, one that has been lost from the books in the other adaptations. Here, Burton goes for showcasing that attraction and it pays off.<br/><br/>Bonham Carter devours the Red Queen, relishing every single minute and she is a joy to watch. Crispen Glover is perfectly cast as Stayne, her main man in many ways and himself eating up the scenery. In a surprise, Anne Hathaway's White Queen is purposely too calm and serene, almost to a chilling affect. Hathaway's gestures and manner of delivery give an uneasiness, that is fun to watch.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is voice talent; Matt Lucas as Tweeledee & dumb, Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Michael Sheen as the White Rabbit and Alan Rickman as the Blue caterpillar. All are perfectly voice cast and give weight to the creatures they play.<br/><br/>The special effects are wonderful to watch, I only wish I had seen it in 3-D. The effects are wonderfully warped, as usual with a Burton production. If anything, his warped artistic flair is perfect for this kind of story.<br/><br/>As with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Sleepy Hollow, Burton is far more faithful to the source than previous incarnations and coupled with his visual style, Alice is a fun film to watch over and over.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman ... Blue Caterpillar (voice)"
"rsa5387","5","3","5","5 June 2010"," Not Enough Nonsense
","Alice In Wonderland is quite ordinary, lacking the whimsicality of Carrol's books, and the zaniness of Disney's original 1951 production. Much like last week's Prince Of Persia, in place of an enchanting story, we get a soulless retread of the original, with an overabundance of CGI and little heart. Burton's Wonderland is more akin to an amusement park ride, jaunting from one green screen to the next, setting up one conflict after another. Skipping characterization in favor of nostalgia, Disney takes the blockbuster route, assuming that vague flashbacks and lazy alterations of the original work serve as a plot. The acting is toned down all-around, with Carrol's characters losing their carefree madness in favor of innocence. Depp's Hatter disappoints the most. He comes off as weak and sullen, when he should be as his name suggests, mad. The 'futterwacken' scene is an abomination. Bonhan-Carter fares the best, but her character comes off as foolish rather than conniving. Alice is a disappointment, suffering amnesia throughout the film to avert from her lack of characterization. We never get to spend too much time with Carroll's memorable side-characters, as Alice is reduced to simply being a tool that propagates our nostalgia, not interests our curiosity. On a positive note, The Cheshire Cat and Caterpillar were very well done. Overall, in interpreting this work to a new-generation, Burton has emphasized visual splendor, but lacks the storytelling prowess and imagination of Carrol's books. I don't blame Burton, as I am sure Disney had a hand in dumbing-down this film. Taking steps to make it appealing to the widest-audience possible, throwing creativity out for safety of profits, and advancement of 3D-gimmicktry. Much unlike the 1951 film."
"jodie78114","8","3","5","4 June 2010"," Shockingly Entetaining
","My family and I went to see this film despite my skepticism, I believed it was going to be another boring movie that entertained just our children; especially since the original didn't quite grab my wife or my attention. We found ourselves wildly entertained by this movie's engaging dialogue and unique creatures with strange but believable cinematography. It really captured our imagination and was shockingly entertaining. I found myself wanting more. Not to mention our children really enjoyed the special effects and interesting story line. It's a rare movie that both child and adult can really get into. I think Depp's performance was brilliant because he was truly mad but not in a weird uncomfortable way. I believe this part was probably his best acting performance."
"Robert_duder","8","3","5","4 April 2010"," A clever re-telling of the classic story in true Burton style
","First I should mention I did see Alice in Wonderland in 3D. I mention this because 3D is out of control and I am the President of the opinion that it truly is being overused and killed before it even begins. Does Step Up 3 need to be in 3D? Or Robin Hood, or Clash of The Titans or the dozens of other movies that are? Having seen Avatar in both forms I can tell you the 3D made little difference...Avatar was great because it was great. That being said Alice in Wonderland in 3D was truly a Wonderland. This was some of the best 3D I have ever seen including Avatar. The world is perfect to be seen in 3D and the characters are brilliant loud and boisterous. A true brilliant twist was for Burton and the film makers to make this a sequel that isn't a sequel at all. It combines everything from Alice In Wonderland, Through The Looking Glass, a new spin to the story but still this is a simple re-telling for the most part of the original Disney classic leaving out much of the extra in the novel behind. The only downside to this is that the film flies through the content too quickly and leaves you a little breathless by the end of it.<br/><br/>Mia Wasikowska, who is described as a newcomer, is truly terrific as the nearly twenty Alice who is being forced into adulthood and marriage. She really makes Alice come to life and I think she has a really terrific career ahead of her! She headlines this cast flawlessly. Helena Bonham Carter is absolutely amazing as the Red Queen. This is the second best 'animated' performance I have seen in less than a year (first being Zoe Zaldana's performance in Avatar.) Bonham Carter is wild and over the top of larger than life and she is a true classic Disney villain. If there is only one reason to see this movie she would be it. Fortunately she isn't the only reason. I certainly had no desire to see this for Johnny Depp. Depp is becoming a typical offbeat character actor after Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka and now The Mad Hatter. I figured it would be Willy Wonka all over again but I was completely wrong. Depp shows some incredible talent yet again putting actual heart and character but still maintaining what we all know and love about the Mad Hatter. Anne Hathaway, who is a great actress, doesn't really do much in her rather silly and contrived performance as The White Queen. She should have stuck with being offered the role of Alice because this does nothing for her career especially next to Bonham Carter. The full cast of supporting characters are really terrific including Crispin Glover, Matt Lucas (hilariously done), Stephen Fry (the best Cheshire cat in years), and Alan Rickman to name the best of the best in the cast.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is no stranger to bizarre and that really makes Alice In Wonderland perfect for him. When all is said and done he doesn't go too high off the deep end although Alice In Wonderland is already pretty deep but he does make it a bit of a dark and twisted story that makes it entertaining for adults and kids alike although young kids might find it a little too dark. Regardless if you want to see a truly great classic re-told with spin and looking stunning in 3D then Alice In Wonderland will really impress you. For those that seem to think it wasn't good or didn't meet expectations I think the idea of a fantasy epic is cut short because it flies through the story so quickly. All in all this one is a must see for the family and sure to become a classic in Disney standards. 8.5/10"
"AngelikaD","10","3","5","31 March 2010"," Visually astounding story of Alice at 19 developing into a champion and liberator of oppressed multitudes
","A worthy successor to the original book about the younger Alice, with original additions (such as proper names for animals and people unnamed in Lewis Carroll's book) that actually serve to enhance the mysterious atmosphere that permeates Underland (one of the felicitous, punny new terms). The time allotted for developing the minor characters did not detract from the furtherance of the plot but rather enriched the film and gave it more depth. They have just as much charm as those in the book the film takes off from. The pumping-up of minor characters such as Tweedledum and Tweedledee and the Dormouse (who also gets a name in this film), as well as the enhanced role of the Cheshire Cat, give more colors to the tapestry--although some loved characters, such as the White Knight, are missing. The added characters, such as the stuffy, beaky lordlet proposing to Alice in the London portions and the Knave of Hearts who toadies to the Red Queen, add to the landscape more-believable opponents for Alice to shake off in her quest to free the captives of an evil regime. The actors are all high-level. The comradely bond between Alice and the Mad Hatter grows slowly and organically, with exquisite timing for the various threats they face as they help one another. At one point near the end, the loving sideways look the Hatter casts at Alice is a masterpiece combination of kindness, pity, doubt, fear, and affection never seen before in one face at one time. Adding the Knave as his counterfoil works well, giving another source of conflict as a subtext. The way Alice stands up to him is superb. The acting overall seems neither too subdued nor overdone. Aspects of the film that could have been improved: Some of the special effects went by too fast to grasp; we are not given a long-enough look at the wondrously set long table of the Mad Hatter's tea party; and some of the dialog, especially including the unfamiliar proper names, speeds by too quickly for clear comprehension. I would also quibble with the inconsistency in the resizing (or not) of Alice's clothing as she shrinks and as she shoots up tall. Overall, the set designs are in harmony with the combination of reality and fantasy that it is the goal of the film to portray. The multiple-hat-making session, the antics of the Dormouse, and several other scenes are laugh-out-loud amusing. The costuming is imaginative, varied, and often stunning, crying out for a major film award (especially note the scene in which the Mad Hatter is furiously making hats). The musical score enhances the dramatic experience at every turn, especially during the persecution and chase scenes. At some times it is too loud and overwhelming. But overall, it is magnificent, and it especially propels and undergirds the story as the film nears its climax The original book centered on a fantastical experience in another world for its own sake. This film, centered on an almost-adult teenager in a repressive society, is more a story of Alice's character development. Her inner journey from reflexive fear reactions to determined, courageous fighting against evil in some ways evokes the Bildungsroman genre. This film is ideal for taking girls from seven to any age of adult to see, especially those who are facing difficulties that tend to seem overwhelming to them. The film shines at building up a credible development of Alice's character as she succeeds in overcoming one after another of ever more daunting and seemingly impossible opponents, roadblocks, and limitations. After seeing a movie like this, it is hard not to emerge both euphoric and equal to any challenge."
"John_Truby","5","3","5","30 March 2010"," Alice in Wonderland
","Alice in Wonderland is one of the greatest stories of all time, with arguably the best story world ever invented. It is also notoriously difficult to turn into a film. And the reasons all have to do with the script. The most recent version of Alice, written by Linda Woolverton, is the latest disappointment, and a close look at the choices she made are very instructive to those of us who love the craft of screen writing.<br/><br/>Alice is a classic fantasy story, and in many ways it set the form. A little girl, living in a highly organized, mundane world, travels to an upside-down fantasy world of illogic and returns to the real world freer and a little more grown up as a result. The overall structure of the original story is very tight. The problem comes in the middle, because the middle is structured according to the myth form, not fantasy.<br/><br/>Alice is on a journey in Wonderland, which means that the story is highly episodic. Each scene is a new encounter with strange new characters. While these individual scenes are invariably fun and extremely creative, they do not build. This is the great challenge of any writer using what I call ""journey plot"" (see ""The Anatomy of Story""). It has stumped writers from Cervantes (Don Quixote) to Dickens (Oliver Twist) to Twain (Huckleberry Finn). The main reason the episodic element doesn't hurt the original Alice in Wonderland is that the book is so short. But that won't work for a feature-length film.<br/><br/>If we look at what Woolverton did in adapting the original story, we can see that almost all her choices were designed to overcome this episodic quality. The problem is that while her choices decrease the episodic quality, they also represent paint-by-number storytelling that gets increasingly boring as the story goes on.<br/><br/>It's ten years later. The new Alice is a young woman trapped in the same stifling world and facing the prospect of a stultifying marriage to a rich fool. The trip to the fantasy world is supposed to force the heroine to confront her personal weakness. But notice in this set up, the craziness of Wonderland won't force Alice to change because she's a rebel from the beginning. The single greatest feature of the original Alice in Wonderland is that the fantasy world is based on illogic. So it attacks the very way that logical Alice and the audience think, the way we construct the world. Because this new Alice is never shown to be part of the ""normal"" worldview, fantastical Wonderland is just a series of strange landscapes.<br/><br/>To focus the story, Woolverton suggests the ending by showing a scroll in which Alice kills the Jabberwocky in the final battle. This sets up the vortex of the story that is supposed to sequence events at increasing speed. Now Alice's journey has an endpoint, so each stop is not a stand-alone moment but a step on the path to her final destiny where she will save the kingdom.<br/><br/>But by turning Alice into an action hero, Woolverton has made a pact with the story devil. Action stories typically have even less plot than myth stories, not just because big action set pieces stop plot but also because the audience knows that nothing big is going to happen until the final showdown. And in this film nothing does. Woolverton is still stuck with the journey plot, which makes it extremely difficult to add plot through reveals. Without surprises, the plot must die.<br/><br/>The other major technique Woolverton adds to overcome the episodic quality of the original story is to bring some of the major characters along for the ride. So, for example, instead of leaving the Mad Hatter after the tea party, he comes along as an important ally to help Alice kill the Jabberwocky and defeat the Red Queen. Bringing characters along on the journey and having a single ongoing opponent is always a good idea when you're writing a myth story. It allows the audience to care about the characters more intensely and increases the power of the opposition. But the value of these two techniques is largely removed when the heroine's goal is so predictable and mundane as fighting a dragon in a big final battle.<br/><br/>Many people have expressed disappointment with director Tim Burton for this visually stunning but boring film. But visuals have always been what Burton is good at, not story. I find it fascinating to compare how a visual artist like Burton (Batman and Batman Returns) and master screenwriter-storytellers like Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David Goyer (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight) handled the same Batman story material. Frankly, there is no comparison, and it's one more proof that movies aren't a ""visual"" medium, they are a story medium.<br/><br/>Ironically, screenwriter Woolverton's efforts to unify and build the story stripped the film of the great strength of the original story, which are the breathtakingly original characters and scenes. And Burton's vaunted ability to create strong visual worlds totally misfired when he failed to base his visuals on the defining principle of the Alice in Wonderland story world, which is the brilliant illogic and nonsense that only a professor of logic could create.<br/><br/>One day a screenwriter may solve the riddle of making a great Alice in Wonderland film. That will be a great accomplishment that I would love to see."
"rockndaparadise","6","3","5","29 March 2010"," Flawed...but harmless
","Well, well, well. To start things off, I've been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I first heard about it in 2007. I mean, seeing a Tim Burton adaptation of ""Alice in Wonderland"" sounded like a really cool idea, and having Johnny Depp, Alan Rickman and Christopher Lee in the cast? How can you go wrong? Well, after seeing it for the first time, it was quite a let down. First of all, this is a Disney movie, and it's kind of weird knowing that this is a remake of a movie that was made by the same company. Well, it's actually not a remake. This is actually a sequel that just so happens to have the same title. However, unlike Disney's line of direct-to-DVD sequels, for this one, they attempted to do something very different. A couple positives I can point out is that we get to know more about the characters such as Alice's last name as well as her sister's name, plus I did catch a lot of references to the original classic. The beginning was interesting, but once Alice came into Wonderland, things went downhill. It's like everything was just shoved into my face. I didn't care much for the story; it was a little untraditional. The characters were OK. The Mad Hatter was good, so was the caterpillar, the Red Queen was consistent, the Cheshire Cat was amusing, but the rest of the characters were just all over the place. It's like, What happened? What's going on? What's this? What's that? What's everything? The whole movie was so confusing. It seemed like the creators were putting special effects before story. The 1951 classic has a lot of charm and warmth, and it makes you look forward to watching it again, but this new one doesn't have the same warmth. Overall, this was not a terrible movie, nor was it a cinematic masterpiece; it's a good movie that has a lot of flaws. If you're wanting to see a good movie that'll live in your heart, then don't watch this movie; it's not worth your time, unless you're a huge fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. If you are a fan of them, then I'm sure you'll rank this as an A+ film, 10 out of 10, 5 stars out of 5, whatever. I'd really hate to see Disney do this to other classics they've done. (Oh, wait, I think they already did.) So, yeah, in conclusion, I highly recommend this film to Tim Burton fans and Johnny Depp fans, but not to fans of the original Disney classic."

","I went to see this in theatres today with a friend of mine from church. This movie brings back the childhood memories of Alice returning to Wonderland in her teen years and I never seen her do that. Johnny Depp did a good job playing The Mad Hatter (w/ red hair) How silly is that ? He made me laughed. In this story Alice is on her quest to rescue her friends from danger with the help from the White Queen. My favorite part is Alice ""trying to get back to her normal size"" and finding herself in the middle of nowhere where she can go on a quest in Wonderland where she meets her friends again. ALICE IN WONDERLAND is based on ""Looking Through The Glass"" novel and a remake version (similar) to RETURN TO OZ (Disney's 1984-Wizard of OZ Sequel). Its like Dorothy had returned to Oz to see whats going on at Emerald City."
"bdschwantner","6","3","5","22 March 2010"," One Word Summary: lolwut?
","This movie just left a bad taste in my mouth. It had a great deal of potential, what with gorgeous sets and gorgeous and talented stars, but it didn't do much with them. The acting was generally quite good, as befits the aforementioned gorgeous stars, but the lines the actors were speaking were generally average, occasionally just trite and lame.<br/><br/>The writing was nothing surprising. Every single line was formulaic, from Alice's predictably whimsical musings about flying to the Hatter's tritely ""meaningful"" repetitions, to the reoccurring admonitions that one need only ""believe."" Seriously, Disney. You've worn these tropes pretty thin over the years.<br/><br/>Howabout an utterly non-whimsical female lead, or a kooky mentor who encourages the hero to -dis-believe? Shake up the formula just a little, pretty please? Let me qualify my statements. This movie is by no means terrible, though it is terribly average. This movie's sin is not proactive horribleness, but rather passive mediocrity. All the usual characters and set pieces are right where we expect them, nothing to surprise us anywhere (not even the rather out of place dance at the end).<br/><br/>The ""lolwut"" in the title is what kept popping in my head as I saw one well-tread cliché after another break dance across the screen. What indeed. With all this potential squandered on mediocrity, I could not fully enjoy even the otherwise fun story. Bad taste in mouth."

","Tim Burton is a grim man and has had more misses then hits, but this is definitely a hit. Johnny Depp was great as the Mad Hatter, he was every thing the Mad Hatter needed to be. the only down side was the bright orange wig he had on, but what they did with his eye make-up was fab. The Cat was always my favorite character from the original story, and with Stephen fry as the voice it remains so. Mia as Alice was a fresh face on an old character, she made Alice her own and she owned it. Anna and Helena as the White and Red Queen's blew me Anna with her regal but tough and Helena with her brass and slightly scary kept me laughing, but my all time favorite was Tweedledum and Tweedledee played by Matt Lucas, both cute and funny and as confusing as they should be. The one thing that can be said is anyone looking for the cookie cutting, cutie, simple remake of the original Disney version, then don't see this movie, if you are looking for something like the book, then don't see this movie, if you are looking for a movie about a girl who travel to a different world and finds herself in the process then this is the perfect movie. Tim Burton Got It Right and I had a good time. Oh and see it in 3D it's way better that way."

","I generally never give a movie a 10 of 10, unless it completely overtakes me in some way and leaves me talking about it for days. However, it does receive a high ""9 of 10"" due to the inspiration it has given me. If it can bring just a hint of tears to my eyes, it's a good movie and touched me to some level. <br/><br/>The last time I read ""Alice in Wonderland"" was back when I was a child and many years ago. This movie has a similarity to the original plot, but Tim Burton has extended it out further for a deeper insight to ""Alice in Wonderland"". There are moments in the movie where it led me to a whole new storyline, but made sense to the whole Alice theme.<br/><br/>I personally love the new version. I just find it rather amusing that Tim Burton have to take on the challenge of adapting his version of the story to Disney, since it is a Disney storyline we're talking about. The characters do look a little intimidating though, typical Tim Burton film.<br/><br/>Still, he did a rather splendid job at that. Like with any Disney movies, there's a lesson or morale to be learned: Believe in yourself."

","this is a wonderful film to watch in the mould of 'Enchanted. In that film, the Princess goes from the fantasy world to the real world but in this movie the opposite happens and Alice goes from reality to fantasy. Not familiar with the leading actress as Alice, never heard of her before but wow for Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter just like his roles in Edward Scissorhands, Charlie and Chocolate Factory, Dr Parnissus and of course Sweeney Todd. That brings me to the fine acting chemistry Depp has with Helena Bonham Carter who the Red !Queen. This is not a sequel but an adaptation of one persons interpretation of the main story with a few variations to make the film more interesting and to give characters greater depth, particularly Mad Hatter and the Chesire Cat. Great voice overs by the likes of Timothy Spall Barbara Windsor and Stephen Fry.<br/><br/>This is essentially an English film through and through. No American accents thank the Lord, Depp puts on a fabulous Scottish accent thanks to R C Nesbit. Its a foreign fairytale with lots of morals and although I call it a family film, its not really a kids film like Enchanted was and obviously because its half and half real life and animation, Disney preferred to promote Up first for Oscar 2010 nomination.<br/><br/>The chess board battle scene towards the end of the film was a wonderful Burton gimmick with the Queen the Knight and the creation of the Jabberwicky character.<br/><br/>Its not an emotional film, wont make you laugh or cry much but it will keep you interested throughout. Very entertaining, some nice dialogues and great interactions between the main characters. Mad Hatter definitely steals the show for me as soon as I first came on the set and worst point I must agree with earlier comment to be the overuse of the White Queens fingernails! Not quite a must see film but if you love Alice in Wonderland and the characters, you will surely like this movie."

","I have to say that I'm not familiar with neither Disney animated version, any other film adaptations or the books themselves. I knew the basics of the story, I enjoyed some Tim Burton movies very much and I liked the special effects in the stills I saw, so I decided to go ahead and give it a try.<br/><br/>Alice In Wonderland is a film you WANT to see in Imax, as in my opinion which I'm not afraid to proudly stand - the 3D is more impressive than in Avatar. Not the special effects, don't get me wrong, the 3D itself, some sequences are really impressive.<br/><br/>I mentioned special effects - here, I'm pretty sure there are no competitors for an Oscar for 2010! Simply perfect!<br/><br/>The plot is crazy but that's how it's supposed to be, the characters the same with Johnny Depp in another flawless performance leading the group as a Mad Hatter. Lots of great creatures, talking animals etc. that you'll love.<br/><br/>The world Burton created competes with Pandora pretty equally, it's the matter of opinion, but the magic is seen everywhere. The costumes and makeup are sure Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>But enough about MAKING, let's say something about the MOVIE.<br/><br/>Well, alright. The movie is a little bit more than 1.5h of pure magic. I caught myself watching this spectacle with open mouth, smiling all the time. What we see is again the work of great imagination, and perfect film-making.<br/><br/>Awesome adventure!"
"LazySod","9","3","5","16 March 2010"," One step short of brilliant
","Based on two books written for children in the late 19th century this film is one adaptation out of many. The story line works well enough, if you're into fairy tales and the sometimes odd angles they take. Personally I love a good fairy tale, especially if it's a bit dark and twisted, so this works well for me.<br/><br/>This adaptation is then done in part computerized graphics, part acting, part cross-over. Added to that is a layer of 3D effects that make for a solid immersion in a world that is strange for most - but terrifyingly believable as well. For me the way the scenery was designed matched perfectly of what I remembered from the books - which I read as a child, years ago.<br/><br/>The computer graphics are wildly colored and often heavily exaggerated but it fits the story and therefore works out really well. Music doesn't really jump out, but fits. Acting is fitting, with only a very small number of very small kinks. The choice of rolling events works very well, with only one or two falling out of place/style.<br/><br/>All in all, I had high expectations when I walked into the theater - I generally love Tim Burton's work, especially when it combines with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter because the three of them always make for a well matched team, and I also love the original Alice in Wonderland story and its sequel. And although that usually means the expectation gets shattered while actually watching the film it wasn't in this case - this film offered all I wanted and more.<br/><br/>So, apart from one or two out-of-place/style scenes, there's only one word describing this film and that word is brilliant.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 rabbits in a deep hole"

"Ahobbs_89","Null","4","8","6 June 2010"," Why all the hate?
","I have read some of the reviews that have been posted on here, as well as on Empire and so forth and I just need to ask: Why does everyone hate this film? Granted it's not Burton's best (unlike say Edward Scissorhands or Sweeney Todd) but it is Burton showing what he does best: create a weird and wonderful (primarily visual) world. Johnny Depp is not spectacularly awful as the Mad Hatter, but I do feel that the use of the Scottish accent was over-egging the pudding just a little bit. Mia Wasikowska is going to be a major star in the future, and this is the major leg-up for her that will attract people to see The Kids Are Alright and Jane Eyre, which sounds it will be fantastic. She is by far and a way a bright light that is a bout to explode into a supernova in Hollywood.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast perform their roles terrifically. Anne Hathaway's White Queen is sweet and sinister in equal measures, but I feel they could have done more with her character, perhaps showing her dark side a little more. For Bonham Carter, Rickman and Fry, the roles of Red Queen, Caterpillar and Cheshire Cat respectively, fit like gloves. Their voices, as well as actual performances, in Ms Carter's case, made me feel as though they are the defining representations of the characters. Although, it has to be said, Bonham Carter does seem to be channelling Queenie from Blackadder to a great degree.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen, Barbara Windsor, Timothy Spall and Matt Lucas all scrabble for screen time, and they all get it, and are perfectly adequate in their performances. The main trouble that most people seem to have with the film is the story. Granted, it does seem to be in the vein of Hook and Return to Oz in the sense that the Heroine has to return to their childhood adventureland and discover their destiny. In that respect, the film can't decide if it's a re-imagining or a sequel, which may infuriate some devout Carroll-heads. But to be fair, the original story of Alice has been told so many times by so many different directors that if Burton had stuck religiously to the book,. there would have been no surprises or excitement for anyone.<br/><br/>Also, to those who say that this is Burton's least personal film; Alice is an outcast in Victorian society, who then finds companionship in The Hatter, who's just as much an outcast as she is, and then goes off to slay a giant monster to save her friends and prove she's capable of taking charge of her life. This is what runs throughout most of Burton's movies: The outsider making their own way in the world. And who says the film is not dark enough: the girl has to make her way across a moat by usign decapitated heads as stepping stones! <br/><br/>In conclusion, if you (like me) love Burton, go ahead and see it and decide what you make of it. It is a crazy, wonderful mad film with great performances and spectacular visual effects. It's just not a great one."
"sameh_hameedi","2","4","8","5 June 2010"," Woe in Wonderland as Burton makes a horrible cinematic experience...
","Tim Burton is an unusual director. He is extremely talented, very gifted, with visions that overwhelm all but himself. Perhaps that is why his work is a bit of an acquired taste. He is capable of making fantastic films but every now and again he makes one which is horrible.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland is the perfect example. Much of the story is sacrificed, with the main focus being the CGI, which I have to say is not very good. Compared to other movies with much smaller budgets, it is quite poor. Johnny Depp's is the only good performance in the movie, and that too wasn't up to his usual standard. Mia Wasikowska's Alice is extremely wooden meanwhile The Red Queen was a character I could not stand, simply because she was so bloody irritating. <br/><br/>Somehow, I managed to endure the movie, surviving a long painful, and rather boring experience. Nothing in the film interested me, nothing gripped me, nothing made me want to see more. With every passing second that I watched the movie, I fell down a long, thin hole of bad cinema. And at the end there was no Wonderland. Just a horrible experience that I will try to forget..."
"PaulFarver","3","4","8","20 April 2010"," A disappointing movie
","Before I start this review, I'd like to tell you about my expectations. I'm not very fond of Disney's productions, but I was looking forward to see a classic story in a new movie. I like Johnny Depp's acting a lot, and hoped he could give the movie a nice little twist. Tim Burton is in the top 10 of my list of favorite directors, and I like his dark setting.<br/><br/>I was disappointed...<br/><br/>It isn't the classic story of Alice In Wonderland, but some kind of weird sequel thing, though the title implicates something else. It doesn't catch you and it's kind of random. Of course some highly educated art-freak would blabber a lot about symbols and stuff. And yes they're there, but what does that help if they are told so boring? If you want a movie with a great message and stuff this is not it. It's just the same old Disney standard.<br/><br/>The acting is well enough, but not a masterpiece... I won't give this much attention. It's okay to watch, and of course Depp makes it all a little more... special. I must admit I giggled a couple of times. The villain is pretty good, but can be a little too much from time to time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I didn't see the 3D edition, so I can't tell you about those effects. But I must say that the ones I saw was incredibly nice... Well, not certain parts of the movie, but overall astonishing. I especially like The Smiling Cat. This is a plus, definitely!<br/><br/>Overall boring and not worth watching. Even Burton failed to make his dark atmosphere. Nice effects and okay acting is the only thing causing my 3 stars. A movie for children."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","4","8","11 April 2010"," A mature epiphany
","This film is the most surprising adaptation of this typically Victorian novel for children written by Lewis Carroll and published in 1865, one hundred and fifty years ago. Centered on a woman, Alice, it is a memento about the role of women in society and their necessary liberation. The queen was Victoria and as such was setting an example, and in 1865 she was still young. Lewis Carroll with his two queens fighting for supremacy and the crown is providing a caricature of what the world would be if only women were at the top and that is a direct allusion to the debate of the time when Queen Victoria became a widow and refused to remarry. Behind this discourse about the liberation of women, or rather the promotion of women into responsible positions in the world, there is the discourse that they need men to stabilize and balance their government, their authority. It is obvious that Alice ending up as the captain (really?) of a colonial ship is the modern addition to the tale. <br/><br/>But this story is of course the matrix of a tremendous amount of children's literature in England, though rarely so much oriented on women. We can think of The Chronicles of Narnia by another Lewis, C.S. this one, where girls and boys are more equally balanced. And in this case there is also at the beginning a tyrannical queen. We could on the other hand think of Tolkien and his Hobbit or his Lord of the Ring and there men and boys, all males of course, are vastly dominant and we go back to the plain old pattern. This being said what is the creative dimension of this particularly adaptation?<br/><br/>First of all the technique is using all kinds of tricks to manipulate the pictures and make people disappear or appear, the cat particularly. Along the same line it uses monstrous beings like the Jabberwocky, or distorted beings like the two fat boys. On the other hand some are supremely realistic like the dogs. He is also able to use a mixture of digitally mastered beings like the card soldiers within a ""natural"" setting and with human actors. But those techniques are now very standardized in the cinema with Dreamworks Studios for example or the various Star Wars films.<br/><br/>The second originality of this film is that it is entirely in full colors, and the dark scenes are rare, in the forest a little bit and a couple of night scenes. But otherwise it is luxuriant in colors, both the real world and Wonderland, called Underland or not. I must admit too that the fall in the dark hole is extravagant and brilliantly composed. <br/><br/>The third element is of course the use of the strange mysterious language the hatter and some others practice. That language is typical of Lewis Carroll who has been using that type of meaningless gibberish language in many poems too, like The Hunting of the Snark. Lewis Carroll was a mathematical mind in a way and he considered that what Saussure was going to call the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign was absolute and thus anyone could invent new signs, meaning words, as long as the syntax, the formal rules associating these words, and the intonation were respected. So in his world ""Fridig imeas man flowbaster fluously akum spoul midsten spoof,"" as long as the intonation centers properly on the modal ""man"" and the verb ""flowbaster."" We understand the intonation of what the hatter says not the words but that does not matter because it is the Hatter and he is there to make us believe we are in another universe. <br/><br/>The fourth element is the overflowing of all kinds of feelings and emotions in this film. The characters are suffering, crying, getting angry, fearful and frightened, they start running away and hiding and yet are captured and beheaded while one queen is enjoying such torturing and capital punishment and at the same time the other queen seems to be weak and maybe even impotent. And what is that queen who has taken vows that prevent her from defending her own country and people? That's the aristocratic superiority wrapped up in vows that sound kind of religious. Is she a nun or something? She does not sound very pleasant. <br/><br/>The fifth element I like and dislike at the same time is the forced cohabitation of the red queen and her knight in exile tied up one to the other. That's cruel and useless. Why didn't Tim Burton put them to work at some useful task, not useful for them but useful for the people, like cleaning up their mess and rebuilding the ruins? In other words Tim Burton did not modernize the tale entirely, certainly not enough.<br/><br/>The sixth point is the Hatter. He was of course expected to be great and Johnny Depp makes it outstanding, outscoring, outreaching in all directions and he is really superb, except his last dance, a fudderwupping that looks like no whipping no feathers not at all and which could sound OK on paper but does not look that realistic nor attractive, like some kind of extravaganza by some contorsionist, though I would prefer it here in German, ein Schlangenmensch or eine Schlangenfrau or even why not ein Schlangenweib. But that sounds and looks barbaric. I am sure Tim Burton could have thought of something more realistic that children could have imitated like some voodoo trance extreme dancing. That's Tim Burton's problem: at times he overuses his technology and seems to think a technical prank has to be artistically good. But it is not always the case.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"dmh7-1","6","4","8","29 March 2010"," A Botched Combo of Oz and Lord of the Rings...
","This is a visually seductive movie which seems to be on the verge of becoming intriguing up until the terrible moment it devolves into a fantasy action film, at which point its connection to the whimsy and strangeness of the novel severs entirely. The second portion of the film is difficult to enjoy for anyone who appreciates the linguistic torsions of the novel, and that book's celebration of a level-headed child resisting the madness of adult social rules and vile tempers. The film's ending, in which Alice ""grows up"" and embarks upon a business career (in an imperialistic trading company of all things!) is even more profoundly errant. I don't know – maybe the tale is inherently difficult to capture well in film, or perhaps its age has passed, and become crushed by capital into just another venture. Yet, the ""flashback"" scene (where we see Burton's take on the original Mad Tea Party episode) seems to me to have been a shadow of a missed opportunity. Burton's usual oddity and comic/Gothic sensibility appears to have deserted him precisely at the moment it was most called upon. And the reduction of that supreme insane, the Mad Hatter, into as sort of stand-in for Baum's scarecrow is particularly sad. No amount of 3-D technology can salvage a story so horribly mangled. And - regretfully - at points there are sets and visuals very redolent of the Disney cartoon, which (as this is a Disney film) suggests an undue interference by the ""product's"" owners. Worth viewing, for its many visual surprises, and for the odd performance here and there (Helen Bonham Carter strikes me as especially fun in her raging role). But not a great success of mood or sensibility."

","Jan Svankmeyer made a great Alice back in 1988. It's quirky, surreal, dark, dreamlike and unnerving. Tim Burton's film on the other hand is a mixture of seen-it-all-before characters headed by the amazing Mr Depp in his worst screen role since Secret Window (I know a lot of people like it, I thought it was a stinker). What on earth is he doing? It's a performance akin to Shrek on Prozac.<br/><br/>The crowning glory for me was the breakdance (or whatever it was called). That was the lamest thing I've seen in years.<br/><br/>Every Tim Burton movie is now receiving the same treatment... the contorted Burton trees, the Burton misty atmosphere, the curly metalwork, the offbeat one-liner asides... I think he should go and make a conventional love story or a hard thriller and get back to basics. I'm completely fed up with this 'look' that pervades everything he makes.<br/><br/>Alice In Wonderland is a well known and well loved English masterpiece, written by a nineteenth century Tim Burton who created an original (yes, original) world, not based on any other. And originality is the problem with this film, there simply isn't any.<br/><br/>The plot is hard to follow. The acting is at best mediocre (apart from Tim's wife, who is good fun) and the direction just relies on the visuals. The CGI is totally over the top and the 3D element just isn't worth it. <br/><br/>The whole thing is a boring mess.

"vip_ebriega","8","4","8","19 March 2010"," An 'Alice' for a new generation. Another Burton classic comes to life.
","My Take: In Burton's version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, there is never the lack of imagination, wit, and a few dark touches of his previous works.<br/><br/>It's a bumpy ride down the rabbit hole and through the Looking Glass, but with Tim Burton as our guide, I wouldn't mind how far he would take me. Instead of adding to the multitude of screen adaptations of the beloved Lewis Carroll stories, Burton takes his own spin on the classic story, a decision that will no doubt anger some purists. But I take this move as a good thing. Other than being pure eye-candy, what Burton adds in his 'Alice'- something the original stories actually lacked- is direction. Unlike the previous versions, Burton's ALICE IN WONDERLAND is not just a series of odd characters strung together by a series odd situations, it's a full-blown adventure story. And filmed in gorgeous 3-D, taking a look through the Looking Glass will not be the same again.<br/><br/>Alice is not what you remember her to be. Wonderland (now Underland) is not what she remembers it to be either. Now 19 (and played by newcomer Mia Wasikowska), Alice is stubborn and headstrong, yet unable to fit in with the Victorian-age lifestyle of the society she grew up in. After rejecting the marriage proposal of her arrogant suitor (Leo Bill), she follows a familiar white rabbit down the rabbit hole and is thrown back into a world she has a vague recollection of, where she is welcomed as sort of a hero. See, Alice is destined to rid the land from the evil rule of the ill-tempered Red Queen (Helena Bonham-Carter, with a huge head) by slaying her pet Jabberwocky (voiced, briefly, by Christopher Lee). But the thing is, old acquaintances like the White Rabbit (voiced by Michael Sheen), The Chesire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), and Absolem the Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman) aren't quite sure is she's the ""real"" Alice.<br/><br/>Working with a script by Linda Woolverton (who wrote Disney's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST), Burton's 'Alice' is rooted in the world Carroll has imagined, but it has NARNIA and LORD OF THE RINGS in its blood. A warrior Alice may not be what Carroll had in mind with the character, but for Burton's darker and more mature 'Alice', it's an adequate coming-of-age for the character; everything that the story calls for. In other words, Alice in converted into another typical Burton figure; extraordinary yet misunderstood. Familiar characters from the original text are given much more light here, not to mention the much-anticipated performance by Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. It could have been a one-note, crazy performance by a gifted actor, but both Burton and Depp have done more. Scenes like the Hatter in deep depression when he tells Alice of what happened to Underland, adds gravity to the often hysterical character from the original stories. With her strong-willed spirit and her classy accent, newcomer Wasikowska is a perfect fit for Alice. But when it comes to the scene-stealing performance, Helena Bonham-Carter's over-the-top Red Queen wins every scene she's in. Supporting performances by Anne Hathaway (White Queen) and Crispin Glover (Knave of Hearts) are welcome touches. The film looks good on 3-D (more so on IMAX), and not because of the several ""in-your-face"" sequences, but because it enhances the experience; it immerses us into the (pardon the term) wonderful world Burton has created. The music and production design are all spot-on.<br/><br/>This a different and even darker ALICE than you remember. Do see ALICE IN WONDERLAND not as a straight retelling but as a stand-alone effort. Here Burton proves time and time again that the worlds he create are just as vast as his own imagination.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."
"dicksosa","8","4","8","17 March 2010"," Can you stand on your head?
","Tim Burton's wonderful imagination has brought another film full of fascination to life. Alice in Wonderland supports a wonderful cast of actors and characters that can't help but suck the audience in and make them feel as much a part of the world as Alice her self.<br/><br/>The visual entertainment of this film is exceptional as the dimensions and sizes of the world and the characters in it seamlessly shift from one perspective size to another. The sets and proportions of the world are all displayed together on the screen and never seem odd or out of place regardless of how they change.<br/><br/>Casting on this film is excellent with Johnny Depp putting on his stunning show as the Mad Hater. The red queen Helena Bonham Carter displaying her quirky and magnificent exclamation of ""Off with her head!"" And the wonderful portrayal of Mia Wasikowska as Alice is very memorable.<br/><br/>The film sucks the audience into the world of Alice and does well to keep the audience engaged for bits and pieces with the mystery of discovery of the world as well as the comedic shots that leap around in scene to scene. However the film does have just a slight lacking of fulfillment. It feels like there is just a small piece missing that one can't quite place their finger on. Perhaps it's simply that even with all the right pieces in place there needs just an extra piece to fully congeal into a masterpiece. That said the film is still an excellent rendition of the classic Lewis Carroll fable and recommended."
"kshiraj-telang","8","4","8","16 March 2010"," Burton's Alice in Wonderland – The darkest wonderland ever!
","A man who always wears a darker glass will have a tendency to see the world in front of him in a slightly darker shade. But the realization of the absorbed frames have never been a conundrum for the man who set a trend of mixing goth, gore and dark humor, sometimes in an interestingly creepy manner. And we call him Tim Burton.<br/><br/>His unmatched ability of giving adorability and cuteness to the living and non living darker elements is what sets him apart from the other directors. From Jack Skellington to Edward Scissorhands to the bloody big head-Red Queen, he has created his own aura of characters and leaving his fans craving for more.<br/><br/>Making alterations to a masterpiece needs some real gut and Tim again have shown his abundant vision and took the story to another level with some really sweet characters that only he can visualize. Who can forget the Red Queen and her playing card resembling army? Tim is also lucky to have such a wife in Helena who easily portrays any complex character and becomes ready to appear in the same skeleton that Tim had derived.<br/><br/>When it comes to the execution of the ideas, Tim Burton become crazier than you can ever think of. No one will forget the scene where The White Queen prepares the medicine with urine and some ugly looking fingers, for Alice.<br/><br/>Once again he has created a modern cinematic myth with his favorite cast and crew. He replaced the actual mood of the wonderland with his no sunshine environment and some signature props like the windmill and the famous limbs. He might probably be the only man in the earth whom god have given so much ""dark"" powers and yet doing good things."

","Most people seem to agree that Tim Burton is one of the best filmmakers that ever lived, but his re-imaginings tend to get lukewarm receptions, I wouldn't say that this is a total re-imagining though I feel pretty comfortable saying that is kind of a sequel. The story of this movie is pretty loosely based on the two books of Alice's adventures in Wonderland, for some weird reason called Underland here. Alice is nineteen years old, has a mind of her own, very imaginative and somewhat frustrated by the uptight people around her, she also is alarmed by recurring dreams of a magical world. When some stiff asks her hand in marriage, an arranged marriage that is, she runs off asking for a minute to think. She follows a white rabbit in a waistcoat down a rabbit hole and ends up in, you guessed it, Wonderland. Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dumb, the Doormouse, the White Rabbit, the Dodo Bird, and a Blue Caterpillar, constantly smoking a hookah, greet her with mixed feelings as they reveal that she is prophesied to slay the horrible Jabberwocky and end the reign of the Red Queen, though they doubt she is the right one and so does she, understandably. Alice believes the odd happenings to be a dream and is frustrated as all these bizarre characters seem to mistake her for another Alice who had come to Wonderland before.<br/><br/>One thing I will say first is the visuals are simply marvelous, everything is so vivid and colorful and the various creatures and characters are brought to the screen in a way that couldn't really be accomplished without computer animation, save for the somewhat superior traditional animated film. The queen with her gigantic head, the talking animals, talking flowers, card soldiers, they all look great. The battle between the forces of the White Queen and the Red Queen is great and the showdown between Alice and the Jabberwocky is definitely awesome. It's weird that this actually has a story, mostly borrowing from the second book I guess. The acting in the movie is great as always in a Tim Burton film. Johnny Depp brings a lot of charm and personality to the wacky Mad Hatter and totally immerses himself in the character, completely mad and always fun to watch, kind and welcoming at certain times, wild and angry other times. Mia Wasisowski makes Alice a very believable character and as rather than the one sane person in the crazy world, we see her as a young adult with a strong will and is seen as strange in the eyes of the no-nonsense people of her world. This is what Tim Burton has always been the master of, telling the stories of misunderstood characters we can sympathize with and empathize with. Alice's conflict with being what is expected of her is the driving force of the story and it works well.<br/><br/>The books were usually a stream of consciousness with a little girl wandering around meeting weird characters and poked fun at poetry and prose, as great fun as they were, there's a little more emotional connection here. The other characters are also pretty fun, the big headed and cruel and selfish Red Queen with voice and face of Helena Bonham Carter is amusing, though petty. The treacherous and arrogant Knave of Hearts, oddly played by Crispin Glover. Anne Hathway's performance as the White Queen is overacted but it works. Strangely enough, the voice acting is a real joy with all these weird computer animated characters, some of whom resemble the people provide their voices. Stephen Fry is the mysterious Cheshire Cat, Michael Sheen voices the hilariously psychotic March Hare, Matt Lucas as Tweedle Dee and Dumb, old Michael Gough voices the Dodo Bird in a brief scene and the amazing Christopher Lee is the Jabberwocky. Lee only says two lines but he makes that beast all the more scary. My only other little problems I guess are the very beginning and very ending, they seem just a little rushed. All in all, this is a very satisfying movie. I have yet to see a Tim Burton film that wasn't enjoyable and while this one may not be everyone's cup of tea, no pun intended, it's still a good movie."
"Simon_Bocanegra","10","4","8","15 March 2010"," All these reviews and nobody gets Tim Burton by a mile here
","This movie titled Alice in Wonderland is not about the book or previous movies titled Alice in Wonderland. Not in the slightest.<br/><br/>Burton has created another alchemical Grail story, and it holds up quite nicely. Think about Mozart's Queen of Night in The Magic Flute, the 2 beasts of the Apocalypse in the Revelation of St. John, King Arthur's sword Excalibur, Alice's disengagement from being Alice, and her insistence that it's all a dream she can awaken from anytime she wants- and you get where Burton wants to go with this. <br/><br/>He is creating a modern cinematic myth, and does a nice job with it. That's all I have to add.<br/><br/>Personally for sheer nostalgic purposes only, I would have enjoyed seeing cameos of Edward Scissorhands doing the gardens off to a corner when Alice first reenters Underland....and Captain Jack Sparrow as the Ship's Master at the end, but that would only have confused movie-goers even more...."

","Lets get something straight, most people are reviewing this and saying its horrible because its not like ""Alice in Wonderland"" (the classic). What Disney and the producer fail to mention is this movie is NOT based on that classic. Which is why so many are confused.<br/><br/>When it was in production the producer (at least at the time) said he based it on two things: A. the comic ""Return to Wonderland"" B. the game ""American Mcgees Alice""<br/><br/>Both of these are very grim and macabre things. So when you see this movie this is obviously not the direction they went it. Which is why the movie flopped. You can't make a ""sequal"" to a classic movie and try to make it kid friendly but make it like its macabre counter part and then screw around with the story. It just doesn't work. Its like the threw everything in a blender. <br/><br/>The theme they choose to was awful. Example the tiny bodies or Depps god awful character. I love Depp, hes always great in his roles but I don't ever want to see him again in this. <br/><br/>So this is why I gave it a 2. It ONLY gets a 2 because they didn't do a totally bad job with the graphics. Other then that the movie was horrible. I only seen it because my friend wanted to. <br/><br/>Save your money. If you really want to know what Alice does past the classics we know go read the comic or play the older game. You won't be disappointed. This movie is just a blemish in Wonderlands history."

","Wow--i waited for this for soo long and it just blew my mind of what an epic fail it was...it had absolutely no Alice in Wonderland nor Tim Burton spirit...Danny Elfman's music was at worst as well...No wonder it sucked...Tim Burton didn't even right the script !!! Tim burton for some reason wanted to take a very ""tim burton""-like story and make it into a wanna-be chronicles of narnia, with cute family scenes, pixar-like cgi instead of realistic looking models, and unexpected cheesiness throughout the film with rather dumb family humor as opposed to the dark crude humor of CATCF. It was not at all another psychedelic brilliant burton film, but a walt Disney kids cgi disaster.. JD is my FAVORITE actor and yet this was the worst acting i'd ever seen by him...his character was visually stunning and very memorable, but altogether it was very poorly done...the Disney cartoon was much more epic and well thought out... None, reapeat: NONE of the characters were creepy or highly imaginable, but stupid and annoying...I'm also a huge fan of Helena Bonham Carter and her acting was terrible as well as Anne Hathaway (who literally made me want to leave the theater when she flailed her arms around)..."
"hte-trasme","7","4","8","7 March 2010"," Is this the real ""Alice?""
","Almost needless to say, the visual elements of this new film version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" were extraordinarily impressive. In many senses, they go hand in hand with the original writing elements that have been worked into this version of the original story. Tim Burton is an extremely creative gentleman, and he has spun the materials of Lewis Carroll's story into a an incredibly rich visual world. Listing the things that look great would amount to trying to name almost everything in the movie.<br/><br/>Now, what goes on in this impressive created world is just as hard to get a hold of, for different reasons. The now-adult Alice is very conveniently modern in her tone as she rejects her family's insistence on corsets and arranged marriage, to a slightly irritating degree. Mia Wasikowska is great and projects a lot of power and personality in the role even though often she doesn't get too much to say beyond repeatedly insisting that she is in a dream. In fact, the arc of the story, in which Alice first insists on non-violence and making her own destiny only to give in to being a Jabberwocky-slayer according to her destiny, and then leaves wonderland in order to triumphantly... go into business is a little dissatisfying.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has had his role as the Mad Hatter, now a revolutionary leader, designed to headline him. He's a capable actor who makes strong choices and follows through on them completely -- but sometimes his choices are so odd and unsympathetic that his effectiveness is all but lost. This verges on one of those times. The real star of the show is Helena Bonham Carter who is brilliantly petulant, heartless, funny, and somehow evilly charming Red Queen.<br/><br/>The eccentric black humor that shows up here is great and mischievously funny. Sadly, though, it doesn't always show up. This is a grim version of the story, and many scenes are more serious than funny. This leaves them a little empty when we haven't really invested yet in the characters that this seriousness is based around. ""Alice and Wonderland"" really does need the sense of fun and humor that the original was essentially made of.<br/><br/>There are plenty of flaws to this big-budget spectacular version of a lighthearted children's book, but the strengths are often so relentlessly impressive that it's still an experience that it's tough to imagine regretting."
"ccthemovieman-1","5","6","14","10 June 2010"," Disapppointing, Considering The Hype
","Wow, now I understand all the negative reviews here at IMDb. I'd have to agree with most of the folks here; this film was very disappointing.<br/><br/>Yeah, being a Tim Burton film I knew I'd see some wild visuals with crazy characters but even those were nothing that special and grew tiresome after an hour.<br/><br/>In fact, the whole film started to drag after an hour, probably because the story was so poor. I found it uninvolved; I just didn't care about these characters, and I should have. Burton took Lewis Carroll's famous story and made it too dark and unlikable. It's not the first time he's done something like this.<br/><br/>It might also be time for Johnny Depp to take off all the eyeliner and assorted makeup and begin to do more mature roles. Yeah, I know: craziness is part of his ""schtick,"" but the guy just turned 47 years of age. As he did in ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Public Enemies,"" he can play characters that don't always look ""Willy Wonka""-like bizarre. The same goes for Burton, who seems to have gone one-too-many of the same thing. His writing and directing in this one lacks the outrageous fun he had in so many of his earlier efforts. Being over 50 doesn't mean his brain stops, but he needs to re-focus his creativity.<br/><br/>This film offers no heart-and-soul and is sorely lacking in the humor department. Burton's comedic films (i.e. Big Fish, Ed Wood, Bettlejuice, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"") seem to fare much better. Why make this famous children's story so dark? I'm sorry but I was equally unimpressed with ""Alice,"" played by newcomer Mia Wasikowska. After seeing her in ""Defiance"" and ""Amelia,"" I expected more out of her in this one. With a lot more feeling, she could have half-salvaged this film.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the film is slightly less than ""fair"" and much less when you consider the hype and the expectations most of us had."

He played the Mad Hatter wonderfully. Helena Bonham Carter stole the show as the Red Queen, in my opinion. The White Queen, Doormouse, White Rabbit and Cheshire cat were likable and played very well.

","Let me start off by saying has anyone ever read both Alice books written by Lewis Carol? If you have not, then the comparison that some make to the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and calling the ""Queen of Hearts"" the ""Red Queen"" has not read those books.<br/><br/>Like in any adaptation, the source material is just the blue print to build the house on; and there is going to be a change in it when it gets to the site to be built. Well the same goes for the Alice in Wonderland.<br/><br/>This Movie is not for children it is for older children. If your child had a problem seeing ""Coroline"", then this movie is not for the little ones. This movie is pure Burton at his finest! With all of the whimsical, Gothic humor and noir.<br/><br/>There are many reviewers that dispatch this movie to the trash, but they either have not read neither of the books nor have understood that to be silly and to be part of a world that does not make sense Is what makes this movie what it is. Like in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when Mike T.V. says that what he seeing does not make sense Charlie says (paraphrasing) it is not supposed to make sense after all that is what candy is. <br/><br/>Don't try to over think through every frame, but take it as a good story being told by a master story teller through glasses of Gothic noir. Oh yes, if you see it in 3D be careful with the little ones, there are some sequences that, as true to form for Burton, there are at times creatures that come up ""at your face"". Other than that little bit of warning, grab on to your our popcorn and get ready for a wondrous ride through Wonderland (Underland, see the movie and you will know) Yes, Jonny Depp he is the Mad Hatter after all he is supposed to be mad and zany even with orange hair."

I had been looking forward to this movie for a while, and a couple of weeks ago I found out that the movie differed a bit from the original story. At first, I wasn't very happy about this. But leading up to watching the film, I prepared myself for a different story. I went with a friend who wasn't informed about this, and didn't like it as much. I think the thing about this movie is: if you are expecting something along the lines of the original movie, don't bother. If you go in seeing it as a stand-alone film based in a fantasy-world, you will enjoy it much more."
"meeza","6","6","14","6 March 2010"," Meeza in Punderland writes about the awful ""Alice in Wonderland""
","Director Tim Burton's long-awaited film adaptation of ""Alice in Wonderland"" is finally here! And ouch! What a disappointment! Unfortunately, Alice is malice in boringland. We all know the trippy story of ""Alice in Wonderland"" so I will devoid this review the Wonderland narrative (Google: ""Lewis Carroll book"" in case you want to be reminded of it). The visually stunning and conceptually enthralling movie somehow had too much pot I mean plot to give me a cinematic high. Burton inserted way too many pseudo-eccentric characters in the flick for one to really get absorbed in their wonderland. I wonder why? Let's just say the movie's Cheshire Cat, Dormouse, March Hare, Blue Caterpillar, Bayard, White Rabbit (didn't I go there a couple of years ago for my bachelor party), and Tweedledee & Tweedledum (contrary to popular belief, not played by George Bush & Dick Cheney) did not do it for me. But the character I wanted to white out the most from the screen was the lackluster White Queen; probably had something to do with Anne Hathaway's asinine performance as the pale one. No, I am not going mad- I have not forgotten The Mad Hatter! My jury is still out on The Mad Hatter but let's just say I was expecting more of a charismatic Hatter character from the eccentric thespian maestro Johnny Depp. Mr. Hatter was captivating at first but after a while Depp's ""more of the same"" performance became more of a persistent hat trick that did not achieve its gravitating goal. I must say that the villainous bigheaded Red Queen was my favorite character in the movie due to her grandiose livid reactions expressed in that petite frame, priceless! Helena Bonham Carter's performance as the Red Queen might just get her a red carpet trip as a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominee at next year's Oscars. OK, maybe not, but Bighead Red did red-rock. Oh, and there is that Alice chic. Mia Wasikowska's starring performance as Alice was as lifeless as acting could be. Her sterile & immobile characterization of Alice made one wish that Alice would shoot down a few shots of Tequila & some Red Bulls in Boogie Wonderland in order to enliven her up! I wonder what hypnotic drugs Linda Woolverton was taking (or for that matter not taking) when she scribed up the unnecessarily-complex adapted screenplay based on a children's tale that is ""Alice in Wonderland"". The Art Direction, Cinematography, and Visual Effects of the movie were its strong suits, and do merit high praise. But that is not enough to give ""Alice in Wonderland"" a storybook-ending favorable review. ** Needs Improvement"
"MovieZoo","5","6","14","5 March 2010"," Alice In Wonderland: Take it or leave it, sadly
","Prior to the movie, I was still holding onto hope. I had read the complaints about Alice In Wonderland. After the movie all I can add is confusion. This is what happens when you feel disdain and admiration. Thankfully the feelings are separated distinctly To cover my butt, I am starting off with what some may consider spoilers. You decide.<br/><br/>***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS***** 3D or not 3D: I opted for the 3D version. What I feared from 3D is that the special attention to 3D might interfere with the attention to story and acting. THat indeed happened. While, for the most part, 3D was done well, so many times, the intricacies which should dazzle were too flittery and fast and sometimes fuzzy so it was not used to the best of its ability. But the staples were used in terrific fashion. Depth, color, stationary backgrounds, and normal motion fit well into the 3D scheme of things, however. So I am guessing that the non-3D version may have a definite advantage over 3D. Given all that, I am sure if you have half a notion, you will still want to see it in 3D if possible. So go, but be forewarned.<br/><br/>Acting: Depp and Carter were beautiful. Mia Wasikowska played an excellent Alice but I think her character was so distorted by Burton's darker desires that it will soon be forgotten who did play Alice. On the other hand, Depp and Carter were so absurd and colorful as Mad Hatter and Red Queen they immediately drew my respect and admiration. However, the Red Queen was the only one of those two characters that I felt remained most closely relevant while Mad Hatter often reminded me of Depp's flaky Jack Sparrow thanks to unforeseen feistiness in some scenes. That takes me back to why I was not too happy with Alice - didn't like the warrior in armor scene at all. As for Glover and Hathaway, neither offered much talent. Hathaway's quirkiness as the White Queen was just too unappealing.<br/><br/>Story: I so wish the story was the original Alice and not a sequel of sorts. While it was definitely Burton's story it was not a great story at all. Again, making Alice a warrior was not what I, personally, wanted to see. Characters seemed too self absorbed. Fast paced humor came and went but only would have worked well if there was enough time to feel some endearment to the character.<br/><br/>Overall: Right down the middle because things felt way too fragmented. I will say that I am thankful that the job of bringing book-true Alice In Wonderland was not given to Burton but I hope we get a version that looks as good artistically as this one did and then some.<br/><br/>5 out of 10"

","I've no one really to blame but myself. I've always thought Burton was vastly overrated and found nothing remotely entertaining in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory but, hey, let's give him another try, he can't go on being pretentious, can he? Within a couple of reels I had that old feeling that the actors were working in different movies. The lack of plot didn't help any more than the lack of charisma and/or acting ability in the leading lady. I looked in vain for something positive, some scintilla of style, some fragment of enjoyment/pleasure to take away from the screening. Alas, there was naught for my comfort.

"darin-wissbaum","4","5","11","5 April 2010"," Visuals are there but not the acting...
","Tim Burton is one of the most talented visual directors in the business (next to the great Stanley Kubrick) and whenever he makes a new film you can bet on a truly visual experience. Alice in Wonderland is no exception to this but unfortunately that is where it ends. Burton it seemed spent way too much time on perfecting the visuals in the film that he forgot about the actors. Johnny Depp can certainly hold his own in any film but his performance as the Mad Hatter was less than impressive for an actor of his caliber. He was more interesting to look at than to watch act and what made it worse was at the end he does this ridiculous break dance which for me just took more away from the story. And speaking of this classic and what I remember from it, Alice was more of an upbeat likable character that made you feel for her. Mia Wasikowska performance as Alice was the cure for insomnia. Her portrayal as Alice was one dimensional and expressionless which was surprising when you consider the enchanting place she finds herself in. She just delivered her dialog like she was bored to tears. And I can't understand the need for Burton to use Helena Bonham carter as the bad queen. I mean I know his is married to her in real life but she was mis-cast and she overacted. I would have preferred say Glenn Close for the part or some other actress that could have brought more to the role. Not only was the acting bad in this film but there were also several characters that in my opinion were a little on the creepy side, and that might scare kids. Tweedledee and Tweedledum are an example. They looked like something you would see in your worst nightmare.<br/><br/>Aside from the poor acting the visuals again were wonderful and maybe for some that would be worth the price of admission. Not for me."

Half reading books he doesn't understand, he tells himself that he does and stuffs his creation with liberal untruths, unmorals and unvirtuous preachings because the original author's genius escapes him completely.<br/><br/>I am not even talking about the fact that the transvestite looking Hathaway was completely eclipsed by the true beauty of Bonham Carter even despite the grotesque head. Of course that wasn't what the movie was trying to condition into its audience. 3-Dimensional experience of entirely 2-Dimensional characters was a key factor to making this film utter boredom and even Helena's efforts (the only person who tried) could not salvage this shipwreck.

"agmoldham","4","5","11","11 March 2010"," Not one of Burton's better films
","Most people will be aware of the Alice in Wonderland story, but this latest film by Tim Burton takes place with a grown up Alice. Alice is facing some tough decisions in the real world when she falls down the rabbit hole into the mysterious world below.<br/><br/>The film is unmistakeably a Tim Burton film, but it isn't really up to the quality of his best films in my opinion. The biggest draw back is that you don't really feel any empathy with the characters. I have been trying to work out the reason for this and have a feeling it may have something to do with it being a 3d film. There are various sequences which showcase the 3d technology with creatures jumping out of the screen. The problem with this is that these shots are virtually always irrelevant to the plot. The film doesn't have a good flow and I get the feeling that if it was edited to remove the '3d effects' and extend the dialogue in the key scenes it would be far more satisfying.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go as far as to say this was a bad film, but I feel it should have been better. You could probably watch any five minute sequence of the film and you'd be craving to see the rest of it. The only trouble is that after watching the rest of it you'd probably wish you'd stuck to watching 5 minutes."

I did like the young lady who played Alice though and felt that she has a nice fresh look that doesn't exactly fit in with the so called ""glamour"" of Hollywoodland. The acting by all the big names was forced and un fun to watch. Ann Hathaway just gets worse and worse to look at. I am serious, take a real look at her strangely shaped head and face in every movie she is in and you will admit that she is frightening to look at. That doesn't include the princess role (number one only). And Crispin Glover could have been just a little more weird as he is well known for off key roles.

","Tim Burton has never failed me. When he creates something I know what to expect, sometimes its evil, and sometimes is just fun. Think of a children's movie with a slight edge. I have a few problems with this movie, the first of them being the title. It is in fact not the same Alice in Wonderland story you all hope to seem it is in fact the second story, Through the Looking Glass. Its a bit darker than the original, but it is highly kid friendly.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie does seem to lack a bit in 3D effects, however it was totally worth it in my opinion, wouldn't watch it in 2D again if given the choice.<br/><br/>And lastly the White Queen, she is supposed to be dainty, however she comes across as awkward and robotic.<br/><br/>As far as the other characters go, Alice grew on me quite fast, she is a bit off-putting. Love the Mad Hatter and the door mouse. The red queen (as Helen always is) is fabulously funny and not too annoying as some bad guys tend to be. The knight could have been better, but his part is not so big it would effect my opinion or rating. Love the tweedles and the caterpillar.<br/><br/>The CGI is fabulous as well, i was not put off by it in any way, it seemed to fit in flawlessly with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I love this movie, gonna buy it when it comes out and may see it in the theater again. If you know the story and if you know Tim Burton or just one or the other, you should know this is a great movie, but don't judge it unless you see it for what it is, a family friendly PG rated, slightly dark but light movie."

","With Tim Burton written all over this imagining of the world of 'Alice in Wonderland' you know what you're in for, and the director doesn't fail to deliver the familiar atmosphere and traits that his fans or even casual movie goers have come to recognise. With a range of quirky characters and curious concepts to incorporate into his cinematic vision, Burton has created a surreal experience that is both brave and bold. In this departure from the original story, Alice (great casting in Mia Wasikowska) returns to Wonderland, where she is recruited to end the Red Queen's reign of terror. With help from old friends such as the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp in a quality turn), Alice gradually begins to rise to the challenge.<br/><br/>Although the title of the film may prove misleading to those expecting a fresh adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic, audiences are likely to benefit from a less familiar and therefore less predictable story. With your anticipation heightened by uncertainty, 'Alice in Wonderland' should prove an immersing experience, from the stunning visual craft to the intriguing encounters with famous Wonderland inhabitants. I found myself comparing it to a video game, as Burton appeared to draw out sequences in which Alice would attempt to find a logical solution to a problem, encouraging viewers to think as the protagonist; while the film is an assault on the senses, it also stimulates them.<br/><br/>If any fault is to be found in the film, in my opinion the blame would lay on the story. The mysterious nature of the primary character and the bizarre nature of those who support her don't provide a sufficient connection with the audience, making it harder than it should be to support them, a weakness emphasised by show-stealing sidekicks and a well-played villain courtesy of Helena Bonham Carter. Alice's meetings with influential characters such as the caterpillar and the cat, along with her attendance at the Mad Hatter's tea party, can initially break the film into segments and leave the feature feeling disjointed before the central plot arc comes into play. The quality of each of these scenes, however - featuring great characterisation and playing on the mythology of Wonderland as it is slowly unveiled to us - make up for any lack of a smooth transition between them.<br/><br/>Overall, slightly older youngsters should get the most out of the comedy involved with the characters and their situations without being unsettled by the more frightening scenes and imagery, whereas those who aren't amused can explore the symbolism, themes and literary features revisited in Alice's latest adventure. If you're in to weird, get in to Wonderland.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Precisely twenty years ago, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp had their first cooperative experience in cinema, the result of this team work was the pretty uncommon and extraordinary fairytale ''Edward Scissorhands''. After they made a lot of successful movies together, they decided to turn the clock back and make another mind-blowing fairytale. This time in their field sights was Lewis Carol's story ''Alice in Wonderland'', if you have ever pondered about the candidate for directing such a movie I think the answer would be obvious - Tim Burton! Apparently nobody else could re-create the same atmosphere on screen that was created by Lewis Carol in his legendary book. Evidently, his old friend and vivid actor Johnny Depp always imbued his films with bright colours and inimitable style. Finally, after many thrilling months, we got opportunity to see their version of ''Alice in Wonderland''.<br/><br/>At first view everything seems to be great. There are terrific visual effects, an exceptionally detailed world and plenty of unique characters that we all loved while reading the Lewis Carol book. We can see the amusing twins Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the kind White Rabbit, bombed grub Caterpillar, the evildoers Red Queen and Knave of Hearts, bloodthirsty Jabberwock, the mysterious Cheshire Cat and a remarkably well performed Mad Tea-Party with Doormouse, March Hare and Mad Hatter. <br/><br/>But Tim Burton's picture has a strong lack of insanity and lack of a firmly funkadelic environment intrinsic to the overblown Lewis Carol's world. His Gothic, grotesque and black humour disappeared also. This was the main disadvantage of the film, many thought it resembled ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' rather then the ''Edward Scissorhands'' calibre, though it was expected due to obvious reasons. The primary reason being the unwanted influence of Disney which always restricts a wide spectrum of Tim Burton's ideas. Its no wonder that we got what we got. Tim Burton can't be blamed for an incomplete job, taking into account his dependence on Disney we can assume he gave it all he could.<br/><br/>The acting was decent but not awesome. It's hard to acknowledge but Johny Depp is getting older and his acting skill rapidly running low. His acting wasn't as innovative as it used to be. Instead of a true Mad Hatter he just showed Jack Sparrow in a red wig and made-up face. Mia Wasikowska also wasn't the best choice for the Alice role. Her acting style just doesn't fit with the real Alice character and besides, she hasn't got enough acting experience to play the part effectively. The only one really stunning bit of acting was demonstrated by Helena Bonham Carter who played Red Queen. As for the rest, acting didn't impress me at all.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I should admit that this work isn't as great as was expected. We had already got used to the fact that Tim Burton was a reliable director who never failed his fans, but this time he just made a normal picture for a single viewing. This would be a good result for any typical and ordinary director but a serious misfortune for a high level master like Tim Burton. He definitely should stop tangling with such companies as Disney otherwise he seriously risks to become a simple commercial director without his own vein."
"Cucumber_Head","1","2","3","20 March 2017"," Worst than Awful
","This movie is so bad it shouldn't motivate anyone to take time and write something about it. But, I see it scores above 6 in IMDb and I ain't doing anything important so.. OK, why not? <br/><br/>First, what led me to watch this just now. I knew this wasn't a very good movie because, similar to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this had ""Tim Burton butchered a classic"" all over it. Interesting enough, while in Charlie and... he was making something bad over a great classic motion picture that had nothing to do with the project, this time around he is doing it for the same company (Walt Disney). Second, what led me to watch the movie. I purchased a 10 ""reais"" (about 3 bucks) edition of the original story by Lewis Carroll, which also included the Looking Glass bit and an Intro where some kind of book scholar meddles for several pages about how good and interesting these two tales are for children and also adults. The children part I am not so sure because the Alice story doesn't make any sense and in many parts its hard to understand (Carroll frequently changes words so they don't really exist in any dictionary and makes up poems which aren't suppose to say or mean anything). Anyway, the story is pleasant enough even though I am reading it around 150 years after it was first published. Its worth something because of Carroll's creativity in stirring illogical puzzles in a children's make believe fantastic world. In other words, it kind of make you feel like you are inside an awesome dream.<br/><br/>Disney's animation on the book is good, despite changing a few details and including characters and stories from ""the other side of the looking glass"". It is good, mainly because it preserves the essence of what one kind find when reading the book, like I have.<br/><br/>Finally, the Tim Burton movie. It is simply appalling. They (Tim Burton and his team or whoever made this happen the way it did) tore the story from the book to pieces and made some kind of Hollywood formula that always works. That worst of it all is that it seems to work, because it made money and now they have concluded a Looking Glass version (second movie on Alice) which makes no sense, because in the first one they have already included characters from both stories (and more that wasn't three of course). <br/><br/>The plot is lame to say the least: Alice doesn't want to marry some rich kid that looks awful so she runs away after a rabbit and falls in a hole. After falling violently, she finds herself in a strange world where there are fantastical creatures. Soon she learns that everyone knows her in this world, and most don't believe she is the same Alice. Up to this part it is all interesting enough and things could maybe be mended into an OK flick but check what ends up happening. Alice teams up with a beast that almost ripped her arm apart and that serves no purpose to the story except that he's the guardian of a mystical sword. So, like in Matrix, Alice is the chosen one and she supposedly will save everyone by killing a hideous monster (dragon looking beast) by use of the special sword. Meanwhile, the queen of hearts hates everyone but specially her sister, which is the white queen, and also a ""I love all living things"" hypocrite douche-bag. Crispin Glover plays some sort of dark knight that is queen of heart's favorite handy man to do all her dirty work. <br/><br/>So, with these information one might foresee everything that will happen. To populate this misery of a plot, there are about three characters that at least have something to do with the book: the Cheshire cat, which is magical and can do anything to steer the story to any direction he likes, no questions asked; the Hatter, that is this movie's Captain Jack Sparrow or Willy Wonka or a blend of both (maybe not as important to the story but with the same entertaining purpose); and the blue caterpillar, which, I think, its in the movie so that the audience might think that there are more bits from the original story. <br/><br/>The whole think is just too formulaic, the acting is bland, Depp almost achieved making whoever is watching vomit with his bizarre moves (including his happy happy joy joy dance) and facial expressions. Lead actress is mildly charming, but her performance overall very subtle and uninteresting. Helena Carter made something interesting with her queen, and Glover likewise with his knight. And except for some very descent voice acting, everyone else is forgettable just like this movie. Or not.. But I'll probably only remember this movie because it was so painful to watch (and because I reviewed it here), like that moment when you realize you tore your ACL and from now on you'll just have to deal with it."
"gloriahur","5","2","3","22 October 2016"," Boring and Meaningless
","The visual effects are great, as all Tim Burton movies are. Beautiful colors, costumes, etc. The story should have been based more on the original tale, and not make up some meaningless battle between the pretty queen and the ugly queen. The plot is obstinate and the action is not at all exciting.<br/><br/>The characters are actually interesting and distinctive, each dressed beautifully. But they don't seen very related to each other, maybe because of the unique characteristics but there are no elements that makes the viewer tie them as actual ""friends"" or ""team"". The most friendly character is actually the bandersnatch. AND Alice always orders everyone to do everything for her and is very selfish.<br/><br/>The story then goes on very slowly without any exciting thing happening, except for some parts where the Red queen acts silly. She's my second favorite character. After all, everyone hates her and she needs mental treatment, not be banished to some scary place. Anyways, the story continues on until Alice successfully kills the Jabberwocky with her weak arm power and saves the cheeky White queen. Actually, it was the Cheshire cat who was the real hero. Then, Alice leaves and she succeeds in not marrying Hamish and feeding her family."

"diogenes-858-449167","7","2","3","15 December 2011"," PG? Have you checked the children?
","Tim Burton applies his usual relish to this story. The execution is excellent in all departments, except it's not a movie for children.<br/><br/>It's not a movie for a lot of adults either. Burton brings Alice's adventure(in fact the story is the residue of Lewis Carrol's lsd trips) to life in what closely resembles Gothic horror. Burton's wonderland characters are demented, mutant humans and circus freaks, and frightening animals that talk. If I were a child watching this I would feel affronted, horrified and disempowered. Having said that, I think it's hilarious that Disney asked Burton to direct this demented children's tale. I doubt that Mr & Mrs Average will trust Disney with their children again. The violence is powerful. Wonderland's sinister atmosphere is thorough. The questionably redeeming allegories and truisms of the original story are lost in this fiercely frightening version. The Red Queen's three face slaps on her consort are tremendously violent. The realisation of the Jabberwocky is goth monsterism at its nastiest. The original story Lewis Carrol weaved with words, engaged children's imagination. Burton's film realisation leaves no where for young minds to retreat to. Don't let them see this. Share it with your least favourite in-law, and laugh uproariously throughout it."
"nickmesafilms","9","2","3","10 November 2011"," Alice in Wonderland (2010) - It's a ""Movie-Land"" Spectacular Here at ""Wonder-Land""!
","Director Tim Burton is the perfect person to arrange a movie like this where he brings his own vision to the magical, colorful world of ""Alice in Wonderland"". I must say that I am impressed with this wonderful piece of work. This movie takes place, years after the original Disney animated classic, when Alice is 19 years old and can hardly remember the childhood memory of Wonderland, until she falls into the rabbit hole once again, where all the beloved surroundings and faces of Wonderland are met once again. ""Alice in Wonderland"" is by far one of the best movies of the year for many reasons. First, we have a magnificent, and charming vision brought to the screen by the wacky mind of Tim Burton, and the cast is pure gold to watch. Johnny Depp stole the whole show as the witty, charming, and extremely weird and crazy Mad Hatter. Helena Bonham Carter is hilariously enjoying as the Red Queen, Anne Hathaway is wonderful and beloved, Matt Lucas plays a brilliant two-character performance(s) as both Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Then, newcomer Mia Wasikowska is perfect and wonderful as Alice, with a lot of her charming charisma. Also, I was blown away throughout the movie by the breathtaking special effects, the colorful costumes, the memorable characters, the wonderful art direction, and the incredible story. I thought it all worked perfectly, in such a creative way. ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a beautiful re-telling of Lewis Carrol's beloved children's story, and Tim Burton was the perfect director to put it all together. ""Alice in Wonderland"", in my review, ""a beautiful and wonderful cinematic masterpiece of the year""."
"thinker1691","7","2","3","13 June 2010"," "" If you look closely at a mirror you will realize it has more than one reflection ""
","Charles Dodgson wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll and his imaginative books have been christened by the world of literature as Classics. His most famous and enduring work written in 1865 is called "" Alice in Wonderland "" which by the way is the title of this movie. Although read mostly by young literary students, this particular film has a dark, shadowy, foreboding environ meant for adult audiences. Carroll's original story is of a twelve-year-old girl named Alice who follows a white rabbit down into a strange nonsensical world full of odd assortment of creatures. This latest version is decidedly updated from it's original synopsis. The original Walt Disney film had Kathryn Beaumont as Alice with Sterling Holloway as the Cheshire Cat. Now we have Tim Burton directing this more somber offering, with Mia Wasikowska playing Alice. Johnny Depp is the Mad Hatter with Stephen Fry as the disappearing Cat and Alan Rickman is recognized as the voice of the Caterpillar. The menacing Jabberwacky is played by accomplished character actor Christopher Lee. Attemping to forget the original and focusing on this 2010 version, one finds it interesting, assertive and whimsical. The fast background scenery is fantastically creative and more importantly action driven. The Idea of a mature, 18 year old warrior Alice is difficult to comprehend as she is not only to be married, but forced to accept a social standing and offered a traveling business venture as well. It's far from Carroll's original concept. Nevertheless, it's a movie for any who desires to join Alice in the modern world and far from the Looking Glass where she began. ****"
"kimberlyj_kelley","7","2","3","4 June 2010"," Awesome, but could use improvement
","Okay, for the record, I liked this movie. Now, I didn't like everything about it. However, overall, I did.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I have not yet read the original Alice in Wonderland stories. (I was sad when I saw the end of the Lord of the Rings since I knew how it really ended). Or maybe it's because I normally dislike Tim Burton's movies since I find them too disturbing (yeah, I know, shocker.) Maybe it's because I could see what the screenwriter was trying to do with this movie since I, too, have a screen writing background. Because, you see, her interpretation of the story was supposed to be different; this is Alice 13 years after the original story takes place.<br/><br/>So with that in mind - since I am not a Lewis Carroll purist and am typically not a Tim Burton fan - please consider what I have to say.<br/><br/>I do agree that the story was predictable. Alice gets told she is to kill the Jabberwocky, she fights this idea throughout the movie, but in the end she decides to go ahead, find the courage, and do as prophecied. I know - that seems boring and unexciting. I also agree that Mia Wasikowski's performance needed some fine-tuning; I cringed a bit when she did the fudderwhacken for her father's business partner at the end. It was totally unnecessary, and for me did not add anything to the story.<br/><br/>However, I believe this story was about finding courage to be more than what you have been told you are. And I can tell you from personal experience: self-doubt is not an easy place to be. So, to me, the way Mia portrayed Alice's struggle with her self-confidence and her own doubts about Wonderland being real, thinking it was yet again a dream, was spot on. I appreciate this actress for her great showing of tough emotions that are normally hard to get across on screen. I think some of her ""wooden"" acting, as people are claiming it to be, was really her way of showing her character's doubts and lack of courage. So I do see promise in this particular actress. She is young, after all, and I think she'll grow and mature in her weaker areas.<br/><br/>What I also liked was the fact that these well-loved characters were more true to life than before. I may not know what they were like originally, and I will concede that I am ignorant on that. But I could see that Tim Burton was paying homage to the original Disney version of the movie and trying to ground each of them in reality. I liked seeing the Red Queen having a softer, more vulnerable side (on her rare occasions), and in those times she reminded me more of Queen Elizabeth than the Queen of Hearts. I also liked Anne Hathaway's touch of the White Queen also appearing mad in various places in the movie. Now, I can't fully trust the White Queen to be a good queen to Wonderland, since she did seem calculating and mechanical in most of her scenes. And I do agree that I hated how Hathaway kept carrying her arms in that awkward ballet position; Hathaway is more graceful without all of the arm dramatics. But I could see what Hathaway was getting at with her performance.<br/><br/>Basically, what I am trying to say is that there is more depth and realness in this movie - alongside the amazing visual effects - than one would first expect. And that is another reason to go see this movie.<br/><br/>I will concede that there were definite goofs in this movie, primarily in some of the acting. Johnny Depp is hilarious, but in this movie he seemed to be repeating some of the same things he did in Willy Wonka. Wrong movie. And while I normally like Anne Hathaway's movies, I would have preferred someone else playing the White Queen. I also wondered what the heck the scriptwriter was thinking with Lord of the Rings and Narnia homages here and there (like the dead faces in the water near the castle, or some of the same actors from the same movies - like Chris Lee as the jabberwock and Marton Csokas as Alice's father). This story should have been something from its own making.<br/><br/>But, here's the thing. Wonderland IS a fabulous, visual fantasy, and Helena Bonham Carter's acting blew me away. I saw this movie for a second time yesterday, and lots of people in the auditorium clapped at the end. There must have been something they liked, as I did."
"dfwforeignbuff","9","2","3","3 June 2010"," Burton Delivers but generic CGI ending. Depp is Magnificent 4 stars
","Alice in Wonderland 2010. Some called this a ""bold"" Lewis Carol I just call it Tim Burton. He is visually bold always. Some were expecting more than the fairy tale as if he would invent a new story or Alice in Wonderland ""world"" (like Cameron did in Avatar). No don't expect too much this is still the standard tale of Alice we all grew up with. However it is with Burton's typically dark & adult slant. Maybe this was not mean as a children's tale. Plot: Having grown up & grown a sense of responsibility, Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to the rabbit hole where her Wonderland once appeared. This time she has a political motive to overthrow the despotic rule of the autocratic Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). To accomplish this, Alice must garner support for the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) & eliminate the Jabberwocky (Christopher Lee) & end the state terrorism. At least this is the determination of a Blue Caterpillar (Alan Rickman) & the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry). Alice must enlist the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) to her cause, though he seems shell-shocked by the antics of the Red Queen & her henchman Stayne, the Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover). Burton's unique & enjoyable visual version gives us Carroll's characters as distinctive as the original illustrations. The people in Wonderland seem to be made particularly obnoxious by Burton. (which I enjoyed!) The film works well until the end & then I hated all the action. What happened to a real storyline ending in film today?? Since this is a Disney film I expected a chain holding back Burton & we got that in the plot a very generic CGI battle ending. . Seems Disney's oversight kept this film with a much more commercial plot than many of Burton's films have been. Still it is a visually delightfully absurd & even quite violent & bloody movie. I enjoyed it a lot I have trouble accepting all the bad 2 & 3 star reviews. Its not a 5 star movie & its not bad. 4 for me!! I love Tim Burton films. Dep is magnificent in this film"
"dhaufrect-1","9","2","3","3 June 2010"," ""Alice without Malice""
","""Alice In Wonderland"" is a charming film that is now available on DVD and Blu Ray. It is Tim Burton's version of Lewis Carroll's classic novel by nearly the same name. I don't agree with the malice that is heaped upon this film by many critics. It is unjustified malice, and it fails to recognize the great genre of fantasy. Fantasy does, indeed, provide far more leeway for the director to experiment with his chosen field. The computer generated imagery seems to enhance the story rather than detract from its intentions.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives a very entertaining performance as the Mad Hatter. His facial expressions are truly unique to this exceptional actor. Mia Wasikowka plays a very convincing Alice, and her emotional roller coaster is well appreciated. Alan Rickman is the voice of the Blue Caterpillar. His voice in this film is worth the price of admission. Anne Hathaway portrays the White Queen in a believable performance. And Helena Bonham Carter does likewise for the Red Queen.<br/><br/>Despite the fantasy genre of this movie, it has scenes that might be frightening for the very young. It is a very slick film, and it is worth seeing for those who are young at heart."
"wolverinesforever","7","2","3","17 May 2010"," Okay entertainment; doesn't do much wrong, but doesn't do a lot right either.
","Okay, maybe I should check myself on that last statement. Visually, the film is quite impressive. The many different elements of Wonderland are wonderfully constructed, both with the CGI and the production design. Burton's always had a knack for creating visually interesting and imaginative movies, and you get that again here.<br/><br/>The cast mostly acquits themselves. We've come to expect Johnny Depp to play weird/out there roles, so his performance as the Mad Hatter is enjoyably nutty. And Helena Bonham Carter (another Burton regular) is quite good shifting from being villainous to darkly comical as the Red Queen.<br/><br/>What never really takes flight, however, is the story. While I was watching the film, I couldn't help but feel that Disney was telling Tim Burton what to do the whole time. When he's at his best (""Ed Wood,"" ""Big Fish,"" ""Sweeney Todd""), he can mix a bizarre and visually unique world with a close to home emotional journey with well-developed characters. Here, he has the world, but the story seems to be checking the plot points instead of taking on a journey of its own. Too often, Alice circles around her belief that ""it's just a dream"" while we, the audience, know otherwise. And speaking of Alice, while actress Mia Wasikowska sometimes shows the plucky courage necessary for the role, there are also moments where she is too stiff in her body language or underplays the scene that surrounds her.<br/><br/>Overall, I can only marginally recommend ""Alice in Wonderland."" The sets and CGI are top-notch, and some of the actors do well with their roles. But the story needs more life breathed into it and it needs to feel more organic rather than ""been here, done that."""
"Foux_du_Fafa","7","2","3","21 April 2010"," Return to Wonderland is good...until the Futterwacken dance
","In the umpteenth film version of Lewis Carroll's story, a 19 year-old Alice discovers a white rabbit with a waistcoat and a pocket watch whilst at a stuffy garden party. Following him down his hole, she finds herself in the topsy-turvy world of Underland, which she visited as a child thinking it was called Wonderland. The entire population seems to remember her, but Alice has no recollection of the place. More alarmingly, she is part of a prophecy that will end the nasty Red Queen's reign of terror, and all the strange characters are egging her on to help restore the good White Queen as ruler.<br/><br/>I was worried that I wouldn't really like Tim Burton's take on ""Alice in Wonderland"" for a variety of reason, mainly because of Linda Wolverton's potentially saccharine script, which in part seems to rip off ""Hook"" and ""Return to Oz"" (on paper, that is). The critical bashing also didn't exactly project greatness. Fortunately, I wasn't all that disappointed. Whilst the madness of Wonderland is relatively toned down, the film proved to be overall a winner. The computer effects are some of the best I have ever seen (I really hope that this will at least be nominated for a special effects Oscar), and there were some real winners in the cast, in particular Anne Hathaway as the White Queen.<br/><br/>However, the film is not without its problems. A number of plot points aren't highlighted very well (for example: who exactly ruled Underland/Wonderland when Alice went there as a child?), and the social mobility alluded to once Alice goes home, although positive, seems highly historically inaccurate. But the worst part of all is when the Mad Hatter does the Futterwacken dance after the Jabberwock has been slain. It seems like some executive forced Burton to have Johnny Depp do a funny break-dance for the children in the audience, and the whole sequence seems completely out of place.<br/><br/>Needless to say, ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a pleasant, fun-filled way to pass an hour or two, and comes recommended."
"StartingAllOver14","7","2","3","7 April 2010"," Much better than the reviewers gives credit for
","In spite of having to read many negative reviews, I was still curious to see this movie. I not a huge Burton fan neither, although I've enjoyed some of his previous work. But it was something about «Alice in Wonderland» which seemed appealing; it's visual look and it's quirky characters. Still I had in mind the several hostile reviews, which accused this movie to be a flat, soulless and muddled attempt of a classic, which I also feared it would. But after finally seeing the movie, I can claim my disagreement with the reviewers. In fact, I'm not sure if we even saw the same movie. What exactly was so terrible about it? <br/><br/>Overall, I found «Alice in Wonderland» to be very entertaining. I feared that the movie would loose some of it's magic as the main character entered to Wonderland, but fortunately it never did. I enjoyed the movie from the very start to it's very end. It's a cute fantasy/adventure movie, equal to the «Harry Potter» and the «Narnia» flicks (although I personally felt «Prince Caspain» had some slight weaknesses). But beware; there are some frightening creatures who may scare the youngest in the audience, so the PG rating is suitable.<br/><br/>One of the films biggest advantages is it visuals. With it lush and dark landscapes, cute animals and colorful costumes, the flick is beautifully to look at and I can't wait to enjoy the sharpness of the picture on Blu Ray. The score of Danny Elfman is effective and gives the movie a dreamy, atmospheric tone. The characters are mostly passable. They don't steal the show entirely, but neither do they appear as distractive or annoying.<br/><br/>Although I've always liked the original novel of Lewis Carroll, I must say that I found this new twist of the story fresh and creative, depicting the «wrong» Alice's adventures in Wonderland as a young adult. Linda Woolverton, who's behind the excellent screenplays for «Beauty and the Beast», «The Lion King» and «Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journplay», has written a solid and decent script to «Wonderland». Many has claimed this screenplay to be muddled and confusing, but I didn't felt it that way at all. Once again, did we even saw the same movie? <br/><br/>Mia Wasikowska is quite decent as Alice. Although she doesn't have a distinctive emanation/charisma who characterizes other young actresses at her age, she's still delivers a nice and acceptable performance. Personally I felt her screen presence expanded during the movie. Johnny Depp is indeed a good actor. To claim anything else, would be a like claiming that the climate isn't humid in the rain forest. Although I've never been crazy over Depp's work, he's goofy and great as The Mad Hatter, which is indeed the best character in the movie. Helena Bonham Carter is also believable and funny as the Red Queen (just prepare yourself to hear «Off with his head» at least a hundred times during the movie, ha ha). While Anne Hathaway, on the other hand, is warm and passable as the White Queen (although I must confess it was a little distracting to see her with a blonde wig and with a British accent).<br/><br/>In fact, I can't see anything wrong with this new Burton version of «Wonderland». I truly enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone as possible. It didn't deserved the negative criticism at all, in my opinion. With quality films like this, perhaps I could finally forgive Disney for it's recent mistakes? (*Cough, leaving hand drawn animation behind and promoting teen stars as crazy, cough*) <br/><br/>So follow every white rabbit you see and follow him to the hole... Wonderland is waiting..."

","Alice in Wonderland (2010)<br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Updated version of the Disney classic has teenager Alice (Mia Wasikowska) about to be forced into a lifeless marriage when she takes off running, falls into a hole and into Wonderland. There the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) has a mission for her and that's to bring the evil queen (Helena Bonhnam Carter) down and free (Anne Hathaway). I really wasn't sure what to expect from this film and when the end credits started I walked out of the theater with a take-it or leave-it feeling. This certainly doesn't match the animated film but at the same time I'm sure kids watching the story for the first time are really going to love what they see. For me the film just seemed to by the numbers as if Burton really didn't know where he wanted to go with the material. Everything is very beautiful on the eyes but a lot of the emotion seemed to be missing and the film really lacked any heart or soul. Out of all the Depp-Burton films I must admit that this was the first time I was disappointed with Depp. He certainly gives a good performance here but for the life of me I couldn't help but feel he got robbed by the screenplay that really didn't leave him much to do. In some ways I felt that Depp was a bit too good for this part and that the character was underwritten. I was also bored with Carter and her performance. Perhaps she's just been in too many of Burton's films but I didn't find any part of her character or performance to be entertaining. Even Hathaway's character is rather weak but the actress at least gives it her all. Wasikowska is the real reason this movie works as well as it does. I really couldn't take my eyes off of her and she did a marvelous job as Alice. I thought she gave an incredibly strong performance and I believed her every step of the way. She was cute, charming and fun which is exactly what the movie needed. Horror legend Christopher Lee lends his voice at the end of the film as well. The visuals here are very easy on the eyes but, again, without the heart of soul there's really not enough here to make it a winner."

","Ever since the teaser was released, I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Tim Burton's new movie, Alice in Wonderland. I was always excited to see new footage, photos, behind the scenes previews and the such presented to the public. And from that, I knew what to expect from what I've been waiting for for months.<br/><br/>Lewis Carroll wrote two amazingly brilliant books in the late 19th century which have captivated many generations, and is considered a classic throughout our cultures.<br/><br/>As for the movie, it was visually stunning. Sometimes it didn't seem as if the environment was CGI. It was dreamlike, to say the most. The detail they put into everything was beautifully rendered. I reckon they did a brilliant job.<br/><br/>It was lovely to see these whimsical characters on the big screen once again. The performances and voice acting was well done. Although Mia Wasikowska's portrayal of Alice may have seemed bland and wooden, I reckon she did a fine performance. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter was a treat, and a nice and interesting depiction for this hysterical, yet dark character. Helena Bonham Carter, in my opinion, stole the show with her hilariously wicked performance as the Red Queen. She was joyous to watch. And not to forget Anne Hathaway, who played the ethereal White Queen, who was surprisingly alright to say the least. The Knave, played by Crispin Glover, did a great job too. And the wondrously suave Cheshire Cat, played by the amazing Stephen Fry, really was one of the best things about the movie. And not to forget the March Hare, Absolom the Caterpillar, Tweedles, the White Rabbit and many other wondrous characters, who's voice actors did a terrific job.<br/><br/>The music was very Danny Elfman, and did create a wondrous atmosphere throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Likes aside, here are what I found to be not so wonderful: The story was weak, of course. It was rushed and lacked in parts. I wish they gave it more, like an extra half hour or so. Wasn't amazing, nor horrible, but wasn't great. It was okay, at least I was enthralled into the movie. Though, it was predictable and cliché, but I wouldn't let that be a bother. I wished too that they kept the wordplay from the books into the movie, to capture the essence of what made the books remarkable and extraordinary.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie for what it was: an entertaining ride. If there had been more time and a bit of a tidy up, in my opinion, it would've been breathtaking. Though, this is a movie you either love or hate. It is not one of Burton's greatest to date, but still, it is an enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>I give it an 8/10 (though, it would actually be a 7.5).<br/><br/>****/5 stars."
"olaginip","6","2","3","21 March 2010"," Burton's drop down the rabbit hole
","Like many before me, I must say I used to be a huge Burton fan. When it comes to the Burton/Depp thing, it's in my opinion that after both 'Ed'(Scissorhands/Wood) movies they quickly lost their old chemistry. They used to have something unique during that era. But unfortunately, they've(IMO)drifted away a bit too much, from what made them so unique. Like Charlie and the chocolate factory, Alice in Wonderland left me quite indifferent, nice visuals, above average acting, but it was quite shallow. Where the older characters, that Burton used, had a certain unique depth. The latter ones he chose to portray, ended up feeling like stereotypes.<br/><br/>And sadly that's what bothered me the most with his vision on Alice in Wonderland. It used to be a dream to have Burton take on 'Wonderland'. But having seen the actual movie, it ended up failing in almost every aspect. The story was rushed(typical Disney adventure crap), the characters ended up dull and wrongly used. And overall it didn't move me at all. The visuals were nice, but not amazing...<br/><br/>I grew up reading both original books, but after watching this movie, it's like everyone who didn't read the books, will believe in a completely different wonderland. It looked the same, but in the end it didn't feel the same. To me the only moments that really had the feel were Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole and the flashbacks. Sadly this is another uninspired, over advertised Burton movie(while it's actually a Disney movie).<br/><br/>The acting left me even more indifferent then the plot. Although there were some highlights. Like the march hare,the Cheshire cat,the queen of hearts and the hatter. There was a bit too much hatter, hilariously few of the hare, disappointingly few of the cat and definitely not enough of the red queen...<br/><br/>There was enough Alice, but she didn't really say or do much, even for someone believing to be stuck in a dream. And towards the ending she had hardly even changed(personally) at all...<br/><br/>The over-hyped hatter, was nice but there was no depth to his character, which was disappointing after hearing Depp and Burton constantly talking about their 'deeper' approach towards the character, which led me to believe there'd be a lot more to him...<br/><br/>It's not what it could've been, and with a story like the original, I can't understand how they simply took elements out of the books and mixed 'em up with elements out of recent cliché Disney adventure movies.<br/><br/>As a fan of the books, I'd give it a 5(maybe even overrated), but as a loosely adapted movie I'm prepared to give it a 6(the visual experience and at least some of the acting deserves it) But okay, I guess I(and many others I'm sure) will have to wait until someone has the courage once more to 'try' and bring this classic back to live... again..."
"xtian_durden","7","2","3","16 March 2010"," 8 stars, maybe because it's my first 3D experience..
","My first digital 3D experience, every scene fulfilled my visual fantasies. The dramatic visual effects take you so far into another world called ""Wonderland."" Technology is advancing everyday, every decade has its own stage and style. I can see the vast improvement of film making from watching the first feature length film watching the newest jaw-dropping films of today. I know that the technology in film will continue to improve even though it doesn't need any and despite the fact that it looks so perfect right now. What will be the new thing in watching a movie after 10 years, 20 years and 50 years from now? I can't imagine such additions. Johnny Depp, again, plays an interesting character in a Tim Burton picture, this time he is wearing Mad Hatter's costume. This is not an unusual character to him, and he is so used to playing this kind of role that he does not need any effort in acting, but the thing that caught my attention from the beginning was the make-up, they did a wonderful job on Carter's Red Queen too. Looking deeper into the film, I can see that it started and ended a bit fast, I think that that's what happened to Corpse Bride too. I craved for each character's personality and identity but it is so sudden that we don't get to know them much. It was a victorious ending in the Wonderland, but I didn't feel so victorious because it is not a surprise to us that Alice will be triumphant in the end. Maybe Tim Burton lacks emotional approach to his audiences. His tricks work in some cases, but all in all something is lacking and I needed a little a bit more. Summary: The story is good and usual, but in some areas ""Alice in Wonderland"" is lacking but not visually."
"minamizaki","8","2","3","15 March 2010"," You people are wrong, the CGI is average, the story is totally Tim Burton. Dark, quirky yet sweet
","I really like it. as 3D and CGI go, it's not extremely impressive. But I like how they rework the story (I know, it's not entirely logical, but it's a fantasy story, not a detective story, I can suspend my logics and reason for a moment). I like the humour,giddiness, irony, cynicism, there're certain moments where it's as comic as it's poignant. Although I find the ending a bit clumsy. And the Red Queen is awesome, very funny, there's never a dull moment when he's on screen.<br/><br/>But I've to say I'm slightly disappointed with Wonderland, it's not the most imaginative from Tim Burton, you feel you've already seen it in book illustrations. <br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score is OK, not very memorable."
"The_Fifth_Echo","6","8","21","4 March 2010"," A Visual Delight, But I expected way more.
","Going to theaters to watch Alice in Wonderland, I had very high expectations because of the people in it. The wonderful Tim Burton and Jhonny Depp partnering up again and that made me excited. (Their History together include classics such as Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow and etc.) I was also very excited for the two well respected Oscar-nominated Actresses (Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway) But most importantly is that I love Alice in Wonderland the book and the 1951 classic animated Disney feauture.<br/><br/>Anyways the movie review itself: I thought Alice in Wonderland looked beautiful and even breathtaking at times. You got to admit that the movie looked beautiful visually. But emotionally it didn't really connect and lost a lot of its heart to the original.I was very disappointed with Tim Burton, I thought that he knew what the movie should of been like. This is not Tim Burton's best at all. Hopefully in 10-15 years time, another remake of this movie will be created and hopefully it would be better.<br/><br/>Overall: Alice in Wonderland deserves a much better remake, but the movie itself was visually breathtaking and it was a really fun movie. 6.5/10"

"cardsrock","6","1","1","15 March 2020"," Visual splendor with a subpar story
","The odd decision to change so many elements from the original really hurt this live action remake. There is a serious lack of charm and the generic good vs evil kingdom story was not necessary.

Tim Burton knows how to fill the screen with wonderful imagery, if only he could've ironed out a better story."

"goolizap","8","1","1","11 May 2016"," Twizard Rating: 77
","The imagery of Wonderland is one that's notably psychedelic--almost notoriously--to the point where it's become a well-known pseudo-fact that author Lewis Carroll used drugs while penning his famous novel. This isn't true. But countless tellings of the story carry such traits.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's is no different. Although, while being adamant about his version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory not straying away from the original source material, his take on Wonderland differs quite a bit. But not in a bad way. In fact, this version is a refreshing new take on the classic story we all know. It would have been so easy to merely duplicate it, but Burton had something else in mind. <br/><br/>Unlike the other adaptations, especially including the 1951 Disney version, Burton tries to create an emotional connection between Alice and the characters she encounters. Instead of Alice going through Wonderland and experiencing a sequence of disjointed events, her journey is all connected, giving the film an actual sense of cohesion. <br/><br/>Starting off in the real world, 19-year-old Alice is on the verge of being forced into marrying some guy she doesn't love. The people around her parallel traits of the characters we already know from Wonderland, foreshadowing what's about to happen--in a sort of Wizard of Oz type of way.<br/><br/>Then, right when it's convenient, she follows an anthropomorphic white rabbit down a hole into Wonderland. Did I say Wonderland? I mean ""Underland"". ""Wonderland"" is the name she gives it when she's a little girl. Apparently this isn't Alice's first time here. But now that she's older, she insists it's always just been a dream. In fact, she says this about 10 times, and never seems to accept the reality of it all.<br/><br/>But the characters all seem to know her, insisting that she is prophesied to defeat the Red Queen's Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>The film takes awhile to get anywhere, and the dialogue does a lot of rambling. However, we still seem to enjoy Alice's adventures as though we are unfamiliar with the story ourselves.<br/><br/>Because, in a way, we are. But it's Burton's auteurism that draws us in the most. His actualized vision is what draws us in and gives this film its unique thumbprint.<br/><br/>Indeed dreamlike, Underland is a world all of its own. It's much like Wonderland, except many of the bright colors are gone. This is a ""Wonderland"" that doesn't juxtapose brightness with dystopian imagination. Because it's completely dark and dystopian in almost every way--which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Although, it may disappoint those hoping for a quintessential live- action adaptation.<br/><br/>What prevents this film from being great is its tendency to meander. Seeming to be more focused on its impenetrable lexicon and non-sequiturs, it feels, at times, like the filmmakers don't want us to know what's going on. And feeling like an outsider when a movie should be enveloping you in its highly intricate world can be a frustrating experience.<br/><br/>Filled with made-up words that even the most insane context clues won't help us with, it never lets up. As though it's proud of being cryptic. Or perhaps you can just credit it for its consistency. Whatever it is, at least it brings us closer to the title character in her own bemusement. <br/><br/>All is forgiven during the last 25 minutes when everything finally makes sense and we realize that the film actually does have some great ideas. But, it turns out, all it had to do was simply explain what itself.<br/><br/>The cast is all very good in their respective roles. Helena Bonham Carter is a marvel as the Red Queen, who acts as a spoiled child trapped in an insecure and manipulative dictator. Her head is oddly shaped, so her minions wear prosthetic noses and ears to make her feel more comfortable with her own distortions.<br/><br/>I'm glad there's a sequel about to come out, because I've always felt this film was more of a setup movie. And a good one, at that--just getting us accustomed to the world that's been created. A world that feels very real. <br/><br/>The film's occasional off-kilter humor is noticed and appreciated. It adds to the oddness of it all--much in line with the spirit of Lewis Carroll and his sober-self.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 77"

","A wonderland that is dreamy and funny and simply wonderful. A trip that we take on in dreams.<br/><br/>Alice has a dream and the whole story is a familiar story for most who have known it since childhood. But never have I seen it come off so wonderfully with exquisite costumes, art direction and the graphics that are so intrinsic. Once you have the whole feel of it, then each characters come across with a panache that is their own, be it a stalwart like Johnny Depp or a Anne Hathaway, all take the story forward in a way that is so engaging and also enticing. <br/><br/>The music took me in and was fantastic, it was aptly creepy at most times and it was thrilling too as the trip went on. The finale music is just a great one though the finale fell short of lot of my visual expectations. I must say the movie got dragged right when Alice met White Queen and since it started to loosen a grip on a suspense thriller it held to for thus long.<br/><br/>All performances were very very engaging and they all induced a character of their own and this appreciation goes to Burton for extracting such performances. <br/><br/>Burtonish and Johnny Deppish. It's 3/5. It is good for now but surely could have been a Wow had the finale been better and the movie been shorter."

","I found this film to be easy-going entertainment for a family afternoon of relaxation. Actor-spotting was fun, especially for the voice-only actors (Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, Babs Windsor, etc..) and I found it visually stimulating: expected from Mr Burton. I am a Depp fan and he delivered his usual quirky style, showing off another accent which I thought quite convincing, on the whole: but the whole film felt a little empty and shallow to me. It seemed to just meander along nicely without anything to really stimulate the emotions. We enjoyed it, but I doubt any of us will be wishing to watch it again. I'd like to give it a 6.5 but I'll be generous and go for a 7 :)"
"drpepper141","7","1","1","12 December 2012"," It's a good movie, worthy of being watched.
","Alice in Wonderland Review<br/><br/>Tim Burton's 2010 film ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a strange spin on the classic tale. The film is about Alice's return to Wonderland as an adult, after her time their as a child. It's different and it works well. Wonderland is a luscious and beautiful world, populated by unique and interesting creatures. For a two year old movie, ""Alice in Wonderland"" has amazing CGI effects, and all of Wonderland looks extraordinary.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is the only actor who truly shines in this movie, and shine he does. He portrays the Mad Hatter, a mad man with a top hat, orange hair and pasty skin. The Mad Hatter sometimes goes off on rants, which really help to showcase his madness. He is lighthearted and serious at the same time, and Johnny plays this character with such charisma he deserves an award. An actress worthy of mention is Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the Red Queen. Unfortunately, those are the only two actors worthy of notice. Mia Wasikowska, who plays Alice the protagonist, falls short as Alice. She delivers her lines so blandly and without passion that it is hard to feel sympathy for her, even when she's in the most desperate of circumstances. The rest of the characters are played well, but since their roles are so minor it is hard to want to mention them.<br/><br/>Alice's quest leads her to discover more about herself; that she wants to do something important in her life. ""Alice in Wonderland"" tells a good story, and it is a good movie. That's why I am giving this film an eight out of ten."
"love_for_nails","8","1","1","11 September 2012"," OK so...
","I watched the movie almost fifteen minutes ago and I could say that I surprisingly enjoyed it. I didn't understood all of those awe thoughts about the story of Alice, I personally didn't liked the story, thought it was too unreal, kind of childish, but the movie was more appealing and gave a different point of view to the hole story. The effects were good, the actors (the real ones) acted very good as well (the animated one too). Seeing Johnny as the Mad Hatter first time shock me a bit, even if I expected to look strange. I didn't know what to think about him, even his voice sounded different, but after a few moments since his introduction I recognized him and even going so far to really like him. He acted great, and he became my second favorite character from the movie after the Cheshire cat. The cat is my first favorite character, just for her teasing and shifty personality, Stephen Fry was great. As for the queens, I like both Anne Hathway's White Quenn as well as Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen, but I must admit I liked the Red queen more. It's just that magic that Helena pours in every villain she portrays that you can't possibly despise her. Last but not least Mia did a wonderful job playing Alice, at first I must admit I didn't like her, but after a few scenes I started to enjoy her presence. I felt sad that she didn't stay with the Hatter at the end but, it was necessary for her to leave, as she belonged to the real world, but I kind of hoped she would have had met the Hatter in some person she knew in her real life. (like she did with the two brother's for example) The special effects were good but not among the best in my opinion, so I don't know what to say about the won Oscar, but surely they worked hard so I guess the producers deserved some ""thanks"". But I agree with the costume design prize. I really liked Alice's dresses throughout the movie and other costumes as well. All in all was a good movie.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"filmfreak-ochoa23","8","1","1","7 August 2011"," Another take, more Narnian than Alice
","Alice in Wonderland- 2010 Tim Burton's live-action take and pseudo-sequel to the classic 1951 Disney adaptation of the same name, it succeeds in bringing the animated characters to life in a live-action format full of imaginative imagery which is the film's undeniable greatest feat. The film has a slightly different flashback sequence, which would be the 1951 film since it has the same structure according to Alice's description of her dream, by making Alice closer to her Father rather than her sister, now named Margaret rather than Lorine and making the effects of Wonderland more important than in the original source or other adaptations. In this version, both Alice and her father are deemed insane for thinking about trading with other countries and Alice's journey into Wonderland, a land full of impossibilities, helps her stand up for what she believes and what her father believed and take a chance when everybody thinks they are insane, and make a good moral. Instead of being Alice's imagination, Wonderland is a real place more in the likes of Narnia where they are oppressed and find a savior in Alice who is pre-ordained to save them from the Queen and her Jabberwock. I like this fact since it resembles the chess environment that the second novel had more than any other adaptation with the liberty of making this land real. Characters such as the White Rabbit and the Dorm Mouse are now fleshed out and even given names, Mally the Mouse and McTwisp the Rabbit. But at a larger sacrifice, my favorite character, the March Hare, and subsequently the Cheshire Cat are now reduced to mere cameos, which is a shame because I love their character designs with making the Hare twitchy and the Cat freakier with his smile, not exactly a Glasgow smile, but it kind of resembles it. The Mad Hatter is the biggest flaw in the movie. I can accept the more realistic, kind of Narnian tone that Burton was making but the look of the Hatter is not mad enough, he looks like a depressed clown, especially during the White raid flashback scene when he was working for the White Queen as her hatter. He's not mad and random as the Hare is, which they are supposed to be equally mad or make the Hatter madder. The repeated riddle ""Why is a raven like a writing desk"" gets very old trying to make it serious, which the whole point of the riddle was to point out the non-sensical which the 1951 version pulled superbly and I still think the Futterwacken was not mad but just plain retarded. Very good imagery and it's nice to see a live action version of the animated classic come to life, with a different tone since Wonderland is not a dream but a Narnian real place with consequences and larger lessons in the end for Alice, but the Hatter is more like Sweeney Todd minus the singing with Jack Sparrow combined which hurts the film, giving it a 7 out 10."
"the amorphousmachine","6","1","1","13 July 2011"," Was okay!
","One could say 'Alice in Wonderland' is certainly a digital wonderland, which doesn't quite mesh together well and feels cartoon-ish at the best of times. Visionary, stylistic filmmaker in Tim Burton returns with yet another recreation of a classic in Alice in Wonderland. However, much like 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', this film serves a purpose to inspire me to watch the original movies- in this case the 50s Disney cartoon that I so fondly remember. Or I could actually read the book! However, this film is not without its charm!<br/><br/>Yet another Tim Burton collaboration with Johnny Depp in a starring role! Filling the shoes (or hat) of the Mad Hatter. Johnny Depp does a reasonable job in this role, and is likable and insane enough. However, I think audiences are more curious to see Depp perform this character specifically than any other aspect of the movie. Helena Bonham Carter is quite good as the Red Queen, and this character is an interesting mix of actual real footage mixed in with digital effects- making Bonham Carter's head cleverly over-sized! Overall, the film is glossy and utilises some clever CGI mixed in with actual footage, but it all felt a little overdone! <br/><br/>Moving on to Alice. I actually thought Mia Wasikowska was quite good in the title role. I was more surprised to learn that she was one of the kids in 'The Kids Are Alright', which certainly displays some range! I didn't even know she was Australian, and I predict a great future for this young actress, as I think she held her own with Johnny Depp and a range of CGI animals and a giant jabberwocky to boot.<br/><br/>Basically, 'Alice in Wonderland' was a viewing afterthought for me, and I never rushed out to see it at the cinemas. I pretty much got what I expected, and that is a passable flick no better than something like 'Clash of the Titans' where you are curious to witness a digital CGI interpretation of classic characters and material. Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter all raised the bar with 'Sweeney Todd', but then again that was unfamiliar territory for me. Still, I felt 'Alice in Wonderland' was a step down for all three artists, but not a letdown! <br/><br/>*** out of *****!"
"Leeway-C-95","7","1","1","3 July 2011"," What has Tim Burton been Smoking?
","All the beauty and the hard work in creating Wonderland really pays off especially if seen in 3D. Tim Burton's dark direction of Alice In Wonderland is somewhat interesting, the finishing look looks well made but sometimes its a bit too gloomy and added with the dullness of a story that is all too mature for anybody 10 and under (Go figure: Alice is like in her late teens, more problems). The characters all have their own unique touch; Alice is the low key but she's not a chore to look at, Johnny Depp is as charming as ever (a more crazier take then Jack Sparrow), The Red Queen's big heart shaped head is BIG and Anne Hathaway's White Queen never stops putting her hands in the air. Each character has charm in them but when added with Tim Burton's touch, each of them have their own ""dark side."" Alice seems to be the normal one but the rest like Mad Hatter (his creepy red eyes) and White Queen (when she's not looking at her orchids she's in the kitchen making up a hot potion of fingers and saliva) are all mad but in a good-funny way. Let us not forget about Alan Rickman who plays an ugly-wrinkled caterpillar that only puffs on a cigarette or in a kid's interpretation 'sucking on a perfume looking bottle and blowing out circle clouds.' The whole entire film...lets just say, ""Tim Burton, WHAT on Earth have you've been smoking?"" The whole entire film is like on the high ride with Tim Burton which makes the film Mad! I guess its a good thing, whatever he's smoking seems to be working for him and while I was watching this film, I couldn't help but hallucinate as well. The Storyline of the Film: It gets a 60%. It was very simply done and told. It seems like every Disney movie has a theme which this one has. Theme: being brave and mad at the same time which is what I got out of it. I know other people think it's about governing yourself and taking the lead. The C.G.I usage of the Film: It gets an 80% Visually Striking! A movie that gets credits for the visuals. Overall: 70% It's an interesting film made only to catch the audience's eyes but it does little effect to move the heart."

","I remember growing up with the cartoon Alice in wonderland it was a wonderful film and one of Disney's classics films and now we have this remake to it made by Tim Burton who made the night mare before Christmas and Coraline which where amazing films This by the way is pretty good but it does have a few problems one of the main problems is that Alice does not want to kill an evil creature and I found this movie a little bit too dark it was also a bit too long. Okay the story is about Alice who is going to get married to some guy I don't remember what his name was but he looks like the guy from the new series of Doctor who and she finds the rabbit with the clock and chases him to the tree where she feels in as a kid and meets the hatter and some new characters which did not appear in the cartoon before. But all Theo this movie is pretty good but I think the writing could of been a little bit more stronger with the plot from the begging to the end its still a good movie but needs to be a bit more stronger if you know what I mean <br/><br/>But still a good movie with a few problems and needs stronger story line I give this movie a 7.2 out of 10 pretty good."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","1","24 March 2011"," Typical of Burton, the wonder is in the visuals.
","The world inside Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland is populated by angular characters who only exist to display their oddities. You never feel that they exist before Alice gets there. The challenge for Tim Burton is to open up that great book and extend its very limited characters into a story that we care about. That challenge comes from the nature of Carroll's writing. The most charming thing about ""Alice in Wonderland"" were the songs, the poems and the dances of lyrical nonsense. Those things are difficult to bring off the page, so what we are left with, in almost every version of this story, is a circus of odd creatures who are little more than irritations for Alice.<br/><br/>In the new film version, director Tim Burton has done himself a favor by progressing the story a decade and allowing characters that we are already familiar with to tell a new story. Tim Burton's version of Alice in Wonderland is, in effect, a sequel. It picks up 13 years later, when Alice Kingsley (Mia Wasikowska) is now 19 and flowering into young womanhood. She lives within the 19th century Victorian society but not of it. That is why she is about to be engaged to a hook-nosed stiff named Hamish (Leo Bill) who wouldn't know a knock-knock joke if it fell on him.<br/><br/>Alice has been convinced since childhood that her adventures in Wonderland were all a bizarre dream. Yet, it has left her with an abstract mind. She has no use for the stiff-upper class social demands that surround her. We can see in her eyes that the so-called dreams still consume her.<br/><br/>At her engagement party, she follows a familiar white rabbit a long, long, long way down a very long hole until she lands smack-dab in the middle of Wonderland. Yet, Wonderland isn't all that we imagined it to be. It is drab, dreary with rundown buildings and an overcast sky. That has to do with a change in the seat of power. The Red Queen of Hearts (Helena Bonham-Carter, sporting an over-sized head) has taken over and all life and color have been sucked out of the land.<br/><br/>The familiar occupants of Wonderland are there. There's the feisty door mouse (voice of Barbara Windsor); The avuncular Caterpillar (voice of Alan Rickman); The March Hare (voice of Paul Whitehouse); The perfectly pleasant Tweedle Twins (Matt Lucas). The movie does not waste a lot of time introducing these characters because, based on the nature of the script, it assumes that we already know who they are. They enlist Alice's help to slay the evil Jabberwocky (voice of Christopher Lee) and knock the queen off her throne. The problem is, Alice doesn't remember having ever been in Wonderland the first time. She is still convinced that this is all nightmare, and expects to simply wake up at any moment.<br/><br/>Burton, working from a screenplay by Linda Wooverton (who also contributed to Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King), tightens down the plot which, I think, keeps the characters from really coming to life. They all have their eccentricities but they form a collective, and no one ever really has a moment to shine. The charm of the book was that the plot was loose enough to allow these characters room to play.<br/><br/>The exception is Johnny Depp, who occupies the role of The Mad Hatter from head to toe. Most actors would have played this as a costume role but Depp - as he always does - dives headfirst into this material, and takes it as seriously as the character will allow. With his deathly white skin, his frightful frizz on red hair and his unhealthy green eyes, he resembles a character who looks sick beyond repair - kind of a radioactive Ronald McDonald. Yet, Depp's rendition of The Hatter is slightly more sympathetic then I remember from the book and it is a nice turn.<br/><br/>I was also impressed by Mia Wasikowska, as Alice. She takes the role seriously, but wears just enough amusement on her face to be in Wonderland but not of it. She thinks it is all a dream and accepts it at face value. She is an expressive actress who plays Alice with a note of irritation. She convinces herself that this Wonderland business is all a dream and seems frustrated that it is taking so long to wake up. Trapped in a power struggle between The Red Queen, and her sister, the fluttery White Queen (Ann Hathaway) there are enough sights and sounds to keep her in therapy for years but she takes it all in stride.<br/><br/>That power struggle, by the way, gives us the film's weak point. While the early scenes examine Wonderland in all its eccentric fun, the third is a let-down. It turns into a standard battle between good and evil that only achieves the goal of wrapping up the story. Burton doesn't even take advantage of the fact that the battle between the armies of Red and White are taking place on a chess board - it looks like a grey-coaled version of Braveheart. Ho hum.<br/><br/>My problem with Burton's films always lie at the screenplay level. He is a visual master and here he creates Wonderland under siege. The outlying regions look drab and grey while the Red Queen's castle is a masterwork of reds and whites and lush greens. By comparison, it is far more appealing than the castle of the white queen which is washed out in white as if the place is waiting for the painters to arrive. Yet his screenplay suffers by tying up its plot in a standard action story. Surely there must be far more craziness to run these characters through than a battle to the death with a deck of cards.<br/><br/><ul><li>Jerry Roberts</li></ul>"
"lasttimeisaw","6","1","1","9 December 2010"," Alice In Wonderland: 6/10
","Tim Burton is a dignitary among contemporary directors, but I have never been his devoted fan, my favorite Burton's film is Edward Scissorhands (1990) (Sleepy Hollow comes next). Also I have a little grudge over his last film Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), as I find it meaningless besides its theatrical performances and gloomy settings or maybe I am just simply fed up with Gothicism.<br/><br/>Frankly speaking, this film is only a mediocre work from Burton, the imaginary wonderland is Burtonesque but the story is witless, which evolves in a quite prosaic way without highlights or excitements. However the fun is still achievable especially I think the newcomer Mia Wasikowska's novelty is pervasive all over the film, which is adorable and eliminates lots of sleepiness. Helena Bonham Carter as the evil Red Queen and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen are both skin-deep characters but fully bring forth the vividness. Johnny Depp is as crazy as usual as the mad hatter, but not particularly remarkable. Surprisingly I am very much impressed by the voice of Alan Rickman as Absolem, the mighty caterpillar, which is truly mesmerizing.<br/><br/>This 3D feature won a huge success in the worldwide box office (collected more than 1 billion US dollars) as it followed the 3D upsurge just after Avatar earlier this year, however I become somewhat worried about Burton's next project as it seems that his fame is forestalling his talent to reach his maximal level, owing to a fact that Burton has never been nominated as Best Director in Oscars, which might hint us that in some level Tim Burton and Michael Bay belong to the same category, more like a skillful film craftsman than a genuine auteur."
"TxMike","Null","1","1","30 June 2010"," Very interesting take on the Alice in Wonderland story.
","I've been around a long time, I have read lots of fiction, and I have seen lots of movies. But I must count myself among those who was only vaguely familiar with the story here, ""Alice in Wonderland."" I knew it had to do with falling into a hole, and encountering some unusual creatures, but not much else.<br/><br/>This movie starts with Alice as a young girl, and discussing imagination with her father who always told her you can't do the impossible until you believe that it is possible.<br/><br/>The main of this movie however is of Alice in her late teen years, and as she is proposed to by a geeky red-haired guy, she runs off to think. And that is when she accidentally falls down a hole at the base of a large tree. This is evidently her second time down the hole, the first when she was much younger. Seems everyone in that strange land is waiting for her. Because she must help defeat the large-headed red queen, in favor of the nicer white queen.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has top billing as the Mad (as in 'crazy') Hatter. Young Australian actress Mia Wasikowska is teenage Alice. Helena Bonham Carter is the Red Queen. Anne Hathaway is the White Queen. And Alan Rickman voices the animated Blue Caterpillar.<br/><br/>Visually the film is excellent. It is not all fun and happiness, in fact it is a fairly 'dark' film. But I am glad I finally saw ""Alice in Wonderland."""
"aimless-46","Null","1","1","31 March 2010"," Curtsey While You're Thinking What to Say - It Saves Time
","As an ""Alice"" purist I generally cringe at the assortment of attempts to adapt either of Lewis Carroll's works ""Alice in Wonderland"" and/or ""Through the Looking Glass"" to the movie screen. These have been of varying quality but even the best are no more than satisfactory (""Dreamchild"" being an exception but it was more about the real Alice than about the Wonderland Alice).<br/><br/>But I had a pretty good idea what I was getting into before shelling out the bucks to see this Burton effort in 3-D. I knew that despite what many have said and despite its title, this is not an adaptation of Carroll's books. Accordingly I knew that this would greatly increase my toleration level. They could do what they liked with the traditional characters and play around with whatever sort of plot elements intrigued them; I would not take particular offense.<br/><br/>That said I had no real problem with anything about the film. In Burton and writer Linda Woolverton's story, Alice revisits Wonderland/The Looking Glass House 13 years after waking up from her original dreams. Alice, now almost 20, is attending her sister's garden party, which she discovers is intended to be her engagement party. Cringing at a marriage proposal from the unappealing son of her father's former business partner, she runs from the party and follows a white rabbit down an immense hole.<br/><br/>Her seemingly endless fall is arguably the best scene of the film and is by far the best Hollywood has ever assembled; even including a slick twist at the bottom where her hair is standing on end. Then she repeats the drink-me eat-me shrinking-growing bit from the book. And these two sequences are pretty much the only thing other than the characters that come directly out of the book. One advantage of having a 20-year-old Alice is that her clothes do not shrink or grow with her size changes. She must improvise on each occasion and this adds a touch of physical comedy to the transformations.<br/><br/>For her part Alice seems to have suppressed the memory of her two childhood dreams, showing little familiarity with the characters she is meeting for a second time (in some cases a third time). And initially they are unsure that she is the same Alice who visited them over a decade earlier. But for the white rabbit, the dormouse, the Tweedles, and the smoking caterpillar she has be the right Alice because they have lured her back to fulfill a prophecy. It has been foretold that Alice will slay the Jabberwocky (a dragon worthy of the lizards in the old 50's sci-fi films) with a magical sword. This will change the balance of power, with the good White Queen getting the crown from the wicked Red Queen. We've seen this thing before, insert: ""Narnia, Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings"" here. And they throw in a few visuals from ""The Neverending Story"" series.<br/><br/>Ultimately Alice goes all ""Joan of Arc"" or at least ""Jane and the Dragon"" and becomes a knight in armor. Many have lamented this action adventure turn of the story but the actual showdown takes only about 10 minutes so I don't think it is that big of a deal. And it has some considerable basis as Alice had been the White Queen's Pawn (because the Queen's daughter Lily was too young to play) throughout the chess match in ""Through the Looking Glass"". That story was just one big chess game with a lengthy combat segment between the White Knight and the Red Knight, as well as a fight between the ""Gladstone"" Lion and the ""Disraeli"" Unicorn for the crown. The only problem I see is that the combat is all too predictable.<br/><br/>Burton's film has many delightful moments; I liked it better than almost any of the recently released big budget stuff although it's not in the same league as ""Pride and Prejudice"" or ""Atonement"".<br/><br/>Mia Waisikowska strikes a perfect balance as the title character, playing the bravest heroine in literary history requires a lot of nonverbal stuff and she sells her reluctance nicely along with giving her character a subtle sensual dimension.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter pretty much steals the film, although she is upstaged on occasion by the grinning Cheshire cat. Depp's Mad Hatter never quite comes into focus, playing the character as a schizophrenic (at least that's what I assume he was doing) introduced a little too much pain into this type of story; in much the same way that his take on Willy Wonka just brought the viewer down. A run-of-the-mill lunatic would worked better.<br/><br/>As the White Queen, Anne Hathaway was pretty much irrelevant and was most likely cast because of her ""small"" head (her features seem to take up her entire face-especially with the extreme make-up), a kind of good-guy bad-guy balance for her evil sister's big head. But I did like the off-kilter Morticia Addams take she gave her character; rather than playing her as a goody-two-shoes.<br/><br/>The audience during my showing was attentive and entertained from beginning to end (well almost to the end as the film goes out on a couple of extremely weak scenes back on the surface). But most bolted before the closing credits, which played over Avril Lavigne singing ""Alice"" (Avril also appears in the film's trailer). Given that it is mostly up-scale theaters with state-of-the-art sound systems showing this film, those who left missed one of the best moments of the whole viewing experience. Not unlike those who missed the great closing credits animation sequences at the end of ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"".<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
"minirorita","Null","1","1","31 March 2010"," a long-lasting fairy tale:Alice in wonderland
","Alice in wonderland is a story that has existed since our childhood. When I was a child, I have to imagine the scene and the characters by myself, because there are only a few pictures in the book, never can I foresee that someday, there will be a movie about it, needless to say in a 3D version. No sooner was the movie published did I went to see it, one reason is that I would like to know how they transfer a simple story into a one hour movie, another reason is that I like Ann Hathaway a lot, I think she is a great actress, not only is she pretty but also skilled in acting. When finishing the film, I think there are some differences in the story, the scenes are sometimes not so optimistic, even scary to me! Maybe it's because those movement and monsters are shown too vividly. Since I like Ann Hathaway a lot, I expected her to appear very often in the movie; however, it did not. All in all, it is still a pretty nice movie to entertain yourself, also to see the changes between the first time you read it in your childhood, and also this time, when we're a grown up already. To me I found myself enjoying the movie a lot, but also kind of disappointed, because it is not so a fulfilled movie as I imagine, which means, the theme itself is not so meaningful, anyway, I consider it a movie just to call back my memories, so just forget the knowledge part, and let my memories revise."

","I love Tim Burton movies, that has to be said at the beginning, I am not hater of his, but an admirer, even more so (if that is possible) since I have been to that exhibition of him in the Moma/ New York. Anyway I am somewhat familiar with the original Alice, but I knew the movie would be different and I accepted it as totally OK. The cast sounded fabulous, Helena Bonham- Carter (Red Queen) and Johnny Depp (Mad Hatter) were in it, which was to be expected, also Anne Hathaway (White Queen) and Mia Wasikowska as Alice. I watched it in 3D and here is what happened: The movie starts. I am excited. The movies goes on. I am still excited. (this could be repeated a hundred times). The movie ends. I am sitting in my chair, turning to my mother with a somewhat puzzled expression on my face, which can be seen on hers too. And we thought ""And that was it now?"" We were left somehow unsatisfied. I cannot put my foot down and describe it exactly, but there was something missing. The grip, the fascination, the thrill. All these words do not really express what was missing, but maybe you felt it too, or you will feel it too. It wasn't because of the performances. Helena was as evil as red queen, but she was also amusing and somewhat funny. Anne was amusing, I liked her as the White Queen. Especially I liked Matt Lucas as Tweedledee/Tweedledum and Mia Wasikowska was great as Alice. Also Stephen Frys voice was so great for the Cat and I loved the appearance of it so much. Still... I went out of the cinema thinking, that I was disappointed. The movie did not manage to fulfill my expectations as a whole."

","This is basically a sequel to the original ""Alice in Wonderland"" and not a good one at that. Tim Burton has a good vivid imagination when it comes to his films, such as this one. It's a shame though that his level of creative doesn't match his level of storytelling because the plot just wasn't that good. Johnny Depp is a actor that really gets into his roles, but there just wasn't anything memorable about this one, he just looked like a clown with the mix of personalities between Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow. For a place called Wonderland, people would expect a lot of mad characters to be in it, but everyone seemed pretty normal. As a matter of fact everything seemed find and dandy until Alice decides to comeback to Wonderland, than all hell breaks lose for some reason. It's a shame Tim Burton's great imagination can't match his level of of storytelling.<br/><br/>6.8/10"

I'll admit, it was pretty decent, but that was with the 3D, and special effects. I'm pretty sure it's one of those films that might drag on if I saw it with out them. Well of course what I like about this film was the special effects, the costumes, and the story wasn't too bad either. I think it will be good enough to see in the theatres just once, or rent it for when it comes out on Blu-ray and DVD. Another thing I liked was the morale of the story. It's pretty much true, in general of life.<br/><br/>I'm not giving this a rating because I am not sure what to rate it."

"ShelbyTMItchell","6","1","1","19 March 2010"," Cute But Not Really Extravogant!
","The film was cute but not all that was made out to be in the previews. As Tim Burton wanted to make it a darker tone, compared to all of the others before his version. In particular the, Disney Cartoon version.<br/><br/>Alice as a little girl had nightmares about going to a place such as Wonderland. Her doting dad tried to assure her that they were only nightmares. Years later, as a 19-year old, and her dad has died.<br/><br/>She feels like she isn't accepted as royalty and forced into the royalty scene. And forced to be wedded to a nerdy-like guy that has nothing in common with her. But strange things do happen.<br/><br/>When she falls into a hole after chasing a bunny. The ""nightmare/dream"" becomes a reality. And she for once, becomes a woman and more independent from those dreams/nightmares.<br/><br/>Her adventure begins but she is torn between the good, White Queen and the bad, Queen of Hearts. Both of them sisters as the former wants to end the feud. But it is up to Alice to end it, in a way that forces her not just to become independent. But also to make her own choices in the long run.<br/><br/>There she makes friends with the Mad Hatter, given a much larger role than an other incarnations stated due to Johnny Depp, working with Tim Burton for the seventh time. Among others and other characters that come up to life.<br/><br/>The script kind of didn't make any sense due to the darker tone. The special effects were good. But don't go to the restroom or get popcorn/drinks, etc. You have to watch the movie the whole way through. In order to get the story. From beginning to end. As it makes perfect sense. To make sure that the story matches up with the special effects and all of that.<br/><br/>Mia Wasikowski is good in the role of Alice. Anne Hathaway overdid it though as the White Queen. Johnny Depp kind of took a backseat to Mia's Alice but was good with what he was thrown at by Burton. The Mad Hatter had a lot of more depth and height with the role. Than an any other incarnations before this one. Helena Boneham Carter kind of save the movie as the perfect, nasty Queen of Hearts.<br/><br/>It is a cute film but not the best. Still, they tried as hard as possible."
"moviewizguy","7","1","1","16 March 2010"," You've got a very important date
","Alice returns to the whimsical world she first encountered as a young girl, reuniting with her childhood friends: the White Rabbit, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Dormouse, the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, and of course, the Mad Hatter. Alice embarks on a fantastical journey to find her true destiny and end the Red Queen's reign of terror.<br/><br/>I haven't read the original book or have seen one single adaptation so I didn't know what to expect when walking into this film other than the fact that it has the trio who always stick together: Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter. By the end of the film, I was blown away by the imagery of the story, although not the story itself. I went to see this film in 3D, and I'm glad to say it was perfectly suitable for the film.<br/><br/>The use of this technology was similar to AVATAR in that it used the 3D to enhance the storytelling experience rather than throw things at the audience every five minutes. Another thing I enjoyed is the visual treat. Once Alice goes to Wonderland, we get to see a lot of jaw-dropping images that do not let up. It's, literally, one great imagery after another after another after another. You can tell the people working on this film worked their butts off for this and it really paid off. The story, however, didn't match to the high standards of the visuals. It was interesting in some ways but the film does meander a lot in the middle of the film. Still, by the end, I enjoyed it overall.<br/><br/>Another thing I enjoyed a lot is the characters, particularly Alice, the Red Queen and the Cheshire Cat. Most of the characters are really sweet. The performance by newcomer Mia Wasikowska is really good. There is this aura around her that lightens up the screen every time she's on. Johnny Depp is weird at first, but it's mostly kinda boring. I didn't find him interesting as much as the other colorful characters in here. However, I did love Helena Bonham Carter and her ""Off with their heads!"" line that seem to plague 90% of her dialogue. I also loved Anne Hathaway as well. Some may find her performance overreaching but I think it's appropriate to the weirdness of the film. And it's always great to see Crispin Glover in a weird role.<br/><br/>The voice work is as good as the live actors, if not better. Michael Sheen as the White Rabbit works really well along with the noticeable Alan Rickman voicing the Blue Caterpillar. Barbara Windsor gives us a cute and cuddly character as the Dormouse. Oh, and the more we say less about Paul Whitehouse as the March Hare, the better. I found his character to be disturbing to say the least.<br/><br/>The movie could have fallen to the ""all style but no substance"" category if it weren't for the great characters and the unique approach given by Tim Burton and his wonderful, yet odd, visual style. The film is humorous at times that I chuckled quite a bit throughout the film and heartfelt at times. Sure, some people would criticize the film for being uninteresting and underwhelming as compared to the visual style but I think it's good enough in my book. Watch the film in 3D or in IMAX 3D if you have the chance because it's really worth the money to bring yourself in a magical world filled with wonder."

"Willscrlt","10","9","26","5 March 2010"," Brilliantly fun, somewhat mad, generally uplifting adventure with Burton's signature touches
","This was a fun and exciting movie, and it was excellent in IMAX 3D. If you are expecting the original Disney animated feature, there are a few very well done nods to it, but overall, this is a grown-up adventure fitting a grown-up Alice. There is lots of eye candy (and I mean that in a good way) for both adults and children, but many of the scenes are too intense, disturbing, or scary for younger viewers—especially without adult supervision.<br/><br/>Aside from several ""gloomy"" sets, and two disturbing ones (involving beheadings and decapitated heads), Tim Burton seems to have finally left behind his juvenile fascination with the grotesque, heavy Gothic influences, and dark humor. Perhaps it was a positive influence from Disney, but the movie had an overall uplifting feel to it, despite many side trips through dark places. I hope that Burton will continue to ""lighten up"" in his future works, while maintaining his wonderful sense of style, surprise, and hyper-reality.<br/><br/>Mia Wasikowska was a brilliant casting choice. Her character development from a dazed and confused innocent (almost annoyingly so) to her final state of mind was very well performed. She is a beautiful actress, and does a fantastic job—very believable.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was terrific—as always. His accents and mannerisms were zany, but avoided the creepiness of his Willy Wonka performance. Bear in mind that mercury poisoning was an occupational hazard of hatters in that period, and that tended to drive many of them quite insane. Depp's Hatter shifts between reality and altered reality masterfully, and the character is quite cunning and intelligent despite his madness.<br/><br/>I finally liked Helena Bonham Carter in a role. Often, I feel her performances go over the top (in a bad way), but here she portrayed a different form of madness from the Hatter—a madness any powerful and wealthy person could find themselves in. Surrounded by sycophants and toadies, the Red Queen came across nearly as much of a victim as she did the primary villain. I almost felt sorry for her at the end. Almost.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway did a wonderful job (as always) in a role that was pretty, yet mildly disturbing. It reminded me a bit of the ugly side of high fashion crossed with the beauty of a dark winter's night. The contrast between light and dark, etherealness, and beauty and blandness were very well captured in both the scenery and costuming, but especially in Hathaway's performance. Her performance was very different from the other characters I've seen her portray, especially Mia in the Princess Diaries.<br/><br/>Crispin Glover was creepy and came off a bit as a fetishist. In other words, his performance was typical of others I've seen him give. In a way, he was a straight man to Carter's outlandishness, or the canvas that gives the painting its form. For that, he did a good job, despite being creepy.<br/><br/>I did not even know that Alan Rickman was cast in the movie, but as soon as the Caterpillar started speaking, I recognized the actor's very distinctive voice. I think Rickman did well in the role, but I kept picturing Professor Snape from Harry Potter talking and sneering. The Caterpillar's final speaking scene in the movie was the best. Rickman stretched his voice in different ways, and I finally heard the Caterpillar as himself.<br/><br/>The Cheshire Cat, voiced by Stephen Fry, was probably my favorite non- human character, but all of the animals and creatures were quite well done. The White Rabbit, voiced by Michael Sheen, was terrific as well.<br/><br/>This was my first time seeing a movie in IMAX 3-D. Frankly, 3-D movies in the past never have impressed me much, and usually gave me headaches. However, I think this movie actually was improved by the 3-D environment. Instead of being strung-together in-my-face effects for the sake of effects, this movie used the environment (including the huge IMAX screen) to fully engulf and involve me in the movie. Things all around the screen moved in very realistic ways. The story really came to life. No headache, either.<br/><br/>In summary, if you are looking for an entertaining movie that the tweens, teens, and adults will enjoy, this is probably it. If you are looking for blood and gore, this really isn't it. If you are enamored with Tim Burton's old, darker stuff, then you might be disappointed, but if you like his newer works, like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you will probably like this one even more. If you enjoyed the classic animated film as a kid, you will probably appreciate this movie now as an adult."

Surely this would be the ultimate Burtonesque experience.<br/><br/>I first caught wind of it well over a year ago, waited anxiously, scheduled the day off of work 6 months in advance, bought my tickets a week ahead of time and drove an hour to the largest IMAX screen in the area to see it in 3D.<br/><br/>I walked out feeling robbed, confused, overall discontent.<br/><br/>I've been contemplating my true feelings towards this film for nearly a week now and I'm finally in a comfortable place about it: Tim Burton was just not meant to direct Alice in Wonderland. It should have been so obvious.<br/><br/>Created by Disney (CalArts), rejected by Disney (Giant Zlig, his work on The Black Cauldron) and then suddenly reclaimed by Disney when his ""twisted"" style became trendy and parental approved, and ultra lucrative (Nightmare) we have finally witnessed the disaster that occurs when Burton actually PAIRS with Disney to make a film.<br/><br/>Remove the element of Wonderland entirely and what you have is Tim Burton and Linda Woolverton. A visionary artist paired with the writer of ""Rescue Rangers"" and ""My Little Pony"" scripts. It seems as though Disney signed Burton for the project and then blindly plucked one of their talentless fluff writers from their pool of many, just so they could accredit a ""writer"" during the opening titles.<br/><br/>So now that we have this disastrous equation, let's throw the base concept back into it: The original Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking glass are, by nature, pulp tales without concrete plot or intention. The only thing they offer is satire and political and social commentary. There exists no plot that could save it from Linda Woolverton. This film was thrown to the Woolves. (heh) Tim Burton is a storyteller. (Remember ""The Storyteller"" series for God's sake!) Burton's signature visual style is obvious, but as a director, he shines in films that have strong syntax and evoke raw human emotions... as his artistic point of view often juxtaposes and reinforces the overall emotional experience of those films.<br/><br/>So we get this Disney broad trying to force a completely dead plot upon a concept that was never meant to have a plot and it's up to Tim Burton to save the whole damn thing with some strategically placed shadows and polka dots and twisted trees and personified knick-knacks.<br/><br/>Throw Depp's thoughtless recycled characters into the mix (Was it Jack Sparrow? Wonka? I'm so confused), it's like salt in a wound.<br/><br/>Disney's pockets are full, Burton's pockets are full, mine are empty. And I'm not so concerned about the $30, but the fact that I spent that $30 to witness Tim Burton lend his artistry to another vapid Disney cash-vortex? Very upsetting."

","Dark side director Tim Burton with screen alter ego Johnny Depp in tow would seem a safe logical and predictable choice to direct the surreal Alice in Wonderland in 3D and for his fans I'm sure he doesn't disappoint. But even though tweaked for today's audience with an age of consent anorexic Alice faced with a pre rabbit hole crisis there is a clear lack of creativity that makes this Alice a tedious waste of time. <br/><br/>Burton with all the technical bells and whistles at his disposal employs his usual characteristic quirks while Depp dresses up in his latest Halloween costume making for a joyless and disturbing Alice bereft of charm and lightness of intent. As a shabby underworld Wonka Depp's Mad Hatter is a waste of time as is Anne Hathaway's White Queen. They are two big names who contribute nothing besides luring one to the theatre. The technical advances bring improvement to the rabbits the caterpillar and Ts Dumb and Dee but the Cheshire Cat is a disappointment literally lacking the 51 Disney's hallucinogenic color. Only Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen seems to capture the spirit of the original character.<br/><br/>Since the turn of the last century there have been at least two dozen renderings on film of the classic children's story Alice in Wonderland. Like all children's stories it has amazing resilience in that its large core audience re-generates on a yearly basis by having it imposed on them by parents who underwent the same process. By the time this audience gets around to Cervantes and Dosteyevsky the numbers drop precipitously. Karamozov is a gamble but Alice is a safe box office bet. Time dictates updated makeovers however and like Betty Crocker and Aunt Jemima Alice has gone through a variety of changes not specifically intended for children. There have been adult, modern day, animated, musical and even x-rated versions. This take is little more than a tarted up and edgy Alice that is too dark for children and too childish for adults. This may add up to big box office drawing off both demographics but as a film it's an uneven travesty."

","The first time I saw the trailer for this movie it was very foreboding to me... It was filled to the brim with CGI, and on the foreground was Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter who looks like a dragqueen (I'm sorry, but he really does). My expectations for this movie got very low from that moment on.<br/><br/>Now that I finally got to see it, I have to admit that its not all that bad. The story is consistent, Wonderland looks well-designed and they even added the Jabberwocky-poem in there which is awesome. However, I do feel that they overdid the CGI at some points. I know its a fantasy- film, but I think some nice imaginative puppetry would do the film so much more good.<br/><br/>Some characters seemed a little undeveloped to me, and the focus lies way too much on Johnny Depp's role in my opinion. I like Johnny Depp and I think he's a great actor, but I don't think he added anything really crucial to the film or anything and his acting almost seemed like a quick rehash of his Jack Sparrow role from The Pirates of the Caribean. The Cheshire cat was not mysterious at all, since it is very clear that he's a good guy from the beginning. The Cheshire cat's character would work so much better if he only gave Alice subtle clues and riddles. My final beef has got to be the design of the Jabberwock. The illustration by John Tenniel makes the Jabberwock look like a very creepy creature, so why did they turn him into a generic dragon?<br/><br/>Kids will not mind the complaints though, and I think they will have a blast with this movie as well as Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans. In the end, thats what I think this movie is more marketed towards, and not Wonderland-fans."
"semiotechlab-658-95444","1","4","9","12 March 2010"," A missed chance
","Charles L. Dodgson, Professor for Mathematics and Logic at the renowned Christ Church College in Oxford gave his two Alice-Books that he wrote under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll as Christmas gifts for Alice Pleasance Liddell, the little daughter of his boss and director of the College. Other books followed, letters, too, in which Carroll got more and more clear and serious about his sexual interest in the little girl. The family Liddle excluded him from the annual invitation, and forthwith he was isolated in his University, at least his job was not taken away - from fear of a scandal in Victorian England. In the preamble of ""Through the Looking-Glass"", he wrote: ""Child of the pure unclouded brow / And dreaming eyes of wonder! / Though time be fleet, and I and thou / Are half a life asunder (...). I have not seen thy sunny face, / Nor heard thy silver laughter: No thought of me shall find a place / In thy young life's hereafter / Come hearken then, ere voice of dread, / With bitter tidings laden, / Shall summon to unwelcome bed / A melancholy maiden! (...)"". The case is clear: Alice should always remember the love of her fatherly friend when some day - as Carroll is convinced - Alice will be ""laid"" (cf. laden) by male brutality in her future child-bed. Not only is it unthinkable for Carroll that an other man will come in Alice's life, for him, Carroll, love comprises only that subtle form of touching the hardly sprouted blooms. What a great idea would it have been if Alice was allowed to go back to her trip down to the Wonderland together with Carroll. Strictly speaking, according to the above quotations, she has no right and (most supposedly) no possibility to enter that reign of her youth anyway. Despite the concession of every artistic freedom, I see here in Burton's movie first a gigantic and unforgivable misunderstanding of Carroll's work, and second, sadly enough, a missed chance that would have open quite newer horizons for this movie than repetition according to the pattern of theme and variation."
"the_daz","4","4","9","12 March 2010"," Did Tim Burton actually direct this?
","The main thing I felt after seeing this film was... Tim Burton needs to take a vacation.<br/><br/>A long one.<br/><br/>This so-called movie had virtually none of Burton's quirkiness and unique view of the world. The guy is making too many movies, and he's clearly on auto pilot. Alice in Wonderland was the most vacuous cinematic experience I've had in a long time. And this is coming from a long-time Tim Burton fan.<br/><br/>Sure, the film was beautifully designed, but it's filled with so many visual effects and many of them distracting, that it was almost impossible to be engaged with anything that took place. It was obvious that the actors rarely shared the stage simultaneously, as almost everyone was digitally mutated in some way. In fact, the whole film was various effects layered on top of one another in EVERY shot, and some of them poorly realised.<br/><br/>The script had no evidence of craft anywhere to be seen. The ""story"" just plodded along from one event to another, without any sense of drama or emotion whatsoever. Mia Wasikowska as Alice was so apathetically dull and looked quite anaemic (Was that intentional, and if so, why?) that she too made it difficult to care about what was going on.<br/><br/>What an incredibly synthetic and robotic production, regardless of its extra ""dimension"".<br/><br/>Maybe they should've considered adding more than one dimension to the script."
"iizwank","5","4","9","8 March 2010"," An anti-climax and essentially a disappointment
","In the 1970's the door on New Hollywood was emphatically shut with blockbusters Jaws and Star Wars taking millions. Studios took it upon themselves to reign in the indulgent artistry of a director like Burton to focus on selling a product. This is what this film represents. It is the death of a once visionary director who suffers at the hand of marketability.<br/><br/>To focus on the film it is grounded by an 'against-all-odds' story seen in most generic child/teen films of today. The problem is anyone who has read the stories will know that this isn't the setup. This wouldn't have been a problem had the new story been original and anywhere near good. Burton did say he struggled to make it a story but who ever said a story meant good vs. evil, the frame of the story just didn't suit the characters he initially presents and then in an act of disloyalty to Carroll are made as forgettable and generic as the film itself. The entire thing is centered, not so unpredictably, around Burton's proxy, Depp, who serves to fill every desire Burton see's fit in the most crass and at times atrociously cringe-worthy manner. (there is a moment when you feel a Jar Jar Binks cameo might save it, it's that bad) It's really too obvious that he should have such a significant role for Depps character who is mentioned no more than any other in the original stories and in trying to create such a role has greatly hampered the film.<br/><br/>Knowing what you know about Alice in Wonderland and Tim Burton makes this film intensely disappointing in every conceivable way. His vision was lost, having said this you have to question if it was ever there with the narrative being as poor as it is. It is true, escapism for the audience is possible at times, largely due to the novelty of 3D but it isn't enough and the precedent set by the '51 film makes Burtons seem a little easy and feeble. The screenplay is cheesy fueling the fire in your head that this film is for one purpose only, money. Burton said he wanted something that was more than a series of events but went too far in creating a story I think no one really wanted or expected from Alice in Wonderland. It is true of course the success of the film at the box office is undeniable but in the modern era of film I feel we are crying out for some director with an alternative vision, with the resolution and much needed luck to evade studio criteria so that they may take us to somewhere we haven't been before. The novelty of 3D gave Burton the advantage but he still fell short of delivering a film that was memorable and encapsulating for its audience. It all felt set up to win over younger audiences and that seems to be what mattered."
"laser110","4","4","9","7 March 2010"," Not so Wonderful
","I saw this movies last night and was really excited to see it. As usual we sat through the obligatory 15-20 minutes of previews and finally the lights went low and the film started. I will try to give a full review and anything that resembles a spoiler is not intended.<br/><br/>The first 10-20 minutes left me confused exactly where it was going. Once I realized, I couldn't wait for Alice to find her way to the rabbit-hole and start her adventure, even that seemed to drag on, although it probably wasn't very long into the movie, it felt it was.<br/><br/>My excitement quickly turned to boredom. The Red Queen played by Bonham-Carter was entertaining for the first few minutes, but I found her constant shrieking to be more of an annoyance. Almost soon as Alice enters Underland (Wonderland to a younger Alice) you are introduced to every character, leaving nothing to surprise. None of the characters are ever fully explained in any sense that you understand their importance to the story. Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dee are mildly entertaining, but their bickering grows thin and quickly.<br/><br/>Chesire Cat, a Character that was so well done in the Animated classic is just weird when you first meet him, and not weird in a way that makes you like him. He has a very short role initially and again leaves you guessing who or what he is.<br/><br/>Then comes Depp as the Mad-Hatter. A huge disappointment to me. His first scene show him walking towards Alice across the top of the table and his actions, tone, hand movements etc look Jack Sparrow-ish. His outfit and makeup reminded me more of a circus clown that someone who would be ""mad"". Nothing mad about his character at all. Besides some nonsensical verbiage, and a absolutely stupid dance, I think the only thing mad about him is how we have been duped into thinking that this version of Depp would be any better than what we have already seen in prior films.<br/><br/>Hathaway's White Queen is sad looking. She flits around with her hands held high, in a another imitation of Sparrow and her white makeup, matched with really dark lips make her look as dead as her performance. I couldn't get over how weird her really black bushy eyebrows looked standing out against her pale white face. Again very clown-ish.<br/><br/>Alice, played by Mia Wasikowska is a star in this film, but she always seemed lost in who she is and exactly why she is there. She has no purpose and the film, which is built around her stumbles around looking for the same purpose as Alice does the same. She seems to be a bright actress with a possible future, but her role in this film could have been filled by any other 19-ish blond girl with wavy hair. The voice she finds towards the end, reminds me of the Alice in the animated version, and wish it was there throughout the film.<br/><br/>The 1951 Disney Animated version showcased a trippy version down the rabbit hole that held both surprises and kept us entertained. Characters were built and explored. I expected the same of this version, especially knowing that Tim Burton, a director known for his weird sense of reality, would display. I expected vibrant colors and got drab gray's. I expected a weird fascinating trip, and instead got a chance to stay home and watch the TV.<br/><br/>A Final note, the Score, by Danny Elfman. Usually I like Danny's stuff. he has done so many great scores and some very memorable music. I felt like the music here was a rehash of the score from Charley and the Chocolate Factory, another Burton Film."

","As an avid viewer in the cinematic world, I must trust that most directors indeed have good intentions. It is after viewing a set of film's that we may begin making assessments. I could not comment on whether or not this film's main influence was that of gaining a quick few extra bucks. However, I can say that being a huge fan of Tim Burton's films, I can't say I was disappointed. I felt the film was honest. And to judge this film based on Burton's other works or the actual story behind this set of characters is a bit useless. Burton always adds his tweaks, variations, and style to most of his works. I'm in favor of a director taking a story and expressing their interpretation of it. Therefore, I would recommend adding this film to the Burton fan's collection. Enjoy!"

","A flat, tired film that takes it source material, strips it of all its mystery, wit, weirdness, and dream logic, and recasts it as a formulaic, paint-by-numbers generic fantasy-adventure movie. Read the book and see if you can imagine any of those characters doing anything that happens in this movie. These formerly unpredictable characters are reduced to stereotypes with an occasional nod to whimsy thrown in.<br/><br/>I certainly understand Alice's conviction that Wonderland isn't a real place, given the flashy yet insubstantial CGI nature of the environment and almost everyone in it.<br/><br/>Surely the fate of Wonderland should not hinge on anything as uninspired as an armored Alice getting into a sword fight with a CGI dragon.<br/><br/>Forthcoming literary adaptations by Tim Burton:<br/><br/>Moby Dick: A quirky but two-fisted sea captain (Johnny Depp) pursues a monstrous white whale through a number of huge CGI set pieces.<br/><br/>The Metamorphosis: A quirky weirdo (Johnny Depp) is transformed into a giant cockroach for a battle against the evil Queen Verminia, (Helena Bonham Carter) for the rule of the Arthropod Empire.<br/><br/>Ulysses: Confused Irish weirdo (Johnny Depp) falls into a boat while cooking breakfast, resulting in a wild romp through Greek mythology, including meetings with the witch Calypso (Helena Bonham Carter) and the grotesque Cyclops (Johnny Depp)."
"ermhm","2","3","6","7 June 2011"," Alice in Burtonland with a touch of King's Speech
","Burton gets his inspiration from several sources, none of which is the original book (because it's hard to believe it is). One is Disney's 'Alice in Wonderland' which Tim probably despises for the overall happiness and subliminal messages – funny how the goal justifies the means as the same sword in different hands signifies a tool of justice, not crime. A major source is the video game 'American McGee's Alice'. Another potential source could be the Czech stop-motion movie 'Alice' (1988) by the renowned director Jan vankmajer – and while we cannot know for certain Burton even saw it, it servers as an example of just how different (albeit darkly toned as well) can another vision of the same book be. All these adaptations know what they want to say and how to say it. No hypocrisy. Burton's movie? It lies and it cheats, and it leaves a nasty aftertaste.<br/><br/>Whacky, burtonesque, johnnydeppesque makeup covers up a nationalist, chauvinist and racist structure with some very arguable messages. Underneath, otherwise very common and traditional values are found: open market, militarism, domination and oppression. This is shared by all popular fantasy blockbusters of today. Now, they all have elements which work splendidly on many levels. Even Burton's movie has its moments during the first half. It all falls apart though when you recognize what is being served to you on a silver platter with whispers of flattery to your ear. Narnia, Lord of the Rings, Alice in Burtonland. What do they have in common? Blind faith in the purpose of holy wars, noble leaders we ought to die for, old orders and hierarchies in need of preserving, ancient prophecies which instill fear and belief we need to fulfill them (so the circle can be closed and eventually start over).<br/><br/>/*SPOILER ALERT*/ All of this (and more) can be found in Burton's adaptation. Alice runs away from a reality where an arranged engagement is being forced on her, disappearing during the whole ceremony and coming back to Wonderland – first time in 13 years. She doesn't remember she was there before and believes it to be a dream. On her merry way she meets all the well-known characters and finds out her destiny is to once again defeat the evil that weighs heavy on the once beautiful land. To give a proper reason for it, ancient prophecy is presented (sigh). It turns out she has to find the Sword stolen from the White Queen, which will enable her to defeat the big and scary Jabberwock (another roaring black dragon, really). Jabberwock is a home pet of the mean and despicable Red Queen. White Queen is auto ironic as she parodies innocent and perfect Disney princesses. She is in fact disturbingly sexual when holding symbols of power in her hands: the Sword and later the Crown. In a 'thrilling' and 'breath-taking' crescendo the land is polarized, with two armies meeting head on. They meet on a huge chess board intended for mass blood loss in service of the queen and country, being (appropriately) amorphous masses of cards and chess pieces so the viewer can fully concentrate on the excitements of war. The main characters exchange some fierce and pain-promising looks (as if some kind of a prison fight is about to ensue) and then the 'spectacular' massacre begins. In the heat of the battle, nimble Alice cuts of Jabberwock's head. The scene ends with Captain Sparrow/Sweeney Todd/Mad Hatter (with whom we had to feel sympathetic earlier due to the dragon roasting his yard grass and a few friends along with it). He turns into comic relief while doing the Justin Timberlake robot dance. Wait, what? Seriously? After cheap moralizing and bad satire that trembles under the weight of its own spuriousness, we get CGI Johnny Depp's robot dance? And what a relief it would be if the movie by some miracle threw a big sign saying FIN here - it would then soothingly be just another empty and stupid Hollywood flick. But no. What comes after is much, much worse. Alice comes back to reality and (to everyone's surprise) informs her not-so- future husband she won't be marrying his sorry a55, and then tells her mother and aunt it's her life (it's now or never, she ain't gonna live forever) and the big decisions are her to be made. Then she confronts her almost-father-in-law (former business partner of her father) and asks for a professional meeting in order to discuss the future of their business. Wait, what? In a short and 'invigorating' conversation we find out she wants to get in the deal and broaden their markets by expanding to China, the unexplored land with untapped possibilities. The almost- father-in-law is overjoyed with her ambitious mindset, and so the next scene shows little Alice standing on a boat ready to embark for the far continent. A butterfly (the former Wonderland caterpillar) flies by her and Alice symbolically says good riddance to her childhood, accepts the harsh reality and becomes a fierce and daring industrialist/capitalist. Lesson effing learned.<br/><br/>That's the message of the movie then. Just like the king George VI. in 'King's Speech', the character with which the viewer is supposed to bond and identify learns he needs to stop being human – to become a man. It is a false liberation: Alice from the heavy regulated society, Red Queen from her own complexes, White Queen from political ineptitude, Mad Hatter from inability to act (but what action is that?). Personal liberation of George VI. in 'King's Speech' is false in pretty much the same ways: liberation from inability to force himself upon others, to dominate his inferiors (inferior by what and whose criteria?), liberation from the last speck of human dignity and conscience that stand in the way of success and power. Because, what kind of a man (or woman for that matter) can't get what (s)he wants by force, right?<br/><br/>Right?"

","Visually interesting but an appalling take on the story. The best thing about it is Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp but even they are held in check by the writing. This really is not Alice in Wonderland though - the title is just a peg on which to hang some sort of misdirected fantasy. If Burton wanted Gwynneth Paltrow why did he not employ her instead of a lookalike? One of the single most disappointing films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Lots of anticipation dashed on the rocks of Burton's vision. Sweeney Todd led me to believe that Tim could pull this one off but far from it. Crispin Glover's character had no business being in this and most of the cameo voices were wasted. Can no-one manage to make this story into a film successfully? Jonathan Miller came close but there is still a cigar to award to the first person to do it properly. Perhaps Pixar will tackle it one day - if anyone can do it they can."

The movie starts out with Alice at the age she was in the original CLASSIC (8 I think? i dono) but she asks her mom about some stuff she saw in WONDERLAND before going off to sleep and aging 13 years, cut to the 'present' with Alice on her wedding day and Alice sees a rabbit that no one else seems to see and follows him (from the Altar) down the hole (once again) and finds the table with the ""drink me"" bottle on it (but doesn't remember it....Did I mention that this is supposed to be a sequel to the original) and shrinks (again!) and is surprised by it, but thank goodness she finds the 'unshrinking food' again...meanwhile bodiless voices discuss whether or not she is ""the"" Alice (an important plot point) anyways she gets to be the right size and goes through the door to what can only be described as Tim Burton's dreamworld. Alice makes her way to the Caterpillar (again) then to the Chesire Cat (actullay I'm not sure of the order....) then to the Mad Tea Party (which is actually quite sane....like the rest of the movie....which doesn't make sense...this is wonderland) and Johnny Depp begins his countdown of how many times this film will reference the original (yes I am aware that it alludes to the book as well) but I guess my problem is that it's as though Burton had only watched the Disney CLASSIC and read the Jabberwocky poem....because this movie feels nothing like the book...or the CLASSIC for the reason. For brevity's sake I'll sum up the rest of the movie....Alice slays the Jabberwock peace is restored to Middle Earth...I mean Narnia...excuse me Wonder....UNDERLAND (phew) the evil queen is banished to another childhood classic..blah blah blah...but really Burton tries to make nonsense makes sense....and he dances upon Mr. Carroll's grave by doing so."

Yes, they might be corny at some times, but the magic and charm of the movies make them classics. However, Disney made a complete MISTAKE teaming up with Tim Burton. In the first place, I don't understand why anyone finds his movies interesting. They are dark, dull, and I turn them off every time.<br/><br/>The movie itself was one of the worst movies I have seen in years. First, the plot was confusing, boring, and had no sense in it whatsoever. Alice, a sullen teenager, stupidly trips down a very LARGE, unmissable hole, in which she falls to Underland? (????) meets up with characters from the past who seem sullen, crazed and lifeless. Thru the movie, there is a whole subplot based on Alice claiming that she's not ""Alice."" While this subplot leads on a confusing, jumbled pathway, she stumbles around lifelessly, completely unaware of what is going on. There was no color, the C-A was plain awful, and Johnny Depp made the movie ten times worse with his overacting. Additionally, Alice and the Hatter seemingly had some attraction deal going on, which made the movie just plain weird. It felt awkward and forced.<br/><br/>I finished the movie completely frustrated with the film. Probably the most exciting part of the movie was the last minute, in which there is a brief glimpse of blue color from the butterfly fluttering by Alice whilst on the ship. Honestly, I was never more excited in my life than to see a brief glimpse of color in this extremely dark, cold movie.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money, time or energy on this sad attempt of a twist on a classic book.<br/><br/>Note- If you have to see the movie, Don't take your children.

","Alice in Wonderland centers around teenage Alice who again travels to the magical wonderland she visited as a child. She has forgotten about it though and must learn about all the interesting creatures and cultures as she tries to save Wonderland from the grip of the evil Red Queen.<br/><br/>It's hard to say what exactly, but something definitely went very wrong during the production of Alice in Wonderland. They had a great cast as well as a great director who seemed perfectly suited for a visionary movie like this, but amazingly none of this ever really comes together right. Aside from some of the visuals and a few of the characters none of this really works much at all.<br/><br/>Aside from the poorly written script possibly the biggest problem would be the pacing. Characters and plot points are introduced at a such a break neck pace that it is very hard for any of it to really register in your mind. Every five minutes a new creature is introduced and then seems to just fade into the background as more characters are brought in. The viewer never really gets a chance to get to know or reflect on any of these characters and it's hard to find their motivation. Even Alice, who is the only two dimensional character in the film isn't even much of a character. Why does she care at all about the fate of Wonderland, I'm not sure.<br/><br/>The acting isn't particularly state of the art either. I didn't find Depp's Mad Hatter to be funny or interesting, just annoying. Depp is a very good actor and excels in creating interesting character traits and turning what would have been boring characters into the high point of an otherwise dull movie (Jack Sparrow). He doesn't manage to get that here.<br/><br/>The only reason I can find to see Alice in Wonderland would be for the visuals or if you are a huge fan of the original and just want to see Burton's take on the story. I'm not a fan of 3D, but if you are don't see it for that either. The 3D is not nearly as well integrated as in Avatar."

","Tim Burton's extension of the classic Alice in Wonderland story is definitely a feast for the eyes. Script-wise, however, it is a bit of a let-down.<br/><br/>The movie's first act is a humdrum experience for the most part. When we first meet Alice, she is a little girl plagued by ""dreams"" of falling down a hole into a land filled with various odd creatures. We then fast-forward 17 years later to find she has become a fanciful young woman wanting to break free from her uptight aristocratic society, one that expects her to accept a marriage proposal from a complete dweeb. Instead, she chases a waistcoat-wearing, pocket watch-brandishing white rabbit into the forest and falls down a rabbit hole.<br/><br/>For the the next few minutes, the movie plays out much like the usual Alice in Wonderland story (you know, ""Drink Me,"" ""Eat Me,"" shrink, grow, yada yada yada). It's when she finally arrives in Wonderland (oh, sorry... ""Underland"") where things take a completely different turn. As it turns out, the Red Queen has taken over ""Underland"" and has made life itself a living hell for everyone. There is doubt amongst the denizens of ""Underland"" that this Alice is the right Alice -- you know, the Alice that visited ""Underland"" as a little girl. This is kind of a big deal because this Alice is apparently the ""Underland"" version of ""The One:"" she is prophesied by some mystical scroll as the one who will slay the terrifying Jabberwocky and end the Red Queen's reign of tyranny over ""Underland"" once and for all.<br/><br/>During the first, oh, 30 minutes or so, I found myself more interested in the CGI (and the 3D) than in the story or the characters. That did change, at least to some extent: I actually started to care about characters like The Mad Hatter, Bayard the bloodhound, and the Cheshire Cat, as well as their roles in the story. But one character I never became attached to was Alice herself. I blame this mostly on Mia Wasikowska; her portrayal as Alice was, well... a bit dull, really. She began to bring a bit more life to the character in the third act, but that's a bit too late: for the rest of the film, she struck me as surprisingly one-dimensional. Considering Alice is the one with whom we're supposed to have the most emotional connection, Wasikowska's predominately one-note performance was severely damaging to the film. It's never a good idea for the protagonist to be the least interesting character in the narrative.<br/><br/>My primary issues with the picture, however, lie with the script. I felt the story was not as engaging as it should have been, or as it strives to be. There were a lot of truly enjoyable moments, buoyed by lovable characters and some creative twists on the original Alice stories. To me, however, it felt as though the script wandered back and forth between inspired madness and uninspired hokeyness; between moments of pure delight and moments of pure blah. Of course, it didn't help there was very little emotional interest between myself and Alice. Then there's the climactic battle, which, even though it looked cool and took place on what looked like a mega-sized chessboard, seemed surprisingly generic and out-of-place in this film.<br/><br/>While the story and script were fairly hit-and-miss, the visual aspect of the film was outstanding (which is to be expected in a Burton movie). The effects were amazing (for the most part), and the designs (like the armor worn by the playing-card soldiers and the aforementioned chessboard battlefield) were a mix of inspired originality and creative adaptations.<br/><br/>Aside from Wasikowska, the actors gave some delightful (if not particularly outstanding) performances. Johnny Depp is suitably zany as The Mad Hatter; he is indeed mad, but not to the extent that it interferes with his judgment (well, usually) or his humanity. Helena Bonham Carter is great as the sadistic Red Queen, depicting her not only as a short-tempered tyrant but as an internally vulnerable woman seeking love and acceptance. Anne Hathaway is fine as the White Queen, making her an elegant eccentric, leading one to believe she, too, has a touch of madness. Then there's Crispin Glover, who is awesome as the Knave of Hearts ... heck, he's Crispin Glover, he's always awesome. The voice actors also do great work, notably Alan Rickman as Absolem the caterpillar and Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat.<br/><br/>Like many of Burton's recent films, his Alice in Wonderland is really a mixed bag for me. It is at some moments (mainly in the beginning) dull and meandering, and at other times delightful and fun. A tighter, more energized script and an actress who can bring vitality to the lead role would have done wonders. Kudos to Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton for attempting to make Alice ""feel like a story as opposed to a series of events"" (as Burton put it) in an attempt to make it connect emotionally, but they were only halfway successful. Going down that rabbit hole was certainly not a horrible experience... but it could have been better."

","Sorry for my bad English :(<br/><br/>Don't expect much or else you will end disappointed, the movie is stronger in visuals than in story, in my opinion, a missed opportunity. Watch out, i am not saying is bad it just could been better, neither is good, is just a fun movie, unlike others by Tim Burton, this one i just didn't care for it, the storyline was lame and cliché, this proves Tim Burton has been consumed by ego and money.<br/><br/>The visuals are great, just extraordinary and make the movie a lot more exciting and are memorable. Something i liked a lot was the little details, like the characters in wonderland, are very alike the characters in the real world, that the eyes (the form, color and shape) of some characters change with in the movie, or that Alice uses lots of different dresses through the movie, it's just so Tim Burton.<br/><br/>The characters are memorable, my favorite being the Chesire Cat, but all of them are just great and so funny i will never forget them.<br/><br/>Alright the problem with this movie is the script, the original idea is OK, is fine, but the development of the movie is just so boring, it looks like a cartoon for kids and not like a movie, the jokes are just dumb and it's too cliché, the movie had potential, and they missed, this movie could been so much better, but well over all is a decent movie, one watching is OK, but don't expect much.<br/><br/>7.4/10"
"Electrified_Voltage","5","3","6","7 April 2010"," Has the great Tim Burton visuals, but basically everything else fails
","Before I went to see this version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" on the silver screen last night, I knew it was Tim Burton's latest film, and also knew that it featured more than one talented cast member who had appeared in previous films of his, including Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, who have both appeared in several of them. I had still never read the book by Lewis Carroll, and had only seen the most famous adaptation, the 1951 animated feature from Disney. Since I have very rarely found any of Burton's movies unsatisfying, his own version of this story sounded promising, but I then saw that it wasn't getting the best reception. It's a good thing I knew that before going to the theatre, or else I probably would have been in for an unpleasant surprise.<br/><br/>Alice Kingsleigh has been having strange dreams/nightmares since she was a little girl. At the age of nineteen, she attends a garden party where Hamish Ascot, the son of one of her late father's former business partners, proposes to her. Unsure of whether she should marry him or not, she soon notices a White Rabbit in a waistcoat going by and decides to leave everybody else at the party and chase after it! This leads her to a hole, which she falls down! At the bottom of this hole, she finds herself surrounded by doors, all of which are locked except one which is too small for her to go through. After a struggle, taking potions that make her shrink and grow, she finally makes it out of this room and into a mystical land called Underland, which appears to be the location of her recurring dreams! She meets a series of bizarre characters on her adventure in this land, including the White Rabbit, Tweedledee & Tweedledum, the Cheshire Cat, the Blue Caterpillar, the Mad Hatter, etc. Alice is in Underland to slay a giant creature known as the Jabberwocky and bring down the evil Red Queen! <br/><br/>Around the beginning of the film, before the part where Alice falls down the rabbit hole, I was already bored. Alice seemed like an uninteresting character, as did all the others, and the story seemed so lifeless and boring. This could have all changed after Alice falls down the rabbit hole, but sadly, it doesn't. There are excellent visuals and sets for Underland, the kind of dark visuals one can expect from a Tim Burton movie. Some of the characters are CGI figures, and this animation is also amazing. Unfortunately, these are pretty much the only things I liked about the film. I didn't care much for any of the characters, including Johnny Depp's portrayal of the Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of the Red Queen, even though I admire these two performers. It seems that both characters are supposed to be comical, but aren't very funny at all, and the same goes for most of the characters in Underland. They're generally just unfunny and bland. I occasionally smiled at some of the gags, I can't deny that, but for the most part, the humour fails as well. As an adventure film, it's not very exciting at all, and I found myself hardly caring what would happen.<br/><br/>In the typical Tim Burton fashion, this adaptation of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"" has amazing visuals and bizarre aspects, but unlike most of the other films I've seen from him, this one is not very entertaining. While his visual style consistently impresses me, it certainly isn't usually the ONLY thing I like about his movies, as I'm usually pleased with most other aspects of them as well. However, that wasn't the case with this film, and the stunning visuals are not enough to carry it. Not only that, the talented cast is oddly lacklustre here. I remember seeing both ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Corpse Bride"" on the big screen in 2005 and not being disappointed by either of them, but this year, when I went to see Burton's latest theatrical release, I was not very happy when I left the theatre. Now, I've certainly seen much worse than this, and many people who have gone to see this fantasy flick in the past month or so clearly weren't let down, but this is my review, and I have to join the naysayers, as much as I wish I didn't."
"freemantle_uk","6","3","6","1 April 2010"," A Hit and Miss film, and shows 3D is not the future
","Tim Burton is obviously is one of the most respected directors around, having made excellent films like Ed Wood and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barbar of Fleet Street. He had made films that have appealed to families to more adult-aimed films. But Tim Burton has also been a director who can also get things very wrong, like with Mars Attack and Planet of the Apes. With Alice in Wonderland Tim Burton directs a sequel to the Lewis Carroll story, and he is given us a film that has many good and bad points.<br/><br/>Mia Wasikowska plays Alice Kingsleigh, a nineteen-year-old woman living in the upper ends of Victorian Society. She is a intelligent woman, quick witted, but doesn't like living her surroundings. She is also a woman who from the age of six had a recurring dream involving strange creatures, likes a smiling cat and a blue caterpillar. After being proposed by a very wet fellow, Alice runs away, following a White Rabbit (Michael Sheen). Alice falls into Wonderland, believing she is in a dream: but their is a debate within the creatures of Wonderland if she is the right Alice. But since Alice last was in Wonderland, the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), had taken over and overthrown the White Queen (Anne Hathaway). It's prophesied that only Alice can stop the Red Queen's reign of terror, and kill her dragon, the Jabberwocky. To aid Alice she forms a group of allies, including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), The Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), the Dormouse (Barbara Windsor) and Tweedledee (Matt Lucas) and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas).<br/><br/>As stated Tim Burton is a good director with a wild imagination. With Alice in Wonderland is able to create a large, grant world with the aid of green screen technology. He shows a wide range of creatures, and even plays on the idea of a dragon. He design for the Red Queen is excellent, and the Mad Hatter's schizophrenia. But sadly this is also one of Burton's most heartless films, feeling like he was doing so he can do another project. They seems to be a lack of depth within this film and doesn't use the ideas this film created. Also some the the CGI was not as strong as it could have been. Alice in Wonderland has proved to be a successful 3D and along with the success of Avatar Hollywood executives are wetting themselves with excitement, hoping to have a money spinner with 3D. But whilst the 3D with Avatar took years of effort and had special cameras developed to film it, Alice in Wonderland was done retrospectively: with computer experts making the 3D from 2D film. But the 3D in Alice in Wonderland is weak in comparsion. It lacks the effectiveness, and many things were literally thrown at the audience. This shows that retrofitting 3D into films is not the future, and films like Avatar should be a rare treat, not the norm. The script by Linda Woolverton is not as a strong as it could have been. She doesn't use up all the ideas she created, and much of the characterisation is thin. She does try to write a fun film for all the family, with enough of a dark edge for young adults. But they should have been more fun in the film, and particularly more humour.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has found an excellent new star with Mia Wasikowska: a young Aussie with a great future in front of him. She is the best performance in the film, able to show Alice as a quick witted young woman who still has the clouds of doubt over her head. Alice is tough cookie in this film and doesn't want to be dictated to. Burton also goes to his regular actors, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. It is rare for Depp to give a bad performance, and with he does create a character who delightedly mad, and shows to have spats of anger. He even give the audience a good Scottish accent when made. But despite Depp and Burton saying they wanted to bring more depth to the Mad Hatter, they sadly fail to do this. Bonham Carter is one of the best actresses around and she is also good in the film. She makes a great villain, who is prone to anger issues, and her character is given more depth, having a longing to be loved and issues with her looks. But the Red Queen also felt like a superfisical character. The real waste in the film is Anne Hathaway. Hathaway does have a few good moments, particularly comedic moments, but her character is given little screen time, and again, little depth. An smaller name actress or a good comedian could have been just as effective in the role.<br/><br/>Overall there are good action scenes, and it should appeal to all but very young children. Mia Wasikowska shows she is an actress with a future, and there is enough or Tim Burton's die-hard fans to like. But this was a film in need of a stronger script."

","Ill keep it short as usual, since it is always better to see a film without any prior judgments or opinions, with an complete open mind.<br/><br/>This movie is a Tim Burton wet dream. Tim always makes a better movie (in my opinion) when he keeps to his own/original material ( scissor hands, big fish, mars attacks) not when hes taking ideas from other people ( planet of apes, Sweeney Todd, charlie % the chocolate) , but , strangely for me this one hits the mark. Charlie wasn't that bad, but it wasn't good either. this movie is like seeing charlie on speed. The time flew by, and what a ride it was!

"pulp_post","2","3","6","14 March 2010"," Bitter disappointment... or just far worse than expected
","It's just natural that great directors manage to acquire a good reputation and a sound name in the industry of cinema. However, sometimes that means a genuine quality and faithfulness to his/her own ideas and creativity (as it is the case of non-trendy directors such as David Lynch, Wim Wenders, Godard and many others), but sometimes it is just used as a commercial power to hype their movies. Still, maybe a movie can be that hyped and fully associated with special 3D CGI effects and still be good... but I soon feared that it would not be the case of this Alice in Wonderland.<br/><br/>This was not a film for Tim Burton to make anyway - as much as hight is the quality of most of his works, he never truly managed to create a original narrative structure in his works, forever linked to the emo archetypes in some sort of sweet dark fashion.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland is, however, a surrealist piece rather than a fantasy, therefore lacking the easy handlers of sword adventures - even though the monster and the sword indeed appear in Through the Looking Glass (the book), as a very short-story written in a medieval way that Alice finds and reads. It's a small detail in the whole book though and I'm certain that it was never intended to dominate the whole opus, or change the surreal tone of the story.<br/><br/>Unable to pursue the essence of surrealism (well, he might not even tried to) Tim Burton followed the easiest rout and transformed Alice into a Joanne D'Arc involved in a fight of good versus evil. Just plain as that, so frustrating as that - yet, a formula guaranteed to please huge audiences.<br/><br/>In visual terms it is equally disturbing - the 3D caused me headaches, while I noticed that some major problems were happening in the movie, like the whole perspective being often distorted, colours suddenly changing and the background losing all resolution all of a sudden.<br/><br/>If taken just as fast entertaining this movie can still be viewed, but cannot be compared to other Tim Burton's movies. It's just sad to see that happening."
"EskimoChain","8","3","6","8 March 2010"," Amazing Show..It's Alice In Wonderland In 3-D (although what critic wouldn't bitch?)
","If you go into this movie expecting the next ""Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Silence of The Lambs"" Take your popcorn elsewhere! This a great rendition of a great book. Tim Burton and the producers decided to take a new approach to this seemingly unrenewable tale. <br/><br/>For me at 23 it works while staying true to a very broad audience. With a pretty large budget and a Disney logo to stand aside, it played pretty bad-ass in my sight. <br/><br/>*I swear I have seen Alice in person (Mia Wasikowska)... Well she kinda has that familiar look, with an Aussie accent..anyway back to my critique<br/><br/>My only beef was the length, I wouldn't of minded a 2 hour and some minute (A.I.W.) but we all know antsy little kids so I might not get that one.<br/><br/>There wasn't a runt or slacker in the cast at all they played it true, to the true and strangely interesting world which Tim Burton Directs.Everything is indeed alive and moving. Even would be inanimate things. With faces and pulsating beauty, through great cinematography and images. Although no mushrooms for Alice in this reenactment lol.<br/><br/>Mia(Alice)played it kool with her wtf is going on attitude, as any 20 year old would. To be caught in such a reality and game. She kept it honest and moving. No surprise The Mad Hatter (Johnny) took his ticket to ride. Doesn't JOhnny Depp damn well always come up that thing or things that separates, yet ignites a sort of action that few have, I believe anyway.<br/><br/>At long last, applause all around, not meaning to leave anyone out. Well I may play favorites. Yet in a right state of mind I think everyone could enjoy this one! If they want to. Prety Good Pretty Good"
"dfranzen70","6","3","6","6 March 2010"," Fun to look at, anyway
","In this reimagining of the Lewis Carroll stories, Alice returns to Wonderland after a ten-year absence and finds herself pegged as the savior for the mystical land, now ruled with an iron fist and bulbous head by the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Tim Burton's film is, as expected, visually stunning and imaginative but suffers from a predictable plot and 3D effects that feel sort of unnecessary.<br/><br/>Alice (newcomer Mia Wasikowska) is now 19 years old and dreams nightly of her previous journey into Wonderland, but she has no memory of the actual visit. Her mother wants Alice to be married into a rich and powerful family, and at the beginning of the movie Alice and her mother appear at a posh to-do thrown by the parents of a snotty, dumb-looking suitor, who of course pops the question to her in front of a hundred simpering guests. But our Alice isn't ready for such a commitment to such a drip, so off she runs, comically falling down a hole in pursuit of the White Rabbit.<br/><br/>Once in Wonderland, Alice encounters several of the characters she met during her earlier visit: Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Cheshire Cat, the Blue Caterpillar, the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Dormouse, and the March Hare. It seems that the denizens of Wonderland have been awaiting Alice's return so that she can free them from the Red Queen's tyranny, something about a mystical calendar that prophesies Alice slaying the Jabberwocky. <br/><br/>As with most Burton films, this one is a real treat to watch. In fact, if you just turned the volume down and put your special glasses on, you'd be amazed at the jaw-dropping CGI. CGI gets a bad rap nowadays, as if it were always a short cut to actual acting. But here, I found the effects to be creative and wonderful to behold. Indeed, Bonham Carter and Depp have as much to do with their characters' personalities as the CGI does. <br/><br/>It might be that the movie doesn't lend itself very easily to 3D, but I think it's more likely that the script wasn't tailored quite enough to that technology. For example, the 3D Journey to the Center of the Earth, for all of its problems, was able to integrate 3D into the plot somewhat seamlessly, with boulders and birds alike flying toward the audience. Burton's Alice in Wonderland doesn't do that quite enough for the 3D to be really worthwhile. On the other hand, the pure animation of the movie is reminiscent of Coraline, and that's a very favorable comparison indeed. Wonderland here isn't meant to be some beautiful, pristine land; it's a land damaged by the touch of the bitter Red Queen, and you get a real sense of ominous peril.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the acting and voicing is really top notch. JOhnny Depp is always a lot of fun to watch, in my estimation, no matter how goofy his hair may be (and it's plenty odd here). Sure, he turns in the affected performance from time to time, like his Willy Wonka, but his Mad Hatter here is both vulnerable and heroic (something that perhaps Lewis Carroll hadn't envisioned). But Bonham Carter is absolutely stunning as the Red Queen. She manages to be both terrifying and hilarious at the same time. The Red Queen, full of vanity but desperate for acceptance, is at once the most charismatic character in the movie. <br/><br/>Another down side is that it seems to take forever and a day for Alice to even get to Wonderland. I think Burton spends a little too much time with the so-called outside world, at both the beginning and the end of the movie. What Alice's life is like outside Wonderland should be only of minimal importance to this story, I think. What matters to us is what happens to her in Wonderland, how she will persevere, who will she meet, and at which sizes will she be? It's helpful to know that Alice is about to be married to a selfish brat, but we don't need to spend 20 minutes on her outside-world situation.<br/><br/>A final debit is that the movie operates on two tracks: one is a fantastic voyage replete with beautiful and amazing creatures and things, and the other is a standard-issue save-the-downtrodden heroine plot thread. The latter could have been scripted by any number of minimum-wage screenwriters. It reminded me of all of those movies in which some plucky hero or heroine fights all odds (as well as a lack of strength and wits) and somehow defeats the evil menace. Alice is no Lara Croft; she's not even a Red Sonja. She's just a teenager who's not even sure if she's dreaming or not.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland does have its moments, but it tries to hard to mix a great children's story with a mythology and magic and kidnapping and revenge and other dark themes. And beware if you take children to see this. Even though it's a PG-rated movie, the film does contain a bit of violence, in particular a scene in which a baddie gets an eye plucked out."

There were some excellent special effects. The disappearing Cheshire cat was well done. The caterpillar making its cocoon was interesting. But this was not enough to make it worth seeing. I usually wait for movies to come out on DVD because of movies like this. I wish I hadn't wasted my money and time watching this in a theatre.

","I for one am a big Tim Burton fan, he's one of the best directors around in film. I love his offbeat use of odd faced characters, and dark backdrops similar to old classic German cinema techniques. Burton always seems to be the master of the sky the leader of the macabre as his oddball characters bring out the best of not only themselves but Burton as well. And this is proved in his films ranging from ""Batman"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Sweeny Todd"", and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". So I knew going in I would enjoy his take on ""Alice in Wonderland"" as he once again teamed up with Johhny Depp so I know the chemistry was present for some great work.<br/><br/>I probably enjoyed the film even more having saw it in IMAX as the crystal clear images and teardrop reflections of images flying right off of the screen was exhilarating to witness. I for one knew like most the plot and story of this literature classic even though I had never read Lewis Carroll's take. Even more fun was the kooky and colorful zany take that Burton would have. The story is typical taking place in London a young girl named Alice(Mia Wasikowska)thinks back to an adventure she had and enjoyed thirteen years earlier, and at the present she seems weighed and tightened down by family and a politically correct majority.<br/><br/>So with any typical fairy tale when a little bunny rabbit appears Alice is lead to a fall thru hole that will take her to a magical joyful land of new adventure and new characters! Alice's meetings aside from the rabbit include the March Hare, the smiling Cheshire Cat, and the awkward yet lovable chubby fellows Tweedledee/Tweedledum(Matt Lucas). To top the journey adventure off Alice meets the strange yet determined Mad Hatter(Johnny Depp)and this character reminds one of a Carrot Top in Kabuki makeup. It's the goal of all to slay an ancient dragon called Jabberwock which will fulfill a prophecy and free Wonderland from the Red Queen(Helena Bonham Carter). The power and a special item(a sword that slays the dragon)will be returned to the White Queen(Anne Hathaway, as this character is a spitting image of Snow White and Ginda the good witch). This tale clearly has similar themes to another classic like ""The Wizard of Oz"" as I just mentioned a comparison a few lines ago.<br/><br/>Overall this film is enjoyable and a visual treat to watch especially in IMAX it's your typical classic feel good literature tale of meeting new friends, good against evil, as along the way courage, thought, and love is learned. It's really a must see too for any Tim Burton fan as here he shot actors against green screens filling in the world with computer generated imagery. As clearly this is one film where the images and characters outweigh and outclass the plot and stories meaning."

","This was destined to be bad because Alice in Wonderand is unfilmable. Lewis Carroll had the attention span of a hummingbird. The book is non-linear and geared for the easily distracted. It needed to be rewritten to film it, but this? This is a crummy, extraordinarily feeble, go-nowhere, girl-power lecture that would have been pitiful & laughable 30 years ago. Anyone who gave this a high rating, has a very thin cliché index. The script is rotten. The story is barely fleshed out beyond the schematic. The pacing is glacial. The acting is a joke. Anne Hathaway is totally lost. She reaches 'high-school play' level acting and no more (ditto for Crispin Glover). Depp just adds one more affected freak to his resume.<br/><br/>Tim Burton wouldn't know a finished script if it bit him on the a.ss.

Although it's very colorful and rich in cute details, the story it tells is beyond boring. In Tim Burton's version, Alice is closer to C.S.Lewis' messianic tales than to the wit and subtle sauciness of Lewis Carroll's imagination. Mia Wasikowska, in the title role, is pretty, but entirely lifeless, not to mention her ludicrous accent. Johnny Depp has saved many mediocre movies, but even he can't sail a sinking ship. While he made ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" worth my while, he couldn't save the ""Chocolate Factory"", and he won't save ""Alice"" either. Whatever Tim Burton touches, it comes out sickly sweet. If Lewis Carroll were alive today, and making movies, he'd be directing something like ""Resident Evil"" instead. It's the story of Alice going under ground, after all.

The Bandersnatch was an amalgam of the Disney villains that turn out to be a nice guy at heart. The Jabberwocky was fearsome enough, but the battle scene was just silly, the ending known since the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Give this one a pass, as Lewis Carroll's Alice said when told there was no answer to 'Why is a raven like a writing desk?'. . . ""I think you might do something better with your time""."

","Alice returns to that wonderful world of wonder she visited when she was a child. This time with no memory of being there before. It is written that she will overthrow the evil Red Queen and return peace to the land.<br/><br/>The pairing of Tim Burton and Alice in Wonderland had a lot of people smile with big grins. It seems like a perfect match. Burton's visual flair would seem to perfectly fit this weird and wonderful world. People were right, Burton's vision is indeed what one would expect and it's the highlight of an otherwise uninspiring film that feels flat and weak. <br/><br/>As a Depp/Burton film, it lacks the originality and freshness of their prior works. Depp is wonderful in the role of the Mad Hatter, but at the same time it feels like we've seen this performance before. Depp usually seems to disappear into his roles, but his mannerism are really apparent here. It felt like he took bits of Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka, then made it a little bit more insane. It works, but at the same time it feels old. <br/><br/>As for Alice, the relatively unknown actress Mia Wasikowska is boring, bland, emotionless and the wrong choice for Alice. It was hurtful to have her try and carry the film, she couldn't. On the opposite side of the spectrum. Helena Bonham Carter is outstanding as the Red Queen. She stands out in the film, which is full of hit or miss performances. <br/><br/>The CGI fits the fantasy element of the story, but at times they feel a bit too cartoony. This takes away from the weight of the characters and you immediately know that it's too fake, even for this fantasy world. While the film is visually pleasing, the story is severely lacking. I found myself wanting the film to end a bit sooner than it did.<br/><br/>The 3-D in this film was pretty bad. My experience with 3-D films in theatres have been G- Force, Avatar and now Alice in Wonderland. Out of all three of those films, this one comes in dead last. I found it hard to concentrate on certain things, as others had motion blur and it hurt my eyes a bit. Avatar is 3-D done right, Alice is 3-D to sell tickets.<br/><br/>Fans of the original story might find this one a bit lacking. To equate this film to another one in Burton's catalogue, it would be around the same level of Mars Attacks! or Planet of the Apes. A mediocre film with a few good elements. As a whole the film will please the young teenage target audience that will gush over Depp and love the visual style. But those looking for a good entertaining story, you'll be disappointed."

","This film is about Alice returning to Wonderland after she has grown up, and faces her true destiny as described by the magical scroll.<br/><br/>""Alice in Wonderland"" is the first film I watched in 3D. When they played a 3D trailer of ""How To Train Your Dragon"" before ""Alice in Wonderland"", I thought 3D looked very good. Everything looked so real and so layered. When the actual ""Alice in Wonderland"" film came on, I was very disappointed. The 3D was not obvious at all, especially in real life scenes. This was not helped by the fact that most of the background in many scenes were blurred, which made the 3D less pronounced. There are only a few scenes that the 3D was obvious, such as when Alice falls through the hole, or when the White Queen prepares a magical potion, but you can tell these scenes exist only for the sake of showcasing the mighty 3D technology.<br/><br/>Though ""Alice in Wonderland"" may have trademark Tim Burton fascinating visuals, it still cannot make up for the underwhelming plot. The story is less than engaging, with little ups and downs. The attempts to make jokes fall flat, while ""off with their heads"" are too overdone. I cannot help but feel disappointed by ""Alice in Wonderland"", which I am likely to forget in a short while."

","The first thing that you notice when watching this movie is the extreme use of visual effects. It seems the film makers hoped by throwing a lot of vivid colors and crazy looking people at the audience, they in turn would not notice the utter piece of crap from a once good director (who hasn't had an original idea for a movie in years). Now I have not read the Alice in Wonderland books, but have always been interested in the story, so I won't attack how faithful this movie was to the source material. Although Mr. Burton did say himself that this movie was merely inspired by the books.<br/><br/>First off like many people I was interested in seeing what Johnny Depp's Hatter would be. Instead I got Captain Jack Sparrow who can't figure out what accent he should use American, English, Scottish, Irish, and for some reason a random lisp that disappears most of the movie, Next we have Helena Bonham who's performance might have been good (I can't remember because all I could think of was how fake and stupid that head looked) as far as Ideas go making her head large may have been funny, if it didn't look as fake as it did. Then we have Crispin Glover, surprise he's playing a creepy character again, gotta love the range. His performance was also thwarted by terrible visual effects, how can the LOTR make a large man look tiny yet years later we cant add just a foot or two to Crispin Glover without making it look like someone did it in photo-shop for a high school project.<br/><br/>But the main thing that surprised me about this movie was Anne Hathaway. It takes a lot to make her not look beautiful, congratulations Tim Burton you have succeeded! Why does every woman in a Tim Burton movie look like a corpse? I am not a necrophiliac, i do not find pale woman made up to look like a corpse attractive, So Mr. Burton please for the love of god stop doing it."

","Once again, someone takes a timeless story, with wonderful characters and a really cool plot and sells it out for a predictable, silly, action film, where the Mad Hatter becomes a love interest. Come on! The film begins with an amazing world created with great care. The images are almost startling in their lushness and complexity. So what happens. You take the Alice in Wonderland canon and take all the starch right out of it. Johnny Depp is great to look at, with his colors and his aberrant behavior. At some point, it all falls apart. A war between the white and red witches takes center stage. It is made obvious that Alice must fulfill her destiny by killing the Jabberwock. She begins to ally herself with benevolent forces. The queen who is visually interesting but really boring begins the ""off with her head"" stuff. Anyway, by the time the thing was over, I just didn't care. I'm a firm believe in story and this one doesn't have an original bone in its body. How sad. And I really enjoy most of Tim Burton's output."

I, being a huge Burton fan (who's seen all his movies, most of them more than once and also liked and understood them), was expecting this one to be epic, given the talent attached to it (c'mon, how can you go wrong with a starcast of Depp, Bonham Carter, Hathaway and Crispin Glover being helmed by Tim Burton, the greatest creative mind in Hollywood). What I got was about an hour and forty minutes of crap. And I don't blame Burton or the actors for it; I blame the SCRIPTWRITER and the PRODUCERS (read Disney, godknowswhat they're gonna do with Marvel). Well, here's what I liked about the movie : THE GOOD 1. Great performances from the star cast 2. Great visuals (as expected from a Burton movie) 3. Amazing music. Maybe its the best part of the whole movie, or maybe I'm a Danny Elfman geek.<br/><br/>Here's what made the evening hell for me : 1. Waste of talent 2. The script.

Don't expect any Lewis Carrol's surrealism here: this movie is basically good/evil battle as in ""Chronicles of Narnia"", using Carrol's personages (it's not reaching the story level of Lord of the Rings). Nice cartoon, but for anyone searching for Alice in Wonderland ecranization which has to deal with the actual book(and style of the book), i highly recommend 1988 movie ""Neco z Alenky"" by Czech director Jan Svankmajer.

","Starting out, I really had no expectations going into this movie. I'm a Tim Burton fan and find everything he does to be extremely watchable -- I even loved the Planet of the Apes remake and Charlie & The Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>This, however, is not one of his best movies. It has nothing to do with the out-of-place dance from Johnny Depp, although that does hurt the film.<br/><br/>It's the fact that Burton is using now-staple of fantasy movie actors, like Christopher Lee and Alan Rickman. They performed admirably except they don't have much to work with.<br/><br/>You expect to feel a connection to the characters or the story -- but you really don't. It feels like you are watching recycled epic scenes from other movies like Lord of the Rings, Narnia & Harry Potter. Alice in Wonderland is not about any of that. It's not about 'heroes' banding together to save Wonderland. It's about a messed-up girl who doesn't quite understand this world or Wonderland -- what you see is what she sees. Yet, she didn't seem surprised by any of it and neither were you. The ending was telegraphed in advance and didn't really lead to any surprises. I really wanted to see a plot twist in the movie -- such as the White Queen is really Alice, but grown up.<br/><br/>But instead, she slays the creature and that's it. A touching moment with the Mad Hatter and she's back in the real world.<br/><br/>If you want a movie with childhood literature reimagined, get Finding Neverland or Where The Wild Things Are. Those are lot better movies and more deeply moving than this. I think if Tim Burton did Alice in Wonderland more like those movies, it would be a lot better. There is a brief scene at the end that connects the characters in Alice's world to Wonderland, but too little too late."
"joestank15","5","3","7","6 March 2010"," Incredibly pedestrian given the subject matter and the director!.
","Alice in Wonderland - Alice (Mia Wasikowska), now 20 years old, is being forced into an arranged marriage and decides to escape again to Wonderland. She finds her old band of weird misfit characters, The Hatter (Johnny Depp), The Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), The Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman), who all seem to know each other this time around. Team Alice must take on the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and it is up to Alice to slay the mighty Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>Of all the good directors to lose their touch, Burton's descent is probably the most interesting. Don't get me wrong, I love Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Big Fish, and Sleepy Hollow very much, but Burton has undeniably lost his touch over the last few years. A man always attracted to images, he has always enjoyed the imagery of horror but not necessarily the pathos behind it. Motivations and details tend to elude Burton's characters and their worlds in his works. Burton has gotten frankly lazy with his casting over the years. Now, in Burton's seventh film with Johnny Depp and his most eye popping yet conventional film yet, it is clear that Burton is comfortable in just letting the imagery and Danny Elfman's music do the dramatic work for him. If I found parts of Sweeney Todd boring and emotionally vapid, it had nothing on large chunks of Wonderland. There is not an ounce of drama to be found anywhere. Now I ask why would a man who has admitted to not being familiar with fairy tales or good scripts, desire to do Alice in Wonderland? If one had large chunks of time to spare, they could go over what a weird mistake it was to put Alice, whose original adventures ARE the archetype for the woman's adventure, squarely in an archetypal male's adventure of achieving their destiny by slaying a dragon. I mean really, what was the point of rebooting Alice just to turn it into Narnia? This is not entirely Burton's fault. Linda Woolverton, who wrote The Lion King, is also behind this.<br/><br/>If there is one place where schmaltz, logic, conventionality, epic battles and foretold prophecies/destinies, should be forbidden, it's Wonderland. Gone is the political satire, the wackiness and the randomness of Wonderland. Mr. Burton, good lord but what were you thinking? Mia Wasikowska is completely lacking in charisma. I liked some of the things Depp tried to do with Mad Hatter, even if a random Scottish accent appears sometimes and a horrendously inappropriate hip-hop routine comes out of freaking nowhere at the end. Ironically, trying to give the Hatter depth was a huge mistake. Stephen Fry is pitch perfect as the Cheshire Cat. Alan Rickman's voice is similarly great for the Caterpillar. Helena Bonham Carter raises the performance level some with The Red Queen. Anne Hathaway looks vacant and sashays around as the White Queen. The film is beautiful, and Burton fans will be satisfied. It is, I repeat, a shallow conventional Wonderland. Alice in Wonderland gets a C-."
"NarniaIsAwesome","1","2","4","1 March 2019"," Alice in Wonderland is... Inexplicable and Freakish!
","Written by Lewis Carroll in 1865, 'Alice in Wonderland' is the story of a sweet but smart little girl who travels to a strange dimension called Wonderland, where some cute and some crazy creatures bring her to defend her sane knowledge, and ultimately stand up to a corrupt Queen. This movie... is not that story.<br/><br/>In this version, it is more like a sequel. Alice, now nineteen, escapes back to Wonderland amidst an unwanted proposal. Once there, her old ""friends"" - and when I say friends I mean nightmarish CGI monsters - celebrate her return because it means she will slay a dragon. Alice, however, believes and hopes she is merely dreaming (you and me both, girl).<br/><br/>There is actually no problem with the plot or characterization, because there is none!!! Director Tim Burton was obviously too busy making sure the cast was detached and the visuals were nauseating to worry about that.<br/><br/>Along for the insane ride is Johnny Depp, the King of Insane Rides. His interpretation of the Mad Hatter is even more mad and less comical than that of the book. Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen is incredibly annoying and has absolutely no charisma. Anne Hathaway is also somehow irritating as the White Queen; she suffers from ""Sickening Sweetness."" Crispin Glover also stars as the Knave of Hearts who works as the right hand man of the Red Queen (she was his last hope after 'A Match Made in Space' didn't sell many copies). And finally we have Mia Wasiikowa... or Wasakowki... Waiokaski... oh, whatever! as Alice, who can only be described as pale.<br/><br/>As for the CGI characters, there is a mouse named Mallymkun. But don't get excited - this isn't a cute, fun mouse. In fact, this mouse plucks out eyes. To be honest, I really don't know if it's male or female. The Tweedles are... stupid at best. And the hookah smoking caterpillar, Absolem, who was utterly confusing and slow in the book, has now become an Aslan-like voice of wisdom. Then there's the Cheshire Cat, who is creepy but somehow steals the show.<br/><br/>If you decide to watch this film, beware. It is disturbed, deranged, and dare I say offensive? But if you do decide to view, make sure you have sufficient headgear and other protection to avoid stray pieces of insanity."

Frankly, i wouldn't want my kids to get involved with this loud violence against others. I prefer that movies teach them about breaking their own inner fears. Tim failed to bring something original to the audience, totally drowned by CGI. Danny delivers an uninspired score. Pairing again Depp and Carter is totally boring.

","It seems that the answer to movie piracy is to make movies not for niche audiences but for everyone for the whole world to see. But trying to be liked by everyone comes at a price. Any artistic ability the director may have has to be lost as it may stop in making more bucket loads of cash. And it's not like its a surprise. It is Disney after all, who loves making remakes, adoptions and sequels. And usually they are all rubbish. But perhaps this would be different. It is directed by Tim Burton, who can actually direct. But it does not feel like a Tim Burton movie as it contains none of the dark themes or imagery that made Charlie and The Chocolate Factory a good movie. You may say 'but its a kid's movie' but movies aimed at children can be dark. All worst aspects of pop culture are present in this movie. The need to be generic, the need to choose style over substance and the need to be producing a big heap of money. This film falls flat, in its boring execution of action sequences, its stylish production but its lack of it being memorable and the badly and frustrating 3D.

"terrellrobinson71","9","2","4","3 March 2011"," You don't like this movie....Off with your head!
","Tim Burton's classic adaptation of Lewis Carroll's masterpiece ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a wonder to behold, a miracle and above all, a very thrilling, hilarious and heartwarming family romp that has muchness, just like the book itself. In Burton's version of ""Alice"", the Alice that we all know and love is now growing up in the almost 19th century. She is 19 years old and played by the beautiful Australian Mia Wasikowska, (The future Jane Eyre). Facing a lot of reality after her father (Marton Csokas) died, she is stuck in the old British society that a young girl is supposed to get married to a heartless and rich jerk, in the case of that it's Hamish Ascot (Leo Bill). When she impulsively leaves her engagement to Hamish, she sneaks out and followed the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole and is back to her childhood dreamworld, Wonderland--or in another case, Underland, run by the vivid and seductive giant head (no, literally) Red Queen (Helena Bonhan Carter), whose famous catchphrase is ""Off with his head"", (This line is an utterly comic genius) and, along for the ride, her precious Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover), working as her bodyguard. And like the book itself, she runs into a very unfriendly tea party run by The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp, as usual, the characters he play are over the top, exquisite and underachieving) who provides her some plans on a journey to take back Wonderland with help from the White Queen (Anne Hathaway, pretty in white) and to defeat a dragon-like creature named the Jabberwocky. With the same characters you all know and love, a new re-imagining plot and luscious cinematography mixed with breathtaking special effects, this winner of 2 Academy Awards is a treat that is a little too violent for a PG rating(due to its spectacular battle at the end, and a few inserts of swords going through creature's eyes and decapitation), but with Tim Burton's unique imagination--and with Johnny Depp's Scottish accent--what else can you think about? The cast including Wasikowska as a very special Alice, Depp as a wacky Mad Hatter, Carter in Bellatrix Lestrange mode as the Red Queen, Hathaway in her beautiful gracefulness as the White Queen and Alan Rickman's smoking caterpillar is truly phenomenal. I have a sister who saw it twice and she was really impressed with this movie. Even though, I read the book, I was really imagining Wonderland as if Tim Burton must have done it. It's a real fun time for you and your kids and if you don't like it....then again, how about this....""Off with your head!"""
"thetimegivenus","6","2","4","29 December 2010"," Weirdest Film of the Year
","Wow. Wow, wow, wow! Alice in Wonderland is definitely the weirdest film I've seen in a very long time. It was very different than the book (which, mind you, is not necessarily a bad thing) and also contained elements from Carrol's second book, Through the Looking Glass. But if you're expecting a pleasant re-telling of Carrol's classic tale, keep looking.<br/><br/>The Story: Alice Kingsley is a nineteen year old girl who's really not sure of anything about her life. She's troubled by a recurring nightmare set in a strange place called Wonderland. When she first had the dream seventeen years ago, she explained it to her father and asked him if she was going mad. He rather humorously replied that she was and after a brief pause added, ""but all the best people are."" Now, seventeen years later, her father has passed away, leaving Alice's mother to run the family and find Alice a suitable husband. When the young man proposes, Alice is not sure what of to say so she runs away and, after finding a white rabbit with a waistcoat and a watch, she follows him back to his hole which, she quite naturally, falls down.<br/><br/>And thus Alice is introduced to the strange world of Wonderland, or Underland, as she finds out later it is really called.<br/><br/>Soon Alice finds out why she has come back to Wonderland. The Red Queen has overthrown the White Queen and is currently terrorizing the inhabitants of Wonderland. A mysterious magic scroll clearly foretells that Alice is the only one who can defeat the monstrous Jabberwocky on the Frabjous day. So everyone is looking to Alice to save them.<br/><br/>Yet Alice still thinks it's all a dream.<br/><br/>The Good: Most of the technical aspects of this film were quite good. The entirety of Wonderland must have been 3D and they did a good job creating a visually interesting world in which to place their characters. On a similar note, most of the 3D characters were very well done, with only one (the bandersnatch, for those of you who were wondering) looking obviously fake to me.<br/><br/>They also did a pretty good job of keeping Alice fairly modest, despite the fact that she was constantly shrinking or growing out of her clothes during her stay in Wonderland.<br/><br/>Tim Burton (the director), is quoted to have said that he didn't care for the original books because they were about a little girl who just wanders around from one strange place and adventure to another. Not much of a story. His version of Alice in Wonderland didn't seem to start out much better. But, fortunately, it changed. About halfway through the film Alice begins to take control of her life and, despite the fact that she was predestined to fight the Jabberwocky, she does have to make the choice to go out and do it. A rather interesting (though weak) example of predestination versus free will. She also chose to return to her world in the end, despite the fact that by doing so she would have to face all the problems she had left behind her.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have also mentioned that, towards the end of the film, Alice was a good example of heroism and I would tend to agree. She was willing to risk her own life to save the lives of others. Now, I personally would prefer to keep ladies off the battlefield, but nonetheless her actions were heroic.<br/><br/>The Bad: While this first point is not bad per-se, it is worth noting. This is not a children's movie. The book may have been for children, but this film is not.<br/><br/>The entire thing is set in a strange, mysterious world full of odd and sometimes terrifying creatures. Heads are lopped off, Alice receives some rather vicious scratches, and there's a terrifying dragon-like thing that breaths out electric fire. It get's rather violent at times. At other times, it's just plain weird.<br/><br/>There's also a completely unnecessary kiss at the beginning of the film which implies an adulterous affair. It's sort of portrayed as bad, but not as clearly as it should be.<br/><br/>If you want a list of the problems in this film, Dove's review is pretty thorough.<br/><br/>There is one rather important thing that Dove forgot to mention. Feminism. At the end of the film Alice comes back from Wonderland ready to take control of her life. She gives some endearing little speeches to her friends, joins her father's company as an apprentice, and sails off into the sunlight. ""I am woman, hear me roar!"" It's really kind of sad that they decided to end it this way. While in Wonderland Alice learned several fairly important lessons that could have been nicely tied together to make a very good ending.<br/><br/>Conclusion: The effects in this film were very well done. The acting was good, especially when you consider that many of the characters were 3D, and thus weren't even on set. Unfortunately, the message was not great, so I cannot recommend this film very highly."
"jcleveland","6","2","4","30 November 2010"," Very disappointing: bad writing, unlikable characters galore
","When I heard this movie was coming out, I was intensely excited. I didn't actually get to see it until today. I just need to point out a few things. I found a ridiculous amount of characters totally unlikeable. Tweedle dee and Tweedle dumb were just plain creepy. The dormouse was obnoxious, and I know she had a name, but I couldn't understand what it was that Alice kept calling her. The characters all interacted like they were long time buddies in a way that made me feel like the awkward new kid in a crowd of new people I barely know. I found Alice's character a bit dry at worst. That being said, I actually found Alice pretty likable, as well as the hatter and the hound dog. While it's hard to label the red queen as likable, Bonham-Carter did a pretty good job with the character.<br/><br/>The writing was okay at parts, and i did chuckle aloud a few times. But a lot of it was just plain bad. For example, when the hatter is ""executed"" and the cheshire cate appears with his hat, the dormouse says ""Ches, you dog!"". I couldn't think of a more cheesy awkward line than that. There are probably better examples, but that is the line that stood out the most to me.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie was good, but not great IMO. Toward the end when Alice is fighting the jabberwocky, I could actually see where the animation was manipulated for the 3d effects. I found this odd and it looked very strange since I was only watching in 2D. <br/><br/>I bet this movie would have been 100 times better had they just made a creative rendition of the original Alice in Wonderland instead of trying to create a whole new story."

","Tim Burton really knows how to deliver a very unique story with a dark tone which make it all the more interesting and realistic. I loved the tone of them film as it added drama and suspense to the film. The CGI effects were really good and the whole film was visually appealing. Tim Burton really captured the concept of Wonderland and allowed us to be transported into that world to escape from reality. The characters were really good: Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter (he really engaged into being a fickle character and you really liked his character) Helen as the Red Queen (Bold, sharp, evil, a very good portrayal of the Red Queen) Anne Hathaway as the White Queen (initially hard to relate to, as the film progresses her character becomes more appealing) and Alice (not the strongest character but still a character worth taking notice of) and all the rest of the characters were enjoyable to watch. However i wish they focused a bit more on the world of Wonderland. It is a place of strangeness, fantasy and imagination yet the film focused little on that aspect and instead on how Alice is finding it hard to remember when she was least there. Of course its great Tim Burton paid attention to character and plot but maybe with the added value of exploring the surroundings and taking in the imagination and fantasy of it all would have made the experience much better. But all in all a very enjoyable watch with action, substantial characters and great effects! (plus its a clean movie which is great)"

To see frogs and fish in waistcoats among other visions, and a beautifully realized Queen of Hearts, and the grotesque and dark side of the Wonderland vision come to life -- thank you Tim Burton for realizing that aspect of the vision! But the other deviations from the original are uninteresting. And less than Carroll's invention. The story sucks.

Sure, I thought right off the bat that we didn't need another Alice story, but since it was Tim Burton, I didn't object. I mean, after the masterpiece that was Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Burton's previous film, and the generally good films he's made before (i.e.: Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and The Nightmare Before Christmas) I didn't completely go into this film with bad expectations. Oh boy, was I wrong. I guess the higher you go, the farther you fall.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland, a gimmicky, over-written, comical ""fantasy"" film that exists for no other reason than to come up with stupid and irritating 3D shots. Sure, it wasn't awful. I really should give it two stars, but I add the half just because of the visual style of the film.<br/><br/>Here is the gist of the outrageously dumb plot. Alice Kingsley (why does she need a last name?) is a put-upon young girl who dreams and goes against convention all day. She refuses to wear a corset (a nineteenth century feminist) and doesn't want to marry an odd-ball red-headed snob. Then, at a party one day, she sees a rabbit in a waste coat and carrying a watch. So she chases it. This looked great in animation, but in real life it looks dumb, so now I'm thinking ""What a moron! Chasing after rabbits!"" So then of course, she falls down a hole and into Underland. Then the film really goes wild, into the visually fantastic but indulgent fantasy world known as Wonderland. Now the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) has stolen the crown of Underland and ousted her sister the White Queen (Anne Hathaway). So then the film degenerates into a cat fight between these two colorful females.<br/><br/>Now, the problem with Alice in Wonderland is that it tries to make a logical story out of an illogical book. In Alice in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll, it is a fragmented and episodic story with absolutely no meaning whatsoever. Here, the plot is Disneyafied and given a linear and meaningful plot. We had to through in an action climax and make the villains villainous and make Alice a sensible person. The film is so generic and dumb. There is nothing original in it at all. It's the silliest thing I have ever seen. If Tim Burton had been aloud to hire his own screenwriter (instead of the Disney hireling, Linda Woolverteen) and to make this a darker, bloodier, and more Gothic-type story it would have worked nicely. And if it had been a remake instead of a sequel to the original it would have worked better. But no, no, no! We couldn't do something that might scare the kids! The directing is not up to Tim Burton's standards either. YUCK! The film is riddled with shots that run a long way over the landscape of Underland and then rush up on something long and pointy. This is of course to make the 3D effects worth-while. I'm with Roger Ebert. 3D is idiotic and pointless. If Disney would do like they used to and make original and new kinds of films, I wouldn't be so hard on them, but they have fallen into a rut of mediocrity that stems from the desire to do nothing but make money. So they hire screenwriters to write the same action/adventure horse manure that dominates the cinema now. But now I'm ranting. Back to the review.<br/><br/>After the first thirty minutes of this hour and a half long dust bunny, I began to feel bored and annoyed at the direction the film was going. What could have been a dark, gruesome fantasy masterpiece was turning out about as generic an action/comedy as you can get. I just don't get it. Now you can read all sorts of reviews. Critics won't like it. The common folk will love it (or at least the teenage girls will).Tim Burton can do better than this. I don't know who convinced him to do this effects-ridden freak show of a movie, but somehow they did, and the result is not pretty. But enough of this. Here is just another pointless movie that won't stand the test of time. My advice: skip it. If you have whiny kids at home, go see it just to appease them. But I just don't understand this movie, I never will, nor will I try to understand it.<br/><br/>Now, of course the movie is not entirely bad, or I wouldn't have given it the rating I did. The whole look and production design of the film is very Burtonesque. The bright, zany colors contrasted with drab, almost black and white shots in the next frame. It's a beautiful film to look at, with lots and lots of eye candy. The way some of the characters are designed and the way the colors interact with each other is certainly pleasing to the eye. But all the beauty of production design can't make up for the lost story. Danny Elfman's musical score isn't bad either, although it can barely be distinguished amongst some of his other scores like Edward Scissorhands or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This is a good example of what is wrong with cinema today. Instead of being focused on entertaining a wide audience, the studios monopolize on this same story line over and over again to attract little kids and teenage girls. If you ask me, stick with the original Disney animated version of the Lewis Carroll story. That is a film that will stand the test of time.<br/><br/>www.colewebbharter.com"
"Generic_Gooner","7","2","4","7 April 2010"," Alice back in Wonderland, but not entirely wonderful
","Tim Burton films guarantee you 2 things: 1. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are likely to be found in the cast list. 2. There will be a Gothic undertone to it.<br/><br/>But for me also Burton has this tendency to be a bit hit or miss. And Alice in Wonderland sort of falls between the two this time around<br/><br/>*Warning, minor spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>Firstly, although the 3d was a nice extra there really was no need for the 3d. OK, this could be the argument for any film now in 3d, but unlike say Avatar this film really did not blend it in seamlessly. There were moments where it felt like the 3d enhanced a scene, like when the hat was thrown, etc. But in general felt far more gimmicky than some films using it have. <br/><br/>Visually the mood and the setting was brilliant, it was supposed to be a dying Underland and it felt like just that. The CGI of the scenes could be argued to be too cartoony, but this is a dream like world and that idea of being so far detached from our reality that Alice never at any time believes it to be anything but a dream. <br/><br/>Keeping with the CGI the characters who were heavily created by this medium were also very crisp and believable, even the almost putty like tweedle Dee and tweedle dumb. The level of CGI characters also helped with the use of varying sizing of characters throughout the film. <br/><br/>On the sizing front I personally thought this was a feather in the cap to subtlety with an extraordinarily difficult thing to do in film. The argument again could be it was almost showing off, but at no time was there a size issue with Alice that didn't make sense, and as such it worked nicely. <br/><br/>The characters in the main worked too, with Alice being a very solid character playing the dazed and yet independent lead. Depp is Depp, its almost like he is ad libbing his role and the rest of the script is written around it, but I really cannot fault his portrayal of the Hatter. The March Hare was comedy gold for me, as this is meant to hold some juvenility to it being a child's story. The Red queen was an impression of Queeny from Blackadder II but this was fitting to her attitude and mannerisms. The white queen was almost parody in itself with the deliberate stance she took continually of this pure and graceful person. Even the Knave of Hearts had value to the flow of the tale <br/><br/>And now to the said story itself. It was nicely woven as a nod to elements of what it was supposed to be a sequel of, but somehow it was almost like the premise outweighed the plot line they had decided apon. It was like Burton and the writers had thought 'what a wonderful idea, bringing Alice back to Wonderland now I suppose we need a point to her return big dragon to slay? Yeah, that'll do, lets get some lunch.' <br/><br/>My apologies for the negativity, but I did feel like I was more interested in each individual character (Fry's Cheshire cat was the best of the bunch for me, and Rickman as the Blue Caterpillar? A masterstroke!) than the final scene. But of course when I criticise the plot thread I try to think of what might have worked better, and alas I really couldn't think of anything beyond maybe this novice fighter Alice showing that courage by standing up to the bully of the Red Queen, which may have felt more honest as a finish, but would have never been as epic as a final scene as the Jabberwocky's involvement. I did also find the last part back in reality to be very much a 'lets wrap this up guys, we have a plane to catch!' sort of speed But ultimately more necessary than just ending it without it, so I cannot really write a better conclusion <br/><br/>So all in all, the film was slid but really the premise was on a higher plain than the plots spine, and as such it suffers a little in the rating from me."
"crazybilby","6","2","4","3 April 2010"," Not a Disappointment Burton's Best or most Imaginative
","I liked the character of Alice. She was a very interesting character and did really seem more like Alice when watching the film than she did when viewing the trailer. The red Queen also seemed very much queen like.<br/><br/>Other characters felt either empty or not as interesting or right to me. Something about the Cheshire cat just didn't seem quite right, and it was weird as they all ended up having names. Also, characters (such as the white queen) seem to appear to have some form of personality, but just don't seem real or full which wouldn't be a problem if it was the original story of Alice in Wonderland but Burton tries to turn everyone into more believable characters and it didn't work too well in some cases. Not a total disaster, the Mad Hatter turned into more than just a raving lunatic obsessed with tea.<br/><br/>Burton almost seems to give a sense of order and logic to wonderland. It's weird seeing a Tim Burton film that seems to be trying to be NORMAL instead of weird! Wonderland becomes a linear and ordered place where you can go from one spot to another with no trouble of things changing dramatically or getting lost if you turn around. It lacks the imagination and surrealist absurdity of Alice in Wonderland that it should. It starts off the same as the original and then diverges quite drastically.<br/><br/>But it's not a failure of a film. It still had an interesting plot, a few laughs and some imagination. It's still entertaining to watch and visually was quite vivid and interesting. The CGI was not groundbreaking, but it had style. I liked the specific look that they went for and it didn't look camp or unrealistic (well yes, unrealistic as it's wonderland, but you don't go ""that's just stupid""). The ending was happy. It was good. But Burton really didn't hit the mark on this one like his previous films."
"noriu-balandeliu","8","2","4","2 April 2010"," The most sexual children's film ever
","Well, I enjoyed it. I really did. Having read the reviews, I expected something truly bad. What I saw was certainly not the best film ever, but a pretty decent watch. <br/><br/>There were of course ups and downs for the film. Let's start with downs, as there are fewer of them. First, I was glad to see that there were few so-called ""cute moments"" (e.g. snipe playing with Russell in Up) so characteristic of all Disney and Pixar films, and many modern day children's films in general. But there still were some, and this is a downside.<br/><br/>Sometimes the plot was hard to follow, some things started happening out of nowhere. In the end, it turned out the plot was pretty straightforward and I missed a bit of mystery / surprise in the story. Generally, the character development, the ""wtf factor"" and the deep thought behind the story was still nowhere near Carroll's talent, but then again, Carroll was an exceptional man. <br/><br/>The good things now. The visuals are stunning and beautiful, although I already start to hate the computerised fimmaking. But I guess that is the industry's problem. Mia Wasikowska as Alice is great. She is just the Alice you could imagine, and act very much like Alice.<br/><br/>But my favourite thing about this film is its sexuality. Guess why Alice has to be 19 all of a sudden? So that you can make all the sexual subtleties. Alice's growing and shrinking constantly makes her change dresses and on one occasion even leaves her naked. The dialogue addressed lesbianism (""she was loved by men, by women""), both the bad guy and the Hatter showed sexual interest in Alice, etc. I love how subtle these sexual things are. It's like the creators are winking at us, telling don't worry, kids are not bright enough to get the point.<br/><br/>Finally, I love the feminist ending :) it's a great message that you should not let others (your parents especially) decide what to do with your life and that you can achieve something what others couldn't have hoped for."

","This was an OK movie. I wish Tim Burton would make a good movie because after all, he is very morbid. However, this movie plays out more like a kids movie than anything. Gone are the days of Beatlejuice and the like. I like the part of this movie where there were special effects. In otherwords, most of the entire movie. I hated the way the white queen moved around gracefully and I hated the cards who looked like Cylons. I did like Tweetle Dee and tweetle Dumb because they looked so expressive. I liked the way the queen had a big head and that one scene where the Catapillar blows pipe smoke was funny. I didn't think Johnny Depp's character was dark enough. There were a few scenes where his voice changed but there was really no violence. I mean, that queen yelled OFF WITH THEIR HEAD over 10 times but I never saw any blood."
"p-stepien","6","2","4","15 March 2010"," Alice in Hollywoodland. The Sequel
","Alice returns to Wonderland following the clock-ticking nicely attired rabbit. However all that she remembers from her previous encounter is in the form of vivid dreams. This time around Alice is brought back as a saviour of the realm corrupted by the madness of the Red Queen. The land has fallen into ruin and the blood-hungry rule has blocked out the joy. Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) has been patiently waiting at his tea party for the return of Alice. However Alice has grown and forgotten, which throws doubt among the other dwellers of Wonderland as to her true identity... Only the Mad Hatter casts away any doubt...<br/><br/>The moment I heard that this movie was being crafted by no other than Tim Burton one thought instinctively came to mind: Here is the person born to make Alice come to the big screen. Coupled with the tremendous talent of his two muses: Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter I held the distinct feeling that this may yet be Burton's masterpiece. Sadly after an inspiring start to the movie it all goes downhill with the aid of dumb-downed comedy punches, thickly spread saviour plot and conventional Hollywood type story-build. This movie is a far cry from what Coraline managed to achieve - a relatively wacky story delivered in a new murky-dark package accessible for kids and adults alike.<br/><br/>After the initial awe of the world into which Alice has been thrown you slowly settle in to the story itself. Similarly as with Avatar the plot just does not do itself justice. Instead of crafty and wacky we have a sub-par Sunday movie plot. The two stars of the picture - Helena Bonham-Carter and Johnny Depp do their best to make the movie different and refreshing, but Mad Hatter is severely overused and well... not mad enough (I actually had the impression that Mad Hatter was faking his madness).<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is rushed and bordering on insulting. I agree we don't need a Return of the King ending, but plot solution was handled extremely poorly. It could have been excused in a movie from a lesser director, but I feel Burton probably got trampled over by his producers with the ending to make it sweet, pretentious and dumb.<br/><br/>What didn't help me in the slightest is the Polish dubbing of the movie I watched. Especially the local Polish comedy actor (Czarek Pazura) dubbing Depp is appalling."

Now 13 years later, and Alice(Mia Wasikowska) a beautiful mature young woman, falls again in that same hole, and meets up The Mad Hatter(Johnny Depp), some talking animals, the evil Red Queen(Helen Bonham Carter), and The White Queen(Anne Hathaway).<br/><br/>Tim Burton brings an old tale, and gives it a retelling, mixed with a sequel. And it was quite visionary stunning, the way Tim Burton knows how to direct it. The special effects are just incredibly good. And the performances of Depp, Wasikowska, and Hathaway are amusing. But Carters character I felt could have used more work. But still an entertaining film."

","Alice brings a sense of Nostalgia to the viewer as they see their childhood favourite character at an older age. I will start by saying that the film looks very good. The characrters are well done and flow well; the cat in particular, well he really is quite good. The backdrops are fun and the characters are well integrated between real and CGI(except for the tea party scene- the windmill looks like a stage backdrop rather than a movie). If nothing else, it is pretty. Not Avatar pretty, but still very good. Now onto the story. I am afraid, it needed some work. I quite enjoyed most of the scenes and liked how the story was aranged. The 'real-world' scenes were quite enjoyable and fun to watch especially. But one scene in particular brings the entire movie down. I am not sure why, but it seems that every writer and their dog must put a dragon into their movie. The entire scene with the dragon and the armor and sword to fight the dragon was no good. The kitchen scene prior involving the armor was though. I know the climactic battle added length to the movie and strength to Alice, but it was boring and the same old same old. NOT timeless at all. But the rest of the movie on the otherhand deserves a first and second and even third viewing, and was well written. She (the writer) did a good job making a new story out of old material, and it will please both seasoned Hatters and little Alices. <br/><br/>If you like drogons and not-so-great of battle sequences, this is a must watch. If you don't, it's still well worth it, but take a bathroom break when they get to the enlarged chess board."

","This beautiful quote in a way is the definitive moment of the film that encapsulates its triumphs aswell as it's flaws. I have a really personal and sensitive connection to the idea of this film rather than the film itself I think. As soon as Sweeney Todd wrapped up production, this was announced and for those 3 years in between I was obsessed with how great Todd was and how amazing this melding Of artistic genius in Alice was going to be. The hype in my own brain killed it in a way and I remember being pretty damn distraught after watching it from the disappointment. Its a perfectly fine film but considering the talent behind it, it falls short. I think ultimately it comes down to a muddled script; it feels too forced particularly in the opening half an hour, to cram as much Carroll references as possible and to be weird for the sake of it instead of capturing the magic of the source material. Then it tries to make sense with a battle-themed plot that undermines the characters richness on their own. I think if it just stayed with the original plot (or lack thereof!) then it could have been a much shinier piece. It almost sickens me to say all this due to how important it was to me beforehand so I'm going to balance it a bit; it's not without it's entertaining moments! Alice (Mia Wasikowska) falling down the rabbit hole gave me chills, The Tea Party where we meet the Hare (Paul Whitehouse) and the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) is beautifully done and could've stayed in that place with those characters for much longer. The visual effects are impressive and provide shots of real beauty. When there's a lot of action on screen however it can look too artificial and, as the Hatter would say, loses its 'muchness' along the way"

","I can't imagine a fantasy world more suited to Tim Burton's visual stylings than the insane place known as Wonderland, created by Lewis Carroll. I've often heard people criticize this film, and I can't figure out why, because I think it's actually one of Burton's best movies. It is a marvelous thing to behold, and has some wonderfully over-the-top performances. I also loved how they used the CGI in order to accentuate those performances and make things look a little off. Instead of entirely fabricating a Queen of Hearts, they have Helena Bonham Carter deliver a hilarious performance and then inflate her head to insane proportions with the computer. Even when things were entirely practical, there was an otherworldly style to them, like Anne Hathaway's playful performance as the White Queen. The one grounding force of the film is Mia Wasikowska, who is charming and comes across as normal, but gets gradually changed by the magical oddity of Underland.<br/><br/>The one downfall of this adventure of Alice in Wonderland is the inflation of the Mad Hatter's role, simply because Burton has a love for Johnny Depp. His character is relatively inconsequential in the story, but is forced in more often than anyone needs. There are even moments when the movie stops its forward progression so the Hatter can have a scene in the limelight. I'm all for broadening the characters in this story to make them resonate more, but I think it doesn't work that well here. Otherwise, this movie works great. But all of this should be taken with a grain of salt, because I have no affinity for the original animated Alice in Wonderland. What delights me about this movie is that it injects an actual plot into the seeming drug-induced nonsense of the original. Plus, it does all this without unwriting that movie, but implying it just happened in the past. I feel like I'm in the minority on this one, but Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a movie I'll gladly watch again anytime."

The plot begins with a marriage proposal to Alice, who then follows a rabbit down a hole and embarks on a journey involving magical creatures and surreal characters, such as the mad hatter and the queen of hearts. It uses an interesting mixture of real acting and computer generated images. In a way Alice is a character I can relate to because she is learning about the world by meeting new people. I am really glad I watched this film and would like to visit it again at some point in the future."

","Twenty-five years in the directing business from Beetlejuice (1987) over Batman (1989) and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) for Warner Bros. Studios, Tim Burton finally arrives at Walt Disney Pictures with an mega budget of two hundred million dollar and favorable Hollywood star Johnny Depp in the male lead as Mad Hatter to adapt Lewis Caroll's book classic with every possible special visual effect engine available in movie season 2008/2009 to deliver an instant classic picture for the whole family with wonderful memorable characters as a magical blue cat, a smoking caterpillar and show-stealing red queen, portrayed by actress / director's wife Helena Bonham Carter as main character Alice must encounter all of them in dream-like, neo-medieval landscape of digital splendor, so that audiences around the world could not resist the visua charm to elevate the Walt Disney Picture of an new age in the ""Billion Dollar Club"" at international box offices."
"HotToastyRag","3","0","0","13 June 2019"," Swirly and colorful, but disappointing
","There have been so many film adaptations of Alice in Wonderland, both before and after Disney's iconic cartoon, it's really no surprise that Tim Burton finally got around to making one. And, since it's a Tim Burton movie, it's no surprise that Johnny Depp takes the lead and Helena Bonham Carter plays the Queen of Hearts.<br/><br/>When you scan the cast list, you might find some choices you think will be perfect and entertaining, like Alan Rickman as the Caterpillar, Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, and Michael Sheen as the White Rabbit. Watching the movie proves to be an entirely different experience than the one you envisioned, since every single person in the movie seems to have been given the direction, ""Say your lines as differently from the Disney version as humanly possible."" Alan Rickman, with his beautifully famous voice, said his lines quickly and clipped. Not only was it not at all what audiences have come to associate with the Caterpillar, but it's a waste of his soothing, mimicable voice.<br/><br/>Mia Wasikowska stars as Alice, and rather than playing the role as a curious little girl with an intricate imagination, she's a sullen teenager with a chip on her shoulder. Her lack of energy is a stark contrast to the rest of the vibrant film, and it doesn't mesh well. Johnny Depp is his usual ridiculous self, relying on makeup and weirdness to fool the audience into a state of admiration. Helena Bonham Carter takes a leaf from his book, thinking the audience will be so focused on her digitally altered head than her acting ability. In all the versions of Alice in Wonderland I've seen, I don't know if I've ever seen a more lackluster, disappointing Queen of Hearts.<br/><br/>Some of you will love this version. The special effects and swirly, colorful Wonderland will make for a fun afternoon. I'll stick with Disney, or if I'm in the mood for real people, the 1933 version.<br/><br/>DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. This is Wonderland, so expect some swirling visuals and moving camera shots that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""

"qatrunnadanahifah","10","0","0","15 May 2019"," The background of some of the opposing characters is not clearly explained
","Yet another bizarre film from the mind of Burton, Alice in Wonderland is a pretty good film with its furthering of the original plotline seen in the original novels. Rather than Alice falling down the rabbit hole and discovering Wonderland, or Underland as it's actually called, for the first time, she's returning to a place that she once believed to be a dream. With the amount of people who know the original story and are familiar with all of its trappings, this has the essence of an interesting sequel without it actually being one as the film outright shows as well as cleverly alludes to what happened the first time she was there along with what happened after she left. Rather than just being a series of bizarre happenings and meetings, this moves beyond that. It becomes a cohesive story where the characters must make right what once went wrong and in this case, that's Alice becoming the foretold champion and ending the Red Queen's reign of evil by slaying the Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>Notably though, its depiction of the Jabberwocky is where the film eventually falls a little bit short. Here the audience is presented with a monstrous character, one that's practically made for the kind of film Burton makes. But all that's delivered is a short battle and two lines spoken by the character before its tongue is cut off. Not only is this a waste of a character as there could have been so much surrounding it such as why he sees the Vorpal Sword as an enemy, why he sides with the Red Queen and is loyal to her and why he sleeping by the battlefield, but it's a waste of talent as well considering the voice actor was Christopher Lee. This doesn't even go into how the creature in the original poem was called the Jabberwock.<br/><br/>At the same time, while Alice is a good character, her arc leaves a bit to be desired as well. The idea of a girl bored with the stiffness and rigidity of the expectations regarding her behavior in the Victorian era is nothing new and was explored in the 1951 film. Here though, Alice's character is established as having the same innovative and explorative spirit as her father which is why she doesn't like putting up with the rigidity and that's only furthered by the path that fate has pushed her towards in Underland. As a result, when she gets back to the real world, Alice bucks the expectations, gives the idea that her father's ideas weren't enough and pitches the idea to expand trade to China, which the Lord Ascot goes along with. All of this is a great idea and is a good basis for a character arc. However, none of it feels fully formed and it seems like the film only went halfway, such as how Ascot immediately goes along with Alice's idea unquestioningly simply because he believes Alice is her father's daughter.<br/><br/>But even with the partial formation of Alice's character arc and the wasted utilization of the Jabberwocky, the film does have a great visual design that's quite indicative of Burton's style. The other characters are all fun to watch as well, from the madness and insanity of the Mad Hatter, which Depp is able to portray very well, to how much of a tyrant the Red Queen is. Despite its problems, the film is still enjoyable."

","Although I like Tim Burton's style and in this movie it appears clear and evident, as a recognizing sign, I didn't like it. The rythm is very low, he chose again the same actors as usual and there is no suspense at all.

"deej-martin55","8","0","0","23 March 2019"," Amazing family movie!
","Alice in Wonderland is an amazing family movie, it's a movie fit for both, adults and children. Alice (Mia Wasikowska) expressed to her mother, Helen Kingsley (Lindsay Duncan) that she had been having weird dreams of herself lately. During her dreams, she ends up falling into a dark hole, after she lands she begins to see many strange creatures throughout her journey through the hole. Alice isn't aware that this place is the magical Wonderland that she has visited before at a younger age. As Alice and Helen approach the garden/engagement party of Hamish (Leo Bill) and Alice, Alice notices a white rabbit in coat, one that looks much like the one from her dreams. She couldn't help but to follow the rabbit into a dark hole where she discovers that it is up to her to put an end to the Red Queen's (Helena Carter) oppression.
The theme of this movie is growing up. Alice is now at the age that she is becoming a woman and she is expected to get married and eventually start her own family. Now that she's at this age she doesn't recall visiting Wonderland as a child. As it relates to the theme, Alice had grown up since here last visit to Wonderland therefore she looked different than before. Once Alice reached Wonderland the white rabbit (Michael Sheen) told the dormouse (Barbara Windsor) that she was the real Alice.
Legally Blonde (2001) featuring Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods also represents the theme of growing up. Elle was dumped by her boyfriend for another girl who appeared to be more serious than Elle. After this moment, reality hit Elle and she began taking life much more seriously. She embarked on her journey to law school to prove how serious she was.
In relation to the theme, two motifs in ""Alice in Wonderland"" are identity and curiosity. Alice is seeking to discover her true identity; she doesn't quite know who she is as a person yet. All she knows is who people are constantly telling her she should be. For instance, her sister Margaret (Jemma Powell) points to their aunt and says ""you don't want to end up like Aunt Imogene (Frances de la Tour) do you?"" Her mother and sister are both trying to push her to marry Hamish but Alice isn't sure she wants to. Alice is curious about what life would be like if she didn't dive directly into the married life with Hamish and perhaps followed in her father's footsteps by running his business of making trades in China. She decided to follow in her father's footsteps and decline Hamish's proposal despite the family's wishes. This shows how Alice transitioned to a grown up from the beginning to the end of the movie and learned to make her own decisions, instead of following the path of others."
"haubrockaz","4","0","0","13 March 2019"," Wrong Title for a Bad Movie!
","The title is literally the only thing that ticks me to the core. First off, Alice returns to Wonderland... wait, it's not Wonderland at all! It's Underland! So wouldn't the title be ""Alice Returns to Underland"" instead of taking the original title from the classic cartoon, which this movie isn't even a remake to begin with??<br/><br/>This alone just proves that Tim Burton's done; he's out of ideas. What's even worse, he's directing the remake of Dumbo, another Disney classic! If he screwed up with this movie, it's most likely that he'll screw Dumbo up, too!<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the visual effects are great, but the story is supposed to be simple and fun: Alice goes around, exploring WONDERLAND and its citizens. Simple as that! Not a prophecy and a war story! That's not what Alice in Wonderland is about! This movie would've been fine if it was something that Burton himself thought of like he did back in the day! But it's obvious that his creativity is gone. And don't get me started with his constant gloomy atmospheres, same music, same two actors, and only zombie-like people. First couple of movies is fine, but it gets old really fast if you keep using the same elements and styles in other films!<br/><br/>So in short, this movie isn't worth watching, especially with a name that has nothing to do with the movie."

","5 March 2010. When two A-Stars - Johnny Depp and Ann Hathaway, as well as noted actress Helena Bonham Carter with help from Alan Rickman can weave a supportive role to propel Alice played by Mia Wasikowska into a starkly rich focus, the brilliance of their acting shines with maturity. The rich and fascinating set design rivals and perhaps exceeds that of AVATAR (2009) though perhaps not reaching the imaginative level of The Lovely Bones (2009) and the storyline from start to finish maintains an intimate and substantive personal development character. Both Depp and Hathaway bring a finely honed performance and facial execution that speak thousands of words in silence. While the pacing is a bit slow in the first fourth of the movie, the unique fantasy world, Depp's embellished but finely submerged persona bring forth an effective fusion of special effects, animation, and real actors that meshes in this fantasy world - avoiding the necessity of 3-D or finely detailed animated authenticity in all manners much to better affect. There is humor, edgy drama that never crosses over into mature rating overload. In sum, this is a sparklingly fantasy has captivating action and features that brings imagination to the big screen. However, a second viewing, revealed that the stunning first impression didn't extend as much a second time, downgraded from 9 to 8."

","""Alice in Wonderland"" (2010) is a professionally produced adventure fantasy about a teenage Alice from the original animated fil, played by Mia Wasikowska, as she returns to Wonderful to unknowingly fulfill her destiny and reveal her true self. I was extremely skeptical of this film upon its original release having enjoyed the animated version as a child. I was pleasantly surprised that this film didn't try to completely remake the original. Instead, it took a familiar story and expanded on the possibilities. I really enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>Tim Burton executed a great film that simultaneously reminded me of being a child while introducing me to something new. The acting was superb, and the graphics looked realistic. So much so, that I almost forgot the mesh between real life and CGI. There were noticeable hiccups that made little sense. For example, the heart shaped eyepatch worn by Stayne, played by Crispin Glover, alternated between red and black. I believe this was intentional, but very distracting. Overall, I found this film to be very entertaining and enjoyable. I would recommend this film to both those who have and have not seen the animated version, but inform those familiar with the original to curtail their expectations of the animation being brought to life."
"karenmarrs","8","0","0","3 October 2018"," A look at themes
","Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is back in Wonderland, 13 year older, and with high expectations of saving the kingdom from the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). But is she the right Alice? Not everyone can agree on this point. The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) says she is. The Blue Caterpillar (Alan Rickman) says no. Will she slay the Jabberwocky for the White Queen (Anne Hathaway)? She does not intend to, at least at first. But will she change her mind as it becomes more and more apparent that Wonderland is counting on her?<br/><br/>The theme of Alice in Wonderland is that of standing up and doing what you know to be the right thing, even in the face of oppression. Alice has to make a decision between fleeing and standing to fight. No matter what, there is going to be a battle. Alice's involvement can sway it towards the end of oppression. However, this means facing her fears and doing the right thing, which is never easy.<br/><br/>In the end, Alice makes the right decision and dons her armor to fight. She is the White Queen's champion and does battle with the Jabberwocky. In doing so, she proves to everyone that she is the right Alice and she is willing to do what it takes to save Wonderland. A testament to this theme is the philosophy Alice carries with her to battle about doing six impossible things before breakfast. As she lists out the impossible things that have happened in Wonderland, she acknowledges that they have been building to the sixth item, which is the slaying of the Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>The use of color is well placed to demonstrate the theme of good versus evil in this film, and Alice standing up to the evil. The evil queen is the Red Queen. The use of red brings to mind the flowing of blood. ""Off with their head!"" shouts the red queen. Meanwhile, her sister, the good queen, is the white queen. The use of white indicates a certain amount of innocence and purity. <br/><br/>An additional theme in the film is that of growing up. The Alice we know from her childhood adventures is 13 years older now, and starts the film convinced that it was all a dream. In her decision to save Wonderland, she is making the call as an adult that she could not have made as a child. Then in the real world, she is also facing down a marriage proposal to a man she does not love. Before her adventure into Wonderland, she is torn as to what to do. Once her adventure is through, she can turn down the proposal with confidence and in fact, helps taken on the mantle her father left behind, as the head of a trading empire.<br/><br/>The pacing of the final fight is a real treat. Alternating her list of six impossible things, with the actual opening moves of the battle, helps build suspense. Will she succeed in being an agent of change for Wonderland? She has agreed to be the champion, but can she accomplish the slaying as the prophecy foretells? The battle is well paced and it is as if you are watching Alice grow up and into her destiny before your eyes.<br/><br/>Yes, she is the right Alice. Yes, she will step up as champion. Yes, she will slay the Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this film 8 stars as it had some great moments in it and an all star cast. It's not Tim Burton's best, but it is still a fun story and a great movie for the family."
"SarkastikAssassin","6","0","0","29 September 2018"," Visually Disappointing?
","I really like this movie, I do. It's fun, it's charming and it is SO Tim Burton-y. <br/><br/>But the major problem with this film (aside from Mia Wasikowska's performance) is that is is very visually disappointing. I think the movie's whole aesthetic is to try to present this wondrous, crazy world to us, but most of the time it just looks... ugly. 
The special effects are really not that great, even by 2010 standards, and it's a little distracting at times. 
A few sets do look nice, however, like the Cheshire Cat's tree and the White Queen's castle, but aside from that, most of the design just falls short. <br/><br/>Decent film, poor design. 6/10"

","""Alice in Wonderland"" by Lewis Carroll, directed by Tim Burton (whom I love), starring celebrities like Johnny Depp (whom I adore), Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Stephen Fry, Alan Rickman and legendary Christopher Lee, with technical capabilities of year 2010 and a $ 200 million budget ... You can not blame me for having high expectations. And when you see this wonder of wasted potential you won't blame me for being disappointed either.<br/><br/>The film is visually impressive and I really have no complaints, but everything else is lousy. Tim Burton didn't really fail, but we all know that he can do it much much better. Mad Hatter is one of Depp's weakest roles, Mia Wasikowska is sweet and she played Alice quite decent, and only Helena Bonham Carter really made an impression on me. The story is cute but lousy, it's not boring, but it doesn't engage you as much as such adventure should. You will not have the urge to turn off the movie, but you will not be upset if you need to leave it in half. However, I'm not sure how much is that the fault of unimaginative screenwriter and director (it certainly isn't Carroll's fault), and how much is this actually result of this being Disney movie primarily intended for children, which imposes many limitations. But the fact that the film is intended for children is just an explanation, and not an excuse for a naive, shallow and too simple story. A quality movie for children should be multilayered, on the first glance simple enough to entertain children, but with a certain depth that will intrigue adults. This movie doesn't have that. If you are out of elementary school you're too old for this.<br/><br/>6/10"

"mirkobozic","4","0","0","5 June 2018"," Nonsense&nonsensibility
","I guess it was just a matter of time before Burton decided to do his own take on Lewis Carroll's classic tale of nonsense&nonsensibility. It's safe to say that production-wise, the whole thing was in the best of hands, since Burton is known for employing characters like those in Carroll's book all the time. The costume department did a magnifficent job- the Hatter and the Red Queen look exactly as one would imagine them to be, with Helena Bonham Carter as the one who takes the cake for the best job in the cast, with her frantic, hysterical antics and hilarious lines. Johnny Depp is becoming increasingly annoying with his constant insistence on quirky characters, personality-and-costumewise. Mia Wasikowska was a good choice for the leading role, with her long blond hair and delicate features. That being said, the one thing that turns all of this into a mess is the fact that Burton tried to ""adapt"" the original story to the Hollywood standards and introduce a plot into a book that's famous for a lack of one in the traditional sense. If you go, go for the beautiful details, otherwise a bit of a disappointment."
"slightlymad22","8","0","0","17 March 2018"," I Was Wrong About This Movie
","Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come Alice In Wonderland. <br/><br/>I was put off watching this movie, as I never liked the book, and then I saw Depp's look and I decided it was not for me. Following the financial success of the Pirate movies and Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, I was starting to suspect, every movie maker and studio head were giving Depp carte Blanche and he was running amok, seeing how far he could push things before he was reigned in. So last night was my first viewing of the movie.<br/><br/>I was wrong about this movie. Burton delivers a charming, brillian interpretation until a silly ending almost ruins everything that came before it. Burton is a brilliant visual artist, and his film is a pleasure to look at. (I wish I'd seen it in 3-D at the fine a nkw)<br/><br/>Mia Wasikowska, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway and Matt Lucas are all human or human-ish versions of themselves and are instantly recognisable. There is voice work from Stephen Fry, Christopher Lee, Bsrbabra Windsot and rounding out the Sweeney Todd reunion with Burton, Depp and Bonham Carrer is Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall. <br/><br/>I was totally wrong about Depp too. He is a rare actor who can treat the most bizarre characters with perfect gravity. Whoever he plays (Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd, Captain Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka, Ichabod Crane), he is that character through and through. I've mentioned his expressive eyes before, they are used to full effect here. <br/><br/>Now on to the bad. The final act disappointed me why did it need an action sequence at the end?? We've seen every possihle battle sequence, every duel, all the showdowns and all the too long fights to the death.<br/><br/>Why does Alice in Wonderland have to end with an action sequence?? Did the executives think audiences would be disappointed without one?? It seems totally out of place and out of tone.with the rest of the movie. Thankfully it was not enough to totally spoil my enjoyment of it. <br/><br/>Alice In Wonderland grossed $334 million at the domestic box office to end the year the 2nd highest grossing movie of 2010. Beating the first Despicable Me and Iron Man, Twilight, Harry Potter and Shrek sequels. Only Toy Story 3 grossed more."

"Horror-yo","7","0","0","12 January 2018"," Burton makes Alice in Wonderland and it's better than you'd initially think
","Firstly, I'm no Lewis Caroll fanboy nor a connoisseur in any quality of the original novel so this review contains nothing in relation to whether the film was true to the book and what not, it's a movie review purely about the movie: Alice in Wonderland (2010) directed by Tim Burton and starring Mia Wasikowska whom since they've been brought up both do a very efficient job in my opinion for their respective tasks: Alice is strong-willed, has lots of presence and character and that's precisely what her role is about: a free-thinker in a world of formatted prudes who's not afraid to let her imagination and peculiar personality thrive. I also think that young Australian actress fit the character physically as she was not only pleasant to look at but conveyed that strong will while not being boorish either, just that fine line: a feminine tomboy with the slightness and freshness of a young girl.<br/><br/>And now about Burton: he does well to recycle the Alice story and keep it exciting and bring enough elements to it that it's something new to look at, rather than just being another Burton or just another Alice iteration. 
The film is structured and paced just right running in at the standard 1 hour 45min. Each scene is memorable and distinct visually, the dialog very good and punchy, often funny, and it never lets itself become self-indulgent. All the secondary characters and sprites are very well crafted - Johnny Deep as the Mad Hatter, those two plump boys, the Jabberwocky (voiced by Christopher Lee as an easter egg), both Queens are fantastic (and hilarious in their own way: Anne Hathaway and her deliberately annoying princess-like mannerisms holding out her hands like a fairy and coming close to throwing up a few times - and Bonham Carter's anger tantrums and ridiculous head), the Cheshire Cat... the tiny frog subjects of the queen and their deep voices...<br/><br/>Stylistically the film is quite awesome: from the very cool design for the card soldiers, to generally the sometimes barren sometimes hyper-colorful and rich dreamy landscapes with that thick hard contrast filter throughout, to the way they depicted for instance the phonies with their caricatured overly large features...<br/><br/>All in all, a job very well done. Obviously however one looks at it, it's still mostly crafted on an original story and inspired by a few earlier versions.
7.5/10."

","Burton-Carter-Depp trio once again pleases. The film is better than it should be -- I completely enjoy it with every watch.<br/><br/>The story is very much similar to the 1951 Disney Cartoon (minus musical numbers but the ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Bat"" song). Basically, if you enjoy the famous trio and love fantasy (Disney) then you should like the film - if you haven't seen it yet then what are you waiting for? The usual: Sets, costumes, blending of colours, good story, great cinematography etc... and well seasoned cast really makes the film worth while.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","Summary: An epic new twist on an old classic *** This review may contain spoilers ***<br/><br/>""Alice in Wonderland"" is about a young lady that falls down a hole and has a grand adventure. Although the theme of the film stays true to being character focused, Tim Burton's version differs from Walt Disney's version in the way that Alice, played by Mia Wasikowska, does not fall asleep and dream while reading a book. She has adventures, she mistakes for dreams, throughout her life to groom her for Frabjous Day. On Frabjous day, Alice is to battle the Jabberwocky and kill it to stop the Red Queen. The Hatter, played by Johnny Depp, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, played by Matt Lucas, White Queen, played by Anne Hathaway, and White Rabbit, played by Michael Sheen, all help Alice along the way. <br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland is a character focus themed film as Alice is the focal point of the plot. She arrives just in time to save the day! The clothing they used for Alice sets her apart from the rest of the characters, as appropriate since she is not from there. The armor Alice wore was vastly different than all of the other guards, making her stand out from the rest in a heroic way. This use of costuming further accents the theme being focused on Alice. <br/><br/>The camera angles used in the Jabberwocky battle scene, coupled with the choreography of Alice's battle movements, making it an epic fight and accents her as being the hero. The upward angles used as she walks down the stairs after killing the Jabberwocky make her look tall and champion like. She fights with smooth well thought out movements. The close up of her when she rolls out of the way of the Jabberwocky's foot after being knocked down added to the shot and excitement. <br/><br/>The computer-generated characters were well-done. The make-up and costumes were incredible. The attention to detail, from the tearing, and loosening of Alice's clothing, all the way to the fine details of the fur on the rabbits, dogs, mice, and horses were excellent for the year this film was produced. The background music was great throughout, and they really did a great job with the sound effects. In the final battle scene between Alice and the Jabberwocky, Alice cuts off its head, killing it with the vorpal sword. As the head rolls down the stairs of the crumbled tower, you can hear a squish- squish. The subtle use of the squish sound effect really added to the scene. <br/><br/>This character focused film is an epic new twist on an old classic!"

A fantasy movie mixed with adventurous yet adds Action to it, directed by Tim Burton and scenario written by Linda Woolverton. <br/><br/>Briefly, this movie was about a nineteen year-old girl named Alice Kingsley (starring Mia Wasikowska) who comes back to a magical world called Underland, a place where she visited 13 years ago. She was told by her Wonderland ""friends"" that she is the only one who can get back She was told by her Wonderland ""friends"" that she is the only one who can get back the White Queen's throne (starring Anne Hathaway) and who can fight the Jabberwocky, A wild dragon-like creature owned by the worst, unmerciful, scariest Red Queen, White Queen's older sister (starring Helena Bonham Carter). By the help and support of her Wonderland friends, especially the Mad Hatter (starring Johnny Depp), could she ever win back the Justice that was taken years ago that she thought might only be a dream? <br/><br/>Based on my personal opinion, this movie is for people age 13 and above. Most of the creatures in Wonderland might seem creepy and hideous to some people. Most of the scene in this movie is very sadistic to some people who don't like Action genre movie. One of the creepiest scene is when Dormouse took Bandersnatch's eyeball. It might sound so heartless to lots of people. Overall, I personally think this movie is relatable for those who have that imagination of them that is outside the box."

","Return of Alice to Wonderland directed by Tim Burton.

The story is basically Alice revisiting, step by step, what she had already done, only the end differs and not for the better. The actress Mia Wasikowska is a very insipid Alice and the rest of the performances are only generic. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter try, but they cannot raise the movie above average.

","Splendid, lushly and somehow reminding the distinguished old-school fantasy fiction of the 30th. That is, considering only visual effects. Yes, it is a feast for the eye. If only there were nothing more except Cheshire's smile (which awkwardly, but plausibly transform into the Moon), I'd already said it's a very beautiful movie. And here's also the Bandersnatch, both creepy and fascinating. And a mad tea-party in some stale, fusty marsh near the most picturesque ruins of a mill. The Knave and Horsey, so appreciative in the sunset. <br/><br/>The only issue is... the sheer weakness of the plot, as plain as an eggsie: we have Alice arriving in the Wonderland, whose inhabitants she must help. Well, guess what was at the end. But if you think soberly - the best thing not to keep in your head when seeing 'Alice' is that you watch a Tim Burton film. It is not him, really: it is a Robert Stromberg film at most. He did his best, there's naught to grudge 'im with. The ones responsible for poor, pathetic dialogue, foolish pseudo-climax (the White Queen, oh, so good! The Red, oh, so nasty!) -- er, well, as I said, the ones responsible for that are the script-writers. (Who are they, btw?.. I highly doubt the history has kept their names for general).<br/><br/>Is the film worth watching? Yes - 'cause it's an attraction. A matinée, as it were. (Haven't seen it in 3D, but no doubt the thing's good). If you think of 'Alice' as a movie (i.e., complicated characters, plot and so on), you are mistaken. That's just a 'toon for very little kids.

","Alice in Wonderland is a tale most of us know from child hood, but in the 2010 live action retelling we meet some very different characters. Alice as played by Mia Wasikowska and The Mad Hatter played by Johnny Depp having a curious meeting in Underland. A land Alice falls into through a rabbit hole as she is running away from the stresses of her life. We follow them through this strange new land as they attempt to bring down the Red Queen played by Helena Bonham Carter. The inhabitants of Underland want the White Queen, Anne Hathaway, to recapture her crown and bring peace back to the world. To do so Alice must defeat a great beast, the jabberwocky that is favored by the Red Queen. This quest brings out the bravery that Alice must possess to kill the jabberwocky and help the White Queen recapture her crown. Through Alices heroic journey through a land that she believes must be a dream she meets characters that help her realize her true potential. The White Queen gives her a suit of armor that will protect her against the jabberwocky and ultimately gives her the inner strength to believe in herself. Disney movies are notorious for always having a theme of inner strength and belief in yourself. This film relies heavily on special effects and optics to create the scenes we see in Underland. This also shows the point of view in the movie as a director interpretive. Many of the shots are up close and personal with the characters creating the sense that we are not only watching Alice's adventure from the outside but we are actually in Underland with her. Coloring and lighting are another big part of the movie and how we view it. There are many colors that show advancing color: bringing them more into the forefront of the scene drawing our eyes to it. The makeup of the Red Queen and her followers is bright, making their over-accentuated features stand out even more. The Mad Hatters hair is also a very bright red to over-exaggerate his already over the top personality. The director's use of color, lighting, and the director's interpretive point of view we are able to walk with Alice. We see her grow and come to the realization that in the end, she was always the right Alice. She is able to overcome her fears and return to her real life dilemmas. Alice goes to Underland as a scared young girl but comes back an independent, strong woman who is ready to take on anything that comes her way."

However, it is completely lacking in any heart from previous films, such as the animated Disney classic, it is very dark and at times quite frightening for a younger audience, which is meant to be their target. As well as that, the plot is all over the place, it tries too hard to fit all these characters and different themes in to one ninety minute movie that it all feels too overwhelming and difficult to keep up. While the animation and effects are outstanding, nothing else about Alice in Wonderland is, definitely better off avoiding this one. <br/><br/>A young girl named Alice is transported to Wonderland, where she must triumph over the Red Queen. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Johnny Depp"

Now a teenager being prepared for an arranged marriage, Alice returns to the ominous Wonderland where the Red Queen is gaining power. Another visual triumph by Tim Burton who previously made such visual wonders as Sleepy Hollow and Ed Wood. Mia Wasikowska plays Alice who still remembers the rabbit, cat and the intriguing Mad Hatter who is played with crazed force by Johnny Depp. Wasikowska is one of the best actresses to portray Alice and she pulls it off with complete bewilderment. Depp has long been a prize element of Burton films. Although his Hatter is amusing I am reminded that this character was never given this much screen time. Only Depp could ensue this and it plays like false heroism in the conclusion. Helena Bonham Carter is hilarious as the evil Red Queen despite some standard plotting involving her attempt to take over. Anne Hathaway plays the White Queen whom prepares Alice for her duel with the feared Jabberwocky. Crispin Glover plays the knave of hearts who is the Red Queen's arrogant henchman and follows her every order. The special effects are glorious presenting a gloom yet somewhat inviting Wonderland filled with strange images.

","Alice in Wonderland is a take on the classic book and animated movie. This film brings all the famous characters to life. The main character, Alice has been having a reoccurring dream since a little girl. One day, she is at a party and is drawn to a rabbit hole that she falls down in. After her fall into Wonderland, Alice learns that she is there to help sleigh the Jabberwocky and end the Red Queens reign. To do this, she will need help from her new friends The Mad Hatter, Nivens McTwisp the white rabbit, The White Queen, a cat named Cheshire, a mouse, and Absalom the caterpillar.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland has a coming of age theme. Alice is a child in the beginning then we flash forward to her at the age of 20 and on the brink of getting engaged. Alice goes through many bodily changes on her journey from regular sized, small, tall, small, smaller, taller, and smaller. This reoccurs thorough the entirety of the film and the major changes of Alice. Alice is also not sure who she really is or what she is doing in this strange place she finds herself in. She is told she is ""The Alice"" there to slay the Jabberwocky, but she does not accept this fate at first and must be convinced. When she arrives, it is argued over whether or not she is the right Alice. This is symbolic of Alice trying to discover who she really is and making her own identity at this time.<br/><br/>Another underlying theme of Alice in Wonderland, which we see through a motif is death. Death is seen in many forms in this film. Repeatedly, it is associated with the Red Queen though when she says ""off with their head"". Alice, at first believes she is in just a dream, but she quickly realizes that it is not. She has her first brush with death when she is attacked by the Bandersnatch, The Red Queen's beast Alice is again facing death when she has her final fight with the Jabberwocky. Absalom also represents the theme of death when he goes into the final stage of transforming from a caterpillar to a butterfly, and he says ""I have come to the end of this life"". In a way, this ties in with the coming of age theme as well. As one comes of age and grows up they are leaving behind their younger self.<br/><br/>Wonderland gets brought to life through the use of special effects. This technique enhances our feeling of being there and bringing the cartoon version to life. All of the magical talking creatures you believe are actually in front of Alice talking to her.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland creates a spectacular vision of a classic story. Alice is a girl who is growing up and coming of age. This is no easy task for anyone, and for her it is even a life or death situation. Her dreamland and what she is there to do is reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz in a way. A young girl is placed in a magical world filled with strange creatures on an adventurous journey."
"Xianghong","7","0","0","2 February 2015"," Tim Burton might have jumped the Jabberwocky on this one.
","It was lauded as the perfect marriage of director and subject matter. The eighth collaboration between director Tim ""King of Emo Goth"" Burton and the perpetually offbeat Johnny Depp - I could have sworn those two are twins separated from birth - for a movie adaptation based on Lewis Carroll's wonderfully nonsensical novels. What could possibly go wrong?<br/><br/>The answer, in a nutshell, is Disney. I don't blame them for following a tried and tested formula but come on, not every movie has to simulate a theme park ride to be commercially successful! If you were expecting a dark, twisted flick Ã  la the decade old video game American McGee's Alice (which was scheduled for the big screen starring Sarah Michelle Gellar but cancelled, unfortunately) then you're in for a major disappointment. It comes as no surprise, then, that Tim Burton is under flak for selling out.<br/><br/>In this version of Alice, our waifish protagonist (borderline anorexic Mia Wasikowska) returns to the now desolate Underland where her former companions question her identity and she her own sanity. She is attacked by strange creatures in passable action sequences and stumbles around aimlessly before being guided by the Cheshire Cat to the Mad Hatter (Johhny Depp chanelling Willy Wonka/Jack Sparrow). The first meeting between Alice and Mad Hatter is possibly the best scene in the entire film, featuring a depressing Burton- esque set mocking the gaiety of the original tea party. Coupled with a deliciously whimsical performance by Johnny Depp, we catch a glimpse of what the movie should have been.<br/><br/>We are treated to more filler escapades before Alice is brought to the White Queen (Anne Hathaway acting really creepy), who tasks her to defeat the fearsome Jabberwocky, champion of the evil Red Queen (delightfully off kilter Helena Bonham Carter). Helena effortlessly steals every scene she appears in with her hilarious insecurity. After much griping by Alice, the two sides eventually meet on the battlefield to duke it out in a suitably climatic finish. I won't spoil the ending for you but it ends extremely predictably anyway. Hint: the good guys always win the day.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's Wonderland is undeniably visually lavish but the entire film simply feels hollow, like the director was simply marking off his usual checklist. Gnarled trees? Check. Gothic makeup? Check. Johnny Depp? Check. That reminds me - thanks for the paycheck. Next movie please! The use of 3D felt forced and gimmicky; something tacked on in an attempt to imitate Avatar's success. The end result resembles a really pretty children's picture book that is also utterly forgettable at the same time.<br/><br/>Halfway through the show, I started asking myself: what's the point of making this movie if you have nothing new to say? The magic behind Carroll's classics was the ingenuity in the way it stirred the reader's imagination but Burton's wonderland literally leaves nothing to the imagination, preferring to continuously bombard us with flashy images instead. Kids will probably have a Frabbulous time (it IS a Disney movie after all) but really, there's nothing much for grown ups.<br/><br/>Goodness, I do believe Tim Burton might have jumped the Jabberwocky on this one."

","Alice in Wonderland is an extremely beloved book by Lewis Carroll, that was adapted into a Disney animated classic. But how does the re-imagining fare out? <br/><br/>Well the story I feel wasn't half bad, and I feel judging this film too deeply will be a headache because it is suppose to be filled with many bizarre characters and unexplainable moments. For the most part the lunacy is highly enjoyable, but as far as the situation goes which is being presented as serious in subject matter is nothing that special. In a nutshell, it's good vs. evil and a tad boring at that. There are parts where Mia Wasikowska shines as Alice, but there are more moments where the character is undeniably dull. I have always enjoyed Miss Wasikowska's performances, and had she more polished moments in the film I believe the performance would have been solid.<br/><br/>Speaking of characters, Johnny Depp again delivers with his eccentric portrayal of the Mad Hatter. Helena Bonham Carter is also very well developed as the Red Queen, and my top 3 favourite characters would have to be The Hatter, The Caterpillar and The Cheshire Cat (Voiced by the always fantastic Stephen Fry).<br/><br/>Well for as much bashing as this movie has taken, the visuals were incredible. It's becoming harder to say if technology is keeping up with Burton, but I loved every speck of smoke whiffling on the screen. Creating a live action version of Wonderland I feel could give ""Avatar"" (2009) a run for it's money. If I had any complaints it's that the story could have been better, and if they had emphasised the correct characters the movie would be a lot more enjoyable. The fact that Christopher Lee was not more involved in the project is a little disappointing, given how his character is discussed throughout the story. They literally cut off his characters tongue at that moment, so he would not be able to talk during the rest of the scene.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: When all is said and done, a return to Wonderland was inevitable and having Tim Burton direct it was the correct way to go. The result is a smart decision that if it had been executed a little better, it would have found more success critically. Regardless, it has fantastic casting, and that alone would get me back in the chair to watch it again. 5/10. Hats off to the future!"

","Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is an independent-minded 19 year old girl. She is being pushed to engage the horrible lord Hamish. Her family has fallen on hard times after the death of her father. With Hamish on bended knee in front of everybody, she runs away following the White Rabbit. She falls down a hole into a world called Underland which resembles her one dream which she's had ever since she was a little girl. She meets the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and many other fanciful characters.<br/><br/>This is Tim Burton's visual style through and through. He gives an unique look to the already wonderful Wonderland. The characters are all too familiar. Mia Wasikowska is a perfectly lovely actress. I do wish her character has a bit more fun. That could be said of the movie itself. Both Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are suitably weird. However Anne Hathaway is way too weird and it doesn't fit her. Matt Lucas is fun as Tweedledee and Tweedledum. I am not in love with the story especially the third act. It tries to take it to a more serious real place. I like this more for the crazy visual style than anything else."

","OK, but not great. Story was very linear and conventional. I was expecting over-the-top zaniness, but it didn't really happen. The first half was good, but once the novelty of 3D wore off, I got bored.<br/><br/>If ever Tim Burton had a licence to make a weird insane movie, it is here, but he seemed to hold back. It's as if he expected that the visual effects would be enough to carry the movie, but they aren't.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the visual effects are good, but CGI should never be the making of a movie (James Cameron, take note). Even then, the CGI and 3D here are not brilliant and contain a few flaws (as an example, look at any moving shot of Stayne / Crispin Glover, especially on a horse).<br/><br/>In keeping with his director, Johnny Depp seemed oddly restrained. His performance was mediocre-to-flat. Mia Wasikowska has the most screen time, obviously, and does OK, especially for someone so young and inexperienced.<br/><br/>Not bad, but definitely not a must-see.

","Alice in wonderland, the delightfully cute tale about a girl going to a magical world that has many macabre twist and turns. So what better director to revive this tale in a new light than the man who is known for his dark cartoony style: Tim Burton. That's what I thought at last till I saw the movie, I was very disappointed. First off I might as well mention some of the positives before I rip it to shreds. The overall look is great; even if the CGI isn't great per say, the dark and disturbed atmosphere gives it something to look at and latch onto. The performances by Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are fun, their wacky crazy actions are enjoyable. That's about it. What I tend to hate about this film and another film by Tim Burton planet of the apes remake; ironically, is that the climax are the same and are forced. The same old one side fighting against the other side. Even if it's required, I still don't like it. The main actress; her name doesn't come to mind, is so bland that I could care less about what happens to her or what she does. Like how I mentioned the cool effects, it's also to the film's detriment. It really relies too much on its effects and not on character. There isn't much left to talk about because it's so one note: Alice is back and she has to save the day, there's noting else in there that makes it worth my time or anyone else's."

","As always with Tim Burton, the visual effects were amazing!! Loved the intense colours and the look of the characters! However, the plot seemed too simple and the attempts at creating suspense weren't quite successful, perhaps because of the prediction that Alice would defeat the Jabberwocky. I also didn't get the whole mistaken identity thing and how there could possibly be another Alice; it didn't seem to serve any purpose. And it didn't seem very plausible that the Red Queen and her chief lieutenant could take so long to recognise her, given that they were supposed to be on the hunt for her. I haven't read Lewis Carroll's book before, but I have a feeling that the movie doesn't do justice to it."
"trisp","6","0","0","12 September 2012"," Not bad but could have been so much better.
","I was really revved up about seeing this movie. The trailers and the designs had me pumped. When I left the theater, my feeling was that while it was pretty decent, it felt underwhelming. Burton seemed like an ideal director for this oft-filmed tale and yet it lacks magic or wonder. In all fairness to Burton, however, it's more the fault of the script-writer Linda Woolverton. It isn't a horrible script mind you. But it tries too hard to give more fantasy archetypes to a story that didn't really need any. For example, the caterpillar becomes the wise sage, and the Hatter is the loner who connects with the hero (think Aragorn). Also, when she throws in little nods to the books, it comes off as insecure as if to say ""OK. There see? I haven't messed this story up."" I liked Depp's Hatter in the first scene but after a while he devolved into more of the bland Disney prince with a few eccentricities here and there. Waszikoska (sp?) is not a very interesting Alice, but again the problem seems to lie more in the script than the performance.<br/><br/>So what did I like about it? The CGI characters look really cool owing quite a lot to Tenniel's original drawings with a very, very subtle Burtonesque edge. In fact the CGI creations are the real scene stealers. The backgrounds are lovely to look at but I think Burton's real sets work better because they add an extra level of magic and awe (like his stop-motion sets). I might be one of the few that did like Hathaway as the White Queen. Say what you will about her performance, but it was just so over-the-top that it was one of the highlights of the movie. <br/><br/>So all in all, this is a pretty hit-and-miss film. The dialog is pretty mediocre and some of the action scenes feel un-actiony. But on the other hand it is nice to look at and a good chunk of the actors try to work with what little material they have. If you want a really good version of the story, then I suggest either reading the books or watching the original Disney cartoon."

","For over a century people have been saying that the Carroll's literary masterpiece was in dire need of a ""chosen-one, destined to fulfill a prophecy"" storyline. Burton has turned Alice, Wonderland, The Mad Hatter etc. into a paint-by-numbers fantasy adventure along the lines of Harry Potter. It's messy and degrading. The Mad Hatter is a hatter and he is mad, but when you spend that kind of money on Depp, you should also have the Hatter well trained in swordplay. That way, he can be there in the final battle. Characters limp around without much to do, but at least the actors make them enjoyable. The film is entertaining, but could have been impressive with a little downtime. For years now, films have gradually been cutting the ""slower"" moments from films, not realising that these instances add weight to the action. The film flew by and I barely remember anything. It was a beautiful, but also nauseating, film. As for the ""futterwhack""? Never before has any scene been so out of place, forced, pointless, and idiotically confusing. Tim Burton's worst film."

Although there was a moment or two when all I saw was Willy Wonka on (more) crack. Helena Bonham Carter was a great Red Queen and Crispin Glover was wonderful as the Knave. I never cared much for the Caterpillar but Alan Rickman made it perfect. Overall the movie was very good. It didn't drag, there weren't any awful lines, it just didn't have everything I expected.

","This was in the simplest terms, horrible. When you watch an Alice movie you'd expect to know nothing at all about what you're going to watch. Instead in the first quarter of the movie you are told everything you will see and in what order. That is not what in Alice in Wonderland movie should be like. What many of said before me, if Tim Burton were to have based it off of Through the Looking-Glass it could've been great. She would've started off walking through the mirror and having a crazy adventure where each step was a new turn. He could have even just made a remake of the first Disney one which was mostly Alice's Adventure's in Wonderland with a tiny bit of the Looking-Glass thrown in. Instead he followed the same plot of every kid fantasy movie that has come out in the last seven years. If you were hoping for an Alice movie comparable at all to the books or even the first Disney movie be prepared to be highly disappointed. The whole purpose of me writing this review is to lower the score of this film on IMDb and hopefully help everyone who was in this movie to take a look at all the horrible comments written on here and realize they messed up horribly and apologize to everyone whose ever read the book or seen the movie and had their imaginations broadened.

Oh yeah the plot.No one seemed to have been curious about that unimportant detail called the script.<br/><br/>Uhh..hmm..you know Alice is now 19 and by virtue of it she seems to have a perennially confused, wooden look on her face.

The wide eyed child's splendor that comes from the Lewis Carroll's characters? Here, as flimsy as 2D cardboard cutouts. Your wonderland looks drop dead gorgeous of course. But nothing that one cant experience from a modern day video game. Mia Wasikowska seems utterly lost and too inexperienced to fit into Alice's miniature shoes. Anne Hathway's White Queen comes across looking slightly cuckoo and dumb. The Red Queen is nothing you haven't seen Helena Bonham Carter do before. Johhny Depp's character is so poorly written that I expected him to evaporate off the screen midway instead of the Cheshire cat. The set design and imagery gets all the detail right. But trippy? Not by a mile. Picturesque? Yes. Magical? No.<br/><br/>A shoddily written fantasy soup, lukewarm and bread crumbs gone soggy.

","This Legendary Filmmaker has made remarkable films in the past, to name One or Two would be injustice, he's made great films throughout his career.

Unfortunately, this ranks amongst Burton's weakest effort to date. <br/><br/>'Alice In Wonderland' is boring, it lacks the pace. Plus, why making this a 3-D flick, it would've been much more better minus that. The film has an boring start, an okay middle & an ordinary end. The cult cartoon doesn't get it's due here. It's shocking to know that a guy like Tim Burton made such ordinary stuff. His body of work has got a lot of gold medals, but 'Alice In Wonderland' is no-where a gold-medal type effort. <br/><br/>The Graphics are good, but now we're tired of appreciating Graphics again and again. 'Avatar' had a the best of visuals and script. This one lacks a solid script, which is it's biggest flaw. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Johnny Depp delivers a dynamic performance. He gives The Mad Hatter a different style altogether. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as the Red Queen. Mila as Alice does a fair job.

If i'm going to spend that extra money i want to see a noticeable difference in quality which was severely lacking from this showing. Definitely didn't have the impact Avatar had on me.

"Citizen_Cam","5","3","8","9 March 2010"," Incoherent and incomprehensible
","Tim Burton is one of those directors who believes that ""weird"" is the same as ""good."" I ask more from a movie than visual impressiveness and fantastic creatures and settings. I ask for coherent story lines, well-crafted characters and good acting performances. And sadly Burton's latest offering fails to deliver these last three, concentrating instead on the first two almost exclusively.<br/><br/>Okay, the source material itself is not famous for making sense. Indeed, much of the charm of Lewis Carroll's original stories is their creative use of nonsense, such as the poem Jabberwocky and the various puzzles of illogic. So to expect a movie based on this material to be coherent is, you might think, asking too much. And you might be right, but my feeling is that even trying is completely missing the point. Burton revealed in an interview recently that the challenge for he and his team was to find a way of linking together Carroll's works to create a coherent story - in his words, the original was more of a ""series of unrelated events"". Which is precisely the point - the original stories DON'T make any sense, and that's exactly what Carroll intended. So why bother? If you said to me ""Alice in Wonderland can't be turned into a good film without a major rewrite to the story"", I would say ""Then don't make it. Make something else."" But Burton very unwisely ignored any advice of that kind and pressed on regardless. Which would be fine, if he'd actually managed to link the story elements together with any kind of coherency. Sadly, he has not.<br/><br/>The film's ""plot"" is flimsy and has little internal story logic. Even a story set in a fantasy land needs to have basic internal logic. Instead, Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton have attempted to create a brand new story using Carroll's characters but have failed to explain precisely why any of this is happening. Alice returns to Wonderland after more than a decade but doesn't remember her first visit, and no explanation is offered as to why she doesn't remember or what that previous visit meant. There is simply no reason for this element to exist - it adds nothing to the story. It's not excusable because it's an entirely new creation and nothing to do with Carroll's work. Once in Wonderland she encounters the Mad Hatter and helps him deal with the Red Queen by slaying the Jabberwocky to restore the White Queen to power. But no explanation is ever given for precisely WHY she needs to do this. It's almost as if Burton expects everybody to have a copy of the original book with them so they can use it to decipher cryptic plot elements. A movie's story must stand up on its own - if you have to do background reading to understand it, the writer has failed.<br/><br/>Most of the characters seem to be there simply because you expect them to be. They add very little whatsoever to the story; indeed, you could cut most of them out with no major impact on the story. An example is the Cheshire Cat, who literally does nothing but make a couple of cryptically smart-arse remarks. Again, I understand that this is also his role in the book, but Burton isn't making the book - the book's already been written. If you're going to have a story, characters need to contribute in some way to the story. The Hatter's role is expanded and the writer has tried to turn him into some sort of sympathetic character, but no explanation for his actions is ever given. He's simply there. Alice could, one thinks, have saved the day without any of these characters being present. And as to exactly WHY she should save the day...it's never explored.<br/><br/>The writing isn't the only weak point. Burton has hired a cast of actors who are very talented and coaxed them into over-the-top, unsubtle performances. I appreciate the source material requires a certain amount of this, as the characters are supposed to be larger-than-life. But there is a difference between larger-than-life and over-the-top. Bonham-Carter and Depp are the worst offenders - Bonham-Carter's Red Queen is so overtly overdone that it's almost painful to watch. Depp's Hatter is simply weird. Again, I realise this is the point, but it would have been a greater challenge to interpret the character in a different way than chewing the scenery and being generally strange.<br/><br/>The movie does have its good points. Visually it's impressive, but that is what you expect from Burton so it's hardly worth mentioning. Burton's Wonderland is one of vivid colours contrasted with post-apocalyptic scenery, and it does look incredible. I only saw the 2D version but I do have to wonder what 3D would possibly add to the experience. Burton's use of CGI has always been innovative, and certain elements such as the Queen's card warriors and the landscape work very well. But the appearance of a movie is, for me, always secondary to its story and characters, and the effects aren't enough to hold my interest.<br/><br/>Readers of the above might think I hated the movie – that's perhaps a strong word. There was a lot of potential in using modern-day technology to do justice to Carroll's story. It could have been the Lord of the Rings of Lewis Carroll. Instead, it is a film that feels like it was written in half an hour. It should never have been made. It did not need to be made. The story has already been told, and Burton's version adds nothing to the story; in trying to add a story, Burton has completely missed the point of the source material and created, instead of a re-telling or an adaptation, an egomaniacal, self-indulgent acid trip. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to pull out my copy of Batman Returns and remember a day when you used to be cool."

"Astralan","6","3","8","7 March 2010"," Usual Tim Burton, but even that gets old eventually
","First off, I was perplexed at the onset of this film as to why Burton decided to use the expensive 3D architecture to produce this film. Honestly, it could have worked fine in 2D seeing very little of the film took advantage of the technology. Most film by Burton can be classified dark, but with a bit of jocularity that keeps the film entertaining. I was disappointed that there really wasn't much levity in this film. The overall fingerprint of the plot was war: Why does one got to war? To what ends will it inevitably bring? A crown? Loyal subjects? Money? Power? Okay, one queen had secret weapons, and the other queen is waiting for their savior. Wonder who is coming to dinner? Burton arranges for his favorite players once again, but there are some fresh faces as well, such as the relatively unknown Mia Wasikowska - who by the way, plays an excellent older Alice. Depp is given his freedom to develop his cast character even to the initial painting he did of the character he played. Helena plays a wonderful queen, but her cheek is not all that unfamiliar when comparing it to her role in the Potter films. I felt even though the cast played on favorites, they worked well in this stylized edition of Lewis Carrol's books. Technically, as I already mentioned, this film could have been done with a lot less money had Burton omitted the 3D cameras. Putting on the glasses after having been completely immersed in Camerons beautiful Pandoran environment just didn't satisfy the desire to have a presentation of something new. Being one of the first CGI films that Burton has produces (Being a staunch supporter of stop-action camera techniques over computer generated animation), he wasted no time extrapolating and exaggerating his cast characters into solid cartoon format. The color is dark, the shading is deep and rich; but I just don't know if it is enough to keep people coming back after the DVD is released to watch it more that a couple more times before it ends up on CraigsList. I'm sad to say I would be fine watching this on my home theater had I the option of paying $10 to see a matinée which included a $3 disposable 3D glass charge (I am slowly obtaining an impressive collection of fat, black plastic 3D movie glasses). It was fun, but it just wasn't quite ""There"". Don't get me wrong... I like Burton's work and haven't really missed anything he's directed big or small.

When Alice fell down the rabbit hole with apparently (or so she acted it) no recollection of her adventures as a little girl, she greeted Wonderland with no interest and, at some points, with a bit of hostility.<br/><br/>As far as the characters are concerned, some I was impressed with (the Cheshire Cat,the March Hair, the White Queen) and satisfied with, and other just didn't do it for me. Alice, the Mad Hatter, the caterpillar(saved a little by Alan Rickman) and the Dormouse were so-so, half-assed and overall just a mess. I think whatever Depp was trying to do with the Mad Hatter either only looked good on paper, so to speak, or so subtle it was missed by even the keenest eye. Also, the dance was completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>The dialogue was choppy and was, I think, best described as ""clumsy"". A lot of it seemed like just filler, tried really hard to be funny AND kid friendly (always a tough thing to do), and was a lot of the time just poorly delivered. I still have no idea why a raven is like a writing desk but after it was asked so many times, I just stopped caring and started getting annoyed. A neat idea for a verbal theme, but it just wasn't charming enough I suppose.<br/><br/>With just enough star power and a familiar title, this movie will probably make bank, and not all of that money will be undeserving. It had it's ups, but the cons just outweighed the pros this time. I think Burton could've made this movie a lot more engaging and personal if he had more free rein over it. It seems like Disney had him on a pretty short leash and he just kind of gave up.<br/><br/>Because I am a die hard Burton and Wonderland fan, I just can't bring myself to just flat out call it a bad movie. I saw it with low expectations and was STILL disappointed. I mean, I really wanted to like this movie. But it just didn't have enough...enough....well, just not enough quite frankly.<br/><br/>You'll get 'em next time, right Tim? P.S. No doorknob? Really?"
"cameron-679-209278","5","3","8","7 March 2010"," Alice in Wonderland not so wonderful
","It was 1:30 pm on a Friday afternoon and the IMAX theater as packed. I sat anxiously to see the new Alice in Wonderland, as I am a big Johnny Depp fan, and an even bigger Tim Burton fan. Finally the film begins and I sit back to enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland is not the conventional story that we all know and have seen before. Instead Alice is much older and can not remember anything about wonderland except in constant nightmares that she has. While at a party a Lord proposes to her and she runs off only to fall down the rabbit hole once again. This time however wonderland is not so wonderful. The red queen( Helena Bonham Carter) has rule over the people and she is a very nasty person. Right away I was disappointed in the look of ""underworld"". The colors weren't vibrant, the landscape was not too imaginative, and the CGI was pretty poorly done. I will skip ahead in the movie a bit to when Alice meets The Mad Hatter(Johnny Depp). His character is absolutely demented in a very frightening way. Sometimes when he talks his voice changes pitch and he begins speaking like the devil almost. He is no longer happy but very depressed and only goes on about killing the Red Queen.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Red Queen when I first saw her Knave of Hearts Stayne I kept saying to myself ""who is that he looks very familiar"". It took awhile but during the scene where Stayne tries to molest Alice suddenly a light bulb in my head went off and I then said to myself ""Holy crap thats George McFly!"". Back to the future being one of my favorite movies, I couldn't take the Knave of Hearts as a bad ass he was suppose to be considering the actor played the ultimate wimp GEORGE FREAKING MCFLY! Wait what? Did I just say there was attempted molestation? Yep. Just to give you an idea of how grim this movie is, when Alice goes to meet the Red Queen she must cross a fetid moat filled with human heads, and since Alice is small at the time she has to jump on the heads to cross the moat. This isn't the cartoon Alice everyone knows.<br/><br/>Lovable characters like Cheshire Cat, the Tweedles, and even the Caterpillar Absolem are all very bland and no one stands out. I guess I liked Cheshire cat, but who doesn't like a cat that can float? Tweedledee and Tweedledum were just annoying. I liked how their faces looked, I got a chuckle out of that, but the acting done by Matt Lucas was pretty horrible. The Caterpillar Absolem is still puffing on his hookah. He somehow lost the ability to spell out stuff with the smoke like he did in the cartoon, which would have been an nice 3D effect.<br/><br/>Oh hey 3D I almost forgot to talk about that. Tim Burton when shooting for Alice in Wonderland opted to shoot using a regular 2D camera and then digitally convert the movie into 3D. Bad choice sir. There were several instances where things just did not look right at all. For instance right in the beginning I picked up on a tree that was 3D at the bottom but once it got to the top it went back to being 2D again, and was painfully obvious I have no Idea how it made it through post production. There were several gimmicky 3D moments which I absolutely hate. I think that the technology should be used for immersion into the movie, not some bug flying out of the screen where it had no purpose of even fitting in the movie. There were some cool 3D moments though I won't completely deny that. But they were so few and far between. Just to sort of give some kind of idea of the 3D effects, they were on par with the effect of the anaglyph red/cyan glasses, minus the blurring. Maybe Avatar spoiled me with what 3D can be, and I am being overly critical on Alice, but I don't think so. This movie did not feel polished and it did not have the typical character of what I come to expect from Tim Burton.<br/><br/>I will leave on a good note. The second half of the movie is actually really good, and the ending is spectacular. I finally started to feel the magic of ""underworld"". There were some very funny moments with The Mad Hatter and his crew. Mia Wasikowska also did an amazing job playing Alice."
"cultfilmfan","5","3","8","7 March 2010"," Alice In Wonderland
","Alice In Wonderland is based upon the books Alice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll. I am sure most people have seen the animated 1951 Walt Disney version of Alice In Wonderland and this new version is more or less a follow up to that film with one of the main differences being that it is not animated. This new version is in live action and when you go to the theatre to see it, they will be giving you a pair of those plastic glasses to see the film in 3-D. As a child, I do not remember how many times I saw the 1951 version of Alice In Wonderland, but it was always one of my favourite Walt Disney movies at that time. What, I liked so much about the original 1951 version was it's beautiful colours and unique characters and it was full of fun, mystery and a world of enchantment that really fascinated me and made me love watching this new world coming undone before my eyes. There was also a great deal of humour in it and it was a very entertaining and fun film to watch. Unfortunately, I can not say the same thing about this new 2010 version. A lot of the magic of the original film had disappeared for me and seeing this new version, made me wish I was watching the original animated one instead. While in the original everything in the world of Wonderland is bright, colourful and full of life, this new Wonderland is bland, dirty and not all that appealing. The light hearted touches such as some of the humour of the first film are mostly gone here. The acting here also I found to be bland from some performances and really almost one note performances, while other actors went so over the top for the roles with their acting style, that it became almost annoying and instead of being fascinating, or thrilling, it left me feeling bored. The costumes and the makeup of the film's characters all look okay to a point, but again a little too flashy for my likes, which did not fit the drab and boring backdrops that they used. The story also just did not captivate me. When, Alice is in her own world in reality, I found it to be uninteresting and quite boring and when she went to Wonderland, I found it over the top, annoying at times and not all that interesting really. I also had some problems with the film's script because it all felt a tad rushed. Then again I was glad to get out of the theatre when I did and if it had been much longer it probably would have given me more reason to complain. What, I was hoping for in this new version was another bright and beautiful world from a young girl's imagination with surprises and treats along the way to fascinate us and keep us in our own state of wonder. Instead, I found a dull and boring film that also relies heavy on technical effects, rather than story, making it another case of style over substance. Other people in the audience seemed to really like the film, so I am sure there is an audience for it, but it just was not personally for my taste at all."

","I won't necessarily say this movie was horrible. I had too many high hopes prior to release to say anything close to that. At best the movie was visually stunning, captivating, and a treat for those who wanted a Zelda-esk, Final Fantasy feel. At worst this film was clichéd, predictable, Cheesy, and just plain ""Over Disneyfied"".<br/><br/>The score was magnificent. Danny Elfman did a fantastic job at recreating musically the ebbs and flows of the film, but SADLY for the first time Tim Burton Disappointed me.<br/><br/>Visually, other than a stunning film, there are parts of the world of Wonderland that bothered me. I didn't care if they called the place ""Underland"", ""Wonderland"", or ""Crap"". The entire place seemed more like a theme park ride promoting a Nintendo Game, rather than the creepy, sometimes extremely confusing, and daunting, zoomed in world that we remember. Now don't get me wrong. It would be impossible to make Wonderland look anything like the 1950's cartoon world, but they could have at least shot for some of that insanity. Instead the setting was too wide, and all the quirks that is wonderland became lost within the massive ever expanding Lord of the Rings type vistas and landscapes. Stunningly beautiful, but pointless and unnecessary in my opinion. There was a definite ""unreal-ism"" that seemed to be missing. If I wanted to go to Yellowstone National Park, I would.<br/><br/>Actors are only as good as the script they are given, which is true for any movie, including this one. Carter (red queen) and Depp (mad hatter) portrayed their characters wonderfully, but some of the lines they were given were just CHEESY and AWFUL. Depp did seem to be over-channeling Jack Sparrow at times. I'm not going to sugar coat it, I thought I was watching a movie on SCi-Fi/Disney channel collaboration there for a while there. Everybody from Alice's ""real world"" of London did brilliantly in my opinion, but as soon as she fell down the rabbit hole the dialogue became skewed and left a foul taste in my mouth after a while. None of the Characters were portrayed the way they were supposed to be portrayed. The Flowers talked in only one scene, and they were all grouped together with the other characters of Wonderland. Tweedledee and Tweedledum were brilliant, but not the creepy shifty eyed characters from the original film, just fat and childish. The Cheshire Cat irritated me the most; too smart and professor-like. Where was the oddball nonsense from the original, almost purposely confusing Alice? The Characters seemed out of place, almost always shown in groups, with disneyfied Dialogue. Smiling then frowning then Smiling again, hugs, in your face emotions, BARF. Mia (Alice) was brilliant at the part, but a bit dull and clueless at her lines at times.<br/><br/>The Plot was descent, but not good. The Helms Deep style fight sequences and over dramatization of Champions, and Swords, and Destiny's made me yawn and want to go watch Lord of the Rings again. the story was over-simplified and clearly thrown together clumsily. There is little to no character development, and the film is shot with one too many one liners. I thought I was watching several ""Alice in Wonderland"" commercials just strung together in sequence. Shame on you Tim Burton! Now why I don't just give this film a complete 2 or 3 score is this: THIS MOVIE WAS BEAUTIFUL. Not Alice in Wonderland beautiful, but beautiful in a Final Fantasy/Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter kind of way. Some, and I mean SOME of the dialogue sequences weren't horrible, and some, again emphasis on SOME, of the plot was fairly good. But overall . . . . I would wait for this one to come out of DVD."
"mamoon66","10","4","13","7 March 2010"," Alice in Tim's Wonderland.......the real title
","I am writing this review for the soul purpose of explaining who and what Tim Burton is...i do not see how any one could say that "" Tim Burton did not meet expectation"" or ""Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are losing the touch"" or ""the movie was only animation""... i am sorry but as a media literate person,this movie had a deep meaning and it should not be compared to Alice in Wonderland the original Walt Disney production.This was Tim Burton's perspective of what the world of Alice looks like. Tim Burton is a visionary with an exceedingly high intellectual understanding of the world we live in,as he always explains it with his utterly amazing imaginative mind. And pairing him up with Depp, was the most amazing thing that could ever ever happen.Johnny Depp is so Enigmatic in his approach that even though he was given a role that did not really impact the original Alice in wonderland, working with Tim made his role as a ""Mad Hatter"" take a step forward in an original idea of what The Hatter's world was like. And how could i forget Helena Bonham Carter, this actress is such a charmer, all the other female roles that were in the movie felt so weak in front of her. Her Portrayal as the ""off with head"" Red Queen was exquisite work of art. Even though we still did not find what the riddle meant, ""Why does the raven look like a desk?"" the only meaning i could think of after watching this magnificent work of art is : ""You work and work to give birth to your dark side when there is so much color and imagination to live for"".<br/><br/>I Highly recommend to those who know and can see what Tim is capable off."

","I know there are many reasons I liked this film. Linguistically it was just shy of genius but I think Lewis Carroll had something to do with that. No, no it was that this was the first film I had seen in a long time that expanded the concept of mental illness to children in a friendly way.It had me laughing when no one else was! It was beautiful and not impossible to guess what Burton was getting at visually. Just a beautiful, brilliant film. 9 stars... It has been a rarity for mental illness to be portrayed to youngsters. we simply haven't known how to do it. Lewis Carroll did with his book but it almost seems to me with less confrontation. The actors and actresses were wild looking. The redemptive advice Alice gives to her aunt about dispelling delusion was classic. This is something I have been waiting for, now about trying The Phantom Tollbooth."
"BrokenBison","6","4","13","5 March 2010"," Almost Burton... And then Disney said no...
","Alice was always going to be Burton's big film. Everyone, all the Burtonion Gothic children out there sitting waiting for next installment, thumbing copies of Oyster Boy, wanted Timmy to do Lewis Carols' Alice. 10 years ago, rumors were abound of a American McGee's Alice film, which, if Burton would have worked with McGee on, would have been a dark, yet inspired take on Alice.<br/><br/>Yet, we could have had that, now, in 2010; if it was not for Disney. After watching it, on 3D IMAX no less, it was the hand of Disney that manipulated what could have been a masterpiece into, what was, a generic post-LOR Disney epic, of a similar vein to Narina. It is, as if, the cigar chomping Mickey Mouse sat on Burton's shoulder telling him what he could and couldn't write. At times, pieces of Timmy Burtons style manages to squeeze itself through the cracks of the Disney facade. Little tit bits of his unique mark on cinema get through but its all made out to be nice and squeaky clean at the edges, just the way that good 'ol double M would want it. I understand if you want to target the children market Disney but don't put a repressed action hero doormouse in the form of Barbara Windsor and a whole menagerie of talking animals in it.<br/><br/>If you need to an image of how far Disney have taken their trademarking of this franchise, then all you need do is take a look at the White Queen's castle. Remind you of a particular castle you see every time you load up a Disney DVD? I feel sorry for TB, after all it should have been great. Those moments that are his are great, the best of the film. But it is the Disneyiness of it all that lets it down. Cut the Disney out and let Burton make his own film."

But this is egregious feminist twaddle that has as much to do with Lewis Carroll's Wonderland as Gumby has to do with nuclear physics, i.e., nothing at all. While it's visually stunning, and it is that, the story line is such a perversion that this film can only rank with ""Pocahontas"" as the rankest of polemic crap.<br/><br/>While I absolutely believe in the power of women to achieve great things, Linda Woolverton's screenplay makes me realize anew that talent is a minor component of Hollywood success.

"lomaran-1","5","3","9","11 March 2010"," Alice in ""So-Empty-of-Wonder-Land""
","*Readers, ye be warned. Spoilers abound.*<br/><br/>Tim Burton's latest work, ""Alice in Wonderland,"" has hit the theaters. In this age of remakes, I suppose it was inevitable that Lewis Carroll's famous story, already brought to life by Disney so many years ago, would get a revamp. The trailers for the film looked fantastic. It looked fun, dark, mysterious... and who better to bring Wonderland to life than the master of the bizarre, Tim Burton?<br/><br/>After seeing it for myself, five is all I can give it, and that seems a fair score. The film isn't terrible, but neither is it ""wonderful."" It quickly pales to the Disney version, anyway. While the visuals are good (and with the computer-imaging technology these days, how couldn't they be?), the rest of the film is, in a word, lackluster.<br/><br/>It should immediately be noted that this isn't the typical ""remake."" Instead of simply retelling Carroll's tale, Burton's film is actually a sequel, its story taking place some ten years or so after the original. Kudos here, I suppose, as at least Burton has brought something new to the table. But what he did bring is lacking.<br/><br/>To put it briefly: years after her original trip to Wonderland, Alice, now about 19, falls down the rabbit hole again. This time, however, she has been deliberately summoned to Wonderland, as it has been prophesied that she will slay the dreaded Jabberwocky and free the land from the tyrannical Red Queen. After a series of misadventures and re-introductions to her old friends, she ultimately faces the monster, defeats the Red Queen, saves the world... blah blah blah. Hardly an original premise, and to be honest, not well executed. There isn't really a solid story here: it all leads up to the fulfillment of said prophecy, but there isn't any build-up as the film nears the big showdown. The movie lacks suspense. It goes nowhere, and it doesn't go there very quickly, either.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the film is the lack of what Wonderland should have plenty of: wonder! Where's the magic? the madness? None of the delightful insanity of Carroll's world found its way into the film. Talking rabbits, freakish monsters, vanishing cats, and an army of giant playing cards all just show up in no particular order, with no wonder, no madness, not even introductions. If I hadn't seen the Disney version, I wouldn't have known those weird, red rectangular soldiers were supposed to be living playing cards. In fact, odds are if you aren't already familiar with the story, half the time you won't have the slightest clue what the heck you're looking at.<br/><br/>Like the movie itself, the characters aren't well developed. With the (possible) exception of Alice, you don't really care about anyone here, even if you do know the story. As Alice, Mia Wasikowska expresses none of the, again, ""wonder"" you'd expect her to feel after stumbling into a world where nothing makes any sense. Johnny Depp's performance was a bit disappointing. For a ""Mad Hatter,"" he was hardly ""mad."" In fact, beyond the occasional tantrum he has he really isn't ""mad"" at all, except for the fact that he can make sense of the whacked Wonderlandian vocabulary. On the other hand, his partner the March Hare seems to have been gifted the Hatter's madness in addition to his own. He's completely insane: he throws things, he twitches uncontrollably, and his speech mostly consists of sputtering, sniffling and the phrase ""Oh, no!"" The Hare is too mad, and the Hatter not mad enough. The others - the White Queen, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Blue Caterpillar, and the Knave of Hearts - are pretty forgettable. But on a good note, Helena Bonham-Carter was great as the Red Queen. The character was portrayed perfectly: unstable, quick to decapitate, and the only character in the film who is really as ""mad"" as she should be. Also the Cheshire Cat, my personal favorite, was fun to watch, though he was under-developed and lacked, yet again, ""wonder."" And, last and maybe least, there is the Jabberwocky itself, a CGI marvel whose two lines of dialogue are provided by none other than Christopher Lee (I wonder how much that cost). The monster was actually well done, but that isn't saying much. Even in Hollywood, it's hard to mess up a dragon.<br/><br/>The unfolding story, as I said earlier, lacks suspense, and therefore lacks payoff. With only one or two engaging characters, the film can lose your attention. The climax and ending are both predictable, and the part near the end, when Alice must decide whether or not to stay or return to her own world, is a blatant rip-off of Wizard of Oz. It may also be worth mentioning that, at least at my theater, the 3D was unremarkable. Halfway through I forgot it was 3D at all.<br/><br/>To conclude, Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" is, overall, mediocre. A few scenes will grab your attention: at least one I can think of may even embarrass you. But while it is entertaining, it desperately lacks the ""wonder"" and ""fun"" it needed.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm being overly critical, but I don't know. I expected more. More madness. More magic. More... wonder."
"AgentSands182","8","3","9","6 March 2010"," Good Movie!
","To the last reviewer.. legendary_badass or something terrible like that. If you are going to review a movie.. make sure you watch it and understand it first.<br/><br/>First of all it was not a major plot for the people in the THEATRE to find the identity of Alice, it was a plot for the characters in the MOVIE!!. So something like ""if u go to see a movie called Alice in Wonderland you should automatically assume..blah blah blah"" The point of all that was that the characters in the movie were looking for the right Alice from 13 years ago, and kept finding the wrong one, so now they are arguing if this is the right one or not. Im sure the characters aren't aware they are in a movie called Alice in Wonderland.. so there's bad point A from your review.<br/><br/>Point B. Johnny Depps character was the MAD hatter. He was insane, off his rocker, nuts. The fact he switched to Scottish accents throughout was on purpose because he was NUTS. Depp played this role to perfection. He turned a should be gimmick role, into a steal the show role.. as he often does.<br/><br/>Point C. The DUMB point that why are they looking for her after all these years when they have been fine. DID YOU WATCH THE MOVIE??? They have a calendar type thing that tells the future. in the near future there is a picture of a War, and then of Alice slaying the feared Jabbawake.. so they needed to FIND her to make this possible. GET IT? Some peoples ignorance astounds me.<br/><br/>Finally Point D. That she isn't surprised or all that crap. She has had the same dream about Wonderland EVERY night for the past 13 years. She is obviously eccentric and out of the box thinker. So as much as you can tell she is in wonderment and amazed, she also sub consciously has believed in the strange, therefore was calm.<br/><br/>Tim Burton was awesome once again, Depp was brilliant, Mia was great as Alice, Helena was funny and even Crispin did quite well. Some cheesiness in the story, but keep in mind its partly for kids after all.<br/><br/>Well done Burton Team!"
"cadillac20","7","3","9","5 March 2010"," Visually Appealing, But With A Lackluster Plot
","Some will be disappointed by Burton's attempt at Wonderland, while others will simply be satisfied by it's simple charm and wondrous visuals. I am in the latter category. While others may have been taken in immensely by this rendition, I was not one who got terribly excited about the film. My expectations were somewhat low, as Burton hasn't quite delivered on a few of his more recent excursions. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how entertained I was with the film, particularly in the lead, someone new to me who I quite enjoyed. <br/><br/>Certainly, it should come as no surprise that the new Alice looks great. There are a many wonderful things to see. I did, however, take issue with a few scenes that looked a little too animated. It made me wonder if this could have been a 3D animation as opposed to a live action that was quite heavy on the special fx. But, the problem evaporates quickly as the film progresses. Burton's typical goth style is in play here, with a Wonderland that is decaying from being abused by the Queen of Hearts. Adding to the visual scenery are several enjoyable characters, most notably Depp and Carter, playing the Madd Hatter and the Queen of Hearts respectively, but this world is full of wonderful characters, from the white rabbit to the march hare to tweedle dee and tweedle dumb. It's a great assortment of characters every bit as wonderful as one would remember them. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film is not much more memorable than its performances and scenery. The plot is very much straight forward and all emotional cues are obvious and unmoving. There is a humanity here, but you simply don't care much. In fact, I found the Red Queen, despite her vicious, child like behavior, to be the most relatable. There is a certain sadness, though she is quite mad, and in a way you feel sorry for her. Most other characters, even Alice, are fairly ordinary and there's not a lot of gray to them. It's almost as if they are a little too likable for their own good. Which is a real shame, because Wonderland is such a wonderful place. <br/><br/>This is certainly not a huge comeback for Burton. Just another in a long line of okay films that pale in comparison to his past days of Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and Ed Wood. Burton should really be doing more projects like those, where he added a touch of his own dark originality, even to an already told story. If he doesn't start treading some unfamiliar territory, his best days may just be behind him."
"fedor8","Null","2","5","5 October 2016"," A shoddy cast on top of a lazy script.
","Just another soul-less CGI orgy directed with no apparent effort. All flash but no charm. It's as if a bored computer directed this boring mess – right after a very confused human with silly hair cast it. HAL-9000 already ruined one important space mission. Perhaps ruining a dumb movie pales by comparison, but it was still unnecessary.<br/><br/>I cannot say enough bad things about the cast, the movie's glaring weakness. Wiakowska is as bland and average-looking as they come. Of all the pretty, charming girls out there looking to jump-start a movie career Burton couldn't find anyone better than THAT? You kidding me? (But what's to expect from a guy who marries a garden dwarf called Helena Bonham Carter. Taste in beauty?) Her line-delivery comes off as subdued and listless. She'd be ideal to play a young female accountant in some lame-ass drama that nobody really wants to see, but to cast her in a fantasy comedy – as the title character no less – shows extraordinary incompetence on the part of the film-makers. Burton either picks great actors for his roles or the worst; he doesn't seem to cater to the mid-quality range.<br/><br/>But Burton's casting screw-ups don't end there. Hiring Crispin Glover as anything other than a bizarre nerd is bringing optimism to absurd new levels. (Actually, hiring him – period – is pretty daft.) The man can't act! The industry had tried already to turn him into some kind of a cult-status mini-legend, kind of like Ron Howard's brother, and that might have worked with the more easy-to-please zombies, I mean viewers, but to me he will always be a dull nepotist with very limited abilities/range and low on charisma. To cast him as a VILLAIN, no less, means that Burton had been sniffing not just glue, not just Bolivian mushrooms while making this movie, but perhaps he'd even been sniffing the rabbit's poo marbles too.<br/><br/>You know what they say in show-biz circles: ""marry Tim Burton and you shall never have to kneel for roles again"". Helena Bonham Carter, the overrated British ""royal"" (her grandfather was Prime Minister! Her parents were in the movie industry in high positions, and there are all sorts of genetically exhausted lords and baronesses there too), married out of interest just as her ""royal"" ancestors had on numerous occasions, and much as Alice was supposed to. (The irony.) Don't you hate directors who ALWAYS have to stick their wives/girlfriends/mistresses into their films? It reeks of unprofessionalism, not to mention that it makes Burton look like a mug who let's wifey wear the pants. Helena's pathetic turn as an unfunny evil queen instantly reminded me of Miranda Richardson's funny portrayal of Queen Elizabeth in ""Blackadder"", or an inferior and idiotic imitation of it, to be precise. If Burton blew snot out of his nose watching his wife play this character, then he must be even more impressionable and easy-to-please than teeny-bopper fans of One Direction. <br/><br/>How about Anne Hathaway? She's supposed to be the movie's star beauty. We've always known that Burton's aesthetic sense was bizarre, in a good way - because many of his movies got a great look as a result of it, but it's a double-edged sword, isn't it. He may know what a creature or a castle should look like, but that also translates in a very deranged, skewered, warped taste in women. As if Hathaway didn't have a mouth already big enough to swallow a yawning hippo, he gave her a TON of lipstick which gives the impression that Anne only has a mouth. And that it's bigger than Stephen Fry's cat's mouth.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the Cheshire cat is supposed to be one of the stars of the story, but instead had been turned into a minor annoyance due to Fry's uninteresting, self-important, non-funny, stupid voice. <br/><br/>The only good move Burton made was casting Depp, who is fairly interesting. But even he struggles to keep our interest due to the shoddy script that amounts to not much more than a very stereotypical good-vs-evil plot that contains zero excitement – unless you're 5 years old. (In which case you anyway shouldn't be watching this coz Hathaway's huge mouth gave the movie an R rating.) Alan Rickman gets a tiny voice-over while Glover gets a key role! Burton Tim, shouldn't Rickman have played the villain? Anyone with half a brain would have cast Rickman as the Queen's henchman instead of that little nepotist Glover who obliterates that role.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes are half-way watchable, but this CGI opera then quickly deteriorates, due to shoddy casting choices, but also because the plot is so abysmally boring. The gags also fail, and they just keep failing. There are maybe 2-3 instances when something funny or amusing is being said.<br/><br/>And then, just to make sure we know how much he hates his audiences, Burton ends the movie with the tender hysterical yelping of one called Avril Lavigne. Did someone lobotomize Burton? No, wait: that's the result of working for Hollywood for such a long period of time. Anyone in his shoes ends up lobotomized. Must be something about the air in California."
"museumofdave","3","2","5","27 February 2013"," Wonderland Becomes A Battlefield and Alice Loses.
","While there many things to like in this film, what starts out as an imaginative and whimsical Trip to Wonderland becomes a tribute to the noisy wonders of CGI, a female empowerment film coupled with far too much Dungeons and Dragons action, a film that seemed designed for 13 year old boys with revenge on their mind. On the positive side, there is much to cherish--the sense of Cheshire Cat nuttiness was perfect, his textures breathtaking, the grin a nice combination of slightly fiendish and very friendly. The Mad Tea Party is zany and wildly inane just as author Carroll would wish, with Depp's Mad Hatter both unsettling and sometimes comforting--so far so good. I thought Anne Hathaway, too, captured an assurance that this was indeed fairy-tale in telling--but the film shortly evolves as just another battle movie, another Transformers spin-off, another noisy us vs. them, the same sort we experience in the media on the daily basis; the original Alice was an uneasy mix of wonderment and unease, a Victorians take on strange human behavior and logic gone wild, but there is nothing in the book to indicate that strange little Alice would put on armor and slay a dragon; one wonders if this is to lay groundwork for a video game to follow. And just for the record--Helena Bonham Carter needs some elocution lessons--half of what she said was lost in speed and attitude. For some this film might be worth watching once--and then return with joy to Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Frankenweenie for your best Tim Burton Fix."

","Recap: Stunned by the news that she is going to be proposed to, by a man with good standing but not of her liking at all, no less. Alice flees, following a white rabbit, and tumbles down a hole. There an very odd and peculiar, not to say dangerous, adventure awaits her. She tumbles into Wonderland, where a conflict rages between the Red Queen, a ruthless dictator currently in power, and the White Queen. And between them lands Alice, she is foretold to be the one that slays the Jabberwocky, a monster and the Red Queens most fearsome weapon. Therefore Alice is much sought after, by both sides. But how can she save Wonderland when she keeps believing it's just a dream<br/><br/>Comments: Now, I have never read the books, or that I can remember, seen any of the previous movies. But from some of the comments I infer that Tim Burton has made quite a big input to the story, so that it does not stay true to the original books. Tim Burton's movie does not, unfortunately, make me want to read more of it though.<br/><br/>Listed as a Family movie, I would not let any young children watch it, not alone anyway. Tumbling down the rabbit hole with Alice is like stepping into a world painted by Dali. It's very spectacular, the effects are many times just stunning, Burton is certainly very creative and inventive. But quite often, it is just disturbing. Well, it could be that I am a grown up and don't ""get it"". But I felt it being quite a dark and scary movie, especially if it's intended for a younger audience. Perhaps that is the best way of describing it, a horror movie for a ten year old.<br/><br/>As it should be, most of the characters are odd. Some more hilarious, some more in a mad scary way. Depp does a good Mad Hatter that falls somewhere in between. Otherwise I grew quite fond of Mia Wasikowska. Both in character and actress she was the beacon of light and reason. I also usually like Anne Hathaway, but cast here as the White Queen, it was a character that really didn't fit her. It is a far too passive character for her, and the pale appearance didn't do her justice either. I'm glad to have seen it, I can say that. The effects and the imaginative story are well worth the time. But having seen it once, I won't see it again.<br/><br/>5 rugged top hats out of 10."
"johnstrash1","3","2","5","13 February 2011"," What were they thinking??
","When you have what seems like a perfect combination of actors (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter), director (Tim Burton) and story (Alice in Wonderland, what else needs to be said), you would expect something phenomenal. Yet somehow they managed to totally screwed it up.<br/><br/>Granted, the actress who played Alice was a little one dimensional and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen just plain gave me the creeps, but there is an overall shortcoming here that goes beyond any of the cast. Some of the blame would have to go to Burton for what seems to be a restrained attempted at creating Wonderland. It could have been a little darker in atmosphere (not so much to freak out kids of course) while at the same time do a better job at capturing the feel of Lewis's version with weird and magical creatures at every turn. But to be fair a considerable amount of fault has to lie on the script itself.<br/><br/>Something that strikes you from the start is the idea of someone coming back to a fairy tale world without ever recalling being there before. Didn't Robin Williams already do this in Hook? But more importantly, why did they feel it necessary to make it some sort of sequel to the original, especially when there has been nothing made on a scale like this before. But even if you accept it as the next step in the story, it seems odd that they would contradict so much of the original story.<br/><br/>One of the things that sticks out to me is the inclusion of the Jabberwock. It's existence was only in a fable with in the story. And even if one was expecting to stretch this as to the fable actually being some sort of prophecy, then Alice killing it is a total contradiction as it was killed by a boy in the original telling.<br/><br/>Another aspect is the handling of the White Queen. As described by Lewis, the White Queen was stupid, fat and helpless as an infant. Instead, in the movie she was thin and majestic with a bizarre habit of holding her hands up like she was about to field a punt.<br/><br/>As for Alice herself, she was for some reason written as a grumpy little brat who was pretty rude to most people (and animals), then in the end turns into supergirl, so much to the point that it's just plain goofy. <br/><br/>There is some good stuff here. Carter's portrayal of the Red Queen was perfect. And how they did that with her head is beyond me. Depp did an pretty good job, but I would have preferred that he looked a tad older, though it's not a big deal. Overall, the voice acting was great. The Cheshire Cat, Catapillar, The White Rabbit and even the little servant frogs all sounded dead on. <br/><br/>Perhaps I am just ticked off at the missed opportunity for making a grand scale retelling of the original story, but I honestly did go into this with high hopes anyway. I would love to see the same group (at least Burton, Depp and Carter) take a shot at the story the way Carrol originally wrote it, with a new screen writer and a less reserved Burton behind the camera. But that will never happen"

They still don't actually make a movie where there is no movie. - As wild as you are about Depp, was it necessary to give the Hatter a bizarre, and occasional, Scots presence? - Setting up your Alice as a clunky, whiny heroine is not smart. - Do you sort of hate women, in that Alice and Hathaway's White Queen must look like they've been dead for a few weeks? Is Kate Moss your idea of an attractive young lady? - A cat that grins and speaks should be intriguing enough. You don't need to have him pop in and out like Nightcrawler in the X-Men, or spin through the air every minute.

","Who are you? I felt like the Blue Caterpillar as I watched this movie, without benefit of the water pipe. This production has flattened the intelligence of the original story and turned it into boilerplate Disney. Sad. No Dodo dialog. No Walrus. No Tweedle-Dumb-Dee repartee. No discernible March-Hare riddles. A vaudeville shadow of its source. Perhaps the American psyche is getting stupid because the diet offered up by its media is lacking in proper nutrients. Johnny Depp needs to let go of his zany thing for a while. I admire his talent, but this aspect of his repertoire is getting stale.

The original was a satire about language and thinking and about how society creates so much of a something about nothing.<br/><br/>And they took a knife to the story and butchered it for 2010 social tastes, because the idea of social ideology as a meaningless construct is 21st century heresy. Worse, even, than in Carroll's time. At least THEY had a Carroll to point out the inanity of it all! The plot device of Alice fighting the Jabberwocky was stupid and revolting at the same time.

The first 30 minutes were extremely painful to watch, but I said to myself ""Hey, I know this has Johnny Depp in it, so I'll wait for his character to come in and we'll see where it goes from there."" Johnny Depp's performance was pretty good, not as good as I was hoping for, but passable to say the least. However, the rest of the movie was a pile of cow dung. Johnny Depp could have been amazing in this movie, could have had his best performance ever, but it still would have been just Johnny Depp standing in a heaping pile of cow dung. I just don't get this movie, there's no, 'thing'. There's no, there's no... plot, although, no, there is a plot, albeit not very good, but it does exist. So what is it I'm looking for? Hmmmm... ah yes, the 'why' behind the movie. Why are they doing this, why, why, why. Why do they need Alice to come back? The White Queen (or w/e her name is, Anne Hathaway, that one) seems to be living quite peacefully in her castle. The Red Queen has had 13 years and has done... nothing, so, why not everyone bunk up with ol' Whitey? She seems fairly well off. You know how in a movie, there's the big climax moment that's been built up to and you're thinking ""Oh boy, this is when this all gets resolved because this happened and that happened and now all of this is happening because so and so did such and such and now they're in this winner-take-all very intense battle!!!!"" Well, Alice in Wonderland had that, but I'll edit it so that it's more appropriate Oh boy, now they're in this winner-take-all very intense battle!!!!"" There's no real lead up to it, it just kinda, happens. I found myself not caring about it because there was no point. I felt like 'SO FLIPPING WHAT?' Nothing has really happened to make me care, at all, about any of the characters.<br/><br/>If you're thinking of watching this movie, then don't. It's just a waste of your time, unless you like complaining about things then by all means watch this movie, you'll have plenty to complain about guaranteed!"

","I loved the original ""Alice in Wonderland"" book of Lewis Carroll. I also liked the adaptation made by Disney in 1951, and the dark version made by Jan Svankmajer in 1988. And Tim Burton, being a very talented filmmaker seemed to be (At first) the best choice for director for adapting one of the most influential fantasy books ever written.<br/><br/>However, the final result is somewhat disappointing, mostly because this is not one literal-adaptation, but a completely new story inspired in the original tale. But, to be completely honest, the result wasn't entirely bad. <br/><br/>Actually,I consider that ""Alice in Wonderland"" was a decent, entertaining film for the whole family. But a more one faithful adaptation of the original story would have been something much better.<br/><br/>This version done by Tim Burton is closer to ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" rather than the original book, but it still worked very well. It was very funny to watch, like most of the films directed Tim Burton (Despite the ugly and unappealing CGI) and all the actors make a great work with their new version of the classic characters. <br/><br/>Don't expect this to be a faithful adaptation of the original book, otherwise you will be very disappointed."

The film then becomes The Matrix, with Alice as the Chosen One destined to fight the indestructible demon and save Sion/Underworld.

And there's Johnny Depp, being mad and Glaswegian at various turns.<br/><br/>I think it was meant to be about leaving childhood behind, and taking control of your own life. But as one glimpse at the buffoon Alice is meant to marry telegraphs the fact that this won't happen, there is no intrigue or ambiguity.

The film isn't nearly as good as Burton's best work, but it isn't nearly as bad as some claim it is either.

","After going to see Alice in Wonderland for the second time yesterday, I must admit I am shocked by the amount of bad reviews it has been getting. I have to say, I wasn't overly eager to see this film, I thought it was going to be another one of those very Disney, sugar-coated movies. I was wrong. This version of Alice in Wonderland has a darker, funnier side that can only be expected from Tim Burton that made the whole movie thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>The plot is admittedly simple, but very effective, Alice, who is now 19, returns to Wonderland after a proposal from a vile ginger. She then meets up with some familiar faces who tell her that the Red Queen has taken over Underland (as it is actually called). Alice must stop the Red Queen's reign of terror and regain her 'muchness'. <br/><br/>While the plot was a little lacking, it was made up with the absolutely superb acting of some A-list names. Johnny Depp- Let me make one thing clear. I am NOT a Johnny Depp fan. I don't automatically love any movie he's in, just because he's in it. This was the only movie that I absolutely adored him in. He played the Mad Hatter perfectly and he just absolutely made this movie for me. Depp is an amazing actor, no doubt about it, his other characters just never did it for me. I loved him in this film however because he really made the Mad Hatter his own and he was just a delight to watch because you could tell he was having so much fun. Mia Wasikowska was an amazing choice for Alice. She just has this innocent and sweet vibe around her, which was essential for playing Alice. She really brought this character to life and I don't think I could of picked a better choice for Alice. Helen Bonham Carter played the Red Queen, who had an ego as large as her head, and was extremely likable for someone who was meant to be the 'bad guy', and also, she was surprisingly funny too, with her obsession for beheading. She carried off the Red Queen brilliantly and stole whatever scene she was in. Stephen Fry- OK, whoever thought of getting Stephen Fry to do the voice of the Cheshire Cat was a genius. His smooth, almost smug voice matched the character of the Cheshire Cat impeccably. I never really liked the Cheshire Cat in any of the other Alice in Wonderland movies, I always found him a little too creepy. In this version, he was one of my favorite characters, and that was mainly thanks to Stephen. He was simply amazing and fit into the role so perfectly.<br/><br/>Enough about the excellent acting, the other thing that made the movie so enjoyable for me was the visual effects and the computer created world of Underland. It can only be summed up in one word - stunning. I went to see it in 3D and Im so glad I did. Some of the scenes were absolutely breathtaking, particularly when she's falling down the rabbit hole or fighting the Jabberwocky. The CGI characters were amazing to look at, especially Matt Lucases' characters, Tweedledum and Tweedledee. I often found myself leaning forward, trying to absorb every detail of Underland. Its colorful and beautiful at times, at others its desolate and a little scary. Im so glad that technology has caught up with Tim Burtons imagination and can produce such beautiful movies like this.<br/><br/>The only problems I had with this movie was Anne Hathaway's character, the White Queen was a little annoying at times, the 3D, while it was beautiful in some scenes, it was unnecessary in others and it was too short...I never wanted it to end! Altogether, they are very minor complaints. I am already planning to go back and see it a 3rd time, and I will be counting the days until it comes out on DVD. An excellent film, well worth going to see"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","2","5","30 March 2010"," Tim needs a break from the remakes
","Ah, Tim Burton, one of my favorite directors of all time. Now when it comes to his original ideas, his movies are just incredible and something from a different world. But when it comes to his remakes, for some odd reason he can never get something right with making the film into his own or even something that was respectable to the original story. Now granted one thing I love about him is that he tries to stay true to the original book, as we see in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, we see that now with Through the Looking Glass. Alice in Wonderland is one of the most disturbing stories you could think about, but it's an extremely memorable Disney classic. No matter what age you are, if you've seen the movie, it's a great one but always manages to give you the shivers with some of the imagery and ideas. Again, hate to make the comparison, but like The Chocolate Factory, Tim and Johnny Depp team up again to make him even more disturbing looking than ever. I love Johnny Depp, but what the heck is he doing with these characters? He's making them so painfully uncomfortable to watch on screen that it took away from the story, at least for me. He didn't steal the movie, I'd give the credit to Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen, she was a pleasure to watch and makes a memorable villain.<br/><br/>Troubled by a strange recurring dream, nineteen-year-old Alice Kingsleigh attends a party that she is told is an engagement party to wed her to Hamish Ascot, whose family now owns her deceased father's trading firm. Unsure of how to reply, she runs away to chase after a rabbit, and accidentally falls into a rabbit hole. The only exit in the world is too small, causing Alice to use a series of potions to shrink and escape. Upon exiting, she is welcomed by the White Rabbit, the Dormouse, and Tweedledum and Tweedledee, who question her identity as ""the right Alice."" They take her to the Caterpillar, who decides that she is ""not hardly Alice."" Meanwhile, Iracebeth the Red Queen, who has conquered Underland by stealing the crown from her sister Mirana the White Queen, is informed by the Knave of Hearts that Alice has returned to Underland, causing her to send Bayard the bloodhound to find her. The wandering Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat, who takes her to a tea party, where she meets the Mad Hatter, March Hare, and the Dormouse. The Hatter decides that she is ""absolutely Alice,"" settling any doubt. Now they have decided that she is the one who is going to save their world and the White Queen's crown.<br/><br/>The film certainly has it's flaws, it goes a little too Chronicles of Narnia for me towards the end. Also, I know this is a movie, I know I'm going to ruin the story, but I couldn't help but think throughout this whole movie, Alice has a potion that can make her into a giant, she has to destroy the evil Red Queen, why not just make herself bigger and squash all of her soldiers? Again, forgive me, I know it's Hollywood, the movie would be only 5 minutes long if I made it, but it just seemed to convenient for no one to bring up. Also what the heck was with the break dance at the end? It felt too out of place and once again so uncomfortable to watch on screen, that it took away from the story. But, while Alice in Wonderland has problems that it does need to work on, visually, it's really amazing. This was a great 3D experience, the Red Queen looked amazing and very real. I loved Anne Hathaway as the White Queen and her world of bright and pure color that made it just lovely to watch. As for the actors, Helen took the crown for performance, Anne did a decent job as well. But as for Johnny Depp, I don't know what drug he's taking, but he really needs to step back. He's good at playing eccentric characters as we see with Edward Scissorhands and Jack Sparrow, but as for Willy Wonka and that Mad Hatter, it's too much and extremely painful to watch. Mia as Alice did an OK job, nothing really memorable, but she couldn't do much as the script needs some major improvements. OK, before I run out of room, I'm sorry to babble, but I'd say this is worth the look in the theater as a matinée, but nothing more as it's more visual than story driven.<br/><br/>6/10"
"david-phillips-4","4","2","5","22 March 2010"," 3D that left me feeling flat
","Tim Burton's re-imagining of a well known and often told story in 3D left me feeling a little flat. The movie nips along at a decent pace and takes us from Alice's oppressive aristocratic life into wonderland, a place she had visited and all but forgotten about many years before. Her adventure this time is to take on the jabberwocky, as foretold in a scroll that contains everything that has happened and ever will. As long as 3D, in this quality at least, is a new fad, it is impossible not to compare the experience with other movies viewed in the same format. I have Avatar to compare it against and until I see more 3D movies of differing genres, Avatar will generally be the benchmark. And it is here that I find my main issue with the movie. It is perhaps unfair to compare the two, but my comparison is based upon the feelings I have while watching; how immersed in the movie do I get, does the depth perception add to how a 2D experience might be, etc. My problem with this is that Avatar, whilst also being a fantasy film, did have a lot of its content based upon reality. In particular I am thinking of the landscapes being based upon rainforests, which at least gave me some form of recognition. Whereas, Wonderland, rightly so, is much more abstract and outlandish. To me, that gave it a cartoon feel and so the depth given to the movie was not much of an enhancement. It reminded me a little of some of the Popeye cartoons that used model sets in the foreground to try to add a layer of depth. Which seems like a folly to me: it's a cartoon, who needs depth? Having said that, some of the 3D works well enough, but it does come across as though the movie was not intended to be 3D from its original conception, as the 3D is not utilised or played upon enough. The story is standard fare of Alice being thrust into a situation she does not deem herself capable of handling, but she learns that she is braver and more resilient than she gave herself credit for. The jokes for the adults that are so often a source of amusement in these types of kids' movies was not apparent – the Toy Story trailer delivered more ""adult"" humour in 30 seconds than this did in 1hr 50mins. The twisted and dark view that is so often associated with Tim Burton was also lacking. In fact, it was a straight story told in a straight way: no plot twists, no darker moments and nothing to grab your attention. I found myself quite happy to let the story unfold in front of me without having to engage the brain other than to try to guess who did the voices and spot the occasionally clever / occasionally clumsy references to Alice's ""real"" world. Mia Wasikowska is competent, but hardly stretched in the title role and she is ably supported by the voices of Stephen Fry, Matt Lucas and Timothy Spall to name a few, with Fry perhaps just stealing the show from the others. This brings us to two long-time collaborators of Tim Burton's: Helena Bonham Carter lazily rehashes Miranda Richardson's excellent portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I in Blackadder II. She often has the sharpest lines, but they fall flat when applied via such an obvious impression. Johnny Depp does bring an eccentricity to the Mad Hatter, Glaswegian accent included, but haven't we seen this sort of thing from him before? Johnny seems to be caught in a cycle of churning out eccentric characters with unique quirks (usually accents): Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka and now the Mad Hatter. Whatever happened to the Johnny Depp we saw in Blow, Donnie Brasco, etc? Admittedly, I have not seen Public Enemies. One can almost imagine the scene of Depp, Bonham Carter and Burton sat around massaging each other's egos and conspiring to ""bring something new"" to their characters. Which may seem like a good idea until the finished article reaches the screens and the audience is left thinking it is one gimmick too far. The film is good clean fun, but I can't help thinking that this film could have been much more than that. And, to me, the 3D was wasted here, as it added little to the experience. www.writeronthestorm.wordpress.com"

","So gauging by my summary, being a small unhappy face, you can probably tell I was not a fan of this movie. Sure, before I saw it, I was on-board. Clips and art, it looked so promising. How an hour and a half does change things. I really want to hear from Tim Burton that he is absolutely thrilled with the cut of this film. Because I am not buying it. It wreaks of studio chopping, this film is a pretentious mess. But Disney knows two things: Alice is a marketable brand, and Tim Burton is a marketable man. So, this movie will do well, but its revenue is hardly deserved. This story is not clever, tries to add a sturdy narrative to the story, fails in every regard and destroys the tone of the movie by having the most mind boggling, out of place dance in a movie, PERIOD. That better win an accolade, as it is soo ballsy and uncomfortable, it feels more like it was done on a dare rather than creative vision. The cast is here, with some great performances even, the effects are OK, but we never get to explore Wonderland because Tim's Alice is running all the time. (I should note that I saw the 2D version) But even then, I went in expecting cleverness, and found the script believes we are all idiots. Underland? Ummm no, that was the poorest name correction I've seen in film, and utterly unnecessary. It reads like this: Oh I really like that idea, but I want to put my own spin on it! Lewis Carroll had it all wrong, I should do him the favour of correcting his spelling blunder! ...<br/><br/>This all of course spins on the needle end of a feminist undertone, that while I applaud the notion, is executed horribly. This is Tim's first true failure to me, and even with the intimidating cast he has assembled, it seems fitting the last scene of the movie is on a ship, as the whole production should go down with it. Cruel words? Maybe. But a remake, or sequel should only be attempted should a) the new material add something fresh to the property or b) be necessary to resolve any unturned circumstances in the original. Alice had neither, the original story remains the best. Very disappointed."

","It seemed like a no-brainer: the eccentric, visionary genius of Tim Burton (""Ed Wood,"" ""Sweeney Todd"") paired with the eccentric, surreal literary work of Lewis Carroll seemed a recipe for something that could be nothing less than mind-blowing, especially when the literary work in question is something as beloved and resonant in popular culture as ""Alice in Wonderland."" It's a shame the reality portends a less-than-flattering cinematic experience. What really happened here is anyone's guess: Burton, after floating on a career high in the wake of ""Big Fish,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" and ""Sweeney Todd"" (one of his best films), transformed a world-renowned tale into something so bombastic and scattershot that it often feels like a mega-budget Terry Gilliam movie. ""Alice in Wonderland"" really owes more to the broadness of ""Mars Attacks!"" than the controlled maturity of Burton's recent works. The film is stuffed with eccentric characters, but barely a single relative emotion; the dialog, delivered in English accents by frequently hyperactive actors, borders on the incomprehensible. As Burton's long-reliable muse, Johnny Depp has essayed many memorable roles under his direction, but as the Mad Hatter, delivers a lisping performance so wildly over-the-top that it barely registers (his clown makeup and red fright wig doesn't help matters). And despite the film's much-hyped use of 3D, that aspect comes off as curiously pedestrian, with very few scenes that take full advantage of the effect (or perhaps it's a case of bad timing: in the wake of the fantastically immersive world of ""Avatar,"" everything else looks like child's play by comparison), resulting in a visual experience that lets the viewer down almost as much as the flatly-rendered narrative. By the end, my frustrated mind could only wonder, without answer, where ""Alice in Wonderland"" really went wrong."
"Iain-215","5","2","5","21 March 2010"," Looks good but ultimately disappointing
","What's sad about Tim Burton's 'Alice In Wonderland' is that there is nothing new or original about it. Apparently Burton felt 'no connection' to the original stories and was uninterested in filming a new take on them. What we have then, are Carrol's characters uprooted and re-written into a new story by Linda Woolverton but its a story that has been done many, many times before and is therefore utterly predictable and bland. It seems that Hollywood must have a formula now for fantasy epic-type films and this new 'Alice' duly ticks all the boxes.<br/><br/>So, we find Alice on a quest involving a (fairly weak) moral dilemma, all the characters and places have to have fussy Tolkeinesque names (including an evil sounding double-barrelled place name for the Red Queen's realm), most of same characters are now irredeemably cute to fit in with modern pre-conceptions (sword-wielding dormouse a-la Narnia, doe-eyed heroic CGI dog a-la all the other doe-eyed heroic CGI dogs in recent CGI movies) and (of course) a giant climactic battle between good and evil! Its all a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>The story is pretty uninvolving. There's an attempt to make us 'feel' for Alice's friends (and when were these creatures ever her friends anyway? None of them are especially friendly in the books) but as none of them have any real substance, its virtually impossible to feel for them. The Mad Hatter has an important role (of course he has - he's Johnny Depp) and I suspect that we are supposed to 'feel' for him but pathos and the Hatter don't really go together and he ends up being just rather creepy. Alice goes on a couple of times about 'needing the help' of her 'friend' the Blue Caterpillar but in the event, he doesn't contribute very much. There is much talk about how Alice is changing as the story goes on but she's actually pretty much the same at the end as she was at the start - did we ever believe she was going to marry the foppish redhead? I am forty three and have no children so I'm not best placed to say whether it succeeds as a children's film but there were quite a lot of children in the audience at the screening I attended and scarcely a chuckle from any of them. In my opinion, this is where the film fails the source material - it has very little charm and very little humour; it is ALL about the visuals which brings me to...<br/><br/>PLUS POINTS - It looks fantastic! Most of the creatures look good. I particularly liked the Cheshire Cat (steals the film) and frog and fish footmen. Apart from the initial garden scene, the landscape of Underland is a little dull and uninspiring. The White Queen's realm is pretty but in a rather forced, Rivendell kind of way whilst the evil Red Queen goes for a more 'Dead Marshes-faces-in-the-water' kind of look BUT it is all well rendered and very impressive. Some of the acting is very good - Helena Bonham-Carter was the only one who made me laugh a couple of times, Ann Hathaway seems to want to play the evil one and hints at it throughout her otherwise Glinda-like performance and Depp is impressive if not ultimately successful (hated the intermittent Scottish accent - were we referencing Braveheart?). A few scenes worked for me - most involving the Red Queen and the start of the tea party scene which threatened to be almost conventional, and therefore genuinely amusing and charming, Alice! Otherwise, it was all a bit of a mess. The formulaic fantasy-epic film has been done much better elsewhere if that's what you're looking for and if you're looking for a good film of 'Alice In Wonderland', there's a decent one kicking about somewhere with Miranda Richardson as the Queen of Hearts and Martin Short as a genuinely batty Hatter!"
"dercnat1994","2","2","5","20 March 2010"," This movie is terrible!
","Tim Burton has gone insane! If Lewis Carrol was watching this from whichever afterlife, he would haunt Tim Burton forever! Instead of remaking the original book or even following the same unconnected narrative, Burton decides to tie Alice in Wonderland together with some horribly clichéd Hollywood script. The only time this film works is when the narrative abandons the main story and abandons focusing on Burton's prized possession, Johnny Depp; instead giving the ""minor characters"" some screen-time. However, this happens so infrequently that it's like someone is drowning you in a scummy pond only to momentarily let you resurface for some fresh air every half an hour. By the end you're either dead or, congratulations, you can hold your breath for a very long amount of time. On the other hand, the performance by Stephen Fry and Matt Lucas are amazingly well done and the special effects are astounding. My main complaint is Mr. Burton and to some extent Johnny Depp."
"spikemaze","3","2","5","19 March 2010"," OK if you don't have any expectations
","After having read a bunch of reviews before watching Alice in Wonderland, I'd lost most of all my expectations to the film. I only expected to see some pretty 3D... (as it was my first film in 3D)<br/><br/>The 3D really sucked. It's fine in the beginning, but after a while it's just annoying.<br/><br/>The movie on the other hand was not horrible. It wasn't a real Tim Burton movie - only the character Hamish reminded me of something Tim Burton would put in a movie. <br/><br/>But having said that, it wasn't a bad movie. Yes, it was quite boring and though it contained a lot of the great actors, who normally shine through every film, it was clear all the way through that the whole thing was filmed in front of a green screen. They lacked connection, not only to their surroundings, but also to their fellow actors. It was clearly too difficult for the actors and they probably did the best they could. Johnny Depp didn't seem at all like Willy Wonka or Jack Sparrow to me(okay, perhaps the latter once or twice), but he didn't become the role as you normally see with him. Maybe because he didn't know who Hatter really was. This was a confusing character. He didn't seem directly Mad, just like he had a bit too many personalities (one of them reminding of Jack Sparrow). The other actors did OK too with the character and script they had been given. There was some overacting here and there, but all in all they could have done much worse. The main reason why some people (also me actually) is disappointed with the acting is that we naturally expect so much more from such great actors.<br/><br/>What saved the movie for me was the talking animals - though I normally loathe these things in movies. The voice acting over-shone the ""real life"" acting, especially Stephen Fry was wonderful. And the animals made the movie fun too.<br/><br/>I think that if Tim Burton had made this film as in the old days with real surroundings and not too many animations (a la Beetlejuice), the movie could've been great. The actors would have been able to act with their surroundings and communicate with each other which probably would improve their acting a great deal - 'cause we know they can act. Or else Burton should have made it as a real animation film.<br/><br/>I missed the Tim Burton heart of the film. The problem is that when you go to see a Tim Burton film, you're not gonna be satisfied with a ""normal"" film. And that is what Alice in Wonderland is: A ""normal"" film with way too many special effects."
"dextertrax","3","2","5","16 March 2010"," Hook 2.0
","Painful.<br/><br/>Walking into the film it seemed reasonable to expect a quasi-faithful adaptation of ""Alice in Wonderland"" (I doubt Tim Burton would *ever* lower himself to making a straight adaptation). 20 minutes into the film I realized those expectations were setting the bar a little too high...<br/><br/>This film has far more in common with ""Return to Oz"" or ""Hook"" than it does to Lewis Carroll. Essentially an unofficial sequel to the Alice series, this version relies heavily upon our knowledge of the source material so that it can poach the visual elements and discard the meat and bones that made the book(s) so influential. After an interminable opening sequence we are rapidly introduced to the Wonderland ensemble absent the charm and the curiosity that made them household names. <br/><br/>Recharacterized and inexplicably dreary, these characters plod about the movie with the sole purpose to sloppily propel the narrative forward. This is probably the most criminal misstep of the entire film - we're never given the chance to sit back and enjoy them or the world they inhabit. Instead we're consistently forced to pay attention to a storyline that could have been written (with room to spare) on a table napkin.<br/><br/>This was very clearly put together by someone who had no understanding of what made the source material so memorable. I could be somewhat more forgiving if the movie had been titled *something* else (Return to Wonderland, anyone?) as I'm not a purist by any means. <br/><br/>This is not to say the film would be any better; simply that it would have less to be directly compared against. However, no matter what angle I look at Burton's Wonderland from I'm still left watching a dull film starring a dull cast with saccharine visuals that dull the senses quickly.<br/><br/>By dullards for dullards. Pass."
"toddclancy","Null","2","5","15 March 2010"," This could have been something special...
","When I heared Tim Burton was doing a Alice in Wonderland film I was super excited. I read all the news about it and followed along as the film was made. When I saw the trailer I was even more excited as the trailer made the film seem epic and great. After I walked out of the theater last night I was less then impressed.<br/><br/>I love Tim Burton movies, edward scissorhands, sleepy hollow, etc are some of my favourite movies and Tim Burton creates incredible worlds and visuals. Alice had the incredible world and visuals but the story and some of the acting just fell short.<br/><br/>The writing in this film was sub par IMO. I thought the pacing was a bit too fast and never really got the viewer into the story. I never really cared about Alice or the other characters. This movie seemed to be all about the visuals, and while they are great that doesn't make a movie great. Avatar had amazing visuals and a not so original story but at least the story was told in a way that you care about the man character and there was somewhat of a story to support the visuals.<br/><br/>I wasn't even that impressed with Johnny Depp in this movie, it seemed like a paycheck movie for him. The actress who played Alice was good but she never seemed curious about any of the creatures and her attitude that this was just a dream got really old, but i guess thats Burton's fault not Mia's.<br/><br/>I think this could have been a really special movie, I think Burton should have thrown aside the whole 3d, cgi deal and made a dark, beautiful smaller budget movie with incredible actors(still have Depp as the hatter) and made something he could be proud of and not just a 3D spectacle riding on Avatar's insanely huge coat tails. I hope this is not the kind of movies we will see from Burton in the future. I hope he finds his roots somehow."

","OK so my issues with this film just to get it off my chest <br/><br/>Mia Wasikowska - Alice - Horrid Simply Horrid she was bland and un-entertaining..<br/><br/>Johnny Depp - Mad Hatter - Simply not Mad enough.. I have been witness to Mr.Depp's Insanity in film. He could of done this movie A LOT more justice by playing the Mad Hatter just a little more crazy then what he did. It was mild for him, which for me was disappointing because I thought he would of taking this part to the extreme like he did for Willy Wonka, but sadly no.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter - Red Queen - Excellent job .. as intense and evil as I presumed to see the red queen<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway - White Queen - WTH??? Honestly I did not think I would ever see Anne Hathaway Fluttering around like Mortisha Adams all. I did not enjoy this character. It could have been done differently with a more Burton Flare..<br/><br/>Crispin Glover - Stayne – Knave of Hearts - An awesome presentation of the character.. kudos <br/><br/>Matt Lucas - Tweedledee / Tweedledum - Hilarious<br/><br/>Stephen Fry - Cheshire Cat - I loved this version of Ches <br/><br/>Michael Sheen- White Rabbit -Another Job well done <br/><br/>Alan Rickman - Blue Caterpillar- He had me laughing just wish he was in the movie more <br/><br/>Barbara Windsor- Dormouse -Babs had me laughing at the mouse from the get go.. <br/><br/>a nice portrayal Overall good movie worth the money to go see but disappointed.. I have always loved the Burton/Depp combo but I was disappointed by this big time. From Edward To Sweeny to Willy Wonka these two normally have what it takes but this time they let their talent slide and not shine.<br/><br/>I just hope that the next one they do together is so much better then this and I wish Depp to throw himself into the roles like he normally does.<br/><br/>but that is all LOL"

","There are a few problems I find with this movie.<br/><br/>1. Mad Hatter isn't mad enough. The guy just isn't charming here. I don't know why. It's Johnny Depp and he's usually excellent with strange roles like this. For some reason he's not as mad as he should be and that is vastly disappointing since a lot of us is expecting him to charm the hell out of us.<br/><br/>2. Movie isn't funny enough. There are just so much more that could have been done. The characters are there. They just didn't explore them thoroughly. Instead, we see half-baked attempts that are neither original (far from it) nor funny. Which brings me to my next point...<br/><br/>3. Movie felt rushed. Well, I would like a little more character development, especially those creatures from Wonderland, even the villains. I do not feel connected at all to the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie felt bland and forgettable with linear storyline and recycled humor."

","Oh dear oh dear. Here is another film ruined through poor scriptwriting. Linda Woolverton has only ever written derivative works and her lack of imagination shows. The dialogue is truly mind numbing, the plot thinner than a wafer and the reward for watching completely lacking. This is a shame because the animation, choice of acting voices, costumes and settings are superb. I really didn't want to pan this film but I have no alternative. It is a travesty. A wasted opportunity. I really can't think what possessed Tim Burton in persisting with this limp piece of work. The 3D is often not very effective and looks as two dimensional as the script. See it if you must. It will not survive long and will doubtless be found in the bargain basket once available on DVD."
"gregeichelberger","4","2","5","13 March 2010"," Let Lewis Carol do his OWN writing, please
","Here's a word I never thought I would use in describing a Tim Burton film - boring.<br/><br/>Yes, dull, tedious, monotonous and just plain boring. These are words NO ONE should have to use in relating a film based upon one of the true classics of English literature, ""Alice In Wonderland,"" but Burton, who has directed some of my favorite films (""Batman,"" ""Beelejuice,"" ""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""Ed Wood,"" ""Edward Scissorhands,"" etc.) somehow manages the impossible.<br/><br/>And it's not to say that Burton does not attempt to give the movie some stunning visual presence, he does, thanks to cinematographer Dariusz Wolski (""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street""). Scene after scene are wonderful to behold (this is especially true in 3-D).<br/><br/>The problem is that the director tries to cram too much into the film's brief 110-minute running time, not only incorporating ""Alice,"" but Carol's semi-epic poem, ""The Jabberwocky,"" as well as elements of ""Howard's End,"" ""Prince of Narnia"" and ""Joan Of Arc."" It's all far too much for the children the movie is aimed at, as well as the adults who bring them.<br/><br/>It begins bad when Alice is now a teenager (played by a most emotionless and lethargic Australian actress, Mia Wasikowska, ""Amelia""), who keeps having nightmares about her first trip to Wonderland as a child.<br/><br/>Hey, here's a hint, film THAT version instead! Alice as a feisty pre-feminist teenybopper is nowhere NEAR as interesting as the tale of the little girl lost in a world of (possibly her own) imagination. Having her as a belligerent teen ruined much of this film for me.<br/><br/>Anyway, Alice is now being courted by prissy Lord Ascot (Tim Pigott-Smith) and intimidated by his stuffy upper-crust mother, Geraldine James. There's a dead-end plot of her catching her sister's husband cheating on her and then she runs away and falls into the famed rabbit hole. Thankfully, Burton did not spend too much time on this unnecessary exposition.<br/><br/>Once inside the hole, the fantasy and visual delights of the picture can truly be appreciated. Of course, Alice drinks the potion that makes her small and then eats the cake that causes her to grow to enormous heights (somewhat). She then meets some of the more recognizable characters from the book, the March Hare (voiced by Paul Whitehouse), Dormouse (Barbara Windsor), Dodo Bird (Michael Gough), Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), the terrible CGI'd Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb (Matt Lucas) and the Blue Caterpillar (Alan Rickman).<br/><br/>Soon, she is introduced (or RE-introduced, if you will) to the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp in his 100th Tim Burton film, doing his best Jack Sparrow meets Willy Wonka impersonation). The two don't exactly hit it off, but when the evil Queen of Hearts (Helena Bonham Carter) sends her playing card soldiers to look for her, they become necessary allies.<br/><br/>There is also a creepy sexual tension between Alice and the Hatter that was certainly not in the book (even though Lewis was reportedly infatuated with 7-year-old Alice Liddell, his model for the title character).<br/><br/>The Queen, by the way, is a CGI creation with a huge head. Why she has a huge head is far, far beyond my ability to contemplate. The novelty effect, however, wore out quickly and I was forced to stare at her disturbingly large cranium throughout the motion picture.<br/><br/>Aiding the monarch's nasty designs is Crispin Glover (George McFly of ""Back to the Future"" fame) as Stayne, the Knave of Hearts. It was good to see Glover in a film again and one of the few characters I actually liked here.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Hatter is captured and Alice must turn into a commando to free him before the Queen shouts, ""Off with his head!"" (which she does, over and over and over and over again). To add to this plot complication, Alice enlists the aid of the White Queen (Anne Hathaway in the same make-up used by Bette Davis in ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?""), who resides in a snow-globe of a kingdom.<br/><br/>Meeting on a chessboard in a ""Lord of the Rings""-type showdown, the Queen of Hearts releases her not-so-secret weapon, the Jabberwocky, which is basically a horned dragon. Okay, how many times have we seen such an inclusion (""Enchanted,"" ""Harry Potter,"" ""The Sword and the Dragon,"" ""Beowulf,"" ""Eragon,"" etc., etc., etc.)? Frankly, I'm as tired of lame dragon effects as I am of directors changing original material to meet their egotistical cravings.<br/><br/>Was all of this a dream? Was it real? Do we care? Did we just see Johnny Depp do a crazed Michael Jackson imitation? After her adventures through the looking glass, Alice then returns to Sense & Sensibility manor to give the quivering Lord Ascot her answer on his proposal.<br/><br/>By then, I had completely lost interest in the film, Lewis Carol, Tim Burton and life in general. Even though this movie was made by Disney, instead of paying to see this installment, just rent the studio's animated 1951 classic or better off, enjoy the original book."
"Quinoa1984","4","2","5","13 March 2010"," bizarre (and not-so bizarre) eye candy, an ideal cast, uneven results
","Tim Burton should be ideal to direct an adaptation of Lewis Carroll's stories set Through the Looking Glass. And, as it turns out, he is. But this is not a real 'Alice' story like we've seen before. It feels more like a Wonderland story by committee, the sequel, where Alice returns at the age of twenty, has some disassociation from her first time down the rabbit hole, and is told 'it is written' or whatever that she has to face the Jabberwocky, and slay it. It's not that the story is entirely bad, but the way that the screenwriter Linda Woolverton puts it, nothing is really fresh the way one might hope for. The designs go some way to change things up, mostly on the human characters, and it usually looks pretty and bright and dark and ominous and surreal. Which is just right. But the story needed work, an injection of the 'less-business-as-usual' juice.<br/><br/>It's hard to exactly pinpoint, but I can give some guesses. For one thing, Burton's film is in large part set in a CGI landscape. One misses the days when Burton would film on breathtaking sets like in Batman or Edward Scissorhands. I'm reminded of the criticism of the Star Wars prequels, which I have made from time to time, that the computer effects drown out the potential human elements or things of interest in the story. I might be able to cut some more slack to the film if it weren't so beholden to the HUGE CGI effects (one wonders if Wonderland all took place behind blue-screen, certain actors included). It's hard to ignore, however, how rigid everything seems, from the attack from that big dog-like creature with the missing eye, to the Jabberwocky itself, barely saved by an all-too-brief voice appearance from Christopher Lee.<br/><br/>This shouldn't be entirely to Burton's discredit, however. Here, like on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one sees Burton still has some skills brought over from his days as an animator from Disney. Something is just missing after a while, though, a general focus of the effects assisting the story, of which the story is already kind of generic (some have compared to Narnia, though I saw more Lord of the Rings). After a while it's like Burton seems to be more interested in the little things, the garnishes that he lays about in his auteur fashion, leaving the big effects and ""sets"" to his crew. One of these garnishes is Helena Bonham Carter, wife and sort-of muse for his past several films. She just keeps getting better in his work, following Sweeney Todd, and here as the Red Queen she's reason enough to at least sneak in to see her scenes, as her giant head on a small body is ferocious and subtle and beet-red screaming. It's hilarious and intense a performance you'll see this week.<br/><br/>Others who pop on screen are more or less lucky based on their skills. Of course Johnny Depp- playing a Mad Hatter who obviously gets more screen-time because of the star status of Depp, or just how much Burton loves looking at him- can play crazy well, as he does here, but it also gets a little boring after a while, punctuated by an out-of-left-field moment (yes, an out-of-left-field moment in an Alice movie) when he breakdances at the end, which has been alluded to but not as WTF as that! Alan Rickman, Crispin Glover, and Stephen Rea round out the cast as other notables, though their screen time is all too brief, left to their own devices they can only do so much as a caterpillar, one-eyed Red-Queen lackey, and Cheshire Cat respectively. They're just overwhelmed, ultimately, by the special effects.<br/><br/>So why the high rating with these problems, not to mention a less than stellar girl playing Alice (Mia Wasikowska is a pretty face, but can't do much with such a thin character)? Because as a Tim Burton movie, flaws and all, it's still amazing to look at and sometimes just too weird to put off as a total mess. It's definitely more in league with something like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory than with Burton's best or his worst: it's an intense curio, made as a 'family film' but with such dark corners and outrageous beats that will throw off even the most hardcore surrealist. It's a flight of fancy that owes as much to its hit-or-miss Disney studio name than its iconoclast director."

","I'm not going to claim to be an expert on the subject, and I do not have a choice for the best adaptation of the brilliant novels. However, and what I'm about to point out is clear to anyone who has seen some of this, I'm reporting it for anyone who hasn't, or who may think that it is a nasty rumor... this, in fact, is not Alice in Wonderland. No, really. It is a sort of sequel, a bit of ""return to"" fiction. Well, not all of those are without their merit. But this one... for one thing, was anyone jonesing for any such thing? So this is more like a regular fantasy movie, and in that regard, it simply does not begin to hold a candle to even the lesser of its competitors. Is it being overly critical to expect a film of a little less than two hours to be epic? Of course not! This has about the running time of The Neverending Story, a timeless classic in the same genre. The plot itself is reasonable, if flawed. And the fact that this has one... Tim wanted to change that for this one, from the other versions. Here's the thing... it isn't meant to. Part of the greatness of the beloved tale *is* this liberation from coherence and logic, and it was there on the pages. Go look, I'll wait. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The beings lack the majority of the charm, and a lot of the amazement is sucked out of the environments. For all the beautifully done FX, the designs vary in quality, and the creatures don't quite make the impact or have the physical weight to them that they should(it has been done better elsewhere, where it was also CGI). This would have to be one of the least Burton-like and most bland of his pictures yet; we know you're above this level, what happened? Not since Planet of the Apes(and these two may be all the examples of it) has something like that been the case. It isn't an empty production; there is the odd detail that *really* works, the occasional chuckle, and the perfectly chosen cast certainly does shine. On the whole, though, this is excessively straightforward and sanitized, something that you probably wouldn't have dreamt of saying(or hearing) about anything by the man responsible for Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice before this. Finally, let me say that Depp should perhaps have picked one way of delivering his performance and stuck with it. This is not that funny, or wondrous, or visually stimulating(gorgeous images with little to no emotion behind them leave audiences cold). There is a lot of potentially frightening and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to those who wish to take in anything related to the original. 5/10"

I actually DO know why it has been getting rather poor reviews. The reason is because people who grew up knowing the original Alice in Wonderland story were disappointed that this movie was not the same exact rehashing of that classic tale. I do not understand why many people are unsatisfied with an alternative look at an old story. Why would anyone want to see the same movie over, and over again anyways?<br/><br/>The characters in this movie were really well done. I was not expecting to care much for Depp's Mad Hatter going into the film, but I found myself really liking what he did with the character. I also think that Carter did a nice job with all of the obnoxious yelling, a very important characteristic for the Red Queen to posses. <br/><br/>With all of the unique characters (many of which seem to lack common sense), I was a bit worried that the plot would not be there. However I found myself pleasantly surprised that it was a lot better than I thought it would be. The story had a kind of a ""Chronicles of Narnia"" feel to it. All characters were gearing up for a big battle at the end of Alice's journey.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the look of the film was incredible. There was really almost too much to take in with just one viewing. Even little things, like when I noticed the birds holding up the chandelier in the Red Queen's quarters, really added to the movie. <br/><br/>With unique characters, amazing visuals, and a solid plot, I thought that this movie is a great one to watch."

","I like this movie, do not be discouraged by the purist who will claim, that Alice in Wonderland is far cry from its predecessors, or that Tim Burton sold out, and manufactured a gimmick as opposed to a great movie. it works, end of story.<br/><br/>The storyline does detract slightly from its original, but this story was never pitched at the sort of crowd, that a 7 year old could keep entertained. This rendition of Alice in Wonderland is precisely what the trippy wonderland would look like, if conceptualised by an adult. It is dark strange, and hostile, but fascinating and fun all at once.<br/><br/>i am going to out on the limb here and say, it will be difficult for some to successfully appreciate all the flavors in this movie, as it it a interesting mix, please please remember its origin.<br/><br/>The characters work, the Mad Hatter was very well portrayed, the white and red Queen were also very equal to the challenge, and the costumes complemented the scenery and the characters. I especially liked Cheshire. So ""Chapeau"" to Johnny Deep, Anne Hathaway and the unforgettable Helena Bonham Parker <br/><br/>The movie kept me well interested all the way through. I do have one criticism though, and it is that Alice's character does seem a little shallow, but it is important to remember that she is a passenger on existing bus, and more of a pawn on the chess board, and that works, this story shows us the depths of Wonderland, like they could not be portrayed before, it is very good, spend the cash.<br/><br/>When all is considered, I really like it, and will see it again."
"rock90-683-757379","9","2","5","12 March 2010"," See it twice.
","And the second time you see it, don't see it in 3D. It's more enjoyable and less ""visibly dark"" in 2D. First of all I don't think the reviewers are giving enough credit to how amazing the visuals are. Virtually the entire film was green screened and it never feels like that. You as an audience member believe they are in this world and these creatures are next to them interacting.<br/><br/>Also, seeing it the second time around you get much more of a sense of the theme, especially with the parallel of when Alice runs from her proposal and later when Alice runs from being appointed ""the champion"".<br/><br/>And really the people who compare it to Narnia and Lord of the Rings are overlooking the fact that though basic structures of the story seem similar, there are elements such as Alice's growing and shrinking throughout, and the bizarre animals, and the Queen's humongous head that really live in that world of Wonderland (or Underland rather) and couldn't adapt to a Narnia or a Tolkien book.<br/><br/>Acting wise it's all fine. As many other reviews have said, Helena Bonham Carter steals the show, and I think to a certain extent Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat does too. Mia Wasikowska's take on Alice I found excellent. She's not bland, but makes subtle acting choices and I find it much more powerful. Linda Woolverton's script however depicting Alice as certain she's in a dream for more than half the movie makes Alice come off a bit like she's less engaged and in awe of the world around her. A flaw that lies solely in the script.<br/><br/>Overall thoroughly enjoyable, imaginative, and a fresh new take on such a familiar classic."
"AwesometownReviews","3","2","5","11 March 2010"," Alice's Not So Wonderous Return to Wonderland...
","Everyone has been saying that this is the single most divisive film of the year. I've spoken with two people since viewing the film. Person number one loved it, saying that he considered it ""far better than Avatar"", while person number two not only despised the film, but has decided that he may be losing faith in Tim Burton as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I can bring myself to say that I 'hated' Alice in Wonderland, but I sure didn't like it, any of it, at all. Also, I tend to agree with person number two about Tim Burton. The last film that he made that I love was 1994's Ed Wood. God I love that movie. 1996's Mars Attacks was enjoyable, in a fun, pulpy kind of awesomeness, and I really enjoyed, but didn't love, 2003's Big Fish. Everything else directed by Burton in the past decade and change has ranged from the passable, Sweeney Todd, to the terrible, Planet of the Apes. This film ranks up there (or down there) with his worst.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why Burton decided to make a Hook-like sequel to the original story, instead of just remaking the original. While I have no problem with the fact that this film is a sequel, what I do have a problem with is the fact that this sequel lacks any of the charm, wit and fun that the original had in spades (HAHAHA a card pun in an Alice in Wonderland Review!) The story here is paper thin. Onion paper thin. It makes the story in Avatar seem deep by comparison. Here's the ""story"": Alice, Mia Wasikowska, is now a young woman. She has no recollection of her childhood adventures in Wonderland, but every night, much to her confusion, she dreams the same dream about disappearing cats and talking caterpillars. At the beginning of the film she is at an aristocratic society function where she learns that a very rich, yet awkward and ugly, nobleman plans to ask for her hand in marriage. Alice doesn't want to marry him, and she follows a white rabbit in a top-coat down a rabbit hole to Wonderland. Once in Wonderland we learn that the Red Queen has assumed control, and is chopping everyone's head off like crazy. There's a magical piece of parchment that predicts that Alice is destined to kill the queen's pet Jabberwocky (some big dragon that breathes lightning) on some holiday, and freedom will be brought to the land. The rest of the movie is Alice running around telling everyone that she's dreaming as we're taken on a veritable ""who's who"" of Wonderland as Alice is reunited with all her old friends and enemies.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is annoying as the Mad Hatter. I've hated his appearance in this film since the very first production stills were released almost a year ago, but I was holding on to a little bit of hope that he might be able to do something fun and interesting with the character. He doesn't. He never comes across as particularly 'mad'. Aside from speaking in two distinctive accents, one of them Scottish, and doing some bizarre dance at the end of the film, he doesn't really do anything crazy. Oh, every once in a while he gets pretty excited about what he's talking about and someone has to cut him off. Pretty crazy! Did you know that Anne Hathaway is in this film? I had no idea until she showed up halfway through dressed as the White Queen. Why is Anne Hathaway in this movie? There's not a moment when she's on screen that you won't be looking at her thinking, ""Hey! You're Anne Hathaway. Why are you here?"" That's because every moment she's on screen there is an expression on her face that says, ""Hey! I'm Anne Hathaway. Why am I here?"" It's really just one of those bizarre WTF casting decisions...<br/><br/>I really don't like the look of anything in this movie, aside from Tweele Dumb and Tweedle Dee and Helena Bonham Carter's giant-headed Red Queen. If there was one thing in this film that I 'almost' enjoyed, it was Bonham Carter, but after she said, ""Off with his head!"" for the twelfth time, I began to find her pretty annoying.<br/><br/>There's a moment near the end of the film where Alice finally admits to herself that she isn't dreaming, and is ready to accept her destiny and slay the Jabberwocky. It's supposed to be a grand, epic moment, but packs all the emotional punch of an episode of Garfield and Friends.<br/><br/>Why is Alice the only one who can wield the magical sword and slay the Jabberwocky? Why is Alice warned that the sword must not be used for anything aside from this single purpose? Why does Johnny Depp always need to wear white face paint in Tim Burton's movies? These are just a few of the questions that this film raises but fails to answer.<br/><br/>Go read Lewis Carroll's novel, or watch the Disney animated film. Or, go see this movie, since it appears that (somehow) approximately fifty percent of the people who see it have an opinion that completely opposes mine.<br/><br/>2 / 5 on the Awesome Meter"

","I am slightly in shock as to how disappointing this film turned out to be - with Tim Burton you expect to see something quirky, unusual, funny and memorable. That this film fails on all levels is a real disappointment. The actress who plays Alice may be a pretty girl but she is totally uncharismatic in this film, her character does not develop throughout the film, she is just as bland as at the beginning. The storyline is completely unengaging and to end with a banal fight scene is a real cop-out. Where was the surrealism?..people saying ""oh we are mad we are"" or words to that effect does not really do it justice. Depp's turn as the Mad Hatter is again nothing special and his dancing at the end is a cringingly bad scene, I was embarrassed.... At the end of the film the whole cinema quietly sloped away from a mess of a film that seemed to borrow from LOTR, Narnia, Avatar amongst others and became so formulaic as to be the magnolia of films...really very poor."

","I took my children to watch this film and we all loved it. The characters were good and the action was amazing. I could not find fault with the film. The story is based on Alice already having her adventure in Wonderland when she was a child and she returns to Wonderland as an adult but with no recollection of being in Wonderland until the end of the film. She believes herself to be the ""wrong Alice."" The special effects are good and the action is non-stop after Alice enters Wonderland.<br/><br/>I was undecided about seeing the film after reading the reviews on here, but I am glad that I didn't. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it is released. This is one of Disney's finest. It is much better than some of the rubbish being released like Monsters Versus Aliens.

"inkblot11","8","2","5","10 March 2010"," Some kind of Wonderful, is Burton's Alice, being very imaginative and vibrant; but, purists, take heed! This is a new chapter!
","Alice (Mia Wasikowska) has been having strange dreams since childhood. Only her father could comfort her when she got scared during the night. Now, her papa has passed away and she is a 19 year old woman in the early 20th century. Her mother (Miranda Richardson) shuffles her to a party where, unknown to Alice, she will receive a proposal of marriage from a stuffy, carrot-topped Lord of England. But, at the critical moment, with the man on his knees, Alice spots a white rabbit and says she needs ""a moment"" to think. Following the rabbit, she tumbles down a hole in the ground, where she ends up in Wonderland. She may have been there before! As she drinks and eats the magic juices and cakes to make her larger and smaller, she eventually gets through a locked chamber and into the forest. Immediately, she is pursued by the Bandersnatch, a striped beast, who is doing the bidding of the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). But, the dormouse saves Alice by snatching away one of the beast's eyes. Arriving at a safe place, Alice meets The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Cheshire Cat, the blue caterpillar, Absolam (Alan Rickman) and the rest. At the hatter's tea party, Alice learns the current happenings in the land. The Red Queen is in total power, having defeated her younger sister, the lovely White Queen (Anne Hathaway). Aiding the royal is the black-hearted knave (Crispin Glover). They can take prisoners or utter ""off with their heads"" whenever they wish. Indeed, the Red Queen has recently taken TweedleDee and TweedleDum as her own little ""fat boys"", to amuse her when she wishes. Alice also learns a secret. That is, she, Alice, has the power to defeat Big Red in the near future. But, it would require an enormous act of bravery. Will she, Alice, be willing to risk everything for the kingdom? Dear purists, don't fret over this new version with endless criticisms. The film is the ""next"" chapter in the life of Alice, as she herself has flashbacks of her previous trip to Wonderland as a little girl Now, ten years later, she has returned, in Burton's vision. And, what a vibrant, imaginative vision it is, for the director's Wonderland is a joy to behold, visually speaking. There is, in fact, so much detail to the settings that one would have to see the film two or three times to appreciate everything presented. Apart from the setting, the cast is truly wonderful, too. Depp, alas, has less memorable lines and scenes but, that is not his fault. In any case, he definitely has his moments and works them to highest advantage. On the other hand, Bonham Carter MAKES the film, for her Red Queen is very comical and her appearance, with a huge, lightbulb shaped head, is a scream. All of the others do fine work, too, especially Timothy Spall as Bayard, the hound. Wasikowska is effective in her first big role but is by no means a polished performer yet. As for the movie's other assets, the costumes, art direction and camera-work, they are of the highest quality. The one item that did not please me was the ""playing card"" attendants to the Red Queen should not have been red! They could have had red hats and sashes but the way they are, it is difficult to tell what they are. Sorry, that's really small potatoes. IF there is anything lacking at all, it is these things. One, there is not enough humor, in my opinion, I wish there had been more. And, two, the film does ""borrow"" some elements of the Wizard of Oz and, believe it or not, Titanic. However, these are no reasons to miss this flick at all. In truth, Burton's Alice in Wonderland is some kind of wonderful and its reputation will grow in the coming years."
"jmh259","7","2","5","9 March 2010"," Definitely a Film worth seeing
","I wanted to start off by saying that the visuals were great. The 3D definitely could have been better, but I still enjoyed it and am glad that I saw it in 3D rather than regular. I think Depp did a great job creating the Mad Hatter Character. As for the plot, many people claimed that it was too boring and simple. Personally I had no issue with the plot as it kept me entertained throughout the entire movie. Alice wasn't acting surprised in the new world because she believed she was dreaming and creating it all in her mind. And when this plot is compared to the original 1951 version it was certainly an improvement. For those who believe it was too simple just look back at the original. The whole plot was that she wandered off after a white rabbit and got lost before running down a tunnel of smoke and escaping all her problems by telling herself to wake up. At least this movie was moving towards a climax and resolution in where she realizes that Wonderland was a parallel to the current issue she was facing in the real world and by overcoming the dangers in wonderland she also found the answer she was looking for. Burton and Depp are still doing a great job, people just have way too high expectations for them these days. Overall great and worth seeing in theaters."
"aharmas","5","2","5","7 March 2010"," Interesting, Intriguing, and Imperfect
","When you hear that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are going to experiment and collaborate in a project based on one of the most mind bending books of all time, you know there are possibilities for this become a feast for the senses, and it's extremely disappointing when the magic is not strong or satisfying enough.<br/><br/>Much of the problematic situation occurs with the dim 3-D experience where colors that were enticing and wild are muted. In complete contrast to some of the beautiful displays in ""Avatar"", this wild ride doesn't even get to shine or boast a palette that would make the whole event more bewitching.<br/><br/>In addition to the color scheme, Burton's reins are not quite in control. The character of Alice appears befuddled (as it should be), but the myriad of supporting denizens of Wonderland can't seem to go beyond just being ""strange"". Much of problem originates in the fact that they have very little to work with. The situation is tense in the real world, but not very interesting in Wonderland where rivalries are mostly boring exchanges of plain good old boring remarks to crazy power hungry threats to chop off body parts.<br/><br/>Amazingly enough the younger members of the audience seemed pleased, and that might be the producers' original intent, but thinking parties might be not be satisfied with this bland mix. Pixar seems to pull the trick, I just wonder how crazy the experience would have been in the right hands. Maybe, there is the possibility the sequel might be saved?"
"georgioskarpouzas","7","2","5","6 March 2010"," A competent adaptation
","I have to admit that I went to watched this movie with mixed feelings, since it's critical reception in my country has been mixed and lukewarm and I suppose the critics would have been more vociferous, had they not being restrained by the glamour and respect the name of Tim Bourton commands.<br/><br/>I personally found the movie good enough, given the fact that it visualized an allegorical fairy-tale, something like Animal Farm, therefore it's scope is by definition restricted, since no allegory however brilliant can cope with the richness and ambiguity of real life itself.<br/><br/>Having become conciliated with watching a fairy-tale, I enjoyed it, not so much about it's overall political or social sophistication but because it contained impressive graphic work and singular, if flat, characters.<br/><br/>First of all I learned about the dragon Juberwakee, whom I thought a product of Terry Gilliam's cinematic imagination. The dragon had the same form that it had in Gilliam's movie, only it was frightening while in the Gilliam movie it was pathetic.<br/><br/>The Chesire cat had an aptly mischievous look, similar though to that of Woopie Goldberg in a previous adaptation of the fable. I recognized the voice of Alan Rickman in Abessalom, familiar from Harry Potter's Professor Snape. Mat Lucas, of Poppetown fame was the voice of the mutually contradictory twins.<br/><br/>I liked Johny Depp as the Mad Hatter, although he must be an exception in cinematic history, since he became a huge star portraying quizzical characters and thus refuting Dr.Johnson's dictum that ""nothing odd would last"".In this movie he stays loyal to the quizzical tradition he has created.<br/><br/>Ann Hathaway is the good White Queen rather feeble compared with her sister the evil Red Queen, played by Helena Bonam Carter. Both are flat characters, although the mannerisms of evil are rather more memorable but I think is a generic problem since goodness like happiness does not create such a spectacular impression as their opposites.<br/><br/>The sidekick, paramour and protégé of the Red Queen, was evil as well as slimy and even a traitor to his own benefactress. I think his morals were the worse of all the personages of the movie and that was vividly portrayed in the acting.<br/><br/>The graphic work was competent and it even made the card-soldiers of the Red Queen look quite menacing.Also very able was the presentation of her obsequious and sycophantic courtiers.<br/><br/>A peculiar problem that I had was with the language and I think it applies to any viewer whose language is not English. The word-plays and innuendos in English were mostly lost in the translation-subtitles and I could not understand their content in English unless I saw them written in English, which was not the case.<br/><br/>The characters of the people which referred to the real world, were Victorian ladies and gentlemen, rather stuffy or even ridiculous, the suitor of Alice, for example.<br/><br/>What I found curious is that the moral that Alice extracted from her adventure in Wonderland, was not a lesson in goodness or meekness, in the lines of her patroness there, the White Queen, but a vindication of Victorian commercial imperialism.In the final scene of the movie, Alice back in the real world, takes her place as the heir of her father, who was an enterprising merchant on the grand scale, deciding to continue and further his venture of overseas trade, renewing the partnership with a partner of her late father. We see scenes of goods travelling in far away eastern lands and Alice furthers her father's venture, proposing trading relations even as far as China, an idea with perhaps modern connotations in mind. I admit that I had never considered the Alice novels as moral justifications of the ""white man's burden"", or as educational tools for those destined to inherit and further imperial responsibilities.<br/><br/>In general I found the movie not bad at all and less ""dark"" than some Lord of the Rings, Star Wars or late Harry Potter movies-if we stay within the domains of books for the young that were adapted to films."

","Just watched this movie with my movie theatre working friend this afternoon. This Tim Burton version of the famous Alice books by Lewis Caroll is quite visually stunning, especially in 3-D, but that should come as no surprise to anyone who's seen any of Burton's movies. As the title character, Mia Wasikowska is luminous in her presence and provides an appealing spunk to her characterization. Of course, regular players Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter provide their own unique charms as The Mad Hatter and The Red Queen, respectively, while Anne Hathaway is perfectly ingratiating as The White Queen. Another Burton regular, Danny Elfman, provides another resonating complimentary music score. Oh, and I was wonderfully surprised to find out that Stayne-The Knave of Hearts was played by Crispin Glover who I mainly remember as Marty McFly's father in the first Back to the Future. In other words, I was quite enchanted by this latest version of Alice in Wonderland. So on that note, that's a recommendation..."
"sinncross","6","3","11","5 March 2010"," Late for tea...
","While attending a party on a Victorian estate, Alice Kingsley (Mia Wasikowska) becomes interested in an apparent white rabbit she sees. Upon following the rabbit, Alice finds herself caught up in a magical world unlike reality known as Underland. Alice believes she is dreaming, but with the help of the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) she learns that she is needed to help stop the Red Queen's (Helena Bonham Carter) reign of terror.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland can, on first appearance, seem like a remake of the original story on which it is based. But as the story develops it becomes clear that it is a sequel of sorts following the life of Alice now that she is older. The narrative is divided into two parts, namely the Victorian setting which opens and closes the film and that of Underland of which the film is mostly comprised. There is a very interesting point of departure in how both worlds become important for Alice's development as a woman in Victorian London but the relation is just poorly implemented on Tim Burton's part. Though, it must be said that Alice in Wonderland is merely Lewis Carroll's original story just with a Goth coating and with less thematic depth: in fact it is perhaps one of Burton's least original and weakest in terms of narrative fecundity but the feminist undertones are noticeable. It should be noted that character development is perhaps the weakest point of the film with no character really showing off any tangible development whatsoever. It could be argued that Alice does grow as a character and this is what allows her to make the decisions she does in the end, but these actions only portray her original feminist ideas, rather than any self-reflection on her part of the society in which she lives. In a rather bizarre twist, the seriousness of the final act of Underland is finished by a rather unappealing, albeit slightly funny, act which hurts the more film then it helps. Humour becomes a largely hit-and-miss affair with some being plainly unfunny, though the Red Queen allows for some good laughs.<br/><br/>That said, the acting is a mixed bag with some actors getting their respective character spot on and others seemingly unable to do so. Alice and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) are sadly examples of the latter which is disappointing since it is with these two that the film carries itself. Wasikowska may be able to look the part but she is far too subdued in her emotion and tone range for the feminist Alice, while Hathaway gets herself wrapped up in poor overacting. On the reverse there are some great performances to be seen with the Red Queen and the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry). Both are wonderful performances and easily help elevate the film's overall quality as Carter shouts out the most hilarious line of the film over and over without any dulling effect as Fry oozes a charisma that is sure to put a smile on your face. Lastly, there is Depp as the Mad Hatter: Depp comes across as playing his usual eccentric character which feels a little tiresome at times these days. On top of this his character's vocal change shows hint of his Jack Sparrow character which breaks the illusion of the film. Nevertheless, Depp does showcase why he is a talented actor but he never really does anything exciting to make the Mad Hatter that much different to previous roles.<br/><br/>On the opposite side of the spectrum the physical nature of the film looks and sounds delightful with some good use of computer animation and music. It is never on par with the likes of Avatar in terms of lushness, but there is a distinct cartoon feel which resonates well for the film: just as great as Fry is as the Cheshire Cat, so is the physical manifestation of the character an appealing sight. There are however some shortcomings such as wonky movement animation on the rare character and some major texturing issues resulting in some average looking character models. The added 3D elements in the 3D version of the film lack life and are unimaginatively used for the sole purpose of having the film released at 3D cinemas.<br/><br/>The film contains no sex, nudity or language. Violence is in small dose with some sword fighting which results in a creature having its eye taken out and another losing its head but it is far from being termed 'violent'.<br/><br/>'Wonderful' would be far too much praise for Burton's adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic story. Like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory before, Alice in Wonderland shows why Burton's version of an existing story is not always a good one. The narrative lacks depth with feminist dealings being the only core concern; character development is unheard of; and the overall acting ensemble do not do the overall cast justice. That said the computer animation serves the film's source material adequately enough; the musical score is worth noting and the film offers a potentially fun experience: it just lacks the wonder it so desperately needs."

","Oh boy did I hate this movie. It's a disastrous, arrogant mess and waste of everyone's time, whose budget could have fed the starving children of several small impoverished nations for a year. Absolutely everything about it is wrong. The plot less screenplay is a hash of preening ain't I clever? Cliff's Notes references to the original materials, a travesty of Carroll and an insult to anyone who appreciates his work. The half-baked references to Wonderland and Underland and Frabjous Day and the Jabberwocky and all that are embarrassingly lame. By the time it all devolved into just another idiotic fight scene -- followed by an appalling break-dance scene! -- I was shouting at the screen. The girl who plays Alice is very pretty, but a dull, monotone, non-acting cipher about whom it is impossible to care. The stars surrounding her try their best, but except for Ann Hathaway in a light, deft humorously turn, they all fail. The billion dollars' worth of 3D CGI mostly looks awful -- dark, jumbled, ugly. And, at this point in Burton's career, really old hat. We've seen all this a dozen times before, going back as far as Beetlejuice. It's not Wonderland, it's just another sojourn in Burtonland. The whole exercise is a lugubrious, leaden, foolish, ill-conceived and exhausting slog. I left it as angry and disappointed as I did Terry Gilliam's similarly half-baked and overwrought mess Dr. Parnassus. I'm still a fan of Burton's earlier films, but the last decade or so he's made one wrong turn after another."
"TheLittleSongbird","6","2","6","7 June 2010"," Beautiful visuals, with some good performances- but there is something missing...
","I personally really love the book, I enjoy the characters and their situations, even if the story is rather oddball and not easy to adapt. In terms of adaptations, the animated film is still my favourite, mainly because I have a lot of nostalgia for it. Coming from somebody who likes Tim Burton's work, I enjoyed this re-imagining of Alice in Wonderland, but I also felt it could have been better. Is it Burton's worst? I think not, that dishonour goes to Planet of the Apes, and I also preferred this over Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. But is it his best? No, not by a long shot- Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Beetle Juice are my personal favourites, while Batman(and its sequel, one of the better sequels to anything I've seen actually), Big Fish and Sleepy Hollow are also brilliant. I haven't seen Sweeney Todd all the way through, I am just wondering whether Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are better than George Hearn and Angela Lansbury in the roles of Sweeney and Mrs Lovett. Anyway that's another story.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland does have a lot of virtues as well as faults. Starting with the virtues, the visuals are absolutely fantastic. The costumes, especially in the first twenty minutes are absolutely exquisite, the scenery is dark, colourful, lush and wondrous and the special effects and cinematography are well above average too, especially with the imposing-looking Jabberwocky. There have been some comments that didn't like Danny Elfman's score, while his score for Edward Scissorhands is better, I liked his score here, it was fantasy-like and atmospheric and better than his score for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, where the Oompah Loompah song especially really annoyed me. It also moves quite quickly, and I liked the references to the original story.<br/><br/>Technicalities aside, there were also some very good performances, as well as some disappointments. Alan Rickman was deliciously suave and dour as the Blue Caterpillar, even if his role was somewhat brief, while Stephen Fry was absolute purr-fection as the Cheshire Cat, with a cheeky smile and bagging some of the best lines such as ""I never get involved in politics"". Matt Lucas was funny as TweedleDum and TweedleDee, and Michael Sheen was very nice as the White Rabbit. The ever-exceptional Christopher Lee was appropriately menacing as the Jabberwocky, while Helena Bonham Carter is suitably shrill as the Red Queen, though expect the constant repetition of ""Off with his/her head"" every now and again. A big surprise though was Anne Hathaway, not only did she look stunning but she brought just the right touch of the sweet and the sinister, and Barbara Windsor as the Dormouse was an inspired casting choice.<br/><br/>However, there were one or two performances that weren't quite there. I am sorry to say I found Mia Wasikowska bland as Alice, she looks beautiful but she just didn't quite convince. Then again in her defence, Alice I have found one of the least interesting characters in the story, I always found myself attached to the Cheshire Cat, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, The Mock Turtle and the White Knight myself. Speaking of the Mad Hatter, I was a little disappointed with Johnny Depp's performance. I liked the make-up and everything, but compared with his more poignant and more human characters(ie. Edward) I felt Depp overdid it with the accent and the eccentricity of the character. Crispin Glover I wasn't so sure about either, I can't put my finger on why, maybe it was because Stayne is a very slimy character and perhaps the sliminess was overdone but maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>Onto the cons of Alice in Wonderland, the story structure I found disjointed. It does start off really well, but it does meander, and then there are scenes that don't quite work especially the Futterwacken Dance, which was out of place and had the WTF? factor about it. Plus while I appreciated the references, the theme of madness is only briefly touched upon, and that was disappointing. While there are some nice funny lines here and there, the writing is clumsy and inconsistent in general, Alice's dialogue in particular is clumsily written at times and woodenly delivered, not to mention a part before the flashback with the Hatter, White Queen and Jabberwocky Hatter's rant sounded like that of a pirate. Burton's direction here isn't as innovative as it is in his earlier films, and some of the characters are devoid of depth and heart, some of them just come and go like a series of vignettes. I think these flaws could have been avoided with a longer film length by twenty minutes or so.<br/><br/>Overall, it is worth watching by all means, but it just lacks something. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"jboothmillard","5","2","6","14 March 2010"," Alice in Wonderland
","Disney had already made an animated adaptation in 1951 of the classic literary nonsense book by Lewis Carroll, when it was announced director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street) was creating a new Disney live-action version, I was most excited. Basically nineteen-year-old Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) gets an unwanted marriage proposal from Hamish Ascot (Leo Bill), but she is distracted when she sees a mysterious White Rabbit (Michael Sheen) wearing a waistcoat with a pocket watch, following him she accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole. After shrinking and growing her through a locked door, she emerges in a forest in the world of ""Underworld"", greeted by the White Rabbit, the Dormouse (Dame Barbara Windsor), the Dodo Bird (Michael Gough), the Talking Flowers (Imelda Staunton), and Tweedledee and Tweedledum (both Matt Lucas). They argue over her identity as ""the right Alice"" who must slay the Jabberwocky (Sir Christopher Lee), the feared creature of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), and restore the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) to power, as foretold by Absolem the Caterpillar (Alan Rickman). They are ambushed by the Bandersnatch and a group of playing-card soldiers, led by the Stayne Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover), Tweedledum and Tweedledee are captured by the Red Queen's Jubjub bird, the Knave informs the Red Queen of Alice's presence, soldiers and Bayard the Bloodhound (Timothy Spall) are ordered to find her. Alice has been guided by the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) to the Mad Hatter (Golden Globe nominated Johnny Depp) and the March Hare (Paul Whitehouse), they also debate she is ""the real Alice"", before is forced to escape another ambush, she is found by Bayard, but Alice insists on helping the Hatter who is captured. Alice does to the palace, the Red Queen does not recognise her, she assumes she is a guest, there Alice learns of the Vorpal Sword, the only weapon capable of killing the Jabberwocky, she is eventually able to obtain it and escapes on the Bandersnatch who she befriends, she delivers the sword to the White Queen. The Cheshire Cat saves the Mad Hatter from execution, he calls for a rebellion against the Red Queen, the Jubjub bird attacks, but the resistance flee to the White Queen's castle, there Alice finally remembers being in Underland when she was a child, she called it ""Wonderland"", former caterpillar Absolem advises her to fight the Jabberwocky. On the appointed day, the armies of the Red and White Queens gather on a chessboard-like battlefield, Alice has gathered courage to fight the Jabberwocky, they fight among the ruins, until she finally jumps on the spiral staircase onto the Jabberwocky's neck and beheads it. The battle ends, the White Queen sends the Red Queen and the Knave into exile, the Mad Hatter celebrate with a dance, and the White Queen gives Alice a vial of the Jabberwocky's purple blood, its power will bring her whatever she wishes. In the end Alice decides to return to everyday world, back in England she becomes apprentice to Lord Ascot (Tim Pigott-Smith) with the idea of establishing oceanic trade routes to Hong Kong, she sets sail on her father's ship the Wonder, and Alice recognises a light- blue butterfly passing as Absolem. Also starring The Lord of the Rings' Marton Csokas as Charles Kingsleigh, Birdman's Lindsay Duncan as Helen Kingsleigh, Jim Carter as the Executioner, Vicious's Frances de la Tour as Aunt Imogene, Jemma Powell as Margaret Kingsleigh and Geraldine James as Lady Ascot. Depp with his colourful makeup and bonkers personality, and Carter as the villain with her big head and fiery temper are the best characters, among the many other weird and wonderful creatures, and Wasikowska is a good choice as the curious teenager finding her way in the Wonderland. The tone of the film I agree is a little wavering and uneven at times, but it is a magical journey, all the familiar characters brought together, with visionary backgrounds, all created by superb computer animation, the dark re-imagining of the stories are well done, I am glad I watched it again to get a better opinion, it is a good fantasy adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Visual Effects, it won the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Danny Elfman, Best Special Visual Effects and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Original Score. Worth watching!"
"agsconnolly","5","2","6","7 March 2010"," Not bad - but is this what Burton intended?
","Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland is essentially a sequel to the original story, featuring an older Alice revisiting the familiar characters in Wonderland and charged with saving the Mad Hatter et al from the rule of the evil Red Queen.<br/><br/>It is probably to be admired that Burton did not try to regurgitate a story that has been told so many times and instead created a new chapter. However, the execution falls somewhat short and whilst the CGI world and its inhabitants are impressive, the film seems to lack solid foundations, meaning the outcome of Alice's adventure is not particularly gripping or suitably interesting.<br/><br/>Much had been made of Johnny Depp's performance as the Mad Hatter, but in truth it is a fairly routine performance from a talented actor who spends far too much time in quirky, off-beat roles like this. Some of the voice contributions are enjoyable - Stephen Fry's Cheshire Cat springs to mind - and Mia Wasikowska is not out of place in the lead role. What lets down a lot of the incidental roles is the lack of a sharp script - several of the allocated 'comedy' parts are either underused or simply not funny enough, Paul Whitehouse's March Hare being the most clear example of the former, Barbara Windsor's Dormouse a case of the latter.<br/><br/>It must be said though, that the opening three quarters of an hour are pretty enjoyable as we meet the characters and see the outline of the plot unfold. However, somewhere around the hour mark we lose a fair bit of the obscure fun typically associated with Alice in Wonderland, and are drawn into a fairly formulaic post-Lord Of The Rings 'good vs. evil' yarn. It also becomes increasingly obvious that this is a film for children, and that Burton has sacrificed the typically darker hue of his films for this reason, as well as, sadly, much of the substance. Towards the end, the Mad Hatter character performs a CGI-enhanced dance to a cringingly modern dance beat, at which point those who wanted to give Burton the benefit of the doubt will have surrendered.<br/><br/>There's nothing particularly wrong with making a new Alice In Wonderland with a recognisable story line for children. But is this really what Tim Burton was trying to achieve? Perhaps - but it seems unlikely that something any experienced Disney film-maker could have produced is what the director was aiming for. There is also the fact that Burton stubbornly continues to use his wife, Helena Bonham-Carter, and Johnny Depp in pretty much all his films, and that - coupled with his perennial dark fantasy motif - is going to get old whichever way you slice it. The task for him now should be to find a new approach and, preferably, some new stars.<br/><br/>Alice In Wonderland is great to look at and enjoyable for the most part. But it's not a classic and should indeed mark a crossroads for Burton and Depp, from where they need to decide whether they want a new challenge or not."
"bigmack88","7","2","6","7 March 2010"," Burton delivers Burton but no real ""heart"" in his Alice in Wonderland.
","While Tim Burton can always promise his unique sense of style and aesthetic in every cinematic endeavor he undertakes, he rarely produces work that has real ""heart"". Such is the case for his version of Alice in Wonderland. Where the movie really succeeds is in it's rich costuming and set dressing as well as stellar performances by Burton's real-life wife, Helena Bonham Carter who plays the large headed Red Queen as well as Mia Wasikowska who plays Alice. The film's character design closely mimics the creepy illustrations (which are in alignment with Burton's creepy sensibility) from Lewis Carrol's original publishing of the book done by John Tenniel. I'm typically a huge Johnny Depp fan but just like his performance in the recent Charlie & the Chocolate factory, I think he missed the mark with this overcooked (<--speaking of his look) and underdone (<--speaking of his acting choices) character. Most of the other characters fell flat and Crispin Glover (Back to the Future & Beowulf) was just as creepy as he is in almost every role he's ever played. As far as special effects and CG, I suspected my recent viewing of Avatar would colored my view of this movie and I indeed found the ""Phantom Menace"" CG sets too unreal and ""video-game-like"" to suspend my belief. Also, I think that the choice to make the film 3D was more of a marketing afterthought (my assumption is based on the fact that all the 3D was done in post-production) and ironically most of it fell flat for me literally speaking. I would not recommend this movie to kids under 12 based on some of the more gruesome (although not really graphic) visuals having to do with beheading and the like. Having ripped the movie a new one, I don't hesitate to recommend adding this to your Netflix queue. There were some great scenes and moments throughout that I really did enjoy and the storyline is much closer to the original books than the original Disney cartoon was. However, don't expect the same warm fuzzy feeling that other movies under the Disney name have given audiences throughout the years. If you're a Tim Burton fan I recommend seeing it at the IMAX in 3D, otherwise I'd wait 12 weeks for the DVD release."
"Romarth","Null","2","6","6 March 2010"," Why, Tim Burton?
","If there's one filmmaker working today whose style is utterly unmistakable, it's Tim Burton. Since his debut, he's proudly and consistently upheld his many visual and metaphysical tropes with TLC. These tenets include: ostentatious design and execution of the delectably twisted and dark kind, saccharine sentimentality (with perhaps the exception of Sweeney Todd), and a dramatis personae of irascible characters both one with his darkness and yet completely unaware of it. But Burton's self-aware devotion to this Formula* has palliated his once-fresh perspective, familiarity subsequently turning odd and unconventional into a recycled bore and, thus, the complete opposite. The biggest offender of this cumbersome rehashing is the director's latest, a highly ambitious undertaking: a live-action adaptation of the Lewis Carroll classic, Alice in Wonderland.<br/><br/>We start off with the mandatory flashback to the youth of our heroine, the eponymous Alice. Her ambitious father (Marton Csokas) gallantly interrupts an important meeting to tend to his post-nightmare daughter. She proceeds to describe her bad dream, foreshadowing her coming adventures in Wonderland, and questions her own sanity. Her father replies (and I'm paraphrasing): ""Yes, you're mad. But the best people are."" It's a nice sentiment, and one that fittingly pertains with the status quo evident here. It's almost distraction enough from the hilariously bad performance given by the ever-mugging Csokas. It's a brief turn, which makes the efficacy of his awfulness all the more surprising.<br/><br/>Years later, Alice (listless newcomer Mia Wasikowska) is nineteen and doomed to an arranged marriage to a complete stiff. The ensuing events are banalities sparse in consequence, necessary to increase the wonder of Wonderland by contrast, but dull nonetheless. Ironically, the title setting is surprisingly unimaginative. Burton's Wonderland is one of generic outlandishness; large, colorful flora, discolored skies of a dismal murk, and vast landscapes defined by one prominent topographical feature. The visual effects are embarrassingly unconvincing, and the 3-D does little to help; as always, the newfound cinematic dimension is merely a gimmick, a nicety, and here it once again proves that we still have quite a long way to go before the technique effects an audience viscerally. Obvious and absent the awe and immersion that it's director presence suggests and should guarantee, Wonderland's uninspired design is another victim of the extenuation of the Burton Formula, and the movie's disappointing lack of scope and half-realization.<br/><br/>Tonally, Alice in Wonderland is dead. It's neither comedic nor dramatic, due to an absence of intentional humor and urgency, respectively, and with the pacing of a snail, this renders the whole experience quite drab. Now, I'm sure the acidic eccentricities of Carroll and Burton sounds a treat, yes? Sadly, Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton only inherit the concept and characters of Carroll's legendarium, opting instead to incorporate their own story. What follows is a predictable hybrid of the established Wonderland scribes, absent the warmth and wit. Alice arrives in the mystical world, her ""destiny"" (and the movie's climax) is hastily affirmed, and thus everything beforehand feels like filler. Impending peril is intended to grip the story (what with the omnipresent tyranny of Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen), but last-minute and inconceivable resolutions whenever danger arises dissipates the drama.<br/><br/>The cast lend some help in the way of salvaging things. Hathaway is underused, but nails the delicate-nature of the White Queen. There's also an abundance of British character actors at the movie's disposal. Like Harry Potter, it's a roll-call of workaday thespians: Stephen Fry (Cheshire Cat, actually acting, not just reading lines), Michael Sheen (White Rabbit, his voice unrecognizable, as usual), Christopher Lee (Jabberwocky, two lines of utter captivation), Timothy Spall (the Bloodhound, slowly becoming a Burton affiliate), Alan Rickman (Caterpillar, simply perfect), etc. Each could have literally phoned in their performances, but no doubt the gravity and beloved stature of Carroll's work was enough to compel faithfulness. They're what keeps proceedings afloat and only they encapsulate the spirit of the material.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the show is stolen by Helena Bonham Carter. Thrusting herself wholeheartedly into the role of the Red Queen, she's clearly having a ball here. Bonham Carter invests in the part, going far and beyond the call of duty, turning a thin antagonist into a well-honed character; the Red Queen is greedy, selfish, nefarious, but also naive, and often comes across as someone burdened with long-existing insecurities (the writing conveys this, but Bonham Carter expands upon what is merely hinted at). Her childish totalitarianism makes for a diverting and inoffensive baddie, and also serves as the main source of the movie's genuine laughs.<br/><br/>That other staple of Burton cinema, Johnny Depp, is on hands here, donning a Carrot Top wig to play one of Carroll's most immortal and recognizable creations, the Mad Hatter. On the capricious and whimsical side of the Depp spectrum instead of stoic and near-comatose, this turn is another addition to the equally-wearing output of a man dubiously revered for versatility. I don't mean to sound irreverent, as Depp is a talented actor, but it's been seven years since his last truly impressive performance, and his need to play characters of substance-less recondite is a waste of his time. Here, he's not quite teeth-grating, but he's still not exactly as fun as he could be. Like Bonham Carter, he attempts obliqueness, here by gauging the Hatter's glee on a trippy meter of eccentric and downright maniacal depending on the situation at hand. It's a minor victory for character depth, but it's a shame Depp insists on delivering a large portion of his lines in an unintelligible Scottish accent.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland is bad. In fact, I'm shocked at just how much I dislike it. I hate to condemn a movie for primarily this alone, but my biggest problem with it is that it's boring. Burton will undoubtedly benefit from immediately distancing himself from adaptations and the Formula."

"mark.waltz","4","1","2","22 March 2017"," It it live, or is it Burton-ex?
","The trouble with many of the spectaculars today is that you can't tell if the actors are real, made up to look freakish, or some cartoon with just a voice attached. Modern computer generated special effects were a novelty when they were first making these, but now it's an attraction that often seems closer to ""Ice Age"" than real live action. Subtle use of this form of special effects made many of Tim Burton's earlier works, but I had a hard time really becoming engaged in this ""Alice in Wonderland"", feeling I had fallen into the rabbit hole myself and o.d.'d on a dinosaur size order of magic mushrooms.<br/><br/>With many famous faces (obviously many of them Burton regulars), this is going to be artistically beautiful to look at, but difficult to become totally engaged with. First of all, you've got an overaged Alice (Mia Wasikowska) who seems like a college student playing dress up, a slam towards Lewis J. Carroll's conception of the lost little girl.<br/><br/>The performances of the characters of wonderland are basically extended cameos. Helena Bonham Carter tries for camp and ends up a screeching shrew whose Stewie Griffin like head I wanted to see explode. Johnny Depp, for once, seems to be just an amalgamation of every Burton character he's played, not a bad thing, but basically a performance that he basically texts in. It's nice to look at like a fancy drawing at a museum but after five minutes, it's time to move on."
"filipemanuelneto","3","1","2","12 June 2016"," The script was written in Wonderland?
","This film tells the story of Alice, a young nineteen year old girl who discovers, by chance, the entrance to a magical world called Wonderland. Directed by Tim Burton, the film has a script written by Linda Woolverton, based on the homonymous story of Lewis Carroll. The cast is led by Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway, besides the voices of Michael Sheen, Stephen Fry, Alan Rickman and other actors.<br/><br/>Most people know, even lightly, the story of ""Alice in Wonderland"". But this story supposedly takes place several years after the first trip to that place, where absurdity is the norm. And so begins Tim Burton to make rookie mistakes, unforgivable for a director with his curriculum. The script totally ignores the events of the original story, and Carroll's book seems to have been used only to copy the settings and characters. To make matters worse, there is no logic in Alice's behavior while in ""our"" world, and chase a rabbit to escape from a party where you don't want to be is poor excuse for doing so.<br/><br/>The actors shared the scene with magical creatures and had a regular performance, but uninspired, especially Mia Wasikowska, who was a poor Alice. Very warm and boring, she never shows feelings of fear, shock or surprise in a credible way. She was undoubtedly a casting error, and Burton again failed because he should have seen it and fixed it. Johnny Depp did a good job, and somehow manages to give some shine to the film. Nevertheless, he sometimes exaggerates in the antics, and I don't know if that was good for the movie. The two Queens, represented by Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter, were good in their roles, although Hathaway could be better if she had more time scene to develop her character.<br/><br/>The most interesting of this movie are the scenery, the costumes, the makeup and the visual/special effects. Its usual to find, in the films of this director, these elements highly developed and mature. Burton is very creative. But, I don't know why, a few years ago, he gives them too much importance, and that undermines the movies because he completely forgets everything else that is part of the film, like the direction and choice of actors or (especially) the writing of scripts. The excessive computerization aren't enough to make a good movie, although the name of a renowned director can sell cinematic garbage very well and income Oscars in technical categories (this movie won the statuettes for Best Art Direction, Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup). I hope that Mr. Burton, before returning to make a movie, spend some time away from computers, to detoxify himself of obsessive mania for that things."

"jenn-43-651261","8","1","2","1 August 2014"," Tim Burton wins again with Alice in Wonderland
","""Alice in Wonderland"" finds a much older Alice following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Upon landing at the bottom of the hole, Alice (Mia Wasikowska) finds herself in a strange world surrounded by strange creatures who argue about if she is the right Alice that they have been searching for. When the Red Queens guards show up, Alice's journey of trying to keep from being captured by the red guards, and wake up from a dream she believes she is in, begins. In her journey, she meets the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway). Alice is also told of a prophecy she stars in that will free the citizens of Underland, the real name for Wonderland, from the Red Queens reign by killing the Jabberwocky (Burton, 2010). The theme of the movie is an action adventure based in a fantasy world. During the entire movie, Alice is having one adventure after another in her attempts to free the Mad Hatter, find the Vorpal sword, and make it to the White Queens castle in the hopes that the White Queen can help her get back home. At the same time, Alice begins to realize who she is as an individual and the personal strength she has. She stands up for herself often and leads others with her ideas and plans.<br/><br/>The movie is fast-paced and has multiple elements from visual and sound effects to the actors chosen for the movie. Since Underland is purely fantastical, there is a lot of computer generated images (CGI). ""Avatar"" shares the same theme and is a highly successful movie. The background was created by the same person who created ""Avatar"" and that was the right choice for this movie since Tim Burton is known for movies that stretch the imagination and help the audience become immersed in the story instead of being distracted by the background. The sound effects are great. The thrashing around by the Bandersnatch when it is chasing Alice and when it is running with Alice on its back along with the ambient noises are not overwhelming; however, it adds to the reality of the story. The actors all did a great job of portraying his or her character. The audience believes that the Mad Hatter is very crazy, and Alice is a confused woman who finds her true self at the end of the movie. The only character that seemed out of place was the White Queen with her constantly ""floating"" around with her arms and nose in the air.<br/><br/>The costuming and make-up designs were spectacular in the movie. Although the Mad Hatter's make-up was odd, with his blue and purple eye shadow, it was easy to tell when he was having a good or bad moment. When he was having a good moment, his eye shadow was light blue and purple. His bad moments were highlighted by the fact that his eye shadow turned black as did the areas under his eyes, so it looked like he was an evil creature who was to be avoided at all costs. The costumes helped sell the era for the London scenes and highlighted how fantastical the world of Underland is with some of the outrageously dressed people and animals Alice encounters. Good costumes and make-up really help sell the reality of a fantasy movie since people are visual by nature.<br/><br/>The lighting of the movie was also nicely done since a lot of the movie was filmed in front of a green screen for the CGI to be added in later. The lighting fit the mood of the scene and the location that the scene was taking place in. When the Mad Hatter is walking through the woods with Alice and starts to explain how the Red Queen attacked everyone, the lighting becomes dark and ominous as the Jabberwocky attacks. In the castle, there are a lot of windows and the lighting used looks like natural sunlight through the windows. If artificial light was used, it is hard to tell in those scenes when the sun is shining.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a great movie. The theme of action adventure in a fantasy world was achievable with the help of visual and sound effects, the actors that were chosen, and the costumes and make-up that was selected for the movie. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who just wants to sit back and enjoy a good movie."

And now Tim Burton clearly concluded ""I can't work in a story that doesn't make sense, I'll bring Alice in a more solid wonderland, and with a story that is just beautiful as the first one, but that also make a good movie"" and guess what critic says ""too literal, I too literal"" GRRRR, those guys...

"zurnd","8","1","2","15 June 2013"," Twinkle, Twinkle Little Bat
","Growing up in the late 90s, early 2000s, there was one director who's work either haunted me or enchanted me. You might have heard of him, his name is Tim Burton. I loved films he worked on like James and the Giant Peach and Pee Wee's Big Adventure, for they captured a wonderful, whimsical and fantastic essence and structure. But when it came to films like The Nightmare Before Christmas and Beetlejuice, I was turned away and terrified, for I just didn't care for the macabre feeling and dark humor. Even the 1989 Batman and Batman Returns didn't suit my taste at first. It wasn't until my later years when I got into the movies and realized how brilliant they really were and how imaginative and demented the mind of Tim Burton was. Sure, some of his films were oddballs like Planet of the Apes and Mars Attacks, but Burton was a mastermind with a signature style and outlook. <br/><br/>So when it came time for him to reimagine Lewis Carroll's timeless tale of Wonderland and a little girl named Alice, I was intrigued. I saw pictures of Johnny Depp as the Hater and Helena Bonham Carter's big headed Red Queen and thought this would be an interesting experience with classic Burton humor and memorable characters. And while I'll say right off the bat that the film was interesting, it's not one of Burton's best. It's a brilliant and imaginative dream ride and you were very lucky to see it in stunning 3-D, but at times, I forgot I was even watching a Tim Burton film and instead watching an over bloated, CGI mad fest. The CGI felt a little out of place at times and some of the film's plot points became a little repetitive, like Alice eating the cake to grow and drinking the elixir to shrink. Still, the film has some elements that even rival that of the original animated Disney film and other interpretations done throughout the years. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is a stellar actor and his performance of the Mad Hater comes off as something entirely new and refreshing. He's not a tea obsessed, mad ball like the Ed Wynn version was, he's just a cheerful, optimistic and at times serious fellow that giggles at inconvenient times and gives off a creepy, yet humorous grin. I don't know about you, but every time he smiles, I give a snicker or two. Helena Bonham Carter is also amusing as the Red Queen, a cross between the Red Queen from Through the Looking Glass and the Queen of Hearts. Her quadruple sized head and overbearing voice make her intimidating and fear worthy and in my opinion, it's one of Helena's best performances in her husband's films, right up there with Mrs. Lovett and Emily from Corpse Bride. One of my favorite actors is also in this film. Count Dracula himself, Christopher Lee makes a cameo as the voice of the frightening Jabberwocky and even if he delivers just a few lines, he's a powerful force to be reckoned with. Interesting enough, Michael Gough is also in this film. Of course, he and Christopher Lee worked together in Horror of Dracula and Dr. Terror's House of Horrors. Mia Wasikowska is alright as the lead Alice, but I found myself a bit underwhelmed in some areas of her performance. Anne Hathaway is also decent as the White Queen, despite her constantly waving her hands around like a ninny. <br/><br/>The look of the film just screams Wonderland. Burton and his crew were able to capture the stylized and lavished surface of Wonderland beautifully and as I stated before, you were a lucky duck to see this in 3-D. From the inside of the Red Queen's palace to the opaque atmosphere of the White Queen's palace, this film has lots of eye candy to look at marvel upon. The designs of some of the CGI characters is also a highlight. The look of the Chesire Cat really stuck out the most for me and his charisma and quirkiness makes him my favorite character from the movie. He's also voiced by Stephen Fry. Tweedledee and Tweedledum are swell goofballs with ridiculously large heads and a hilarious way of walking about and Absolem is long, blue, slow and outspoken, much like Severus Snape from the Harry Potter films (which makes sense because he's voiced by Alan Rickman). Some of the characters that got under my skin a bit were the Red Queen's associates, you know, those characters with the long noses, huge chins and oversized bellies. I felt they added nothing to the film and a scene where their noses, chins and bellies fall out came off as a bit predictable. <br/><br/>Still, many of the character obtain a sense of dignity and determination to do what they feel is right. Alice, in the end, realizes that she was destine to slay the Jabberwocky and in the grand scheme of things, she is able to accomplish just that and save the land. But the film's major highpoint and moral is to believe in your dreams even when you don't want to believe in them. Sometimes, things you think are fake are 100% reality and that you can take control of them, but only if you, you guessed it, believe. Alice in Wonderland gets that point across flawlessly, even if the film itself is far from flawless. Then again, what film is flawless. Alice in Wonderland is a fateful adaptation of the source material and Burton's very best hit at the Carroll tale, but it's in no means his crowning jewel. Aside from a few CGI issues, acting issues, and over the top moments of ridiculousness, it's a pretty decent and fun movie and well worth a few hours of your time."

","Alice in Wonderland was never one of my favorite Disney movies growing up, and I'm not particularly fond of Tim Burton's movies either. So why did I watch this movie twice? The first time was because I was curious, and the second time was because I didn't know what I thought the first time. Overall I would now say that this movie was very well done in it's own dark, weird way. Johnny Depp did his usual fantastic job at being a likable weirdo as the mad hatter, Helena Bonham Carter was wonderful as the deeply messed up Red Queen, and Anne Hathaway (although she had a much smaller part)was amusing to watch as the sweet,peaceful White Queen. The rest of the acting was fine, but those three were definitely the ones that stole the show. The various creatures in the show looked good, and the scenery was beautiful. Despite all of these benefits however I still can't honestly say that I liked this movie. I enjoyed it, and would never go as far as to say that it is a waste of time to see, but it just isn't my kind of movie."

","Alice Kingsleigh is invited to a lavish engagement party but flees and falls down a hole into a strange dream world filled with talking animals, strange potions and crazy goings-on. It transpires she has been chosen to defeat the wicked Red Queen and her terrifying champion, the Jabberwocky ...<br/><br/>This lavish Disney reworking of Lewis Carroll's classic children's fable is great fun, visually splendid from start to finish and almost tops their classic 1951 animated version. The reason it doesn't is that, like Gavin Millar's excellent 1985 film Dreamchild, it's not a straight adaptation; instead, it's an amalgam of the two novels, bookended with a costume Victorian back story, flashbacks to the original adventure and the plot of the classic poem Jabberwocky (which appears in Through The Looking-Glass but is otherwise unrelated) mixed in. Linda Woolverton's script is pretty good though; it must be hard to take a story which is completely loopy to begin with and shape it into a coherent mainstream movie. What it does well is presenting Alice as an intelligent and free-spirited young woman in the midst of all the madness - she initially dismisses Underland as fantasy but gradually comes to respect it and love the people, and Wasikowska's performance really brings out this quality. Carroll's stories can be taken many ways - coming of age drama, drug-addled hallucinations, absurdist social satire - and Burton's style manages to encapsulate most of them well. Even better, it's just terrific to look at and listen to from start to finish. From the Red Queen's enormous head to the Mad Hatter's goofy green eyes to the Cheshire Cat's lazy grin, all the visual elements are arresting, and accompanied by a great Danny Elfman booming score, full of his trademark woodwind trickery, blatting brass and hurdy-gurdy melodies. The scale work alone (Alice is frequently either much too big or small) is breathtaking, and the big battle with the Jabberwocky (voiced by the inimitable Lee) is a grandiose and exciting highlight. All of the actors are great - I particularly like Glover as the slimy Knave of Hearts - but the voice cast steal it, especially Windsor as the not-so-sleepy Dormouse and Fry's honeydripped vanishing feline tones. Occasionally the movie comes across as a sort of Disney version of a Harry Potter film, with a few incoherent moments, and in some senses Depp has been playing The Mad Hatter in other pictures for years now, but there are plenty of great scenes and the realisation of the fantasy is first rate. Featuring outstanding visual effects throughout by Ken Ralston, this is a great spectacular fantasy of a timeless imaginative story."

","This 2010 Tim Burton piece features Mia Wasikowska as matured Alice Kingsleigh, Johnny Depp as the mad The Hatter, and Helena Bonham Carter as the evil Red Queen. Anne Hathaway plays the beautiful White Queen and Matt Lucas doubles his role as Tweedledee and Tweedledum. In this version, Alice has accidentally returned to Wonderland nearly a decade after her first visit. While she has no recollection of the place, her old friends have been anticipating her return. Alice is the only one able to slay the Red Queen's evil Jabberwockey so that the people can reclaim Wonderland and restore it to its natural beauty. Time is running out and the Queen is on a mission to protect her reign. After much danger and adventure with The Hatter as her guide, Alice eventually remembers her past in Wonderland, heroically slays the Jabberwocky, and returns the throne to the White Queen. Alice in Wonderland is a whimsical adventure about the truth of human nature and the struggle for human dignity. Burton does a good job with his use of color and lighting throughout the film to really show the viewer the ruin that Wonderland endured over time. Most of us hear the title of the film alone and automatically think about the colorful cartoon of the pleasant Wonderland so the darkness grabs our attention, disappointingly for some. The land is as pale as the characters are since the life has literally been sucked out of Wonderland with the exception of the Red Queen's kingdom. This is crucial to the theme because it shows what all she has taken from the land. It also helps Alice to overcome her fears because she's able to understand her importance just by looking at her surroundings. This is very similar to the color and lighting technique's that Burton used in his 2005 version of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, another favorite of mine that often gets the rotten tomatoes. I agree with some others that the dark twisted way that Tim Burton dramatizes the theme(s) of Alice in Wonderland may not be all the way pleasant for small children. However, the film instills a good message overall and was put together well enough for the entire family to enjoy together. Good Stuff Burton."
"wen77","3","1","2","1 September 2012"," A misery in Hollywoodland
","Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this. I was genuinely excited. I try to temper my excitement lately, because most of the time it is met with disappointment. And here yet again...<br/><br/>The visuals are precisely what you expect of Tim Burton. He never fails to deliver a consistent vision, and while I will agree that may start to grate, especially if it is not your thing to start with, it feels perfect for this film. They should have been a match made in heaven- hence the excitement I could not quash.<br/><br/>The performances are good- although the mad hatter and his Scottish split personality was baffling. Alice is also somewhat flatter than she once was, but Mia has charm.<br/><br/>So the problem? The same problem that jumps up in far to many of Burtons films. The plot- or rather and I think here this is an important distinction, the story. Alice, the original, was never plotted in that oh so generic manner that most Hollywood films are. In the vein of other journey tales such as The Hobbit, it meandered, revelling in the wonder of its own world, the true narrative arc being the internal one of the main character. In the Hollywood world of inciting incidents, pivotal points, climax, and resolution this is not acceptable. We have, as we must have, a villain, a battle, a swash buckling heroine- god forbid Alice runs and squeals like a normal girl- all the subtlety, ambiguity and irreverent charming nonsense of the original is pushed aside for starkly drawn good versus evil morality, cheap sexual overtones and high stakes 'tension'. I use quotes because the so called tension they attempted to create with the ugly bander-whatever, the dark desires of the Red Queen and the final apocalyptic battle felt about as exciting as Beachgrove Gardens.<br/><br/>Burton is not a writer. And I personally feel that to be a great director you have to be a writer. Even if you cannot write dialogue, you must have an instinctive eye for story. He does not. He should have stuck with animation or cinematography. There he excels. I am now at the stage where I will pointedly avoid his films. However if this comes on tele I will say watch it for the lovely visuals, it's free."

","While I had fun when I saw the movie in cinema I would lie If I would say I think it is as half good as most of Tim Burton movies.<br/><br/>One of main problem its the plot. I don't mind the idea of Alice returning to wonderland and re-facing all the events in those books but here it turn into your typical fantasy scenario : There is a prophecy that the main heroine has to kill a monster, she don't want to do it, have some adventures, change her mind, do her job... adventure over. Yhe, we seen it a hundred times.<br/><br/>The second big problem is that its not Trippe enough. IT'S TIM BURTON and ALICE IN WONDERLAND! It's connection should create a bizzar mind blowing acid trip. But no. He play it safe. We get few terrific visuals now and then and I which exception of the Mad Hatter visually this must be the most faithful ""Alice in Wondelrand"" but not as big acid trip people would expect from the mind of Tim Burton. <br/><br/>I guess since it was a Disney movie so it must by family friendly.<br/><br/>One last problem - the main heroin is so stiff. I think it was meant to be contrast with more wacky character but while they where ad least interesting she was pretty bland for most of the movie. <br/><br/>Compering to other Tim Burton films it probably third or forth weakest, but at the same time the kids will love it and there are few scenes and character you will probably enjoy. So yhe - its not as bad people say but its not masterpiece."
"longcooljolie","4","1","2","6 February 2011"," Tim Burton's latest Vanity Project: over-bloated Alice
","2010's Alice In Wonderland came out with the usual amount of fanfare and commercial tie-ins for a Tim Burton movie. As of this writing, early February 2011, it is being run on cable movie networks, which means there will be plenty of people who will be glad they waited to watch it there than plunk down $10+ hard earned dollars for it when it ran at cinemas.<br/><br/>This, probably more than any other TB offering to date, amplifies and personifies what his movies are like: a sandwich filed a foot high with condiments and finery and other useless glop. It may be pleasant and even beautiful to look at but overstuffed, over-bloated, and difficult to swallow.<br/><br/>Some of it has to do with the source material. In the early days of movies, when executives wanted to make a movie of the Lewis Carroll tale, producers fought amongst themselves. They asserted that the convoluted and often nonsensical novel was practically unfilmable. Nevertheless, several versions of it came into being, the most popular of which was the sanitized and Disneyfied cartoon.<br/><br/>Of course, ""making sense"" never seems to be a priority for Tim Burton. The movie does have some strengths: the casting is good, and Burton's squeeze Helena Bonham-Carter makes an appropriately gaudily grotesque Red Queen. Anne Hathaway does a lovely, ethereal turn as the White Queen, the frenetic Crispin Glover oozes creepily from the screen as a Black Knave, and, as other reviewers have pointed out Alan Rickman nearly steals the show voicing the character of the Blue Caterpillar.<br/><br/>And then there is TB go-to guy Johnny Depp. Give credit to the costume department and makeup for managing to make Depp look like a CGI character, with his amber eyes beneath bushy, stick-like orange brows. The Hatter is Mad, no doubt about that, as Johnny Depp does well to hint at the insanity lurking just below the surface.<br/><br/>The problem? These characters are given little to do other than flit about through beautiful sets and glorious computer animation. On IMDb's front page for Alice in Wonderland, the second FAQ listed is ""What is the movie about?"" It is about Hollywood executives and financiers continuing to bankroll this overrated self-styled demigod and his pals so that they continue to pollute the cinematic landscape with ridiculous, overblown pap."

","Visuals & special effects - check! Costumes - check! Musical score - check! New leading young actress - check! Tim Burton gothicness - check! So why wasn't I blown away by Alice In Wonderland? It had some dark undertones & creepiness, but I really wanted more. Something darker & more sinister, like Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth. I wanted meaner & grosser creatures, but Tim Burton can't seem to go all the way, especially when funded by Disney. So, like all his other movies, he almost makes a cool, Gothic film.<br/><br/>I digress, but Tim Burton, like Johnny Depp & Helena Bonham Carter, can't seem to cross into greatness because of their Disney connections. Let's face it, Disney doesn't want to alienate their young fans and offend parents. But I think they would shine better if they did their own, independent thing. I'm sick of Depp doing goofy franchise roles (Pirates of the Caribbean) or cartoon voice-overs. I want to see some real acting! Kick it up a notch folks.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland was good, not great. It fell short because 1) it was too long and dragged toward the end, 2) it was not creepy, dark or scary enough. It was clearly a Disney production."
"johnbirch-2","3","1","2","31 December 2010"," Miss-titled misfiring mistaken mess?
","To begin at the beginning (as the Queen of Hearts says... in the book), this is not Alice in Wonderland. Yes, I know its a Tim Burton re- imagining, but that is not what I mean. What I mean is this is Alice Through the Looking Glass - 90% of the characters and what remains recognisable from the original plot is Looking Glass, not Wonderland. <br/><br/>Does this matter? Yes - because it betrays a complete lack of any knowledge and feeling for Carol and Alice to mix the two books together, even in a ""re-imagining"", even by Burton. Especially by Burton. Its just plain lazy. As another reviewer has said, it even makes you wonder if Burton has read the books, or done anything at all other than watch the original (and truly dreadful) Disney cartoon.<br/><br/>Then to compound that by throwing in the ""jabberwocky"" (and he even gets that wrong - the creature is a ""jabberwock"" for heaven's sake - read the damn poem, Burton!), and then centre the film round that??? A story within story that is not Wonderland anyway? Lazy, unthinking, meaningless.<br/><br/>And then make it a dragon too! Lazy, lazy, lazy! Forget the Tenniel picture, read the poem, and work out for yourself what a MANXome foe that scratches with its claws is! Do some damn research, Burton! Let's just TRY to be original, shall we? Isn't that what you are famous for?<br/><br/>What makes it even more annoying, even if you ignore all of the above, is that the film could so easily have been so much better. Because the initial conceit is promising. Call her anything other than Alice and you have the tale of a young woman finding herself in her own childhood dream/nightmare. Wonderland is, in so many ways, a nightmare - not a cuddly dream, and who better than Burton to realise this?<br/><br/>But from this great, exciting, edge of the seat start it all goes horribly wrong. Alice not only fails to remember her dream (a fact that totally contradicts the opening scenes), but shows not emotion at all when all kinds of strange things happen - things that made the child Alice cry. Weird stuff abounds, but for no reason or plot purpose - the Red Queen's head being just one example.<br/><br/>We have a plot device added by Burton - a scroll that predicts the future and which Alice sort of tries to escape from (well, in a very half-hearted way, frankly). Could this be a theme, you think? A point? A purpose? Nope - remove the scroll from the story and you'd lose nothing. So what the heck was the point of having it?<br/><br/>Yes, its a very pretty film - a memorable, visual feast. But you need more than pretty pictures to make a film - you need a story, a point, something to say. This says nothing. Other than a lazy man with no clear ideas getting by on reputation.<br/><br/>So - a couple of points for the visuals, and one bonus for the potential shown at the start. But zilch for the rest."

","Like many other reviewers, I had high hopes for this film. Like many other reviewers, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>It is not that the film is ""dark"". Tim Burton's dark side is sometimes inspirational, sometimes powerful - indeed, Edward Scissorshand left me in a funk for about a week, an experience that others have had from what I have gathered.<br/><br/>But this film, with the exception of the last few minutes, falls flat. It generally meanders along for some reason.<br/><br/>This is not to say that there are some decent moments in it. Certainly Johnny Depp is fun to watch, although I get the feeling that I am watching Jack Sparrow. Helen Bonham-Carter is interesting as the Red Queen, and Mia Wasikowska as Alice is fun to watch. A high point is Crispin Glover's portrayal as the Knave - I found myself interested in the character. But Anne Hathaway as the White Queen was a disappointment, initially coming across as a being an air head rather than a genuine regal character.<br/><br/>My other complaint is the general setting.

"matteotiberia","2","1","2","3 October 2010"," Tim Burton's Alice?
","This was supposed to be ""Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland"" but what I saw was not Alice neither Tim Burton's. I usually need a couple of days to formulate my opinion on a movie, and the few hours after the end I usually pretend to myself that I have (at least mildly) enjoyed it, just not to think it was a waste of time and money. With ""Alice"" I started to think ""what a bad movie"" probably after the first half. <br/><br/>I must say I never read the original books, but my personal image of Alice was made by the Disney classic and that movie is what I compare Burton's one to. The cool thing of the old Alice was that it lacked a proper plot, it was just Alice wandering around in a magical and strange place encountering strange creatures. You followed her and it was like being in the trip (defintely the appropriate word) with her, wonderful! Now this movie wants to add a plot using that universe, making it look like a Narnia setting. Why? probably Burton didn't want to risk making a movie without a plot. Using a grown up Alice was a bad idea, Alice is a metaphor of a childhood which is going to end soon, a 20years-old Alcie doesn't make sense. I didn't see anything of the onirical vision of the first movie and the bad thing is I didn't see almost anything of the Burton wonderful imaginary. When I heard about Burton's Alice I was expecting a dark remake of the classic story, but what I saw is more a boring fantasy film with no particular ideas. You can say it was made by Tim looking at the usual actors, his wife and Johnny Depp. God how I hated Johnny Depp here! Im definitely not a big fan of him, but this time I think is the worst acting he ever made. He play the mad hatter, but that wasn't a mad hatter, he wasn't even mad! He was smart and just a little bit clowny, he was JOHNNY DEPP, saying ""look at me, I am johnny depp!"".<br/><br/>There is no reason to see it, especially now that it is no more in theaters and you can't enjoy the stunning visuals (of course it has stunning visuals...its 2010, a lot of money on cgi and you have it).<br/><br/>2012 EDIT: I have now read the two Alice's books. The film is even worse than I thought."
"estebangonzalez10","Null","1","2","16 September 2010"," Burton Could have gave us some more muchness
","Â¨You used to be much more...muchier. You've lost your muchness.Â¨ Those are the words the Mad Hatter tells Alice after she has returned to Wonderland, but now much older as a 19 year old girl who has no memory of her last visit there when she was a little kid. Tim Burton directs this classic Disney tale and he teams up once again with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. They have already worked together in Sweeney Todd, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Depp and Burton have a profound respect for each other and it is always a pleasure to experience one of their creative films. When I heard they were going to work together in this film I was really excited because I knew that Burton could do something memorable with Wonderland. He is one of the most imaginative and creative directors and Wonderland was way ahead of its time when it came out in 1951. I wasn't a big fan of the cartoon because it was missing a story, but the characters and the world that was created was very imaginative nonetheless. Burton had a lot of interesting material to work with here and he did a great job although perhaps I was expecting a bit too much. This is far better than the cartoon because there is a better plot and a decent story this time, but the characters didn't seem as mad as they were in the original. I was surprised that this time around they all made sense, but I guess you need that in order to have a good story. The visuals and the effects were also amazing so Burton was successful in recreating this world.<br/><br/>The story takes place many years after Alice has visited Wonderland and she has no memory of her visit there. She is now a nineteen year old girl who is getting ready for a banquet which is thrown in her honor although she doesn't know it yet. Alice (played by Mia Wasikowska who could recently been seen in Amelia) is not happy about having to dress up for the event and she is still dreaming about a different world where she doesn't have to do what she is expected. She still has some of the same attitudes that she had in the original film. Alice soon finds out from her cousins that the banquet is thrown in her honor because Hamish (Leo Bill) is going to propose to her and that she is expected to say yes because he is a Duke. Alice doesn't have feelings for Hamish and she can't say yes and is suddenly distracted by a rabbit that is running across the yard and decides to follow it. She ends up falling through a rabbit hole and ends upside down in a locked room very similar to the one in the original film. She finds a key in the table but it only opens a very small door so she can't get through it. This is perhaps one of the most similar scenes to the original except that there is no talking doorknob this time, and Alice still has no memory of this place even though she goes through the exact same situation of shrinking and then getting larger. Once in Wonderland, or should I say Underland because the other was the name that Alice had given it when she was a child, she runs into the same creatures she had been with in the past such as Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas), the white rabbit (Micheal Sheen from Frost/Nixon), the blue caterpillar (Alan Rickman from the Harry Potter series), the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), and the Red Queen (Helen Bonham Carter) among others. There are also some new characters like the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), Stayne the knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover from Charlie's Angels), Bandersnatch, and the Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed more about this film than the original one is that there was an actual plot to this story. Alice had a mission this time around and she was not just running after the white rabbit. There is much more action and Burton does a great job at recreating this world. Johnny Depp is great as usual and his character was probably one of the best in the movie and the reason why many people wanted to see Alice in the first place. Mia Wasikowska also does a good job as she has the lead role in the film. Burton still recreates certain elements from the original such as the entrance to Wonderland, the scene where the Red Queen is playing wicket using a flamingo for a stick, and the famous riddle that the Mad Hatter asks, Â¨why is a raven like a writing desk? Â¨ to which we still don't get an answer too because there isn't one really. The movie works and the visuals are great, but you are still left with a sense that there could be so much more done with this movie. Wonderland is a magical place, but to rephrase the words the Mad Hatter tells Alice it seems that this movie was missing something more...muchier. We could have used some more of Burton's famous muchness."
"sddavis63","4","1","2","5 September 2010"," A Burton-Depp Disappointment
","Here we have yet another in the seemingly never-ending Tim Burton-Johnny Depp partnerships. Unfortunately, here we do not have one of the stronger Tim Burton-Johnny Depp partnerships. ""Alice in Wonderland"" stands as a disappointment when all is said and done, in spite of the fact that it has a number of things going for it, not the least of which is - well - Burton and Depp. The movie lends itself to each in their classic styles. Depp gets to play another in his huge repertoire of unusual characters (in this case, he's the Mad Hatter) while re-creating Wonderland is a perfect match with Burton's quirky directorial style, and he does so with the typical Burton touch. Wonderland becomes a very dark and ominous place in this movie. In addition to these two main figures, there are pretty good performances from Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen (""off with his head!"") and Mia Wasikowska was fine as a 20-year old Alice who's about to become engaged as the story begins (the movie is essentially an account of Alice re-visiting Wonderland.) I haven't seen much of Wasikowska's work. I can't say she blew me away in the role, but she also didn't drive me away! The animated effects were also pretty good.<br/><br/>The whole thing fails though at the basic but obviously vital level of story. It's quite frankly not all that interesting, and certainly much could have been done with the delightfully larger than life characters that Lewis Carroll created so long ago. While understanding, of course, that Alice is the title character, I thought Depp's Mad Hatter was unfortunately under-used for the most part. I also found the connections between Alice's almost-engagement at the beginning and end of the movie strangely disconnected from everything that happened in between. What was the need to have her almost engaged to Hamish? What purpose did that serve? What plot point did it advance? Perhaps, I suppose, that Alice needed to escape from an undesirable situation, and retreating to Wonderland allowed her to do that, but the connection was tenuous at best. I appreciated the obvious effort that everyone put into this, but the end result was still largely disappointing."

","Alice in Wonderland is an amazing story on both a child and adult level, in large part because it is so clever and filled with double meanings pervaded by a sense of unreality. Take an awesome story like this, combine it with a great actor like Depp and an obvious master of CGI like Burton and one expects to be blown out of their seat with wonderment and magic.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the reality is not so much. None of the characters are particularly endearing -- although Alice gives it a try -- nor memorable. The card/soldiers were actually better in some of the cartoon versions of the story -- at least they had faces and expressions. These were neither scary nor did they show discernible emotion but came off like characters in a low resolution video game. The ""hookah smoking character"" we know and love was a complete dud. At least the Red Queen was mildly amusing, but never much more than that. And Depp, incredibly enough, was more boring than anything else.<br/><br/>What can I say? Ouch."

","Alice in Wonderland was one of my most anticipated of 2010, and I wish I was still waiting. The film, while somewhat solid, never seems to hit its stride. It moves at an extremely plodding pace and the plot is very uneven. Mia Wasikowska does a fine job as the soon-to-be-married Alice, but the screenplay lets her down. Oscar nominees Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Anne Hathaway also deliver solid performances. The climactic showdown is sketchily choreographed with uninteresting action. A lazy ending and sinister tone ruins what should be a fun, interesting romp through Wonderland. Tim Burton does prove he can deliver a well-executed backstory and fabulous visuals, but this is one of his weaker efforts."

Johnny Depp was just weird and not good weird, but just weird weird as the Mad Hatter. His make-up looked more out of a zombie movie than Alice. The Cheshire cat did not behave like a Cheshire cat - no disappearing a leaving just a smile. But I may be wrong because about this time, I had to fight to keep awake and I did doze off now and then. Somewhere toward the end, I did manage to wake up. It looked like there might be something developing between Alice and the Mad Hatter. In a flashback I had seen him before the red queen took over and he looked like Johnny Depp with weird hair. So I thought maybe when the white queen won he might return to being Johnny Depp and Alice might find him more attractive and interesting than the dork back home. But alas, no. He stayed a zombie and she went home, but at least she refused the dork. I told myself I would watch it again, but I couldn't. It was too boring. There are only two Tim Burton films that I didn't finish - not because they were bad, but because they bothered me in some way. Edward Sissorhands was just too sad. It was like a tragedy but without a tragic hero. Watching Edward was like watching someone torturing a puppy. Couldn't take it. The beloved Ed Wood was just too outrÃ© for me. I loved or really liked everything else, even Mars Attacks. But Alice was boring. I still can't believe that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp ruined a movie they were born to make. Go watch the Disney version. No kidding, it is better."
"jennyisampson","9","1","2","1 August 2010"," Alice in Wonderland is a great continuation of the classic and teaches the importance of facing fears and being true to yourself.
","Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a film full of mystery, magic, mayhem, and delectable characters that add to the story. Alice teaches us, in her journey, that facing your fears and staying true to yourself is much more just and advantageous than doing what others think are best for you. Alice Kinsleigh's (Mia Wasikowska) Father begins this lesson as the movie opens and Alice is seen as a seven-year-old child having a bad dream. She asks her father if she has gone around the bend as she keeps dreaming of chasing a white rabbit down a hole and landing in a mysterious land. Alice's Father responds by telling her all great people are somewhat mad.<br/><br/>The movie then takes you thirteen years ahead to Alice being publicly proposed to and running away from the fear of making a decision she will regret, but one that everyone feels is best for her. Alice finds the white rabbit, and you guessed it, chases him until she falls down a hole into what we know as Wonderland. The story follows the original movie until Alice enters Wonderland. There she is met by familiar characters, but they keep asking if she is ""THE"" Alice and referring to their world as Underland, instead of Wonderland. The lighting and color schemes are darker and drearier in Underland. It appears stormy, and the characters are somewhat distraught. It is the very opposite of Dorothy entering Oz. However, as the story continues the viewer understands the dreariness, and Alice learns why and how she fits into the puzzle.<br/><br/>Alice's new friends, which include a white rabbit (voiced by Stephen Fry), a Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), a chain-smoking caterpillar (Alan Rickman), and twins Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb (Matt Lucas), help her to realize that she is ""THE"" Alice, and this is not her first trip to Underland. Alice realizes that she has returned to save Underland from the Evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). The Evil Queen's younger sister is introduced in this movie, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) from whom the Evil Red Queen has stolen the kingdom and has initiated a very harsh ruling. There is an interesting parallel between the two Queens, Tim Burton style. The Red Queen and her kingdom, as we recall from the classic, are playing cards all of which are evil and cruel; however, the White Queen and her followers are based on the game of chess and very sweet and kind, but with a hint of weird. It is a large chessboard where the two come together to fight, and where Alice's new perspective helps her to realize that her destiny involves defeating the evil Jabberwocky (Christopher Lee) and restoring order in Underland.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is phenomenal. The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) is a character that is weird and somewhat insane, but one that you are drawn to almost instantly. The costumes are outrageous, but tie in nicely with the film's storyline. Alice's dresses are not anything like we remember from the classic, but rather much more fashionable and trendy. The entire cast of animal characters talk, which we expected, and each play a part in helping Alice to face her fears and trust in herself. The viewer is drawn into the world, and the imagination allows you to believe that it could exist, and a great place to face your fears and learn how to trust yourself. It is a must see film."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","5","1","2","21 July 2010"," Hard to like a ""Wonderland"" when the story has no wonder
","When Tim Burton and Disney present you a pretty little 3-D film with a tag on it that says ""Watch Me,"" you're likely to indulge. The prospect of one of the finest fantasy directors (who's a bit mad himself) creating the beloved and colorful world of Lewis Carroll's classic children's tales in the era of CGI and 3-D seems flawless. Yet somehow, the magic factor does not find its way where it is needed most: the story.<br/><br/>While 3-D films are still novel, CGI is not. Not even James Cameron's ""Avatar"" could win audiences on visual effects alone; it needed a classic story. Linda Woolverton's take on ""Alice in Wonderland"" preaches classic ""dream the impossible"" and ""carve your own destiny"" themes, but they're not organic in this plot. To fit in all the classic characters from the both Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass,"" Woolverton throws them in like set decorations. Perhaps Burton too is a bit ignorant and doesn't let us discover these characters so much as smack us over the head with them like a flamingo croquet mallet. The only instance where we get to know these characters is the Mad Hatter's tea party, which was likely because of Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>The story is a ""return to Wonderland"" premise. Alice (Mia Wasikowska) dreamed of Wonderland as a little girl, but now she's 19 years old and she's just arrived at a fancy party which she does not know is in honor of her wedding engagement, which she's not expecting and isn't sure she wants. When the white rabbit shows up she follows him down the rabbit hole and the familiar adventures begin, only Alice conveniently doesn't realize she was there before as a little girl so that all the memorable scenes and characters can come back.<br/><br/>The truth is that Wonderland (apparently called Underland) is very different from the one we know as far as what's going on there. The Red Queen, played with the right amount of quirk and arrogance by Helena Bonham-Carter, runs a cruel regime. Supposedly Alice is the only one who can end it by slaying the giant Jabberwocky, but she's not all that sure that's her destiny either. In fact, she insists she's dreaming.<br/><br/>There aren't many unexpected turns of events from there. By the trailers alone, it's fairly obvious Alice won't be too reluctant to save Wonde--er--Underland. Now that we're not concerned about what happens next, we turn to the wide array of colorful characters to entertain us.<br/><br/>Anyone familiar with the original stories probably had a scene or a character in mind that they were looking forward too. For me, I was excited for Absalom the hookah-puffing caterpillar, in part because he's voiced by Alan Rickman. He pops up at the beginning as the know-all figure the others turn to and then a few times in between, but it's not enough to soak up the character. That's pretty much the story with everyone except the Mad Hatter. Depp is allowed a rangy performance from sentimental moments with Alice to full-on random Scottish brogue. It's no surprise that he and Bonham-Carter, the Tim Burton regulars, are both the funniest and most interesting because they're full of surprises. No two line deliveries are exactly the same -- that's the quirkiness of a Tim Burton film and there wasn't enough of it.<br/><br/>I didn't have the chance to catch this film in theaters or in 3-D, so I won't comment on the visual effects. However, the environment of Wonderland was hardly a ""character,"" which all the best setting are; they play integral roles in the film. The production team put together these CGI landscapes but they go unexplored. One example of strong environment integration was the floating (assumed decapitated) heads in the Red Queen's moat that tiny Alice crosses like lily pads. Once again, something you'd expect more of from Burton.<br/><br/>""Alice in Wonderland"" is simply childish. It would appeal most to children and the story and character integration are best described as amateur. There was so much more about these characters and their world that seem worthy of exploration, but there was no chance for it in ""Wonderland."" For a story that is about championing imagination and the impossible, there was nothing inspiring and magical about it other than a few key performances. At least Wasikowska was a likable Alice with the right balance of skepticism and curiosity. Unfortunately, I was far more interested in what happened to her before she fell into the rabbit hole and I doubt some 3-D glasses would've changed my mind.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"
"scarletminded","6","1","2","8 July 2010"," Alice without the charm, wit or amusement of the books...seems like it was just made to make money, which it did!
","It sort of bothered me the characters had names as opposed to the Cheshire Cat, The Caterpillar, etc. It was like I was waiting for the names to be explained and they seems to just throw Narnia sounding names in for the characters without a thought. It really took me out of the movie. <br/><br/>I thought the Caterpillar ""Who are you?"" speech would be more inspired. In the old Disney film it was. I thought the Cat was a bit creepy too, like more icky creepy than fun creepy.<br/><br/>And the break dancing Hatter was odd too. I read reviews where people said the film would explain more about the Hatter, yet I really didn't learn anything more from him. I guess some dancing and naming characters is supposed to add depth, which it didn't.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie could have been WAY WORSE. It could have been all trendy lingo and dumb jokes, but it wasn't up to Carroll wit at all. I wish this would have been a musical, since Burton did OK with Sweeney Todd. It would have given it charm where this had none.<br/><br/>Wasn't it the Queen of Hearts that said ""off with her head?""<br/><br/>I get the arm thing the White Queen was doing, since she was supposed to be ""la-dee-da"" but it wasn't combined with any decent acting, so it came off rather odd.<br/><br/>And the Jabberwock...notice I left out the y there...because it doesn't have one...did anyone read the Alice books here? I mean, they must have because the ""eat me, drink me"" scene seems out of the book. I didn't get why she was back to fight this monster because he was killed in the poem and the poem was a parody anyway. It just seems like every film now has to have a struggle of good and evil, it can't just be. The Alice story is supposed to be fun and full of nonsense, not be a good/evil struggle.<br/><br/>In a way, it reminds me of Return to Oz, where Dorothy comes back to find Oz all messed up. Yeah, I liked that movie much better. At least Return to Oz tried. <br/><br/>Overall, I watched this for free, so I can't say it wasn't worth the money I paid to view it and I got through it though the two people I was watching it with fell asleep and I don't really blame them. I mean, the pace of the film was fast enough and colorful enough and gave me enough WTF moments to get me to the end! <br/><br/>I wish there would have been more plot around Alice wanting to be a New Woman. I mean, sure she doesn't want to marry a guy, but then all of a sudden, she's a trading merchant apprentice? In the Victorian era? Maybe they wanted a pirate type sequel? And the Caterpillar turning into a butterfly would have been a great metaphor if Alice had changed during her visit but I really couldn't see that, maybe it was all the stiff acting. All the characters were so 2-D, I was dying for a bit of real acting.<br/><br/>And the Hatter, though not as weird and out of place as Depp's Willy Wonka, was still playing weird for weird's sake. Tim Burton is better than that, so why does he keep doing this? It seems the movie was only made to make money, which it did and I guess kids like seeing flashing colors, 3-D and a lot of movement...though I do believe even small children like a fairy tale to have a plot...maybe not anymore. <br/><br/>I give it a six. One for Crispin, one for Chris Lee, one for the good use of effects in Eat Me, Drink Me scene, one for the outfits, one for the scene where the White Queen is making a potion since it made my friend laugh and one for the fact it wasn't three hours long and knew when to quit. Now if it only knew how to cultivate charm and wit!"

","There are 4 distinct aspects of a film. 1)Story 2)Graphics 3)Acting/Cast 4)Dialogue<br/><br/>1) The story of Alice in Wonderland was very straightforward. It had none of the twists that most movie lovers simply adore, but one must understand that the purpose of Alice in Wonderland, both Caroll's books and Burton's film is not essentially tha fascinating story, but the creation of a fantastic revived world. <br/><br/>2) Graphics were top notch. I wish I watched this film in IMAX 3D. No complaints here. This is what would entertain most in the film.<br/><br/>3) The acting. I fell in love with Alice, and I thought Johnny Depp was mad... really, he pulled off the role in a way i neither expected or anticipated, but in my opinion the most impressive actor was between him and the Red Queen. Oh The Red Queen and that her Big Head.<br/><br/>4) Dialogue... crappy (except where Johnny has his mood swings, in some places though, it is very funny, but leaves a critical viewer with the feeling that the ""joke"" was set up, instead of flowing naturally.<br/><br/>All in all, there are only two flaws, the all to straightforward story, and the crappy dialogue. everything else makes it a must see 6.6/10"
"gradyharp","8","1","2","3 June 2010"," 'After all, this is MY dream.'
","ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a merry mixed bag of a film. The criticisms range from adulation to condemnation and that usually identifies an artwork worth visiting. No, this is not Lewis Carroll's wondrous book intact: it s a variation on a theme of that book and there are so many aspects of the original here that those whose childhoods (and adulthoods) captured so much of the wild imagination and hilarious dialogue of this ma group of otherland creations that the film will at least connect on many levels to everyone. One suspects that with the manner in which the movie begins (a haughty 'engagement announcement' party at which the now 19 year old Alice Kingsleigh is set up to become betrothed to a dullard geek and runs from the gazebo setting out of dismay) is the reason for the restoration of individualism in the Alice that returns from slide down the rabbit hole return to Wonderland. Linda Woolverton's screenplay is creaky at times, but wisely keeps enough of the fantasy alive before drowning it in an ending that is perilously close to gluttonous CGI mess. <br/><br/>The flavor is pure Tim Burton and his style fits this adaptation well. To justify the return of the elder Alice to the world at the end of the rabbit hole Burton has to have a driver: Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is needed to evict the evil Red Queen (Helen Bonham Carter so that the good White Queen (a miscast Anne Hathaway) can restore calm and order to Underland. Many of Carroll's characters are used as CGI creations - Tweedledum/Tweedledee (voice of Matt Lucas), Cheshire Cat (voice of Stephen Fry), the White Rabbit (voice of Michael Sheen), the Blue Caterpillar (a wonderful voice character for Alan Rickman), the talking Flowers (voice of Imelda Staunton), and the hound dog Bayard (voice of Timothy Spall), etc. The Mad Hatter is well captured by Johnny Depp and some genuine realism is added via the transformative presence of Marton Csokas as the young Alice's now departed father Charles Kingsleigh. <br/><br/>Where the movie gets off track is the final battle with the monsters that protect the Red Queen. It just gets expensively silly here and certainly not a film for young children: the violence is disturbing. But there is enough to like in this DVD version - even without the advantage (I suppose there was one) of theatrical 3D. And as Alice keeps reminding everyone, 'This is MY dream.' <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"MovieProductions","6","1","2","1 June 2010"," While ""Alice"" may be Burton's weakest, it's sufficient
","**1/2 out of (****)<br/><br/>After the plethora of advertisements and trailers, after the promotion in Hot Topic stores, and after all the insane hype, Burton's ""Alice"" has finally debuted. Now, that brings us to the major question: Does it live to its endless anticipation? Sadly, no. It's rather disappointing because of a weak script and any emotion that was in Burton's previous projects, has been completely drained out in ""Wonderland"". Sadly, if not for the scenery, this movie would have been beyond awful. The good news? The performances are great and the movie, visually, is the best I've seen. Is this a recommendation? Yes, but very slight.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland centers around Alice, who is about to get married, when she backs out and accidentally falls down a rabbit hole. (How amusing right?). There, she's in ""Wonderland"", also known as ""Underland"", and it's said that she is the Alice who will fight the Jabberwocky. Although, many have accused Alice of not being the true warrior who has the capability of killing the Jabberwocky. Although, Alice has more problems on her hands. The Red Queen is trying to reign over ""Wonderland"".<br/><br/>First, let's get to the negatives. We all know the ""Burton"" that gave us such powerful scripts as ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"", but this time around, he gave us a weak script that is just as hollow as the rabbit hole Alice falls into in the beginning of the film. We never go in-depth with Wonderland. The only thing we do is just explore the Wonderland, that's pretty much it. Also, when the film tries to be emotional or trying to pluck on your heart strings, it seems forced in and never comes off as authentic. This movie is very heartless and lacks a lot of emotion. Furthermore, there are some nonsensical scenes that add nothing to the film, but are rather filler. Moreover, the 3-D is very shabby. It is conversion 3-D and you can tell within the first ten minutes. The picture looks grainy and very unnatural. To add to that, the opening and resolution of the film are highly disappointing.<br/><br/>Now, onto the positives. I did really love the characters, including Alice. All were root-worthy and surpassed my moderate expectations. Moreover, I thought the scenery was just beautiful. Every scene is polished to the fullest extent. Very vibrant and certainly worth the look. Furthermore, I thought the movie was very entertaining. For the most part, the movie catches your attention. To add to that, the characters were also very logical and complex as well.<br/><br/>While it seems more like a bash than a recommendation, I did enjoy Burton's Alice in Wonderland. However, it is very flawed. The script is stale, the movie is emotionally drained, and it lacks substance. Although, with great performances, beautiful scenery, and a great pace, this ""Alice"" is sufficient. Even if Burton may never hit a home run like he used to, at least he didn't go through the route of Ridley Scott. Albeit, I do advise a matinée. And if you have to pick a dimension, pick 2-D."
"jazza923","7","1","2","1 June 2010"," Typical Tim Burton
","Alice in Wonderland has never been one of my favorite stories, and although Tim Burton doesn't quite capture the essence of the book, for me it was a good thing. The look of the film is very expressive with the typical Burton trademark of wildly imaginative visuals and expressiveness. The performances are quite good, particularly Helena Bonham Carter doing a great job imitating Bette Davis in The Virgin Queen and The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex. Wonderfully photographed, superb costume design and the score is well suited to the film. It's not perfect by any means, but Tim Burton is always worth a look, and I was not disappointed."
"daryl42-1","6","1","2","3 May 2010"," The film falls flat on its stomach as soon as Alice does herself.
","6.5<br/><br/>There's a truth in life that everyone sees things differently. Different environments, different lots, and different biologies make (although not really accounted to these factors) different people. Other things, such as sex and age make for a different perspective in a person. A child, a teenager, an adult, and an older person view the world respectively. Certain things such as love, violence, personalities, fear, and all kinds of other things in life are responded to and perceived differently by people of different ages. Some people tend to favor the abstract side of things. You may argue that children often tend to follow this trend.<br/><br/>It may have been with this in mind that Lewis Carroll penned Alice's Adventures In Wonderland in 1865. Children, I believe (at least I can say this about my own childhood), have an interesting take on life. Certain personalities can be transformed into exaggerated characters. Certain attributes as well can be exaggerated. Something that is large can appear to be immense. Just as well as something that is tiny can appear to be the smallest thing possible. The characters in Wonderland, of which the book is focused on, rather than the setting itself, may be representatives of Alice's real word associates. In the Tim Burton film, we see at the end of it that Alice relates some persons to their Wonderland counterparts. The original work, including the Disney animated film are great. Every scene, or character, is memorable and well depicted.<br/><br/>The same cannot be said about the 2010 film. While the characters aren't bad, they are certainly not memorable. Ask anyone who has seen the Burton film. What is the caterpillar's traits? What is he like? Who is he? If you've only seen the Burton film, chances are you're going to have some trouble in describing this character. So, such as it is, arguably the greatest strength of the Alice In Wonderland series is where the Burton film comes short. I have no ultimately negative criticisms on the director, nor the cast and crew who worked on this film. They all did their jobs (while some of the performances/jobs done were more memorable than others), but in the end the film does not deliver on the film front nor on the Alice In Wonderland front.<br/><br/>The other major flaw of the film is the plot. While not sticking to the original, they opted to go for more of a sequel format. What results is not the greatest or even at least remotely exciting sub plot ever for the universe. But again, this isn't the problem. The problem is the execution. A final battle results in a dull environment that exhibits almost amateurish film-making. Once again, I respect Burton, the cast, and the crew, but I was very disappointed with this film.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie has some success. It is only really half bad, but it could have been so good. As a fan of the book and original animated film, I was interested in this film. The live action take on the characters in Wonderland (especially The Queen) is great. I can't say the same about the environments. It starts off good, but soon falls flat on its stomach about as hard and as fast as Alice herself does in the beginning, and it also happens to do so at exactly that point. The 3D technology used in the film didn't bring much to the table. There is really not much to recommend here, but don't dismiss it as it is not a total failure. Just a slight disappointment when living up to the formula of combining the previous Alice In Wonderland works and the works of the cast and crew in the film."
"rzajac","6","1","2","21 March 2010"," Pointless
","How do you cinematize a literary masterpiece? Now, don't assume I'm one of those purists who'll never be satisfied.<br/><br/>Burton could have done one or more of the following things:<br/><br/>1) Reproduce the original.<br/><br/>2) Create a new, ""parallel universe"" story that captures the same degree of subversiveness as the original.<br/><br/>3) Modify the original to taste, but imbue Carroll's original images with a new power.<br/><br/>Burton did not repro the original.<br/><br/>He created a sort of storybook pastiche using the characters and a few scenarios from the original. But the subversion he engineers (Alice emerging to transcend the demands of class and status) is puny and tame compared to the big dogs that Carroll takes on.<br/><br/>In a few, few instances, Burton did actually sort of grab me by the throat and make me see the depths of an original, Carrollian, image.<br/><br/>For instance, when we first encounter the tea party, and the camera swoops in on the table, I was whupped upside the head by an inescapable, very dark realization: This is a harrowing depiction of the nature of spiritual madness. It starts out like a tea party, but the striving for stasis--the idea that we must try, at all costs, to preserve this beautiful moment--eventually turns it evil.<br/><br/>But, really, that was about it.<br/><br/>I also didn't appreciate (Spoiler Alert! Here comes my inner purist!) them calling the creature ""a Jabberwocky"". That oversight on the parts of the writers and artistic directors--whom one would have presumed to be Carroll aficionados--sort of took me by surprise. The creature is called a ""Jabberwock"", and a poem celebrating its heroic hunting and demise could well be called ""Jabberwocky"": This in the grand tradition of naming an ode after a noun by adding an ""-y"" suffix. If that seems nitpicky, just remember that Carroll was notably fastidious about such things.<br/><br/>At any rate, I guess I would have liked to feel that the gang who produced this would have done a better job of artfully scraping away just enough of the aesthetic distancing afforded by the genre of Victorian Children's Literature that we could see with our own eyes (else what's cinema for?) a little more of Carroll's subversive otherworld.<br/><br/>Instead we got a porridge (granted, thicker than gruel) of more of the Hollywood same."

","When i watched this film i knew from the start that it would be another typical adventure/peril film, i found it rather bland, repetitive and nothing really happened. The base story at the beginning of the film was unoriginal and had no real contribution to the story as a whole.<br/><br/>The character of Alice was not one of depth, she was rather one dimensional and not an individual that the viewer can relate with. The land of fantasy that Alice entered is something that we have all seen in many other films.<br/><br/>However, the character of the Mad Hatter was cleverly constructed and reflected everything that was expected. He had an in depth story, he was original in attitude and humour and there was not better actor to play this role. <br/><br/>I found that the 3D part of the film brought away the clarity of the imagery, the film was not worth the extra money for this. It is evident that Michael Bay (director) did not want the 3D aspect to distort the film, however, those of us who paid to watch it in 3D were severely disappointed.<br/><br/>I found that the end of the film was also similar to ones we have seen in many other films, a battle between ""good and bad"" is an ending which is highly predictable and unoriginal.<br/><br/>I liked the special effects in this film, but anyone who wants special effects should not be expected to pay £9 to enjoy this experience."

","I have been a big fan of the Alice books since I read them as a child. I have seen the Disney cartoon version many times and love the nonsense that i that it has in it. When I heard that Disney was doing another Alice in Wonderland, I was excited. On the day of the release I saw the movie. The 3-d was great, it gave it the surreal feel that the books had, but that was where the Alice in wonderland I loved as a child ended. The movie had very little to do with Lewis Carroll's books. The movie had the characters, they were just changed. Wonderland became Underland, the Cheshire Cat could now change into people, and the childhood dream of Alice became a dark place where Alice had to kill the Jabberwocky. It seemed that Tim Burton saw the Narnia movies and thought that he should take Alice in Wonderland and make it in that style. If the writer had taken time to read the books that Lewis Carroll wrote the movie could have been good, there was a great director, great actors, but a bad script and no heart to the movie. The Mad Hatter was good, he had the crazy feel of the character down, the March Hare was good and mad. The White Queen was awful being a woman who could not kill but could send others to kill. Where was that White Queen at in the books?<br/><br/>The graphics looked great, but looks cannot make a film great. The CG took over the story, took your attention away from the story and made you focus on what the environment looked like. I felt horrible after seeing this movie. I wanted my money back and wanted to forget the two hours I wasted on the movie. <br/><br/>I gave it three stars because of the aforementioned characters that were good. Other than that this movie was a waste of money to make and perhaps, in the future, someone will make an Alice movie that makes up for this one."
"insomniac_rod","8","1","2","14 March 2010"," Tim Burton's merit: holding the ""pieces"" of Wonderland together.
","We all know the Burton-Depp formula!. And it worked again... for what it is.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan from Burton or Depp. So when I saw the ""Alice"" posters all around the city I thought ""I'm getting tired of the same overacted, exquisite characters portrayed by Depp""; and ""this looks like the TYPICAL Tim Burton movie"".<br/><br/>So I went with my girlfriend to watch ""Alice"" on 3D and I must admit that I had a very good time with it. I was never a big fan of the Alice story and I even watched the Disney version for the last time maybe 18 years ago.<br/><br/>Tim Burton knows perfectly that the Alice story is filled with plenty of random moments, random characters, and situations. So it was a delight for him to expand all his fantasy oriented ideas on this story. He created a beautiful Wonderland where everything looks fantastic, shiny, non-sense, but also dry, dark; all inside an uncertain atmosphere.<br/><br/>But Tim Burton's ""strong feature"" is the character creation. This time he didn't fail. The Alice character is the strongest feature of the movie. He picked up a talented actress that is easy for the eye. Her dialogs, clothes, actions were very well done released. The Mad Hatter was by far the most eccentric, weird, and comical character. Nice performance by Johnny Depp who always picks weird roles. Helena Bonham Carter delivered a fine performance with black humor as the Red Queen. She was hysterical. Anne Hathaway was perfect as the ""moody"" and nice White Queen. She's always beautiful! It was nice to ""hear"" Christopher Lee. Crispin Glove was great. Tim Burton really knows how to pick ""exotic"" looking actors/actresses for his movies. The rest of the cast is displayed by CGI characters that were likable, comical, and crazy! The dogs, mice, rabbits, etc. were all nice to look at.<br/><br/>You can also expect action, humor, the typical ""sentimental"" moments (for example, when the Mad Hatter escapes from the Red Queen's castle and returns to the White Queen's territory, walking in company of Alice's ""allies"". <br/><br/>The plot isn't exactly complex and it's filled with random situations. Some examples include The Mad Hatter's dancing. I rest my case. Still, it was a very easy to follow story where you just need to relax and enjoy the amazing atmosphere and crazy situations. This is an entertaining movie that doesn't tries to be more than that.<br/><br/>There's plenty of black humor in all kinds of situations. When there's tension, danger, etc. The black humor was top notch and greatly displayed by the Mad Hatter and the Red Queen.<br/><br/>The CGI and Art Direction is simply spectacular. Wonderland never looked this amazing. I enjoyed every single setting and characters. Burton knew how to get the best from the film's budget.<br/><br/>Tim Burton HAD to do this movie. The result is an entertaining film experience. Nothing more, nothing less. But it should please the fans of the story.<br/><br/>The score was just decent. Nothing spectacular. Avril Lavigne's ""Alice"" song fit perfectly after the ending. Nice.<br/><br/>I enjoyed my visit to Wonderland. Well, 99% of the time mainly because a crying baby ruined the last 5 minutes of the movie (after the monster beheading). My advice would be: don't bring little kids to the movie on 3D. Some scenes may be too scary for them and annoying for the rest of the audience!"
"ferreiragon","4","1","2","14 March 2010"," It should have been called ""Return to wonderland""
","Usually, I like quite a lot the Burton/Depp partnership work. I have to say though, that this movie its quite poor regarding the script and also the characters. Its about a re experience of Alice in Wonderland when she is 20 years old and about getting a proposition to get married. Revisiting wonderland, all the original characters from Alice in Wonderland and Through the glass mirror reappear, taking action in a somehow similar way as Alice in Wonderland. It adapts many ideas from the original book but some are done right and others are simply stunning surreal images with a plot that has no creativity at all, when compared to other children alike movies. The only thing that saves it are the parts that are like an extraction from the original Carroll's books. It usually lacks the logic plays, the absurd humor and the astonishment of another world, that could be the grown ups world metaphorically speaking, but from the perspective of a child. The music id from the famous Danny Elfman from the Simpsons and it doesn't fail. Though somehow overplayed, the best performances from the cast are Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. In summary, If you are looking for visuals and nothing deep go see it. If you are looking for a good script and witty conversation, a good adaptation from Carroll's masterpieces, you will be disappointed."
"tburke85","7","2","7","19 June 2010"," Alice In Wonderland A Decent Re-Imagining Of A Classic Tale
","Alice In Wonderland is a decent re-imaging of a class tale from director Tim Burton who does a good job of making this movie that might have flaws but I still enjoyed it for what the film was. Johnny Depp of course is excellent as always giving audiences a much different Mad Hatter than we've seen before. He's nearly unrecognizable under all the make up and the voice Depp came up with is fitting for this interpretation of the Mad Hatter. Depp brings his usual charisma to the part and his character may not appear for the first 30 minutes but luckily he's in it a lot more after that. Depp continues to show audiences and critics his talent as an actor in this one. Anne Hathaway is all right in her short screen time as The White Queen despite not having a whole lot to do. Hathaway does provide a little comic relief and she brings what she can to her small role in the film. Helena Bonham Carter is effective as the villainous Red Queen who seems to enjoy saying ""Off with their head"" when someone displeases her for any reason. Carter like Hathaway offers the film some humor and does what her roles requires. Crispin Glover is decent as The Red Queen's right hand man Stayne who likes big woman. He did seem to go a little over the top at times but Glover still turns in an okay performance. Newcomer Mia Wasikowska is impressive as 19 year old Alice who returns to the magical world from her childhood adventure. She holds her own against Depp, Hathaway, and Carter on screen in their scenes together. Wasikowski proves her talent as an actress with her performance as Alice who must find the strength within herself to put an end to the Red Queen's reign that has left a large portion of the imaginary world of Wonderland in ruins. The voice talents of Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Alan Rickman, Matt Lucas, and Timothy Spall are effective in their small roles that are more like cameos and extended appearances but they do what their roles require from them. Marton Csokas in a blink and you missed it cameo does what he can with his very brief part as Alice's father Charles. The rest of the relatively unknown cast are okay but no one stands out. The action which mostly happens in the second half and third act are well executed. The special effects are quite good even if you can tell most of it is obviously CGI. The world they created for the magical Wonderland however is just as impressive giving audiences a world where almost anything's possible. The pacing of the film was a little slow at times before the action started to kick into high gear, and some characters lacked development but there wasn't a whole lot I didn't enjoy about Alice In Wonderland. The second half set the stage for some action in the third act (the kind we've seen in Transformers, Iron Man, and X-Men 3 to name a few) which isn't necessarily a bad thing I guess because it's well executed. Overall Alice In Wonderland is a pretty good re-imaging of a famous tale that was better than expected. So if this sounds like a movie you'd enjoy, than chances are you'll have a good time watching it. Alice in Wonderland has a simple story, drama, action, some humor, a little suspense, and solid performances by the cast (especially Depp and Wasikowska) who make this movie worth the time to watch."

","Once again my favourite filmmaker of all time shows me his skills and I am thoroughly impressed Most don't like, I absolutely love it I find this film to be a fantastic companion piece to the Disney cartoon. I can't wait to watch it with the original back to back. I believe I'm gonna have a blast I believe the dialogue suits the situation and I thought all the performances were fantastic. I always hope Tim Burton would do Alice in Wonderland and then he did, and as I was looking forward to it I started to worry that the original wouldn't mean as much to me To my surprise, because it was different it was completely unpredicatable and I love it. Heck I love everything that Tim Burton has done.<br/><br/>I look forward to buying the DVD and adoring it forever"
"ManWithGoodTaste","10","2","7","26 March 2010"," An incredible film, hands down.
","I have seen this... wonderful creation, and let me tell you how wonderful it is!<br/><br/>First of all, the story. The original books were known for having absolutely no logic, and, at the same time, being very gripping. Same thing here. The plot is... very strange to say the least... but it only does the film good! It actually does have a message buried deep under a huge pile of nonsense, but you won't get it right away. Anyway, whoever wrote the screenplay managed to create a worthy sequel to the original books.<br/><br/>Second, the acting. I would NOT talk about Johnny Depp, who's performance is great as always. Every actor and voice actor (the various creatures found in the film) do their jobs wonderfully. There isn't any bad line (or badly delivered one) in the movie. The dialog is superb.<br/><br/>Third, the visuals. Today every big budget fantasy film ought to have great effects, so it is pointless to say which film is better based on them. To me, special effects are boring if they are there just to show off the big budget. But here, they are used creatively. Take one effect out of the scene and... the magic will be gone. This is one of those rare cases when effects play a part in the story alongside the characters.<br/><br/>Conclusion - Tim Burton has done it again. Don't go and see Avatar, see Alice in Wonderland!!!~!!!"
"MaxBorg89","8","2","7","11 March 2010"," A little trip to Burtonland
","Perhaps more than any other Tim Burton project, his ""reimagining"" of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland was anticipated with a healthy mix of excitement and preoccupation: on the one hand, Carroll's wonderfully bewildering literary universe is perfect for Burton's visionary quirks, and it also marks a welcome return to more ""audience-friendly"" features after the magnificently gory Sweeney Todd; on the other, the fact that the director's former employee, Disney (already famously associated with Alice in the past), with whom his professional relationship has been a bit unpleasant to say the least (he got sacked after making Frankenweenie because his vision was too ""unconventional""), had a hand in the project, it was reasonable to suspect the House of Mouse would impose certain restrictions on Burton's creative decisions. Luckily, as it turns out, he walked out of that ""battle"" mostly unscathed.<br/><br/>Mixing Carroll's original novel and its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass, Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton (of Beauty and the Beast fame) distance themselves from previous adaptations by depicting Alice not as a child, but as a 19-year old girl (played by In Treatment's Mia Wasikowska). Bored by the high society life of 19th century England, she notices the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen) at a party and follows him. She finds a hole, falls into it and ends up in Wonderland, or, as the locals call it, Underland. There she reunites with old friends like the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) and the smoking Caterpillar (Alan Rickman), all of whom tell her she is meant to defeat the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), according to a prophecy. Only problem is, Alice has no recollection whatsoever of her past experiences in Underland...<br/><br/>The key difference between this Alice and other ones, aside from the character's age, is Burton's decision to turn Carroll's prose into a coherent movie plot, rather than a string of disjointed episodes. This is, at once, an asset but also the film's main weakness (aside from the gratuitous use of 3D, which isn't very surprising since it was added after filing had wrapped): although it allows for proper character arcs (the script's insistence on giving the Hatter a solid back-story explains why Depp is the first actor billed in the credits, aside from his bankability), it also means the movie slips into a formulaic dead end during the third act which, while fun, is a clear sign of Disney's wish to end the picture in a Harry Potter-like fashion (the comparison is also justified by the coincidence of having four Potter alumni in the cast).<br/><br/>From any other standpoint, however, the film is a joy to behold: despite the PG rating (for ""fantasy action/violence"" and, hilariously, ""a smoking caterpillar""), Burton gets to go anywhere he wants with his visual inventiveness, delivering a spellbinding world (part real sets, part CGI, all gorgeous) that is enthralling and creepy at the same time: how many movies ""for kids"" feature a scene where the heroine has to walk past a bunch of severed heads? Also, in true Burton fashion, the characters are a delightful group of freaks, and the actors obviously enjoy playing them: the blatant show-stealing turns come from Burton faithfuls Depp and Bonham Carter, the former being loony yet affecting, the latter entertaining but also truly evil. Wasikowska, playing the ""straight"" role, confirms her status as a young talent to watch, while other live-action treats come from Anne Hathaway and the villainous Crispin Glover. As for the voice talent, it's as good as one should expect when people like Rickman, Sheen, Timothy Spall and Christopher Lee are involved.<br/><br/>In short, for all its flaws, Alice in Wonderland remains a pleasant experience. It may not qualify as essential Burton, but it's still a lot better than his take on Planet of the Apes."
"MadHatter21","7","2","7","10 March 2010"," Carroll's World Comes to Life
","The eight year old inside of me felt it necessary to re-read Lewis Carroll's books before sitting down to watch ALICE IN WONDERLAND. While I finished my reading believing the story to be precious more than nonsense, I also found myself in a state of curiosity. What did a Bandersnatch look like? Just how loony was The March Hare? And what did this world on the other side of the rabbit hole look like? While it might not have been the film I expected, I have to give this movie credit - it certainly gave me an experience far wilder than my own imagination.<br/><br/>Deciding what to say about ALICE IN WONDERLAND was admittedly difficult. Admittedly, I wasn't wowed by the film, but a lot of that is on me - and not the fault of the film. The movie geek in me started doing the math months ago...Alice + Burton + Depp + 3-D = Holy moly awesome! The problem is, that my tempered reaction to the film isn't really a reaction to the film, it's a reaction to expectations versus reality.<br/><br/>The reality is that we have been given a Wonderland that truly brings Lewis Carroll's imagination to life. From the lush garden of talking flowers to the regal intimidation of The Red Queen's palace, the set pieces of this film are rich with lavishness, whimsy, and indeed - wonder. Making it all the more complete are the tiny details, like the frantically flapping birds holding chandeliers aloft, and flamingo croquet mallets that apologize to the de facto ball before whacking him into play.<br/><br/>Where the set pieces leave off, the actors come in and take over. Mia Wasikowska is an understated Alice. Some have reacted by saying that she seems to play things a little *too* subtle, but I find the slightly muted delivery more befitting of a 19-year old. When Alice first goes to Wonderland, she's wide-eyed with curiosity. Befitting a girl who has had thirteen years to stew on what she thought was a dream, she wanders through this great unknown with a bit more steely temperament.<br/><br/>Alice being understated isn't such a bad thing this time around as it basically keeps her out of harm's way when she's in a scene opposite Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen or Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter. Both were characters that left me hesitant in still images, but when brought to life on the screen they thrive in this nonsensical world. Bonham Carter tears through every scene she's in with a reckless abandon, and Depp brings a nice duality to The Hatter. the temptation *must* have been great to play him like a raving loon. Happily, Depp instead plays him with a nice mix of fear and oddity. Suffice to say - he made me proud of my handle.<br/><br/>If I do have a great disappointment with the film, it's the afterthought attitude towards the 3-D rendering. It comes into play very sparingly, and really isn't utilized nearly enough in this fantastical story - one that seems like it was written for a 3-D treatment. I have mentioned on more than one occasion that 3-D is by and large a gimmick, and ALICE did nothing to change my mind. Further, it's lack of use of the technology was one thing that disappointed me.<br/><br/>In the years since I first heard this story, I've had many daydreams about what a Cheshire Cat's smile looks like, or how an army of playing cards might move. the way ALICE IN WONDERLAND brought these visions to life alone were enough for me to recommend this film. And while I will openly admit that I found the overall narrative wanting, I can forgive it for distracting me with visual delights that I have only been able to imagine since I was eight."
"thesar-2","8","2","7","8 March 2010"," Want real wonder? Skip Avatar and join Alice
","Honestly, I didn't expect I would like 2010's remake Alice in Wonderland. I did expect all FX and no story or acting, a la Avatar. Enjoying this as much as I did shows why never to judge a book by its cover. (Or other movie reviews, to be precise.) Thankfully, though, I didn't have much to base this on as I have never read any of the books and even though I wasn't a huge fan of the original animated Disney film in 1951, I haven't seen that one in a very long time to remember enough to compare this to. So, I basically went in with a clean slate and saw what Director Tim Burton wanted me to see. As usual, it was his vision.<br/><br/>I was blown away. I loved the spectacle of the Underland, the characters, the actual wonder of the film. Sure it had its flaws, but overall it's a must-see, especially in IMAX 3-D.<br/><br/>Young Alice has nightmares of a ""wonder land"" of strange characters, including a smiling cat and is comforted by her adventurous and free-spirited father. Fast-forward to ""present"" day when Alice's 19, her father's long gone and she's courted to marry someone she just met as per custom in royalty. Well, taking a lot from her father, whom meant the world to her, she becomes the Runaway Fiancé and lands into the infamous rabbit hole.<br/><br/>Much like The Chronicles of Narnia and Hook combined, the movie shifts to the odd characters tugging her to this place or that to eventually rid the Underland of the Red Queen by slaying her pet, as foretold by a scroll. The lesson here kids? Alice must choose her destiny and not have her destiny choose her.<br/><br/>As much as I loved the surreal and wonderful world of down-below, I did have some complaints that withdrew a full star from my rating. (Some of this might be spoilers, so you can skip two paragraphs as not to have things revealed.) #1 Why Be Like Hook? If you're gonna make a huge budgeted remake – why start with part two? Though, I did favor this tenfold over Steven Spielberg's Hook, in a sense, they were the same movie. Older Alice/Peter inadvertently gets thrown back into their retrospective ""adventure lands"" and take almost the ENTIRE movie to remember who they are – despite every character shouting at them all the way who they really are. I would've preferred a retelling of the original classic, Alice's first adventure to Wonderland.<br/><br/>#2 The Chronicle of Narnia's Final Battle seemed forced. Yes, it was foretold, but it seemed like it was just there to mimic Disney's other (unfortunately, failing) franchise. In addition, following was a pretty lame attempt at The Wizard of Oz's conclusion. Perhaps that was part of the book that I missed, but not only did Alice barely change throughout the movie, when she reentered the human world after realizing this was not but a dream, it was as if nothing happened. She shared Dorothy from Oz's sentiments, but lacked the true emotion.<br/><br/>Those said, I liked all the characters and was thrilled they weren't what my own expectations of them to be, i.e. they kept throwing my visions of who they were supposed to be out the window. I liked to be surprised. Despite the previously mention finale, Alice (Wasikowska) did a wonderful job, Mad Hatter (Depp) was good as, again, I expected Willy Wonka and he most certainly created a new character and Red Queen (Carter) was great at being bad, very bad. The twins, or Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Lucas) were two of my favorites in adding humor and Cheshire Car (Fry) was awesome as was the White Rabbit (Sheen.) The only ones I didn't care much for were the White Queen (Hathaway) and Stayne (Glover) for Hathaway didn't sway too far from her other established characters and Stayne was the only graphic I didn't buy throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>This brings me to another point. As everyone's still googly-eyed over the ""spectacle"" of Avatar, I found the entire Alice in Wonderland to be so much more believable in graphics, characters and background than even five minutes of Avatar. All except for the too-tall character of Stayne. Luckily, though an important character that does appear for just under half the feature, he doesn't dominate the screen for 90% of the movie like those laughably unrealistic blue smurfs (Na'vi .) Seriously, I never thought for a moment they weren't in Wonderland, or Underland, but I had a huge problem buying the goofy Na'vi and that turned me off for nearly all of Avatar.<br/><br/>At any rate, I would thoroughly recommend the wonder of Wonderland. Everyone seemed to have a good time (in the film, that is) and it's nice and tight, quick and to the point. It gives you what you came for, just the right amount and didn't make you yearn for more. Though I would still see a sequel – pending all parties involved here return, I really wouldn't want one. I liked how this pretty much summed it up, and in spades. Or is thathearts?"
"Red_Identity","Null","2","7","7 March 2010"," Tim Burton's Alice is a Visual Masterpiece
","Let me start off here... Tim Burton's Alice could have been a true classic, but instead it is just a good, sometimes very good, visually- amazing film. I do get the mixed reviews, since it is FAR from perfect. First off, I thought the first 10 minutes with Alice in the family gathering in the garden was truly dull and mediocre. I was thinking if this was the way the whole film was going to be I would hate it. Thankfully, once she steps into the rabbit hole, it went uphill. We visit Tim Burton's reimagining of Wonderland, or in this case, Underland. It is amazing. The colors, the artistic settings and the extraordinary costumes, make-up, and visual effects make this a true enchanting place. The film also has some really good scenes, most notably the scene where she is trying to open the small door when she first gets in, and her meeting with the Mad Hatter at his dinner table. Scenes like those really make this a magical film, and for the first 2/3 of her stay in Underland, it is really good, but it then starts to get a bit messy with the plot of her having to finally slay the dragon. I thought the final battle sequence, although visually amazing, was so dull and lost my complete interest. Tim Burton had said that since he had never been emotionally connected with the original plot-less structure of the book and Disney film, he wanted to make this film have an actual purpose, which I think is it's downfall, not only because the actual plot turns out to be so clichéd, but because what I think made the original so great is how it has no clear plot and Alice goes wandering from place to place in Wonderland. The performances are great. Mia Wasikowska really holds her own, while Johnny Depp is also surprisingly tolerable as the Mad Hatter. But I think Helena Bonham Carter once again upstages Depp (the first time being in Sweeney Todd) and created a very memorable and funny Red Queen. I thought she was wonderful. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is not the masterpiece it could have been, but its not as bad as some say it is. I did enjoy it for the most part, and the performances and the vibrant world Burton has created demands a view, if just for the amazing visuals. I really hope this is a frontrunner for the Make-Up, Costumes, and Art Direction Oscars next year."

","If you've seen the trailer then you know Johnny Depp looks really cool as the Hatter. You know that the Red Queen has a big funny head and likes to say ""off with his head!"" a whole lot. And then.........ummmm....well, that's about the entire movie. It's just a very mediocre, run-of-the-mill fantasy yarn that disappoints on many levels. I think everyone expected quite a bit from Tim Burton, but I was left pretty empty. The movie was so bland and uninteresting that I'm having difficulty writing a decent 10-line review. It all just struck me as a lame ""Narnia' knock-off. Definitely one of Tim's most forgettable efforts."

","Though it is quite a bit more colorful then most of his previous movies, Tim Burton has created yet another masterpiece.<br/><br/>Working at a theater, I have heard from a handful of people that this movie was dull and uneventful. That could not be farther from the truth. Though it may not be as good as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Edward Scissorhands, there was still a wonderful storyline and magnificent visual effects. Burton also did a great job of working in a lot more of Lewis Carroll's stories, including the Bandersnatch, the Jabberwocky, and lines from Carroll's writings.<br/><br/>Though it wasn't his best work, it was still great. I give this move an 8 out of 10."

","I'll be short. This is going to be biggest disappointment of 2010. Ugly 3D makes your eyes red, story is naive and stupid and actor plays pretty bad as well (even J. Depp). There is some good moments like adorable Cheshire Cat and some other creatures but Tim Burton were unable to combine these good pieces into a good movie.<br/><br/>As a movie for children this one fails as well because there much ""adult"" scenes like naked 20 y.o. Alice or a ditch full of decapitated heads.<br/><br/>Looks like a grim era began since most of movies will try to have 3D version to copy Avatar success.

I really hated how they disfigured the Mad Hatter. And it's not Johnny Depp (he actually makes it entertaining) it's the screenplay. This movie (this sequel) has very little to do with the books, and even with Disney's cartoon adaptation. Yes, it has all the original characters and situations, but the characters appear almost all together, with no sense of pace, and some of them are completely wrong (Mad Hatter, oh my god what was that!, the Dormouse...). And the situations were changed to get some nice screenplay to make a movie for people just wanting to hang there, eat pop corn and have some fun. I did like the vibe of the Cheshire Cat, the Red Queen, and, at the beginning, the Blue Caterpillar.<br/><br/>So... I didn't like the movie. It's not bad at all, it's entertaining but... you know. It's just another movie. I think Burton made a big mistake here. It could've been magical if he just used the original book. It could have been something to remember; but we will all just forget.

","Tim Burton remake of Alice in Wonderland is a modern twist to the classic version. Alice, played by Mia Wasikowska, is now nineteen and returns to Wonderland where things are completely different and full of heart rushing adventure. Although there is a different plot from the original, Alice is joined by her old friend to help her save Wonderland from the Red Queen played by Helena Carter. In this 3-D version, Alice is expected to accept a marriage proposal but she runs off and sees a rabbit that follows down a hole that takes her to Wonderland.<br/><br/>Entering into Wonderland, Alice is met by her old friends like to Dormouse (Barbara Windsor), White Rabbit (Michael Sheen), Tweedledee & Tweedledum (Matt Lucas), The Mad Hatter (Brad Pitt), and Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), who all informs Alice that the Red Queen has taken over Wonderland and they were told that one day she would come back and slay the Jabberwocky and return the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) to rule. Thinking she is dreaming, Alice is willing to help the White Queen defeat the Red Queen so she can return home.<br/><br/>This is an enjoyable film yet it does contain more violence than the original as the Red Queen is subject to cutting off heads. The colorful settings and the weird creatures comes alive as they are displayed in life like features. Yet some of the familiar scenes bring back the childhood memories of the original movie. Familiar character Cheshire Cat still shows to disappear in his mischief way while the Mad Hatter brings more laughter as he does his Jabberwocky dance.<br/><br/>Over all this movie deserves a five star because the Mia Wasikowska, Helena Carter, Johnny Depp, and others great performance and created a terrific movie that is enjoyable to watch. Even though it is not what we would expect from the original, it was defiantly not a letdown. Compared to other films of Burton such as Edward Scissorhands, this movie hit the top as one of his best directed films. It leaves you with the curiosity to see what he has planned next. 3-D is the best way to see this movie and I highly recommend the purchase of the DVD to add to the collection of movies to be watched over and over again."
"piratecannon","8","1","3","26 December 2012"," Follow the White Rabbit
","If there's anyone who could ably bring Lewis Carroll's vision of Alice in Wonderland to the silver screen, it'd certainly be Tim Burton. Of course, one would expect a director best known for injecting the macabre (in one form or another) into his films to do the same here. In that sense Burton doesn't disappoint, as his version of Wonderland contains rivers of blood that are filled with severed heads and potions that are comprised of detached digits.As gory as it sounds, much of this is done in a slightly more subtle manner than might be expected, and it nicely compliments the surreal nature of this somewhat abstract environment.<br/><br/>But let's back up for a minute. This isn't Alice in Wonderland as you and I know it. I'm not all that familiar with Through the Looking Glass, but—in my estimation—this movie exists as sort of a pseudo-sequel that finds Alice being summoned in order to slay the legendary Jabberwocky and, by doing so, free Wonderland of the tyranny it's suffered under the rule of the Red Queen. What's odd, though, is that Alice has absolutely no recollection of her previous adventure. The reason for her amnesia isn't clearly explained, but one can surmise that it's directly connected to what she's experienced in the ""real world""— the one you and I are familiar with, and the locale that the film opens in. On her way to a shindig that's being hosted by English nobility, it's revealed that Alice is expected to accept a marriage proposal from a young man who's been groomed as a Lord. He's wealthy and well- respected, and everyone has informed the now twenty-something that it's only logical that she become a wife while her youthful beauty persists. She, of course, is skeptical of all this, and, upon being proposed to, darts from the scene. It's not long before she's tumbling down the mystical rabbit hole of lore, and the rest—as they say—is history.<br/><br/>What I particularly enjoyed about Burton's approach to Wonderland is the symbolism implicit in many of the characters. When we see Tweedledee and Tweedledum, for example, it's clear that they're meant to represent Faith and Fiona (two young ladies from the pre-rabbit-hole existence who implore Alice to accept Lord Ascot's proposal). There are several other manifestations in Wonderland that correlate with the angst Alice has experienced in her ""other"" life, and the connection is likely clear enough that children will be able to pick up on the underlying message (which, much to my dismay, is eventually spelled out for viewers). And that, of course, is that you have to choose your own path in life.<br/><br/>But really, people will see Alice in Wonderland for its decidedly unusual visuals. As previously mentioned, Burton manages to successfully blend his own taste for the twisted with the quirky universe that Carroll has crafted in his Wonderland series. There are talking frogs and bloodhounds, a caterpillar with a hookah (expertly voiced by Alan Rickman), and a demonic iteration of the Jabberwocky that's reminiscent of the dragon found in Sleeping Beauty. All in all, Wonderland is brought to life in exquisite detail.<br/><br/>I've heard complaints that the finale of the film is too Narnia-esque in its aspirations, but, from everything I experienced leading up to the battle that takes place on a giant chessboard, it felt every bit as epic as its scale implied (which actually isn't all that epic, but just epic enough). If anything was out of place in the movie, it was the shockingly stupid dance performed by the Mad Hatter (Depp) in the final minutes. It's not often that a five second shot is enough to ruin the tone of an entire movie, but this scene was so ridiculous that one could feel the entire theater cringe with embarrassment. Yes—it's that bad.<br/><br/>Bad-Elaine-Benes-dances aside, this is a wonderfully imaginative movie that's got just the right amount of subtext for the kiddies. There are times where it's likely too dark for especially sensitive viewers, but most of the children present at the screening I attended were giggling and marveling for the bulk of the 108 minute runtime. And that, in and of itself, is quite an accomplishment."

The dark and light contrasting colors are quite striking. Seeing Wonderland at first was in fact beautiful to look at.

All other characters were minimal to little character development.<br/><br/>What was the strength and weakness of the film was the visual atmosphere, after a while in Wonderland, it wears thin the computer generated at time can be noticeable such as the dragon.

"itamarscomix","4","1","3","23 September 2011"," An insult to Lewis Carroll's vision
","I almost don't want to review this movie, because I love Tim Burton and I hope he'll realize the error of this project and be back on track for the next one, the way he did after the horrendous Planet of the Apes (and no, Alice isn't quite as bad as that one, but that's not saying much). Having been accustomed to being disappointed by literary film adaptations, I came in with low expectations, and still I was disappointed.<br/><br/>What bothered me most as a Lewis Carroll fan was not the changes made to the storyline as much as the changes made to the spirit and the atmosphere. Amy Biancolli phrased it perfectly - ""Its single biggest failing... is the fact that it makes sense"". The film betrays everything that was magical and fascinating about Carroll's nonsense and whim, turning it into a clone of Narnia or the Neverending Story. The Mad Hatter -- a tortured soul turned to madness by evil and horror? Seriously? That's almost as bad as turning the poem of the Jabberwocky - a masterpiece of language and nonsense - into an ominous prophecy. 'Underland'? Please. The characters are Carroll's, but Carroll's vision is gone.<br/><br/>Not that the film doesn't have a few things going for it. The casting is near perfect, and it could have made a solid Alice film. Helena Bonham Carter, Matt Lucas, Stephen Fry, Alan Rickman, Michael Sheen, Crispin Glover, Timothy Spall - they all do a commendable job. Johnny Depp's Hatter was awful but it wasn't his fault - he was merely doing his Willy Wonka over again. Mia Wasikowska does a good job, even if any connection to Carroll's Alice is purely coincidental. Costume design and art direction are as good as you'd expect from Burton, but hardly groundbreaking.<br/><br/>As for the 3D, it does very little to help the film along. I do hope that Burton has learned his lesson - that 3D is no replacement for filmmaking (although sadly, seeing how successful Alice was, it may be that he won't learn that lesson). If Avatar hasn't driven the message home, then Alice should be a wake-up call to anyone of the James Cameron school of thought, who will realize that 3D cinema is a gimmick, a fun one, but definitely not the next stage in filmmaking, at least not until somebody did anything worthwhile with it, and so far I haven't seen that happen."

","Thirteen years after falling down the rabbit hole and encountering a feast of frenzied creatures, a troubled young woman in Victorian England makes the same journey after following the same White Rabbit--but she doesn't remember what lies in store for her. Lewis Carroll's books ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"" are once again fancifully realized on film, however Linda Woolverton's screenplay--with the regrettable emphasis placed upon Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter--is haphazardly lumped together. Mia Wasikowska's Alice doesn't recognize anyone in Wonderland/Underland, but we have already heard her describe the characters she has seen in her recurring dreams. Worse, the irascible Red Queen had just about torched everything which surrounds her castle, giving Wonderland a post-apocalyptic look which is visually depressing. Depp's Mad Hatter is turned into a modern variation of Ray Bolger's Scarecrow from ""The Wizard Of Oz""--complete with a sentimental attachment to Alice--however Helena Bonham Carter's bulbous-headed Red Queen is a masterful achievement of character acting (she steals the film). Tim Burton directed, but, while his playfully twisted sense of humor is in evidence, he has no feelings for Alice, nor many of the famous Carroll eccentrics she encounters. There's a fatigued sense of storytelling at play here; the grand production, ornate and expensive, begins to seem overbaked, while the final tag--Alice leading a trade expedition to China!--is certainly not in keeping with Carroll's creation. ** from ****"

","This movie had good visuals true but as Avatar or the Transformers movies have shown visuals do not make a movie you need 3 dimensional, interesting characters and a well written plot this movie had none of those it was dull. Another thing what is Tim Burton's fetish with Johnny Deep and Helena Bonham Carter he has cast them in most of his resent movies. The Visuals were great but one thing i didn't understand was why did they make The Queen Of Hearts And Tweedledee and Tweedledum CGI and Alice, White Queen and others were real people? That confused me a lot, These are just a few of the reasons the movie just didn't work. One scene that annoyed me a lot was when the mad hatter was about about to be beheaded and it turns out that it was the Cheshire Cat disguised as him that scene was cool and all but wait why didn't they use the Cheshire cat more often that like the master of disguised why did they send in the other to be spies when they could have used the disguised. Then the there was the Futterwacken... It was one of the Worst Movie scenes I have ever seen when i was watching that movie after the scene was over i was literally speechless from its awfulness. I give it 2/10 this movie was just terrible i would recommend you watch one of Tim Burton's good movies instead"

Also the performances and the music were pretty good, making the whole thing enjoyable and charming.<br/><br/>""Alice in Wonderland"" was a good film. It wasn't a masterpiece like ""Big Fish"", but it still was a pretty good movie for the whole family.

"jmalin7-1","5","1","3","27 November 2010"," Infuriating
","This is a disappointing adaptation of two strange, mysterious, and under-appreciated books.<br/><br/>I accept film adaptations, and sometimes welcome them. For example, I thought that the film adaptation of ""The Hunt for Red October"" was much better than the book, with tighter action and no plot holes. I welcomed all the Harry Potter film adaptations. Sometimes an imaginary world demands to be put before our eyes.<br/><br/>I am also infuriated by poor film adaptations. They do the original material an injustice, they fail all the more because they don't rise even to the level of the original, much less go past it. This is why, for example, I think the Wizard of Oz is only so-so. It is a ""beloved film"", but it falls short of the original book, which most people have forgotten.<br/><br/>It's the same problem with every treatment of Alice In Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass that's been made so far, including Tim Burton's. Both ""Oz"" and ""Alice"" are fantasies from a different age, and so presenting them to a modern audience takes an extra bit of work. Unfortunately, both the makers of ""Oz"" and the makers of ""Alice"" were lazy. Instead of taking the work as it was, they had re-tell it as their own story.<br/><br/>Fair enough, but then if you do that, don't use the title of the original work. Don't pretend that you've captured the original if you haven't.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's ""Alice"" doesn't capture the original. It's completely anachronistic and unrealistic for the time in which the story is set, and the entire movie ignores all of the mystery and subtlety of the books, preferring instead to teach ""lessons"" that Dodgson might have preached but Carroll would have avoided. The whole charm of the books is that they *don't* teach lessons. They explore the mysteries of meaning, they ask questions without answers. They are not examples of ""being true to oneself"", they're explorations of going out into the boundaries of perception and madness. Unfortunately, while Tim Burton's art is capable of this, his works are trite and unadventurous."
"RNHunter","10","1","3","21 November 2010"," Exceptional
","Well, there are always going to be different opinions on some movies, but I found this movie quite exceptional - and also something of a breakthrough. It is hard to give a simple reason why - since I see it as a composite of things well done. If one considers the whole movie an art form, like a painting, it is just that I found the whole setting remarkably pleasing. The human acting portion, the amazing CGI that combined with real humans, the coloring, the incredible design of the red queen and the mad hatter, and of course the smile of Johny Depp which seems no one on the planet can duplicate or even tell if it is friendly or not. (smiles). All together, I find it casts an image that I have not seen before this time. It is fantasy at its best, done by the best.<br/><br/>And I would call it a breakthrough movie. One could credit the movie the Wizard of Oz with bringing us color, since it began in black and white and then switched to color, even if it was not the sole color movie of its time. And then there was Jurassic Park, which to me was far more than a movie, but the coming of age of CGI where it had matured to appear to be real - and could even describe a history of creatures we had never before seen. And of course during those years, some movies had real humans as always, and some were total animation and some had a combination of the two. But to me, the way that this Alice in Wonderland movie combines CGI with humans to create the Red Queen, to create Tweedledee and Tweedledum as composite humans and CGI with exceptional creativity, I believe takes us to a new level. Now fantasy can be combinations of the real and imaginary - perhaps as our dreams really are."
"thomvic","7","1","3","7 November 2010"," Visually fantastic
","I haven't read the original story, and to be honest I didn't really understand the whole point of the story in the first place. Especially after watching the Disney cartoon, it sort of left me a bit bewildered.<br/><br/>However, in this version, I am happy to say it is an enjoyable movie, which looks great visually with some good performances in particular from Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. Mia Wasikowska as Alice is very likable and the fact that she is a lot older in this version (which explains itself later on in the film) and is not so much as a damsel in distress figure makes it more enjoyable to take this journey alongside her.<br/><br/>The changes to the original story didn't bother me that much. I thought this was an interesting take on the tale and it actually added a bit more substance to what is a slightly meaningless tale in the beginning anyway. Johnny Depp's character as the Mad Hatter is good, though I liked him better in other movies. But it really is Helena Bonham Carter who lights this up as the villainous queen. She steals the show with her spineless and cold character.<br/><br/>I did find the ending battle a bit somewhat anti climatic, but I think it doesn't really matter since this isn't a film about battles and major war (thought it sometimes tries to be) but more about the beauty of a new world and how you can learn things from it, even though it is quite confusing.<br/><br/>This made more than a billion at the box office - wow I'm surprised! Not because I think it's a bad film, but I didn't realise this story had such an impact on so many people.<br/><br/>This is a much more darker version on this tale, though I don't think it is dark enough to scare young kids, though they may be a little frightened of some scenes. I think adults will also enjoy this, though those looking for a faithful adaptation of the original story will probably have to get used to the new ideas, but it is imaginative nevertheless.<br/><br/>Worth to see for the performances and the visuals. Story - hmmm..well it's in my opinion a higher notch above the original story, but nothing majorly spectacular."
"funkyfry","4","1","3","18 October 2010"," Boring
","Just saw this one finally, wasn't too impressed. Of course everybody here on IMDb except Burton fans said it was terrible, and the Burton fans said ""best movie yet."" Of course. So I can't really go off that. I just have to eventually see the movie because I have some faith in Burton. I thought he was really going downhill in the late 90s when he did ""Sleepy Hollow"" and the horrendous ""Planet of the Apes"", so I didn't see ""Big Fish"" until years later. Then when I saw it, I realized how stupid I was to give up on Burton because all in all it's a wonderful movie, just as good as his early films. So then my faith in him is totally restored, I'm beating myself up for having so little patience to give up on a director I know is kind of special just because he did one mediocre movie and one horrible movie, so I start seeing his movies again. And since then, only ""Sweeney Todd"" was really worth seeing, and that was just barely worth seeing.<br/><br/>So I'm thinking about giving up on him again.<br/><br/>Oh, not a horrible movie like ""Planet of the Apes"" -- that would almost give me hope that there could be another breakthrough on the horizon. If anything, Burton must have realized that he screwed up with that movie and he went and did a more interesting project. But if he keeps making really average movies like ""Alice"" and ""Wonka"" and the audience keeps going, then he's got no incentive to improve.<br/><br/>The movie is just sort of there in front of you. There are too many precious scenes, too much intricate scenery that doesn't add up to a pleasing whole. You sit there looking at the details like the little nuances of Johnny Depp's weird costume and you end up not seeing half the movie. Tim Burton's action scenes have never seemed all that great to me. And that poor actress, he really leaned on her a lot and didn't protect her. It would have been a miracle if she had actually pulled it off. Crispin Glover, I thought at least he would be really good or really bad, but I'm indifferent to his performance here. It's not funny and it's not scary but it's not annoying. Depp has a few nice moments. At least his character here is more likable than in the Wonka movie. Although at some point I'd like to see Depp play a character for Burton who's not an eccentric. Make a movie where all the characters are weird but Johnny Depp is normal. Now that would be something different for Burton. This is just more of the same. He got the best performance out of his wife Bonham-Carter, although there were so many effects that it's difficult to say what's really her.<br/><br/>There is no summing it up. The movie ends (SPOILERS) with a big, not particularly interesting, battle. And then Johnny Depp does an awful dance to the worst song Danny Elfman has written since he was in Oingo Boingo. There were a lot of things in the movie like that which were obviously supposed to be funny but my gal and I were at best amused, not ever laughing. I think I chuckled one time at the Red Queen slapping Crispin Glover around, but that's pretty pathetic laugh-o-meter for a movie that was at least supposed to be 30% comedy. I kept thinking how Terry Gilliam made a funnier movie with a scarier Jabberwocky for like fifty bucks back in the 70s. Everything in this movie is basically you're looking at things happening, you never really feel caught up in it or like there's any real danger. The movie finally ends with a bunch of obligatory women's-lib-in-19th Century nonsense to wrap up the framing device which apparently we're also supposed to care about, and then probably the worst pop song I've heard in a decade comes on the soundtrack. ""You can't make me stop"" she's singing, or something like that. Oh it's as easy at home as pressing a button, but I guess in the theater these function to empty the room so the ushers can sweep up the popcorn and get ready for another bunch of suckers."

I was reminded of what a pleasure the book affords, all light cleverness and the joy of word games. None of the heaviness that makes the movie so slow-going.<br/><br/>Lewis Caroll may well have had his dark side, but it would take someone with a twisted mind and a Ph.D. in English from Yale or Duke to find it in this text.<br/><br/>Skip this movie and spend the afternoon reading the book.

","Hugely anticipated movie of 2010. But My hopes were crushed within halfway into the movie.<br/><br/>Alice in wonderland is about a adolescent Alice, who twirls down the rabbit hole once again. At first the story seems to be following on the path of the actual book. But It turns in to a adventure story revolving around Alice who turns out to be a knight in shining armor. All happy ending aside, I think it's rather bull.<br/><br/>I haven't read the actual book by Lewis carol actually. But I know the story line of Alice in wonderland by watching some versions of it on TV. Once I watched a boring musical version and later I saw a kind of a long movie version which was actually quite good. The real story is really enchanting. It has all the weird aspects a dream should have. Actually Lewis Carol is a genius for a coming up with such a story of wonder and imagination so long ago. Alice in wonderland has been referred in many books and movies which involves imagination and realization like The Matrix. And one would say if a movie is made about Alice no other director would suit more than Tim Burton who came up with similar masterpieces like Sweeny Todd, Edward Scissorhands (Haven't watched it yet) and the corpse bride. No wonder this was so much anticipated. And it is a wonder that this movie got so much screwed up.<br/><br/>First why did the screenwriter attempt such child's play with the brilliant seed story. She had completely screwed it up and made it to something worthless like The Chronicles of Narnia. The CGI looks quite convincing but even the makers has screwed up that also in creating the tall character of Stayne. He looks so twitchy. The dialogs and the writing is most to blame. There's no chemistry between dialogs or between characters and scenes, also no magic, no wonder and no flow, as previous Tim Burton pieces had. Instead they are so mediocre and empty. And why is the character of the mad hatter so screwed up? Instead of being MAD and frankly awesome, he acts as an annoying, dramatic and thoughtful SOB that got on my nerves so much. (Shame on Johnny Depp!). <br/><br/>Really the renowned cast would be capable of a better job. At least the heroine, although being so weary eyed, makes a good impression. (Or maybe it's just the wardrobe of her.) 'scoffs' <br/><br/>Finally It all finishes off with a lame song which really sums up the movie : Total failure."

","When Tim Burton came out with his take on the classic kid's story Alice In Wonderland, very few people wondered if it could do wonders at the box office. It did. In big numbers. The results are mixed. While the CGI and settings of the film are pretty good, the plot becomes more darker and unsuitable for young kids who might find this movie to be too scary. They're right. Unlike what Burton did with the Willy Wonka story, Alice is a much better story. It's the best live-action Alice story ever and the newcomer who plays Alice is amazing. I saw it in 2D since they made it look 3D after filming was done. To date, this movie is Tim Burton's most popular ever, beating out Batman. A family classic."

So today I watch it since my father rented it on DVD a day ago (after all my sister said it was just average so what can I say and she's sixteen.) So after watching this supposed to be flop, I was absolutely shocked!! Turns out that the flack this film got was just flock because this has got to be the most amazing thing I've seen since well any live action film from Disney ( Prince of Persia doesn't count). Not only is it a nifty story but its what shall I say people don't have anymore? ORIGINALITY!!!! I mean come on 3-D is crap especially when you take the same image and split it in two with blurriness. If you want 3D get kicked in the face or punched in the eye. The visual art is very fascinating, the acting is amazing especially the red queen. I mean she kept yelling during the film but it matched her personality and gave the character charisma. Depp as the hatter was just creepy and spectacular. ( Why couldn't he play the joker? o well). The animals had to be on PCP or coke because man were they nut. All in All I rate this with 9( since I don't know how to put this in a 8. 9) out of 10 because Burton just puts his spin on it very well and it shows. Though I seriously recommend this to kids 12 1/2 years of age because some scenes for example (when Depp stares at one of the animals at the table and his eyes turn dark and glow or the scene when the mouse rips the cats eyeball out and runs with it on its sword like a an olive on a skewer)will cause either severe nightmares or psychological issues( I doubt).

","Let me be clear. I am in love with Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter. I want to live in their house. Perhaps in the hallway that conjoins their bedrooms. I am probably writing this review through rose coloured glasses. But I'm not a weird stalker, in case that is what you were thinking.<br/><br/>I don't really know what to say about plot of 'Alice in Wonderland'I guess 'Return to Wonderland' sums it up. Alice (Mia Watachhowdospellitowski) is now a young adult in repressed Victorian England, under pressure to wed the wonderfully wet Lord Ascot ..But she escapes from an awkward encounter down the rabbit hole, where she reunites with old friends! But unfortunately she doesn't really remember muchand Wonderland is a bit screwed.but Alice is 'THE ONE' who will bring peace! Rah rah rah.<br/><br/>So let me get the bad stuff out the waythe screenplay is not great. It does lack a certain 'something', and the script just doesn't sparkle the way it should. Lewis Carol's focus, and play, with words just isn't present in this, so enthusiasts of the source material may take offence And Mia Watachowski did have some wooden delivery AT TIMESbut she is enigmatic, with a great presence on screen. I can picture her as an artist's muse. She was memorable, and I'm sure will go on to great things.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter was nicely Mad. I think there's a general 'getting over' of Depp happening at the moment, so people haven't been too kind in their reviewsbut the Hatter was an interesting character, enhanced by brilliant design. And the interchanging accent was a nice touch. Bonham-Carter is so perfect as the Queen, but I wont begin ranting about her greatness...But the Cheshire Cat almost stole the entire film for me. It was so beautifully animated. I was mesmerised every time it appeared.<br/><br/>'Alice in Wonderland' is really all about the visualsBurton's Wonderland is enchanting. It actually went above what I would expect from Burton, visually, which is saying a lot. And for me, it was enough to lift this film above its major flaws. There was such an energy to the imagery. I saw the film in 3D, but I think no matter what mode it is viewed, the Art Direction is some of the most impressive to behold of late.<br/><br/>But as much as it pains me to bring this up, I do have to draw attention to the 'Mad Hatter' funky dance. This wasperhapsthe low point in the careers of Burton, Depp and Danny Elfman. Cringe, cringe, McCringe cringe. If you have seen the film, and are over the age of 10, you will know what I mean.<br/><br/>Basically, re-working a cult favourite like Carol's Alice, is, and was always going to be, a difficult task. I wish perhaps more time had been spent on developing a strong, unique storyline. The film could have been a masterpiece. Although a straight adaptation would have been a sure thing, I like that they took a risk. I still went quite gaga over thisand I know kids will go nuts too.<br/><br/>And Helena and Tim, if you ever read this, please contact me. I'll be your butler or something. I'll do anything."

","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp .. A big step back! Let us agree in principle that it is the film depends entirely on the visual effects .. But is this reason that the film would be weak?! .. With the knowledge that the director is Tim Burton and heroes are the stars do not differ with them all! .. Of course not justified .. The film does not have deep enough to make it on the edge of your seat and you are waiting for the recent conflict between good and evil, came the events of the film is recurrent and potentially very most of the time, lending you a sense of malaise and fatigue, and then the end will come not compensate for the time lost and you expected in the narrow end of the movie! In terms of performance representations, I believe that the role of Johnny Depp did not fit him and I felt very representative of the secondary in the film, despite the large role of the area, but I did not feel the presence of Johnny mounts the same as in other films! Anne Hathaway, also its not feel it so much! Mia Wasikowska , frankly I did not like this girl a lot in its role as Alice! Helena Bonham Carter .. Is the only one in my opinion, commendable, performed the role of the Red Queen was wonderful and fun in all times and succeeded in Helena to underestimate the many periods of boring movie and I always wait for the appearance on the screen, her performance was truly fun! We come to the visual effects and that it could be the only intercessor of the weakness of the film, but unfortunately, even visual effects did not come the required quality .. yes, effects were good but not impressive .. For example, when you see avatar marvel at the visual effects beyond the border, but in our film this good effects , but did not work on the impressed , adding to the weaknesses of the movie! In the end, if enabled those who love movies legends and myths certainly suit you this movie, but if you're a lover Johnny Depp and avid for one of his creations, you will not find in this movie, if you're a fan Burton, and one hungry for creativity you will find creativity in this film, but You'll find yourself tell you That Tim Burton has more than this to offer! .. If you love a good story and scenario arbitrator and coherent relations will not find in our film this .. If you're a fan of the movie stars and waiting to be enchanted with their performances representative in the traditional shock of them would go in this film, if you are a fan of visual effects, the film will suit you, but will not satisfy you a way that required! Therefore, I think that after the film Sweeney Todd the wonderful Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, I should say at the beginning of my comment that Alice in Wonderland was a big step back for each of the Tim Burton and Johnny Depp! .. And how much I regret saying this!"

","I saw this in 3D recently at the cinema, the 3D was great, all the ingredients were there but the story was lacking. I am not a Lewis Carol purist by any means, but I know the story like just about everyone else. It seems the film makers took random ingredients from the original and mixed them up with other fairy tales in a style that reminds me of the wonderful 10th Kingdom that I saw some years ago. Unfortunately it just doesn't work, everything is out of context, and the story failed to grasp me. The March Hare for example was mad, fine but the character had no purpose, he simply threw things about and gibbered unintelligible phrases. I know when you go to a film and have high expectations it can be disappointing but I had none but was still disappointed. The first 10 minutes of the movie seemed to show promise but once Alice gets to Underland it's all down hill. Definitely not on my recommended list."
"tomb_92","6","1","3","30 March 2010"," Very disappointing, visually impressive, but all adds up to nothing
","I had had high hopes for this film, with a cast including such stars as Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter; such treasures as Matt Lucas, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen and Alan Rickman (not to mention a cameo by Christopher Lee); and directed by Tim Burton; this really looked like one to watch. When I saw the trailer, however I was a little apprehensive. It looked too... dark? Strange? Weird? I couldn't quite put my finger on it.<br/><br/>My fears were confirmed when watching the film. The performances were excellent, all of the performances. Depp and Bonham Carter were especially good, and Lucas provided brilliant comic relief. The characters were also really well written, I could really feel their emotion and knew their past without even fully being told. The Mad-Hatter was really well written, the tragic insane man who sometimes is even aware of his own insanity; the angry and highly frustrated Red Queen who felt unloved... I could go on. The problem lies in the story, it just doesn't go anywhere and I know it's taken from Lewis Carrol's books, but the film just felt badly put together, it was just a collection of bits, put back to back and in the end went no-where. The start was promising and the ending was good, but in the middle there was nothing. Also, it just felt wrong. Burton is known for his visionary genius, and rightly so. Batman, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and others not only have great stories, but look and feel brilliant. Alice just didn't look right, it was far too dark and not at all what I imagined, I still can't quite put my finger on it but it just didn't feel right. I much preferred the Disney original."

","I really enjoyed the special effects and the 3D format of this film. The scrip itself is pretty good (there are better Alice In Wonderland scripts) but Tim Burton's visual style is really unique and entertaining.<br/><br/>Helena Carter was totally amazing!! Her timing and body language was perfect. The way she delivered ""off with his head"" make me laugh. It was a very memorable performance from a half human and half animated body.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway was kinda weak in her role. I think they cast her for her look (the pale skin, unique face, etc). She did a poor job and was the weakest character in this film."
"Stampsfightclub","5","1","3","24 March 2010"," A great idea misguided
","Alice (Wasikowska) flees an important party and chases a rabbit down a rabbit hole where she emerges in Wonderland, where she witnesses many strange things.<br/><br/>The build up to this film's release at the beginning of March was that Tim Burton was still perfecting it and Odeon was refusing to screen it because of the too quick to DVD release date. So far from perfect media vibe, the film was to no surprise big at the box office but has shared various attitudes of like and dislikes.<br/><br/>Based on Lewis Carroll's novels, Alice in Wonderland has never been tackled to its true potential according to visionary director Tim Burton. So taking that in mind, this is by far a more darker and more personally involved story of imagination and forced reality to many other depictions, particularly Disney's in the 1950's.<br/><br/>Opening with a young Alice having a bad dream and her father conversing with colleagues there is a more formal attitude to proceedings and when the film shunts forward many years to a surprise engagement party there is a feeling of, dare I say, convention and boredom, usually not present in a Burton film.<br/><br/>When however the white rabbit emerges there is hope and when Alice takes her tumble down the hole we can foresee Burton's dark side starting to emerge. Sadly, what is to follow feels a bit normal and nothing unique for the director.<br/><br/>The ""eat me"" and ""drink me"" sequence doesn't possess that magic the Disney film generated so easily, with a bored looking Wasikowska growing and shrinking and when things start to click and the door opens, there is too heavy hyperbole on darkness.<br/><br/>Burton of course has had a career spun from putting a dark spin on light ideas and events. Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare before Christmas spring to mind and applying that idea to Carroll's book, already dark with imagination seemed a sure winner. But there is too much detail and an attempt to justify fan's requirements for darkness rather than the story's own portrayal.<br/><br/>Of course this new wave of 3D hype gives the film an experimental feel and though I saw the 2D version, it would be hard to imagine how different it would be otherwise. The effects are outstanding, no question, but the use of them for the story's context feels heavy and indecent.<br/><br/>This is further established through the red queen's head, the ridiculous dormouse and the oddball styling of the Tweedles.<br/><br/>However the film does contain numerous spurts of enjoyment. Depp, as per usual, is visionary of his character, the final battle sequence is well staged and Anne Hathaway gives a gorgeous wispy gentle sweep to the white queen.<br/><br/>Whilst there are moments of technological stage brilliance there is no balance with the story's too heavy script with too many ideas and imaginations and is a case of a great idea misguided."

","Alice in Wonderland has a good storyline though not great. The creatures in the movie are poorly animated. With the budget it was given you would think the CGI creatures would have more texture. Johnny Depp can flat out act. This is one of those movies where this is not the case. The Mad Hatter character in this movies seems almost useless at times as if Tim Burton tried to force more screen time for Depp. It just seems as if you are seeing Jack Sparrow with orange hair. Helen Bonham Carter steals the show in this movie and thats not saying a whole lot. It appears as if there was too much thought put into the movie instead of letting the story flow, it was stopped to see if they could add more to it. I am very disappointed that Mr.Burton decided to film in 2D then convert it to 3D post production because he felt the 3D cameras were bulky. This movie had so much potential to be a true visual masterpiece. None of this is a knock on Tim Burton as he is one of my favorites. His movies are normally astounding. Alice In Wonderland just does not fit the bill."

"GazibBegins","4","1","3","20 March 2010"," Unimaginative and Boring
","3D movies appear to be dominating a certain corner of the cinematic market as of late, and that's fine, but the 2010 ""version"" of Alice in Wonderland is anything but a standout effort in 3D visual effects.<br/><br/>The most interesting scene in the movie comes right at the beginning when we meet her father, a mildly eccentric but genius inventor who inspires Alice to think for herself later in life and allow for the possibility of magic and wonder even when she's supposed to be a proper lady of sorts. The problem is: that's all we see of young Alice and the promising father character. Why tease us with that and then go with something completely different?<br/><br/>The 3D effects were virtually not even there. If you frequent 3D movies, you'll barely even notice it after awhile, except for the rabbit hole scene which was great, but again- why couldn't we get MORE of that? Instead, the fight scenes barely utilize the 'action coming at you' quality that 3D fans want. I hate to harp on this, but really it's stunning how little the glasses and the 3D effects mean, especially in the second half of the movie when it was plugged so heavily for this feature. It feels almost like a bait and switch.<br/><br/>The acting, for the most part, is atrocious. You barely understand what the red queen says half of the time. Anne Hathaway's mannerisms as the white queen were ridiculous. She never puts her arms down. That seems like a small thing to pick on but watch it again if you didn't notice this. Her arms hang at shoulder level in every scene, and she walks around with a delirious, sleepy expression on her face. She's bad. Fans of the traditional Depp will not like the mad hatter. Very little of his personality comes out in this. He's featured on all of the posters and he's mostly background. Coming to this movie expecting to see Depp is as big of a ripoff as expecting to see 3D. It doesn't happen!<br/><br/>The most fun moments in the movie, for me, were the entirely computer generated characters. The highlight of the movie is that these voice actors did an outstanding job. It's just a shame that they were supporting an awful Carter and Hathaway performance and a weak Depp role. The only 'real person' worth mentioning is Crispin Glover, who had a pretty one dimensional role as a sinister, ambitious steward but he held his own and had a couple of good moments. <br/><br/>This paragraph is reserved for Alice. You can drop the ball on the Mad Hatter and still have a compelling story, but what you CAN'T do is drop the ball on the hatter AND Alice. The parts for these two were written horribly. The only difference is Depp has the talent to save it into mediocrity, but THIS girl couldn't do ANYTHING with her part. The main character has to BE the main character eventually; she can't go about just receiving the action from everyone else, and then all of a sudden at the end we're supposed to be able to believe she can beat a dragon. Action/Adventure movies don't work like that!<br/><br/>I'm not saying she should have been trained up for a half hour of the movie like Rocky Balboa getting ready to take on the Russian, but she CAN'T just pick up a sword and be the champion of the white queen, for God's sakes! The scenes of adult Alice leading up to and following her new adventure in wonderland are excruciating. They will make you absolutely beg to be taken to wonderland. Either way, the actress seems to have a very difficult time *reacting* to what's going on around her instead of simply saying the lines. You can't say it was because she thought she was in a dream the whole time- about halfway in, she realizes she's actually in a magical kingdom and she'd better beat this dragon to save everybody, but the cold, stiff delivery that lets you know she can't really see all the computerized imagery around her to react to it remains.<br/><br/>Overall, it wasn't a bad movie, but a boring one. The choices made from the scenery to the effects (for the most part) to the acting were just basic. Any director or someone with a knowledge of acting will say that the first choice is usually the least interesting, and that's what we have here- a movie of obvious choices that misses the mark of wowing us in any way."

"pawprint2000","3","1","3","19 March 2010"," Deeply, deeply disappointing
","As a long-term fan of Burton's work, I was greatly looking forward to seeing this film. Even his lesser movies usually have much to commend them and stand out from most of the dross on offer in cinemas. But this was truly awful. The one positive angle was the look. I found the use of 3D largely superfluous but the overall aesthetic was stunning and provided some great scenes. Sadly the sheer awfulness of the plot wiped out any credit built up by the visuals. To put one's own Wonderland narrative in place of Lewis Carroll's is clearly a risky strategy. It didn't pay off but I guess I could admire the courage to try. But to turn the whole thing into a quest culminating in a battle (in the style of Narnia/LOTR) was simply folly and wholly at odds with the spirit of Wonderland. Actually, the worst aspect for me was sandwiching the fantasy scenes between a 'real-life' storyline that saw Alice reject an obnoxious suitor and head off to become some kind of instant business guru. The whole ""Let's reposition Alice as a woman with 21st century values"" ending was so mind-numbingly embarrassing that I hung my head in despair. The authors should hang their heads in shame."
"backbrnr","1","1","3","19 March 2010"," nothing new
","The story of Alice in Wonderland is a surreal trip that has been done a million times. Tim Burton's same-old same-old over-the-top extravaganza loses itself in self indulgence and meanders away from the point of the tale. There's no need to re-create this classical story in some bizzaro world image of Burton's own. The lush visuals and signature performances by a glittering cast are a rich banquet of sweets--I was initially escalated by the sugar high but came crashing down after the buzz wore off, leaving me hungry for something nutritious. But nowadays, spectacle seems to take precedent over substance in films. I would like to see Burton ply his unique perspective and directorial skills on something truly meaty."

","I saw this movie about a week ago. It was actually a last minute decision, and I was a little bit worried about whether or not I would enjoy it. Tim Burton either makes a *really* good movie (like ""Mars Attacks"") or a *really* bad movie (like ""Planet of the Apes"").<br/><br/>However, this movie rocked! I thought it would be way too dark, but the story has a perfect balance of creepy and cool. The effects are great but not overwhelming, the acting is superb and the music is beautiful. Johnny Depp was really good as the the Mad Hatter. Before, I was wondering if his performance was going to be like ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Luckily, that horror did not occur here at all!<br/><br/>My favorite part is when the Red Queen screams, ""He tried to kill me!"" at the ending, to her #1 Henchman/Boyfriend (I forget his name).<br/><br/>Although it's really different from the animated 1950 something cartoon, this is easily another classic. I'll be happily waiting for the DVD release, so that I can add it to my shelf! If you want to have a wonderful time, go and see ""Alice in Wonderland"" (pun intended)."

","Alice in Wonderland 3-D isn't an enchanting Disney film. Nor is it engrossing. Alice seems depressed and the Mad Hatter seems like he needs a bath very, very soon.

A couple of scenes actually turned my stomach. I'll give you a hint; a surly mouse with a sharp needle around living beings can lead to some painful moments. <br/><br/>None of the characters here seem like they're having much fun and watching these miserable people and animals is kind of a drag. <br/><br/>I kept thinking of the animated Alice in Wonderland and wishing that were up on the screen instead. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives the Mad Hatter some real emotions but he seems dirty-like he needs a good scrubbing.

","Disney used to be wacky, in tune with its characters and with the child in all of us. This is so syrupy that my teeth hurt. What gets me most are the missed chances - practically every character relationship, Red Queen/Knave of Hearts, White Queen/Alice, Mad Hatter/everybody else, has glaringly obvious potentials which are just as glaringly obviously ignored. (The erotic potential one could not have even hoped for.) The result is a story with no force or forward movement whatsoever. The only reason I am giving it some points is that it is very nicely turned out in visual detail, and there are a few scenes which remind me of Disney before it drowned in its own zero-fat mayonnaise - most notably the tea at Mad Hatter's, which somehow escaped the board-room's attention to convey a few minutes of genuinely disjointed, out-of-control, disturbingly familiar shifted reality. I finally give it a pass because I was amused while it lasted, shallowly."
"echobase","Null","1","3","14 March 2010"," Very disappointing
","I was really looking forward to this. The trailer looked amazing and Burton seemed just the right man to bring something new (and his amazing visual style) to a well known story... And yet, I found myself suffering from the ""Hook"" effect during the whole film. First all of, the 3D (which generally I really love) brought absolutely nothing to the film. In fact it of all rather distracting and annoying. It's interesting that I thought it felt almost an added on gimmick and only today I found out that it was indeed decided after most of the film had already been filmed. Johnny Depp does his usual weird, mad character, which by now we are all become a bit sick of. The design of the whole ""wonderland"" becomes a bit monotonous and boring after about 20 minutes. And even some of the special effects look pretty bad (next to some really stunning ones too, I have to admit). But worst of all it the story. First of all, why bother with this sort of ""sequel"" idea? What is really the point of the whole Alice has now grown? Does it really matter that she had been there before? And why is she so keep in saving the Mad Hatter? And what about that rabbit? Who is he working for? What's his role in all this? And (big spoiler here... watch out) what's point of all that going to China at the end? What a mess! And finally the music score: yes, it could have been good, if only they had work out where to use it, as opposed to ending up having music throughout the whole film, thus diminishing the effect that music should have. Overblown is the word that comes to mind. I wonder what this film could have been like if maybe Tim Burton had made it, without Disney behind his shoulders."
"filmbantha","7","1","3","13 March 2010"," Lacking depth but visually stunning
","I've eagerly anticipated Tim Burton's latest releases from before I can remember, and with Alice in Wonderland marking his first foray into 3-D, this was no exception. Arriving early at the cinema, we were treated to a live satellite link-up from the world premiere hosted at London's Leicester square. Watching Prince Charles shake hands with almost everyone involved in the film was not my idea of fun but it certainly made an interesting change to the cinema experience. After the formalities he was shown into the cinema and the film could eventually start for him at the world premiere, and me in the comfort of Cineworld Didsbury.<br/><br/>Unlike previous adaptations of Alice, Burton takes the viewer on a new journey, only loosely following aspects of Carrol's classic stories 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Through the looking glass' to create an entirely new experience. Although this may disappoint fans of the stories, there are still a lot of familiar characters to be seen as Alice is portrayed as a young woman returning to the world she first envisaged as a child - almost like an unofficial sequel to Carrol's work.<br/><br/>Having only seen two films in 3-D prior to Alice in Wonderland; Coraline and Avatar, I was still unsure whether 3-D was more than just a gimmick, however, it certainly enhanced the visual aspect of the film, bringing life to Burton's dark and mysterious world.<br/><br/>There is some fantastic casting within the film, especially Matt Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and although the computer generated effects used to render the characters are impressive, I was left longing for the extravagant costumes that Burton fans are used to seeing in his earlier films - Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands come to mind. Despite this, we still see a glimpse of Burton's once awe-inspiring creations with a number of weird creatures that inhabit Wonderland, as well as some suitably creepy decapitated heads that serve as stepping stones in a castle moat.<br/><br/>Putting aside a few moments that young children may find scary, this is definitely a family movie, with elements of humour clearly aimed at the younger audiences. One such moment comes near the end of the film when Johnny Depp displays his 'funderwhacking' abilities, and whilst that phrase may excite people who have yet to see the film, for me it merely conjures up a horrendous image that I would rather forget! Most people will have high expectations of the film due to the calibre of actors and actresses involved but I have seen all of them in much better performances, apart from Barbara Windsor - it's nice to not see her face for once, as Burton does not devote enough screen time to any one of the multitude of characters that inhabit Wonderland.<br/><br/>Although Alice is not a landmark film by any means, I cannot deny that I was soon absorbed in the story, despite its numerous flaws. If you do decide to head to the cinema, make sure you see it in 3-D, as this definitely played a big part in my enjoyment of the film. I doubt I would watch Alice in Wonderland again but would certainly recommend it for families and young children.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>If you liked this film you will also enjoy these:<br/><br/>Coraline, Labyrinth, Laputa: Castle In The Sky, The Fall"

But even if Avatar had never been made, I would still have been sitting in the cinema watching Alice and thinking 'What the hell am I doing here?' There were at least two moments when I wanted to leave but I gave the film another chance. In vain.<br/><br/>The plot is flat, the main character dull and not very likable. And again - Helena Bonham-Carter, I simply cannot comprehend the fascination with her (probably the fact that she is Burton's life partner throws some light on that phenomenon).<br/><br/>The only strong features of the movie are the fact that it is aesthetically pleasing (although that doesn't justify the 3D mode because it is not used to its full potential or even half as spectacularly as in Avatar), and Johnny Depp. Alas, his talent alone will not save the movie."

When a repulsive young man tries to propose to her in front of all the guests, Alice runs off and falls down the rabbit hole once more. Her return to Wonderland is initially a nostalgic one, as she must first find her way through a tiny door. Yet beyond this, it is clear that Wonderland has changed considerably under the reign of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Alice revisits a number of family characters including, the Chesire Cat (Stephen Fry), a Blue Caterpillar (Alan Rickman) and the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). However, some of them are quite skeptical as to whether this is actually the same Alice they once knew. Regardless, they reveal to her a scroll that pictures Alice slaying the Jabberwocky monster, suggesting that she will have to rise to this challenge herself to defeat the Red Queen.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is one of the most visually inventive directors in Hollywood and each of his projects is met with great expectations upon release. In adapting Lewis Carroll's celebrated and timeless novel this could well be one of the most anticipated projects of his career. The thought of combining Carrooll's imaginative characters with Burton's artistic flair has for many been an incredibly attractive proposition. It is not mandatory to see the film in 3D to appreciate the efforts of Burton and his creative team to create such a visually rich and elaborate world that immerses one into Carroll's poetic vision. Even in 2D the use of colour is vibrant, either bursting brightly or saturating scenes through the sets and costumes. Other visual treats, such as the grandeur of the castles and the seamless monster animations, serve to enhance what is a highly luminous display. Given the quality of the visuals it is all the more disappointing that the screenplay by Linda Woolverton is so lacklustre. The achievement of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was that Burton respected the original text visually and thematically, while also adding some small new material to enrich the narrative. The script here is not only unfaithful to the original story but it is also a far more generic fantasy. The dark symbolism and subtext of puberty long associated with Carroll's story is absent in favour of a very simple coming of age tale, typical of numerous other Disney films. The smallest person might be able to change the world but the plots are always the same. At less than two hours this is not a particularly inspired adventure because not a great deal eventuates and also because the story is padded with familiar action sequences that lack tension.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the performances are mostly good even though the actors seem to be having more fun than the audience. After an uncharacteristically dull performance in Public Enemies, Depp is livelier here, adding touches of humour and even some vulnerability in his performance. Depp thrives on kooky characters such as this and while it might be a role catered perfectly for him, it is still not quite as memorable or as fun as some of his very best performances. This is most likely because the dialogue in the film only shows glimpses of some of the wordplay from Carroll's story. Wasikowska, a young Australian actress, is very sweet as Alice and amidst a wealth of talent here she is reasonably impressive, achieving a great deal of warmth through her smile. It is a shame that this lovely performance is only allowed to develop in a purely conventional way as Alice rises to the challenge and realises her answers in and out of Wonderland. The efforts of some of the voice actors like Stephen Fry and Alan Rickman are welcome too, but the yelling of the Red Queen becomes rather tiresome.<br/><br/>Although this is a visual delight, it is not up with Burton's best work. It lacks the dark edge of Sweeney Todd and the humour and wit of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It is possible that the involvement of Disney has redirected the film's narrative to become more conventional and familiar in appealing to families and small children. Regardless, it is difficult to recommend the film in either 2D or 3D simply because the script never allows the film to reach its potential with any exuberance. It is an attractive but generic fantasy film that will not satisfy those that loved the original story or those that are new to the rabbit hole."
"torp_pink","7","1","3","13 March 2010"," Johnny was the best part of the movie.....
","I love Tim Burton films and Johnny Depp is my all-time favorite actor and always will be and I love the two together. So ever since I heard about this movie I was excited and I was happy to see it. I was disappointed but not as much as some people appear to be.<br/><br/>Yes the plot of the movie was very dry, as I warn people who wish to see it. There is just the one story: Alice goes to Wonderland and must save it. There are no little twists. No turns. No extra stories branching off to capture our interest. But I do believe that the graphics and some of the characters made up for that. Mia's portrayal of Alice was okay but it could have been better. She seemed monotonous. She didn't show too much emotion and I think she could have been a little more shocked of some of the things that happened to her. The Red and White Queens were well put together and they were both amusing. Absolem was brilliant, as Alan Rickman makes his characters. The Knave, Dormous, March Hare... they were all wonderful. I love Stephen Fry, he's an amazing voice actor and Chesh was brilliant. He was probably my second favorite character in the movie. And, of course, Johnny. No matter what you put him in. No matter what situation, role, movie whatever, he's always brilliant. He has this ability to hold an audience's attention. I barely noticed Mia's dry acting, I barely noticed the boring plot because of the brilliant Mad Hatter. I have to say that it was the best portrayal of a Mad Hatter that I have ever seen because he was actually MAD. Johnny also combined a lot of his other characters into the Mad Hatter, particularly Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka who were both insane (and had awesome hats) just like the Mad Hatter. I also enjoyed his continuous voice changes. I like the Scottish accent, it made me think of Braveheart (without Mel Gibson's fake Scottish accent). I also liked Hatter's evil alter-ego, it was a nice twist to the character.<br/><br/>The graphics were also brilliant. I love Tim Burton's attention to detail and he didn't disappoint me in that aspect of the film.<br/><br/>But the plot and Alice herself left much to be desired. And it also annoyed me (though most people might disagree with me on this fact) that the Hatter appeared to have feelings for Alice but didn't act on them. I know Johnny said that they were more like siblings but I know what I saw on that screen.<br/><br/>All up I liked the movie but it could have been better."
"cubalibre1","6","1","3","12 March 2010"," In wild and wacky wonderland!!
","I t s was inevitable. After all, few filmmakers can match Tim Burton's skills in visualising a wild and wacky wonderland. The director of such beguiling tales as Edward Scissorhands and Sweeney Todd transforms Lewis Carroll's classic children's story into a film of the hugely entertaining kind.<br/><br/>All the author's beloved character including the Mad Hatter ( D e p p ) , Tweedles Dee and Dumb (both voiced by Matt Lucas) and the grinning Cheshire cat (gleefully dubbed by Stephen Fry) are brought vividly to life, with the added attraction of 3-D.<br/><br/>Burton re-invents Alice (Australian newcomer Wasikowska) as a free-spirited teenager. Of course, she once again tumbles down the rabbit hole to emerge in a wondrous dimension ruled by the fearsome Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter, outrageously campy). Alice changes size from one moment to the next and the adventures in her alternate reality are so fantastic that the bookend sequences set in the real world pale in comparison.<br/><br/>The film's climactic confrontation with the dreaded ""Jabberwocky"" is a bit of a let-down. But these are minor quibbles. A characteristic feast for the senses, Alice in Wonderland is for those who fancy the funky and the far-out."
"jpschapira","7","1","3","9 March 2010"," Imagining Tim Burton
","It's a challenge for someone like Tim Burton to do an adaptation of the Alice books by Lewis Carroll. You see, Burton has never been and could never be recognized for his writing, most of which he doesn't do. What I mean is that he always starts from scratch, as he bases his movies on things to create especially breathtaking worlds. His art has always been more on the visual side than on the storytelling, and in many ways his ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a confirmation of this and of his talents as an author; his capacity to remain unchangeable through everything. <br/><br/>He doesn't have to, but apparently he wants to and, if anything, his ""Alice"" is the new expression of a co-existent universe that persists among all of his films. This universe is also coherent, because visually it has a special, recognizable mood, always accompanied delightfully by Danny Elfman's original music. Seeing Alice opening that little door and entering Neverland is not very different from Ichabod Crane's recurrent dream in ""Sleepy Hollow"", or from Edward Bloom's arrival to Spectre in ""Big Fish"", for that matter. <br/><br/>What else can I tell you about a story we all know? What else can I suggest than going in and see for yourselves what Tim Burton has made with it, visually? Cinema being a visual art and Burton being a visual master, the result is, and this should be a unanimous thought, one dazzling set after another, with a particular choice of color and light that should be related to the characters who inhabit each one. The most interesting of these choices might be the normal world Alice lives in; a boring, organized, aristocratic, choreographed London that Burton shoots with irony, occasionally transforming it into something more edgy with the thoughts of Alice's imagination (imagination is the key to every Tim Burton movie). <br/><br/>If you don't know the characters, any review should say nothing about them so the movie ride becomes a bit more unpredictable and surprising. It's clearly a story that screenwriter Linda Woolverton (who wrote ""The Lion King"" among other Disney features) thought about once and wrote without expecting many changes, and probably Chris Lebenzon treated the editing process the same way. <br/><br/>The story and its development, obvious and rudimentary, adds nothing new to the table. But the movie reminds us that the co-existence of a whole universe among all the Burton films is not only visual; this universe also exists thematically. Maybe the director was never able to sustain a complete story â€“he doesn't achieve it here- and maybe now I realize (I was telling Grillo) the reason I love ""Big Fish"" so much is because, like I said in my review, it's a ""collection of beautiful scenes that don't cease to amaze us""; therefore so many little stories that don't have to be explained and completely resolve, have more weight than the story of a man and his son that is the movie, which, by the way, is the movie's point: ""The man becomes his stories"". <br/><br/>But that man, Edward Bloom, was one of Burton's outcasts, nostalgic and imaginative (again, the key to any Burton movie), constantly going back to his childhood years, where unresolved dreams and issues always awaited the mentioned Ichabod Crane, and an Edward who wanted to have real hands, and a Willy Wonka who wanted his father to be proud of him. In this way (and there's probably things I'm missing that will come back soon or revisiting the director's films), it's perfectly clear that the Mad Hatter (the most developed character in this movie; there always has to be one above the rest) has lost his head and is always looking for a sense of 'whatever you wanna call it' in his life; you can see it in his crazy eyes. With or without Alice. Before and after her.<br/><br/>And some people still wonder why Johnny Depp is the absolute protagonist of the film.<br/><br/>Special note: The portrayal of Alice by Mia Wasikowska, which will never be recognized, is one of the best performances you'll ever see in this genre. The idea of a child who wants to dream but knows that it should be impossible at a particular stage of life; a constant disbelief for everything she sees that can be perceived in her look and annoying tone of voice; a little girl who's becoming a woman but knows her father spoiled her too much and it will be difficult to change that and accept maturity. A girl without self confidence, even when she knows she has all the answers."
"rockergirl2067","6","1","3","7 March 2010"," Good movie but not for everyone
","I'm a huge Tim Burton so I was pretty excited. I personally loved the movie. All the actors did a pretty good job. Newcomer Mia (I forgot her last name) was great, Johnny Depp was insanely brilliant (I am a HUGE johnny depp fan so my opinion might be different from others) and Helena Bonham Carter was hysterical. My friends and I had a wonderful time watching this.However, this movie isn't exactly for everyone. First off, you have to have fun with it. You can't too critical because there are some pretty random points that make no sense, but I found that even better. I guess being a Tim Burton fan has some impact. And lastly, don't go in there with HIIIGH expectations. For me it passed mine but it might not with others. Overall, I enjoyed this movie very much"
"Smashtokyotoys","8","2","10","8 April 2010"," It's a CHILDREN'S MOVIE not Moby Dick!
","I've read 60% of these over-thesaurus-ed reviews written by people who write as though they they have had the life sucked out of them. The original Alice was written FOR CHILDREN by a drug-addled man who is forever known as the only author alive to get away with the phrase ""It was all a dream!"" It is a children's movie made for children. Writing long winded reviews using words like 'trite' and describing it as boring and the ""worst movie you've ever seen"" just shows you have the mental brain age of an unfertilized egg. 200 posts all focusing on two points, the acting and the story...Jesus! What about the magnificent creature designs and the fantasy architecture? The environments harking back to the days of Froud, Labyrynth and the Dark Crystal? Put your thesauruses away, if your over thirty, hate this type of movie, hate Johnny Depp then DON'T GO. If you're an ALICE purist then OF COURSE you were going to hate it. Ask any Star Wars fan or Transformers fan what they thought of the new movies and they damn well hated them too. Guess what. I hated the original story of Alice in Wonderland because it's creepy. It's an LSD induced nightmare. This story had Disney showing disembodied heads in a moat! Awesome! Apart from the ridiculous dance at the end it was great! Worst movie? You've never seen Battlefield Earth? Never sat through The Kentucky Fried Movie or anything with Bud Spencer in it? What about the forty Jeniffer Aniston movies? Think before you write! Vainglorious comments are great if your a REAL critic but seriously...nobody on here is. You don't come across as critics, you come across as cynics. It's an escape from reality...that's all, don't treat it as a personal insult to your life because you come across as total tossers. ""Oh god I just wasted two hrs of my life watching this movie!"" I just wasted 2 mins of my life reading you whine over nothing. It's a kids flick, if it wasn't made by Burton none of you geeks would have anything to complain about. You act like he's never made a bad kids flick before...ahem...the corpse bride...ahem."

","Having not seen the original I went in with no opinion, despite others saying it would be 'magical'. Its fair to say Tim Burton pulled off an excellent 3D film, however it was just OK. Nothing spectacular, nothing amazing. It just shows his earlier films are so original they are hard to beat! My only two reasons for seeing this film were, firstly...Mr.Depp, which I must say is the only actor (once again) who could pull of the character remarkably. He always perfects obscure down to a tee. Secondly to see the film itself, as having never seen it before and having heard so much about it I felt it was about time to give it a go. I'd say go see it just to see what all the fuss is about, but on the whole, what really was all the hype about?"
"alexart-1","7","2","11","5 March 2010"," Uneven but Wonderful Burtonian Fare
","It was difficult for me to decide upon a rating for this. After hotly anticipating Alice in Wonderland since July of 2009 when the first trailer came out, March 5th of 2010 finally came and I got to see it. Alice in Wonderland is quite different than most of the other editions of the Alice story and also one of the better ones, yet it is far from perfect. One might expect more from Burton, but all in all the film is satisfying. The 3-D is not quite as good as the 3-D in other films, but it is still quite nice. The film is mostly held up by strong performances and good art design, but brought down by an incredibly uneven script. It was difficult, but I finally arrived at the decision that Alice is in fact a good movie.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland has been changed slightly for this edition. The film is a semi-sequel to Alice in Wonderland with a few elements of Through the Looking Glass incorporated. The story follows Alice Kingsley, beautifully played by Mia Wasikowska (try pronouncing that one correctly!), after she has been proposed to by a man she is not in love with. Alice is nineteen here and is now returning to Wonderland...make that Underland. In Underland she meets the usual cast of characters including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), the Cheshire Cat, Absalom/the Caterpillar (Alan Rickman), Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb, and the Jabberwocky. A few new characters even join the now familiar crew.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, the film's quality is sustained by good performances and an excellent art department combined with special effects. Mia Wasikowska, who you may recognize as Sophie from In Treatment (probably not though), gives another great performance. Can someone explain why this is not household name yet? I surprisingly enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance very much as well. Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway act nicely as well. And now for the art department. The sets, which there are very few because most everything is CGI, are quite nice. The costume design is elaborate and accurate for the time period.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about what was just so-so in the movie. The script is definitely what has caused some people to hate this movie. At the beginning, the script is very weak and slow moving, but eventually it speeds up. Unfortunately, it takes about an hour to do so. Also, Tim Burton does the exact same thing he does every time: dark, Hot Topic-esquire film-making. I'm sorry, but since when has doing the same thing every time meant being a great director? The film includes his favorite actors in pretty much the same parts. Isn't the Mad Hatter just a bit too similar to Willy Wonka? Of course, what Tim Burton does is enjoyable, but isn't it all a little too much already? Alice in Wonderland is not an easy film to explain. It's both great and so-so. Tim Burton has definitely put his magic touch on certain parts and the actors try very hard, but the film lacks a consistent script. I want to like it more, but I just can't. The 3-D provides some physical depth to the movie, but the movie lacks metaphorical depth."
"pabstpabst","3","1","4","7 December 2011"," Another childhood pearl ruined
","I am writing this, moments after watching the movie, so forgive the harsh words.<br/><br/>When i first read Alive in Wonderland and after wards saw the Walt Disney masterpiece of an animation movie, I was amazed by the depths and tweaks of each character. Though everyone was mostly one dimensional and one purpose character, they all had they special way of being and talking.<br/><br/>In this up-to-date movie, a lot of the characters don't feel to have a purpose or a back story at all. The tweaks has been covered by an excuse of sadness which gets thrustet down your throat without any real explanation. Furthermore, a lot of important roles have either disappeared or replaced by someone without name or history.<br/><br/>The story is very linear, which is nothing new from Burton, though his other movies don't really need big plot twists to be enjoyable. This story though, really needed something big to help it off the road it, at the end, takes for granted. A lot of the story feels sped up and unexplained to keep it under a proper time rate, which backlashes through the audience, not really knowing why the certain scenes or events were used.<br/><br/>If you were looking towards this movie for great one liners and fast replying mayhem, as you might know from the original animation movie form Disney, you might want to skip out on it anyway. There's nothing childishly naive about any of the dialogs, making the story seem like it was just a tried and true copy that could be outplayed in any scenario or any story.<br/><br/>Talking about childish naivety (A thing that made this Alice a hit in the past, as well as Winnieh the Pooh). The movie lacks every aspect of this enjoyable feature. The only inch of this can be found in Tweedledee and Tweedledum who doesn't get enough screen time at all.<br/><br/>And just that one last thing. The plot that the movie sets in the beginning, seems through most of the movie, to have nothing to do with the end. The transformation from ""insecure Alice"" to ""Alice with new beliefs and hopes"" never really shows. The intro and ending more seems like an intermezzo than a story starter and a story ender<br/><br/>My advice: Watch it if you want background noise. Don't expect to come out after 2 hours of bad dialogs with a satisfaction If you want your kid to watch quality Disney, show them the old Alice movie."
"girllovesmovies27","2","1","4","24 July 2011"," Watch other adaptations instead
","I did not like this film whatsoever. Johnny Depp's Hatter and whatever that was The Queen of Hearts were far too freaky, even for adults. This movie was far too trippy ! Did they want viewers to feel like they were on an acid trip or something like that? I couldn't stand any of the characters/actors in this film. It was one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. Normally I like the character that is Depp, but I think it has run its course. If I had children, they wouldn't be watching this film. I personally prefer the adaption that was a TV miniseries on SYFY. If you have kids, show them the original animated film instead because it's not creepy looking."
"ant501","Null","1","4","27 November 2010"," Nice film - shame about the title.
","I am late with this review; many others have said their piece long ago and it appears that many expected it to be a re-make of the famous story.<br/><br/>If Mr Burton had called it ""Not Alice In Wonderland"" or perhaps ""Alice in Wonderland 2"" or perhaps ""Alice Revisits Wonderland"" or even, for as much as I care, ""Alice meets Abbott and Costello in Wonderland"" then maybe people would take the film on its merits and not on their ill-researched expectations.<br/><br/>I would have stopped there but apparently that is not enough.. so here goes: OK, it had its flaws and a few of the performances were rather derivative. I would be astonished if Helena Bonham Carter ever swore she had never seen Miranda Richardson doing Queenie in Blackadder before forming her characterisation of the Red Queen. Nevertheless she and Alan Rickman and Stephen Fry and Matt Lucas were all great. The only thing I hated was the stupid Futterwacken dance (what was THAT about?)."
"thehairthieves","6","1","4","21 September 2010"," Good movie...if it wasn't for Disney
","At first, I didn't even know that this was a different plot to most Alice in Wonderland films, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a fresh take on the old classic. Initially, I wasn't sure it would be much, due to the appalling quality of films made in recent years. The film starts off quite slowly, with very little happening in the opening few minutes, and what does happen is entirely irrelevant to the plot. Once Alice finds her way down the rabbit hole, things start to get going. I enjoyed the dark atmosphere, being quite Harry-Potteresque at times. I liked the CG effects, with many of the characters either lovable or reflecting their actor's appearance while maintaining the fantasy element. This film's triumph though, it its casting. Helena Bonham-Carter makes for a superb Red Queen, and is by far the most amusing character in the entire film. Johnny Depp, who I regard as the only good American actor apart from John Malkovich, is also very good as the Mad Hatter, possessing yet another virtually flawless accent. Matt Lucas was a surprise for me, but I felt that he was an excellent choice as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, bringing just the right naivety to them.<br/><br/>The film runs very smoothly for most of the beginning and middle parts, with some features that I thought would never make it into a Disney film. Sadly though, things take a turn for the worse when the climax of the film comes around. The battle scene is very mundane, predictable and just didn't grip me at all. I'm reminded strongly of the battle with the Basilisk in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, except that scene is now 8 years old and puts the fight with the Jabberwocky to shame. The CG effects in 2010 look rather pitiful in comparison to those in 2002. The Basilisk looked so much more believable, not to mention the entire scene was more suspenseful, despite the fact I already knew the outcome of it from reading the book.<br/><br/>But the battle scene is nothing compared to just a few seconds of insanity that follow it. Johnny Depp's dance can only be described as a brain explosion on the part of the writers. I simply sat, staring at the screen, my only thought being ""what were they thinking?!"". It is truly one of the worst moments in any film, something that doesn't fit in with the rest of the film at all. Not even the music fits in with the Victorian setting of the movie. Johnny Depp should be ashamed of the brief seconds he spent dancing in this abomination of an ending. Speaking of which, I have seen many a cringe-worthy ending of American films in my time, but none as ludicrous or inconsequential as this. It is as if there were two sets of writers for this film. One for the middle, and one for the beginning an end. The two sections seem to bare no resemblance to one another, and may as well be from different films.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this film was gunning for an 8 out of 10, if it wasn't for the final few minutes which went from bland to inexplicable. It begs the question, did Tim Burton have anything to do with this excruciating ending? Or did Disney take over when it was nearly finished, and attempted to tie any hint of a loose end up and turn this once promising film into another piece of Hollywood tripe to be thrown onto the dung-heap that constitutes the majority of American cinema."
"msb-utils","5","1","4","1 July 2010"," Disappointing eye-candy
","This is a pretty average Disney movie. I had high expectations because of Tim Burton directing it. And actually Burton's visual style is easily recognizable. But basically, that is what saves this movie from a total failure. I won't complain that the story is not that from the book: that was announced, and therefore it was expected. But I was expecting a Burtonian story. Finding a typical Disney story was very disappointing.<br/><br/>About the characters, you would expect to have a great participation of Alice, or maybe the Hatter (Burton's idol Johnny Depp), but instead the most prominent character happens to be the Red Queen, by far.<br/><br/>At least the movie is not boring, and well produced (as it was expected).<br/><br/>Summary: Technically great, visually great; poor, disappointing story.

"katherine_stears","2","1","4","23 June 2010"," Movies Suck: Tim Burton, Noooooo!
","Alright people, this needs to stop. The new ""Alice in Wonderland"" movie has been getting way too much hype for much too long. As a die-hard Alice fan, I have to say I was excited to hear that Tim Burton would be taking up the project of molding Alice in his own twisted image, but that was when I was naive. I was a fool to think Burton would see Alice the same way I did... <br/><br/>The movie itself was, admittedly, not nearly as bad as I'd feared it was going to be, but that does NOT mean that I liked it. FAR FROM IT REALLY. I've seen some stinkers, but this one simply reeked. Johnny Depp's performance was Depp-ish, and if you're into Johnny Depp you'll probably enjoy his work as the Mad Hatter. You also probably like smelling your own ASS... The Dormouse both confused and irritated me. I wasn't sure while I was at the theater, but I looked it up - the Dormouse was definitely NOT a girl... A lot of really good characters were completely left out... Also, Burton for SOME reason took it upon himself to start giving everything different names. Like ""Mad Hatter"", ""Red Queen"" and ""Castle"" and things simply weren't good enough for him. No, he decided to give everyone and everything these bizarre names, which I would have supported (Wonderland being a nonsensical world and all) had Burton at least TRIED. But the names were so stupid and ridiculous it just sounded like he took a bunch of weird words he found in the dictionary and mixed up the letters. And boom! Meet Snorglflaffen, AKA the Mad Hatter. What was THAT?<br/><br/>...I was pretty convinced that I was going to hate the movie the second I found out Johnny Depp was going to be in it. In fact, I was so sure I was going to hate it I was completely blown away by how almost good he was. I honestly wouldn't have chosen him myself but he wasn't nearly as horrible as I feared he was going to be. But there's always that ONE character, isn't there? That ONE character that you hate more than anything you've ever hated before.. And of course, in this case, it had to be none other than Alice herself. I couldn't believe it... But no, Burton decided to remain true to this horrible image he's been making for himself lately and give Alice what I've lately been calling ""Bella Syndrome"", and I call it that because it's much easier to type than ""Obnoxious cardboard box personality girl that generally wastes my time by existing and is in serious need of a mental rebooting or overall removal from society Syndrome"" and it gets the point across just as nicely. Burton's Alice, like Bella, had all the charisma of a wheel of cheese, and basically let herself be led around Wonderland (OH sorry, I mean ""UNDERLAND"") without bothering to stop and ask any questions. ""Oh, it's just a dream. I'll wake up EVENTUALLY."" This was seriously her mentality until the last twenty minutes of the movie. It's comforting to know that a Victorian-era English noblewoman of 19 years of age has enough sense to think that no matter how real a situation is, no matter how much ACTUAL physical danger she's in, if there's talking animals then it MUST BE A DREAM. She didn't actually DO anything until the end of the movie, where she killed the Jabberwock... <br/><br/>In closing, I think Tim Burton needs to just stop this madness... I'm sick of it, and I'm sick of HIM.<br/><br/>This review was edited for length and content. To read the whole review, and others, check out my blog! http://moviessuck.tumblr.com/"
"pupops","3","1","4","18 March 2010"," Great Burton Film, but not up to his standards...
","When I first saw this movie, I noticed something odd and out of place. I try to point it out but I wasn't able to. Despite the great non- conventional work delivered by Johnny Depp, some natural presence by Mia Wasikowska and other threats... I couldn't, until I saw the CGI. There are a lot of technical errors that it's impossible for me, (Special Effects artist), to believe the environment I'm supposed to be drawn to. Nevertheless, The 3D animation is weak and some points, looking like a Low Budget Movie. The Mix Between Live Action Make Up, and CGI didn't work at all in here. It does look like a cut out. Depp's Make Up and the Bad 3D didn't blend right. There are huge Lighting Issues, Bad Camera Work and some unreal rendering of the 3d scenery.

"paperback_wizard","7","1","4","8 March 2010"," Six Impossible Things I Can Believe About 'Alice in Wonderland'
","The purist in me wanted to hate the movie before it was even completed; but, when in Wonderland, you must be willing to let go of everything you know and embrace what you see. And so, as Alice herself did, I'll list the six impossible things I can believe.<br/><br/>The first is Alice herself. She's no longer a little girl, but a grown woman who needs to decide what direction to follow in life. The adventures of her childhood, she's now convinced, were simply dreams. Now, when the White Rabbit leads her down to Wonderland, it is no chance encounter. The narrative woven by Tim Burton is one of a chosen protector, a champion whose intervention will free the inhabitants of Wonderland from the dominion of a tyrant. That champion, of course, is Alice herself.<br/><br/>The tyrant is the Red Queen, who years ago usurped the crown from her sister, the White Queen. This is the second impossible thing. The character of the Red Queen is blended with that of the Queen of Hearts, as she often is. Originally, though, the Queen of Hearts was always the ruler of Wonderland, lording (or ladying?) over the other Suits (Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades). The Red and White Queens lived in Looking-Glass Land, and despite their chess battle, they were actually quite friendly with each other. That was the first thing that bothered me about this new movie when I learned about it. However, if you're going to have an epic battle, which this movie does, then you can either face the Queen of Hearts against the other Suits (which may or may not have been a good idea) or you can do what Tim Burton did. One thing you cannot do is have an 'Alice' movie without the Queen yelling ""OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!""<br/><br/>The Jabberwock is number three (and yes, it's Jabberwock, not Jabberwocky). The fearsome dragon of Looking-Glass Land never quite made an appearance in the book, or most of the movies. However, it does make an appearance in this movie, as the Red Queen's resident beastie. It is the creature that Alice must slay if she is to end the Red Queen's reign of terror.<br/><br/>Some very unlikely characters help Alice in her quest. The Cheshire Cat, originally so enigmatic as to be entirely unhelpful, now is almost eager to put his very life on the line for Alice, the White Queen, and even the Hatter himself. Still an enigma, and still charmingly puzzling, he is another indispensable character, wonderfully played by British character actor Stephen Fry.<br/><br/>If the Cheshire Cat is one example of an unlikely character coming to the rescue, then the Hatter is an even better one. Still mad, and still drinking tea with his friends the March Hare and Dormouse when Alice finds him, the Hatter is perhaps the one resident of Wonderland who has been most affected by the Red Queen's rule. His desire to see the ""bloody bighead"" fall prompts him to risk his life for Alice time and again, even though he is one of the few in Wonderland who actually believes she is the intended champion. ""I'd know you anywhere,"" he declares, helping her escape capture at the hands of Stayne, the infamous Knave of Hearts, played by Crispin Glover.<br/><br/>The sixth impossible thing is how much I actually liked this movie. Despite the changes made, the end product is quite a good story. Several characters from the books and previous movies didn't quite make the cut, of course. One character I would have really liked to see would have been the White Knight from Looking-Glass Land, who was Alice's escort for part of her journey and would have been more believable in the role filled by the Mad Hatter. I also would've liked the angle I proposed earlier, with the Red Queen appearing completely as the Queen of Hearts and facing Suits rather than the White Army in the end. It would have made more sense to me.<br/><br/>But this is Wonderland; a world of adventure, not logic; of madness, not sanity; of childlike wonder, not cynical criticism. Some say this movie lacked heart; I say the heart is where this movie's strength truly rested. I came close to walking into the movie with my mind made-up, having already decided what it had done ""wrong"" and how it ""should"" be. In that sense, I was a little like Alice, falling into a world she had visited before, facing a host of changes, firmly convinced that she would wake up at any moment to what she ""knew"" was right. I decided not to be that way; not to lose, in the words of the Hatter, my ""muchness"".<br/><br/>So, if you want to be like Alice, constantly trying to make sense of the madness in this movie, then that's up to you; but I recommend, instead of falling into the rabbithole, you jump in with both feet.<br/><br/>(read the original review at: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Fourth-day-Universe/139492888998)"
"jdesando","Null","1","4","6 March 2010"," Mad as a Hatter
","""There is a place. Like no place on Earth. A land full of wonder, mystery, and danger! Some say to survive it: You need to be as mad as a hatter."" The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) <br/><br/>More than appreciating Tim Burton's visually stunning sequel to Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, I couldn't stop thinking how perfectly Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter: The infamous character is clearly disturbed but a good heart dedicated to stopping the bad heart, big-headed Red Queen, played with relish by Helena Bonham Carter. Depp is one actor who could do six impossible things before breakfast.<br/><br/>As arguably the most versatile actor in film, Depp almost always is superior (except as Dillinger, where he underplayed the flamboyant gangster), so my thoughts run to how an actor is the embodiment of a film, in this case the eccentric Hatter as the center of imagination and iconoclasm, just what Carroll ordered for his anti-establishment cartoon lampooning Victorian society and ushering in the age of individualism.<br/><br/>The tea party is still there with the March Hare (Paul Whitehouse) and Dormouse (Babs Windsor), but it's less whimsical and more morbid than in Carroll. Alice in Wonderland loses the original's innocence as the film moves to the unoriginal conclusion with its dragon Jabberwocky (Christopher Lee) no different from scores of other dragons in other fantasies. Even Alice's (Mia Wasikowski) heroics are derivative. As always Alan Rickman's voice has the ability to mesmerize, this time as the slow but effective blue caterpillar Absolem.<br/><br/>Burton has put all his weird makeup and love of bizarre characters into this film, which more than any of his other fantasies such as Edward Scissorhands and Corpse Bride echoes the epic struggles of good and evil in most kiddie, young adult, and cheesy romances over the ages."
"kotrynamacca","8","2","15","5 March 2010"," The most vivid dream you've ever experienced...
","So, I just got back from seeing this film. Maybe film isn't the right term for it- maybe visual stunner is. Visually, it was quite an amazing ride. The animals who talked, the strange evaporating cat, Johnny Depp's crazy makeup, Helena Bonham Carter's big head, and the fantastic color and scenery...it made Wonderland quite wondrous. It was like a very vivid, crazy, and quite random dream. The characters were hilarious and truly fascinating, especially the March Hare! I think that little skinny hare with that Scottish accent of his stole the whole movie! Unfortunately, he had too few of lines! The best part of the movie was the animals. The Cheshire Cat, voiced so brilliantly by Stephen Fry, was the most unforgettable character to be sure. Alan Rickman also gave a quick, but meaty and satisfying performance as- none other than- a blue caterpillar! <br/><br/>There was plenty of humor, and I think most viewers will agree with me on this. Helena Bonham Carter was the female actor who stole the show from the others- being Mia Wasikowska and Anne Hathaway. Bonham Carter happens to be one of my favorite actresses because of her amazing uniqueness on screen. She has distinct looks, a great charisma, and a screen-presence hardly surpassed by any other female actor. Though her character may not have a great backstory, the character is understood. Bonham Carter provides for many laughs and good entertainment. Alice, played by Mia Wasikowska, was quite dry. There was no climax for her character (well, there really was no climax in the whole movie), and she did not change from beginning to end. All characters were static. Maybe the dryness wasn't Mia's fault...it's possible it was the fault of the script. Other than the fact she should have been more expressive and emotional, there's not too much I can say that is a fault on her part. Also, I understand working with CGI is very tough on actors, as they don't see the characters they are talking to while filming as we see them on screen. Talking into a blue-screen has its challenges for conveying full emotion and expression. However, I've still seen other actors do much better jobs with CGI. Then, there was Anne Hathaway--the White Queen--who gave one of the poorest performances of the movie. Such a hollow and lacking portrayal that it hurt me to watch her. She added no beauty, grace, sophistication, or allure to the White Queen. And her makeup! What happened there?? The makeup was so unflattering that it made an otherwise quite beautiful actress quite ugly! The white hair did not work with the dark lips and jet black eyebrows. She looked like some sort of goth girl. Another awful performance was by Crispin Glover, who played Stayne. I don't think I've seen much worse an actor can do than what he did on screen. It is sad that Tim Burton did not notice his terrible acting... Now, we can talk about Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter. Let's face it- no other actor could have fit the role. He played the Hatter to the best of his ability recognizing the shortcomings of the script itself. Basically, the Mad Hatter is insane. He's a crazy and whimsical character who needs to be as crazy as he can to stand out of (or to simply deal with) the craziness of all others. To live in a world like that, you'd have to be a bit mad or off-your-rocker. Summarizing the role- he's a hatter who is mad! There's not much else to him...at least not much else that the script allows to really show. Depp plays him a bit confusingly and differing from moment to moment, but that is what the Mad Hatter is supposed to be like. He's got his cute accents, his smart moments, his ""wtf?"" moments, his simply hilarious moments, his touching moments, and his dark moments. And the makeup screams ACID TRIP! As for the clothes-- you can't take them all in at once. Only at the end of the movie did I realize the Hatter was wearing a kilt the whole time. Oh boy...the performance was quite all over the place, but it worked for the character, and I'm sure Depp meant to do everything he did and meant to come off as he did. Being very familiar with Depp's work, I know what great acting skill he has, and if a character comes off a certain way, Depp meant him to, and the director meant him to.<br/><br/>So, as for the movie as a whole, it lacked a decent and well-organized plot. And even for people (like me) who aren't very familiar with Lewis Carroll's books, the story is very verrrryyy predictable. There are no twists or surprises. Without the visual effects, the movie would be nothing. Certain characters also add a lot of substance to the movie. Alice in Wonderland is a concoction of beautiful and engaging sights with humor and madness. That's what it is. It is not something that will mentally engage you. But, nevertheless, it will entertain you. A great movie to see on a Friday night after a long day at work. Your eyes are in for a treat! There is barely a purpose or message to this film...just loads of eye-candy that will make you wish you lived in Wonderland. It's a fantasy world that really comes alive in 3-D. The plot will not impress you though. And some of the acting could be a lot better. And it isn't always a very smooth ride. Oh well... It's like a dream! A dream world...a sort of land that is housed in your imagination. It is random and weird, but creative and filled with energy. I'm probably going to see it again in theaters...just to get a second look and see if any of my opinions change. I don't really know if it's worth another 13 bucks though.<br/><br/>Well...7.5-8/10 because it definitely could be improved."

","Arghh, Burton yet again manages to ruin another Disney classic, this ""interpretation"" was an overwhelming disappointment. Don't even rent the garbage. The visuals are great, but so not worth sitting through the movie for.<br/><br/>The story was butchered into a Good vs. Evil plot; it looks as if it was just lifted off Narnia. The characters were made dull and boring and you never really care about any of them, especially the lead who experiences no character development. The movie just feels awkward throughout and can't seem to decide whether it's a kids movie or not.<br/><br/>You got Hathaway prancing around like a lobotomized Jack Sparrow, Depp being intermittently possessed by a Scottish demon, a bunch of other characters that just feel uncomfortable and out-of-place, and a female lead going through the entire movie with about two expressions.<br/><br/>The only character that was even slightly interesting was Bonham Carter's queen and I ended up rooting for her hoping the Jabberwocky would kill Alice and just end the movie. Good job Burton, you've managed to sap the life out of another classic with your turd."

","In all honesty, this is now my new favorite Tim Burton movie. Sweeney Todd was first but now Alice beat it. But why all the hating?! What was there not to like about this movie? Everything was excellent about this movie especially Johnny Depp's performance as the Mad Hatter. My favorite character in terms of adorableness is the Cheshire Cat, who was totally cute in this version. I loved his apearing and disappearing ability. The only character I did not like was the Red Queen (not because she's the bad guy and she's supposed to not be liked) but because she got on my nerves with her off with the head phrase constantly being used and her yelling frequently. But overall this movie is a fantastic new version of a classic story from the master Tim Burton."

","(And Alice came for the ride).<br/><br/>This is not a remake of any Alice in Wonderland film. Nor is it a film made from the book. It is a re-imagining of the Lewis Carol story that will not appeal to everyone. It clumsily splices the two books (""Alice"" and ""Looking glass"") together and the result is a film that somehow manages to hang together and is actually quite entertaining.<br/><br/>This film has almost everything against it. A Gothic director who destroyed Charlie and the Chocolate Factor (though I am a fan of his other work). A non existent set comprised of green screens that would make even George Lucas have a fit . Matt Lucas' vocal talents. The list goes on but while this film should be the worst thing ever to hit our screens it turned out to be pretty good.<br/><br/>This film features Johnny Depp as the mad hatter (who's part in the tale has increased fourfold) and Mia Wasikowska (chosen for her ""gravity"") as Alice. Both pull off reasonable performances, however, Depp's acting can be cringing at parts and Mia can be wooden.<br/><br/>My only other snipe at this film is the fact that it's not all that child friendly. Mr Burton this is a children's story, not Pan's Labyrinth. Images such as a large creatures eyes being pulled out and a lake of heads are among those I'm not too sure are suitable for children but there you go. <br/><br/>So if you're in for a bizarre fantasy story that doesn't really make sense why not give it a go. I doubt you're gonna want to see a hundred times but the film is certainly one of the collection."
"mjburr","6","1","5","11 June 2010"," Reducing Gold to Dross
","I looked forward to this movie since the story has been a favorite for years and I've also have been a great fan of Jonny Depp. I have to say I finished the movie disappointed on two counts. My biggest disappointment was in the the way the writers took Mr. Carrol's wonderful story of nonsensical lightness and turned it into yet another Hollywood tale of cops and robbers or cowboys and indians. The delightfulness of the original story has been hacked into unrecognizable pieces by conflating Carroll's two stories and the Jabberwocky poem. The emphasis on violence is particularly disturbing and makes it evident the screenwriters had neither the heart or wit of Lewis Carroll. It makes the film unsuited for small children. When these stories were given to these screen writers it was a case of casting pearls before swine.<br/><br/>Mr. Depp's role as the Mad Hatter was interesting but not great. Largely it seemed a reprise of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Perhpas the Buton/Depp collaboration has gotten stale."

","Here in the latest Tim Burton extravaganza, a greatly anticipated event, we see the exciting overlap of two very interesting journeys.<br/><br/>Lewis Carroll's famous novel has been adapted several times in the many years since its first publication. Among these interpretations are the delightfully quirky television adaptation in 1999 – with an all-star cast including Martin Short and Miranda Richardson – and the childishly submissive Disney cartoon version in 1951.<br/><br/>Though Burton's take on the classic tale is notably divergent from the others, and a splendid addition wealth of psychedelic triumphs. His trail of achievements is very often spoken of and highly praised. He has experimented with many genres, and it is a pleasure to see him try his hand at winsome frivolous fantasy-adventure.<br/><br/>However, the reception of this film has been rather dismal, because this is also undoubtedly more commonplace than most of his other works. Rather than simply retelling an already well-known and fully comprehended story, and one that Burton believed to be very disjointed anyway with its unintelligible jumble of isolated episodes, a smoother and later-occurring narrative has been created in its place. This story might undeniably be the typical tale of courage, good and evil, rebellion, and overcoming obstacles against all odds, but it is still such a winner, even if it drags on at times as though its audience is clueless as to its conclusion.<br/><br/>Thankfully though, all is agreed that the technical aspects are genius. Burton favourite Danny Elfman provides yet another commendable musical score, and the big man has fun with the special effects team in designing the mystical world of Underland through stunning scenery created with CGI and digital tweaking of some of the actors' faces.<br/><br/>And indeed, what an impressive selection of stars the cast is.<br/><br/>Australian newcomer Mia Wasikowska is most convincing in the title role. In this version Alice is a young lady of nineteen, and she is under enormous pressure to quickly make tough life-changing decisions. This is all depicted in a pleasingly worthwhile first couple of sequences. It is when the stress overwhelms her that she pursues the iconic tardy, smartly-dressed white rabbit (voiced by Michael Sheen) down the hole and into Wonderland. However, the incredible universe from her childhood is hardly a refuge, as once she enters she finds herself in the heavily demanding position of ""Chosen One"", as proclaimed by the all-knowing caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman).<br/><br/>Burton's wife, the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter, is stupendously nasty in the role of the hideous tyrant the Red Queen. This monster has enslaved the land with her vicious pet the Jabberwocky (voiced briefly by horror legend Christopher Lee, also something of a Burton regular), the beast that Alice must slay.<br/><br/>Crispin Glover emits menace and spite as the Red Queen's ruthless Knave of Hearts, her right-hand man and a vile sycophant; and the charming Anne Hathaway has fun playing her sweet and ditsy sister the White Queen, who leads the force of good.<br/><br/>And lastly, Burton's most famous muse, the immensely talented Johnny Depp, shines in the role of the Mad Hatter, performing with great energy and impact. A slight yet distinct Capt. Jack Sparrow flair comes through at times with this wacky yet wise and noble character, and his presence hugely elevates his scenes.<br/><br/>In short, Alice in Wonderland comfortably forgoes being a masterpiece to instead deliver softer and more accessible entertainment."
"wbusch","6","1","5","11 March 2010"," Alice in Wonderland - not really
","This movie has a fresh and updated look. Tim Burton's interpretation stays relatively true to the original version. One thing that is lacking is any depth to the characters. This is unusual for Tim Burton and Disney. The most noticeable weakness is that the 3D is old school Disney theme park. After the superb 3D in Avatar this movie falls far behind. Some scenes are overdone and the images are ""in your face"" while other scenes are more like a regular 2D movie. Whereas Avatar 3D seemed like you were viewing the scene in person Alice both overwhelms and underwhelms the senses. It is like watching a movie in which the scenes randomly change from color to black and white repeatedly. Johnny Dep fails to captivate or illuminate his character. One would have hoped this version would have become a classic like its predecessor but that is not the case."

Johnny Depp is the maddest of the hatters. The Cheshire cat's grin is infectious and the blue caterpillar takes full advantage of the 3D effects. New creatures to tame and ride, a talking dog, a talking horse all seem reasonable in this world. The level of violence and too many needles into eyes may not be appropriate for younger children.<br/><br/>Alice shrinks, grows and grows along her journey in this girl power classic.

"neil-476","7","1","5","11 March 2010"," All style, no substance, little Carroll
","I've tried to figure out why this movie doesn't quite work, and I think it must be the script. It can't be story, because Carroll's two Alice books aren't exactly over-burdened with plot: they are like nothing so much as Victorian videogames - Alice enters alien environment and traverses a series of obstacles to be overcome/defeated/avoided until she reaches the final objective, to return home. The books are linear and episodic, and so is this movie.<br/><br/>So if it's not story it must be something else. The Alice books are characterised by their imagination, wit, charm, and originality. Burton's film is imaginative (most of which derives from the books and Tenniel's illustrations), but it isn't very original, neither does it exhibit much wit or charm. Burton does add his own flavour, but that has never been particularly charming.<br/><br/>The story - ""Return to Wonderland"" - adds so little of its own, and is so heavily dependent on material from the source novels, that one wonders why it was considered necessary to go for a ""sequel"", and why Burton didn't simply film the book/s.<br/><br/>And this is a shame, because it always looks good (fantastic, in fact, in every sense of the word, although the 3D isn't always effective or in service to the movie), and has some other elements which are worthwhile, chief among which is the performance of Mia Wasikowska as Alice. Depp's Mad Hatter is enjoyable if somewhat out of alignment with Carroll's vision (the occasional channelling of what appears to be Braveheart's William Wallace is interesting, if distracting), and I felt that much of the remaining talent was miscast - or, perhaps, cast to deliberately go against type - Stephen Fry, Alan Rickman and Barbara Windsor, in particular, failed to convince me that they were Carroll's Cheshire Cat, Caterpillar and Dormouse. And this was ironic considering the degree of discussion there was as to whether Alice was the real Alice or not.<br/><br/>Regrettably, there were a number of things which really irritated me, too. Chief among these was the tendency of the script to attribute names - how long has the Caterpillar had a name, for instance? I was irritated by the affectionate diminution of Cheshire Car to ""Chess"" - ""Chesh"", surely? And I wish someone had actually read Through The Looking Glass and realised that the critter in question is called the Jabberwock, not Jabberwocky (which is the name of the poem in which it appears), although it was good to see it modelled on Tenniel's illustration. Finally, I was less than thrilled with Helena Bonfire Carter's wholesale lift from Miranda Richardson's Queenie (plagiarism, dearie). You don't have to put the missus in ALL your movies, Tim! Oddly, the bit of the film which I felt worked best was the wholly original framing sequence which lent some depth to Alice's character. <br/><br/>Otherwise, this was a typical Burton example of style over substance."
"daves_train","8","1","5","10 March 2010"," What I expected and more
","I went to see this film and I felt worried that Johnny Depp was going to be the main focus of the film and the trailer made me worry that the March Hare was going to be just some one liner machine. I was very surprised when I found out that this was a good movie. I read reviews on this site and from Roger Ebert and so on but it is a follow up to the books. The CGI was very good and it sucked me into the story. Now I love Tim Burton and Alice in Wonderland and you could easily screw up on Alice in Wonderland if you don't do it right but I got a happy mix. There was only one during the film that made me cringe in embarrassment.<br/><br/>During the end, after the Jaberwocky is killed and the Queen taken away. The Mad Hatter does a really goofy dance but it only lasts a few seconds.<br/><br/>Alice is fairly balanced and wanted to see her adventures in this screwed up place. I have to warn parents though you might want to take their kids. This movie is not afraid to get gruesome because there is three eye gouging, one hand stab and a lot of decapitated heads. I say this because I took my little brother and I was worried that he was going to have adverse effects.<br/><br/>I think this movie is great, the CG compliments the story and the characters are all developed."

","OK, so Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" is really over-the-top, and basically an ego trip for Burton. But it is really neat to watch (especially in 3-D, like I saw it). By now, you've probably heard that it's set ten years after the original story, and Alice (Mia Wasikowska of ""Defiance"") returns to Wonderland to find that her destiny is to slay the Jabberwocky on Frabjous Day.<br/><br/>Obviously, they can't totally recreate the book's spirit, especially since they're changing the story a little bit. But Burton's version retains Lewis Carroll's sensibility more than Disney's 1951 animated feature (which went too much for being cute, and not enough for being irreverent).<br/><br/>The best character is definitely Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. Of course, I wouldn't expect anything less from Depp. Almost as good is Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous Red Queen. Most of the cast is composed of a who's who of UK cinema*, with some token Americans (Anne Hathaway as the White Queen, and Crispin Glover as the Knave of Hearts).<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is exaggerated almost to the point of being sort of silly, but that's appropriate for this sort of movie. I certainly liked it.<br/><br/>*To be precise, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Alan Rickman, Imelda Staunton, Timothy Spall, and even two cast members from the Hammer movies (Christopher Lee and Michael Gough)."

","Special effects were a dream come true! I was so amazed at how smoothly the story went. There were a few loud action scenes that might startle small children but no blood or gore. Half the movie was spent trying to figure out if ""This"" Alice was the correct Alice in their prophecy. They could have used that time to explore more of Wonderland IMHO. They combined the queens from both books the Red Queen of Hearts VS. the White Queen of Chess. That did not make sense to me, but then again it is Wonderland. I think if the original author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll would have seen it I think he would have enjoyed it very much seeing his books come to life. But I think if Tim Burton had just remade The original books it would have been better. My only complaint was the ending. It was not what I was hoping for. Otherwise it is a must see for all ages especially in 3D! Enjoy!"

","There have been numerous versions of Alice in Wonderland, but Tim Burton's take on the famous story is a welcome addition. By bringing in some new plot lines and a different theme, Burton injects a bit of fresh energy into what is a well-known tale. We find Alice now entering womanhood, trying to fend off the unwanted marriage plans of a sickly aristocratic oik. Finding herself back in Wonderland, Alice has little recollection of her earlier visits; was it all a dream she wonders. As she travels further into Wonderland, she encounters many of the familiar faces, and they were portrayed very effectively. The Cheshire Cat was brilliantly voiced by Stephen Fry, whilst Alan Rickman did a fine turn as the caterpillar. Johnny Depp was an intriguing mad hatter and Helena Bonham Carter was good as the egocentric 'off with their heads' Red Queen, complete with bulbous head and giant red hair. The 3D special effects were good and made a good film that little bit richer. The colours were vibrant and the action scenes interesting. The film is obviously pitched at a younger audience, but has plenty of entertaining moments for parents too. Overall, the latest Alice flick was good fun."

","Greetings again from the darkness. A sequel?? How dare they? When I first heard that Tim Burton was taking on Lewis Carroll's story, I was very excited. What better director to take on this most peculiar work than the man who brought us Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Beetlejuice, Batman and others? The man is a visual genius. But a sequel?? <br/><br/>Early in the film, we find an almost 20 year old Alice being proposed to in front of a large crowd of high society types. She spots a rabbit in the bushes and excuses herself, chases the rabbit, and quickly falls down the rabbit hole. The wild ride begins.<br/><br/>Mr. Burton's visual feast takes Alice (Mia Wasikowska) through many of the situations we (and she) are familiar with. The main difference is this is her ""return"" trip to Wonderland and she is no longer a little girl. She is told her destiny is to defeat the Jabberwocky so that the evil Red Queen's ruling power can be assumed by her sister, the good white queen. This destiny takes Alice through many sites and characters we don't often see.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is cast as her friend the Mad Hatter. His ""mad"" look is achieved through a bird's nest of red hair, giant yellow saucer-sized eyes and make-up that would make Lady Gaga jealous. The Red Queen, who captures the Hatter, is played wonderfully by Mr. Burton's wife, Helena Bonham Carter. She has marvelous voice inflections and is as quick with an ""off with their heads"" as she is a ""I need a pig"". Her sister, the White Queen, is played oddly but beautifully by Anne Hathaway. The sibling rivalry is a hoot.<br/><br/>We are treated to voice work from three of the best ever: Christopher Lee, Michael Gough and Alan Rickman. Unfortunately, Mr. Lee and Mr. Gough have VERY limited lines, but it was nice of them to contribute. Also contributing are Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall and Matt Lucas.<br/><br/>Once I adjusted to the fact that this was not a re-imagining of the original works, but rather more of a sequel or next step, the film worked fine for me. What I missed was the amazing word play of the great Lewis Carroll. Of course, anyone who actually understood his writings will probably be a bit bored with this version. Luckily, that affects very few! <br/><br/>Mr. Burton's visuals are successful and will probably appeal to most ages. The 3-D seems to have been an after-thought and is most effective with the really cool Cheshire cat. The youngest kids will struggle to follow the Mad Hatter's accent-heavy dialogue, but the pictures and characters (Tweedle-Dee and Dumb) should be enough to keep them entertained."

","Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a excellent fun filled film. Lots of laughs, with good acting on Johnny Dept's part, and good acting on Mia Wasikowska part as Alice. This movie was good with or without 3D effects. I will admit that some of the writing for the film was not that great, like some of the lines that was given to Dept did not make much sense, and with Mr. Caterpillar getting high, it was a little to adult like for a Disney movie. But, despite a few flaws, I still found it to be very entertaining, and very funny. I also liked all the breathtaking CGI that made wonderland come to life. And I must admit that this movie is in fact a lot better then the re-make of Willy Wonka. It is just a great film to see, do not go by bad reviews, this is for yourself."

","I wanted to say I loved it but I can't. It was pretty to view, and I have to admit that it was worth the price of admission. However after seeing Burton do Sweeny Todd such justice, with his darker vision, I expected more.<br/><br/>To be pithy; here is why this film went down the rabbit-hole for me:<br/><br/>Aside from the ""Queen"" the cast including Depp, Hathaway, and some good character actors, were not used to great measure. There was no real connection between them and the audience. As in The Wizard of Oz and Narnia we wanted to join the quest. Here we were merely hitch hikers through a living Nightmare Before Alice.<br/><br/>And perhaps it's just me If I am going to see a retelling of a classic story, regardless of its popularity, then please retell it. I mean how many people would read Alice in Wonderland if it were published again word for word by a different author? Why are storytellers on film so different? I man after all were talking Tim Burton, not Gus Van Sant or Rob Zombie. You are truly a different caliber director.<br/><br/>Without the beautiful effects it's a meandering Neverending Story. I think Burton is a visionary ""Gothic"" director. I just don't think he added enough of his staple to this. Perhaps if it were darker, LIKE TODD, it would have added something to a story that has been done to a Madhatter's TEA!"

Alice goes back down the hole for the second time, only this time there is a plot to it. It takes place in the same place called ""wonderland"", or as the locals call it, ""underland"". All the original characters are there; the Mad Hatter played Oh so well by Johnny Depp, the White Rabbit, Matty the Doormouse, Absolum, Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dumb, the Cheshire Cat, the Red Queen, the White Queen, the Bandersnatch, the Jabberwoky, and of course Alice played very well by Mia Wasikowska. I don't remember Crispin Glover's character, (the Red Queens right hand man) in the original book, although it's been many many years since I read it. There is a surprise waiting for Alice who is confused as to everyone's conversation about her being the ""the right Alice"" or not. It contains, action, drama, and comedy in good equal proportions. The cinematography is beautifully done. I will enjoy this movie for years to come. The musical soundtrack is equally stunning. I can't say ANYTHING bad about this movie."

I believe that giving it a more ""conventional"" story-line ( as reviewers have complained ) was a wise choice for this latest adaption . . rather then portraying the books more accurately with a series of ""wordy"" encounters with whimsical & fantastical characters.<br/><br/>But even more, in reaction to some of the other write-ups here, I don't know how so many are seeing Depp's Hatter as some combination of Wonka & Sparrow ! That simply seems like projecting ones knowledge of Depp's earlier roles, as the Hatter is new & unique, yet played by Johnny Depp. Neither is Alice acted in a ""wooden"" fashion.

","Many years after Alice's first adventure in underland, a now late teens Alice returns to thr magical place that feels like a strange dream for her.<br/><br/>I cannot say I've read the original book, so I can't comment on how far it strays from the story, I do understand that this was meant as a kind of sequel rather than a straight adaptation. Tim Burton has definitely put his own touch on the characters, of which I thought Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen was the standout winner, even over a usually crazier than anyone Johnny Depp, the Mad Hatter, who seemed to me more of a manacly depressed hatter. I found myself routing for the Evil Red Queen over the strangely goth like White Queen in Anne Hathaway, as she was much more entertaining. I particularly found amusing the Red Queens abuse of animals, playing Croquet with flamingoes and hedgehogs and using a pig as a footstool, also every time someone anyoed her she would shout ""off with their head"".<br/><br/>I also have issues with films that were never supposed to be in 3D from day one and then decide to go 3D as an after thought, when done properly 3D can really add an extra dimension, if you will, to a film but when added at a later date it feels gimmicky, like the film companies are just using it as a way of charging an extra £2.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I think I set my expectations too high and was sorely disappointed with a very mediocre film."

The White Queen had these annoying hand movements we couldn't ignore and her palace and helpers were all rather uninspired. That character could have been a lot more creative. The Red Queen's pirate friend had awkward CGI movements and he too could have been a more creative character.

","Ebert says the ending is hollow and far below the level of its preceding scenes. He's right, but I wasn't as upset about it as he was. It's a convention to end a movie that way and though it was definitely an opportunity to do much better, it's familiar and a fairly good way to back out of a pleasant experience.<br/><br/>And then there's Disenchanted's barb stating that Burton may be a better set designer than director. He may be right as the sets are very, very good while the movie has rather obvious flaws. Still I was more often caught up in this Burton film than I have in any of his others. I think he's reached a new level as a director, achieving something quite difficult to capture, a dream-like quality as a child would have experienced it. That's not bad.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Depp's and Bonham-Carter's performances the most though I was quite happy with Mia Wasikowska's as well. She has a wonderfully light touch that I found easy to accept as lead, even as an young English maiden. There's something about her that makes her an ideal guide and though Burton shows much more intense vision in this film than in his others, she's especially integral to it and the movie would have suffered greatly without her.<br/><br/>All in all a good movie, with many brilliant parts."
"FlashCallahan","8","1","6","6 March 2010"," Off with your head.........
","With all the trouble Surrounding the films release (in the UK at least) i had very low expectations for the film. The trailer was average, and it seems that Burton had gone back to Planet Of The Apes Status. How wrong i was.<br/><br/>If you are expecting Burton circa, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands or Batman, you will be sorely disappointed. If you were a fan of Charlie and the chocolate factory, and like a lot of weird and wonderful characters that really do not amount to much, this will entertain.<br/><br/>The story is basically that Alice has forgot about her first trip to 'Underland' and returns after rejecting a marriage proposal. When she returns to Underland, she discovers that she is the only one who can defeat the Jabberwocky, and adventure starts there.<br/><br/>The film is quite similar to 'Hook' in many ways, the main protagonist has forgotten about her life in Underland, probably due to the fact that she lost her father and he was the only one who brought some life and wonderment to her life. Once her dad died, all the magic and creation was lost from her life, so she only recalls Underland in her subconscious.<br/><br/>And then we spend quite a bit of time with the original characters trying to remind her of her previous adventure. It sounds quite difficult to watch, but in fact, thanks to the 3-D and some very bizarre CGI, the film runs very briskly and is very funny, albeit a little dark at times.<br/><br/>Depp as always, steals the show as the Hatter, him sounding one moment like Groundskeeper Willie, the next like Sweeny Todd, and the dance he does at the end is hilarious and psychedelic. Hathaway is a little too Jack Sparrow for my liking, and doesn't really add anything to the film. <br/><br/>Bonham Carter and Glover are fine as the villain, but they too begin to grate as the film goes on. Good job then to the newcomer who plays Alice. Although she has a big job to do, in keeping up with some bizarre visuals and some huge talent, she manages to keep the character interesting and endearing.<br/><br/>Thankfully, it's a really good movie, with a very good narrative and good editing. Thankfully the connotations to drugs are not very obvious, but they are there, and although some of the 3-D is in your face, it does assist the film and Hinder it at times.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Depp ala Pirates, Willy Wonka and Todd, you really will enjoy this."
"griffolyon12","6","1","6","5 March 2010"," Blockbuster-ified Fairy Tale
","I adore fairy tales. Fantastical stories that take you to other worlds and have no rhyme or reason, they simply are and exist, without any complex explanation. Of course, now there are blockbuster-ified fairy tales. If that's what you want, then director Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is for you.<br/><br/>This is not your ordinary Alice in Wonderland, it's actually a vague sequel to the original story, but rather than being an adaptation of the legitimate sequel penned by Lewis Carroll (Through the Looking Glass), it is an odd jumble of a story that seems as if it was dreamed up in a board room. Alice has been to Wonderland before, but cannot remember it. When she is 19 and faced with the horrible decision as to whether or not to marry her horrible suitor, Alice falls down the rabbit hole once more, rediscovers Wonderland, and learns that she is the only one who can usurp the Red Queen by slaying her all powerful dragon in a Lord of the Rings-esquire climax.<br/><br/>It isn't fair to say Alice in Wonderland is a bad film, just cliché where it could have been so much more. One would think the marriage of bizarre director Tim Burton with the Lewis Carroll classic would be a perfect pairing, but the film was bogged down into the realm of cliché action/adventure. The film kind of plays out like a Lord of the Rings light. We must get this ancient sword, take it to the White Queen, and then Alice must challenge the Red Queen's dragon and slay it to save Wonderland. Am I the only one who finds something wrong with this? Alice in Wonderland is a fantasy, and not an action/adventure epic, but more of a fantasy that is more about the characters and not the epic backdrop. Speaking of fantasy, time was never taken to drink in the fantastical, to truly experience Wonderland, we would just hop on over to the next piece of the Hollywood puzzle. Still, there is a good amount to enjoy in the film.<br/><br/>Unlike most Tim Burton films, this isn't a macabre film that is simply macabre for no other reason than to be macabre. It is actually a kid-friendly film, and for Burton, is not weird at all, it is just true to the spirit of Lewis Carroll's story. The film is strikingly the most commercial friendly Burton film since the original Batman in 1989, and even though I was disappointed that the film was more of a big blockbuster than a straight up fantasy (like the books), the action/adventure elements were played well. While it was all a touch cliché, the dueling the dragon and the big epic battle at the end, was at least entertaining, even if it didn't feel like Alice in Wonderland. Not to mention, the characters are exceedingly charming. Johnny Depp is fascinating as the Mad Hatter, as well, Mia Wasikowska, who plays Alice, shines and is definitely a star in the making.<br/><br/>I think my greatest disappointment came with this film in seeing that the cast was all pitch perfect and the design of Wonderland was fantastic, not to mention a great many moments within the film showed promise of being one of those unforgettable movie moments, but none of that ever came to fruition and was just bogged down by the mechanics of the studio system. Really, the film is entertaining enough to watch, but repeat viewings really aren't desired, and by this film's favoring of cliché Hollywood blockbuster story over originality and straight up fantasy, it keeps the film from being something more memorable down the road.<br/><br/>I give Alice in Wonderland a 6 out of 10!"
"JemStonePro","7","1","6","5 March 2010"," Great Style but Lack in Story
","Alice in Wonderland is a movie that takes you on a trip through a world of colorful imagination. It does not follow exactly the Disney animated version but all the same characters are present. The costume and set design sets this film apart and gives it a unique artistic style. But what makes the movie is Johnny Depp, as the Mad Hatter. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp does a brilliant job creating a character that brings life to the film. His ability to use all aspects of acting from verbal lines to body language and gestures is fantastic. The Mad Hatters great lines, giving credit to Linda Woolverton for writing, brought a comedic touch to the film, while not distracting from the story line. The design of his costume is so intricate down to the eye color that it just brings his character to life.<br/><br/>As the film progresses we are taken into a true wonderland of color and design that is much different than other films. From the costumes of each character, to the set, each had a story to tell. The use of color did not give it a cartoon feel, yet you still got the feel of being in another world.<br/><br/>Mia Wasikowska, who plays Alice, was not the best choice of actresses for the part. She performs well but in the beginning her performance is not as believable as it could have been. There is supposed to be a change in attitude in the character though the film. She shows that through her acting, but it was nothing spectacular by any means. She has the new age acting, where the acting is very life like, and almost purposely mistake like. The storyline is not anything superb but it flows and keeps the viewer involved, the design and feel of the movie is what sets it apart from most other films."

"garlonuss","7","1","7","5 March 2010"," Alice in the Palace
","It's definitely one of the more commercially marketable Tim Burton movies, which may be a result of doing it with Disney. But there are a few little drawbacks for me. I like Mia Wasikowska as Alice in general, but there are a few times when she didn't seem to be emoting quite enough. She seems to act out the gravity of her situation well enough, in general, but, for instance, in the scene where she finds the small door and keeps getting big and small until she can get through the door, it simply felt like she was doing the actions because the script told her to. I may have been expecting too much, but it seemed like she was just going through the steps.<br/><br/>Also, the 3D aspect feels a bit inconsistent. At times, there are some nicely impressive shots, but at other times it doesn't seem all that different from a 2D film. I had heard that Tim Burton shot the film with a standard camera and then had the footage processed into 3D (sort of like what they did with the Nightmare Before Christmas 3D) so that may have made me more critical when I watched it and maybe I'm being a bit too harsh, but there it is.<br/><br/>Other than those issues, the visual aspect of the movie is actually quite creative, inventive, ... um ... made-up-I've, and ... Tim-Burton-I've. Don't expect the original Alice story. (Either one, since many people are content to forget that the Tweedles are actually from ""Through the Looking-Glass"", not ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"".) Tim Burton has restructured the story since he felt--and rightly so--that Alice's stories are more a series of short encounters rather than one overarching story. The restructured story now ties it all into one meaningful adventure, and I think it works quite well.<br/><br/>On the whole, not my favorite Burton, but it's a good movie and I feel comfortable recommending it. (Though unless you feel you really have to see it in 3D, you should probably save your money and see the 2D version as it doesn't really take full advantage of the possibilities of the 3D format.)"

","I have to be honest: while Tim Burton is certainly unique and creative people need to stop overrating him so much. Like I said you can be overrated and still very good, but come on people he's done this off kilter art style enough times by now that it's nothing new or special. He's certainly not a one trick pony, but people need to stop putting him on some kind of pedestal.<br/><br/>Now that that's out of the way I'd like to say that I did enjoy the movie. I always welcome a fresh take on old media IF IT'S DONE PROPERLY. The story wasn't very fresh in itself but served well enough for everything else to happen. The CGI didn't really bother me, I mean what did people expect? It was solid in itself and allowed for this whimsical world to come to life. Without it many things wouldn't have been realized properly.<br/><br/>I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, but didn't feel he did anything special here. I think maybe he's starting to phone in these types of characters having done them so many times already OR didn't want to be the center of attention, the latter being a good thing. I say that because there are so many unique characters you don't want to make it the Johnny Depp show. I could speculate on this for a good while but either way he was all right, it's just that his makeup and costume did a lot of the work I'm sure he'll get credit for and a character drifting in and out of an accent is perplexing and annoying for me.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter was pretty good I must say, although with all the computer graphics I'm not certain how much she was ""in"" the film in the traditional sense. Did they just morph her head to a bigger size, map her face acting on to a CGI body? I have no idea. Regardless I'm willing to say she did well even though the script called for way too many ""off with their heads"" from her.<br/><br/>Overall it was a worthwhile movie to watch and I couldn't red flag anything that would freak out hardcore Alice fans. There just wasn't anything about it that leaps out at you. Just to reaffirm my stance on Burton: All I'm saying is we've seen the twisted tree branches and grim architecture enough times by now. I'd like to see something different.<br/><br/>PS--I was going to give this movie an extra star just because I realized later Crispin Glover was in it but decided to keep it at 7 since Depp's ridiculous dance near the end was done horribly and didn't fit well at all.

"davidmvining","2","0","1","31 March 2020"," Self-serious and lazily built. Tim Burton's lowest point.
","This might be the most inept and lazy epic fantasy adventure attempt I've ever seen. It feels like the most generic script with Alice in Wonderland iconography tacked on as an afterthought. Everything about this movie is wrong. From the visuals to the storytelling to the acting, nothing fits.<br/><br/>So, Alice has grown up and lost all memory of her adventures in Wonderland. She goes out to a rich estate where she is to be engaged to a boorish ginger with an awful mother. As he asks for her hand in about as public a way as possible, she runs off, chasing the white rabbit, where she falls down the rabbit hole and recreates the actions she went through on her first adventures that grow and shrink her to get through a door.<br/><br/>She is then met by a heavily CG'd creation of a world that she never quite feels right in, surrounded by CGI creatures that never feel quite real. Those creatures, the white rabbit, Tweedledee, and Tweedledum show her the prophecy, a roll of parchment that has all of future history on it. I despise prophecies in storytelling. They're lazy when played straight, and they're usually played straight. And Alice in Wonderland plays the prophecy very straight. It feels like the characters are simply looking at the script and hoping that Alice decides to play along. The reveal of the scroll undermines any real tension because we know where the story's going and what's going to happen.<br/><br/>As I rewatched this for the first time in years, I was reminded of Terry Gilliam's Jabberwocky. Both films are essentially adaptations of Lewis Carrol's poem, but Gilliam's is a playful and loose take on the material while Burton's is a weirdly strict retelling of a nonsense poem. The Bandersnatch is a real creature that Alice rides around on. The vorpal blade is a special totem that Alice must claim. The Frabjous Day is the prophesized day that the Jabberwock will be defeated. It's all so literal and it doesn't jive with the nonsensical nature of the source material. Also, prophesies are lazy and I hate them.<br/><br/>Alice moves through this dark and gritty version of Wonderland (that the locals call Underland for...reasons), seeing all the familiar sights but with darker, grittier undertones. There's the caterpillar, the Mad Hatter, and the Cheshire Cat. She makes it to the Red Queen (with an oversized and obviously CG enhanced head that is distracting every moment she's on screen) where she becomes a court favorite under the name Um because she shows up very large and the Queen likes large people. Now, for the little that I like this movie, I do like how the courtiers around the Queen are covered in prosthetics to make individual parts of their bodies larger. This ties in with a criticism that Alice lodged earlier about the ridiculousness of fashions (a codfish on one's head, she imagines). It feels like the single part of the film with any thought behind it. It's also about three minutes of the film.<br/><br/>Alice ends up making her way to the White Queen, the Red Queen's sister, who's flighty. There, it's obvious that Alice will don the armor and take up the vorpal blade because, you know, the prophesy says so. When she makes the arduous decision that the movie told us she was going to make an hour before, there's no sense of elation because we already knew that it was going to happen. Also, what does it say about a movie that's supposedly about a woman becoming independent-minded that she ends up doing exactly what a piece of paper says she'll do? She's not acting on her own, making her own choices, she's falling into pre-determination.<br/><br/>Anyway, the literalness of the storytelling extends to the final big fight that takes place on a checkered field meant to evoke a chess board. Ugh. Alice has this weird moment as she starts her fight with the Jabberwocky where she recalls six impossible things in her adventure up to that point (echoing something her father told her in the flashback that started the movie), but I'm not really sure what it's supposed to accomplish. It comes off very weird and inappropriately delivered for the moment.<br/><br/>And that's the movie. It's weirdly CGI'd to death. Acting is one note all around. Alice's journey of self-discovery actually inverts itself. It's boringly predictable. And it takes itself way, way too seriously at times (like the Hatter's recitation of ""Jabberwocky""). This is easily Tim Burton's worst film."

","I'm a Tim Burton fan in general with movies like Batman and Beetlejuice as well as recent flicks like the new Dumbo, but this film was not made well. For one thing, this feels more as a pseudo sequel to the cartoon than it is a remake. So here's the plot. A grown up Alice RETURNS to wonderland (called underland in this one.) Alice has to fulfill a prophecy to kill this evil dragon owned by the Red Queen. Honestly, this takes everything that made Wonderland great and turned it into an unnecessary war movie. It features Johnny Depp as the Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen, but their performances are beyond over the top, with Depp acting too weird and Carter too loud. Mia Wichowski as Alice was especially bland and not very interesting. The film mostly relies on its 3D, cgi, and visuals when it should rely more on the story at hand. So yeah, this is not one of Burton's better films sadly."

","Think of a stupid super hero movie. Take the action out. Add more saturation to the colors. Boom! You have a Tim Burton movie.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes are satisfying a production request to do a scene from Pride and Prejudice or some other movie in the same style.<br/><br/>Than you get the Alice in Wonderland movie, which is the second feature. And which is full of gratuitous shots. So Alice is falling down the rabbit hole. And also a piano is falling. And many other pieces of furniture.<br/><br/>After the fall, Alice is in the small room. She notices a door. And she tries the door. But none of the others. Because she suddenly turns to the table. From where she takes the key, but does not notice the bottle. Than she tries the tiny key on many large doors she never tried to open. Weird. The moment she opens the small door she again turns to the table to take the bottle. Obviously the character has read the script and knows which items to take in which order. So, Alice takes the bottle and remarks ""it's only a dream"". And nothing gave the audience the hint it is a dream. And she obviously drinks the bottle. Everything once down the rabbit hole happens fast. There is no doubt about the bottle. In stark contrast with the first movie which is terribly slow and pretentious.<br/><br/>And she drinks the contents of the bottle. And she gets small. And Tim Burton is no fool. He knows the dress can't shrink. So Alice disappears in the dress. Only to emerge fully dressed to satisfy the Tim Burton's prudish nature. And one looks at the pointless scene and thinks: well, if one dress can shrink, why can't the other? Simple: than there wouldn't be a need for special effects. And Tim Burton's movie would become cheaper than the average super hero movie."

"rooprect","Null","0","1","22 February 2017"," Call me Mad, but I Hatter really good time.
","The setup of this movie sounds like the beginning of a good joke: ""Tim Burton and Walt Disney walk into a bar..."" You wouldn't think it possible, but it happened. Tim Burton, the master of dark, twisted fantasies where every story involves at least 1 corpse, teamed up with the studio known for bright pink bunnies and such.<br/><br/>The temptation is for Burton fans to expect a Burtonesque flick while Disney fans expect an accurate retelling of the 1951 Disney cartoon classic. Neither happened, not by a longshot.<br/><br/>What happened instead is something you just have to experience. Someone once told me that the root of beauty lies in contrast. A yellow flower in a field of yellow flowers isn't as beautiful as a yellow flower growing on a desolate battlefield of some war-torn desert. So with that in mind, this is a movie for people who can appreciate the contrast between Burton's sarcasm and Disney's innocence. I'll give you an example...<br/><br/>In the Disney cartoon, as well as Lewis Carroll's original story, the Red Queen runs around commanding ""Off with his head!"" at anyone who irritates her, but of course the Red King quietly follows behind whispering ""You're pardoned"" each time, thus saving the executioner a ton of gory axe blades. But in this version, in a brief but stark moment, we learn that the beheadings are quite real. And then bam, we quickly return to Disney territory where we are entertained by the banter of cute talking mice.<br/><br/>Literally, I rubbed my eyes, turned to the person sitting next to me and asked, ""Wait... did we just see a bunch of decapitated heads??"" Confusing at first, this volley between macabre & merry becomes the charm of this film. I should add that I counted at least 3 characters who got an eyeball disgorged. And yet, in Disneyesque fashion you never really feel a sense of menace; it's mostly in good fun.<br/><br/>I purposely didn't mention the plot until now because, to me, the story was secondary to the overall vibe of the film. But in case you're wondering, this is *not* a retelling of Disney's, Carroll's or anyone else's ""Alice in Wonderland"". This is sort of a sequel to the original where Alice, now 19 years old and about to get married, gets reconnected with her long forgotten adventure of youth. In that respect, it reminded me of how the movie ""Hook"" was sort of a sequel to ""Peter Pan"".<br/><br/>To me, that's the only department where this film lost a few points, because it felt like they were weaving too much of a story into a tale that was inherently a stream-of-consciousness that mimicked the randomness of a dream (Lewis Carroll himself invented the story on the spot while rowing Alice Pleasance Liddell and her sisters on a pond). This version follows more of a straighforward plot to defeat the bad guys, and in so doing, it got away from the dreamlike feeling of all other versions I've seen.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp... of course JD steals the show with his alternately endearing and terrifying Mad Hatter. He plays the role as someone suffering from severe PTSD which manifests itself in multiple personalities. There's his normal, gentle, lisping Hatter. And then there's his cruel, dark Scottish Highlander Hatter who sounds like Sean Connery just lost his place in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles.<br/><br/>Honorable mention goes to Crispin Glover (Marty McFly's nerdy father in ""Back to the Future"") who plays a very chilling Jack of Hearts. And another honorable mention goes to Anne Hathaway who plays the angelic but somewhat ditzy White Queen.<br/><br/>Special effects are good for 2010 but a bit dated for today. The best effects are the subtle ones such as the way the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) was depicted as having an enormous, bulbous head. I also thought the ""Drink Me, Eat Me"" scene where Alice shrinks & grows was done very well.<br/><br/>In the end, although I had been expecting something of a trainwreck, I think the odd pairing of Burton & Disney was a success. So what's next? Maybe horror master John Carpenter (""Halloween"") does a teencom with Lindsay Lohan & Jamie Lee Curtis called ""Freaky Friday the 13th""?"
"nmholland","6","0","1","27 February 2016"," Tim Burton Makes Another Lousy Movie. Not Good. Not Bad. Lousy
","Alice in Wonderland is directed by Tim Burton and stars Mia Wasikowska as Alice Kingsley, the ever so famous Disney not- princess. This story is the sequel to - that's right, not a remake - of the Disney classic Alice in Wonderland (1951). Alongside Wasikowska is Johnny Depp as the mad hatter, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen, and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. This story follows Alice at about age 20, on her wedding day, in fact as she falls down the rabbit hole yet again, to find that Underland (that's right, she ""misheard"" the name the first time) is under rule of the Red Queen, or the Queen of Hearts. Under her rule, Underland is now in dismay, and mostly in chaos.<br/><br/>The best thing this film has going for it is the cinematography and directing. Tim Burton, of course, is a good director, and this film shows it. Honestly, this film is beautiful to look at. It's almost all CGI, and almost none of it looks fake. I could tell that a couple shots looked unbelievable, mostly with the White Rabbit, but other than that, it looks great. This is probably due to their big budget of $200 million. However, it doesn't seem that big compared to what they made: $1 billion.<br/><br/>Now, the negatives are more abundant. The first one is the acting. Even Johnny Depp doesn't do that great, and he's an A list actor. Mia Wasikowska does fine. That's all; not good, but not bad either. Just fine. Anne Hathaway does pretty good, although her character is utterly boring. Helena Bonham Carter is definitely the best performance throughout the whole film. We all know she's a good actress, but compared to Johnny Depp, she shouldn't outshine him, which makes for a problem.<br/><br/>The second con is the plot. The plot and dialogue, to be specific. This film's plot has a very convoluted plot, that, at times, doesn't make sense, and completely ditches the audience. My first time watching it, I thought that the Red Queen was a completely different person that the Queen of Hearts from the first movie. I didn't figure out they were the same person until more than half of the way through the film.<br/><br/>The last thing I'll discuss is the ending. This isn't really a spoiler, because I won't say what she does at the ending, just what it's based on. Alice has to become a ""champion"" for the White Queen (fully dressed as a knight), and fight the Jabberwocky, a name mentioned in the original Alice in Wonderland poem. The Jabberwocky is a giant, dragon-like creature that can spew fire from it's jaws. Yeah, the ending is very, very.dumb.<br/><br/>Overall, Alice in Wonderland isn't horrible, but it's far from good. I'm going to give Alice in Wonderland a C-, or a 6 out of 10."

","Tim Burton doesn't always get it right, but here he conflates all the elements of the Alice in Wonderland story into a most charming fantasy. The older real life Alice caught in a moment of intense indecision falls back into Wonderland. Is she the real Alice? That theme runs through the film as we follow her in her new adventures and she meets many of the quirky characters from the real Alice story but now in a different story. <br/><br/>So why does the film work so well? The sets and clothes and characters are deliciously portrayed - a delight in themselves. The pacing is good and the characters wonderfully delineated by the many different actors - the Red Queen, the White Queen, Tweedledum and Tweedledee are particularly vividly portrayed, all acting as a foil to Alice's (Mia Wasikowska) underlying clear headedness and sweetness. Under this delicious fantasy there is a solid storyline - the familiar themes of the battle between good and evil and the finding of one's destiny. There is even just a hint of eroticism as Alice shrinks or grows out of her several fabulous fantasy dresses. <br/><br/>But forget all the underlying themes and just let yourself be fascinated and charmed and excited and thrilled and amused in this lovely fantasy retelling of a wonderful book."

","Alice in Wonderland Tim Burton has out done himself this time with the new and improved ""Alice in Wonderland"". When the first ""Alice in wonderland"" came to theaters it was made for children with vivid imagination, who would be intrigued by animation and color. 2010 was the releasing of the film and made $1,025,467,110 worldwide the 19th highest-grossing film worldwide. This film is a mixture of real- person and animation, it also is full of color yet is dark in places. This film is a step into Tim Burton's mind, it shows how creative he actually is. <br/><br/>The film starts off with a carriage ride to Alice's engagement party. Alice is very different from the rest of the girls, as she is easily distracted and is very open minded. She has an arranged marriage with Hamish, but when he asked for her hand in marriage she takes off after the rabbit instead. When she falls down the rabbit hole its dark with lamps as lighting all through it. She lands in a small dark room with many doors but one tiny door leads her out into wonderland. When Alice enters wonderland it's a dark spooky place with many colors, but not what we imagined it to be. When thinking of wonderland I think of bring colors full of life with beautiful animals running around just a happy place to be. This wonderland is the opposite of that, it has cloudy skies, strange acting animals running around, and dark dull colors all throughout it. The animation in this film is what brings it to life. All the characters are animated except Alice, Red Queen, White Queen, Mad Hatter, and the people at the engagement party. <br/><br/>While walking through wonderland Alice runs into the White Rabbit, the Dormouse, Tweedledum, Tweedledee, and the Dodo. The group take Alice to Absolem the caterpillar, where they check a calendar detailing the everyday in wonderland known as the Oraculum. Eventually on Frabjous day, Alice has to slay the Jabberwocky, but Alice not wanting to slay the dragon attempts to convince them she's not the one. Absolem comments that Alice is ""Not hardly Alice."" Before they can return Alice to her home, the group is ambushed by the Bandersnatch and cards. The White Rabbit and Uilleam the Dodo get captured along with several flamingos. Alice, who's pursued by the Bandersnatch, stands her ground. Mallymkun, the Dormouse, saves Alice by stabbing out the Bandersnatch's eye, but it manages to scar Alice's arm. Alice and the Tweedles carry on until the 'Jubjub Bird' captures the Tweedles. <br/><br/>Later in the movie Frabjous day has finally arrived with both Red and White armies prepared for the epic battle. Alice put on the armor and Vorpal sword. Both armies arrive at a chessboard like battlefield for the battle between Alice and the Jabberwock. The Jabberwock reveals itself to Alice. Alice strikes first slicing off the Jabberwock's tongue. Alice climbs some ruins of a castle and continues to fight the Jabberwock. Mallymkun and Bayard are assaulted by the Jubjub bird but it gets crushed by a catapulted boulder accidentally fired by one of the Red Queen's soldiers. Alice manages to get on the back of the Jabberwock, where she is launched into the air, and then cuts off the Jabberwock's head. Everyone witnesses the defeat of the Jabberwock. The Red Queen orders her troops to kill Alice but they no longer follow her since the death of both the Jabberwock and Jubjub bird. Chessur crowns the White Queen as once again the queen of wonderland. The White Queen banishes her sister to the out lands along with the Knave. The Knave, unable to live with the Red Queen, attempts to kill her but is quickly stopped by Tarrant. As the Red Queen and The Knave are carried off, Tarrant does the Futterwacken dance. The White Queen collects the blood of the Jabberwock which will send Alice back to the human world. Giving her final farewell and reminding them she will return, Alice drinks the blood. Alice finds herself grasping the edge of the rabbit hole. She climbs up and out of the hole and returns to the party. Alice declines Hamish's proposal, yells at everyone who wanted her to marry him, and chooses to become his father's trainee. Alice begins her voyage to China, saying goodbye to her family. A blue butterfly lands on Alice's shoulder. Alice smiles and replies, ""Hello, Absolem."" Absolem then flies off, and the movie ends.<br/><br/>Angie Errigo says ""Strictly speaking it should be entitled something like Alice in Underland or Alice: The Return. So, be warned, there is no recitation of The Walrus and the Carpenter, no Mock Turtle or Humpty Dumpty (although arguably it's worth the trip just to hear Depp recite from Jabberwocky)"". This is agree with because Alice has been to Wonderland before and it returning. The film is newer but it's a huge hit considering it's a remake of the classic one. The film was a huge hit in the theater and worldwide in DVD. Children might adore the classic version more because it all animated and less scary. The film should be for young adults not necessarily children because they wouldn't understand what's going on. The film is scary because all the oddly shaped people and their odd looking appearances. Viewers will be more than mesmerized by the animation in this film, the plot is easily defined. This film teaches children to believe in their dreams and that things can come true."

","The original Alice's Adventures in Wonderland book was just a story about a little girl who gets bored of her school lessons and has a dream about a magical world. Today, when people think of Alice and Wonderland, they think of mental hospitals, imaginary friends, schizophrenia, electrode-convulsive therapy, lobotomies and other extremely morbid topics. How did an innocent little kid's book become a topic with these creepy adult themes!? Was it that messed up video game made by American McGee about an insane Alice? Was it Resident Evil, where a character named Alice goes through a deadly laboratory? Was it that 1973 movie Go Ask Alice about the teenage girl on drugs? Was it that horribly inaccurate movie about the girl with Taurette's Syndrome, Pheobe in Wonderland? Since god-knows-when, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has been made out by emo, melodramatic people to be something dark, creepy and disturbing, something it was never intended to be. Lewis Carroll must have been rolling in his grave when this demented Tim Burton Disney version came out.<br/><br/>What's sad is that before Burton was bought by Disney, he put out some spectacular movies (Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Vincent, etc.) and now his work is all controlled by Disney. In this version of the movie, the story of Alice has been twisted around by Tim Burton so that it plays out more like a bad fanfiction between Alice and the Mad Hatter. As usual Tim Burton never hires anyone else more original for his movies, he's always gotta stick Johnny Depp and Helena-Bonham Carter in there as the lead roles, though to be fair, Alice was played by someone other than Winona Ryder or Christina Ricci (two actresses he uses way too much). Alice is nineteen in this version; it takes place after her original adventures as a young child and she's set up to hopefully marry an ugly guy named Hamish (seriously, they couldn't come up with something a little less obvious, he's a fat guy and they name him Hamish, definitely not original)! The voice talents of Stephen Fry and Alan Rickman (Snape from Harry Potter) and the excellent acting job of Anne Hathaway (the lead character in the 2008 movie Passengers) were the only good things about this movie! The soundtrack was awful, the scenes such as the Mad Hatter doing a strange breakdance thing were just stupid and made no sense, Johhny Depp looked like Pennywise the clown from IT (1990) if he'd gone through the washing machine, it was morbid and scared my little brother half to death, it's all Disney-fied garbage and I hated it!"

","Hollywood loves to create remakes of classic films from years ago. They hired Tim Burton to do ""Alice in Wonderland"", a remake from the animated classic of 1951. This time he makes it live action and stylish by adding some darkness and absolutely artistic production design and other visual elements. The story is the same. A young woman named Alice (Mia Wasinkowska) denies dancing with a noble Englishman at a party, so runs off to find herself trapped in a magical world after falling down a large hole by a tree. In this Wonderland she meets many mysterious creatures such as the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), Alice guide through Wonderland, two odd twins named Tweedledee and Tweedledum, an evil and a good queen, a smoking caterpillar, an energetic rabbit and a unique Cheshire cat. here Alice learns her true destiny is to free Wonderland from the evil Red Queen (Helan Bonham Carter) and become a hero. This plot is lead with an all-star cast and a creative director which gives this film suave. It could have been very easy to make this film one giant mess, but thankfully Tim Burton was hired to save this remake and turn it into visual art. The character development is a little weak, but that doesn't matter due to the plot being kinetic and always full of matter and tension. There is always something going on. The visual effects are very cutting-edge. They may not be as realistic looking as ""The Lord of the Rings' or as explosive as other films, but there not suppose to. They look magical and new. The action scenes, the mist, the movements all look so new and extraordinary that it's impossible to take your eye off them. What's even more hard to take your eyes off is the production design. Wonderland is brought to life from Robert Stromberg in an unimaginable way. The sets, vegetation, costumes and makeup all fit the environment beautifully. The casting is perfect as well. Every actor plays each character perfectly and makes each once animated voice over come to life with so much depth and detail. ""Alice in Wonderland"" may not be an overall amazing film as it fails in some writing and editing, but it's visually miraculous and just plane old fun at the cinema."

","Alice in Wonderland (2010) is naturally not everybody's taste. It has little to do with the books of Carrol, and maybe it's not even an appropriate sequel. But it's totally one thing: wonderful!<br/><br/>It doesn't need to be an exact replica of the books.There are still enough elements left to be based on them, but with new, fresh ideas. Wonderland is pure, crazy and twisted fantasy where everything seems possible and Burton introduce the viewer to his very own Wonderland (which I personally prefer over the original). And like the Mad Hatter it can be on one hand very beautiful, colourful, joyful and on the other hand, it shows its shadowy sides, where everything is dark and in tones of grey, or even dangerous. So it is very interesting to see every emotion displayed not only on the Hatters face but also expressed by the colors of his eyes, his clothes and even the tone and accent of his voice! He literally wears his heart on his sleeve and teaches Alice to find her own muchness again. Because her character needs to grow, not only to face the Jabberwocky but also to take her life in her own hands. Alice grows up during her stay and it's nice to see her changing.<br/><br/>But not only these two characters show a wide range of feelings. Even under the nice and peaceful face of the White Queen lures something dark and you can also find something vulnerable under the layers of hatred when take a closer look at her sister the Red Queen. Of course they seem completely good or bad at first sight, but there are enough hints that especially in Wonderland not everything is really like it seems. <br/><br/>The story itself is a bit weak in my eyes, but in contrast to that, they did a marvelous job in creating the atmosphere of wonderland. Be it the background, the completely animated characters, like Chesire Cat or the Caterpillar (which still had some facial features of his voice actor Alan Rickman), the partially animated characters like the Tweedles, or the characters with minor changes of the real actor/actress. The transition is floating, not only thanked to the CGI-artists but also because of the outstanding costumes and the rest of the set which wasn't green screen. Plus that some characters get some background story, which isn't very detailed but lefts space for own imagination.<br/><br/>Like Carrols books, Burton knows how to inspire the fantasy of others with this Alice adaption."

Alice is by far the one who stood out the most (as she is the main character), dare I say she's a good role model for children.<br/><br/>The 2010 movie adaptation of the novel summarizes the 2 novels pretty well. They introduced again old English literature to the modern world. I just love this hybrid between old classic's story and modern films. It reminds me of the childhood stories I had read, and at the same time, still surprises me with new plot twists, conflicts, and of course, the graphics and the seemed- so-real animations, which really showed the evolution of movie animations compared to the last Disney's Alice in Wonderland in 1951.<br/><br/>If you don't like/not familiar with the story of Alice from the start of the film however, I suggest you go and watch the 1951's version or read the book first. You might find the story a little bit cliché, but hey, it's based on children's literature."

","In the film, after being proposed to by a man whose lifestyle bores her, Alice bolts from the alter to follow a curious rabbit on a magical adventure. After falling down a rabbit hole, she meets a variety of characters in a new world. She has to question her identity after finding out she was predetermined to slay a monster and free her new friends from the evil Red Queen's reign. The story of Alice In Wonderland epitomizes the question of what is real and what is not. Similar to the film The Matrix, young Alice is presented with the opportunity to escape the mundaneness of her everyday life and enter into a new world. Initially, Alice finds herself having to decide to either stay alone in an empty room, or to ingest an unknown substance to gain access into the world beyond. Alice decides to be brave and live up to her destiny. This is not unlike the situation Neo found himself in as depicted in The Matrix. Here, the liquid with the ""drink me"" tag parallels the red pill. Despite the fact that the events were all made up in Alice's head, she lived up to her destiny and her true identity after entering her own wonder-filled matrix."

","I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was very interesting how they approach this new Alice, a groaned one. But still, I think the movie is more interesting at level of visual effects, they were stunning. On top of that we have the costumes, we can see that there was thought on it. I liked to watch how Johnny Deep captured very well the Mad Hatter, but I think it was just that. Alice, for me, its also a boring character, even though I liked the actress looks and interpretation, the only thing interesting about the story of Alice its Wonderland. I have to say that this is a watchable movie, fun but a bit mysterious to look at."

","Nineteen year old Alice Kingsleigh has been having the same dream since she was a child; a strange dream featuring a mad hatter, a variety of talking animals and a cat that smiles. On the day of her engagement party she sees a white rabbit wearing a waistcoat and follows it; she falls down the rabbit hole and finds herself in Underland... the place of her dreams. As she meets familiar characters she assumes she is dreaming; perhaps she is but she can't wake herself up and the dangers there do seem real. She learns that they expect her to fulfil a prophecy; to do that she will have to get the Vorpal sword from the palace of the evil Red Queen and slay the fearsome Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>I haven't seen previous adaptations of the 'Alice in Wonderland' story but know enough to realise it was originally about a little girl. Tim Burton's idea of making this as a Return to Wonderland didn't bother me and I thought Mia Wasikowska did a decent job in the role. The rest of the cast; both those physically acting and those providing the voices for various CGI creatures was pretty good although at times Johnny Depps performance as the Hatter seemed like a series of disjointed performances; this may have been designed to emphasise the characters 'madness' but I'm not sure that it worked. The story itself was a fairly run of the mill quest but it featured some amusing characters and a succession of entertaining set pieces. The story is obviously aimed at viewers much younger than me but some scenes may be a little shocking for younger children; I was more than a little surprised to see a creature have one of its eyes removed by one of the goodies in a Disney film! Overall I'd say this film has plenty of flaws and is far from a classic but it is still worth watching on television."

It looks like he should stick to making trailers, the images are interesting for about 5 minutes but when it comes to telling a story Mr Burton goes AWOL.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp also seems to have lost it. All his latest roles seem to be some twee parody of an incomprehensible Wizard of Oz character. Is it in his contract to mumble his words? <br/><br/>A lot has been written about how the plot has ended up being another quest with a final battle between good and evil.

"red_apals","1","0","2","14 December 2012"," Of when Tim Burton betrayed himself for a pretty face (Not his wife's)
","While the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp combo often dazzle us with their rather enjoyable inputs, Burton's obsession with the actor has sometimes too gotten the better of him. This is perhaps the most blatant example of this. The fact that Burton chose a very poor lead who, as Alice, seems to take the destiny of Wonderland as seriously as having her morning cereal; and changed the focus of the movie from adaptation to all out sequel is no coincidence, it is all perfectly calculated to make the Mad Hatter, portrayed by Depp, the main star of the show. Alice's bland personality, forgivable looks and silent ways (Which by the way are the complete opposite of any other Alice we've ever seen or heard of) are carefully crafted to not steal any spotlight from Hatta's crazy antics and colorful appearance. While I don't mind artistic license, Burton needs to remember that storytelling is not to be taken as something personal, but as a tool. The main flaw of a writer or a movie maker is getting in too deep with the characters, it disallows one from experimenting and takes away the pull of making them suffer, transforming characters into the Mary Sue Depp often is in Burton's work. It's sad to see this movie be such a failure because I used to think that if someone could convey the wonderful mess that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and it's lesser widespread sibling Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There are, was Burton. Disgracefully, his storytelling has fallen flat and the creatively sinister aura that surrounds works like Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas has faded away in spite for out of place ""Fabujous"" dances."
"jarobledo3","8","0","1","21 August 2012"," ""We're All Mad Here"" - The Cheshire Cat
","Say what you will about this Tim Burton film, but I like it! Of course, it does have its flaws: first of all, the plot seems rather rushed, and the action/suspense sequences seem crammed in together. Like the 1999 Hallmark film, this film suffers from too MANY special things, to the point where the ""heart"" of the story gets lost in the madness. The second main problem, and possibly a result of the first, is that many great actors and Wonderland characters do not get their ""due,"" so to speak. Michael Gough is a good example: his Dodo (named Uileam, though, for some reason, this is not given in the movie itself) has a grand total of three lines. One of these is whispered, so that we barely catch it, and the other is spoken offscreen. We see him last at the Queen's Croquet Game, as a caddy, and then he just...disappears. We never see or hear from him again. Was he rescued? Executed? Is he standing around, going ""Hello? I say, where is everybody?"" at the end of the movie? This being said, he's probably lucky he appeared at all; a good number of ""Alice"" characters do not make it here: from the first book alone, we have the Mouse with the Long, Sad Tail, the Lory, the Eaglet, the Owl, the Duck, Bill the Lizard, Pat, the Duchess, the Cook, the Pig-Baby, the Gryphon, the Mock Turtle, and the Giant Puppy, and from the second, the missing persons include the White King, the White Knight, the Walrus, the Carpenter, the Sheep, the Lion, the Unicorn, Humpty Dumpty, the Goat, the Horse, the Man in the Paper Suit, and the Gnat.<br/><br/>This being said, the characters that do appear, are, in my mind, pretty well done: Tim Burton takes the old adage of ""nothing is what it seems"" very much to heart in this take on Carroll's masterpiece and its equally famous sequel. The Queen of Hearts/Red Queen and the White Queen are a prime example: the Red Queen is our villain, who is uncertain if what she is doing is really right, and, in all honesty, just wants people to love her. She wants friendship, she wants attention, and she feels she deserves it. But, as if her temper wasn't a big enough problem, she has a tumor that causes her head to swell up to three times its normal size, so that alone will make people disgusted. As for her sister, she is our ""good queen,"" but is not entirely kind and lovely herself: behind her flighty, smiling demeanor, she hides a vicious side, and the capacity to be just as cruel, if not even crueler, than her loathed sister.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter (a.k.a. Tarrant Hightopp) is the source of much debate about this movie. I think he does a pretty good job. His Hatter takes the mercurial history of this character a step or two further: rather than simple mood swings, this character has a split-personality disorder, signaled by his eyes and accent changing colors, from neon green irises and a sweet, puppy-like, faintly Ed Wynn-esque voice and persona, to an orange-red eyed, Scottish-accented berserker. Mia Wasikowska, our Alice and the other top-billing star of this film, is beautiful in her part, and she's the only Alice I can see fighting something as dark and monstrous as the Jabberwocky and not lose any affection for. Her search to find her ""muchness"" is compelling, despite how rushed the film makes her journey, and she's just excellent overall.<br/><br/>Stephen Fry's portrayal of Chessur (the Cheshire Cat) is marvelous, and Paul Whitehouse as Thackery Earwicket, the March Hare, is hilarious (even if his character does get the short end of the wishbone). Crispin Glover is deliciously slimy as the Knave of Hearts, Illosovic Stayne, and Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter play the two Queens to the hilt. Michael Sheen's White Rabbit, Nivens McTwisp, is so much like the original character it's almost frightening, Absolem the Caterpillar is brilliantly voiced by Alan Rickman, and Matt Lucas delights as the voice (and...er...face) of both of the Tweedledee and Tweedledum.<br/><br/>The real show-stealer for me is the Mallymkun, the Dormouse, played by Barbara Windsor. Feisty, loyal, skeptical...and, despite, or perhaps because of, her small size, a darn good swordswoman...er, swords-rodent. This is my favorite incarnation of the Dormouse, a testament to the phrase ""dynamite comes in small packages...and sleeps in teapots."" All this I've mentioned is heightened by the fantastic art direction, which brings a decadence to Wonderland befitting the supposed decay the Red Queen has brought upon it, yet still fits in this world, giving it a timeless look, as if it has been there all my life. All this is done brilliantly...and rarely looks like the work of the great John Tenniel, but, then, that was to be expected from the beginning, when this movie was first spoken of in mere, whispered rumors.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, here are the up-sides: great art, great characters, a great story, and, very often, a great cast. The down-sides: the story, while good, is rushed, and the effects get in the way of the emotions, giving this film too much madness and not enough magic. Still, I love it. I am through with this rant of a review. Thank you."
"Leofwine_draca","4","0","1","4 August 2012"," Imaginative visual imagery, little story to go with it
","Tim Burton is one of those directors who can achieve greatness or blandness, and you're never quite sure which of those his next film will encompass. SWEENEY TODD, his recent adaptation of the musical, was tremendous, quickly becoming my favourite Burton film. ALICE IN WONDERLAND, his follow-up to SWEENEY, is undoubtedly one of his worst and could readily make up a double bill with the similarly underwhelming CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.<br/><br/>The problem with ALICE IN WONDERLAND is that it's all about endless computer graphics with no real meat or substance to the script. There's no sense of gravitas to the story, no real characterisation, just repetitive scenes of Alice wandering a fantastic world and interacting with a series of animated characters played by typically British thespians.<br/><br/>The cast itself is astonishing: Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Matt Lucas, Michael Sheen, Stephen Fry, Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, Alan Rickman, Barbara Windsor, Timothy Spall...the list goes on and on. But 95% of those actors are wasted and deliver nothing that unknowns couldn't. Johnny Depp, who gives an energetic performance as the Mad Hatter, fares a lot better, but Bonham Carter's villain is shrill and irritating and as the lead, Mia Wasikowska is fairly bland and unappealing.<br/><br/>I admit that I found the CGI quite average; the worldscapes look good, full of colour and imagination, but the creations themselves just look like cartoons (take Tweedledum and Tweedledee as a case in point). The CGI works a lot better when it augments an existing performance, as in the case of Helena Bonham Carter's character. Some scenes, like those involving a CGI dog, should have just been shot live-action and it does feel like laziness sets in on occasion. You get the impression that Burton was so fixated on the visuals that he forgot to make a film of any real substance to go with them."

","I personally don't remember a single scene from the original Alice in Wonderland, but I know what the original story is about. Thought that one could have an educative story, I don't think this version has. Tim Burton gives a masterly direction, making the spectator feel impressed with such beautiful scenario. All pictures and colors are fantastic, you feel like someone put some hallucinogenic drugs in your drink. However, the story never engages; the plot is totally senseless and you don't know why animals and people are saying such weirdo stuff. The movie spends 80% of its time wondering if it's the real Alice-- even Alice herself becomes bored with such repetitive question. Characters have no development and you just can't get to know any of them, since characters Alice is talking to alternate every time. It's a boring movie trying to be cult, but in the end it's just a beautiful photography with no tenor."

","Talking about flaws, the first thing that comes to mind is absence of unexpectedness; maybe, the reason lies in the fact that the story is well-known for everybody, but you definitely expect more from the film. I had great expectations from this film as 'Edward Scissorhands' had been one of my favorites; another film from the same writer but 'Alice In Wonderland'is so plain and tranquil in comparison with the previous mentioned film. That was the other side of the coin, but let's turn our minds to the pluses. In the first place, there are visuals, which are rather stunning, but not the same as in 'Avatar'(2009), that cannot be effortlessly beaten."

","Great production design, a mildly amusing Johnny Depp and the most mainstream storyline that I have ever seen in a Tim Burton film to date. As you can tell, I am totally divided as whether I thought this was a good or a bad day at the movies.<br/><br/>The good news is that I thought that Johnny Depp did nicely. Not entirely up to par with previous characters, but at least he wasn't as creepy as the Mad Hatter, as he was as Willy Wonka. The bad news is that the story and most of the characters just doesn't have that kind of odd whimsy, usually found in Tim Burton's work. Everything is kind of watered down so as to not totally freak out mainstream audiences, particularly the kiddies. Also, there is kind of a moral to this film that I would have never expected coming from Burton.<br/><br/>As for the animated characters, they were just not that much fun. I got a few chuckles out of the rabbit and the Cheshire cat but otherwise they are pretty much what you would expect from an ordinary animated film.<br/><br/>Still, the film moves at a brisk pace and I can't say that I was totally bored, I just expected more. By the way, after Helena Bonham-Carter's fifth ""Off with their heads!"", could you tell that it was supposed to be funny by then?"
"robotbling","5","0","1","12 December 2011"," Not enough of Tim Burton's style seeped into this one
","(www.plasticpals.com) Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland isn't either of those things. The story isn't that of Lewis Carroll, but a kind of pseudo sequel that takes place years later. Alice is twenty years old and is facing an uncertain future, most pressing of which is an unwanted marriage proposal. Running from her troubles, she tumbles down the rabbit hole once again and encounters some of the same situations and most of the characters from the original story, but is tasked with slaying a dragon called the Jabberwocky. It feels like the story is being tugged in two directions; at once trying to remain faithful to the book while not repeating the story we're all familiar with.<br/><br/>As a fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, and Sleepy Hollow, I was looking forward to seeing the world of Alice in Wonderland through Burton's distorted lens. The possibilities seem endless. What ended up on screen is surprisingly generic and could almost be attributed to any director. Tim Burton's style can be picked out in precious few details (most obviously the Red Queen's card-like knights). Which is not to say the creature and world designs are bad – the Cheshire Cat looks fantastic – they just don't have Burton's stamp on them, which would have been so much more interesting to see.<br/><br/>Unlike Avatar, which largely avoided mixing human actors with their CG counterparts, Alice is constantly surrounded by them. Perhaps because of this, or the inherent nature of the creatures themselves, they stand out as wholly unrealistic cartoons, even when they're meant to be scary. Stars like Johnny Depp (the Mad Hatter) don't escape computer alteration, which works wonderfully in the case of Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and Helena Bonham Carter's Queen, but not much at all for Crispin Glover's Knave of Hearts. What does work extremely well are the virtual sets, which marry to the live actors successfully and are brimming with incredible details, and as Alice shrinks and grows she meshes seamlessly. The film is being shown in 3D, and I would suggest you see it in 3D if you plan to go because it does add to the experience.<br/><br/>In the end its universal recognition may be its biggest downfall; having been adapted dozens of times before, it may simply be impossible to recapture the wonder that the story and characters once held. Had Burton radically redesigned the creatures and settings, like an illustrator giving the story his own treatment, it would have had a much better chance at it. While not a bad movie by any means, it's not the re-imagining one would expect given the director's reputation. Instead, it's a by the numbers affair that seems to fall squarely in line with that other Disney fantasy spectacular Chronicles of Narnia."
"Boba_Fett1138","5","0","2","20 November 2011"," The movie totally forgets to be entertaining.
","This is Tim Burton's most successful movie, financially. However I will go as far to say that this is probably one of his worst movies and actually I always have been quite a big fan of Burton and his unique and unusual visions, ideas and style of film-making.<br/><br/>This is not your average or traditional Alice in Wonderland movie. First of it it's featuring an adult Alice and the story doesn't really seem to be following any of the Lewis Carroll books. It's more like a mixture of different Alice stories thrown together, with Burton's special touch and vision blend in as well. It actually sounds like a great combination; Tim Burton and Alice in Wonderland but the end result is disappointing, in about every way thinkable.<br/><br/>First of all the visuals; Now, I have always been a big fan of the look of Tim Burton movies but however the thing that seems to be the case with his most recent movies is that he's using way too many special effects to enhance the movie its visual look and go even more over-the-top with all of it. Well, enhance is not really the word I would use to describe it though. It's way too artificial looking for my taste. Not only just the world and its backgrounds but also all of its CGI characters and CGI altered ones. Now granted the effects for the Red Queen were pretty awesome and fun but that brings me to the perhaps true problem of its special effects; they are all very uneven. For every good and awesome looking scene there is something very bad and disappointing looking as well. I especially wasn't too fond or impressed with any of the movie its exterior shots, that all too obviously got shot indoors, in front of a green screen.<br/><br/>Also the story really wasn't anything impressive. Stuff just seemed to happen very randomly in the movie and characters literally pop up out of nowhere, who in the end hardly serve any purpose for the story at all. They only show up because they are familiar characters that everybody knows from the Lewis Carroll books but really, no one ever does anything that interesting in this movie. I don't even know why Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter was in this.<br/><br/>There just is no real point to the story. What exactly was the 'conflict'? It's not like there was a big mystery that needed to get resolved, or Alice was desperate to find a way back home, or a kingdom that needed to be saved from an evil queen. They wanted to still go for this approach perhaps but they simply failed at making the Red Queen come across like a tyrant, that was a danger and big threat to its fantasy world and all those living in it.<br/><br/>The story is basically a huge waste of a potentially fine and fun movie and also definitely a waste of such a fine cast. The movie is really filled with some great and well known actors but most of them hardly get to do anything in this movie at all. Perhaps the only persons who still manage to do something good or fun with their roles are Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter. No, not even Johnny Depp really manages to do anything good or fun with his character.<br/><br/>But this all really wasn't the biggest problem I had with this movie. Thing that was mostly disappointing was how it seemed to totally forgot to be an entertaining movie. I was amazed at how dialog filled the movie was and 45 minutes in I realized that nothing had even really happened in the movie. Yes, I was more bored than entertained by this movie. I just can't forgive the movie for that. How can you make an Alice in Wonderland movie and not make it a fun or entertaining one to watch?<br/><br/>A boring, over-stylized, modern fairytale, that totally forgets how to be fun or entertaining.<br/><br/>5/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

When I did I left the theater upset.<br/><br/>The actress playing Alice was downright terrible. So stiff and stale. The characters like the Red Queen, The Hare, The Chesher Cat, and the other mad Hare (that drinks tea with the Mad Hatter) all lack the fun and personality the Walt Disney characters had (which is very important because this film is like a part 2 to it). Not only that, the rest of the plot and characters (except the Mad Hatter who was somewhat okay) are boring and flat. The movie is slow paced and incredibly predictable. This film is a downfall and disappointment as a movie, and a ""part 2"" to Walt Disney's Alice In Wonderland. Watch that movie.

"Lejink","5","0","3","30 September 2011"," Alice in chains
","Maybe I'm getting all CGI'd out but all these phantasmagorical movies of recent years seem to me to be blending into one big amorphous morass. Watching this Tim Burton update of the classic ""Alice In Wonderland"" tale (why keep the same title for a different story?), I felt there was little I hadn't seen before in a Harry Potter, Lord Of The Rings or Narnia derivation, never mind the ghosts of Burton's own past including ""Beetlejuice"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"". <br/><br/>So we get a late teenage Alice with issues, a much darker and good-and-evil polarised Wonderland (or Underland, if you will), and a much bigger part, not unnaturally, for big star Depp. Unfortunately this latter condescension to the box-office skewers the film too much away from Alice as the title and therefore central character. Burton also can't resist a bloody big battle as the conclusion as Alice confronts the dread Jabberwocky. Plus a typically bombastic soundtrack from Danny Elfman which hardly helps with the enchantment. <br/><br/>Yes, it is a grand spectacle and must have looked great in 3D for those with extra cash to spend but Burton makes the mistake of treating the audience like adults when we should be made to look more for our inner-child again. As for the performances, Mia makes for a fairly unconvincing Alice and seems too old for part. Depp plays his wide-eyed eccentric outsider the way he always does, only this time, for some reason he trots out his dreadful Scottish accent (a la Mike Myers) he last utilised in ""Finding Neverland"". Better is Mrs Burton herself, Helena Bonham-Carter as the wicked red queen (for some reason she's not called the Queen Of Hearts despite being surrounded by hundreds of them at her court) and her enormous head while there's lots of British support in real-life roles as well as in speaking roles for the talking animated characters. I also think the film could have inserted a bit more humour, especially in the second half, to leaven the heaviness. <br/><br/>Certainly it's easy on the eyes, with some good stunts and yes, special effects dropped in at regular intervals, but in the end it employed too many genre clichés for my liking and thus let down"
"OneRingToRuleThemAll13","Null","0","2","26 July 2011"," Beautiful and thoroughly inventive, enjoyable and successfully nonsensical version of Alice in Wonderland!!
","This movie in my opinion is thoroughly enjoyable. It has beautiful vistas (especially on Blu-ray), interesting characters, epic action sequences (like the fight with the Jabberwocky :D) and funny situations.<br/><br/>Let's just start by saying I DID see the film in 3-D, but due to the overwhelming attendance in the theater, my brothers and a friend of ours (and of course, yours truly), had to sit in a row of chairs exceedingly close and low to the TV screen, disabling the 3-D effect considerably, so I don't know the quality of the 3D.<br/><br/>Anyway, as I have mentioned before this is a film with amazing special effects, making Wonderland a truly magical and beautiful place to wonder around. The CGI-generated characters that inhabit it are also well-realized, and the make-up on the Mad Hatter is particularly astounding.<br/><br/>Now for the acting: Mia Wasikowska is not that believable as Alice, and her lines and charm fall flat and she looks like she doesn't really want to be in the film at all. However, Johnny Depp is truly excellent as the Mad Hatter!! He really looks like he's mad! His jokes, lines and facial gestures are incredibly well executed. Bravo, Johnny!! Anne Hathaway is somehow odd as Mirana. She does her acting well and she delivers a good performance. However (for some reason which I will never understand), she keeps her arms up in a clumsily graceful posture throughout the entire moviee!!! Seriously, she hardly ever puts them down and, because of this her performance is laughable O_O The rest of the cast is good, especially Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. She delivers a successfully funny and intriguing performance and should garner recognition for this role.<br/><br/>The sound and music is cool. You'll hear the roar of the Jabberwocky and epic music in astounding perfection.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my review. I gave this film a 9 because of Anne's arm habit which annoyed me and stopped me from taking the film seriously. But it's still good for a laugh and I highly recommend this to anyone who likes nonsensical characters and plot lines.

Anne Hathaway is not up to the job as «White Queen» and his performance is not credible at all. I would never paint there lips in black, they seem a bit out of place, even for wonderland.

","So I watched 2010's Alice in Wonderland done by the genius Tim Burton. So is this movie a flash of genius well, no quite frankly. Is this movie visually stunning, yes, is the plot any good well no. If I had tackled this project I would have been faithful to Lewis Carrol's original masterpieces and maybe made two films. However, I am not, I am a guy who will probably die un-famous and unregarded as a visionary director. However, I am right in suggesting why screw with a classic story and combine the elements of both books with elements that are original. If you look at Jackson's Lord of the rings trilogy, he may have changed some things but left the series as a trilogy and stayed true for the most part and that is why it works. Even a movie like ""No country for Old men"" where the Coen brothers changed the basic premise of the original story to be about two men in a struggle, was still dedicated to the original story and dialog why because it is awesome, well the same is true for Lewis Carrol's endeavors written over 100 years ago. The story rocks and the dialog rocks so why mess with it, well the answer is don't, and that is why this movie kind of sucks. However, if you do lots of hallucinogenics check it out, once again it is visually satisfying. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"

","Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland is very appealing visually but this just can't make up for such a worn out bland story to go with it. Inst looks like he is trying hard at fantasy epoch with a cast of strange characters and the whole hodge-podge dosn't add up to a decent movie. I would have preferred to see a smaller but quirkier movie with this odd assortment of characters. Instead we get a Disneyesque story with rather flat characters. This could have been so much more. I thought the ending to be so hokey I laughed at it. I do like the idea of the major power players in wonderland are all women though.<br/><br/>grade: C-"

","This is one of the most disappointing movies I have seen in the last five years or so. Alice in Wonderland should has the premise that should have fit Tim Burton's creative mind perfectly. His collaborations with Johhny Depp have generated some of the most fascinating work in cinema history (Ed Wood; Edward Scissorhands especially) but, instead he failed to keep the record going. He should have taken over the screenplay from Linda Woolverton and created darker, more dimensional characters (regardless of it being a Disney movie); instead, what we get is Tim Burton for the family audience. I would have preferred his take on Lewis Carroll's novel rather than a rehash of every Hollywood child fantasy film. I thought the younger Alice in the film looked the part of the original illustrations and would have been perfect for the role. Johnny Depp had a perfect opportunity with the Mad Hatter and ruined it with his accent and incoherent speech. Tim Burton destroyed the Mad Hatter with his ugly costume design. I was disappointed to not hear Hatter shout ""Change places!"" I understand he is saddened by resent events, but even a mumbled, sad, ""Change places"" would have been nice to hear and keep his character intact through a simple and effective effort. Yes, the cgi is well done, but that is to be expected with a $200 million budget and the imagery is shallow (no audience that has any depth will fall for the distracting trippy color scheme that Burton relies on all to heavily as the backdrop of the movie (as if the cgi has become the star of the storytelling process)."

","I'll admit something before I start. I never enjoyed Lewis Caroll's classic. As a child I'd read different versions of Alice in Wonderland but they always left me somewhat unimpressed. Maybe it reflected the innocence in the young minds of 1865. Maybe Cartoon Network & the IT boom made us more matured than we ought to have been in our childhood. In any case, when I saw the trailer of Alice's escapades being re-recited by the Tim Burton-Johnny Depp 7th combo, it got just curiouser for me.<br/><br/>I was actually impressed by the way the movie started & unwounded. Writer Linda Woolverton (one of the writers of the classic Lion King) chose to start with an older Alice (a smiling Mia Wasikowska) who gets to revisit Wonderland, which she visited as a child. ""Return to Wonderland"" - or something similar, would have sounded more apt a title. Thereon, Burton plans a setup at the end of which we see Alice running away into the woods and following the same talking rabbit down the (probably same) hole into Wonderland where the 3-D effects play their real role.<br/><br/>I watched this film for Johnny Depp. I waited for the Tea Party episode which is probably the only scene I loved & enjoyed in this story. In the interim, Alice meets the usual medley of characters who were mostly ""transmogrified"" Actors, welcoming her back to Wonderland. Animating the real actors' faces for some of the characters, worked very much in favour of creating the right atmosphere. The Red Queen (a hamming Helena Bonham Carter) with a blown up head & Matt Lucas in the twin Tweedle roles were noteworthy. That was it. It went all down-hill after that. Some interesting characters like the puffing caterpillar (Alan Rickman) and the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) light up a few moments. But the story swiftly gets into action mode, focusing on a tale of tiff between the sisters, the Red Queen & the White Queen (a lost Anne Hathway with white hair & black brows) and ending the Wonderland story with a silly action sequence which seemed totally seemed out of place.<br/><br/>Sadly, I wasn't impressed by the Tea Party episode & many other scenes. But Johnny Depp yet again remains one of the few things to watch out for. He's an actor with a gifted versatility which helps him slip effortlessly into any role. The Mad Hatter wouldn't have been half of what it was without Depp, never mind the screen space allotted to him. This, combined with the beautiful imagery with all its tiny detailing by Burton helped fill the void created by the amateurish screenplay which was void of the wit that made Depp-Burton's animated Corpse Bride (2005) & writer Woolverton's Lion King (1994), an enjoyable experience. Thankfully, the 3-D didn't mar the experience of the beautiful images to a noticeable extent and in some places even enhanced the experience. My personal 3-D favourites were the scenes when Alice falls down the hole & the one when the Cheshire Cat appears out of thin air in the forest.<br/><br/>An action sequence to end a kiddie-flick? Come On! I still cant digest it. Maybe Burton lost sight of the child-adult line he wanted to cross-over like Christopher Nolan did with Batman. A messy final product ! But the scenes after Wonderland which completed the 1 Billion $ grossing movie are a face-saving grace and diluted the bad taste that I feared I would have.<br/><br/>6 + 1 / 10<br/><br/>(tempted to keep it at 6 out of 10 but a plus one for Director Burton's visual perception, writer Woolverton's fast paced story & Depp's performance which made it slightly more than a direct-from-book adaptation)"

","Welcome to a creepy fantasy world, courtesy of director Tim Burton and his favorite actor Johnny Depp. While some might be growing tired of the Burton/Depp combo, I am not, the unquestionable talent Depp brings to every role is a big plus in this film. Depp makes even the most ridiculous character come alive and seem believable. The visuals in this film are nothing short of fantastic, even when they are not in 3D (Hollywood knock it off with the 3D crap, it's an annoying and expensive gimmick.) Much like The Wizard of Oz, the fantastic characters found in Wonderland are reflections of people Alice knows in the real world. The wicked Queen of Hearts, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dumb, The Knave of Hearts, The Cheshire Cat, The Catterpiller, The Mad Hatter, The Rabbit, and the cast of my favorite poem, The Jabberwocky, all are wonderfully done amid a sea of stunning visuals and a magical story."
"ajs-10","6","0","1","1 January 2011"," Good, but sadly unsatisfying...
","I have never seen the 1951 Disney animated feature which tells the story of Alice's first trip to Wonderland. You see, she has grown up now and this film tells the story of her second set of adventures in Wonderland. I'll give you a brief summary before I tell you my thoughts (summary haters please tell me why A Raven is like a Writing Desk It's been bothering me all day).<br/><br/>Alice is now nineteen and it has been arranged that she shall marry Hamish, the son of a Lord, but she is not really interested in marriage. It is decided that he will propose to her publicly at a party thrown by his family. The unpretentious Alice is distracted as the big moment arrives and finds herself compelled to follow a white rabbit just as he comes out with the words. As you might guess, the rabbit disappears down a hole and is soon followed by Alice. Having made herself the right size by drinking a potion, she enters Wonderland, a place that looks kind of familiar, but she can't place from where. Here she meets many characters, including the Mad Hatter, The Cheshire Cat and the Red Queen. At first there is some debate as to whether she is the right Alice, and she has reservations herself. You see, if she is the right Alice, then she must perform a very heroic task and she's not sure she's up to doing that. I really don't want to give it away, so I'll leave Alice down the rabbit hole for now.<br/><br/>This is unmistakably a Tim Burton film. All the quirks and outlandishness that mark his style of filmmaking in abundance. It is beautifully made with great attention to detail. I saw the 2D version which, I'm told by those who know about these things, is better than the 3D cut. Great performances all round, particularly from; Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter, Mia Wasikowska as Alice, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. I should also give honourable mentions to Crispin Glover as Stayne - Knave of Hearts, Matt Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and the voice talents of; Michael Sheen as the White Rabbit, Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Alan Rickman as the Blue Caterpillar, Barbara Windsor as the Dormouse, Paul Whitehouse as the March Hare and Timothy Spall as Bayard.<br/><br/>Although this film is beautifully made with some great performances, I found it ultimately unsatisfying. I think because I know the story quite well the awe and wonder of seeing it for the first time is lost and that detracts from the viewer's enjoyment. There are some great comic moments and some truly magical scenes, but as a whole it kind of lacked something for me. It's worth seeing, but I wouldn't rush to buy the DVD even so, recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 6.4/10"
"Lenighma","5","0","1","29 December 2010"," Where is ""Whimsical""?
","To say I had high expectations for this movie is such an exaggeration, it's pathetic. This is Tim Burton, one of the few semi-deviant/non-mainstream directors and one of my favorites of all time teamed up with Danny Elfman and Johnny Depp!! It should have been WHIMSICAL, TWISTED and DARK...but instead we get stereotypical good-vs-evil, child-destiny movie that tried so very hard to be more than what is it and too much ""Narnia"". That had to be said. Again.<br/><br/>Alice's character in this movie is what I disliked most. She is very bland and colorless with absolutely no imagination (or common sense, though that wouldn't have been a problem in the original ""Alice"") and through, oh, 90% of of the movie believes Underland is a dream. Very...VERY annoying.<br/><br/>Also, when I did some research and realized more than half of the movie is CGI, that became an instant turndown for me. I can't really understand why, but for sure it's disheartening. <br/><br/>I liked the fact that they gave the characters names, but not last names. It makes it more like Our World. There was also a lot of character-favoritism in this movie, which I understand, but also a severe LACK of characters! <br/><br/>This is what I always tell people about this movie: 50% of the population saw this and hated it for not being true to the original book. The other 50% saw this and loved it for one of two reasons: Johnny Depp was in it/it's a Tim Burton movie. I, honestly, am one of those who saw this and loved it solely for Johnny's character portrayal...that is, 90% of the time. The other 10% I found myself sighing in disappointment because it's just...severely lacking something. All of it.<br/><br/>I understand the 50% who wished this was more like the book, but I also understand most people LIKE to create a more ""realistic"" or semi-realistic Wonderland. In this movie's case, however..it makes too much sense. That cannot be.<br/><br/>Nothing in this movie was surprising (sans what I adored about Johnny's portrayal of a truly mad hatter) and...I was overall so disappointed after seeing it, I can only say it gave more inspiration for a truly twisted ""Alice"" of my own...and left me sad that once again, I failed to get my dark, twisted Wonderland that I've waited ten years for."

","Despite all of the negative reviews, this movie is actually a great take on the classic Lewis Carrol adventure. It may not be what people expected but that's their problem. If everyone did all of what was expected of them, the world wouldn't be a particularly interesting place to live in now would it? <br/><br/>Tim Burton's colorful take on the wonderland which is magnificent and fresh is complimented by a decent story and a great script which also holds some incredibly funny satire about aristocracy (often entailing orders of decapitation from The Red Queen). The story chooses to focus on Alice being on the verge of adulthood in which she has to learn to take responsibility for her life, something that is done with credible emotionality and skillful acting. <br/><br/>One of the most interesting things about this movie however, has to be the characters, such as The Mad Hatter which Johnny Depp plays excellently, Chesire Cat (Stephen Fry) The Red Queen, the rabbit and even the Catepillar (played by Alan Rickman), all of whom bring life to an already visually stunning world. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie will serve as a great adventure for all of those who will let themselves get sucked into its stunning world. And those who don't are surely missing out."

","Alice in wonderland, a supposed remake of the sweet Disney classic, yet it seemed much more like a sequel. Tim Burton made the sweet movie into a dark minded film. The movie as I said seems as a sequel since Alice returns to Winderland at the age of 19, and then she has to battle out the bad guys/monsters throughout. There is the new character of the White witch, but from previous knowledge the movie is a combination of ""Jawberjockky""(sorry if misspelled) and ""Throught the Looking Glass"". So the title is the wrong if this is the combination of those two poems/stories. The acting, well it was fine. Johnny Deep, Helena Boham Carter, and Mia Wasikowska played their character close to perfect. The effects were really great, specially the Chesire Cat. Now, talking about the Chesire, I have to say that it looked awesome in blue as a change from pink. He looks more masculine, and more darker. Unfortunately every positive has a negative and that is the script. It was a little to boring and it just seemed as if it was a bad episode of a TV show. The effects were really well played, and even thought the movie was post converted to 3D, the 3D effects were great. In conclusion, the movie was good, not great, but the script was not that good. I would say a rental is fine, but buying the movie is not necessary."

Johnny Depp is a favorite of mine, but I had no interest in the movie. To my surprise it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, and at times I enjoyed it. But aside from Edward Scissorhands, Tim Burton often makes his movies much too dark for my liking. Alice in Wonderland is no different. It's very violent, and has some scenes that would definitely not be suited for kid watching. I enjoyed the performances very much though, and it's certainly better than the overrated animated original.<br/><br/>Performances. Johnny Depp is fantastic as The Mad Hatter. He's wonderfully kooky, and I loved every moment he was on screen. He continues to amaze me was his incredible versatility. Mia Wasikowska is impressive in her role. She's easy on the eyes, and portrays a very likable character. Helena Bonham Carter is great as The Red Queen. She's wickedly sinister in every sense of the word, and obviously had a blast playing the role. Anne Hathaway is absolutely gorgeous, and did very well in her role. The people who performed the voices all did great work.<br/><br/>Bottom line. A bit too dark to be fully successful, but it wasn't too shabby at all.

One of these arrangements happens to be party they are attending, which is actually meant to be Alice and Hamish's engagement party.<br/><br/>Once Alice herself is informed of this little change to the running schedule she bails to compose her thoughts, explaining to others that she has spotted a rabbit wearing a waistcoat.<br/><br/>Oh my! Anyway we know what happens next don't we? Alice falls into a deep hole. Upon finding a bottle marked ""Drink me"" she drinks, seeing something marked ""Eat me"", she eats Alas there is no ""Blow me"" sticker so we can't see just how Paris Hilton she really is.<br/><br/>Outside the small room everything is indeed ""Curioser and curioser"". Everything talks, and they live in an environment that must have been such a wet dream for Tim Burton to put together that I guarantee he is kicking himself for not thinking about making this film sooner.<br/><br/>There is much discussion among the ""various talking things"" if she is the ""Right Alice"", some think she is the others are unsure, so they take her to the caterpillar Absolon, voiced by Alan Rickman in a perfectly apathetic and uppity drawl. Absolon tells her she is actually the ""Wrong Alice"".<br/><br/>Now understandably Alice thinks this is all a dream and she keeps waiting to wake up, at times throwing caution to the breeze, you can't get hurt in a dream right? It turns out that her destiny is to kill the Jabberwocky, the pet (think Rancor) of the Red Queen, on Frabcious Day, which is rapidly approaching, which will restore the White Queen to her rightful place on the throne.<br/><br/>In this acid trip of a plot I will leave it there, Alice comes across a big grinned cat, a big headed Red Queen, another big mouthed White Queen (although I think Anne Hathaway's mouth is just big, not a special effect!) and Johnny Depp of course is the Mad Hatter, due to contractual arrangements that state he must be in every Tim Burton film.<br/><br/>I love Sleepy Hollow for some reason that I can't explain.<br/><br/>I like most of the other stuff Tim Burton does, and I like this. The visuals are of course sumptuous and vivid, the action suitably crazy and amusing and the plot actually meshes together reasonably well.<br/><br/>There is no one scene that stands out though as incredibly great, nor one performance or character that especially grabbed me, aside from Alan Rickman (who I think is a God thanks to Die Hard).<br/><br/>So I'll just say this: If you like Tim Burton you'll very much like this. I think for everyone else with an imagination or a willingness to embrace the abstract and different, this is worth seeing.<br/><br/>But I can't give a heartier recommendation than ""worth seeing"". At least it was better than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>One last thing, Computer Generated Imagery has meant that many films though impossible only a decade ago are now relatively simply to create. I only hope that it isn't making many directors lazy, though the evidence is pointing to the fact that the easy way out is now to ""tell a computer to do it"", rather than come up with an ingenious and clever way to do something.<br/><br/>Georges Lucas and Romero, I'm talking to you and I'm watching you Burton!

Mia Wasikowska was a decent Alice. Helena Bonham Carter played an excellent, yet strange Red Queen. Ann Hathaway was not a good White Queen, I will admit that. Crispin Glover was a very strange Stayne, but it was perfect for his personality. Matt Lucas had the perfect personality for Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Then Alan Rickman had the perfect voice for the Blue Caterpillar. A smaller part I enjoyed was by Paul Whitehouse who played the March Hare. His character was really funny. Now I wanted to mention my two favorite characters. Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat. The Hatter had a double personality. When he was calm and nice his voice was soft with a lisp. When he got angry it would be a strong Scottish accent. Depp had this perfect. The design and CG of the Cheshire was a joy and Fry had the voice perfect for it. So overall, the visual and the personality of the film was amazing to watch.

","When I initially heard that Tim Burton was going to adapt 'Alice in Wonderland', I was thrilled. Who better to cinematically adapt such a dark multilayered and somewhat ambiguous novel? However, after its release I've only heard negative comments and thus my expectations slightly lowered but how bad could it be? After all it's a frickin Tim Burton movie (I had stayed away from 'Planet of the Apes').<br/><br/>Finally I got the opportunity to see it and I couldn't believe my eyes, that this was created by the man who gave us 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Ed Wood', 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'Big Fish' (just to name a few examples of the great works he did). To me, 'Alice in Wonderland' was pretty much just another forgettable Harry Potter type movie but even those Potter films had heart. What happened to Tim Burton? <br/><br/>By no means is this a genuine adaptation. It doesn't stay true to its source at all. Needless to say, Burton has stripped the novel of all its layers, dumped the core, took the names and physical descriptions of the characters and a few scenes and gets Linda Woolverton to write a lame screenplay that barely resembles the book. The film was clearly made for children and so the darkness and ambiguity Carroll's work have been torn off the script. The best lines are those that were taken from the book. Most of the comedic scenes, even though they might draw some chuckles from the viewer, are completely out of place.<br/><br/>'Alice in Wonderland' looks appealing but the CGI is nothing extraordinary. While the animation is colourful and detailed, the stop motion movement is a constant reminder that this is just another CGI world. The cinematography, makeup and costumes are brilliant but certainly not enough to save this disaster. However, Anna Hathaway's makeup was quite inconsistent. In some scenes, her White Queen is pale and in others she's just Hathaway's normal skin colour. The score is quite bad.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter and Matt Lucas were quite good. Johnny Depp does the best with what he's given but unfortunately his Mad Hatter has been toned down a little too much and his character eventually comes across as dull while still begging for the viewer's sympathy. Anna Hathaway provides some comic relief (but then again, the comedy is too out of place). The worst performance comes from Mia Wasikowska. Now she is no bad actress (as is evident in 'In Treatment') but here her line delivery is terrible and her expressions are far from convincing. It's the kind of acting one would see in a children's film or think of a mother reading a book to her child, yes, that's how Wasikowska sounds.<br/><br/>Anyway, to summarize it in one sentence, this 'Alice in Wonderland' is like any other forgettable children's film. I doubt even children would enjoy it half as much as they would enjoy a Pixar movie. It lacks soul and sincerity. Burton better makeup for this."

","Writing my own version of the Alice books by Lewis Carroll for the stage, I can understand the difficulty in adapting this work for film. The books are very episodic with little to no story. On top of that, the dialogue in the books are so stylized that it's hard to really make an Alice movie without directly having to reference the original text. Also, people just hate to see their favorite books on screen. Ask any Twilight fan. Tim Burton presents a sequel, Alice in Wonderland, to the books Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass, so it's hard to compare the books to his film, and that's how it should be, enough said. Alice (newcomer Mia Wasikowska) is now an adult returning to Underland, a magical place she frequented as a child, but has only vague memories of it. Things are different now with The Red Queen (an amalgamation of The Queen of Hearts and The Red Queen from the books played by Helena Bonham Carter) taking over Underland. The all star cast includes Anne Hathaway (who turned down the role of Alice to play the kooky White Queen), Crispin Glover as The Knave of Hearts, Alan Rickman as The Caterpillar and Matt Lucas in the scene stealing roles of Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Of course there's also Johnny Depp as The Mad Hatter, but everyone knows he's in this one due to the massive publicity and marketing. With a script written by Linda Woolverton (Beauty and the Beast, Lestat and Lion King) and costumes by Colleen Atwood (Sweeney Todd, Memoirs of a Geisha, Nine, Edward Scissorhands) under Tim Burton's direction, can anything go wrong? Sadly, a few things can. I felt the characters were a little under developed, which makes me wonder if a plethora of character development scenes were cut. I also thought the storyline was too subtle. There is a story that happens in this movie, but it's so underplayed that you can almost forget it's there. I find this sad since Burton has stated that he wants his Alice film to have a story as opposed to being episodic. He almost succeeds. While there is a definite story, it seems to take a back seat to too much spectacle. On the good side, the script does an awesome job of mimicking Lewis Carroll's writing style. Other productions simply rehash the dialogue in the book, but in the case of this film, that was not an option due to it being a sequel. The dialogue is a huge highlight in this film. I also like that as a sequel, it really works. If you know these characters, then the lack of character development won't bother you. As a stand-alone movie, it's visually stunning, but that's about it. Despite my negative feelings about the film, I have no doubt of it's status as a classic. This movie will be seen over and over again from this day on, I promise you, and not just by me. Remember that Wizard of Oz in 1939 had a less than stellar opening and even the Burton produced Nightmare Before Christmas took awhile to really gain notoriety. Jam Tomorrow, Jam Yesterday, But Never Jam Today. As a sequel I think it's also makes an awesome companion piece to anyone's favorite version of Alice. So sit down, pop in your favorite Alice movie, then watch this Tim Burton sequel.<br/><br/>http://neonboy619.blogspot.com"

","A very important date? I wouldn't go that far. Quirky, surrealist director Tim Burton teams up once again with quirky, surrealist actor Johnny Depp as well as the vastly underrated Helena Bonham Carter to recreate Carroll's Wonderland for a new generation. I have always had a love-hate relationship with Burton, more so than any other director, and I found the end result particularly disappointing given this film's potential as a contemporary artistic pleasure.<br/><br/>Alice In Wonderland strays a fair way from the original in terms of plot, character motive and the amount of subliminal pro-drug messages. Or maybe that last one was just me. Alice is now approaching adulthood, and gets a nasty surprise upon showing up at a garden party, learning it is being held with the expectation that she accepts the marriage proposal of a less-than-adequate suitor. Of course, soon after this shocking revelation, she chases the White Rabbit down the hole and commences her adventure.<br/><br/>Let it be known that this is not the beloved Wonderland of your childhood. While it retains many physical elements featured in the original, it is noticeably darker. To be technical, it's been Burton-ised. This means that, just like Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice, a nice- enough looking setting foreshadows actions far more sinister under the surface. Positively, this overgrown, poorly maintained background certainly fits the tone of the film; one that seeks to forewarn the audience at all times and give the impression that Wonderland is in fact a dangerous, as opposed to playful, place.<br/><br/>Depth of acting is, for the most part, disappointing. Aussie Mia Wasikowska (repeat after me: Va-shi-kov-ska) struggles to bring realism to a forced Elizabethan accent throughout the film, but this can be largely attributed to her inexperience. <br/><br/>The same reasoning cannot be used for Johnny Depp. Arguably the greatest character actor of his generation, Depp fails to give the Mad Hatter any qualities intended to invoke emotion out of the viewer, which is a shame because he was given a much larger role than initially expected for that exact purpose; to extensively develop the characterisation of the most memorable, yet obscure, creation of Carroll's mind. Instead he lazily channels Jack Sparrow and, in one particularly cringe-worthy scene, Michael Jackson. It just seemed to me that he spent too much time trying to make the Hatter weird in the most literal sense of the word; time that perhaps would have been better spent collaborating over the character's motives and mannerisms. <br/><br/>Without doubt, the highlight of the film is Helena Bonham Carter's comedic portrayal of the Red Queen. Replacing the Queen of Hearts from the original, Carter plays the quintessential scene-stealing villain in an otherwise poor film. She is the only one who makes any effort to apply genuine emotion to her part, and our constant reminding of the fact that she enjoys disengaging people's heads from their bodies is just plain funny.<br/><br/>Overall, a lot of this film's problems stem from an innate inability to decide whether it wants to be a children's film (offering little more than a basic storyline with a flimsily constructed moral in the concluding scene) or an adult-appropriate take on a literary classic. While one may argue the film has a lot to say about embracing one's individuality, it is ultimately hollow and, more importantly, just not necessary in the applied context.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

","I was never a fan of the original animated version...in fact, I'm not sure if I ever saw it. Nor did I ever read the book, so I went into this movie not knowing the plot or origin or anything. I viewed it as if it were an original story. That being said, i found the movie gimmicky and overall poor in quality<br/><br/>the plot was about a girl named Alice, an imaginative girl out of place in her 19th century England. After being proposed to, she falls down the rabbit hole and finds herself in wonderland (they called it something else, but i couldn't tell)<br/><br/>From there on, we are introduced to numerous characters who's names I cant remember, most of whom are unmemorable. Johnny Depp does a great job as the Mad hatter, and Helen Bonham Carter does a good job as the Red Queen.<br/><br/>Im sure the book held great imagery and had a great message, but I found the film to be immensely typical. Alice at first believes she is in a dream, because all of what she sees has only been seen in dreams and is all impossible. But of course in the end she realizes her father was right and even the impossible is possible, she achieves her destiny, the mad hatter falls in love with her, they beat the red queen, and they all live happily ever after.<br/><br/>In other words, boring. It failed to make me care if Alice won.<br/><br/>The film had a great array of unrealistic visuals. The animated people clashed with some of the human actors, and none of the CGI was overly impressive considering where the market is at n0w. The film felt and looked like the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, without the excuse of being made several years ago. In fact, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe had much better visuals because it attempted a sort of realism, something Tim Burton has never cared for, and, until now, had not been a problem.<br/><br/>The worst part of this was the way it had clearly relied on 3D visuals to enhance the film. Im sure in 3D the film looked and felt amazing, but in 2D it looked silly.<br/><br/>Overall Alice in Wonderland is a weak, but not dismally bad, film with a few good actors that is worth watching if you have nothing better to do or if you, like the people i watched it with, have a Johnny Depp Fetish<br/><br/>2/5<br/><br/>Read more reviews @albobthinks.blogspot.com"

","Well I will say that this is certainly a different version, but the more I've watched it the more little details that I've noticed. The most interesting being the Hatter's eyes. I first noticed it when my kids and I were watching it at home. When he starts yelling at the Cheshire Cat right after Alice arrives his eyes turn almost the color of his hair, and the next shot, after the others yell his name, they're back to green. The longest shot of them that way is at the end when he has Stayne at sword point as Alice kills the Jaberwocky. Just about every time he starts talking in that Scotch accent of his they change his eye color. The most noticeable time they don't is when he and Alice are going to see the White Queen and he's reciting the parts of the poem Jaberwocky to her. <br/><br/>One of the other things are the flowers, if you've seen the Disney animated one recently look at the flowers when she first arrives. They really do look like some of the ones from the animated version. Most of the similarities are in the background characters, the ones that you might not notice on first viewing. <br/><br/>All in all its a very entertaining movie, It just takes a couple times watching it to get all the little bits, and jokes."

","Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is 19 and has suffered from strange dreams for half her life. She's an intelligent girl with little interest in the strict rules and etiquette of Victorian England; her unconventional thoughts bring disdain from those around her. She's expected to marry an arrogant British lord and she's unhappy with the direction her life is heading. On the afternoon of her engagement party, she runs off after a white rabbit and, after a short trip down a rabbit hole, finds herself in Underland. She discovers from the strange inhabitants that the land is under the tyrannical rule of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and it is believed she is the ""Alice"" destined to defeat the Queen's Jabberwocky and bring freedom from her reign.<br/><br/>All right, just to clarify, I've never read any of Lewis Carroll's original stories and I've had minimal exposure to Disney's 1951 animated film. Still, seeing as how I haven't spent my life under a rock, I know enough of the basics. As I understand, 2010's ALICE is a sequel of sorts, not a reboot and reimagining of the original story. The story's not bad, I suppose. I was digging the movie for the first hour or so, as Alice wanders through Underland and we're introduced to the interesting characters scattered throughout. That's about all that kept me interested, the characters and world design, since the story itself was pretty thin.<br/><br/>The casting for the film was fantastic, though some of them have been staples of Burton films and were a given. Most people speak of Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter; Depp does a great job but we all know he can play the weirdest of characters. This wasn't really a stretch for him and, after having seen his performance here, I'm itching to see him in a serious role again. Carter was fun as the Red Queen with her mega-cranium and her obsession with lopping off heads of anyone who so much as looks at her wrong. Crispin Glover was probably my favorite in the film (and almost unrecognizable) as Stayne, the knave of hearts who's flirtations with the Queen keep him in her good graces. We also run the full gamut of full-CG characters, from the hilariously manic March Hare to Absolem the hookah-smoking caterpillar (voiced by the awesome Alan Rickman, who almost seemed to be disinterestedly phoning in his performance here).<br/><br/>Despite what everyone around me seems to claim, this is nowhere near Tim Burton's best film. Sure, it's amazing to look at; the characters are beautifully designed (I can't stop staring at the oddness that are the Tweedles...) and the landscape is equal parts twisted and beautiful. Unfortunately for the film, that's all it is. It's an enjoyable watch but it feels empty at the end. It doesn't help that, after all the strange and colorful interactions that fill the film, it ends with an action sequence. It totally weakened the last half hour and I lost interest at that point, and the CG for the Jabberwocky was the only CG in the film that stood out (in a bad way).<br/><br/>Be warned: you should be prepared to watch the film in subtitles. Between the gibberish of the Underland language and Depp's tendency to slip into a thick Scottish brogue during the Hatter's moments of angry lucidity, there were some parts I just couldn't understand watching in theaters without the aid of subtitles to help (most of) it make more sense."

","""Excessive CGI is excessive. Well done excessive CGI is fluent and adds to the film."" - Steve Pulaski.<br/><br/>Rating: 3/4 stars.<br/><br/>Burton showed me a lot when I was younger. He showed me creativity, mystical worlds, creepy characters, eerie settings, and beautiful artistic films. I loved them when I was a kid. As Alice in Wonderland, I wasn't going crazy over the film. When it came time for it to come out, truthfully, I almost forgot. I had no interest in really seeing the film not being a hardcore fan of the original 1951 Disney movie of book. The film is just what I thought, not to bad, but not Burton's best at all. Its a passable film, but with its big potential behind it and fans all anxious to see it, it should have been a whole lot better.<br/><br/>Before I discuss the flaws, lets discuss the film. Protagonist Alice is at a party, which is later revealed to be an engagement party for her to wed Hamish Ascot. A rabbit who disappears and reappears constantly baffles Alice. When following the creature down the rabbit hole, she once again falls into the Underland. After being confused by numerous tricks once entering the Underworld, Alice meats Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb, The Chessire Cat, the famous Mad Hatter, and other famous characters from the book. Thats about the extent of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't awful by any means, but a lot of things could be improved. First off, the Mad Hatter seems like it took a lot of change in design before getting him to perfection. Thats fine, but it makes it look like all the other characters were rushed and not as magnificent or mastered as they could've been. Johnny Depp's performance as The Mad Hatter was very memorable and definitely the best I have seen this year next to Leo in Shutter Island. Though, let me tell you. He would surpass the 1950s detective if the movie he was in would have lived up.<br/><br/>Might I also mention that the movie felt like it was given a time limit before filming even started? It looks like they gave Burton the 100 minute deadline along with the sentence ""You guys need to put this anticipated masterpiece into a film no longer then 100 minutes."" The film feels very compressed with time and definitely could have been about forty-five minutes longer to show more impressive scenery. The CGI is excessive, but tolerable and fitting for this occasion. Which brings my all new saying ""Excessive CGI is excessive. Well done excessive CGI is fluent and adds to the film."" Last but not least I will say the performances are beautifully done and done with talent and effort. Matt Lucas, Anne Hathaway, and Johnny Depp give it their all not to mention Masik Wasikowaska as the lead role of Alice.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland is a dark sequel that is not the worst to come out of Burton. Though Edward Scissorhands and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory shockingly over-shadow this picture. I liked the movie to a certain extent, though I will look back on this film as a distant memory from my childhood, or quite possibly just an over-hyped film that just keeps delaying Tim Burton from releasing Frankenweenie.<br/><br/>Starring: Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Michael Sheen, and Stephen Fry. Directed by: Tim Burton."

Tim Burton was definitely a fan of, or at least well versed in, the original. My daughter and I agreed we did not like some of the unnecessary violence (pin in eye) and we did not care for the color of the chesshire cat (blue).

","Your grandmother may be dazzled with the outstanding special effects, but the story falls a bit short.

A coming-of-age Alice(Mia Wasikowsa)is none too please with a ""set-up"" wedding. On the lavish estate she spies a white rabbit with dangling pocket watch scoot into the brush. Following her curiosity with the rabbit, Alice falls down a hole that takes her to a very strange world filled unusual characters. There is a disappearing Cheshire Cat(Stephen Fry), a demanding Red Queen(Helena Bonham Carter), a Knave of Hearts(Crispin Glover) and a Mad Hatter(Johnny Depp). There are other colorful characters that all believe Alice has been sent to free their kingdom of Underland by vanquishing the dreaded Jabberwocky(Christopher Lee).<br/><br/>Not exactly living up to all the hype; but a vehicle for the very talented Depp. The visuals do make this whimsical tale memorable, but at times you look for a much welcomed conclusion.

","""All this talk of blood and slaying has put me off my tea.""<br/><br/>I'm generally supportive of continuations/re-imaginings of well-known stories and movies. If the new chapter turns out well, great! If it doesn't, you can always just ignore it and pretend that it never existed. Alice in Wonderland falls somewhere in-between those categories. It's worth-while enough to justify its own existence, but not good enough to stand beside the original stories, or the excellent Disney animated movie.<br/><br/>This movie seems more like an excuse to revisit the cool characters of the original stories, than a proper stand-alone movie. Some of them are great, like the Chesire Cat and the Red Queen. Others...well let's just say that I thought it was a horrible idea to turn the Mad Hatter into a major character and base so much of the movie around him. I understand WHY Disney made the choice to go in that direction (look at all the money it made them), but I thought that character was just horrible. Every scene he was in seemed like a forced parody of what Alice in Wonderland should be.<br/><br/>That's a microcosm of my main complaint with the movie. Too much of the charm and cleverness of Carroll's writing was ""Burtoned"" out of the movie, and replaced with Tim's always noticeable style. I'm not asking for him to unimaginatively copy the style of the source material, but whenever Johnny Depp was on the screen, the movie usually ceased resembling anything like Alice in Wonderland. <br/><br/>On the positive side, I thought Mia Wasikowska made a fine Alice (though the ""finding herself"" subplot seemed completely tacked on and under-developed). Some of the backgrounds and CGI were great. And as I said before, I thought the Chesire Cat and Red Queen were excellent. I had a decent time watching it...once I let go of my previous expectations and accepted the fact that this was going to be another example of Burton being Burton. For better, or for worse.   <br/><br/>I found myself wanting to like the movie, even in the face of its not so great aspects. Maybe if Burton could have reigned in his typical excesses a bit more, this could have been a great movie. As it stands, this is just another entry in The Wacky Adventures of Depp and Burton. With a slight Alice in Wonderland flavor."
"JamesHitchcock","6","0","4","18 June 2010"," ""Alice"" as it might have been had it been written by C.S. Lewis
","""Alice in Wonderland"" has been filmed several times, with a greater or lesser fidelity to the original story, but Tim Burton's recent version departs more radically from Lewis Carroll's text than virtually any other. Burton has said that he never felt a connection emotionally to the original, about a girl wandering around from one weird character to another, so he wanted to make it feel more like a story than a series of events.<br/><br/>His solution was, essentially, to film the book not as written by Carroll but as it might have been had it been written by C.S. Lewis. In the film, Alice is not a child but a young woman of nineteen. (Her surname is Kingsley, possibly a reference to Charles Kingsley, another Victorian children's writer). She is being pressurised by her family into an unwanted marriage with Hamish, a pompous young aristocrat, and running away from his unwelcome proposal, she falls down a rabbit hole and finds herself in Underland (as Wonderland is renamed here). Underland is under the tyrannical rule of the Red Queen, and Alice learns that she is the only one who can slay the Jabberwocky, a creature controlled by the Red Queen, thus freeing Underland from tyranny and restoring its rightful ruler, the White Queen, to the throne.<br/><br/>Although some, such as the Duchess and the Mock Turtle, are omitted, most of the characters in ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" make an appearance, along with some from its sequel ""Through the Looking-Glass"", but they are pressed into the service of the above plot, which resembles that of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" or ""Prince Caspian"" more than it does that of Carroll's novels. The Mad Hatter, for example, becomes a leader of the resistance to the Red Queen and Carroll's dormouse, originally a fat, sleepy creature, becomes a warrior-mouse reminiscent of Lewis' Reepicheep.<br/><br/>Lewis' ""Narnia"" stories are, of course, Christian allegories, and my initial thought that Burton might be trying to force ""Alice in Wonderland"" into the same mould became even stronger in the scenes near the end in which Alice puts on armour and arms herself with the Vorpal Sword in order to fight the dragon-like Jabberwocky. In these scenes Alice becomes a female equivalent of the heroic warrior-saints of traditional Christian iconography whose purpose is to symbolise the spiritual battle of good and evil, a sort of Saint Georgina and the Dragon, or Saint Michelle overcoming Satan.<br/><br/>Burton's urge to Christianise ""Alice in Wonderland"" may have been due to perceived similarities between Carroll and Lewis; both were, after all, Oxford dons and both were devout Christians. (Carroll was an ordained minister of the Anglican Church). Yet the two men were quite different as writers, and despite his religious beliefs Carroll never intended the ""Alice"" stories to be neat religious allegories. Indeed, they are not neatly constructed stories with a beginning, a middle and an end; their logic is that of the dream. They can be seen as nonsense novels or as examples of literary Surrealism long before that term was first applied to the visual arts.<br/><br/>This is not an altogether bad film. It is saved from a lower mark by two things. The first is the quality of some of the acting, especially from Helena Bonham Carter (a frequent Burton collaborator) as the Red Queen, a splendidly over-the-top villainess. The Red Queen is, in fact, a combination of the character of that name from ""Through the Looking Glass"" and the Queen of Hearts from ""Alice in Wonderland"". We learn that her first name is Iracebeth, a play on the word ""irascible"" and the name Elizabeth; her appearance, with her red hair and very pale skin, is clearly based on that of Queen Elizabeth I. I also liked Anne Hathaway's White Queen, not by any means a straightforward heroine. According to Hathaway, her character ""really likes the dark side, but is scared of going too far into it"", something certainly brought out in her interpretation. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter is completely weird, but in the context of this particular story that counts as praise rather than criticism.<br/><br/>The other factor in the film's favour is Burton's visual imagination, something as much in evidence here as in any of his other films. (The film is a mixture of live action and digital animation). Burton may have renamed Wonderland as Underland, but it still remains a strange and wondrous place. An example of his imagination is the character of the Bandersnatch, a ferocious beast mentioned by Carroll but never precisely described. Here it is portrayed as a mixture of hyaena, tiger, bulldog and pig, a curious combination but one fully in line with Carroll's imagination.<br/><br/>The Disney cartoon version of ""Alice"" also departs from Carroll's text, yet remains faithful to its spirit. (My favourite cinema version, however, remains the British musical from the seventies with Fiona Fullerton). I don't think that Tim Burton's version remains faithful in the same way. He takes a piece of dreamlike surrealism and turns it into a tale with a moral, or perhaps two morals. (The moral of the Underland section is ""Fight valiantly against the world, the flesh and the devil""; that of the quasi-feminist Victorian back-story can be summarised as ""Girl Power!""). If Burton never felt an emotional connection to the original stories, that might suggest that he was not the ideal person to direct a film based on them. 6/10"

","I was shocked after i saw this movie. This movie sucked. Though I was pretty amazed with the graphics. Alice goes in to another journey in wonderland where she reunites with her friends such as the Mad Hatter. They have to stop the red queen and it is said that Alice slays the Jabberwocky. The end battle scene was poorly made and poorly epic. This is a typical Tim Burton film but i'd say this was his worst film including planet of the apes.

","For me Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland is an interesting take on Lewis Carroll's classic story. I really did enjoy the film, and it's a well made film. I can understand why most fans of the novel are angry, but this is a totally different take on Carrol's novel. You've heard that the story happens when Alice is 19 and returns to Wonderland. Right off the bat, that should give you a hint that its not Lewis Carrol's classic Alice In Wonderland, shes not a child anymore. If you expected this, then of course you'll be disappointed. Alice In Wonderland is a well made, amusing film that if you can get by the fact that Alice is 19 and thinks shes constantly in a dream, then you will enjoy this film. Not Tim Burton's best film, but definitely not his worst. A very enjoyable take on the classic story by Lewis Carroll."

Hell, I'm surprised he didn't stared in the damn' thing.<br/><br/>But even thought Alice..."" amazes us with it's boundless Burthonesque creations (the CGI is top-notch) it misses the secret ingredient... the directing. Instead we get 3D! I could not shake the feeling that the story was heavily rushed, like someone would hastily flipped the pages of the book itself just to see what the ending is like. And in the process, stopped on the more interesting parts, with character introductions of Cheshire Cat voiced by Stepfen Cry (that's one cat you cannot simply please with milk & tuna), Blue Carterpillar, voiced by Alan Rickan of Profesor Snype fame (that smoking will be the end of you) or Mad Hatter (played by the audience-favorite Johnny Depp) who's a happy-sad mad-man, with amazing dancing skills.<br/><br/>Alice, played by Mia Wasikowska, gives a very bleak, dull & doubtful performance. From beginning to start of her journey in Wonderland, she shows no signs of amazement, deeply believing it's all a dream. Is that what happened to Wasikowska herself? She couldn't believe she was cast as Alice, and didn't know what to do with it? Seems so.<br/><br/>If Alice holds the story together as it's MAIN PROTAGONIST it is the Red Queen (played by Helena Bonham Carter) and the Mad Hatter that keep it interesting. They're both trying to outmatch each other in who can be most WHACK but still most believable in the WHACKNESS. I mean, as much as you can think believable"" in Wonderland.<br/><br/>The Red Queen seems to have a lot on her head, and clearly doesn't want too many heads to be around (Off with his head"" is her signature catchphrase). And the Mad Hatter is just trying to stick to the remains of his sanity. Luckily, there's not much of it.<br/><br/>There's one scene in Alice in Wonderland"" that made me hold on to my seat a bit tighter... It wasn't the Epic-size battle, or the chase by the over-sized cat-like creature. It was something more... subtle.<br/><br/>It was when Alice, after a bit of a struggle, opens the small door that leads her to Wonderland. I could not stop thinking of a similar scene, where a girl by the name of Dorothy, after landing"" her house, opens up it's door and walks into a scenery of vivid, over-saturated color...<br/><br/>Sadly, Alice in Wonderland"" is not The Wizard of Oz"". It is a miscalculation, where the amazing cast, latest technology, and a film director who's gone mad, turned out to be no match for Lewis Carroll's novel. Maybe some musical numbers would have done the trick?"

However, a close second would be this Lewis Carroll tome and just about any type of hallucinogen, from LSD to psychedelic toad secretion.<br/><br/>Years after her first visit, 19-year-old Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to the topsy-turvy realm of Wonderland, which is now under the rule of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and her terribly nonsensical pet-monster the Jabberwocky. Unaware of her previous visits, Alice is reintroduced to the inhabitants of Wonderland, including The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), who assist in her plan to overthrow the Red Queen.<br/><br/>Under the assumption that everyone is all ready familiar with the legendary tale, director Tim Burton foregoes the process of unearthing strange characters and environments and, instead, delves headlong into a dark and depressing version of Wonderland that's littered with an array of melancholy characters that fail to either engage or entertain.<br/><br/>And while chasing a white rabbit may lead children to a fantastical world, more often than not, they'll just lead them to an animal-testing facility.

"MetalAngel","6","0","1","2 June 2010"," A nice thing to watch but NOT to remember.
","Yes, Tim Burton is a director one should marvel about. He's directed such masterpieces like ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and the somewhat recent ""Sweeney Todd"", but like many other immortal directors he has a flaw. He's a visual genius who creates entire worlds out of scratch and quirky, involving characters that haunt our minds for many days to come...but he usually focuses too much on the visual aspect of his films and the result is that many of them lack the necessary luster in their story lines or character development, and its his characters precisely the ones who try to reach over audiences but who ultimately fail to do so in most cases. His latest box-office smash ""Alice in Wonderland"" is an example of one such film, where every scene is a breath-taking picture that fails to remain in our hearts and minds in the end.<br/><br/>We shouldn't be too hard on him, though. I mean this IS Lewis Carroll adapted to the screen, and the film is based on both ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"" two heavily surrealist books for children which never focus on plot but rather on frequently non-sensical situations. The film has an additional twist, also: 19-year old Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to Wonderland without a previous memory of ever being there before, where she discovers her ultimate destiny is to defeat a monstrous dragon commanded by the villainous Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter, who plays her role to comic perfection). To do so she'll need the help of the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum (both played by Matt Lucas), the Cheshire cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), the Blue Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman) and many others. The film is rank with quirky, Burton-esquire characters which are paraded before us one after the other and are seldom given a chance to actually make an impression.<br/><br/>These characters do wonders with the few time that's given to them, though. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are especially hilarious in their lead roles, and most of the animated characters actually manage to make us laugh (the March Hare, voiced by Paul Whitehouse, is especially funny albeit the fact he's on screen for less than ten minutes). The film's point, much like the book, is to take children through an imaginary fantasy where nothing makes sense; but like many recent children' books adapted to the screen, an actual storyline has been introduced which tries to make sense and be profound but which fails entirely.<br/><br/>A point which has critics and audiences in high debate is the CGI aspect of the film. Over 80% of the film is animated, and all of the flesh-and-blood actors have had their features exaggerated and altered with computer imaging; Burton's famous settings and Gothic magical landscapes are all animated now, giving them additional beauty and quirkiness but taking away every sense of wonder they had before. I mean, remember Edward Scissorhands' dark castle or Halloweentown? Now imagine them being CGI'd, paired with sweeping, fleeting camera takes. A pity, isn't it? The magical realism is lost, the artistic meaning behind Burton's film is diminished and we're left with an adventure comedy kids are bound to adore but adults are bound to quickly dismiss.<br/><br/>Costume design and production design are perfect, as usual. Everything is meticulously detailed and it's a breath of fresh air to see actual art direction and production amongst all the CGI. The costumes the humans wear are a marvel of the imagination (but then again, it's Colleen Atwood, Burton's long-time costume designer, so what can you expect?). Danny Elfman's score is sadly forgettable, and I find this hard to digest since he's the composer of some of Hollywood's greatest scores ever. The plot is...well, disappointing even while factoring in the fact that it should be a plot-less movie. Why, Luis Buñuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"" had a more intriguing plot and you ALL know how sarcastic I'm being by saying that. Burton's direction is interesting enough, but this isn't bound to be a film he'll be remembered for.<br/><br/>Now, that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. It's VERY entertaining, as a matter of fact. I felt engrossed by the fleeting characters and the wonderful production design throughout the entire film, and once it was finished I had a sense that my time had not been wasted (much more than I can say for recent Hollywood flicks). It's a film full of blunders, though, and it's so much less than Burton is accustomed to give us that, even through its excellent points I fail to be much impressed. Oh, and poor Lewis Carroll; if he only knew how screenwriter Linda Woolverton has massacred his stories! See it, just for the hell of it. I liked it...but not too much. Rating: 2 stars and a half out of 4!"
"thundertnt","2","0","1","2 June 2010"," utter drivel!
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have always been a golden combination, as far back as ""edward scissor hands"". Tim Burton as good as a director as he is (or now, perhaps was) has always taken on directing movies that were themed to match his style as a director. obvious examples of this include ""Batman"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". When I heard that Tim Burton decided to take on Alice In Wonderland, with Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter, I was extremely excited to see his take on it. I was an avid fan of the original Walt Disney film and the novel it was based on by Lewis Carrol. Both contain a psychedelic sense of whimsical humour that contains interesting flaws in formal logic. How did Tim Burton screw this up??? The movie has no whimsical charm for everyone to enjoy, no flaws in formal logic for philosophy buffs like myself, and can't even pull off being a good head-movie for people who have smoked a couple before entering the theatre. What we have here is dry uninspired Harry Potter type film with character's that barely represent Lewis Carrol's novel. It's a sequel with one or two allusions to the original source material, and a dry lifeless story, that drags on and on as you stare at the screen looking for an Alice in Wonderland film. An utter disappointment and absolute garbage!!! How did this happen and Why?!?"

It seems as though they just gave up on the story and decided to finish it loud and fast, which is shameful as the movie gets so many things right.<br/><br/>In all honesty, had I seen this film as a child I would have loved it and found it extraordinary.

","I have read through many reviews of this movie before I watched it. It seems that critics in general find the story poorly written, as if Burton took the original book and failed to make it into a movie. This certainly is correct to a certain point and if you expect this movie to be an exact transcription of the book, you will be disappointed. I wasn't however. As a matter of fact I have greatly enjoyed watching this movie from the very first to the very last second. And the sole reason for that is that this movie is a classic Burton all the way. It's a story about a picturesque world where dreams and reality blur. It's a story driven by a simple idea of believing in your dreams. And Tim Burton is a man known to be a nine-days wonder in such condition. While I was watching this movie, his dream has become my reality. This man can deliver the most grotesque out-of-the-way scene with nonchalant negligence. You can feel that he couldn't be bothered with realism of the story simply because for him, the story was real. And if you allow it, this dreamy fairy tale can become just as real for you... All you have to do is forget that there was some book written by a guy who called himself Lewis Carrol and let yourself fully immerse into one of the most beautiful portrayals of a dream-scape ever created."

","THIS IS ONE story that is most likely widely familiar to a really wide cross section of the public. It had been adapted seemingly countless times to both the Big Screen of the Cinema, to the Small Picture Tube in our Living Rooms. Each we've seen has been markedly different from the next; each having strong points and corresponding frailties.<br/><br/>OTHER THAN TODAY'S honored title, ALICE IN WONDERLAND (Disney/Buena Vista, 2010), the two versions that immediately come to our mind are Paramount Pictures' 1933 All Star Spectacular and the Walt Disney (by the real,original Walt) 1951 full length animated extravaganza. This latest version would seem to combine certain strong suit features of both; while still managing to throw in liberally portioned amounts of additional elements of its own.<br/><br/>WHILE THE EARLIEST of these three, ALICE IN WONDERLAND (Paramount, 1933)had the novelty of using just about everyone at Paramount at that particular time; much of its desired 'Star Power' is neutralized with the use of heavily crafted costume, make up and intricate and sometimes frighteningly gross latex masks. The only one not affected would have to be young Miss Charlotte Henry; whose delicate beauty and youthful innocence are the best features of the film.<br/><br/>ALL OF THE others are acting out roles in virtually anonymous disguise to such a degree that their parts may well be classified as that of 'voice only' actors. Folks such as Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, W.C. Fields, Roscoe Ates and Jack Oakie may be identified by way of voice recognition and credits in the cast.<br/><br/>SIMILARLY, OUR NEW version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND (Disney, 2010) does have a most formidable line up of talent in its cast; which, of course, is not limited by any Studio Star System; that having become as extinct as the Dodo Bird, the Passenger Pigeon or Photomat. Being mainly voice over, the credits prove to be more important than ever; particularly with some portrayals, such as Mr. Christopher Lee as the Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>WHILE OUR 2010 version brings us the physical appearance of the various characters that would appear to have been very closely adapted from the old book illustrations, they still tend to gravitate toward the bizarre tastes of Director Tim Burton. There is none of the old tried and true Walt Disney principle of having the animated characters have at least some resemblance to their individual voice creators. Hence, we can see this in evidence in the physical appearance of The Mad Hatter (Ed Wynn), The March Hare(Jerry Colona), White Rabbit (Bill Thompson) and The Queen of Hearts (name here).<br/><br/>THIS VERSION HAS all of the modern cinematic wonders going for it; what, with digital stereo sound, big screen (even Imax version), full digitally rendered color, various computer generated special FX and 3 Dimensional vision.* FOR ALL ITS supercharged features, we find the movie going experience just so-so. It was okay, but no future classic. Like any true-blue member of the Post World War II Baby Boom, we prefer Mr. Disney's 1951 animated version.<br/><br/>WE GUESS THAT this makes us just a trifle jaded; or maybe just getting old. Well, that's not bad; when you consider the alternative! NOTE: * Ah 3-D! How well we remember the 3D craze of our youth; and that's over a half century ago! Then we had 3D Movies, 3D Comic Books everywhere. Well, as the old French proverb says; ""The more things change, the more they stay the same!"" Just think that one over, Schultz!"

","A few months ago I accompanied the international students at UNCG on a trip to New York City. It was my second visit, and I spent two days in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) trying to enter the Tim Burton exhibit (which closes today). When I finally got in on day 2, I was surprised to see the sheer number of artifacts on display. Burton has a habit of drawing the characters for his movies before he films them. I found original designs for everything from Batman to Planet of the Apes. The look he creates for the characters is carefully integrated into their on screen appearance. Nothing from Alice in Wonderland was available and, in retrospect, is my biggest disappointment with the exhibit. Everything we see in the computerized fantasy world of this film is uniquely his. He must have spent as much time designing the scenery of Alice as much as he did the characters. The movie has the video game aesthetic of Avatar with varying creativity of multifaceted level design. The story takes a back seat into irrelevancy as the spectacle unfolds. Burton draws from his early animated works for a few characters and live animals for others. It has the effect of creating a wholly unbelievable fantasy world. You really have to see it to believe it. A nineteen year-old Alice finds herself in Wonderland after refusing to be married to some milquetoast loser. She discovers the other world is in shambles after an era of tyrannical rule by the Red Queen (Helena Bonham-Carter). Burton has a lot of fun bringing the campiness out of his wife in this pic. He blew up her head to extraordinary sizes with Windows Movie Maker, covered it pantomime makeup, and made her watch a ton of crappy Disney princess films. In all of those movies, the ""evil stepmother"" character deliberately speaks in an exaggerated manner that signifies her as the villain. Her dialog is in obvious contrast to how everyone else speaks. Bonham-Carter is a plays the evil stepmother (or queen this time) with the added touch of Burton's zany sense of humor. Alice meets the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) who is the rightful ruler to the kingdom. Hathaway gets the opportunity to relive her early Disney career as the princess archetype and enriches the film experience by flailing her arms about and skipping from place to place. Apparently there is some prophecy that Alice will defeat the Red Queen's greatest servant Jabberwocky and save the wonderworld. She does this and returns to England to begin another life. Outside of the intriguing visuals, this version of Alice offers little more than traditional frenetic blockbuster fair. I never grow tired of Burton's artistry, so I'll give it a pass. The 3D does not enhance the experience as apparently it was filmed in 2D. I think it's as visually stimulating as Avatar, yet it still doesn't reach Cameron's otherworldly feel.<br/><br/>Recommended"

Also, Anne Hathaway's character really showed her soft side, and different skills of acting that she has. Helena was perfect to play the red queen because of her fierce attitude. Her makeup was fantastic as well as Johnny Depp's. Tim Burton being the director helped make the movie what it is. His quirky weird style added that ""umph"" that made the movie what it is."

","I watched this movie last night. I saw it in 3D IMAX. I enjoyed the movie, I chucked a few times. The movie was described to me as 'Alice in wonderland' but I was under the impression it was more of a 'part 2' thing. In reality it's a little of both. It's pretty much the story but more of why Alice was chosen to be the one who went through the looking glass. I have to compare this movie to the only version I know and that is the cartoon that we all saw as kids. The movie is not going to win any awards but the acting was good. Never saw the appeal to Anne Hathaway but in the movie she was good as the White Queen and I finally saw why some say she's attractive. Johnny Depp was really good as the Mad Hatter. Much better then the first movie, you see the point of having this character. My wife loved the Cheshire Cat and I did as well. They got the right guy to do the voice for him. Really speaks to you that this is right for the cat. Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen was a good choice. She really does well in this role. Tweedledee and Tweedledum are funny and you again see a point to this character. I don't know why but the Blue Caterpillar really got to me. The voice actor nailed it. I don't even remember this character in the first one but I really like it in this movie. I read that Johnny Depp was praised by the critics for his work in this one but that he is upstaged by an animal. I hope they were referring to the caterpillar. The only one who doesn't do a good job in this movie is Alice!!! I just wasn't as interested when she was on screen and it's not that everyone else was so good, it's just that she just wasn't good enough and that you waited for her scene or sentence to finish to get someone else in there.

In the final battle scene there's also a hard-to-miss Coalition of the Willing. The impossibly beautiful and sanctimonious White Queen most clearly represents the United Nations - as perceived, that is, by the right-wing pro-war camp. For those of the opposite persuasion, of course, there is the smug satisfaction of knowing the whole heroic ""Alice-to-the-rescue"" thing is nothing but a delusional fantasy. There's something for both sides to take from this movie, which makes it a shrewd double-headed winner for Mr Burton. Having said that, I really enjoyed it."

","The movie was pretty good. After reading the other reviews i found out that the movie was originally supposed to be in 2D but later they converted it into 3D. This makes it not the best 3D movie but the things that were added are pretty cool. A few new elements and characters are added from the book but are for positive side. The story is very interesting and does not drag on at all. My girlfriend and I enjoyed it a a lot where she read the books and was a little weary it didn't exactly stay true to the story with the new characters and added features to spice up the story. The visuals were awesome, it wasn't boring at all and i am glad i went to see it. It has made a lot of money and i would suggest seeing it."
"markgorman","7","0","3","27 March 2010"," Good but not great. Less would have been more.
","First off. Go see the 2D version. The 3D adds nothing.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is my favourite unpredictable director. Sweeney Todd and The Nightmare Before Christmas are both works of genius, but most of the rest have deep flaws. Alice in Wonderland is nearer the former than the latter (although my fellow viewers erred towards the latter).<br/><br/>Tim has thrown the kitchen sink at this one. The effects (putting aside the 3D) are at times jaw dropping and some of his little vignettes are a delight (the Red Queen's guilty frogs in particular). And Mrs Burton, Helena Bonham Carter, can surely never have been better in a completely show-stealing role. She is hilarious.<br/><br/>But it's too long and it's overloaded with ideas to the point that it begins to wash over you.<br/><br/>I like Johnny Depp in this, but my wife didn't. He's mad. But then, he plays a mad hatter.<br/><br/>7/10."
"ElvenNights","7","0","1","26 March 2010"," New but not inventive. Storywise, mediocre at best.
","Some new film releases are a must see in the theatre. 3D movies at the top of that list. Others simply are placed at the head of the line to be viewed for free off of an internet posting. You can find the site for yourselves. Unfortunately, while I previously felt Alice in Wonderland to be one of the former, once again I was stuck watching a lack luster film not fulfilling it's true potential. This is another 3D movie where you take a look with your glasses off and the screen looks pretty much the same. Remember when a 3D movie meant that one would have characters practically reciting lines from your lap. Not anymore.<br/><br/>While Wonderland begins with promise, colorful and interesting characters, a lush backdrop, the hint of a darker Tim Burton fueled adventure, it soon gets lost in a substandard dull plot. It seems to be the norm these days to begin with a good idea and then meander the other three quarters of a film into an unimaginative subplot. The CGI was outstanding. The bandersnatch looked amazing and I loved the army of lance wielding red cards. I also enjoyed the majority of the acting. Mia was a refreshing change of pace as Alice and Bonham Carter put a nice bit of vulnerability and humor into her portrayal as the Red Witch. Ann Hathaway however, while attractive, was horrible with her clichéd good witch rendition as the White Witch. Totally kills the believability and energy of the characters.<br/><br/>I understand that this is based on a children's story so I won't nit pick too much. Visually stunning (however not much difference seen in 3D as opposed to not), but story wise only mediocre. Seven out of ten. Not a must see in the theatre. If buying more than two tickets don't waste your money. Watch it online or wait for the DVD which will probably be out before the summer fully hits."

"Philby-3","7","0","3","25 March 2010"," Not much Carroll, but a visual treat
","This film reminds me of one of those recipes where you take all the pulp out of something like a red pepper or an eggplant, chop it all up, add lots of other things, stuff it all back in and bake the stuffed object at a high temperature for a goodly time. The result is interesting but doesn't bear much relationship to the original. Technically the film is a sequel rather than an adaptation of the original books by Lewis Carroll, but while much use is made of the physical aspects of Carroll's characters the essence of the books, the absurd logic and the teasing ideas is displaced by a fairly conventional kid's adventure story – Avatar for the under 12s.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the whole thing is visually splendid and beautifully rendered in 3-D. Mia Wasikowska is a gorgeous 19 year old Alice and the supporting cast of great and famous British and (odd) American actors can hardly be faulted. Even 92 year old Michael Gough popped up as the voice of the Dodo. Anne Hathaway's make-up made her look more like a New Orleans brothel keeper than the White Queen, and Crispin Glover's Stayne was less comic than was called for, but by and large the main parts are very well done. Johnny Depp as the only mildly Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red (""off with his head)"" Queen were right in character and Stephen Fry positively purred his way along as the Cheshire Cat.<br/><br/>We might have all read the books in this case, but Tim Burton was not out to give us a faithful adaptation. Disney as producers has not always done well with Alice in Wonderland – an interesting animated version which followed the books closely tanked in 1952 – and this time the studio was taking no chances. The few kids at the screening I saw seemed to like it well enough but there wasn't quite the enthusiasm I saw in ""Avatar."""
"jdkraus","7","0","1","25 March 2010"," Beautifully done yet it runs into a big cliché
","I watched the old ""Alice In Wonderland"" cartoon when I was a kid and I found it both weird and scary. Every single creature Alice encountered, it seemed to either taunt her or intended to due her harm. Heck, even the part when Alice broke down and cried, I sobbed along with her. <br/><br/>Though a traumatic event in my childhood, I couldn't resist the temptation of Johnny Depp teaming up with Tim Burton once again for their take on the frightening, bizarre, and disturbing tale of ""Alice in Wonderland"". <br/><br/>Now I expected this movie to be a remake of the 1950s cartoon, but instead it is a sequel. Alice, now 19, is forced into a marriage by her mother but as fate would have it, she sees a white rabbit with a ticking clock and chases after him into an endless hole, which then follows into another series of unfortunate events, somewhat like before, but yet with a totally different plot. This time, Alice has a purpose in Wonderland, to conquer the Red Queen and her fierce servant, the Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>The cast for this movie is impeccable. Beneath the top hat and make up, Johnny Depp, probably one of the most versatile acts of our time, is simply brilliant as The Mad Hatter. Helena Bonham Carter, as the Red Queen is likewise irresistible. Her figure, demeanor, (and with the help of the wonderful make up design) makes her into her character. I can't help but smile as she shouts, ""Off his head!"" <br/><br/>Mia Wasikowska as Alice and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen are also decent in their roles, (I particularly love Hathaway's stark contrast from the Red Queen as a loving, yet somewhat quirky character), but the real geniuses are Depp and Carter and the remarkable voice talents of Michael Sheen (the White Rabbit), Alan Rickman (the Caterpillar), and Stephen Fry (the Cheshire Cat) to name a few. <br/><br/>The visual effects, costumes, and set designs are all beautiful, and there's some pretty cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. His work somewhat reminds me of Andrew Lesnie's mesmerizing work for ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" in that it is colorful but at the same time a bit desaturated, which helps add the dark mood that looms in Wonderland. His work is very noticeable in the locations of the Red and White Queen's castlesone brightly illuminated, the other, dark and haunted. Danny Elfman's score adds another layer of darkness, mystery, and beauty to the film, though at times it seemed a bit bombastic.<br/><br/>Despite all of this greatness to the film, it runs into a problem. Like most fantasy films nowadays, it all leads to a big battle sequence, which we have seen in almost every other movie. It has almost become a cliché that all fantasy epics most end in a big battle sequence. And on top of that, the movie feels rushed. The movie's pace is excellent; I was interested in it from start to finish, but 1 hour and 40 minutes seems a little short to cover all the details that are contained in the movie's story. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, this treat by Tim Burton is a good film, thought not for the whole family, due to some surprising grisly images that should have made the rating at least a PG-13. The atmosphere on top of that isn't child oriented either. This then makes me wonder what was the audience Tim Burton was aiming for. It's certainly not a kid's movie, but it's not necessarily a movie that most adults would go see. Then again, the whole Alice in Wonderland concept really isn't a child's story either. I'm not sure. Anyway, I'm glad I got a chance to see this movie.<br/><br/>***/****"

","I don't know why comments on Tim Burton's remake of Alice in Wonderland are mostly negative. I actually liked it. The whacky and modern day twists helped the movie to avoid from being labeled as dated. There was peculiarity with each characters but the role of Red Queen was simply hilarious. The rabbit, the twins, the disappearing cat, the dog longing to unite his family and finally hatter all were fun to watch. Anne Hathway as White Queen also did her role effectively. But the winner and applaud goes to production designing and visual effect team. The team truly created a wonderland. I hated the old version just because it is labeled as a classic."
"joshua_s_reeves","7","0","1","24 March 2010"," Great visuals, not so good when it comes to the story
","Much of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland's original beauty was found in its courageous imagination and unpredictable tone. Adaptations of the novel never seem to fully get a grip of the text because of the fact it's so bizarre. It was with no surprise, then, that back in 2008 I didn't feel any excitement to hear Disney was making another adaptation of the much beloved story. That was until I heard that it wasn't going to be an adaptation, but a sequel, and furthermore the sequel was going to be helmed by one filmmaker that is used frequently to define the words strange and unpredictable: Tim Burton.<br/><br/>So it was the thought in my mind, and should be of every viewer when walking into the cinema with their 3-D glasses in hand, that I would not judge the film on its faithfulness to the source material, but rather on its own merit to use Carroll's novel as inspiration. And what inspiration Burton harnessed to bring an outstanding 3-D visual experience. Wonderland, or Underland as it is officially referred to, is both haunting and stunning with live-action footage being expertly blended with animation. Audiences will become completely immersed in Burton's imagining of Wonderland which will, unfortunately, give viewers the opportunity to realise that Woolverton's script hasn't hit the perfect note that her previous works have.<br/><br/>The film is set years after Alice's original trip to Wonderland joining a 19 year old Alice who is expected to wed a snobbish young lord. Within the first hour Alice has found her way back to Wonderland introducing viewers to her destiny, to defeat the dreaded Jabberwocky, and to Depp's brilliantly portrayed Hatter along with a handful of other outstanding performances. The script is both engaging and funny, with Bonham Carter's Red Queen comically bellowing ""Off with his head!"" Well, it's engaging up until the point Alice finds herself in the Red Queen's castle, which is where the film appears to loose most of its momentum as it seems to just anticipate the final act where Alice will face off the mighty Jabberwocky.<br/><br/>It picks up a little at the end when we finally see Alice's personal journey of self-fulfilment accomplished, but the brilliant battle sequence which sees her doing so doesn't leave a lasting impression which seems to be a consequence of its build up. My advice is if you to watch a film in the coming weeks, go see either Shutter Island or Kick-Ass. If not, see Burton's new spectacle which will be remembered for its visuals and performances but sadly not for its story."

I came out of the theater wondering if it were just the mediocre script or the director who had failed to meet my expectations. The best part of this movie is probably Johnny Depps portrayal of the mad hatter who truly is mad. However, Mia Wasikowska presents Alice in a dull manner that had me checking my watch every ten or fifteen minutes. Overall this film isn't awful, but at the same time its no masterpiece, for an interesting film to look at I suppose this would be an alright choice, however if you want a great story and compelling acting, you might want to check out something else, because this isn't the movie you're looking for."

That whole plot line could have been avoided with no ill effects on the movie. The special effects are amazing to say the least. Johnny Depp is weird as usual, but he is very entertaining. I could have gone without another movie with Tim Burtons wife in it. That's getting a little bit old.

"jar4677","8","0","1","20 March 2010"," Old Art Direction, Still Gets Me
","Ah, Tim Burton, you're so predictable some times. Whenever we go to your movies there are a few things we can expect. Johnny Depp with weird hair, speaking strangely. Your wife, Helena Bonham Carter, with weird hair, speaking strangely. A certain art direction that makes us feel like we're on the canvas of a painting that is in the process of being painted. The colors are vibrant and not particularly blended together yet. None of these things are bad in principle but I, for one, have begun to wonder how many times you can play these notes and produce an interesting film. When I went to the theater to see your latest, Alice in Wonderland, I admit that I was expecting to not be caught up in the world you created but distracted by so many familiar images. Well, you got me!<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland, as created by Walt Disney animation sixty years ago, has become so much a part of the American culture that I, at least, thought I knew what to expect from Tim Burton's new live-action version. Just the same story but with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter with weird hair, speaking strangely. What I got was a new vision, still old art direction but, as usual, it worked. All the expected characters are there, the white rabbit, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Cheshire Cat and of course the Mad Hatter. But Alice is more grown up than I expected and she faces challenges that are equally grown up. <br/><br/>The progression of the film is about as uneven as Johnny Depp's accent throughout the film and there are moments when the sound mixers ought to have turned up the volume on the dialog. But, let's be honest, Tim Burton's films are not about plot progression or sound mixing. They are about the art direction, the story and Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter sporting weird hair and speaking strangely. This movie delivers on all those things. The story is engaging even when we can't understand what the characters are saying and the art direction suits it well. So, for all my protestation of late that Tim Burton should do something different. I have to eat my words and say that I'm glad he didn't do so on this occasion."
"MartianOctocretr5","7","0","1","20 March 2010"," Alice in 3-D land
","Most of Alice's return as an adult to Wonderland works pretty well, but there are flaws.<br/><br/>The first portion of her original adventure is reviewed exactly for foundation: rabbit hole, etc., but once she encounters the caterpillar and other characters, the story goes its own direction, introducing a prophecy of an epic event involving the reluctant and skeptical Alice.<br/><br/>The special effects are dazzling, the 3-D effect utilized for brilliant and stunning visuals. It truly is a ""wonderland,"" come to life. The characters are honed a bit to fit the new direction of the story's purpose. Tweedledee and Tweedledum, as a typical example, are evolved in this version from their senseless imitative behavior in the Carroll book now to Igor-type side kicks at Alice's beckon call. Most glaringly altered, of course, is the Mad Hatter, to fit Johnny Depp's approach. Depp's characterization is clever and well acted, but the Hatter's new altruistic and heroic nature is far removed from the selfish nut Alice met in Carroll's book.<br/><br/>The two queens provide the conflict, and contrast well. Bonham-Carter's megalomaniac Red Queen (""Off with his head!"") is spot on, and the running gag about her head shape is fun. Hathaway's eccentric yet benevolent White Queen is equally humorous. The chess match war is composed impressively, and the dragon battle tops it all off nicely.<br/><br/>Biggest negative: The opening/closing sequences in the real world don't work, and aren't even necessary. Alice did not need her Wonderland adventure to make decisions that she made in the end. Somebody must have said, ""We need a moral tag to close the story!"" To whoever said that, Burton should have proclaimed, ""Off with his head."" It just doesn't work to slam home an idea that the viewer already gets. If anything, it's patronizing. Another problem was abandoning the random nature of the books; the whole satirical point of the disjointed chaos is contradicted with this version's ""destiny to overthrow evil"" business.<br/><br/>Overall, superior visuals and a nice cast give this some of the fun weirdness that you'll expect. But don't expect the original books; this one strays into its own Wonderland."

","I'm a huge fan of the original Disney cartoon, so I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect. What I got, was something that, truth be told, I really enjoyed. It was a wonderful adventure into 'Underland', Wonderland's bigger sister with darker undertones and a revamped sense of style.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland is in classic Tim Burton-esquire style... colourful, bright, beautfiully dark and memorable. The characters were well portrayed and brought back memories of the cartoon. Stand out performances included Helena Bonham-Carter, who to me stole the show with her rendition of the Red Queen (everytime she came on I was mesmerized with her facial expressions, manner of speaking etc), and Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter who, although not seeming as mad as the cartoon version, still made the character seem a little crazy yet unexpectedly attractive. He gave the Hatter a lot more depth than expected, which makes you think twice about this seemingly shallow character.<br/><br/>Mia Wasikowska who played Alice did a good job, she portrayed Alice as how I think Tim Burton wanted her to - confused, in denial, and then in control. I enjoyed her performance. The CGI animals were also very well done, in particular the Cheshire Cat voiced by Stephen Fry (so fluffy you just wanted to reach out and pat him), and the Blue Caterpillar voiced by the brilliant Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>I saw this movie in 3D, but I don't think I would again. If you're going to see it in 3D... don't expect anything huge. This isn't an Avatar. In fact, I think I would've preferred to have seen this in 2D so I could appreciate the colours and brightness of the film.<br/><br/>I have never read the books, but from what I saw, I really enjoyed. My advice to people wanting to know whether to bother or not, is to go see it, and make up your OWN mind. I liked it, maybe you will too."

Tim Burton's attempt is pretty much the same, only he has felt compelled to add an unimaginative backstory to justify the characters' motivation. Mr. Carroll never required his book to make sense Therein lay its charm. Mr. Burton's retelling has none. His Alice declares her independence from others expectations, then proceeds to follow them. Unfortunately for us, we also know what's expected of her, and so there is no drama to be had in the otherwise colorful and artfully designed spectacle.

","Alice in Wonderland is a fantasy movie based on the Lewis Carroll's book ""Through the Looking-Glass"". The point of a movie following the second book ? Whatever.... The story itself is done let's say good for an 1 hour and half movie. I expected a little bit more of it but at the end I was quite entertained and satisfied with the result. It was magical but not that magical, it was a happy movie and not made to be a serious weirdness but more of a crazy wildness.<br/><br/>Tim Burton succeeded to transform Alice's story into an epic visual experience. The best part of the movie is that the visual effects (especially in 3D) were mastered wonderful. The beauty of the environments along with the 3D effects threw you into an mesmerizing world. As I said the visual experience was top notch but the acting was even better.<br/><br/>The Red Queen portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter stole the show. She was magnificent and each scene with her was awesome. Seems like Tim Burton's ""fetish"" for his wife to appear in his movies succeeded this time on a big level. The Mad Hatter played by Johnny Depp wasn't that Mad and I think I expected more from him though his portrayal is on point as usual. I didn't really liked Mia as Alice. Don't know why but I can't find her attractive enough to really enjoy her presence on the screen and her acting as Alice wasn't that great. Another character I enjoyed was Cheshire the Cat which was so cool to watch.<br/><br/>The ridiculous moment of the movie were I was like ""OH snap! What the hell?"" was on Depp's dancing... I mean breakdance? modern dance moves? Why that? And that music? ...I think that simple scene ruined big part from the movie. The music was cut and edited well during the movie, but I still try to figure out why Tim Burton had not asked for an entire composed soundtrack. That would have fitted this world so much better.<br/><br/>About the CGI, I noticed some mistakes, like the horse-riding looks so animated....which I think they could have just used a real horse. Some of the fight scenes were poor cut and so on, but in the end we could skip on that.<br/><br/>In the end ... this movie is not such a great adaptation by Tim Burton, not such of an extraordinary movie but a wonderful visual experience along with one great performance by the Red Queen.<br/><br/>I'd give it a 7,5 but I can't so I gave it an 8 to raise the bar."

","This film was high on being a theme ride. Okay, it made a lot of money and in business, that is the bottom line, but the truth remains, it was too scared to go into ""mood"" in fear of losing it's audience. Too afraid to be wonderous and quiet for too long. Instead, it caved more on the Indiana Jones theme park ride format. ALICE AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM rather than Alice in Wonderland. The acting is top notch by everyone. The make up for Johnny Depp made him more scary than sympathetic and yet his character is suppose to evoke the same kind of sympathy that Ray Bolger did in The Wizard of Oz? It didn't happen. If the film wasn't so mean loud and violent, I would say his interpretation would have had a better chance. Not since Anna Quayle as the child hating baroness in CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG was there as good a queen as Helena Bonham Carter. Her queen in mesmerizing. You can't keep your eyes off her. One gets the sense that Tim Burton can't get past his dark childhood or whatever it was back there that makes his movies depressing. His wonderland is expensive and full of Transformer type atmosphere at ear splitting levels.

"celestial_princess","4","0","1","16 March 2010"," Misleading
","Having read the original Lewis Carroll book ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass"" (a gift for my 22nd birthday), I had been looking forward to seeing this adaption of the story. I can honestly say that this movie's adaptation is a far cry from the original story of Alice. *Warning: This is more a criticism of the overall movie than an actual review, so you may not want to read any further if you plan to see it* <br/><br/>I knew upon seeing the commercials and movie poster that the costumes would be overly freakish and nothing like Lewis Carroll would ever have imagined, but the movie itself is not like the book at all. In fact, the place where Alice goes is now called ""Underland"", thus completely disavowing the title (Then again, who would have gone to see ""Alice in Underland""?)! The movie is about a grown-up Alice (19 years old and being proposed to by an idiotic lord) returning to Wonderland (Underland) to defeat the Red Queen and slay the Jabberwock on the Frabjous Day. This is where I'm going to get nit-picky: The plot itself is wrong. For those not familiar with the original book, I'll explain: 'Jabberwocky' was a poem that Alice read when she first entered the Looking Glass. It's about a little boy that is warned about the Jabberwock (a freakish-looking dragon), the Jubjub bird and 'the frumious Bandersnatch' (also incorrectly portrayed in this movie). It ends with the boy slaying the Jabberwock, and the cheer is ""O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"". 'Jabberwocky' is all of a page long, yet here it's the surrounding plot of the movie! Tim Burton also gets it wrong with the actual characters. None of them are portrayed honestly (Alice's gentle nature comes the closest, but again she's supposed to be a young adult, not some naive child), but the one that stands out the most is how the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts (as played by Helena Bonham Carter) have become the same person. In all fairness, The Red Queen was the one character in the movie that 'got noticed', and Bonham Carter certainly tried. Still, the two characters contradict one another: The Queen's soldiers are red playing cards, yet none of them are Hearts and there are a great deal more than ten; nor are they chess pieces, yet the battlefield is a chess board. Her character is understandably callous, but there's one important detail Burton forgot to research about the Queen of Hearts: While it's true that in the original ""Alice in Wonderland"" novel she constantly yells ""Off with their heads!"", the White Rabbit informs Alice that she never actually beheads anyone (nor does the Red Queen in ""Through the Looking Glass""; she's more of a mischievous know-it-all). This wasn't brought up in the 1951 Disney movie either, but I bring it up here because this bit of trivia makes the Red Queen's bloodthirstiness (particularly the scene with Alice using severed heads as stepping stones through a blood-filled moat to break into the Red Queen's castle) completely moot! This, like many other happenings, was totally inappropriate to include into the body of a children's movie. I don't know how it got a PG rating.<br/><br/>All in all: I didn't outright hate it, but it could have been so much better if Tim Burton had stayed closer to the actual story. I give him credit for unlimited creativity and for avoiding the common mistake of trying to copy the Disney classic, but he really ought to stick to making movies aimed at teenagers and adults. This one is so outlandish and needlessly violent, it might give younger children a case of the frights. I suggest the original 1951 movie (I've never cared much for it, but my nieces love it) or the book for milder illustrations and some relatively harmless frippery."

","This is not the best Tim Burton film yet, but certainly not the worst. I saw this film and had a BIG disappointment in the theaters over the beginning and the ending when she was real. But the film starts out to be TOO much like The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe (2005). And I thought it was the most longest drop in the rabbit hole I've ever seen in Alice in Wonderland movies even when she pounces on that bed. THAT WAS FUNNY!!! This film should be placed into the drama-comedy films, but shouldn't the Top 250s of IMDb movies. I mean, the movie was okay, but still needed to be more general and fantastic as the other Alice in Wonderland moves, I mean, she wouldn't fight and the movies aren't supposed to have thriller and horror in these commercials but they did. POOR Alice. I don't even remember if Alice really got tiny throughout almost start to finish and then big like Attack of the 50 ft. Woman. If this film could just be like that masterpiece, Alice in Wonderland (1985), I would've liked it. But not, it would've been genetic, boring, and unoriginal."

","This movie was good, but not great. I thought Tim Burton could have been more imaginative and creative. I was a little disappointed in the caterpillar because he was so cool in the old Disney show. Like I said, this movie is good, but not great. Great movies leave you begging for more, and this movie doesn't. Sure Johhny Depp looked really cool, but Wonderland should be way more mind blowing. I guess kind of what I think i would see if I ate a mushroom or something. I would have thought Tim Burton would could have been more creative.

"tchockythegreat","6","0","4","9 March 2010"," Lacks the ""muchness"" that could have made it great
","When Lewis Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, I doubt he could have imagined that, over a hundred years after their publication, there would be countless attempts to create a definitive version of his tales in other media, efforts which have ranged from modestly successful to downright awful. Ironically, the strengths of Carroll's novels became the biggest challenges directors have faced when trying to adapt Carroll's work; literary nonsense just doesn't translate well into anything beyond the confines of its own pages, and this fact has more often than not been the doom of most of these attempts at adaptation.<br/><br/>Knowing full well that this is the case, director Tim Burton has taken on the Herculean task of trying to give Carroll's novels a more traditional sense of plot structure and cohesion while at the same time maintaining some semblance of the whimsical spirit of the source material. What has resulted is a version of Alice in Wonderland which isn't an adaptation of Carroll's work, but a re-envisioning, and one that is, like so many versions of Alice before it, only modestly successful at best.<br/><br/>Indeed, under Burton's direction, Alice is no longer a supremely nonsensical story about a bored girl who falls down a rabbit hole and subsequently spends her time wandering in a trippy dimension from bizarre event to bizarre event for no rhyme or reason. It's now a coming of age tale mixed with a bit of female empowerment; not a shock, considering the previous screen writing work of Linda Woolverton (which includes Disney's Mulan and Beauty and the Beast), the scribe of this version of Alice.<br/><br/>Burton's Alice trades Carroll's scatterbrained storytelling for a comparatively straightforward plot in which 19-year-old Alice Kingsley (Mia Wasikowska), a rather unconventional young woman living in Victorian-era England, returns to Underland, a place she once stumbled into when she was six but cannot remember anything about. As it turns out, the inhabitants of Underland have been actively seeking her out for some time in order to fulfill a prophecy in which Alice will save Underland from the tyranny of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).<br/><br/>What bothered me most about the story was not the conventionality of the plot, but how uneven and under-developed many of the characters were. Had this version of Alice featured characters which were a little more fleshed out in terms of motives, personality and their relationships with other characters, then I feel the more unimaginative aspects of the plot line could have been more easily forgiven. For example, the story would have had a bit more dramatic punch had the filmmakers spent more time delineating Alice's past relationships with the inhabitants of Underland. It's made perfectly clear that many of these creatures and people are Alice's friends, even if she initially cannot remember who they are, but why? Why should she care so much about being the savior of these bizarre people? The lack of true inter-personality between Alice and the denizens of Underland only serves to undermine the gravitas of the story. Similarly, one of the more interesting side aspects of the movie was the deep-rooted animosity between the Red Queen and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), which is alluded to briefly at points throughout the movie but never expanded upon enough to give the climax of the movie the weight it should have had.<br/><br/>It seems at times as if Burton was hoping the mere presence and big-screen acumen of cast members such as Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, etc. would make up for the deficiencies of their respective character's scripting. Instead, it only served to allow much of the cast (both live-action and CGI) to drown the movie in scenery-chewing ham, which at times is fun, but does get a bit tiresome after awhile.<br/><br/>Regardless, the film is well-cast, and it is indeed mainly the actors that make this movie watchable. Relative newcomer Mia Wasikowska is probably the best of the live-action characters; she brings a very believable sense of earnestness and determination to Alice. As the swishy Mad Hatter, Johnny Depp is both effectively effervescent and melancholy but seems at times to be channeling Captain Jack Sparrow a little more than he should be. Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen and Crispin Glover's slimy Knave of Hearts are both pretty one-dimensional but, for what it's worth, are still fun to hate. Anne Hathaway is woefully underused as a head-in-the-clouds White Queen; she has some of the best comedic and dramatic moments of the movie in her limited amount of screen time. The voice cast of the CGI characters is top-notch, with Stephen Fry, Matt Lucas, Michael Sheen, and Alan Rickman the standouts.<br/><br/>Burton's vision of Underland, though not as creative as I'd have liked, is still interesting; unlike the lush, vibrant scenery found in much of Pandora in James Cameron's Avatar, there always seems to be a permeating sense of decay in Underland, as if Underland under the Red Queen is a paradise that is slowly but surely sliding into desolation. The 3-D effects are solid and do make the movie more fun to watch, especially when the Cheshire Cat (my favorite character in the movie overall) is on screen.<br/><br/>The movie has many strengths; it's funny at times, it's well-cast, the characters are enjoyable when they're not being excessively overbearing, and it's apparent that a lot of time and effort was put into the production values of the film. But the strengths just barely outweigh the weaknesses, which are a lack of character development, a stubborn reliance on conventionality and style over substance, and a final climatic battle that is both unexciting and painfully uncreativeÂ…and not to mention ends with one of the stupidest and most pointless moments I've ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>To paraphrase the Hatter, Burton's Alice in Wonderland is lacking the ""much-ness"" that could have made it a bit ""mucher"" that it wound up being."
"lafinca","7","0","6","9 March 2010"," This movie is not aimed at children.
","I thoroughly enjoyed Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. This movie is not a remake of the Lewis Carroll story. It is the story of Alice going back to her memories by falling down the rabbit hole once again. She does not go there to explore the wonders of childhood as she did the first time. She goes to find the adult Alice. Enjoyment is heightened if one has read the book.<br/><br/>This movie is not a fable for children, but an introspective for teens and adults. Honestly, as a former teacher, I would recommend that children under 12 not go to this movie because it may frighten them, or they will not understand it. However, I highly recommend it to teenagers and adults. If the viewers not only watch the movie but listen carefully, they should enjoy a marvelous visual and intellectual ride."
"theblacksuit3","6","0","4","8 March 2010"," Alice has returned
","Alice has returned to Wonderland to defeat a dragon that she believes to not be real while everyone else also thinks shes not really Alice. The story isn't what we would have hoped for, but it is still pretty solid, it just wasn't portrayed very well. Ironically, the only acting i was unsatisfied was Wasikowska's. She was a very flat actress, and didn't really put much emotion into it. I'm surprised that she got the part over someone else who I'm sure could have done better.<br/><br/>I loved the characters of the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. The actors brought so much to the characters. My only problem with Johnny Depp in this movie is that he changed his accent like, 3 times. He should have just stuck with one voice. It may have been purposely used to portray his split personality, but it seemed distracting. Stephen Fry as the Cat was amazing, the voice went really well, and the cat himself looked very strange and creepy and amazing. With the Red Queen, the look annoyed me, but the performance by Carter was amazing as well.<br/><br/>The visual effects were phenomenal, just like we all expected. The story seemed flat, the movie seemed short, and the Jaberwock battle short as well. If the Jaberwock was so great, he would have put up a better fight before Alice totaled his ass. And Christopher Lee only had two lines, he has the coolest voice in the world, and his lines gets cut into two.<br/><br/>I liked it, and will probably get the DVD, but I still believe that Tim could have done better with a project like this."

So this became my must watch film since then.<br/><br/>So, obviously I had huge expectations. Did the film meet them?

"greenylennon","7","0","4","6 March 2010"," Alice? Yes, passed conditionally
","I had been waiting for this film since his first announcement in 2008, so it was natural that I expected a lot from Tim Burton and the remaining crew, after the wonderful Sweeney Todd and the insuperable Big Fish, which for me is the best Tim Burton work so far. Failing to mention that I was very disappointed in finding out my running-wild myopia doesn't allow me to see 3D films (I still have trouble with my sight, and I came back from cinema one hour ago), I think the visuals are a delight, surely worth of the definition ""Wonderland"": tortuous trees, garish flowers, Cheshire Cat and Blue Caterpillar better than Disney's, disproportionate queens and fantastic architectures, the crew couldn't do a better work, not to mention the costumes, the cinematography and the casting - although I didn't like the soundtrack and the score. Mia Wasikowska is a good breakthrough for the film, Anne Hathaway had a role that had a high risk of over-acting and ridiculousness, which she pulled off quite well, and Burton-darlings Depp and Bonham Carter were perfect as usual. But, but... there's something I didn't quite like. I often had the impression this was a film on commission, not generated by the filmmaker's own creativity and desire to produce a new work, and that's why ""Alice"" lacked a lot of the poetry present in so many Burton films, the mostly loved factor, I think, of his production. I couldn't feel any true inspiration here, and it was a kind of letdown, because, if only it featured a tiny bit of inspiration, it could be a masterpiece remembered in years. I'm afraid ""Alice"" will remain only a minor movie in Tim Burton's filmography, and it will be mainly quoted for its outer beauty. I'm sorry I'm giving a Tim Burton's film a 7, but I think this is the rightest vote, considering the reasons I previously tried to analyze."
"bajgone","6","0","6","6 March 2010"," Ironically, it never feels real
","I would say Alice in Wonderland is a moderate disappointment. First of all, the storyline is rushed, you never get the chance to reflect on what's happening before the journey is over.<br/><br/>CGI, possibly the most critical element of the entire production, is beautiful from artistic point of view but unconvincing and artificial as an existing world, which is a major let down. Blandly put, it looks great only as a wallpaper. Technically it is at least two classes below Avatar (and the budget was somewhere around 150mln!), especially when you take in account rather mediocre use of 3D. <br/><br/>Acting is mixed - definitely the Red Queen is the brightest spot here, although Depp still manages to deliver at his usual level. Unfortunately the central figure - Alice herself - is a major miscast. Her performance seems flat and bored. Furthermore, she doesn't handle the pure green box scenes in a way that more experienced and talented actors do.<br/><br/>Overall, if you feel compelled to see it, save some money and don't go to 3D screenings.<br/><br/>Strong 6\10"
"rubenvanbergen","5","0","6","6 March 2010"," Lacks excitement
","There is really only one thing wrong with this movie. If this were a minor thing, I would have given it 10 stars anyway. Unfortunately, it isn't minor at all: it's the story.<br/><br/>I guess the root of the problem is in the original story by Caroll. A classic, to be sure, and a delight to read, but it lacks a strong plot. It is ultimately just an erratic sequence of amusing events. And of course that's the whole point. The randomness is what people enjoy about Alice in Wonderland.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's movie, however, tries to insert a plot through the introduction of an ultimate goal for Alice which is revealed quite early on. But a true plot never emerges. Sure, Alice has to run away several times and makes a narrow escape once, but there is never any real tension; any ""rising action"" or conflict. At the same time, because of the time constraints a movie inevitably faces, there is very little occasion for the humour and wit found in the books. What results is a tepid middle-road which is not quite adventure, not quite fantasy, not quite ""literary nonsense"". Not really boring either, but certainly not very exciting. With, as a semi-climax, a battle of which the outcome is known in advance.<br/><br/>A lot is made up for by the visual spectacle and the all-star cast, although the lack of a good script gives them and their characters little opportunity to shine. There are a few laughs to be had and all in all it's pretty good fun to watch. And perhaps a lot of the disappointment comes from the expectations set so high by the director, the original and the promising names of Depp, Fry, Rickman, etc. Still, Alice in Wonderland is not what it could have been, not what it should have been."

I expected the same or more, Johnny Depp's performance well, he did a normal role. It was the script I felt it didn't follow the original's feel. Even though it was the 3D version, the trailers were more exciting than the movie. The mad hatter in the original version is still my favorite. It was an OK movie.

"imnotinsane1","4","0","4","5 March 2010"," Alternative Title: ""Alice in what she always called Wonderland but is actually called Underland but the title says Wonderland because it's marketing gold""
","""Alice in Wonderland"". Surely everyone knows what it is. The story of a girl who goes into the strangest and most surreal visions for a Children's story. Whilst it's intentionally said to be a ""nonsense"" story (you don't get genres like that anymore, do you?), it's considered a classic. Thus, many adaptations have been made and the story and it's characters and sheer scale of surreality is more influential today in the late 2000's-early 2010's than it's ever been. <br/><br/>So, how's does getting one of the great artistic film visionaries of the late 20th Century, early 21st to resurrect and re-imagine the story for a new generation on an epic, big-budget scale with a high-calibre cast sound? Sounds like a pretty sweet investment. After all, this is Tim Burton we're talking about, the creator of ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Big Fish"" to name a few (of the best he's done at least). So now it's finally out, and did he succeed to really breathe new life into this highly-influential world and make it enjoyable to all? Yes and...not really.<br/><br/>I could talk about this movie a lot and point out every single little detail on what I thought of the movie, but I'll try and summarise without spoilers as best as I can. Positives first: The overall artistic design, character design, special effects and overall direction of the movie were for the most part, excellent. Tim Burton certainly has a penchant for bringing his visions and bizarre artistic interpretations of things right to the screen and it's usually an awe to see and it's definitely the case with this movie also. And the beginning and ending period-esquire ""real-life"" scenes are surprisingly well done too, never thought Burton can go period and get it done really well! Casting, on the most part, is really fantastic too. People would be pessimistic over Johnny Depp being the Mad Hatter, but he pulls off a good performance anyway. Not Depp's best, but certainly not his worst. The best casting in the whole movie however was without a doubt Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. My god, what an incredibly fun portrayal of the character she's brought to the screen and bar none one of the best villain characters of the past year thanks to Carter's performance. Anne Hathaway was also shockingly good as the White Queen, with an ultra-impressive British accent and a delicate, mysterious performance combining Nigella Lawson with a pure Disney Princess character, in a good way. Which brings me to my next positive, the existing characters are portrayed mostly to justice and sometimes even beyond that and whilst not all of the additional characters are particularly stand-out, those that are good are certainly great additions.<br/><br/>Now, the negatives: The story is a weird experience to get used to, not the good kind of weird neither. Not all of the story is bad, there are a lot of good scenes and some new additions and features are enjoyable too, but some of these shifts from the original story's narrative causes the story for some who already know the story to feel really, really slow in places. Unnecessary for a place like Wonderland which is originally brimming with whimsy and gleeful weirdness. Oh I'm sorry, ""Underland"" apparently. And whilst I did say that most of the character were very good, original or not, there are also some that are frighteningly generic. I could go on about these types of characters but I'm probably almost at 1,000 words already so I'll just say that one really frighteningly generic character shouldn't of been so prominent in the story, yet he is in the first quarter of the movie. <br/><br/>Alright, so in summary: Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" is worth going to see, if you can get through the movie's much slower moments and the differences in story to the original, granted if the original really did have much of a plot anyway.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"trixxychrissy","Null","0","5","5 March 2010"," Enough beauty and strangeness to compensate for a missing storyline
","I went to the theater to see this movie in 3D with no expectations other than to be at least mildly entertained for its duration and to enjoy the effect of having teacups thrown at my face. I'm pleased to say that my expectations were exactly on par with what the movie provided. The movie's beginning scene had me doubting whether or not the ticket was worth the gap in my wallet however. Alice finds herself in a situation that I'm fairly sure hundreds of other heroines have also had to work there way out of...that of the uppity aristocratic arranged marriage. In this scene we are introduced to Alice's various relatives including the sadly, easily forgettable Aunt Imogen who could have had all the makings of deep and interesting character but was written off cheaply as more of a crazy cat lady and less of a estranged spinster with motives, past, and a reflective relationship with Alice. This is especially true based on the concept which is essentially the core concept of the movie, that the most interesting people are also insane. <br/><br/>It's a painfully typical situation. A young girl with an unusually independent mind finds herself suffocating in the thin air of pompousness and propriety. She shows all the signs of being a free thinker but somehow is not able to make major decisions for herself. As soon as she takes the plunge down the rabbit hole however it's a totally different movie. She is immediately introduced to some of the primary denizens of the Anti-Red Queen Wonderland population and just as rapidly ripped apart from them. The question that's repeated again and again is ""is this the real Alice?"" forcing Alice to make efforts to consider that herself more and more as the film progresses but only in a very minor way. <br/><br/>The behaviorisms of Alice were a much needed departure from the typical fluffy whimsy of fantasy protagonists. She comes off as a much stronger character than simply running around awe struck for the entirety of the movie which was what I had come to expect from this genre. She believes that she is in a dream and ultimately has complete control although her environment works to prove her theory wrong every in nearly every scene. Her mild reactions may seem out of place but make sense in the larger picture. Not only is Alice following along a set prophetic course but she is also reinventing portions of a dream she's already had. Things in wonderland are therefore less surprising as they are merely curious. <br/><br/>Another performance to note was oddly enough Anne Hathaway's. I'm not a Hathaway fan but this performance gave me much more respect for her acting chops. She is exquisitely graceful like you might expect from a White Queen but manages to juxtapose nearly sickening sweetness with a strangeness that forces you to question her motives along the way. Even her gracefulness is displayed in such a manner as to question its authenticity. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the Mad Hatter was everything I had hoped it wouldn't be. Basically a random amalgamation of Braveheart and Jack Sparrow. He does manage to make the character childlike and awkward in one scene and just as easily menacing and foreign in another which in certain scenes became slightly annoying but in others had a very powerful affect depending on the atmosphere. Essentially this character fell somewhere between not crazy enough and confusingly strange which for the most part felt a little unsatisfying.<br/><br/>The movie trots along at a decent pace with some eerie elements along the way such as floating heads in the moat surrounding the Red Queen's castle. Helena Bohnam does an exceptional job as the Red Queen and manages to make a self centered psychopath into a sympathetic character every now and again which helps to alleviate some of the static from Alice's character non-progression. She works excellently as Hathaway's opposite. Both Queen's leave you wondering if they really are as good or as evil as they are trying to make you believe. The ending is everything you can assume it will be and nothing more. Overall I don't regret seeing it although it is worth mentioning that the 3D effect probably weren't really worth the three extra dollars I paid. If I do watch this again in the future I'll be happy to enjoy the gorgeous visuals in HD and won't greatly miss the overall ineffectual 3D attempt."
