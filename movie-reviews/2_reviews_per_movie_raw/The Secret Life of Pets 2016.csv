","After hearing people praise this movie, and seeing how much it was advertised, I was curious to see this. Now, I've never loved Illumination's movies, but I've never hated them either. I don't mind any of their films, but I feel like they're not as innovative as certain other animation companies. Hearing how much people loved Secret Life of Pets gave me a bit of hope that perhaps this movie would be Illumination's breakthrough. The one that would have the best animation, story, characters, emotions, etc.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Secret Life of Pets just ended up being another okay movie for me. Right when I saw the trailers, I was reminded of Toy Story with the plot. I feared that the plot would be predictable, and it definitely was. A few different things were thrown in, but as a whole, the story was pretty predictable. One of the different things that was thrown in had potential to be a really emotional scene. This is a spoiler, by the way. Anyway, Duke finds out that his original owner had died, which could've led into an emotional scene, like in Finding Dory when Dory was made to believe her parents were dead. But the whole scene failed. Firstly, it was told, not shown. A random cat just gives the news to Duke. Second, Duke barely reacts to this, despite the movie going out of its way to show us a montage of him with his owner. He just gets mad at the family that moved into the owner's home before getting caught by animal control. After that, it's never mentioned again. Duke is just fine with his owner being dead, and living with a new owner and Max. This really bothers me, since as I said, this scene had potential to be emotionally provoking. But it didn't take the chance.<br/><br/>Our main characters didn't interest me. Max is just another typical good guy that just wants a good life. Duke was just another lovable big guy who may be a bit slow. However, the only characters that made me laugh/I enjoyed were Gidget, Snowball, Tiberius, and Pops. Gidget and Snowball were the ones that really shined, though. Gidget was just plain adorable, and hilarious. As for Snowball, I'm not a big fan of Kevin Hart, but he really did a great job for his first animated film. I personally prefer him doing voice work than him in live action films. He managed to make me laugh multiple times as Snowball. That bunny may be cute, but he's totally psychotic. As for the rest of the characters, they didn't really interest me. I don't hate any of them, but they were pretty generic.<br/><br/>I also am sick of the Minions. They got old when their own movie was made. I won't mind seeing them in Despicable Me 3, since we'll only get small doses of them, but having them constantly shoved in our faces is getting annoying. The short that came on before Secret Life of Pets was just stupid. No experimentation with the animation or characters. Just plain stupidity. They also had one of the dogs in Secret Life wear a Minions costume, and I just rolled my eyes. Minions may make Illumination money, but not many people care about them anymore. I certainly don't.<br/><br/>I do have some positive things to say about this film. The animation was impressive. I was particularly impressed with how they animated water, and the mannerisms of the pets. Which leads into the next thing I liked about this. I admire how much the creators of the film did their research on not just dogs, but most pets people keep. They were spot on with how dogs, cats, birds, etc. act. As a dog and cat owner, I appreciate the humor/realism that went into the pets, and they reminded me of my own pets.<br/><br/>As a whole, this a cute, but flawed film. I wasn't impressed with most of the characters. The story was predictable. Nothing about this film was thought or emotionally provoking. However, I appreciated some of the film's humor, animation, and the research that went into the mannerisms of the pets. It's a shame that this wasn't Illumination's breakthrough. Sure, it's making a lot of money, but it's still just an alright movie. Hopefully one day, Illumination will make a film just as great as the likes of Zootopia or Inside Out. The Secret Life of Pets just isn't that film."

","Animated film that takes place in NYC. Two dogs named Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) and Duke (voiced by Eric Stonestreet) get separated from their owner when out for a walk. The film chronicles their journey back home.<br/><br/>This is clearly aimed at kids but has plenty of humor that adults will enjoy. I'm in my 50s and laughed long and loud at some of the antics. The script is good and moves quickly. I was never bored. With one exception the voices perfectly fit the characters. The one exception was Snowball. He's a psychotic rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. Hart can be funny but not here. He YELLS every word out at the audience. It gets annoying quick. The animation is great--very fluid and pleasing to the eye. The backdrops of NYC are breath-taking. The only real debit is there are some glaring lapses in logic but it IS a kids film. Recommended."

","When you see as many movies as I do (and you start writing reviews in your head while you're watching them), certain movies, parts of movies, plot points or characters remind you of other movies. In my reviews, I often note those parallels, using them to comment on the movie I'm reviewing. Sometimes I note similarities between movies to say that the more recent film is unoriginal. Other times, it's just to help explain what the new movie is like. The animated adventure comedy ""The Secret Life of Pets"" (PG, 1:30) reminds me very much of two other animated features but that's not necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>Tell me if this sounds familiar: Someone's possessions (as he or she views them) actually have secret lives of their own which are only really apparent when the owner is not around. These anthropomorphic possessions relate to each other and form friendships. When a newer version of the original is brought into the group, jealousy emerges and the original tries to get rid of the interloper. This struggle results in both of the rivals being thrust out of the comforts of home into the little-understood big, bad world, a situation which requires their compadres to venture out of their own comfort zones to mount a rescue.<br/><br/>That set-up fits Illumination Entertainment's 2016 ""The Secret Life of Pets"" as well as it does the 1995 Pixar/Disney classic film ""Toy Story"". (Think, ""Pet Story"", or ""The Secret Life of Toys"".) But considering that the 2016 film is about animals rather than toys, maybe the better comparison is to another 2016 animated feature (also from Disney) by the name of ""Zootopia"". In both of those 2016 films, a couple of anthropomorphic animals (among many others living in a big city) form a partnership which develops into a mutually beneficial friendship. I guess it's not unfair to think of ""The Secret Life of Pets"" as a mash-up of ""Toy Story"" and ""Zootopia"". Nevertheless, this one charts its own unique course and is as entertaining as those other two or the ""Despicable Me"" films, also from Illumination Entertainment.<br/><br/>Now that you know what ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is LIKE, here's what it's ABOUT: The movie focuses on a small brown and white terrier named Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) and his relationship with the other pets in his apartment building. Max lives in a small Manhattan apartment with his owner, a young woman named Katie (Ellie Kemper). When Katie goes to work each day, Max sits at the door wondering where she has gone and waiting for her to come back and play with him. Meanwhile, the pets in the building across the alley and above and below his apartment (and one guniea pig lost in the air ducts) are more active in their daily lives (and more mobile) than is readily apparent. (Thus, the title of the film.) Some of the neighborhood pets include an overweight white cat named Chloe (Lake Bell), a bulldog named Mel (Bobby Moynihan), a dachshund named Buddy (Hannibal Buress), a canary named Sweet Pea (Tara Strong), and Gidget (Jenny Slate), a white Pomeranian who has a secret crush on Max.<br/><br/>Except for missing Katie during the day, all is well in Max's little world until one not-so-fine day when Katie brings home another dog she rescued from a shelter. Duke (Eric Stonestreet) is a large, shaggy, dark brown dog who has no problem throwing his weight around to get the best place to sleep, or as much food as he wants, or anything else. Max starts scheming about how to get rid of Duke, but one such attempt while they're in the park with Katie's dog walker back-fires and sets both Max and Duke off on a wild and dangerous journey around the city. When Gidget realizes that Max has disappeared, she enlists their mutual pet friends, plus a caged hawk named Tiberius (Albert Brooks), and a few other neighborhood pets (including the Dana Carvey voiced ""Pops""), to help her find Max. Meanwhile, Max and Duke have to try escaping from animal control workers, a disfigured alley cat named Ozone (Steve Coogan) and a small, but crazed and bitter bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart), who was discarded by the magician he worked for and now leads a sewer-dwelling group of radicals called The Flushed Pets, who are bent on wiping out all the humans – and who decide that Max and Duke are also their enemies.<br/><br/>""The Secret Life of Pets"" is every bit as entertaining as you'd hope, based on its theatrical trailers, or its movie posters, or just its title. Co-writers Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch exploit many of the well-known quirks of different kinds of pets, but give each character in the film its own personality. Then, once the script clearly establishes who each of these characters are, it gives them plenty to do, but without making the story unnecessarily complicated. Co-directors Chris Renaud (who also voices the aforementioned lost guinea pig) and Yarrow Cheney bring this promising concept and excellent script to realization by keeping the plot moving and not overdoing any of the film's big ideas or overplaying any of the gags. Finally, with the film's impressive voice cast and the filmmakers' ""Despicable"" history, the performances and the visuals are excellent across the board. On the critical side, I found a subplot involving Duke's backstory and a ""Grease""-inspired sausage-fueled dream sequence to be odd and unnecessary diversions, and I would've liked to see just a little more originality and inspiration sprinkled throughout the movie. However, there's no denying that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is very well-done good, clean fun for the whole family. ""A-"""
"meganhinge","4","67","109","7 October 2016"," The best bits are all in the trailer
","The trailer was looking promising. Lots of laughs and clever humour. Hopes were high as the trailer for Zootopia was inciting and that film did not disappoint. However, Secret Life of Pets turned out to be a fizzer. Excessively violent for a children's film, not funny or clever and really rather odd. The characters are not developed which means that the audience doesn't particularly care what happens on their quest. The stand out of the film is the husky little white fluffball of a dog. I think this film is aimed at children, though the guy down the row from me was certainly laughing a lot (while I was taking power naps). Not the same caliber as Despicable Me."
"seancassidy-32550","8","23","34","3 July 2016"," A fun movie with a good plot.
","I enjoyed this movie more than Despicable Me. I liked the fact that there was more than one story going on at a time. At one point, there were three different stories that eventually came together.<br/><br/>I think the jokes in the movie would be funnier for adults than children, probably because I'm a fan of Louis C.K. and his delivery. I think the eventual happy ending that concludes the movie is suited to the kids and they will come out happy they saw it.<br/><br/>The characters aren't as compelling as Disney/Pixar characters but I think there were more jokes in this one than usual. I also don't think there were as much emotional obstacles for the characters to conquer in this one opposed to a Disney/Pixar movie. This movie was just fun almost all the way through. Even when the characters were about to die they were still making jokes. Some people might rather this type of animation.<br/><br/>The movie was easy and fun to watch, a good movie for the kids and the adults."
"rgkarim","8","20","30","9 July 2016"," Pets on the Run, Make for Silly, Family Fun
","Kids movies continue to swarm into the theaters, and Hollywood's trailer editors have been hard at work baiting us in. With Disney owning the box office this summer, Illumination Entertainment (the creators of Despicable Me) are taking a shot at the box office run. This weekend we got The Secret Life Of Pets, a movie that has been highly anticipated since it's trailer debut from so long ago. It was indeed a very entertaining trailer, but we all know how trailers can be deceptive now don't we? So I have headed into the trenches again to report on the latest film to hit the silver screen. <br/><br/>The GOOD  Cute/Kid Friendly  Funny  Good animation<br/><br/>When you watch, or for many rewatch, the trailers you most likely saw the characters as cute, cuddly animals doing hilarious things. Good news! The trailer is accurate this time and provides the cute factor you expected (including the very scenes you saw in the trailer). All of the characters are adorable, the main ones being bouncy, fluffy, high-spirited animals that will make you want to say Awwwwww. Our design team found a way to maximize all the cute features of an animal and sell it to the families that will lead to merchandising. Even animals you wouldn't think cute (like snakes, gators, and lizards) get the cuddly personifications. Hopefully you have gathered from this, that the design is kid friendly and will have your little ones enamored. <br/><br/>But cute is only the hook, what keeps the interest going in this film? The answer is the comedy of course. The stunts the animals pull are entertaining and the dialogue itself had me chuckling at many of the media references. Voice acting only helps sell the comedy more, especially Kevin Hart and all his high pitched screaming. Your kids though will be the ones to enjoy the comedy the most though, as it is slapstick, simplistic antics with digital pets. Running into walls, making funny faces, or going to the bathroom on the floor are just some of the things you will see that had toddlers chuckling in their seats. <br/><br/>And a small bonus, that really shouldn't be a surprise, is that the animation is good. Illumination Entertainment certainly has their anatomy and physiology down being able to superimpose human qualities while still maintaining there animal qualities. Glad to know that our animation studios are still able to produce great works. If only they could have put that effort into the next few qualities. <br/><br/>THE BAD  The Story  Lack of Uniqueness  Trailers showed you a lot of the movie<br/><br/>With the comedy and animation being the obvious focus, you have to wonder how the story fared in this movie. Unfortunatelyit didn't fare that well. Oh it's not that bad at all, but the problem is that it lacks anything memorable or emotionally driving for me. The writers crammed a lot of plots into a short 90 minutes run time, and the resulting production was a very rushed, shallow tale with little development. A split focus resulted in little emotional build-up, and there was no intriguing qualities to keep my attention on any of the cast. And the goal they were trying to achieve was very limited and didn't really set any time limit or urgency to the tale. <br/><br/>To add more fuel to that fire, The Secret Life of Pets wasn't really that unique of a movie. We've had talking pet movies before, where anthropomorphic animals traverse a city or town that often involves a very extreme villain (think Oliver and Company or Homeward Bound). Those tales stick home because they had edge, depth, and moments that stick out in your mind. Not the case with this movie, as again there was no drive to make our pets grow, develop, or even go through much struggle at all. It doesn't have any twists to mix things up either, and therefore leaves little to spoilt. In addition, much of the movie, including a lot of the funny parts, is revealed in the three trailers out and therefore you can save yourself some major bucks by just rewatching all of the trailers. Yeah, I know that is definitely a disappointing factor. <br/><br/>The Verdict<br/><br/>The Secret Life Of Pets is exactly what the trailer promises, fun, entertaining, and wildly adorable. Younger audience members, as well as those very young at heart, are the target group for this movie hands down. It has the laugh factor certainly, and the cast of characters are a motley crew that I certainly enjoyed. However, the story is very simplistic, the lack of emotional suspense, and that much of the movie is told in the trailers make this movie not the most memorable of the summer. I can't say it is worth a trip to the theater in comparison to some of the other kid movies, but it makes for a good family outing. <br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Animation/Comedy/Family: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"
"valen060","9","34","55","3 August 2016"," Surprisingly Entertaining Illumination Flick
","Ever since the release of Despicable Me back in 2010, Illumination has really stepped up from their previous animated movies. Whether it be the aforementioned film, its sequel, its spin-off Minions, or the 2012 adaptation of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, it was quite a change with their latest entry The Secret Life of Pets.<br/><br/>The plot centers around Max (Louis C.K.), a terrier living happily with his loving owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) in New York City, but when she adopts a bigger dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) to live with them, Max is overwhelmed by his new roommate. The two opposing dogs must then work together however, before Katie gets back when they are lost in the big city.<br/><br/>For an original story done by Illumination, it does creatively borrow off the concepts of both Toy Story as well as the 2008 film Bolt, yet it flows out well with the voice cast bringing these characters to life which include stand-up comic Louis C.K. voicing the leading dog Max, Jenny Slate (Saturday Night Live, Zootopia) as Max's potential love interest Gidget, and 'Modern Family' star Eric Stonestreet as Duke. With quick-witted, slapstick humor that feels reminiscent of Looney Tunes (even with a tendency to adlib lines in some scenes), the real scene stealer among this talented cast goes to comedian Kevin Hart voicing adorable, yet antagonistic rabbit Snowball.<br/><br/>While the littler ones will be kept engaged and entertained by the humorous animal characters as well as the obstacles they come across, to me personally the story feels rushed, especially the need for a little more emotional depth and better character development. I know there's a lot more to offer in this story's universe, so a sequel can't be far behind from this underrated animated flick. Nevertheless, it certainly kept me laughing nearly throughout the movie's 90-minute run time and it's something that shouldn't be taken for granted. I enjoyed it."

"Horst_In_Translation","4","32","53","11 September 2016"," Some fun moments, but ultimately not a good watch overall due to the lack of a plot really
","""The Secret Life of Pets"" is one of the most known animated films from the United States this year (2016). The two directors and four writers who made this include a couple names that worked on films from the Minions universe, so nobody should be surprised that a Minions short film runs before ""Pets"" and there is also another reference at the very end with one of the pets being dressed like a Minion. But back to this one here. I was as unimpressed by the outcome here as I was by the newest ""Minions"" movie. The film runs for approximately 90 minutes and gives us an insight into the life of pets and what they do when their owners are off to work and not in charge. Heard that before? That's right. The general idea here reminded me a lot of the Toy Story approach to things. And there are more references. For example, the two main characters (dogs) felt a lot like the protagonists from the ""Monsters Inc."" universe in terms of their size and interactions. So yeah, ""Pets"" definitely borrows a lot from other films, but what is the most disappointing thing is that it tries to be creative in its own right at times, but almost never succeeds and this is pretty shocking looking at how many filmmakers worked on this one.<br/><br/>""Pets"" is definitely not a failure and there are several parts where I enjoyed it from the comedic perspective. I also liked some minor references, for example early on about how the main character does not like to be alone at home. The comedy is not the problem here. It is the emotional impact. The only part where it is close to making one is when we find out about the new dog's owner and his journey back to his old owner's house. Other than that, the drama is entirely forgettable and good animation is just not enough anymore today on the level of Pixar quality. There are many flaws with the story in here. First of all, the makers threw in character after character without really elaborating on any of them. Honestly, counting all the (lost) pets, there are enough characters for three films in here. Another problem is their behavior. It felt a bit strange how they quickly stepped in for each other out of nowhere when moments before we still felt that they did not like each other at all and this refers to the two dogs as well as the fluffy white rabbit who turns out the main antagonist. We see all the time how evil and cold-hearted he is and then out of nowhere he risks his life for his enemies basically.<br/><br/>Another big problem I had with the film is that I had no idea what the characters' goals were throughout the film, at least for the two dogs. Enjoy a day out? Run from the lost pets? Run from the dog-catcher? They were just out there and it really had no purpose and then in the end they return home safely and it's all good with everybody being friends with everybody. I was not convinced at all. Also about the love interest of the main character, there was contradictory behavior. On one occasion she acts as if she wants nobody to know who she has a crush on and then she screams it out to everybody. It was pretty bizarre and the writing really lacked a lot on some occasions. This is also why my overall verdict for the film is negative. I give it a thumbs-down and if they ever make a sequel I must say I have very little interest in seeing it as this film was quite a disappointment and for me personally, it is nowhere near being a contender for best animated film of 2016, even with all the known voice actors in the German as well as English version. Not even for Louis C.K., everyone can be a winner."

","I saw the trailer for this movie last Summer and the first thing I said was ""I have to go see this movie."" So, needless to say I've been looking forward to this film since last summer and I had very high expectations for it. I am pleased to say it went above and beyond and met these expectations, I absolutely adored this movie and would recommend it to anybody of any age. <br/><br/>First things first is starting from the beginning and the introduction of the characters and I thought Illumination Entertainment did a fantastic job in presenting each individual. As an audience we knew after the first ten minutes who each character was, their relationships with each other, and the individual personalities. For an animation film I was really pleased with this because you normally don't get that character depth in the beginning and sometimes you never get it in the film. As the story went on the characters developed at an individual level as well as a relationship level with others which added to the plot line drastically. Not to mention the actors and actresses who portrayed each character were spot on with the voices. <br/><br/>However, the icing on the cake for the entire film for me was the soundtrack. The soundtrack is very important because it not only sets the pace for the film on screen but it also changes your emotions and tells you when you need to be sad, scared, happy, etc. That is exactly what this soundtrack did and it pleased me because without that human interaction happening on the screen, because it was animated, the music filled that gap and allowed your emotions to change. <br/><br/>One problem I did have with the movie, and this was more towards the end, was the humor. The humor made me laugh in the beginning quite a bit but by the end of the movie the humor was starting to become more outrageous. Almost as if they were trying to hard to make it funny. Now even though this humor was changing a bit as the film went on it was not enough for me not to suggest seeing this movie for its laugh value. <br/><br/>Overall, if you have a family, kids, husband, or just want to see this movie with friends I would definitely recommend. You'll laugh, you'll cry a little bit, but most importantly you will leave the theater happy."

","26 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight. - The Secret Life of Pets. Max is the spoiled only dog belonging to Katie. His whole world revolves round her and when she brings Duke home from the pound, Max is more than a little miffed. Duke and Max fall out but are forced to help each other when they get lost and into many scrapes during the course of their day. This film, although not side splittingly funny was very amusing and the film makers are so very clever in creating a personality for each and every one of the animals in this film. I think we secretly all hope our pets have fun lives when we leave them home alone, and this film very cleverly moulds each pet to its owner and each house to fit it's pet. Applause must be given to the animators, the details which have been created in the cityscape is incredible, take time to look behind the animals for the skylines, the water, ever the sewers have so much crammed in to them I think you would need to see the film several time to take it all in, it's a long way from ink and paint!!!!"
"bkrauser-81-311064","6","33","58","20 July 2016"," Flavorless but You Could Do Worse
","I start this review by first acknowledging there's nothing wrong with this film from a family-oriented entertainment point of view. It's colorful, it's fun at times, provides a positive message about acceptance and provides a clever enough high concept to keep the kids on their keesters for 80 minutes. As a rudimentary children's film, you certainly can do worse.<br/><br/>The problem with The Secret Lives of Pets stems from its complete inability to marry story, character and concept into a discernible package. As it stands, the film is rushed, bulky and is chalked full of nonsensical choices that cripples any verdant ideas that could have been. It's a first draft; not a final product.<br/><br/>The story begins with a happy Jack Russell Terrier named Max (C.K.) who lives with his owner Katie (Kemper) in a surprisingly roomy Manhattan apartment. Things change drastically and suddenly with the arrival of Duke (Stonestreet) a large, shaggy Newfoundland whose introduced as a ""new brother"" to Max's chagrin. They, of course don't get along and after a series of confrontations find themselves lost. The first to notice they're missing is a lovestruck Pomeranian named Gidget (Slate) who recruits the rest of Max's friends among others to recover them from the vast streets of New York City.<br/><br/>The rest of Max's friends are barely worth mentioning as they're mostly utilized to push the buttons and pull the levers on some uninspired comedic set-pieces. They're not really useful to the plot, nor do they succeed in being the Toy Story (1995)-inspired resilient and diverse gaggle the movie hopes they are. Part of the reason for this is none of the side characters actually solve any problems. They jet here, they jet there but when faced with any obstacles they just seem to rush it. Gone is the creativity of having Mr. Potato Head fashion a new body out of a tortilla; now we have elderly Basset Hound, Pops (Carvey) hobbling through construction sites with stalwart confidence.<br/><br/>Frankly focusing on the story's tagged-on villains might have paid more dividends. The broad machinations of Snowball (Hart), a bunny with delusions of grandeur are easily the best part of the film, even if they remain painfully underdeveloped. Additionally his ""Flushed Pets"" group could have complicated Duke's allegiance to his new owner or more easily pegged Max as a fully socialized pet and therefore in need of re-education. Snowball was the best chance the movie had in getting audiences to truly know the characters we're supposed to be rooting for but instead they blew it on prolonged chase sequences and a sausage factory bit that goes absolutely nowhere.<br/><br/>And that gets me to the biggest problem I have with this film; the creators' approach to the high concept itself. The film tries to have its cake and eat it to, portraying characters with innately human characteristics but still clinging to the charming pet-like idiosyncrasies we know and love about our furry friends. For example, Gidget recruits the help of Tiberius (Brooks) a hawk who at first tries to eat her. She barely escapes his talons only to trust him once more because that's just what a peppy little dog would do. Max's friends Mel (Moynihan) and Buddy (Buress) don't even notice Max is gone because, being dogs, they're distracted by butterflies and squirrels. They're certainly not a rag-tag group of lovable rogues, they're a confederacy of dunces, successful only because of the ever changing allegiances of the main antagonist. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention Snowball at one point joins forces with Max to save Duke in a climactic sequence so blithely unnatural it renders the friends search and rescue completely moot.<br/><br/>This film is a rushed, characterless, flavorless kids film that just barely stretches its plot over the skeleton of its story structure. As I said before, if all you're looking for is a bland and forgettable family film, you could do worse. Yet provided it's appealing concept, you'd really think the animation studio that made Despicable Me (2010) could do better."

But whatever, free movie and yummy popcorn right? <br/><br/>To say the least, this movie took me off guard and laughed so much at the roles the characters had. It was such an adorable movie. Even though it was a kids movie, it had clues here and there about things adults would do and even say. Which made it even funnier! I couldn't give a bad review on this because I genuinely had a great time watching it.

With fun music by Alexandre Desalt (The Danish Girl 2015), a list of Who's Who cool VO actors (Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Dana Carey, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell - the list goes on), and realistic animation courtesy of Illumination Entertainment, new, old and foreseeable pet owners (young and mature) will find great delight in this easy and entertaining to watch animation production. To the credit of the writers, all the obvious ""pet jokes/mannerisms"" and current society references aren't forced on the viewer at one time. Thus, the film keeps giving throughout. Sure, about 3/4 the way in the idea grows a bit old, but the cuteness factor quickly returns for a rewarding finish.

","I'm surprised this film got such a low overall score by users. I thought is was a blast. I am not an animated movie fan in the least. I normally like dark movies, dramas, sci-fi, and horror. This was the first animated film I have seen since Avatar, (which isn't the same type of animation really,) but when I watched the trailer last year, I thought it would probably be good. And it was.<br/><br/>The movie delivered exactly what it promised: laughs. It's not earth shattering, mind blowing, and it doesn't explain the meaning of life in 90 minutes. But it's not that type of movie. It's a summer escape film, one that is a little different from the 1000th superhero movie or Sequel #10 of The Current Film of Mediocrity, and one that you can bring your children to without worrying about covering their eyes and ears every scene. There are a couple of scenes of mild violence or almost violence, but they aren't any worse than Bugs Bunny and his adventures with the Roadrunner (I suppose that reference dates me lol). <br/><br/>What I liked the best about the movie is the way it demonstrates the thoughts and behaviors of the pets to the viewer. As a Great Dane owner, I often wonder what my dogs are thinking/doing, especially when I'm at work, and my ideas are similar to the writers. Their thoughts and conversations were the funniest parts of the film, and the scenes and soundtrack combined with the dialogue to form a lighthearted, enjoyable story."

","I was waiting for this movie since first trailer was launched. And when i had opportunity to watch it, i was more than happy. Great story line, reminds me Garfield and his new ""friend"" dog. Many characters such as lazy cat and hamster who can't find his way home made movie incredible funny. I love Kevin Hart voice and his expressions being that little, loud and angry bunny makes it more interesting. The writing was excellent, made my mom, youngest sister, and myself constantly laugh. To the targeted demographic that the film focuses on, this film will be a sure fire box office hit to them. I hope that there will be a second part of this life of pets."

","I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. The writing was excellent, made my wife, youngest son, and myself constantly laugh, which isn't always easy for all 3 of us, simultaneously. The character development for these characters was interesting, as we were shown many facets of their psyche, which made it even more entertaining. I was waiting for the spot in the movie that would make me roll my eyes, as I find in most animated movies I have previously viewed, but it never happened. The adding of the little Minions vignette was hilarious to me, but not my family, which is fine, especially since I haven't seen either one of the Despicable movies, nor the Minion movie. A great family movie, 10 out of a 10 for me was a must...!!"

","If you are looking for a movie full of dramatic moments; slow pace and sadness; that basically bore your kids but make the critics praise as a masterpiece; stop reading and go to see some PIXAR / Disney movie (like Dory or Zootopia) and watch your kids get impatient to get out of the cinema. <br/><br/>If on the other hand; you want your kids to laugh non-stop for about 90 minutes and you enjoy with them; then do not loose one minute, get tickets for the Secret Life of Pet and start laughing on the first minute with the Minions short and keep doing it short until the very end of titles. There is some moral message about friendship, trust and love; but it will be guilty pleasure laugh and a few suspenseful moments.<br/><br/>***SPOILER AHEAD**** Word of advice and possible spoiler; Snowball (the rabbit) is the most twisted character seen lately in movies; it can easily be part of an horror movie; but as played by Kevin Hart; it is historically funny whenever on screen. The same can be said for Gidget (played by Jenny Slate); her transition from a white sweet puppy to a dangerous and terrifying fighter is another of the top moments of the movie. ****END OF SPOILER****<br/><br/>In brief; it will not win any Oscars; but is still the funniest movie of the summer."

"rannynm","9","28","54","1 July 2016"," Loved it! Completely funny and silly
","I could not wait to see The Secret Life of Pets and I was not disappointed! I LOVED it! The Secret Life of Pets is an animated comedy that is both funny and sincere. It is about a dog named Max (Louis C.K.), his new brother Duke (Eric Stonestreet) and their friends. Max doesn't like Duke so he does things that he hopes will get him kicked out of the family home. One day Max comes up with an idea that he hopes will get Duke taken away. His idea backfires and causes Max and Duke to get caught and almost sent to the pound. Will Max and Duke get home? Will their friends find them and help them get home? <br/><br/>My favorite character is Gidget (Jenny Slate) who is a white little dog who likes Max. She is very sweet and kind, but when it comes to helping her friends, she will fight anyone. This is a funny trait of Gidget's because she is a super sweet dog but she will fight to protect her loved ones.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Duke and Max are in a wiener factory and there is a little song where the hot dogs come to life. Little kids might not like this scene because the singing hot dogs get eaten by Duke and Max and they eat the hot dog's heads off.<br/><br/>Though there are many morals to this movie, the most important is ""Do not judge someone before you get to know them."" Max doesn't like Duke when he first comes, but later on he learns to appreciate him. <br/><br/>The Secret Life of Pets is a funny cartoon about cute animals, but it may not appeal to younger audiences. There are some scenes that might be too scary for little kids. Also, Max and Duke say this to save their lives but, be forewarned they do say ""put their owner in the blender.""<br/><br/>I recommend The Secret Life of Pets for kids ages 5 to 15 due to the scary scenes. Older audiences may like this movie if they love animals and fun cartoons. I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars because it is entertaining and about my favorite subject...animals!<br/><br/>Reviewed by Mia A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."

","The Secret Life of Pets (2016) is probably one of Illuminations best. Not being a huge fan of Minions (2015) I was happy that Illumination and Universal Pictures could pull off another good project just like the first Despicable Me (2010). The Secret Life of Pets (2016) is a fun lighthearted animation comedy aimed more towards younger children. One of the main characters named snowball (Kevin Hart) can be quite scary towards more sensitive younger viewers but his behavior is all comedic. It is great but not the highlight of the summer. Movies like Central Intelligence (2016) and Finding Dory (2016) took the top spots though. The movie is a bit of fun for families with younger children who want a 90 minute film with plenty of giggles and smiles. Louis C.K plays Max the main protagonist and Eric Stonestreet plays Duke the co-protagonist. All in all The Secret Life of Pets gives viewers a fun and energetic movie."

Wiener Kingdom sequence is a hoot, funny; love the animal expressions. Some have criticized the manic pace, but I didn't find it particularly ""manic"" - animated movies have to be in constant motion to keep attention.

I could not stop laughing at this movie it so many great characters. Very fun and entertaining movie for the whole family, this movie took me off guard and laughed so much at the roles the characters had. It was such an adorable movie.<br/><br/>A Jack Russell Terrier named Max lives with his owner Katie in a Manhattan apartment. While she is at work during the day, he hangs out with other pets in the building: tabby cat Chloe, pug dog Mel, dachshund dog Buddy, and budgerigar birb Sweetpea. One day, Katie adopts Duke, the big brown dog from the pound, leaving Max jealous because of her larger focus on Duke. One day, because of attitude max toward Duke, the duke draped Max to alley and abandon Max there; however, they are both attacked by a gang of alley cats led by Sphynx cat Ozone. The cats remove both dogs' collars and leave them to be caught by Animal Control. <br/><br/>They are rescued by a rabbit named Snowball, the leader of ""The Flushed Pets""– a gang of sewer-dwelling animals who hate humans. After Max and Duke pretend to despise humans as much as they do, the Flushed Pets invite them to join. Before they can prove their loyalty to Snowball, The two dogs escape the sewers. Snowball vows to kill them and leads the Flushed Pets after them.<br/><br/>A white dog who has a crush on Max, discovers that he is missing, and recruits red-tailed hawk, Gidget (the white dog) and Tiberius (the hawk) then enlist Mel (The fat dog), Buddy(a sarcastic dachshund dog), Chloe(a gray cat), guinea pig Norman(a guinea pig), Sweetpea(a small birb), and a paralyzed old base hound named Pops to begin searching Max. The group encounters Snowball, who vows to kill them as well, and Norman (a guinea pig) is captured as the rest of Gidget(the white dog )'s team flees. <br/><br/>In Brooklyn, Max and Duke begin to get along with each other. Duke tells Max about his previous owner, Fred, an elderly man, live with him with happy life. One day, Duke got lost while chasing a butterfly and was picked up by Animal Control. Max convinces him to visit Fred's house in a nearby neighborhood, confident that Fred will still love him. When they arrive, though, they learn from a resident cat named Reginald that Fred has died. Resentful and angry, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him and barks at the new homeowners who call Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke interferes for him to escape and ends up being captured instead. <br/><br/>While trying to rescue Duke as he follows the Animal Control van, Max is attacked by Snowball and his comrades. However, Snowball's gang are captured by animal control, and Snowball decides to help Max rescue them. They drive by a city bus and crash into the van of animal control on the Brooklyn Bridge, stopping traffic. The animal control van falls into the East River with Max and Duke inside. Max is unable to get the keys to Duke's cage, so Snowball jumps into the river to retrieve them, allowing Max and Duke to escape the sinking van. <br/><br/>The entire group return to the apartment by taxi. Max expresses his appreciation toward Gidget. Snowball and the Flushed Pets then come up with a new plan to annihilate all humans, but Snowball is then adopted by a little girl named Molly. At first, Snowball resists, but gives in to her sweetness and lets himself be adopted by her. Max and Duke finally reunite with Katie, sparking a true friendship."

"gricey_sandgrounder","7","24","46","18 June 2016"," The studios best film since Despicable Me
","With the animation genre in such a golden age, more and more studios are starting to drop their name into the mix.<br/><br/>The latest one is Illumination Entertainment. After starting really well with Despicable Me, it has seemed to have made OK flicks such as Hop, The Lorax, Despicable Me 2 and Minions.<br/><br/>Now we have what many people are hyping as their best feature since Despicable Me, in the form The Secret Life Of Pets. The marketing has been pretty good and trailer suggests a good time at the cinema.<br/><br/>For me, I was pretty satisfied with what I saw. The first third of the film was its strongest part. It was introducing the characters well, there were some solid laughs and they were setting up the story nicely. However the longer the film went on, the slightly sillier it was getting. It was starting to lose its feet, and the gags were getting a bit too much. Thankfully, it was not that bad at all on the whole. It was still moving a long nicely, the characters were being solidly developed and the story rounded off pretty well. I think it might have peaked too soon and everything else felt inferior.<br/><br/>The voice performances were good. Jenny Slate continues to do well in her voice work and I felt she gave the strongest performance. Kevin Hart played his character really well, and had some nice laughs. Louis C.K. was well cast as the lead and gave us a character you could root for. The rest did their job well. They were not good enough to be memorable, but not bad enough to be negatively criticised.<br/><br/>On the technical side, the animation looked really nice and fitted the tone well. The action was entertaining if not a bit over the top at times. The character designs were strong, and I can see them being sold well as merchandise.<br/><br/>Overall, some of it felt disappointing. But on the whole I had a fairly good time watching this. It is definitely the studio's best film since Despicable Me. But with so many other animation studios delivering much stronger films at the moment, this could be forgotten sooner than you think. This might not do as well in the box office as originally expected. Especially a new Pixar film on the way.<br/><br/>There is also a short before the main film, and it features the studios most famous characters. It was o.k. But nowhere near as strong as Pixar's shorts."

It was AWFUL. Nothing made sense, none of the characters are likable, and the antagonist's plot line is DARK (at one point they ask about the details of how the main characters killed their human masters and the villain seems to take pleasure that they killed them with a blender). There's also some weirdly racist line from Kevin Hart about a raccoon lying about being the President. I've seen a lot of animated movies that are great for kids but adults can also enjoy.

","Unlike some of the better Pixar animated feature length films (like Finding Nemo and Toy Story) there's really not much here. (In spite of the fact that it borrows liberally from these movies, and certain Disney classics.) Don't know if it was just a ""me too"" money grab, or if the writers/producers intended to convey more depth, and just missed. The gags are cliché, the characters are very flat and rehashed at best, boring at worst. It drew laughs at a couple of points, but mostly my reaction was ""yeah, that was much funnier when (fill in movie here) did it"". The movie clocked in at less than an hour-and-a-half, but seemed much longer. That's not a compliment - it dragged. Maybe it was targeted only at young kids, and maybe young kids will enjoy it more. It actually did seem to have more of a Saturday morning cartoon feel than a feature-length film feel. <br/><br/>Maybe you'll enjoy it - there certainly are more than a few positive reviews here - but it's not one that I'll watch again (unlike some of those Pixar and Disney movies which stand up to repeated re- viewing)."

"RLTerry1","9","15","29","8 July 2016"," Illumination's Answer to Toy Story
","When well-developed setups lead to brilliantly executed gags, throw in some adorable house pets and endearing street animals and you get Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment's answer to what toys do when the owners aren't around, The Secret Life of Pets. More precisely, this movie could be described as Toy Story meets Oliver and Company meets Homeward Bound. Backed by an exquisitely talented cast of voice actors and excellent writing, The Secret Life of Pets could be what ushers Illumination Entertainment (an NBCU company) into the ring with Disney- Pixar. Prior to this movie, Illumination/Universal certainly created some fantastic animated films including The Lorax, Despicable Me, and others; but this film is the first to really be on par with the Disney-Pixar quality that many of us have come to love and expect. Fast-paced and comedically timed very well, this movie is sure to entertain and warm the hearts of anyone who sits down to watch it. Is it quite as endearing as Toy Story? Not exactly; but it is very close and serves as evidence that we should come to expect this quality and higher of animation from Universal/Illumination. Although the movie is marketed to kids and teenagers, there is certainly enough comedic subtext, easter eggs, and nods to films that adults will greatly appreciate as well. One of my personal favorites is in the Millions short film before the feature. One of the minions is wearing a hat that states ""let it grow"" while he's cutting the grass.<br/><br/>When Max (Louis C.K.), a spoiled terrier living in a New York City apartment building with a beautiful view meets his new roommate, his perfect world is rocked. New roommate Duke (Eric Stonestreet), a giant rambunctious dog, mixes as well with Max as oil does with water. They are complete opposites in nearly every way. Max soon gets the idea to set Duke up for failure by sabotaging the house. Unfortunately that idea backfires and just serves to stoke the fire of animosity. After a prank in the park takes a turn for the worst, both Max and Duke are lost in the seedy underbelly of New York City. <br/><br/>The Secret Life of Pets' success is in-part due to the successful setup and payoff of gags. This can be a dangerous platform on which to build an animated comedy because there is a high risk of the narrative primarily resting upon the gags instead of the gags enhancing the diegesis. Fortunately for audiences, this film successfully pairs a well-developed and paced narrative that will keep your attention and deliver laughs for the entire runtime. Sometimes comedies, whether animated or live action, can spend too much time in the development of gags rather than on the visual storytelling. For instance, some movies write the gags first and then try to integrate a story that attempts to tie all of them together. What I appreciate about The Secret Life of Pets is the strong story inclusive of sight gags and double entendre humor to satisfy a diverse audience from different backgrounds and ages. In addition to the writing, the vocal talents are also instrumental in the success of this animated feature. Leading the ""pack"" are of course comedians Louis C.K. and Kevin Hart, but the entire cast is perfectly pairs with his or her animated persona. For the cat lovers out there (and yes, I am one of them), there are deftly come good comedic jabs at dogs. But the dogs also get in some good ones on the cats. Haha.<br/><br/>The setting of the movie is New York City, or an idealistic surreal New York City slightly augmented to fit the pacing, genre, and feeling of the film. I'd like to know what job Katie has to be able to live by herself in an apartment with such a beautiful view. But I suppose it's just as well that we don't since the focus is on the dogs. On the view from the apartment, though. Much like the view from Frasier's upscale urban trend-setting apartment in Seattle faced a view of the Seattle skyline that doesn't actually exist, unless you are looking at downtown from the surrounding mountains and hills, I am not entirely sure the view from Katie's Manhattan apartment exists either. The view of the city seen from Frasier's apartment was selected in order for the Space Needle to have a prominent placement in the skyline. In the same vein, I believe that the unrealistic view from Katie's apartment was selected in order for the Freedom Tower to have a strong presence. I know, I am analyzing an element that doesn't really have an affect upon the film; but since the film is actually very well done, I thought it would be fun to look at the setting of the movie.<br/><br/>Although I can almost guarantee you that his film won't see an Oscar nom in the animated feature category, much less a win, since the Academy believes that only Pixar can create Oscar-worthy animated films, I find The Secret Life of Pets to be a fantastic animated feature filled with action, adventure, comedy, and some touching moments as well. All around, it is enjoyable for the whole family and will cause many owners to wonder what their pet does while he or she is away at work. One of my favorite parts of the movie is the musical sequence at the sausage factory. So much symbolism to discuss. Haha. So, yes. This movie even includes a musical number worthy of–I am sure–many memes to come over the next few months."

If you specify American monsters, Bigfoot, the Boogie Man, Candyman, and The Duke are on the tips of everyone's tongues. PETS cleverly provides animated documentation of Duke's decades-long rampage through American Life and Culture during the 1900s, as the usurper of U.S. dog Max's Home Sweet Home. (If you're not up on 1900s American History, a boy named Marion got depressed over his Ma running out on his dying Pa and renamed himself after the family mutt, as ""Duke (Mad Dog) Wayne."" Shortly thereafter, this struggling cheap-flick ""singing cowboy"" was recruited to the Dark Side by the American Fascist Party, where he literally fingered thousands of Real Life Working Stiffs for bankruptcy, political prisons, ""suicide,"" and premature death as the self-appointed U.S. Snitch-in-Chief.) In PETS, gluttonous Big Dawg Duke steals Max's food, bed, and mistress before turning Max over to dogcatchers.

","I'm not one to really gawk at the vocal cast of an animated film, but Illumination Entertainment (of Despicable Me fame) sure knows how to pick them.<br/><br/>In their sixth motion picture, the studio gives us a peek at what our pets do when we're not home. It begins with Max (Louis C.K.), a small dog who loves his owner more than life itself. He stands in front of the door all day just waiting for her to come home. Then one day, she does, but brings in with her a very large dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet).<br/><br/>You may only get the jokes and the high-flying emotions if you have pets of your own. Luckily, most of America does in one way or another. Anyone who does knows how unbelievably ridiculous they can be sometimes. And this movie goes the route of exploiting that a bit, without actually trying to make sense of it--because, what fun would that be? Some may be bothered by the fact that it borrows from the premise of Toy Story--and a couple other Pixar gems. I'm not one of those. It's a smart move. And besides, there's much more to the story than just a simple two-misunderstood-individuals-journeying-home-together angle. There are multiple plots working at once.<br/><br/>We don't just see Max and Duke trying to find their way back, but also a gang of Max's friends setting out to find him--led by a paralyzed blind dog and a spoiled rich dog who longs to profess her love for Max.<br/><br/>There are some moments where it becomes very dark, but the issues come with how it handles those dark moments. It has a couple of chances--both of which it fails miserably.<br/><br/>The energy never lets up, and that plays as more of a good thing than bad in The Secret Life of Pets. Your kids will love it and the laughter is pretty consistent from start to finish. It may not have the same emotional punch of Despicable Me, but it knows how to make us laugh, thoroughly showcasing the world that it wants us to see.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 89"

","In this Illumination (the makers of the Despicable Me series) computer-animated feature film, we see the animals talking after their owners leave for the day (just like the toys in the Toy Story series) and doing their own thing. The main character is a dog named Max who suddenly is being paired with a much bigger dog and he doesn't like it. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a funny and partly touching take on the ""animals on the loose in the city"" premise with many fine support from many of the other animals involved including a rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. By the way, I was wonderfully surprised that among the other celebrities doing voices was one Albert Brooks who I previously also just heard reprising his Marlin fish character in Finding Dory. So on that note, I recommend The secret Lives of Pets."

","Cute, funny, and not always predictable. I went to see this movie thinking it would just be funny. I expected it to be pointless, but the plot was pretty complex. The previews don't show you what it's really about. The story stayed exciting for the whole hour and a half. The characters were adorable and entertaining. The animation was pretty good, too. There are actually some scenes that make you feel like you're flying or falling even in 2-D. I wouldn't say this was *as good* as a Pixar movie, but it will definitely be on the list of nominees for best animated picture. I will add a warning: Do not bring children under the age of 5 unless they're pretty mature for their age and won't freak out. This is not mindless entertainment. There are crocodiles, monstrous snakes, and scary-looking killer cats, and there are scenes where it seems like a couple of the characters are going to die. A kid who looked to be about 2 screamed and cried at the more tense moments. This movie isn't graphic, but it will scare babies and very young kids. It's PG and not just G for a reason."

","I think I have never wrote any review before after I watched a bad movie, but this one managed to lower the bar to a level where I simply cannot hold it back.<br/><br/>I was very much looking forward to this animation movie as the trailer was great and very promising (5 stars for the marketing people, they sold it).<br/><br/>I don't even know where to start. It is not funny at all. It is so not funny that they had to repeat the only reasonable joke we saw in the trailer 3(!) times (the headbanging poodle).<br/><br/>People did not laugh at all, not even the children! The conversations are horribly written, felt like they pulled out lines from the same kind of movies made in the last 20 years. Matter of fact the jokes that are also badly build up are also the same boring jokes that we saw before.<br/><br/>The characters are weak, the motivations are simply stupid and the series of events is just a big idiotic cliché.<br/><br/>I don't know what is the big hype around Kevin Hart lately, but he is bad as an actor and he proved himself to be bad as voice actor. Many times I did not understand what he screams, because all he does in every movie is shout in that very high pitch tone. You know what, I dare to say his character is based upon some racist stereotype cliché too, as no surprises he is the black gangsta type of character (at least act like one even though his character intended to be some sort of underground revolutionary leader, yet all they managed to come up with is a bad ""I am small and cool and crazy kind of gangsta).<br/><br/>There are completely unnecessary scenes, just to squeeze out some sort of emotion from the audience and they sweat so they put some also cliché music behind it. Everything is so predictable and cheap in the plot and with the characters that is just amazing.<br/><br/>There is one beautiful thing in the whole movie and it is the look of the water, matter of fact it is pretty, but what for? It is the same old Hollywood mistake repeated again, beautiful visuals and awful content.<br/><br/>Would it be a disaster for once to spend more money and time on the plot and the character development and not just on the jaw dropping CGI.<br/><br/>We all get used to off the good cgi. We know what is possible.<br/><br/>Sometimes I have the feeling it is nothing else just some arty farty cgi show off with people who cannot grasp the possibilities of their own work.<br/><br/>Do not waste 90 minutes from your life with this rubbish."
"topeka_brooks","10","8","14","30 August 2016"," A friend in Need is a Friend Indeed
","The Secret Life of Pets is an easy kid flick. It entertains without pressure. Limited animated violence, no sex, no foul language to speak of, and an easy-going plot make Secret Life an easy film to like.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Secret Life is a buddy movie. Max and Duke are thrown together by circumstances, and neither one of them likes it. They try to sabotage each other with disastrous consequences.<br/><br/>Lost in Brooklyn and separated from their friends, the two adversaries have to work together to get back home. In so doing, they become friends.<br/><br/>As the cliché-proverb goes, a friend in need is a friend indeed.<br/><br/>The film is kid-friendly, and only the youngest viewers might be upset. Unless your child is especially sensitive, I would recommend it for any kid over 5. I took my daughter, but then - she's 25, so she doesn't count as a kid I suppose.<br/><br/>The only serious action is the death of a large snake. The snake is the author of his own demise though as he tries to eat our heroes. The episode is a clear turning point for Max and Duke.<br/><br/>Animation decisions were excellent. Not too realistic, but not skimpy either. Secret Life is not a Miyazaki film, but then again Studio Ghibli is in a class of its own.<br/><br/>Voice casting and acting was also excellent. Snowball was the only questionable acting job, and that was definitely not Kevin Hart's fault, but the fault of the writer or director who demanded rapid switching between a 'crazed' rabbit and 'leader' rabbit.<br/><br/>Snowball is also the only character who made a sudden almost inexplicable decision to redeem himself after Max saves his life. The overall plot arch is fine, and a life-changing experience is a great tool to drive a character to switch his allegiance, but it's apparent that the artistic team was in a brain fog on the day they had to figure out how to get from Max saving Snowball to Snowball saving Max and Duke.<br/><br/>About the rating: Folks, if you like a film, don't waste your vote. Give a 10. If it's mediocre, give it a 5. If it sucks, give it a 1.<br/><br/>Secret Life does not deserve a 6.8. It's not a classic, and it's not a film that you will want to see again and again, but then it's not some dreadful propaganda flick, nor is it an awful chick flick, a foul-mouthed gore fest, nor a CGI sleep fest that requires two toothpicks to hold open your eyelids. If you're in the target audience, you probably will not want a refund of your money and your time.<br/><br/>Secret Life delivered what was expected. Clean, family, kid-safe, safe-space fare for a few bucks.<br/><br/>If Hollywood made more movies like Secret Life, they might not win awards at Sundance or Canne, but they might lure audiences back to the movies ..."

Many characters, especially dog characters feels familiar, especially if you have ever owned a dog. Nostalgic music makes you feel familiar and patch up some flaws at script. Movie is so full of particulars that you certainly can enjoy this many time. If there is something to accuse, the script is quite simple and used many times and you could get much more out of the communication between animal characters and humans. More laugh out of that.

"japamo","8","7","12","18 July 2016"," Pet Story (Alternate Title: Underground Zootopia)
","Yeah, I know, I'm certainly not the first reviewer to realize that the plot of the animated""The Secret Life of Pets (hereafter ""Secret Life"") closely resembles that of the ""Toy Story"" trilogy. Hence, the first title of this review. Nevertheless, the borrowed plot is an ideal vehicle for answering one of the baffling mysteries of our time: what do pets really act like when their owners are away (you can solve that problem with security cameras, but never mind)? The unsurprising answer is: when the cat's away the mice will play, so to speak. In other words, the cats, dogs, birds, and other assorted domesticated animals in a New York apartment building cut loose and party, stuff themselves, and basically wreck the joint.<br/><br/>Except for one brown-and-white Jack Russell terrier named Max (voice of Louis C.K.). Little Max is generally liked and respected by all the other apartment building animals, even by the obese, sarcastic, misbehaving tabby cat Chloe (voice of Lake Bell). In particular, the fuzzy, hyperactive, but gutsy Pomeranian Gidget (voice of Jenny Slate) harbors an unrequited crush for Max. Max is content being a kind of ""top dog"" and the apple of his owner Katie's (voice of Ellie Kemper) eye. The only downside is that Max suffers acute separation anxiety whenever Katie is out of the apartment, and is willing to stare at the front door all day until she returns.<br/><br/>Katie seems to realize that Max is lonely, so she brings home a new dog – a huge, brown, generally good-natured Newfoundland named Duke. Max is none too thrilled with his new roommate, despite Duke's efforts to make friends. In fact, Max is so eager to get rid of Duke, he breaks apartment items and tries to frame Duke. Max and Duke become bitter rivals. But before the rivalry can escalate, both dogs get lost in New York during one of their walks, lose their collars and licenses during an encounter with an army of fierce alley cats, and begin a frantic run to get away from them AND Animal Control officers and get home.<br/><br/>Animal Control catches Max and Duke, but they escape their cages with the help of the maniacal, bitter, abandoned (like Lotso Hugging Bear in ""Toy Story 3"") white rabbit named Snowball (voice of Kevin Hart), the unlikely leader of a menagerie of other abandoned animals of ALL kinds, including snakes, alligators, and lizards. Hence the second, alternate title of this review. Snowball frees Max and Duke only because they pretend to agree to help him carry out his vengeful desire to punish humanity for their abandonment. But the ruse can only last so long; Snowball figures out the dogs are domesticated ""sellouts"", so Max and Duke have to put their differences aside even longer to escape a third group that wants to capture/destroy them.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Gidget is the first apartment pet to realize that Max and Duke have been gone an awfully long time. Therefore, the fearless Pomeranian rallies the other pets, including the energetic pug Mel (voice of Bobby Moynihan), the stretchy wiener dog Buddy (voice of Hannibal Buress), the confused guinea pig Norman (voice of Chris Renaud), and even a red-tailed hawk with almost overwhelming predatory instincts named Tiberius (voice of Albert Brooks), to mount a rescue mission. On their way to save Max and Duke, they meet an old, cantankerous, handicapped, but New York-smart basset hound named Pops (voice of Dana Carvey) who grudgingly offers to help ferret Max and Duke out. And so were off on a merry, almost exhausting, almost non-stop chase above and below New York to see who will get to Max and Duke first – Snowball and his scary ""henchmen"" or Gidget and her motley crew- and to see if the mismatched pooches make it home after all.<br/><br/>""Secret Life"" is perfect for summer because it is loaded with action, gut-busting laughter, wild fantasy, and memorable characters. But the movie is not mindless because it manages to sneak in lessons about forging alliances and friendships, the sometimes cruel things humans do to animals, and the sacrifices true friends make for each other. There is even pathos, as when former pound pooch Duke tries to locate his former owner and realizes that in one sense you really can't go home again. In short, ""Secret Life"" is bound to please both adults and children, but it is rated PG for a reason, because some of the animals, especially the colossal, one-fanged viper that challenges Max and Duke to battle, might terrify impressionable children, and because there is at least one reference to death. Still ""Secret Life"", despite its derivative plot, or more likely because of it, is a fun, fitting tribute to pets that deserve human love because of the comfort and devotion they give, even if they make the occasional mess.<br/><br/>P.S.: Preceding ""Secret Life"" is an animated ""Illumination"" short called ""Mowin' Minions"" where the little yellow guys in blue overalls perform yard work to raise enough money to buy a blender. The expected, irresistibly hilarious roller coaster ride of chaos ensues."

Animation was good, voice acting was above average. I felt that there was almost no depth of story. I have a yardstick movie to measure all other animated movies, the movie ""Cars"". It was funny, and it also did have a great message which I remember everyday in my life (The motto: ""Winning Piston cups means nothing after a while""), but you would not find anything for that. Character development was weak, you would wonder why one character is caring just too much for other character, why one character is acting so strangely, why some character suddenly is becoming super fighter. These things will bug you. But kids will not think about these deep stuffs. They will just watch the movie and will enjoy the movie a lot.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend to take your kids to show this amazing movie, they deserve to see this.

"CANpatbuck3664","8","6","10","30 July 2016"," A Complete Surprise, The Secret Life of Pets is Well-Animated and Fun for the Whole Family
","In a lot of reviews, people mention how much expectations can play a part in how you view a movie. It's always best to go in with low expectations because the chances that high expectations will be met on every level is rare. It's really cool when something completely subverts those initial thoughts and gives you a much more enjoyable experience. Coincidentally, when I think of movies that were surprisingly good, I remember the first time I saw Despicable Me. I wasn't expecting much at all and it was really great. I thought the trailers for The Secret Life of Pets were interesting but they didn't show much about the plot and I wasn't sure about how good the movie would be. Having seen it now, I didn't have any reason to be worried, it's another solid movie from Illumination Entertainment and I wouldn't be surprised if it spawns a few sequels.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie is set in modern day New York. Max, who is a short haired terrier (Louis C.K.), lives with his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper). He loves her completely and shares how the have the perfect relationship, doing all sorts of fun things in the city. Max describes them as soulmates and the only downside is that of course she has to leave for work everyday. When their owners leave, their pets in Max's building get to hangout and let loose. Other pets in the immediate area include: Chloe (Lake Bell), Gidget (Jenny Slate), Mel (Bobby Moniyhan), and Buddy (Hannibal Buress). They all deal with their owners being away in their own different ways. But when Katie finally does arrive home on that day, she brings a different dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Duke is a big dog (I don't know if they ever mention his breed) and clashes with Max immediately. Duke acts like he owns the place and Max is unwilling to share. This leads to them clashing from their first meeting and Max begins to come up with a plan to get rid of Duke.<br/><br/>I'll talk more about the story of The Secret Life of Pets later, I'll first touch on the animation. Some people have been critical of the Despicable Me movies for being lazy in this part. The humans of the story are animated in the same way as the Despicable Me movies but the design of the pets in this movie was impressive. It felt like most of the effort went into those pieces of the movie and it really helped elevate it. Each of the animals have a unique look that is fun to watch and combine that with their respective character quirks, you have a movie that's worth seeing just for that reason. The background design was also good and although the animators romanticize the city of New York a little bit, it is a kids movie so showing the seedy underbelly of the city would be understandably too dark.<br/><br/>Moving from character design to character development, some of the strongest and weakest parts are shown in the writing of this movie. On the positive side, the side characters are so much better than they need to be. Characters like Gidget, Tiberius, Snowball, Pops and Chloe are great and their scenes together are the best parts of the movie. It's rare that the supporting characters outshine the main ones so much but that's either a positive or a negative depending on how you see it. The downside I really didn't find Max or Duke likable or even interesting to watch. Even for a moving that's taking beats from Toy Story where Woody is a morally grey character, these guys are jerks and although you don't want to see them hurt, you don't really care that much if they get back to Katie.<br/><br/>The voice acting is pretty good, some parts are more memorable than others. Again, my favourite was Gidget voiced by Jenny Slate. I'm familiar with her from House of Lies but I didn't recognize her, she does a great job. I also really liked Albert Brooks as Tiberius. He's a veteran with all his work on Finding Nemo and Finding Dory but he's really doing something different and it was for the best. Kevin Hart is doing Kevin Hart but his energy and enthusiasm is contagious and it makes Snowball a better villain for it. I also really liked Dana Carvey as Pops. Louis C.K. and Eric Stonestreet are respectively decent in their parts, they aren't terribly memorable but they both do their jobs.<br/><br/>Much like several of Illumination's movies (except for Minions, I thought that was only okay) it might not be Pixar quality but it never really tries to be. This is a movie that aims just to be fun (I say that from the perspective that the plot of this movie borrows from so many other animated movies, it's not about the story) and it easily achieves that goal. I think this is a movie that kids will love and adults will find things to enjoy despite the fact it doesn't come in completely fresh and new."
"aileencorcoran","7","6","10","24 July 2016"," The Secret Life of Pets
","Let's face it, we as pet owners have always wondered what our furry friends are up to when we're not home. It's an idea that has been played around with for years, from Tom and Jerry to Phineas and Ferb. As ideas go, it isn't original, but the possibilities it can bring are endless. When Illumination Entertainment, the French animation studio behind monster hits such as Despicable Me and Minions (the first non-Disney animated film to earn a billion worldwide) launched a teaser trailer documenting the mischief pets get up to, curiosities were peaked. The world cried in unison; what does this animation studio think pets do? We already have pets as spies, pets being obsessive compulsive mouse hunters, and pets finding their way home. There is still so much one can do with this age old trope, if one is clever enough. What we got, is a beautifully animated flick with plenty of humour and good spirits that packs too much into its run time that has good intentions, despite borrowing heavily from a certain 1990s film.<br/><br/>The film opens with our protagonist, Max (Louis C.K.), a Jack Russell Terrier living in New York City with his owner, Katie. Max, like any terrier, is full of beans and love for his master; Illumination got the happy go lucky attitude of the Jack Russell down perfectly. They also got the territorial side, for when Katie brings home a Newfoundland mix named Duke (Eric Stonestreet), Max is less than impressed. Not wanting his perfect life torn upside down by the hairy interloper, Max tries his darndest to get rid of him, leading, of course, to the pair getting whisked away by the pound when Duke tries to dispose of Max. Naturally, the pooches must cope with each other and find their way home, but not without obstacles; underneath the belly of NYC is an underground secret society of abandoned and unwanted animals, led by the not so cuddly rabbit, Snowball (Kevin Hart). Due to accidentally offing a valuable member of the society, Snowball and his henchmen swear vengeance on our furry duo. While all this madness is afoot, a Pomeranian named Gidget, who has a major crush on Max, enlists the help of all their animal neighbours to save him. <br/><br/>The main issue of the film, and it's a biggie, is that it's Toy Story with pets. There's no sugar coating it. The main species has a social circle that their owners aren't aware of. The main character loves his owner so much, and is insanely jealous when they bring home someone new. When one is trying to get rid of the other, they end up far away from home, and have to find their way back. They even have elements of Toy Story 2 and 3; friends coming together to find the main character, and a seemingly cute antagonist causing chaos. The only real original element is that the animals have their own language; they don't harbour the ability to speak to humans. Despite this, the film isn't a dud. By now, you've already heard from many sources about the parallels with Toy Story, and, if you're open minded, can enjoy the film for what it is; a slapstick comedy with talking animals. It doesn't remove the issue, but it allows one to see the effort the creators put in to the rest of the film. <br/><br/>The animation is fantastic; the textures and anatomy of the animals, while stylised, is still very true to what it represents. The look and feel of New York is large in scale and immensely colourful. The characters look like they have weight to them, that despite their cartoony appearance, they could be real animals. The characters are likable and cute, with the actors making them sound like they are animals; in better terms, you believe they are animals, not animals being voiced by humans. I don't know how they managed that, but they did. <br/><br/>What little character development is present it given to Max and Duke, with the latter having a genuinely heartbreaking moment which is sadly glanced over, and thrown aside. There is so much life and likability here. The only issue with character, is that there's too many to remember, and not enough time to get to know them. It's a good thing when you want to see more of the characters, but it also gives glaring warning signs: an inevitable sequel. Or perhaps, that may be a good thing. For this film, despite its flaws, seems like it could be the precursor to a creative franchise. There is so much that can be done with these characters, and with this world, that a sequel would be welcomed. The only issue is, would it be milked to the death like the poor Minions? <br/><br/>The jokes are mostly funny, with some misses; there is a jab at YouTube cat videos that will forever be relevant, and the metal loving poodle is amazing. The little quirks that the animators and actors gave the animals are fantastic, such as the dogs having short attention spans, and the cat sitting in too small containers. There's a lot for pet owners to relate to, especially in the ending. <br/><br/>It may be a mixed bag, but it's a good, likable one. The Secret Life of Pets had potential to be amazing, and still has potential to become a creative, lasting franchise. This beautiful film is plenty of bark, with little bite. If you leave without a smile on your face, then you were clearly neutered.<br/><br/>Rating: B2"

That proves that all age groups will love this movie. When it comes to a animated movie, no one really cares about the story line or the plot holes. People just want to watch some funny pets do random things. But, If someone were to choose between this movie and Zootopia then sadly I'll have to go with Zootopia over this movie. But, that doesn't I didn't like the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie will make all ages laugh, you will have a fun time with this movie and when it comes out on blu ray.

"TheSeaLion","1","9","17","8 May 2017"," More Trash from Illumination Entertainment
","""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a movie from the film studio Illumination Entertainment, whose biggest claim to fame has been the creations of the abominable minions from ""Despicable Me."" When little yellow creatures that speak gibberish are your studio's biggest highlight, it's no wonder their film turned out like this.<br/><br/>""The Secret Life of Pets"" is essentially all three ""Toy Story"" movies rolled into one movie with three separate plot lines. The first movie about two rival toys who earn to respect and work with each other is given to the main characters of Max (Louis C.K.) and Duke (Eric Stonestreet). The second movie, where it focuses on all of the secondary characters from the first movie on a mission to save Woody, is showcased with the character Gidget (Jenny Slate) rounding up pets to look for Max and Duke. The antagonist of the movie, a white bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart) has the same character and motivation as Lots-o-Huggin bear from ""Toy Story 3.""<br/><br/>With no original story elements, you'd think there would be an attempt to make the characters likable and engaging to watch, but no. Max and Duke start out as unlikable, and only become likable when they inexplicably begin working together. It makes sense that in one scene they would set aside their differences, but after that there is no reason for them to be working together. Then, they suddenly like each other without any reason to. Gidget is no better, as she dumbly trusts a hawk (Albert Brooks) who was clearly making threats to eat her, but the story must go on. Snowball sums up these idiotic and lazy character moments in one scene where, after trying to kill Max, says, ""We need to work together now,"" and then everything is suddenly put behind them.<br/><br/>Character stupidity is a big propeller of the plot, but pure coincidence is too. Almost no story elements feel like they organically happened, and instead feel contrived or tossed in to make the screenwriter's job easier. Take this for example, New York City is a big place (especially for animals who mostly don't know the city except for what's right outside of their apartments), yet everyone makes their way onto one of New York's bridges for the climax of the movie without having any reason to know that Max and Snowball are there, and thus giving them reason to be there.<br/><br/>To put it in simple terms, this movie is lazy with its characters, uninspired with its story, and unfunny with its comedy. The only thing I can really say in its defense is that the story could at least be followed."
"Filvies144","8","9","17","16 July 2016"," An improvement over Minions, but absolutely not perfect.
","This film is from illumination entertainment, which recently created the first non Disney animated film to crack 1 Billion worldwide, Minions. For my thoughts on the studio, Despicable me 1, and 2 were great, Hop was OK, but forgettable, but The Lorax and especially Minions were bad. Then this film came along.<br/><br/>Easily the weakest part is the writing. It rips off Toy Story using the same concept except with pets, which makes this movie very predictable, often in the first hour. It however, becomes a lot less predictable in the 3rd act, which gives it some suspense. This is also a problem with Independence day resurgence, but unlike that movie, the concept is well executed, which makes this movie entertaining. I had a good time watching it because of that. But overall, this writing is mediocre.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are one of my favorite parts. Max is, however the weaker one who is like Woody from Toy Story, who is a jerk to his companion at first, but then grows to be friends with him. The rest of the characters are all lovable and enjoyable to watch, suck as Duke, Gidget, Chloe, and more. But my favorite one is the bunny Snowball, who is the funniest, with Kevin Hart making a good performance as the bunny that looks cute but has a violent personality, making him the villain.<br/><br/>New York City is one of my favorite cities in the world, and New York looks like nothing I've ever seen before. It perfectly shows all the attractions such as the One World Trade Center, Times square, Central Park, and Brooklin in way I've never seen in animation. Also, the design of the pets are accurate as they are both cute and well designed. The only part I don't like about the animation is the human design, which is always rather weak in Illumination movies. Along with this high quality animation, the humor hits a lot, with very smart gags, and not the very unfunny slapstick in Minions and it also takes a break from DreamWorks like Crass humor. There is an animated short that plays before this called ""Mower Minions"", which is OK and cute, its just that the humor isn't funny, just like the Minions film.<br/><br/>The writing may be weak, but the film is enjoyable with memorable characters, and smart and funny gags. The animation is also breathtaking as heck. I recommend to kids and adults. It may not be as smart as Zootopia, or as unforgettable as Finding Dory, but it is a good addition to the summer."
"MartinHafer","6","3","4","7 August 2018"," Starts off amazingly...then quickly loses momentum
","""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a very successful film from Universal, the same folks who brought us the ""Despicable Me"" franchise. While I am thrilled that the studio decided to do something other than yet another sequel, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a highly uneven movie.<br/><br/>The story starts off terrifically well. The opening sequence is simply breaktaking--with some of the best CGI you'll ever see. I was very impressed with this...as well as watching all the various pets acting like pets. However, the film simply did not maintain this momentum. Once the two dogs, Max and Duke, got lost...so did the story. The notion of human-hating animals living in the sewers and stealing dog pound trucks is pretty stupid....and unappealing. Instead of being cute like the film had been, it tries to get edgy and it misfires. In other words, and this will sound weird, the film was much better when it had little in the way of plot (one of the reasons I loved ""Minions"" is because it was less wedding to plot and more to fun). Overall, an uneven film that becomes somewhat tiresome after a while."
"AustinOswald","7","13","28","19 June 2016"," Great for kids!
","""The Secret Life of Pets"" was indeed 'pawesome', although very over-hyped. That is the case for most of Illumination's projects, so I must start by commending their advertising team. Although this movie was funny, the trailer seemed to showcase most of the jokes and gags seen in the movie. The new jokes that the audience hadn't seen before were more aimed toward the kids, but didn't strike the adults as much as their competing studios (Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, etc.) usually do. With a pretty straight forward plot and a substantial amount of potty humor, I felt this film was more for the kids than for the family. The character development was very robust for the amount of characters featured in the film. There were some under developed characters, but most of the main characters were top of the line. The sewer sequences were very well lit and the animations flowed together and were very finely detailed. The movie was good and the voice actors were top notch. I would recommend if you're looking for a fun movie to watch that's not too thought provoking."
"alanho-63449","7","7","13","10 July 2016"," Not Pixar quality yet a very enjoyable movie
","I rate The Secret Life of Pets between 6.6-7.3/10; the movie started off great but slowly the plot becomes too far-fetched as well as the pace/flow becomes inconsistent, if that makes sense. I know that Illumination wants to build a franchise like Pixar which is similar to Warner Bros wants to build the DC universe to match Marvel Climatic Universe but overall, it just fell flat. This movie's plot has been compared to Toy Story which is true except for the overall product. First, although they tried to make us feel sympathy for Duke but his character is unlikeable, I find him to a bully in the beginning. The scene where Max messes up the apartment to them being taken for a walk by dog-sitter makes no sense! Also the fact that Max & Duke found Duke's original home makes no sense as Duke got lost in the first place. The plot becomes out of control when the pets/animals went rouge and out of control in the city; driving buses & taxes, dresses as a human?? This movie also takes a darker tone when the Viper gets crushed & dies; and Max & Duke gets high through sausages. p.s. I'm not sure if Ricky the duck is a reference to Boyz and the Hood"
"nathannicolarobertscouk","6","6","11","4 July 2016"," Enjoyable, if not original or balanced
","The Secret Life of Pets is an enjoyable tale with an interesting premise and whilst it doesn't perhaps fulfil everything one would hope for, it sets Illumination Entertainment on the right track. It is a concept with a infinite line of inspiration and directions to go, should this it become the breakout smash I suspect it will. It has a lot to learn but that should come with the studio's progression and will to try new things and stand out from the animated crowd. It's certainly not ground-breaking or original in any way, but it may lead to the next big animation house breaking through.<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW: http://goo.gl/Y0cNfa"
"TheLittleSongbird","7","10","22","8 July 2016"," Much to enjoy here
","Not a great film, but a very enjoyable one.<br/><br/>Starting with 'The Secret Life of Pets', while much of the story is charming, beautifully paced without feeling rushed and entertaining, it does run out of steam in the final third where it does drag a bit and feels overstretched.<br/><br/>While the lead characters are likable and interesting, there are too many characters, which are not as fleshed out and some of them not in the film enough to make impact, and the film feels over-populated as a result.<br/><br/>And while a vast majority of the film is incredibly entertaining, not all the jokes work in the final third, being not as well-timed and being a bit too obvious and childish.<br/><br/>However, 'The Secret Life of Pets' is beautifully and vibrantly animated, love the rich colours, meticulously rich backgrounds and the well-modelled character designs. The music score is whimsical and lively.<br/><br/>'The Secret Life of Pets' is also very wittily and often hilariously scripted, some of the best lines coming from Snowball, and there are some neat references to 'Grease', 'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Some Like it Hot.' As said, much of the story is charming with enough of the entertainment factor.<br/><br/>Lastly the voice acting is pretty terrific, Kevin Hart, Albert Brooks and Steve Coogan coming off best.<br/><br/>Overall, there is much to enjoy in 'The Secret Life of Pets', though it is more a good film than a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"TxMike","Null","5","9","15 February 2017"," This movie never engaged us.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. <br/><br/>We like the premise, a humorous take on what pets might do when the owners are away during the day. The thing with a movie like this, or really any movie, it has to engage the viewer by the first 10 to 15 minutes otherwise it will be lost, no matter how good the last parts may be.<br/><br/>This animated movie never engaged us. What we viewed was mainly disjointed sight gags, within a loose story of a small dog suddenly having to share his home and existence with a much larger dog.<br/><br/>It may be good for children, it has some funny stuff in it, but not for us, we did not find it worth our time."
"stevendbeard","7","5","9","9 July 2016"," Great Family Movie
","I saw ""The Secret Life of Pets"", starring the voices of Louis C.K.- American Hustle, Parks and Recreation_tv; Eric Stonestreet-Modern Family_tv, Ninja Cheerleaders; Jenny Slate-Parks and Recreation_tv, This Means War; Kevin Hart-Central Intelligence, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Lake Bell-Children's Hospital_tv, What Happens in Vegas.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie by the studios that brought us the Minions. In fact, there is a Minions short cartoon shown, right before the movie starts-I think it was called Mower Minions. If you have ever wondered what pets do when their owners go to work, this movie gives some interesting guesses. Louis is a small dog-Terrier, I think-and living the perfect life with his owner in New York City. That is until she brings home a second dog, Eric, a big mongrel. Of course, jealousy sets in and after Louis & Eric get separated from their owner, they learn they may just have to work together to survive. Jenny is a small dog that likes Louis so she is the first to notice when he goes missing. Lake is a cat that becomes a member of the search party searching for Louis & Eric and Kevin is a not-so-lovable bunny that is leading stray animals-living in the sewers ever since they were discarded by their owners-in a revolt against humans. It seems that Kevin has anger issues ever since he parted ways with his magician owner. As the end credits start, there is a scene, but nothing at the very end. I enjoyed it and the children with us seemed to like it, too. It's rated ""PG"" for action and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes. I liked it enough that I would buy it on DVD."
"michaelRokeefe","7","5","9","9 July 2016"," Genuine charm. Pets let their hair down.
","Animated fun. Ever wonder what your pets do when you leave? Discipline is caste to the wind. This feature reflects what happens when New York City apartment-dwellers shut the door to go to work. One owner, Katie (Ellie Kemper), leaves her terrier mix named Max (Louis CK), to his usual mundane day of guarding the door waiting on her return. Katie comes home with a huge shaggy dog, rescued from the pound. Now Max reluctantly has a brother named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). The pair are not quick to make friends. But Max and Duke get loose from their dog walker and soon are lost in the big city. Soon it will be manic, and at times, laughable scampering and scooting as a mean-spirited rabbit, Snowball (Kevin Hart), doesn't want the lost dogs in his territory.<br/><br/>Cinematography and animation is top notch. The story line is simple enough and has the right amount of action to please viewers of all ages. Very little obligatory ""potty"" humor. This feature from Illumination is directed by Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud.<br/><br/>Other featured voices include: Jenny Slate, Lake Bell, Dana Carvey, Mel Brooks, Bobby Moynihan, Steve Coogan and Hannibal Buress."
"Equalizer16","7","5","9","9 July 2016"," Pure Enjoyment
","As soon as I saw the first teaser trailer for this film, I knew that I would see it. I didn't care whether it would be good or not I was determined to see it and I can happily say the film delivered exactly what it promises.<br/><br/>Illumination Entertainment who were responsible for Despicable Me have again created a very entertaining piece of animation that will be tickling you through out the hour and half duration. Now you may think that this is basically Toy Story with pets, and you would be right it is, but the film is still new and exciting in its own way.<br/><br/>The Secret Life Of Pets follows the lives of various household pets from dogs to rabbits to birds to crocodiles when their owners are not home. We focus particularly on Max a Jack Russell Terrier who becomes ambushed by a new dog Duke who is to be his brother, but when the two don't get along to start, they will get lost in their home city, (which is meant to be NY) and work together to get home. Also pursuing them is their close friends and a maniac rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart.<br/><br/>To get straight to the point, the film is very enjoyable and entertaining and funny to be enjoyed by children and older audiences as well. The film is not a masterpiece like Inside Out or The LEGO Movie and doesn't have as much depth as Zootropolis, but it is a fun time at the cinema.<br/><br/>It starts of with a very nice establishing tracking shot of the animated city which is very pleasant to look at, and does frequently provide admirable views through out of the landscape. There is also sweetness to it in the relationships between the pets and their owners shown in two montages. All the voice actors also do a splendid job in their role and provide the perfect voices for their characters. With the jokes, there are proper funny jokes and not just plain slapstick, but their is a lot of that. I will say there were moments where the faces of the different characters just brought a smile to my face.<br/><br/>However there are still some flaws. There are too many characters that try all to have their moments, and after a while we kind of forget about them and they are just there. There are smaller stories going on in the film which don't quite meet the climax they are built up to be. Finally, the film does have potential in particular moments to give the film the emotion and depth needed but it doesn't quite flow that way.<br/><br/>I will say I probably would have enjoyed the film even more, but I surrounded by the most annoying people ever in a cinema. So to sum up it s very entertaining and funny, a good time at the cinema, but not a masterpiece in animated family films. 7.7/10"
"jaywensley2004","7","5","9","8 July 2016"," Worth the wait. And Gidget ROCKS!
","I note, happily, that some of the best character driven films of the past 10 years are animated: ""The Incredibles"", ""Finding Nemo"" and especially ""Inside Out"" (the real ""Best Picture"" of 2015) stand tall among a bounty of films where the plot serves the development of the characters and their relationships. Add ""The Secret Life of Pets"" to that list. <br/><br/>While not as good as the previously mentioned movies, ""...Pets"" holds its own: It is entertaining, gorgeous to look at and by the film's end developed in me a sincere affection for several of the characters. Especially Gidget, and I'll get to her shortly.<br/><br/>Opening with a spectacular animated sequence featuring New York City backed by Taylor Swift's ""Welcome to New York"" (the city might want to consider picking Swift's tribute as its new anthem) the Big Apple has never looked better. A smooth segue leads into an extended sequence which will be familiar and welcomed by anyone who has seen the trailer for the film. This is what we came for. Or at least me. I first saw the trailer a year ago (a preview before ""Minions"") and still fall out every time I see Buddy the Dachshund get massaged. This opening provides a satisfying, hilarious and comprehensive introduction to many of the main characters before the movie slowly starts losing its way.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is like many sketch comedy shows: There's a lot of material and it is uneven. There are many good, smart laughs:<br/><br/>Snowball the Psychotic Bunny: ""From now on, YOU WORK FOR ME!""<br/><br/>Max: ""That could be a fun challenge.""<br/><br/>-and:<br/><br/>Pops (an aging Basset Hound): ""Maybe you have time, but for me, every breath is a cliff hanger. So I need to take a short cut."" Pops steps off the edge of a building! <br/><br/>Chloe (unperturbed): ""Okay, so the short cut was death.""<br/><br/>But there are a few scenes, such as a very dark and disturbing interrogation/initiation scene, that miss the mark by a lot. <br/><br/>For me, the second and third acts of the movie were made worthwhile by the character of Gidget, an adorable white ball of fluff with a heart of darkness. Again and again Gidget steps up and drops hell on anyone and anything that blocks her path to her UhmEr, Max. (An UhmEr is a person who you really, really like but about whom you are uncertain of the status of your relationship, as in: ""This is Max, he's my Uhmmm...Errr""). Gidget is the focus of one of the best visual sequences in the movie: When the entire Flushed Pets Gang tries to capture Gidget and the rest of her rescue party, Gidget lets loose her inner Rottweiler in a sequence that owes a great deal to Tex Avery and Chuck Jones. Gidget finishes addressing this problem with an attitude of sincere appreciation for the co-operation of by-standers and victims alike that I found winning and upbeat, and almost made me choke with laughter. GIDGET ROCKS!<br/><br/>Aside from getting me to smile almost constantly from beginning to end, the greatest accomplishment of ""The Secret Life of Pets"" came near the film's close. No spoiler here, but a plot twist involving a major character reversal nearly undid a suspenseful scene until I flipped my switch from cynical to hopeful. I think kids, especially tween-agers will appreciate this scene because it reflects what many of them (if I remember being a tween-ager with reasonable accuracy) believe about friendship. There is a saying: ""A stranger is a friend I haven't made yet,"" and this key plot development speaks to that profound desire. <br/><br/>The above referenced event also sets up one of the most satisfying moments in the movie's epilogue. Any ""Tiny Toons Adventures"" fans out there? If so, you'll probably recognize the homage to Elmyra, the over-enthusiastic pet lover of Tiny Toons fame. Here, Elmyra finally gets the pet that is perfect for her, and for we of the audience, it is a happy moment. <br/><br/>""The Secret Life of Pets"" is not a great movie: I rate it 7 Stars. But it is a fun film with lots to laugh at, so much visual detail that multiple viewings on BluRay are definitely in order, and enough heart to make me glad I'm not too jaded to enjoy it. <br/><br/>OH! And like ""Minions"" last summer, my viewing of ""...Pets"" was preceded by a trailer for Illumination Films next big release, this winter's ""Sing."" I think ""Best Animated Feature"" could be in Illumination's future."
"Quietb-1","7","5","9","8 July 2016"," Dogs rule.
","Here's a movie that they have been promoting for more than a year. One problem is you have seen so much of the movie in various trailers. The only character that didn't seem to make the trailers was the hawk who while looking for Max sounded like he was looking for Nemo. Another problem is the high concept of the secret life of pets but after the premise it is short on story.<br/><br/>It's bright and frenetic. The characters are voiced perfectly with Kevin Hart having the most fun. There is plenty of animal on animal violence but animated animals tend not to get hurt. There is a shameless plug for a future animated movie with a ""Sing"" sign on the bus evolved in a chase.<br/><br/>It is a fun time at the movies and works well on the big screen. There is enough for kids and the adults who will take them. After a strong theatrical run it will play well and entertain the kids at home for a long time."

Having watched Secret Life of Pets, which my children enjoyed very much, I left feeling empty.<br/><br/>We agreed, we wouldn't want to watch it again. It's like a composite of nice through to quite funny animal jokes - mainly visual - strung together with a loose plot (which bears a strong resemblance to Toy Story).<br/><br/>For some reason, which I can't put my finger on, I had no warmth for the characters, their peril and the outcome.<br/><br/>There are also a couple of pieces of peril that I thought were too strong for a U certificate.

It just feels like a cash grab with all the animal films being released (though that may just be me and I'm an idiot and it's always been like this). Can't wait for Sing which looks even worse trying to sell tickets with pop songs years old. I know many people will give Kids films a pass because they are kids films such as this one but that's quite silly, we'd be letting them create generic content and make cash off it because it's targeted towards a demographic who would enjoy most if not any movie with talking cats and dogs. At least they tried."

All is not lost: Max's world is right again when he soon outwits Duke.<br/><br/>A bit later, a man bids goodbye to his French Poodle while departing. The first movement of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons continues playing until the door's fully closed. Deftly using its snout, the poodle replaces the music with the System of a Down song, Bounce. What a dance scene ensues! <br/><br/>Nothing is static for long in this wonderful film. The storytelling truly comes to life when the pets are outside 'their' houses; a new, high-stakes adventure is added to the mix: Max and Duke are now in need of being rescued.<br/><br/>The midpoint occurs as a 'tale of two trips' from Manhattan to Brooklyn (New York has never looked better). For one group of animals, the journey is to save Max and Duke. For the other, it's a hateful act: animals living with humans – such as Max and Duke – are to be disposed of (the villains of the work were previously pets, discarded by their humans).<br/><br/>Though not produced in 3D, the incredible graphics certainly (frequently?) were. Either way, this movie is stunningly gorgeous to the eyes. Alexandre Desplat composed the musical score; he previously earned an Oscar for his score to The Grand Budapest Hotel.<br/><br/>I'm stunned by the completely-dismissive, disconnected reviews of The Secret Life of Pets. While suffering badly with political vertigo, I sought a laugh-fest escape. This film had me howling with laughter.<br/><br/>Far too many critics have forgotten the importance of escapism cinema.

","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. <br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Too many chase scenes detour a good movie down the wrong path.<br/><br/>GRADE: B<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: Pets' private moments (without their owner) get more complicated for two dogs lost in the real world.<br/><br/>The unconditional love and endearing behavior of a pet infuses me with a giddy sense of outright joy. As a life-time pet owner and an avid dog lover, I realize the importance of a four- legged friend in one's life. A pet will bring out your inner child and my latest member to the family, Zoey, is happiness personified. <br/><br/>￼In the animated film, The Secret Life of Pets, animals are personified as well, taking on human traits, especially when their master is away. That is the on-going premise of this film and since I may be a tad biased, as my interest in this film was as comparable as my dog's overwrought joy in getting a new stuffed toy, I have decided to let my intelligent and sensitive pooch handle the reviewing. So....<br/><br/>￼ZOEY'S REVIEW: Hello, dear moviegoers. It's me, Zoey! For those who may not know me, I am a miniature wirehair dachshund with a high I.Q. and I love food, people, playing with toys, and watching cars and movies, in that order. I was asked by my owner, whom I call Daddy Jim, to review a new movie called The Secret Life of Pets, a film that does a disservice to animals in general for spilling the beans about our private moments when you are not around. First off, don't believe it. We are trustworthy creatures who avoid any possible danger. Remember this is not a documentary. It's fiction! That said, I can honestly say that the film was funny and had some nice characters that I enjoyed, especially, the two alpha dogs, Max (Louis C.K.) and Duke (Eric Stonestreet).<br/><br/>￼The story goes like this: One day Max's owner, Katie (Ellie Kemper), brings home a new pet, Duke. Neither are overjoyed with the prospect of sharing their time or attention with their human friend. (I wouldn't either, so already I relate to this situation.) So both go about sabotaging each others' place in the house which leads to problems later.<br/><br/>￼Now some of the shenanigans become too far fetched...did you say fetch?... especially as they are chased by a dog catcher...I know, a cliché....and meet up with a gang of strays led by an angry rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart), who dislike the tamed set...hmm, now that was an interesting development. While I was constantly amused by the movie and thoroughly enjoyed the lovely animation, the screenplay lacked depth and plot development. NO, I wasn't expected Shakespeare, although Hamlet is one of my favorite reads, but I did want something more than one chase after another...and, mind you, I do love to chase rabbits in my yard. (I also did not need a jarring dream sequence that takes place at a meat factory that just doesn't work. Its inclusion gives the film far more filler than any hot dog should endure.)<br/><br/>￼Still The Secret Life of Pets has many humorous moments and captures the movements and nature of animals very well. It also establishes some strong characters with the other critters in the neighborhood, such as Gidget (Jenny Slate), who loves Max so dearly, Chloe, a cat who loves no one but herself (like most cats I know), Tiberius (Albert Brooks), a hawk who continually fights his true hunting instincts, and Buddy (Hannibal Buress), a smooth dachshund to whom I particularly related. as I enjoy his noble breed so much.<br/><br/>￼Now I know animals cannot speak human, even though I am very verbal...just ask my daddy. So I was very surprised to hear the animals converse in English...that is, until I saw the end credits and understood. So, there is good voice-over work by most actors in these roles, particularly Mr. C. K., Mr. Stonestreet, that veteran of voice-overs, Mr. Brooks, and Ms. Bell, although Mr. Hart and Ms. Slate's vocal demands are overdone and too intense for my liking.<br/><br/>￼While the animals in The Secret Life of Pets are not as smart of as sweet as me, they certainly will win you over. The film is fine family entertainment and filled with charm and...oops, gotta go...dinnertime!<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

So they team up with a wise-cracking bunny voiced by Kevin Hart and his crew and the two dogs try to find their way back home in time before Katie comes back. SO will Max and Duke find their way back.<br/><br/>Parts of this film reminded me of Garfield meets Bolt with a hint of Toy Story involved as the whole premise is what do your pets do at home while the owner goes out of their homes.<br/><br/>It was overall a very funny tale and myself and my family all loved it today as we seen in in 3D. Kevin Hart was funny as the bunny rabbit and Jennie Slater(who was the voice of the sheep in Zootopia)was funny as Max's love interest.<br/><br/>If you are a dog or cat lover and you love animated films. Then check it out.<br/><br/>7.5/10<br/><br/>B+<br/><br/>Verdict: Not original but it was a solid film nonetheless."
"gbozoki","2","13","33","15 July 2016"," Not a kids movie and not a good movie
","There may be spoilers in here.<br/><br/>The trailer is great and gives the impression that this would be a light animated movie about pets doing ""stuff"". It never gives much of a glimpse as to what ""stuff"" and there's a good reason for that: once you get past the first 5-6 minutes of the movie (essentieally the entire trailer), you get dropped into a psychotic chase where a gang of blood-thirsty fluffy animals hunt down 2 dogs that get lost from home.<br/><br/>Once the hidden storyline picks up, most characters on screen hit or threaten each other, they manipulate and bully each other, lie to each other, etc. The cute-looking bunny is actually a psychotic ghetto thug that leads the gang and spends the entire movie screaming about killing humans and the 2 dogs.<br/><br/>Other animated movies had cartoon violence in the past (Roadrunner, Tom & Jerry, etc.) but this movie is of a creepy, dark, horror quality with the wrong message for kids. The whole movie is done in very bad taste - another reviewer used the word ""schlock"" and it describes this movie well.<br/><br/>On top of all this, this is a very mediocre movie - there were not one laugh in the theater (which was moderately full) during the whole showing.<br/><br/>If any sane parent saw a glimpse of this, there would be no kids at the theaters so marketing chose to lie to all the customers to lure people in.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this 2 out of 10 is the animation: visually the movie is very well done. Unfortunately, the story is garbage and the visuals cannot save this stinker."

","The Secret Life of Pets uses the cute, comedic premise that pets have their own lives when humans leave for the day. The story follows Max (Louis C.K.) when his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) brings home a much bigger hound, Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Max was previously living a happy life with Katie and his friend: Gidget (Jenny Slate), Chloe (Lake Bell), Buddy (Hannibal Buress), and Mel (Bobby Moynihan). His life is rudely interrupted by his new roommate so he conspires to get rid of him. The two dogs fight and find themselves accosted by cats then captured by Animal Control.<br/><br/>The funniest part of the film is Snowball (Kevin Hart) the white rabbit thrown away by a magician who goes on to lead the legion of flushed pets including gators, cats, lizards, and a tattooed pig. The flushed animals seek revenge against the human race for being discarded and this is the closest the film gets to delivering any sort of message. <br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
"chrisholton86","7","3","5","3 September 2016"," Great but lacking depth
","Good fun and great for kids and families, but lacking in depth. The voice overs and animation are fantastic! I think the narrative dealt with the amount of characters well, however, opportunities to explore characters in more detail were missed. My biggest criticism is that the film ended sharply, quickly patching together the rivalry between various characters as though nothing had happened - again, not bad as a family film, and lets face it, not many people are watching TSLoP as intellectual stimulus, but it left me feeling a bit ripped off. Overall a top family film that was a lot of fun, but could have delivered so much more."
"polaris2006","1","20","60","10 July 2016"," Creepy
","There is something really creepy and bizarre about this movie, that suppose to be for children? I felt like being in some hypnotic brainwashing session. It stars and ends in a funny and benevolent way, but somewhere in the middle it takes a weird turn, with very little or no taste.<br/><br/>So if you think this move is like described in the trailer about how cute pets are and crazy things they do, you're wrong. Middle movie plot: Psychotic evil bunny wants to destroy a human race and ask the main character: How did you kill your human? Did you blender it? Give us the details! etc. Then there are some cult/ritualistic initiation stuff with the snake (?). There is drowning and near death experience. And lots of violence. Seriously? Isn't this too harsh, I mean there were 5, 6, 7 year old kids watching it.<br/><br/>And then the racist elements: Ghetto thug bunny speaks like a black man, of course (I'm white btw). But main characters are white dog and white fluffy girly dog - that speaks very fancy - just like white rich people.<br/><br/>This movie seriously lucks creativity and warmth and humanity. I just felt I was deceived by the plot summary and trailer and would certainly not watch it if I knew that."

It's absolutely dark and twisted. These writers must be on drugs when they write the stories. No wonder children are more violent and disturb these days.

","This was weak. I took my 7 year old and he thought Angry Birds was better. First off I wasn't impressed by the story line, it really didn't feel like the writers had thought about the end goal from the beginning and so it felt like it was crashing from one scene to the next - few of the scene felt like they really belonged in the film they were just put there as an excuse. I thought this was going to be more about the life of pets but then we get this revolutionary lot and I just don't think they fitted the story well it was like everything was crow-barred in. On the good side the animation was good, but some of the jokes, they got tiresome now and again. A lot of the action scenes I felt I'd seen before in other films."
"chaos-rampant","Null","4","8","30 March 2017"," Pelts, no secret life
","I saw this together with the latest from Pixar. Both are animated, feature talking animals making crazy getaways and trying to retrieve loved ones, so you might think they're going to be somewhat in the same ballpark. How significantly lesser can one be? Let's see.<br/><br/>Pixar begin with small, memorable pockets of world that they expand, pulling back to reveal larger vistas. The effort is to have the narrative expansion in as much visually flowing ways. There is thoughtful engineering to this flowing; sequences have been choreographed and given room to unfold. There is an element of discovery. Characters retain a certain human gravity in their wants.<br/><br/>These guys just plop us here and there. The place is an unimaginative New York, simply digitized, poorly discovered. The unveiling of the larger world leaves us with an animal mob in the sewers plotting revenge. Sequences, ostensibly the very same chase scenes, are choppy and without any flow. We just bump on a bunch of things on our way out. Characters are sketchy, one is a wimp, the other is a bully, then we change them around to be caring. The hawk as villainous predator then our hero's girlfriend tells him they could be friends, so as of right now he wants to help.<br/><br/>We're talking levels of difference between Singin' in the Rain and an SNL skit that features song and dance.<br/><br/>And do you ever get the impression some movies simply have lame personality? I find this usually in how characters are presented, in the change of heart they have, in how they pursue what is deemed important. Oddly I never seem to notice the opposite in movies that engage me. Even when I disagree with what I'm being presented with by Noe or Trier but I'm being engaged by a view of the world, not a personality. It seems a certain kind of bad movie reduces the exchange to how things rub me, not having been conceived to do anything else. Well, this is one."

","Louis returns with The Secret Life of pets with a great characters I know why it is the highest grossing movie this month. The movie has some big name stars like Kevin Hart the only thing wrong is that it copy toy story. Even with that it has some good animation for the production lineup when it was announced. Even though it copy toy story It has a good story for example Max hates duke with a twist. And his friends can not find max with a twist he was in the sewers. But its weakness is some acting into the movie like the hot dog part for me. It was a good that the company took a break for minions and something great for the company.

"f-montalto","6","4","8","11 July 2016"," Review from my 6 year old
","My 6 year old had been very much looking forward to seeing this movie since the first trailer came out about a year ago. She loves animals and laughed through the preview trailer many many times. After seeing the movie opening weekend, and laughing maybe one or two times at a joke that she hadn't previously seen in the trailer, she announced, ""If you're going to make a trailer all cute and funny, then you should make the MOVIE cute and funny too, sickos!"" <br/><br/>Couldn't have said it better myself. I will add that she labeled the movie sad and scary and said it was her least favorite of these types of movies. But she laughed all the way through the Minion mini-movie. Maybe the writers would do well to pay attention to their intended audience."

","When I first saw the trailer the first thing I said was ""I think I'm totally sold by this movie."" because I'm a pet lover and when I was a kid I'm always said to myself what pets do when we are not at home or what they are thinking about us.<br/><br/>The Secret life of Pets is all about Max and his animal friends. Max (Louis C.K) is a terrier dog living quietly with Katie (Ellie Kemper) his owner. But the happy life of Max and his friends are interrupted by Duke (Eric Stonestreet) a large, brown shaggy mongrel. Max get jealous to Duke because Katie have a larger focus on Duke. So Duke tricks Max into the city because Max do not have a big city experience and they both caught by Animal Control but they both rescued by a rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart) the leader of ""The Flushed Pets"", a cult who hates humans.<br/><br/>Yep I spoil you but not enough because as you can see the plot is the same plot to Toy Story when Buzz Lightyear introduce to Woody and friends so the adventure begins so as you can see when Duke introduced to Max the adventure begins too! <br/><br/>The first 25 minutes showed potential but it was all down hill from there and all the funny things about this movie were included in the trailer so no surprise at all..<br/><br/>The Secret Life of Pets is fun for kids; but missing is that emotional sting where no matter your age.<br/><br/>2 over 5 stars The Secret Life of Pets is not for big boys and they should rename it ""The Pet Story"" it would be better that way!"
"evanston_dad","5","5","11","9 August 2016"," Lazy and Uninspired
","One doesn't fully appreciate a really good animated film until one sees a mediocre one.<br/><br/>It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that animated films don't need to be kept to the same standard as movies for adults, because kids will be happy with so much less. But compare ""The Secret Life of Pets,"" a serviceable but lackluster film, to something from Pixar, say, or the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" series, and one is less inclined to forgive the creators of ""Pets"" for being so lazy.<br/><br/>The idea of the social life that pets carry on with each other while their owners are away is a good one and could provide plenty of material for a wonderful film, but this movie instead goes for the hard sell approach and creates an overly-complicated plot mostly lacking in wit, giving us too many characters doing too many things, none of which we care much about. The voice work is adequate and uninspired, like the rest of the film, and it's a real liability that the voices of the two main characters (Louis C.K. and Eric Stonestreet) who start off as rivals and end up as pals, sound too much alike.<br/><br/>Grade: C"
"subxerogravity","7","5","11","8 July 2016"," The secret is out, and it's a fun imaginative story for everyone, not just the kids.
","But that's the way these movies are going these days, the Secret Life of Pets is design to get everyone to buy a ticket (especially those who own pets), but I do feel this movie is more catered to get adults in those seats. Of course you can bring your children, cause nothing in the movie is not for children, but the clean jokes are mostly focus to an older crowd (or a crowd of pet owners)<br/><br/>I'm hoping no child out there knows who Luis CK is, other than his own children. I think this is the first time the kids will hear the voice of Luis CK. The opening monologue was very similar to something that Luis CK would talk about in his comedy routine (Just less grim and raunchy). As the character of Max, a small terrier, he tells us what it's like to be a pet, and from his perceptive it's more like being roommates with your best friend, but in reality he's more like a child who when the parents go away, he and the other children cause mischief when they are all unsupervised. Max's life gets turned upside down when his owner brings home yet another dog named Duke (awesome name for a dog by the way). I understand how Max feels. I'm sure it does happen with dog lovers, but me personally, I've never known a person who already owned a dog in New York City to go out and get another dog three times the size of the tiny dog you have for your above average sized New York Apartment (that she gets to live in alone cause whenever she leaves to the place Max does not know and does not understand why she leaves, she must be making a lot of money from it (She does have a T-shirt from a college I could not read, but it must have been a good one). Two cats, Yes, but two dogs!?<br/><br/>Anyway, in both Max and Duke's attempts to get rid of one another they end up getting captured by animal control and escape with the help of a psychopath bunny name Snowball who leads a rebellion of animals that were ""flushed"" away by their owners (Apart of the crew is two Crocodile who live in the sewer confirming the urban legend). This is where the adventure begins as Max and Duke go on adventure from Central Park to Brooklyn and back again in an attempt to find home and their friends from the apartment complex lead by Gidget, who has a huge crush on Max (but Max barely knows she's alive) plan a rescue attempt when they find him missing. <br/><br/>The animation is just OK, nothing mind blowing about the character designs, but the back ground layouts were actually pretty cool to look at. The animation is used more so as a tool for what is an excellent story of adventure and odd friendships. <br/><br/>The pets where as unique in personality as any resident filled Manhattan apartment complex. <br/><br/>Louis CK was almost out shined by Kevin Hart as a tiny bunny called Snowball, a psychotic animal who was abandoned by his owner to become leader of a rebellion for abandon pets. Hart was at his funniest in this movie, Just so on point. Kevin Hart also had a starring role in the movie Central Intelligence this summer, and he was nowhere near as funny in that one as he was in this. If you are a fan of Hart's, you better off watching him play a voice in this movie. <br/><br/>Another character I really liked (other than that poodle whose a huge fan of System of a Down) was Tiberius, a hawk trying to hold back his predator urge in order to help his new (and only) friend, Gidget find Max. It was kinda odd hearing Albert Brooks voice come out of the character. Not odd like his role in Drive, but odd in the fact that I just saw (herd) him in as Marlin in Finding Dory that came out a few weeks before.<br/><br/>The Secret Life of Pets has a lot of cool charters I should mention, but that's a long list. However, I got to give a shout out to Chloe. If you are a cat lover ( I am) than you are going to love her, she is the absolute best. <br/><br/>The 3D was worth it. Items came popping out but not for no reason like most 3D movies. Basically, it feels like they planed the 3D from day one rather than adding it on afterwards to try to milk extra dollars out of us. Once again pointing out a great story happening in the movie, that does not need 3D as a gimmick for you to go out and see it.<br/><br/>Plus, like most animated blockbusters, you get a short at the beginning before the feature. This short stars the Minions in a funny tale of the crew trying to raise money to buy something needlessly sold to them on TV.<br/><br/>So, Yeah, if you have kids take them, If you don't, It's still a worth wild movie to checkout, but I think you'll have to leave your pets at home (although after seeing this movie you might not want to)<br/><br/>http://cinemagardens.com/"

"cherold","8","2","3","27 November 2016"," So much fun
","I heard good things about this movie, but then I read some of the IMDb reviews and got worried that this would be too much of a kiddy movie. But nope, this is absolutely great.<br/><br/>It's made by the same people who did the terrific Despicable Me films, and like those, it's very funny and pumps out one gag after another in quick succession. The movie manages to both catch real qualities of animals, like cats that will bite then lick you, and goofy nonsensical things like an angry bunny leading a stray revolution.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, particularly Kevin Hart as the aforementioned bunny and Ellie Kemper and Lake Bell as two of the protagonists' friends.<br/><br/>The story is little more than an excuse for a lot of gags, but it works.<br/><br/>Some people are complaining this movie is too violent for kids. When I was a kid, Bugs Bunny would hand Daffy Duck a bomb that caused his bill to come off, so I have trouble taking the violence complaint seriously. It's got some action-movie fisticuffs and a bit of suspense, but I see nothing wrong with that. It's fun."

"stuartthomasart","7","2","3","22 November 2016"," Entertaining but hardly ground-breaking.
","Watched The Secret Life of Pets last night. A story you could write on a postage stamp but with some genuine laugh out loud moments and some good voice characterisations. It didn't have any of the mawkish sentimentality that some cartoons manage to devolve into and the action barely let up throughout. Not one I'd want to keep (although there's a lot of background stuff going on that might warrant a second or third viewing) but certainly good for a rental. The animation, as you would expect, was superb with the city backgrounds looking stunning and the characters having great expression and movement. One thing does niggle at me though. It was obvious that the screenplay was thrown together using the ""draw elements from the hat"" method and, while they certainly lead to a few laughs, there were a few points that didn't quite gel with the internal logic of the film. I know it's just a cartoon but still, these things jar and it smacks of lazy writing. What these cartoons do really well, though, is slapstick and there's some great moments of that in this. To sum up: Great for the kids and with a few nice touches for adults to enjoy but not a great deal of substance."

","Well, there could be little doubt about that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" was going to be a hit, and it turned out to be a very enjoyable movie for both kids and adults alike.<br/><br/>The story is about what goes on in the lives of pets once their owners go out the front door and leave the pets home alone. Max, a small well-groomed terrier, gets stuck with Duke, a massive shaggy dog, and have to go out on his life adventure as a mad rabbit named Snowball and his army of discarded pets are about to make life miserable for people, as part of their revenge on their former owners.<br/><br/>It is a combination of many things that add up to make ""The Secret Life of Pets"" a good movie.<br/><br/>First of all, the animation, which was really great. The characters and environments were all so dynamic and fantastic to look at; with lots of detail and personal touches to them.<br/><br/>Secondly, the storyline which was a compelling one that appealed to both children and grown-ups alike. There are many good aspects to the storyline portrayed in ""The Secret Life of Pets"", so there is something for everyone here.<br/><br/>And also the characters, whom were all very lovable in their own way, and each character was a distinct and individual character, which also added depth to the movie.<br/><br/>The voice acting, which is a crucial factor for an animated movie, was great. And they had some good talents to fill the various roles in this animated movie.<br/><br/>I was more than genuinely entertained and surprised with how good and enjoyable that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" turned out to be. And if you enjoy animated movies then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch ""The Secret Life of Pets"" if you get the chance. I will say that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is actually right up alongside with ""The Good Dinosaur""."

Gathering up Christmas presents,I was happy to learn that Illumination's newest creation has just come out on DVD,which led to me getting ready to meet some minion pets.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Loyal to his owner Kate, Jack Russell Terrier Max spends the day waiting by the door for Kate to return to her apartment. As Max waits by the door,his friends in the apartment block Chloe (tabby cat), Mel (pug),dachshund Buddy and budgerigar Sweetpea come round to hang out with him.Returning home one night,Kate reveals that she has purchased a new,big shaggy dog called Duke. Jealous of Duke possibly taking his spot, Max tries to throw Duke out of the house,but ends up getting in a fight with Duke,and rolling out with him. Untying their tails,Max and Duke are horrified to find that they no longer know where they are.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Whilst cutting down on some of the mad-cap Comedy antics of Minions,the screenplay by Cinco Paul/Ken Daurio/Brian Lynch & Simon Rich hold the leads to character comedy that sparkles with a feline zest,from the harsh sewer underworld filled with very funny ""thug"" rabbits and snakes,to dogs secretly moshing to heavy metal music. Although they are unable to fully escape the shadow of Pixar's most famous toys,the writers do give the buddy comedy between Max and Duke a fresh coat,thanks to a light comedic tone being kept under their claws.<br/><br/>Peeking into the window of each apartment to see a pet leaping in joy at their owners return,directors Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud shake the fur with glowing primary colours which make each of the slick, distinctly designed animals bounce across the screen. Taking advantage of the excellent vocal work from Louis C.K./ Eric Stonestreet and Zootopia's Jenny Slate,the directors follow Max and Duke round in gliding camera moves which crisply capture the fur ball sight gags rolling in the background,as Max and Duke try to get back to their secret lives as Kate's pets."

","The Secret Life of Pets is an animated adventure comedy movie directed by Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney. It stars the voices of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Steve Coogan, Ellie Kemper, Bobby Moynihan, Lake Bell, Dana Carvey, Hannibal Buress, Jenny Slate, and Albert Brooks. The movie follows Max, a dog who lives as a pet with his owner and enjoys everyday with her. That is until the owner brings in another pet named Duke who Max has some problems with. I very much liked this film, it is a fun colorful animated flick with a very talented voice cast and some very good laughs along the way. It is interesting and has a very good concept, despite it being similar to Toy Story. But it totally works in favor of the film as it does hold our interest until the end with likable, yet underdeveloped, characters that any pet owner will fall in love with. It is not perfect however as it has many apparent flaws, as I already mentioned it is very similar to Toy Story and it borrows a lot from it. The side characters are just there really, they don't do much and we get to know very little about them throughout the entirety of the film. But all in all, this is a hit for Illumination who surely know how to make those numbers at the box office huge every single time. Imagine this movie even surpassed Inside Out at the domestic gross and it holds the highest opening record for an original movie ever, again surpassing a much better film - Inside Out, which is insane to think about."

The two go out one of those days when the owner is out and a spiral of events lands them in the midst of a notorious ""sewer"" gang of rodents, alligators, cats, a pig, viper and an alpha bunny.

","It has the same script,with a few changes.<br/><br/>Max is a happy dog who enjoys his life with his owner when suddenly his owner brings another dog into the house, Garfield, um sorry , max, struggles with the new roommate, gets really possessive and tries to kick him out o the house, blah blah blah. They both end up in the street, and they have to cooperate in order to survive as they face , wild animals, and escape shelter... In the end of course things work out between them and they become friends. However I have to admit it was a fun movie, despite the snakes,(I literally can't stand them) and was kind of moving especially in the part when duke finds out his owner is dead. Also this movie gives a lesson about relationships, and how a second child , in the family won't affect the love his parent have for the first one.<br/><br/>7/10 quite good"
"EthanBJones_03","7","2","3","21 August 2016"," Great movie that is a refreshing break from the Minions
","Overall: I liked this movie more than I did't like it but I don't feel it is better than Despicable Me.<br/><br/>Good: Each and every character feels cool and unique. They are all fun and have superb voice acting. Quite a bit of the humour hit for me but I could see children bursting out with laughter near me. The cinematography was pretty good and the music was decent. It would be a great movie for kids. The ending is very well done and makes you feel good inside.<br/><br/>Bad: Not all the humour hits for me and the best parts are shown in the trailer. Some pacing issues but nothing to be concerned about.<br/><br/>Best Part: The ending were everyone is happy and Kevin Hart gets a new home.<br/><br/>7/10"

","We all know that animated movies are getting better one after another. So I expected it to be very good. So is not what I expected, but the movie is still a decent one. I really makes you think about your pets and friendship. The ending of all the owners getting to the house and the pets reaction was great. I wish that they would've made more fun of dogs and peculiar things that they do. I did not like how big duke was. It was an abnormally furry and big dog. I think that the hawk was very good. The colors and the view of New York was awesome and colorful. The sausage scene was a little too crazy. There is still a lot of value in this movie that you learn athing or two."

Honestly I did not have much expectations coming in to this film expecting an average cute movie but it's better than that. I overall had a fun time with this film. This was a cool movie with characters that are cool two see and I see myself seeing and buying it on Blue ray because it's a good film to see I think. I think I would love to call this a class.

","Not a children's movie at all. My husband and I walked out after the first 30 minutes of the movie. And we weren't the only people who walked out! A little boy left distraught from what he heard and saw on the movie screen. We were disturbed at how incredibly dark the content was for being a children's movie. From what we saw there was not much humor and violence reigned. The movie took a strange turn when a big stray dog interrupted the life of the main dog & the two encountered an animal gang. The gang had a rite of passage and wanted to share gruesome details on killing humans. This movie was over the top in violent thinking especially for a kids movie. It also appeared to have a political agenda behind it. I am thankful we didn't bring our son to the movie. We would NEVER bring our children to watch this movie! I wouldn't recommend this for any family."
"hsp-54868","7","1","1","4 August 2019"," This movie is great but It's too similar to Toy Story...
","... Wanna know why this movie is similar to TS?? 1. Both Owners get a new toy/dog that they love and the owners neglect the old toy/dog and the old toy/dog hates the new toy/dog. 2. Both of the two toys/dogs get stuck with each other and get lost and try to find a way back to their owners. 3. Both of the toys/pets can talk or come to life when their owners aren't looking or to other toys/pets. 4. I know this has happened in many other films before, but a romantic subplot between Woody and Bo/Max and Gidget. Thats all I could think of. Oh we have the characters that seem to act similar to the characters we see in TS. Max=Woody Duke=Buzz Gidget=Bo Peep Snowball=Presumably Sid?? and Katie=Andy. This movie has some funny and inappropriate jokes for example we see the antagonist Snowball laughing maniacally and then craps all over the floor on screen and we see a cat playing with the crap. Some material in this film may not seem suitable for children such as Snowball saying he wants to murder the owners and other humans, The Van falling off the Brooklyn Bridge and into the water and Snowball and Max trying to escape, and that huge snake coming out of the pipe and being crushed by piles of bricks. Overall, I give this a 7/10."

","Most movies these days are OK. Animation has become the vehicle of this moment. There was a time when we would be stunned by the incredible use of the animators craft. But once computers and their technicians go into the act and there was so much to watch, we needed something to stand out. While this is a movie about rivalries and being happy with what we have, there is no sparkle to it. There is just a lot of intense action and no reality to peak of. Yes, I did say reality. The anthropomorphic figures here need to be stunning. We've seen the chases and the splats and the tiresome human traits that have been done so often. I had not trouble watching and enjoying parts of this, but as a whole with a direction, it comes up rather short."

If you like nonsensical, violent, animated movies then you can get a lot out of this. Its basically just like 90 minutes of animals running around beating each other up and dream sequences.

","This film should have been called Pet Story. I definitely enjoyed watching it, but there's no arguing the plot similarities with Toy Story. It's good, but not nearly as good. The deeper messages in Pixar films are effectively expressed through some sort of conclusive compathy among the characters. That's what really brings it home in those Pixar films that other animated films often lack. When there's a collective sentiment (good or bad) among the characters in the end, rather than just empathy, it unifies everything. It's more than just trying to relate with a character. Many times, that separates the good films from the great ones. This is one of those films that holds up well and you could watch twice, but there is nothing here to catapult it to that holy realm where Toy Story, WALL-E, Inside Out, etc. reside. With that said, it was cute and funny, the action sequences were solid and I had no complaints with the voices. And I really liked the chestburster gag with the iguana! 6.5/10 — ￼watching The Secret Life Of Pets."

"Animated_Antic","7","1","1","24 April 2017"," A very, very, very bizarre and crazy film.
","I am at a lost for words. No, I'm not kidding. I honestly don't know what to say about ""The Secret Life of Pets."" I decided to watch it for one reason or another, and I'm just left in shock by what I just watched. Oh, not because it's bad or anything, on the contrary. This movie is just absolutely bizarre! It makes no sense! It left me feeling so confused that I don't know what to say. Yeah, I'm not kidding. This movie, ""The Secret Life of Pets"", is so random, so odd, and makes very little to no sense, is just absolutely insane that it I'm still speechless. The movie is in no way near as good as Illumination Entertainment's other movie series ""Despicable Me"". Those movies actually tried to be movies. They told stories that made sense. This doesn't, yet it's so enjoyable because of how strange it is. I'll try to tell the story as best as I can because trust me. It's really something!<br/><br/>So, in New York City, when owners of pets leave the house, the animals do whatever they want. They do things you expect pets to do when you leave the house. However one dog named Max (Louis C.K.) just sits by the door and waits for his owner Katie to come home. However, one day, she comes home but with another dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Instantly, Max gets jealous of him and wants him out of house (I mean apartment). So, after being taken to the dog park, the two get in a fight and get lost in the city far away from the comfort of their home. And now, here's where things get strange. Okay, so they get thrown into an alley where a bunch of cats are and get their collars stolen which leads to them getting captured by animal catcher which leads to a bunch of animals led by a bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart) breaking into the truck to rescue one of their allies for their gang the Flushed Pets which leads to Max and Duke asking to be broken out which leads to them escaping into the sewer, but not before the animal control truck blows up. And that's only a few minutes of the insanity that is in this movie.<br/><br/>I'll say the things I did get from this ""movie"" before I talk about my opinion on the insane story. I did like the animation as I do in all of Illumination's movies. It's bright and colorful. I also like Kevin Hart's character Snowball. He's this weird devilish rabbit planning to overthrow the humankind because he was abandoned by his previous owner. The voice acting is good from the others, except for two. Both Jenny Slate's and Albert Brook's voices stood out like a sore thumb as I kept thinking of their better animated movies they were in last year (Slate was in ""Zootopia"" while Brooks was in ""Finding Dory""). Now, let me talk about my opinion on the story. At first, I didn't like it because of how unlikable the main characters were. Then, the movie just spiraled out off control into this madness which involves a crazy bus chase, a car exploding, a weird party that the pets are having, and a totally confusing sausage factory scene. Yeah, it is that crazy of a movie. And personally I kind of like the insanity! Not a lot, but I thought it was very out there and odd that it was fun watching.<br/><br/>So, as a whole ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a really mixed bag. It has both good and bad, but it's the story that had the big impact.  It's one crazy mixed up story, that I liked for the some of the insanity. I honestly thought it was sort of enjoyable for how nuts it was, but I don't know if I would watch it again. So, if you're expecting a nice, funny, animated comedy with animals, you won't find it here. But if you like a movie that is so insane, so crazy, and just totally nuts that you'll have fun questioning what you saw, then this movie's for you."
"mwcrunner","7","1","1","6 March 2017"," Pretty good and cute film here
","This film is cute and funny here. It has really cute and fluffy characters in it and very good voice acting, especially from Albert Brooks who was that vulture that tried to eat Gidget, but was chained and then decided to help Gidget find Max and Duke who were held captive by that rabbit Snowball and all the rest of those lost and abandoned pets. Yep Max and Duke go on an adventure in order to get back to their owner after Duke finds out his old owner had died. Also the sausage scene had the song We Go Together from the movie Grease. which I didn't notice until now. Also Grease is still a classic. Anyway this story is a story about friendship and that the two dogs Max and Duke learn to get along after going on a long journey and this is nowhere similar to Toy Story. It's just a different story of friendship. 7 out of 10 for this. Enough said."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","6 January 2017"," A Cheerful, Harmless & Family-Friendly Distraction
","From the creators of Despicable Me, The Secret Life of Pets is another barely serviceable feature film to come out from Illumination Studios' canon following their billion dollar-grossing & insufferably pathetic Minions and although it caters well to the needs of its target audience, it remains a highly generic & downright mediocre adventure comedy.<br/><br/>Taking place in a Manhattan apartment building, the story of The Secret Life of Pets follows a terrier whose perfect life is uprooted when his owner brings another dog into the house. Although unable to get along at first, the two are compelled to put their differences aside after discovering a sinister plot put together by a horde of lost or abandoned pets.<br/><br/>Directed by Chris Renaud & Yarrow Cheney, the movie opens with a brief segment that showcases what pets do once their owners have left for work and it is genuinely funny. The animation is rich & colourful, characters are brilliantly designed & rendered, and it offers a heathy dose of amusement with its fluffy humour but the laughs are usually present in moments that are trivial to its plot.<br/><br/>There are moments that are hilarious as hell while it is barely moving on other occasions. Plenty of characters occupy the screen over the course of its runtime but not a single one of them exhibit an interesting enough arc. The voice actors do well with what they're given, pacing is never an issue, camera-work is finely carried out and it is nicely supported by Alexandre Desplat's gleeful score.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Secret Life of Pets offers a passable family-friendly entertainment and at times exhibits clever use of wit but there is absolutely nothing about it that makes it stand out from the crowd. A slight improvement over Illuminated Entertainment's billion dollar-grossing, headache inducing Minions, it offers a cheerful, harmless & amusing distraction that's meant to be forgotten the moment it ends."
"Reno-Rangan","7","1","1","14 November 2016"," Street pets versus the house pets! A day adventure in a big city!
","Animation films always fascinate me, because of its varieties. Even animals can be the heroes and villains. So this kind of new story perspective, including technology, what makes adults too can enjoy them like the kids does. This is now in the list of top 50 highest grossing films of all time and top 10 of the year 2016. Moreover, it is the highest grossing non Disney and non Pixar animation film. This is a very enjoyable family flick that directed by the 'Despicable Me' famed filmmaker.<br/><br/>Kind of similar to 'Bolt', but totally a different experience. This story happens in just one day. It follows a young dog named Max, one day when his owner brings another pet dog, he thinks she does not love him anymore. So to keep his position safe in the house, he strikes a deal by blackmailing his new housemate, Duke. As a revenge act, when Duke tries to get him back, something goes wrong and they get stranded on the street. So getting back to home is their biggest challenge and it should be done before the sun sets. The rest is the Max and Duke's a day adventure in the New York City.<br/><br/>I was not expecting a masterpiece, just the last week I saw one, 'Finding Dory'. This is a good entertainer, that has some great names in the voice-over cast. Particularly you will love Kevin Hart like I did. But watch out for his impolite dialogues, if you are watching with your kids. Though there's nothing seriously affecting, just a typical Kevin Hart, but awesome. A simple story, a simple adventure, but very likable characters and screen presentation.<br/><br/>From the pets' perspective about during the daytime when their owners and the kids left for the work and school, respectively, how they make their day is what's revealed in this. So the 'Secret Life' means, theirs secret get together and do whatever they want to. But an unexpected clash takes place between the two gangs, the house pets and the street pets. In so many ways, it was better than I anticipated. There are lots of untold stuffs, especially the Duke's past which might be covered in the sequel which is officially announced now. So I'm waiting for the 2018 summer. Meanwhile, watch it if you haven't yet, particularly if you like animation.<br/><br/>7/10"
"DavidLindahl","6","1","1","5 October 2016"," The Toy Story of animals
","The Secret Life of Pets is about pets and their world. Just like in Toy Story, the animals can speak and have a life of their own when the humans aren't looking or are away at work. The dog Max is living a quiet life with his owner Katie. One day she gets a bigger dog called Duke and immediately they start to fight to win her love. After having argued and fought out on a walk, Max and Duke gets lost in the underworld and meets other animals that don't live a fancy pet life like they do.<br/><br/>The Secret life of Pets is a film like many other animal films and yet it succeeds in entertaining in a charming way by taking us on an adventure where we get to see life from their side. Films like Oliver & Company, Babe and Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey, comes to mind. Animal films are far from new and often contain a worn out story but despite this The Secret Life of Pets really delivers. I think one of the films central elements is the balance in the humor. There is clarity in the dialogue that is easy for children to understand, but there is also another dimension clearly meant for adults. This is often the thing that family films are having difficulties with, to be appealing for both children and adults. The latest Ice Age film that I reviewed here did not succeed in this. The other thing that I really think is the key to the success of this film is the tempo. With its one hour and 27 minutes, the film is not really that long but the time is well disposed and few scenes contains unnecessary things. It also makes us the audience wanting to see more of these animals when the film is over. I am not so sure that we would want that, had the film been 20 minutes longer and slower.<br/><br/>The characters in the film is well thought out and shaped to fit this kind of road movie where someone travels forward. They usually include some sort of leader, someone who is a little stupid, someone who is a bit dangerous and also someone who is cocky and perhaps too brave. The Secret Life of Pets has all of these characters and also a villain, a white bunny. Perhaps a hint to Monty Python's evil bunny in the The Holy Grail and also ironic because a bunny is usually seen as cute and harmless. Quite fun, much due to Kevin Hart's great voice acting. The film summarizes itself well towards the end with several morale plot parts. Don't judge people (in this case animals) based on their appearance, comradeship, the ability to share and also that certain things that you want are often found right in front of you if you just look close enough. Definitely good messages for a family film, very often already told, but if delivered properly and in a new way like here in The Secret Life of Pets, they are worth telling several times over again.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"
"drqshadow-reviews","8","1","1","3 October 2016"," Wholesome, Witty, Tail-Wagging Family Fun
","Cute laughs for the whole family; a hair on the light side, but given the broad audience that's understandable. Warm fuzzies abound, and not just in the physical sense. Beyond the sight gags and puns, both calling cards of Illumination Entertainment (the studio behind Despicable Me), it offers a big heart and a fresh spin on a rather familiar saga. Like an urban, modern, madcap Incredible Journey from several perspectives, it's a winding road with many unexpected bumps. It's also well-stocked with voice talent - Louis CK, Kevin Hart, Albert Brooks, Hannibal Buress - and does a fine job of letting the bigger personalities do their thing, taking over a scene when they need to. Lots of fun when it lingers on the quirks and perks that any dog or cat owner should know by heart, and also surprisingly sweet when it comes time to wrap everything up and move on to the credits. A firm, solid entry."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","1","1","2 October 2016"," Worth a watch especially if you have / had pets
","When growing up as a kid, there's almost a 100% guarantee that at some point a parent will here their child ask for a pet. Whether it's a gold fish, cat, dog, ferret, frog, rabbit, snail or whatever, humans have been domesticating animals for quite some time. There's just something about our pets that we enjoy. The fact that they share and display similar emotions to that of us is so heart warming. They all might express them in different ways but most owners know or understand what their fuzzy friends are feeling. However this is the only thing we comprehend about them on a personal level. They can't speak to us in our native tongue or vise versa and we have no clue what they do behind our backs or how they feel in the moment. When left up to the minds behind Despicable Me (2010) though, viewers will get a completely different perception. Will it make us think differently in what our pets do behind our backs to this extreme - no. But will it let us come up with crazy ideas as to what could happen - of course.<br/><br/>This spin off series that runs parallel to the Despicable Me (2010) universe was directed by Yarrow Cheney (his theatrical debut) and Chris Renaud (Despicable Me (2010)). Three writers also collaborated on the script, that being Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch (Hop (2011)). The story follows Max (Louis C.K.), a puppy with a good life. His owner took him who found him when he was a baby and gave him everything to his hearts content. Things were great. Then unbeknownst to Max, his owner comes home with another dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Feeling a bit slighted, Max and Duke end up learning that you have to give in order to get. Within that conflict the two end up crossing paths with Snowball (Kevin Hart), an eccentric bunny rabbit whose main goal in life is to overthrow the human race for his fellow abandoned pets. All the while, Max's secret love interest Gidget (Jenny Slate) hopes to gain his affection at some point in time but she's not sure how. Nevertheless she's very determined to make it happen.<br/><br/>The development among characters is proportional to the significance each role has. Through several experiences both Duke and Max learn a lot about themselves. Backstories are given for each, which is why their development works. What's even more effective is how many viewers can relate because of comparable life experiences. Gidget as a love interest isn't written so cliché either. The idea itself is rather turned on its head and that's not seen very frequently. As for Snowball, he doesn't have incredibly deep development but his background is made apparent. For the rest of the supporting characters, there aren't too many complaints to have. The only character that doesn't really have a clear motivation is Tiberius (Albert Brooks) the hawk. According to Tiberius, he's sad to have no friends because his owner locks him away in a cage at the top of an apartment. Yet later on, audiences will see Tiberius being petted by his owner and they seem to be enjoying each other's company,...so why is he upset again?<br/><br/>The other blatant problem in the story's writing is Max's owner and every other pet's owner for that matter. Apparently this whole movie plays out within a day's time. Throughout the running time, Max and company go through a lot of locations in the city. Some not as clean as others. Yet somehow nobody smells his or her pet has been anywhere but home. Surely somebody's pet would be coming off foul somewhere. What are the odds that they remained clean the whole time? That's about as preposterous as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's role in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) where her white dress did not get one smudge. Also the title is a bit misleading. The adventure the main leads go on is nothing that secret. There a few secret like activities that take place throughout the film, but much of it is so out in the open. Aside from this though the comedy and actor chemistry all blend well together. Both Louis C.K. and Eric Stonestreet practically sound like brothers and Kevin Hart makes Snowball likable and hilarious all at once.<br/><br/>The other supporting character that has a number of great lines and best fits her role is Lake Bell as Chloe the cat. So much of her responses and sarcasm are exactly how many cat owners would expect their cat to react to certain situations. The animation is also enjoyable feature. Heading the animation is Salem Arfaoui as senior animator. Arfaoui has been a senior animator going all the way back with 9 (2009) while also participating in Despicable Me (2010), The Lorax (2012) and Despicable Me 2 (2013). The musical score on the other hand was okay but nothing outstanding. Composed by Alexandre Desplat, the music is appropriate to the surroundings with real orchestral instruments but there's no reoccurring theme for the audience to remember. Especially if this is being planned as another franchise, there should be a main theme too. This is what really helps solidify the characters and story. Desplat was also the composer to Unbroken (2014), Godzilla (2014) and The Imitation Game (2014). Especially for such big films, one would expect something.<br/><br/>Definitely an entertaining family movie for all ages. It's strongest point is that it can relate to almost any viewer because of how frequently we as a human race go through pets in our lives. The writing is mostly well balanced with a few questionable tidbits. The music isn't truly memorable but the actors and animation are fun to watch."

"captainmike-michael","7","1","1","6 September 2016"," Charming but Lack of Originality
","Part I: Film The latest presentation from Illumination brings audiences a whole new bunch of adorable animals mimicking Pixar's Toy Story but in an overly familiar blended Zootopia/ Finding Dory story line. While lacks of originality and inspiring emotional engagement, it is still a simple, straight forward story lifted by its fast pacing adventure, bloated with ridiculous fantasy and constant charms that are whole-heartedly fun for animal lovers. Characters development is slightly thin due to variety of pets introduced but the film works well in its smaller moments by capturing the sweet companionship bonding between the pets and their owner as well as how do pets behave behind the doors. Music choice and scores by Alexandre Desplats are decent but comparing with Disney; the bright, colorful, state-to-the-art visual effects especially the city skyline is stunningly impressive. This new attempt after the craze on minions continues the mindless entertainment in a repetitive predictability but its flurry fun is overall enjoyable, ends touchingly and definitely amuse the young audiences.<br/><br/>--------------------------------<br/><br/>Part II: Short Film Mower minions, being short but rebound from empty silliness of the spin off movie last year, offering laughs and at the same time delivering the importance of bringing and sharing happiness with the old folks."

","I was looking forward to the release of this movie -previews for such a long time. So waited to go till grandkids were available. and it is not as good as other animated movies released this summer. I did like Max and Buddy - Buddy because I have a dachshund. One of the best things in life is to see a creature that wants to see you so badly when you get home. Back to the movie - the home scenes were fun. The underground bad dogs - not so The references to the crime like people - so over done and how appropriate for young children - that is very debatable. I realize that many children would not understand it and it is the emphasis on the wrongness of bullying - not appropriate. They may not understand it now, but it is in their minds. So some fun things but on an adult level no so good. The animation was OK but being up against the BFG - no contest as to which is better - the BFG. This is not a movie I would have on hand for any future viewing."

","Welcome to the world of Secret Life of Pets, where you and other owners leave their home and your pet starts to do devious things.<br/><br/>When I saw the trailers for this film, I thought that it was going to be a silly, crazy, corny film. But after seeing this film, I was like meh, this wasn't as bad as I thought, but still wasn't wildly entertaining.<br/><br/>The writing was somewhat inconsistent, but the directing makes up for it, creating a funny but weird adventure. The story rehashes the Toy Story plot without much heart. There was not enough emotion and development within the characters, so it felt a bit rushed but it's not like it gets boring and I'm sure it will really entertained the kids more so than the adults or teenagers over 15.<br/><br/>None of the characters really stood out to me, none were ultimately likable but some were still pretty fun to watch, though they were sometimes too over dramatic, even some of them to the point of me not caring much for them. Also, Snowball quickly taking a shine to Molly (the annoying little 7-year-old girl) felt a bit forced.<br/><br/>I wasn't very interested in the character animation and the scenery in this. Yes, the city looks beautiful, but some of the background and character animation is bland. Also, I was confused if Gidget was a kitty or a dog.<br/><br/>The only thing that stood out to me was the music. There was hip-hop and old music in this and that's what I found pretty cool about this film. But there were too many big-named casts in this film.<br/><br/>I would give this movie a 5.9, the adventure about two set of characters was up my alley. But unfortunately, I think Illumination Entertainment is gradually getting worse like Dreamworks. The short that accompanies this film had a pretty good cameo of a dog in Secret Life of Pets but it didn't make much sense. But at this point, I am a little more worried about their upcoming film, Despicable Me 3. Especially since the second one wasn't very good.<br/><br/>Story: 4<br/><br/>Character: 5<br/><br/>Animation: 7"

","Chris Renaud director of Despicable Me, The Lorax and The Minions brings Illumination Entertainment another decent animation. (Who doesn't laugh at the Illumination Entertainment logo when the Minion giggles?) with the help of fellow animator and relative newcomer, Yarrow Cheney. <br/><br/>It has a cast of recognisable voices, mostly from the world of comedy with Louis C.K. taking the lead (see what I did there?) Jenny Slate who previously voiced Bellweather in Disney's Zootopia, Kimmy Schmidt's Ellie Kemper, Kevin Hart and fellow comedians Hannibal Buress, Steve Coogan and even Dana Carvey. Albert Brook's Tiberius Hawk and Coogan's cockney alley cat are my favourites. <br/><br/>As the trailer tells us, C.K.'s Jack Russell Max gets lumbered with Eric Stonestreet's Newfoundland Duke and the two form a relationship reminiscent of John Candy and Steve Martin sharing a hotel room. Trouble ensues and the two of them find themselves on a homeward bound adventure whilst the rest of the gang tried to find them. <br/><br/>There's a couple of hidden plot lines, involving a revolution lead by Hart's Snowball, the not so cute, white, little bunny that would make great casting should Monty Python remake The Holy Grail (that's not a request, purely an observation) but there's also some unnecessary parts obviously used to flesh out the story. At one point our duo somehow walk into a sausage commercial. <br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat does a good score, worthy of family animation film and, again as the trailer suggests, it has an interesting soundtrack with System Of A Down being a highlight. <br/><br/>The animation is vibrant and very well done, bringing New York a nice shiny gloss, even the sewers were colourful; reminded me very much of Disney's Ratatouille. There's some great touches and some clever treats that are funny, just thought it was going to be really funny. <br/><br/>It has a clichÃ©d story with heroics and lessons in friendship but it's a kids movie, a family picture and I would expect children to like this hearing the giggles from the audience but it wasn't the mutt's nuts of a funny film I was expecting. There's nothing really new here. <br/><br/>There's a bonus at the beginning, following in Pixar's lampsteps we get a Minions short about them raising cash by gardening to buy the latest banana blender.

","This movie was indeed a real disappointment. While we figured that most of the truly funny scenes were already shown in the previews, which too many movie advertiser's already do on a regular basis, ruining the enjoyment of actually seeing the movie(s)... But this movie (and it's advertisement department) took that to a whole new level. <br/><br/>Titling this movie and showing the previews they did, made most of us think that the movie was about ""The Secret Life of Pets""!... with the movie showing primarily life thru their eyes, and what they get away with and do, unbeknownst to their human companions. Something every pet ""owner"" suspects and can relate to.<br/><br/>Instead however, other than a small introduction and even smaller ending of this, the entire movie was nothing more than a nonsensical typical story-line of any other cartoon that has been released on TV or in the movies over the past 30+ years. Some of which seemed to be written by some high-school kids. There were a few places where the audience seemed to fall asleep, as the story-line became so slow & boring. <br/><br/>This movie was a major disappointment, and I blame most of it on false advertising and a title that deliberately misled the public into thinking it was something more than a typical run- of-the-mill mediocre cartoon story-line. It is really too bad that they couldn't deliver what they advertised it to be. The concept was great, but the execution & delivery was nonexistent. Save your money, see something else."

"matthewssilverhammer","5","4","9","19 July 2016"," Meh-ow
","The Secret Life of Pets is a modern kid's film. That means it will be super energetic, desperately cute, and often funny. That also means, unless it's preempted by a bouncing desk lamp, it will most likely be nothing more than white noise to pass the time in an air conditioned building full of screaming children and sleepless parents. Illumination Studios (creators of the god-awful Minions) may be the main culprit of this type of derivative drivel, and based on the presentation of their products through cultural ubiquity and Pixar-like universe meta-referencing, they are undeservedly proud of what they've done. Their latest, Pets follows NYC house-pet Max (voiced very well by Louis CK) who, joined by a mismatched group of animals, goes on a series of misadventures to try and make it back to his owner. In many senses, it's better than what Illumination has done so far. Pets' observational humor uses the reality of pet / human behavior to really nice effect. Unfortunately, a large part of the story is spent on less down-to-earth story arcs in order to fill a half-wit plot, bogging down in ill-timed sentimentality, frustratingly blatant 3D and formulaic morals. That mechanical storytelling manipulation is its most glaring problem. Otherwise, there is some really great stuff here. The montages in the individual pet's homes are irrepressibly smile-inducing, the score is a bouncy jazz-based good-time, and there's a hot dog segment set to a Grease song that I totally loved. However, if you've seen Zootopia, Toy Story, Bolt, Up, Finding Nemo or even Dory, then there is nothing new here for you but a Disney-Pixar-knockoff without the sophistication."

","""All of us have suffered at the hand of humans. They say they loves us, then they throw us out."" Snowball (Kevin Hart voice) <br/><br/>Snowball has a jaundiced view of the world, being a cute white rabbit without a home, a street urchin in a most enjoyable animation, The Secret Life of Pets. That he's out to get humans is a given, but his new friends, Jack Russell terrier Max (Louis C.K.) and big mongrel Duke (Eric Stonestreet), come from a more privileged environment but are unleashed to the world when their human leaves for work.<br/><br/>The frequently hilarious and bizarre world of home and homeless pets and the tough animals they conflict and consort with is, of course, a figurative way of looking at how we humans treat those different from us (dogs, cats, for example). Add the dynamic of how we treat our pets, and this romp becomes Animal Farm and Toy Story, with enough slapstick to keep it light but also a happy minimum of preaching the importance of charity and friendship.<br/><br/>Max and Duke duke it out until they find they actually work as a team quite well, an ongoing lesson to see the strengths in others rather than their faults. Even the meanest street animal, living in the sewer, has enough wit and love to earn our respect regardless of how unrefined they are.<br/><br/>When Snowball, as tough and lovable as a rabbit can be, turns on its verbal street machine gun, step aside because he's funny in ways that cross the social divide. Add to these delights a white Pomeranian who watches soaps and a sausage dog rubbing his back with a blender and you can see why I chuckled through most of the animation.<br/><br/>Secret Life is also about the difference between the haves and have not's with plenty of good will to equalize that difference. But most of all, from the Despicable Me and Minions team, Illumination Entertainment, enough cynical observations to fill a Don-Rickles joke book and just enough heart to appeal to optimists. As sea monkeys say, ""It's not our fault if we don't look like the ads."" Yes, you've seen toys in Toy Story on their own when humans are absent, and in a sense this is the same story, including buddies who help each other out (remember Woody and Buzz). <br/><br/>The difference in Secret Life is the witty, sometimes sardonic dialogue: for example, remarks that everyone is moving to Brooklyn, Snowball quips, ""I'm not talking about hipster real estate trends."" The other difference is that so much is going on here the emotional rewards of Toy Story are not as prevalent.<br/><br/>But, hey, it's summer and this is one enjoyable animation."
"GoneWithTheTwins_com","Null","4","9","7 July 2016"," A very human viewpoint - told through the story of lost pets.
","What happens to the pets of New York City when their owners leave their houses for the day? For most, their loyal companions engage in all manner of rambunctious misbehavior and boisterous antics, but for Katie's (Ellie Kemper) terrier Max (Louis C.K.), each day is met with patient waiting for his beloved owner's return. One fateful evening, Katie brings home a new dog, Duke (Eric Stonestreet), which turns Max's world upside down. The large, shaggy brown newcomer quickly butts heads with Max, forcing the smaller pooch to devise a way to remain the alpha. His plan backfires after a disastrous trip to the park, in which Max and Duke firstly find themselves accosted by a band of mangy alley cats, secondly nabbed by animal control, and finally forced into joining an underground brotherhood of abandoned pets - led by maniacal cottontail Snowball (Kevin Hart). As their situation grows grimmer, Max's friend Gidget (Jenny Slate) gathers together a motley gang of animals - including dachshund Buddy (Hannibal Buress), pug Mel (Bobby Moynihan), tabby cat Chloe (Lake Bell), and red-tailed hawk Tiberius (Albert Brooks) - to mount a daring rescue.<br/><br/>Like ""101 Dalmatians,"" ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is told from the perspective of anthropomorphized animals as they embark on an incredible journey. Oddly, though, the film doesn't play by its own rules when it comes to how these creatures perceive humankind. At the start, the main gimmick is that the pets all manage to misbehave or rebel while their masters are away, yet Max is oblivious as to anything going on in his owner's life - such as the unexplainable, unfathomable reason why she would leave every day during most of the daylight hours. Later, he states: ""I don't know any numbers,"" when asked on which floor his apartment is situated. But that doesn't stop nearly all of the other four-legged peers from fully comprehending the English language, reading signs or recognizing city borders, operating vehicles (including taxis and buses), and carving a key out of a carrot.<br/><br/>To counter this very human viewpoint - told through the story of lost pets - are a number of spot-on jokes about dog behaviors. With sequences demonstrating infatuations with balls, being motivated by food, chasing a laser toy, craving attention, and discovering easy distractions, all of the animals adopt classic, recognizable traits. Several laughs are even derived from anxiety urination, sniffing, scooting, territorial habits, and performing tricks. But, of course, the creatures are also fully aware of their own identities and egos, with an understanding for other species, cat vs. dog turf wars, soap opera themes, self control when it comes to carnivorism, mastery of the martial arts, and even romance. This leads to a rather sophisticated, highly unusual, tightlipped, underground assemblage of anti-human, anti-pet-status revolutionaries, like some sort of organized guerrilla warrior society that plans complex schemes for prison breaks and recruitment.<br/><br/>And, though that faction is governed by an unlikely yet shockingly villainous rabbit (one of the few characters modeled after a stuffed toy rather than a real animal, and one of the few roles whose cuddly design can't overcome the conspicuous voicing, here by Kevin Hart), there's still plenty of humor to combat the severity of a toothy viper; a traumatized, tattooed test-pig; an injuriously lonely bird of prey; or hushed reminiscences of past owners who may or may not care that their pet has disappeared. The film is rated PG for rude humor, but there's also something notably dour about the cast of abused sewer-dwellers and their thirst for vengeance. A sausage-heaven daydream, uncanny dexterity, and creative maneuvering through the city are highlights, presented with a level of hilarity that hopes to match the attention to action sequences (and exceptional fur/texturing effects). Though it ought to be primarily a comedy, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is certainly more thrillingly adventurous than laugh-out-loud funny.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Massie Twins</li></ul>"

In short time, anything most rational people would consider appropriate for a child gave way to frightening, gangland-style violence, including discussing the ""glory"" associated with ""pets"" murdering their owners and an attempted ""initiation"" involving an over-sized viper, and an overall tone that is simply disturbing. The greatest disappointment for the moviegoer isn't even in the questionable content of the film itself, but in the fact that it can only be reasonably assumed that the commercials were deliberately misrepresentative of the film as a whole because someone realized that if rational parents were given an accurate depiction, the box office take would have been very disappointing to the company."

"adean81","8","3","7","19 July 2016"," Review for The Secret Life of Pets
","Hot off the heels of Zootopia and Finding Dory comes The Secret Life of Pets. While I went into this movie not really expecting much, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I laughed. The movie is about two dogs, Max and Duke, that get lost in New York City and need to find their way back home before they get sent to the pound. While that doesn't sound like much, there are two other parties of animals that are also trying to find them. One is their friends from their home apartment building and the other is a group of abandon animals from the sewers. <br/><br/>All of the voice talents did a great job with their characters. Louis C.K. is the voice of the dog, Max. Not being a big fan of Louis C.K. I did not really recognize his voice, but he really brought some charm to his character. The female dog and love interest, Gidget, is voiced by Jenny Slate. She does a great job balancing sweet, cute and crazy. The standout voice performance is from Kevin Hart. He voices the bunny, Snowball, who leads the group of abandoned animals called the Flushed Animals. While he may be crazy and slightly evil, he is hilarious and even has a bit of a soft side at the end.<br/><br/>While there is an ongoing plot, that's not really the driving force. The comedy is what keeps the audience watching. The short 87-minute run-time means the movie doesn't drag on in any spots. For the most part, the jokes are nonstop throughout the movie. A lot of the laughs are from visual cues. Mostly making fun of the way that pets think and act. Anyone who owns a pet knows how dogs act around balls and how cat loves the laser pointers. The movie shows all the little habits that pets have and how it can appear to be silly. Perhaps people that don't have pets, might not get the jokes and enjoy the movie as much.<br/><br/>As far as cartoon animal movies go, The Secret Life of Pets is good, fun entertainment for children and adults. If you are looking for something more emotional and dramatic then this is not your movie. However, if you just want to laugh and have a good time, I highly recommend seeing this movie."

At no time was I yearning for a resolution or to ""get on with this"".<br/><br/>I can think of only one or perhaps two scenes that had been spoiled by trailers, another positive aspect of the movie.

Another similarity is that instead of cowboy doll Woody trying to get rid of space toy Buzz Lightyear, it is a Jack Russell Terrier named Max dealing with the new arrival of a big shaggy dog named Duke. Max tries to get rid of Duke, which eventually lands them both in the pound and dealing with abandoned critters in the sewer. This is way too intense for young children. We have a moment where Max and Duke are nearly sacrificed to a one fanged viper, which ends badly for the viper. There is also talk of killing owners, which should lead to interesting conversations with children. We know the drill but at least the characters and animation have appeal. Louis C.K provides the bewildered sarcasm of Max while Eric Stonestreet voices Duke who is given an interesting back story regarding his previous owner. There are a number of colorful supporting characters including a fluffy white Pomeranian named Gidget who leads the search for Max and has romantic feelings for him. Kevin Hart voices a rabbit named Snowball who leads the rebellion against humans. Albert Brooks steals the film voicing a hawk freed by Gidget and against his hungry nature must help her find Max. While it plays on the nature of pets and their lives in private this is still no Toy Story...1, 2 or 3. Score: 7 / 10"

","Somewhat good, somewhat bad! The Secret Life of Pets is an animated film about what pets do when the owners are gone. What's good: The characters The cats, dogs, and the budgie all have personalities. THe Cat is smug, the dogs are silly, but loyal etc. The pet stereo-types the cat chasing the light pointer, Dogs sniffing bums, chasing their tales. The Budgie who is clever but loves to kiss the glass. The ending is great about how pets provide unconditional love. Each pet suits certain personalities. The muscles bound guy with the little budgie. What's bad: The redundant home away from home find home again story, where everyone works together. Sweet Pea the budgie had no voice! The viewer had no idea of what the budgie was thinking. More laughs than slow time. My wife would give it a 8 out of 10, I would give it a 6 out of 10 so it gets a 7 out of 10."
"MichiSo","3","2","4","13 September 2016"," I was let down.
","I was very excited to see this movie after watching the trailer a couple of times because of how funny it appeared. The only funny parts were basically those that appeared in the trailer, conveniently the first 5 minutes of the movie. Characters are stereotypical and not very likable, and the plot is very shallow. <br/><br/>The only positive thing that I can say about it is that the animation is very well-made, and visually it works. <br/><br/>There are many reviews of people that have taken their kids to watch this that say that this is not a very kid-friendly movie, I would also add that it is not a very adult-friendly movie either. In summary, enjoy the trailer."
"pronker","9","2","4","31 August 2016"," Fun for all and free for all action!
","For anyone with a sympathy for animals, pets or otherwise, this movie fills the bill with fantastic animation of fur, wings, and scales. I was thrilled and delighted with it from start to finish, and the setting of NYC makes for backdrops both colorful and dangerous. For example, the colors of the trees and magical quality of the river's waters highlight the doings of the pets. Speaking of pets, it was fun to see all sorts and not just cats and dogs. Tarantulas, snakes, pigs and birds all came in for their share of attention. The voice acting was superb. Louis C.K. came across as an Everydog, waiting patiently yet anxiously for the return of his human friend each day. The upstart dog shakes up his world. My son and I traveled some distance to see this film and were not sorry. A TV show from Dreamworks, Penguins of Madagascar, is set in NYC so the action bits of leaping onto bus bumpers for transportation and showing one animal driving using the steering wheel while another pushes the pedals made me LOL in recognition."

","It was a cute movie. There were times that I found the movie a little over the top.<br/><br/>It was a nice escapist movie, that had some cute animals. I really liked the character of daddy.<br/><br/>I like how the friends banded together to help one of their own. my favorite part was when they fell in love. The evil mouse was hysterical. The fact that Katie was so calm after finding the mess in her apartment was unbelievable.

","Just a gist of the story* which I honestly think you've all seen in the trailer already, if not probably on E!<br/><br/>The film centers on a dog, Max, whose owner decides to take home another dog, Duke, which startles him. They basically go on a journey of finding their way back home, after getting lost due to their conflict. Max's love interest, Gidget, then teams up with Max's other friends to try and find him.<br/><br/>Along the way, Max and Duke meets an anti-human group lead by a cute- but really deceiving rabbit (played by the comedian Kevin Hart). -- so on and so fort.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>REVIEW PART: basically what you need to know if you want to watch this film.<br/><br/>POSITIVE: 1. This film is hilarious! I mean, I'm 20 and I found this story really cute, interesting and entertaining (in general) 2. The jokes are more a combination of smart-dialogue based jokes, semi- dirty jokes and visual jokes (like your typical show and not tell type of jokes where the character stumbles in a funny way). 3. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS in totality is so good - the film's visually amusing. 4. The world it creates it really great. 5. It's concept is something someone out there would've probably thought of already, nonetheless, fresh. 6. All of the characters give you reason to love them. 7. The RABBIT + MAX'S LOVE INTEREST = 2 BEST THINGS ABOUT THE FILM.<br/><br/>NEGATIVE: 1. Some jokes are, too me, a bit green for the film to be G-rated. It seems like the writer forgot for a moment who his audience is. 2. IT COULD'VE GONE DEEPER. I'm not asking for a Big Hero 6 or UP kind of emotional scene or writing, but at least give us something to remember besides the cuteness of the characters. They could've given us something we'd take home and tell our friends about or a quote we could tweet. I don't know what exactly they could've done, but the film could've honestly been better if the filmmakers gave it a more emotional side to it. 3. Half-baked. The main arc (or plot) is there but the smaller plots seem confused onto what they really want us to comprehend. They have an end goal, and that's the only thing that matters (that the two pets get their way back home).<br/><br/>IN TOTALITY, if you're looking a film to watch just to have fun and fill your life with cuteness then go watch this film! But if you're expecting something that will make you cry, then this film is not for you. It really won't make you teary."

","Max is a terrier happily living in a Manhattan apartment with his owner Katie. His world is turned upside down when Katie bring home a shaggy dog named Duke. Max tries to be the alpha and Duke pulls him out of the dog park. The duo is cornered by alley cats, captured by dog catchers, and released by a gang of ""Flushed Pets"" from the sewers led by a people-hating rabbit named Snowball. Gidget is a dog who likes Max. She recruits another group to look for the missing dogs. Max and Duke escape from Snowball who vows to hunt them down.<br/><br/>This is a wacky chaotic stew of loud animated animals. It is unrelenting in its fun-obsessed story. The voice work is good comedy. There are probably too many characters. It's not that much of a secret life when the pets are driving a bus causing traffic chaos. This is geared more towards the younger kids. The non-stop brightly-colored action-powered movie will keep them from getting too bored if it doesn't exhaust them."

","The movie gives us a chance to get close to pets, so that pets can sell their cuteness on the screen unscrupulously, and audiences familiar with pets can treat all kinds of pets, especially dogs, as treasures. Perhaps this is the original intention of lighting entertainment. After all, pets are the most loyal friends of mankind, we are their world, and we should give them unlimited pets and love."
"briancham1994","Null","0","0","31 May 2020"," A whole lot of nothing
","This film keeps on setting things up and just leaving them. The rivalry between Max and Duke could have gone somewhere, but it just resolved itself. Duke trying to find his previous owner could have gone somewhere, but it was glossed over in a minute. The only thing that really went somewhere was the sewer animals and that was more comedic. The animation itself and the side characters made up for this meandering storyline, with the exception of Kevin Hart - sorry, he's just too loud and obnoxious."
"filipemanuelneto","10","0","0","10 May 2020"," Very good.
","I was attracted to this film for a simple reason: my girlfriend is very fond of animated films. From the same creators of ""Despicable Me"", its quite interesting and begins with a good premise: what do our pets do when we leave home every day...<br/><br/>The whole story revolves around Max and Duke, two dogs who end up lost in New York. While the remaining animals in the building join forces to find them, led by a cute little dog, Gidget, they end up in trouble when they find - and irritate - the mob led by Snowball, a lovely white rabbit who has a deep hatred for humans. This film was made for younger audiences but not entirely for children, I believe, so I think that children over seven or eight years old will understand the film very well, which is not exactly shocking.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting things here is the long list of adorable and cute characters. The dogs (Max, Duke, Gidget, Pops, Buddy and Mel) are noteworthy but are closely followed by the rabbit, Snowball, which was so successful and became so popular that it was one of the movie's merchandising hits. The obese cat Chloe, the guinea-pig Reginald, the budgerigar Sweet Pea and the hawk Tiberius also deserve a special look. The dialogues and jokes were well done and there are subtle nods here and there to another studio works (particularly the ""Despicable Me"" franchise) as well as other popular films and series like ""Saturday Night Fever"". However, jokes and humor are not to laugh out loud and sometimes barely works. The film has excellent voice actors, most of them with some other voice works in their pocket. Among them, I highlight the performance of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Jenny Slate, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell, Steve Coogan and Kevin Hart.<br/><br/>Technically, it was difficult to demand better. It has one of the best opening sequences I've seen in animated films, with the animals taking care of their owners' houses as soon as they walk out the front door. CGI and the quality of the animations are impeccable, with the animals drawn in their details, magnificent colors and light, movement and action at the right times and inexhaustible doses of cuteness. I read some comments on the Internet in which some people said they had experienced difficulties with the pace, with the second part proving to be more tiring and dragging. Personally, I didn't feel that much, I think it developed well and the final part was really fun. Perhaps yes, one or another scene takes longer than necessary, perhaps a more skillful editing effort has been lacking, but that seem to me a minor problem. Finally, I still have to leave a note of praise for the excellent soundtrack, by Alexandre Desplat, with some jazz tones that are simply pleasant... and pertinent! After all, it's New York!"

","Kids movies continue to swarm into the theaters, and Hollywood's trailer editors have been hard at work baiting us in. With Disney owning the box office this summer, Illumination Entertainment (the creators of Despicable Me) are taking a shot at the box office run. This weekend we got The Secret Life Of Pets, a movie that has been highly anticipated since it's trailer debut from so long ago. It was indeed a very entertaining trailer, but we all know how trailers can be deceptive now don't we? So I have headed into the trenches again to report on the latest film to hit the silver screen.<br/><br/>The GOOD Cute/Kid Friendly Funny Good animation<br/><br/>When you watch, or for many rewatch, the trailers you most likely saw the characters as cute, cuddly animals doing hilarious things. Good news! The trailer is accurate this time and provides the cute factor you expected (including the very scenes you saw in the trailer). All of the characters are adorable, the main ones being bouncy, fluffy, high-spirited animals that will make you want to say Awwwwww. Our design team found a way to maximize all the cute features of an animal and sell it to the families that will lead to merchandising. Even animals you wouldn't think cute (like snakes, gators, and lizards) get the cuddly personifications. Hopefully you have gathered from this, that the design is kid friendly and will have your little ones enamored.<br/><br/>But cute is only the hook, what keeps the interest going in this film? The answer is the comedy of course. The stunts the animals pull are entertaining and the dialogue itself had me chuckling at many of the media references. Voice acting only helps sell the comedy more, especially Kevin Hart and all his high pitched screaming. Your kids though will be the ones to enjoy the comedy the most though, as it is slapstick, simplistic antics with digital pets. Running into walls, making funny faces, or going to the bathroom on the floor are just some of the things you will see that had toddlers chuckling in their seats.<br/><br/>And a small bonus, that really shouldn't be a surprise, is that the animation is good. Illumination Entertainment certainly has their anatomy and physiology down being able to superimpose human qualities while still maintaining there animal qualities. Glad to know that our animation studios are still able to produce great works. If only they could have put that effort into the next few qualities.<br/><br/>THE BAD The Story Lack of Uniqueness Trailers showed you a lot of the movie<br/><br/>With the comedy and animation being the obvious focus, you have to wonder how the story fared in this movie. Unfortunatelyit didn't fare that well. Oh it's not that bad at all, but the problem is that it lacks anything memorable or emotionally driving for me. The writers crammed a lot of plots into a short 90 minutes run time, and the resulting production was a very rushed, shallow tale with little development. A split focus resulted in little emotional build-up, and there was no intriguing qualities to keep my attention on any of the cast. And the goal they were trying to achieve was very limited and didn't really set any time limit or urgency to the tale.<br/><br/>To add more fuel to that fire, The Secret Life of Pets wasn't really that unique of a movie. We've had talking pet movies before, where anthropomorphic animals traverse a city or town that often involves a very extreme villain (think Oliver and Company or Homeward Bound). Those tales stick home because they had edge, depth, and moments that stick out in your mind. Not the case with this movie, as again there was no drive to make our pets grow, develop, or even go through much struggle at all. It doesn't have any twists to mix things up either, and therefore leaves little to spoilt. In addition, much of the movie, including a lot of the funny parts, is revealed in the three trailers out and therefore you can save yourself some major bucks by just rewatching all of the trailers. Yeah, I know that is de"

","The Secret Life of Pets"" is a very successful film from Universal, the same folks who brought us the ""Despicable Me"" franchise. While I am thrilled that the studio decided to do something other than yet another sequel, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a highly uneven movie.<br/><br/>The story starts off terrifically well. The opening sequence is simply breaktaking--with some of the best CGI you'll ever see. I was very impressed with this...as well as watching all the various pets acting like pets. However, the film simply did not maintain this momentum. Once the two dogs, Max and Duke, got lost...so did the story. The notion of human-hating animals living in the sewers and stealing dog pound trucks is pretty stupid....and unappealing. Instead of being cute like the film had been, it tries to get edgy and it misfires. In other words, and this will sound weird, the film was much better when it had little in the way of plot (one of the reasons I loved ""Minions"" is because it was less wedding to plot and more to fun). Overall, an uneven film that becomes somewhat tiresome after a while."

Desplat's excellent jazzy score elevates a lot of other scenes.

The animation is probably one of the best Illumination efforts in a while, and while the story and characters aren't very memorable, it just struck the right chords to be enjoyable. It wasn't trying to win any awards, heck, U don't even think it was trying to be good. But it was decent. Not the kind of thing I would buy on Blu-Ray, but something I was happy with. It's cliche, but enjoyable.

","(Not sure there's any real spoilers in here, but safe than sorry.) I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Secret Life of Pets""! It tells a great story that a lot of us can relate to, especially us older siblings! Max the Jack Russell Terrier has a pretty great life with his owner Katie in an apartment in Manhattan. That all gets upended when Katie brings home Max's new ""brother"", an... um... ""exuberant"" mutt named Duke.<br/><br/>They do not, needless to say, become best buds from the get-go.<br/><br/>What follows from there is a humorous, exciting tail (whoops) I mean ""tale"" where we are introduced to a myriad of interesting characters - my favorite being Gidget, a feisty and good-humored Pomeranian (voiced by Jenny Slate). Max, btw, is voiced by Louis C.K. and Duke by Eric Stonestreet, both doing terrific work.<br/><br/>But it's Kevin Hart, voicing the movie's main antagonist Snowball, a VERY bitter white rabbit, who steals the show - for a very real, very tragic reason. Abandoned by his human, Snowball has organized ""The Flushed Pets"" - other animals callously tossed aside by people that just got tired of them.<br/><br/>Sure, there's lots of laughs in ""Pets"" (some of which will go right over the heads of kids), but there are also some pretty good teaching moments, especially about being a responsible pet owner."

","In a fantastic world where pets can talk to each other, a small dog by the name of Max is forced to face a harsh fact. His owner brings him a new roommate with whom he must share everything. Unfortunately, their relationship seems doomed from the beginning due to differences in character and also in size, but this is about to change when they must work together to return home after the city pound catches them without collars.<br/><br/>It is a funny animation which tells the story of two very different dogs who struggle to tolerate each other and as you would expect, they're forced to put their differences aside in order to survive and get home to their owner. It seems funny at the beginning and it manages to make you laugh from time to time, but far from the expectations I had, while the plot is simplistic, very predictable and very common. As you can tell from its rating, it's an average movie which doesn't stand out from the crowd with anything, thus making it only a good watch, bound to be forgotten very soon, although it had potential through its imagined world."

","Walt Disney once said that the best animated films were not made just for children alone. An amazingly clever and intricately animated film for children of all ages. Yes, most of the animals can talk, but only when their owners aren't around just like ""Toy Story"". It would be a ""10"" except for: a vicious Viper Snake and talk about ""doing away"" with humans by the evil bunny and others. The first 30 minutes outshine the rest of the movie. Max the dog gets a new roommate in the form of a big lovable, sloppy, hairy ""homeless"" dog named Duke and they get lost together at the dog park. It's everything a good dog movie should be plus several things it shouldn't be. Several clichÃ©s intertwine with several unpredictable plot twists: Two animal gangs: despicable alley cats and rejected ""flushed"" pets (reptiles, spiders,snakes). The two dogs are mistaken as strays by two mean dogcatchers. ""Duke"" goes on a quest to look for his old master (who has died of old age). A ""Mad Hatter"" of an otherwise cute-looking bunny rabbit goes after them with a vengeance, then saves them both from certain drowning in the dogcatcher's truck. So many things going on including animals partying while the owner's ""do whatever it is they do"" during the workaday hours. Incredible action throughout the dangerous city including dark and smelly sewers and unfinished NYC skyscrapers. The ingenious use of many familiar songs, including ""We Go Together"" from ""Grease"", after Max and Duke have a food coma after pigging out on dozens and dozens of sausages at the hot dog factory. Overall, a fantastic family movie from Illumination Films who also made ""The Minion Movie"". Not perfect but excellent anyway. It's just ""purr-fect""! I can see why it was such a box office hit in 2016! Look for an ""Easter Egg"" a few minutes into the ending credits. It is too intense for very small children under age 6 or so although several reviewers think it was made for that age group."

","The interviews that come with the DVD are telling in the creators talk about working through a 'idea' about what pets might do when the owners go out for the day. It's a interesting idea perhaps but not really enough to carry a feature length movie. Maybe they all act like humans? It's not exactly spell-binding. OK its fun and in YouTube sized morsels it plays very well and should be a hit for younger kids. Quality animations should be good enough to carry grown-ups. Good animated films in my book all have a hook or two that ground the story in real i.e. human world reality, society or psychology and play on that - for instance the fun & intelligent Inside Out, or deliver charisma & charm like the character Rango. Zootropolis has a few great characters. The narrative in Secret Lives of Pets is lame and inconsequential, and the seminal 'idea' lost the intrigue for me early on. This is well-rendered and colorful, credit to the production craft team, but also sadly carried a major deficit in humour and empathy. Best left on repeat in a nursery room."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","5","0","0","23 March 2017"," Goofy with fun characters, but a stale story
","Animated films changed forever when Pixar's ""Toy Story"" showed us what are toys are up to when we're not around. More than 20 years later, that tradition of storytelling continues in Illumination Entertainment's ""The Secret Life of Pets,"" which applies the same concept to house pets (and who doesn't love talking animals). This ""unseen world,"" however, has half the wit and imagination.<br/><br/>Animation storytellers have done an incredible job building intricate worlds in the same way sci-fi geniuses do, and the potential is certainly there for ""Secret Life of Pets."" This has yet to be Illumination's calling card, however. The ""Despicable Me"" films succeeded on clever slapstick and delightful characters. ""Pets"" has plenty of that to offer, but it runs out of steam after a point.<br/><br/>""Pets"" follows Manhattan pup Max (Louis C.K.) whose life with owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) is turned upside-down when Katie brings home a big, clumsy rescue dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). The resentful Max tries to get Duke in trouble, and their cruel back-and-forth schemes result in both getting lost in the concrete jungle and in danger from a group of stray, abandoned animals.<br/><br/>Other than pointing out the similarities to the Woody-Buzz conflict in ""Toy Story,"" I won't make any more comparisons, but the point is that the originality is sorely lacking. Some jokes contrasting real- life animal behaviors to personified animal behaviors stand out, like Chloe the lazy cat (Lake Bell) going ballistic when she sees a laser pointer – being wielded by fellow animals. Then there are the dogs in the park who make fun of an owner using a fetching stick. Writers Cinco Paul and Ken Dario of the ""Despicable Me"" films, and Brian Lynch, play with that range of humor really well, but aren't able to channel that creative energy into the plot.<br/><br/>The Max-Duke saga has a forgone conclusion from the very start, and the points along the way are not all that surprising aside from an incredibly strange diversion to a sausage factory. ""Pets"" redeems itself with its assortment of characters, some archetypal and some that defy expectation. <br/><br/>Jenny Slate's Gidget is one of the bigger hits; she plays a poodle with a crush on Max who rallies the neighborhood pets to find and save him, a subplot that's decidedly more interesting than the danger Max and Duke are in. Her relationship with a hawk voiced by Albert Brooks is refreshingly unusual, and Dana Carvey's Pops is one of few characters that keep us on our toes. Kevin Hart's cute-but- nasty bunny, Snowball, appears to be subversive of typical animated characters, but ultimately ends up being a token character in disguise. All in all, the interest level in ""Pets"" buoys based on which characters are on screen.<br/><br/>Illumination has a lot of work to do if it wants to enter the Pixar/Disney/DreamWorks echelon in more than just the box office sense. Its movies are fun and amusing, but everything that happens in ""Pets"" feels familiar and done three times before (like animals driving cars, which we saw not even a month earlier in ""Finding Dory""). I have no issues with their films that knowingly stick to goofiness – nor with the ways this one does; they do it so well. But the premise of ""The Secret Life of Pets"" suggested something grander in style and scope that simply isn't there, and the story ultimately disappoints.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

This made the movie pretty enjoyable for most parts.<br/><br/>One main criticism is probably how much violence is depicted in this animated film, car crashes occur often and look pretty serious. Mature themes such as death and revenge are explored liberally as well.

","You may have heard this with cats and mice instead of humans and pets. But the allegory is what this movie is about. Actually if you saw the trailer you know the overall premise even without reading anything more about it. If you ever had a pet you probably were wondering if there is more to their life and what they were doing while you didn't look. This movie wants to show you what you were missing.<br/><br/>Well obviously this isn't real and I'm not only talking about the fact it is animated. It also tries to give us more than just the on punchline and all the jokes we've already seen in the trailer. Which is nice, but overall you can say this is a very uneven affair. Still it strong enough to keep kids entertained and adults should have their fair share of fun too. Never mind the convoluted story and any other mess you'll most likely see - just enjoy the hyper active bunny and the rest of the crew."

","Before I write my own reviews, I usually take a look at some of the others already posted along with a handful of message board posts. With each passing day and movie, I find myself being slowly relegated to a long ago time and place when people could actually enjoy a cartoon or animated feature without some highly sensitive person coming unglued over perceived notions of abuse or racism. As I write this, there are three message board posts on the title page for this film calling it horrible for children and one that calls it out for a message of white privilege. I'm no longer astonished that comedians like Jerry Seinfeld no longer do college comedy tours; audiences seem to be offended by everything these days.<br/><br/>Let me tell you something, in my day, Wile E. Coyote ALWAYS fell off the cliff, Bug Bunny ALWAYS beat Yosemite Sam, and Tweety ALWAYS foiled Sylvester. And I think I came out pretty much O.K. Right there though, that comment will garner a number of negs for this review, but for me it's worth it just to get it off my chest.<br/><br/>So for me, the movie was an entertaining interlude, seeing it with my eight year old granddaughter who had a good time watching it as well. In fact, I'm late to the party because she'd already seen it four times in theaters, while I'm catching it at a library showing for neighborhood kids. They let us old timers in with the proper credentials, not knowing if we've been scarred for life by Daffy Duck taking it out on Porky Pig.<br/><br/>The writers for this film came up with some clever observations regarding household pets with a story that had a couple of lost dogs triumph over their big city environment to make it all the way back home safe and sound. It required teamwork and perseverance and that's a pretty good message for youngsters to figure out. By the time it was over, even the ferocious rabbit leader Snowball mellowed out, showing that he could roll with the punches with the best of them.<br/><br/>So there, I've had my say. For all the naysayers out there, it's time to get a grip. You can have some family fun and a good time with this movie, because not every animated flick has to be treated as if it was poo-poo with a dash of ca-ca."

","The Secret Life of Pets is truly an enjoyable animation film that mixes those elements that work in any animated film to make it family friendly: good visuals, nice main characters, cuteness, adventure, clean humour, no hot topics, and overall fun. Besides, as this is not a movie about anthropomorphic animals, but about real pets and street animals, so it has the added flare of reproducing the behavior that some animals show in real life with humans, something that will delight pet owners.<br/><br/>The voicing of the characters is perhaps the thing that I enjoyed the most, really great in all cases, Kevin Hart (Snowball) being my favorite character and voice in the film.<br/><br/>The film doesn't have any hidden message, any moral teaching, or anything that will make it unforgettable regarding the visuals, the story, the idea behind the film, or the visual narrative.

"bryank-04844","4","0","0","23 January 2017"," Nothing is so secret about 'The Secret Life of Pets'!
","It seems like there are a wealth of animated talking animal movies these days. With Pixar, Disney, and DreamWorks releasing 'Zootopia', 'The Good Dinosaur', 'Finding Dory' and 'Kung Fu Panda 3' recently, it only seems fair that Universal dipped their hands into the sub-genre as well with 'The Secret Life of Pets'. Universal's animation studio Illumination Entertainment brought us 'Despicable Me' and those darn 'Minions' to the big screen, which has made the entertainment business billions of dollars. It seems logical for the studio to cash in on the talking animal genre now, since everyone else is doing it, however with an already over-crowded market for these films, 'The Secret Life of Pets' may fall short of beating out 'Zootopia' and 'Finding Dory' in both the financial and critical realms. I'm not saying that 'The Secret Life of Pets' is a bad movie or anything. In fact there are some great moments that are funny and charming, but it loses itself in the second half of the film when it becomes an action-caper movie that becomes over-the-top and even drags in its short run time of less than 90 minutes.<br/><br/>The film really succeeds when it shows just what are pets do when we humans leave for work in the morning and go out the door. The writers and director ('Despicable Me') sure had some clever and hilarious gags that showed the special nuances of our pets that all of us can relate to, but the story revolves around Max (Louis C.K.), a terrier who has a great bond with his owner. All of that changes when his new owner brings home a new giant brown dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). These two dogs are basically the equivalent of Mike and Sully from 'Monster's Inc.' in both shape and personality. The two don't get along due to some jealousy issues, but the pair of dogs find themselves lost in the streets in a beautifully rendered Manhattan without collars, and are now on the run from the dog catchers as well as an underground animal rebellion known as the 'Flushed Pets', led by a psychotic ninja bunny rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart turned up to 11).<br/><br/>Max's pet friends try to search for him, including a ritzy and hopeless romantic Pomeranian (Jenny Slate), an obese house cat (Lake Bell), a hyperactive pug (Bobby Moynihan), a relaxed dachshund (Hannibal Buress), a tiny parakeet (Tara Strong), a confused Hawk (Albert Brooks), and a spry, old hound (Dana Carvey). Yes, there are too many characters here, and in fact, there are more in the film, which is one of its downfalls. There are just too many characters to juggle in this short time span and most characters just show up for a small amount of time for a few jokes and laughs, then basically disappear.<br/><br/>Again, the first half of the film is quite enjoyable with all of the quirks and actions of each pet getting laughs, however in the second half of the film, pets are driving human cars down the busy streets of New York and all come together in a 'Spider- Man' like scenario climax. Perhaps one of the best scenes in the film is when Max and Duke head to a hot dog factory that plays out like 'Grease' and early 40's musical movies. With most of the characters not getting enough time for care and the over- the-top action sequences once again, 'The Secret Life of Pets' becomes rather exhausting and most unfunny toward the end. Still, the film looks amazing visually with the ever so tall skyline of New York as seen through the eyes of our smaller furry friends and the score by Alexandre Desplat sounds excellent and has the Woody Allen New York vibe to it. The film is still mostly enjoyable and has some great comedic moments, but if it just stuck with a simpler story line, instead of turning into an action film, things would have flowed smoother.<br/><br/>WORTH A LOOK!"

So for me it was disappointing because animation movies are just not really my thing. I'm too old for that. I read on here that it's not really suitable for kids and I wonder why people would think that. I thought it was perfect for kids. Unless you think kids nowadays are still little pussies like you were at their age then I get your point.

","Secret Life of Pets follows, as you can probably guess, the secret life pets have when their owners aren't around. Max is a terrier who's enjoyed all the love and affection he gets from his owner, but everyday when she goes to work, he's left alone, waiting for her return. His fellow pet friends, whose owners have also left for work all come and hang out, including Chloe the cat, Mel the pug, Sweet Pea the budgie, and Gidget the Pomeranian; who lives in the building next door so can only watch from afar. One day Max's owner comes home with a new pet; Duke the Newfoundland, who poses a difficulty to Max's comfort and way of life. What ensues is Max and Duke getting lost in New York City after constantly trying to get rid of each other, and Gidget and the rest of the gang trying to track them down. Along the way they meet Snowball and his sewer-dwelling gang of anti-owners, and Tiberius the predatory eagle, and Pop the disabled basset hound.<br/><br/>Being a family movie, the story of Secret Life of Pets is unsurprisingly formulaic and predictable. Max and Duke constantly try to one-up each other, get lost and into trouble, but learn valuable lessons along the way, accept each other, and are found and return home safe and sound. There's no subtext, there's no twist, there's no complexity. It's a linear story with no surprises and not too much originality. But it's a family movie, they're not exactly known for their top-notch storytelling (not even Disney/Pixar are capable of breaking this).<br/><br/>Secret Life of Pets isn't even particularly new in it's humour. The opening montage that introduces us to all the main characters is probably the movie's high point. Unfortunately this montage was pretty much the whole trailer, so watching the actual movie doesn't improve on that. We see Chloe gorging her face on food, Mel barking at squirrels outside his window, Sweet Pea pretending to fly through canyons on the TV, Buddy scratching himself with a mixer, and of course the poodle that changes the music to System of a Down. The humour from this point on is a little lacking. It's mostly slapstick to appeal to younger minds, and I'm sure it's successful in that regard, but I doubt anyone older than the age of ten will find the image of an aggressive gang leader rabbit pooping himself randomly hilarious.<br/><br/>On the note of Snowball and his gang, I have read some controversy on message boards about how violent this film is, and I can't say I overly disagree. Snowball's gang are quite violent and provide the most threat to Max and his crew, but they're also overtly shown as the antagonists. In my opinion, kids could do with a little more darkness in their movies, so this was welcome, but it still wasn't exactly as scary or dark as movies were when I was younger.<br/><br/>It's a breathtakingly beautiful movie. Between this and Minions, Illumination have demonstrated that they are second to none in creating breathtakingly detailed and photo-realistic vistas. Secret Life of Pets is bursting with vibrant colour and detail in every scene, from gorgeous cityscapes and autumnal colours, to textures of stone, brick and wood that are treated with excruciating detail. I can't state enough how incredibly impressed I was with the imagery in Secret Life of Pets. An opening scene of Max and his owner going for a walk in the park with vibrant autumnal leaves everywhere, and a towering, imposing city full of lights and colours behind was so crisp and clear.<br/><br/>While Secret Life of Pets is absolutely aimed at those with younger minds, the movie is rife with references to other properties that only more experienced viewers will discover. I often found it was a little too heavy-handed in it's references, and maybe a little too self-serving. For instance, the amount of references to Minions and Despicable Me were uncountable. Minions made appearances in almost every scene, Gru can be seen in the background, as well as the unicorn, and the gnome from the Minions short. The love of Universal properties is also rife, including The Tonight Show, and Universal and Illumination's upcoming Sing. But there's others that are a little more thoughtful and subtle, like the sliding turtle taking out enemies in a reference to Super Mario, or a lizard bursting out from a disguise mirroring the chest- burster from Alien, Snowball's revolution against humanity as a homage to Animal Farm, a poster from Hitchcock's The Birds, and an emotional reference to ""Ricky"" a la Boyz N The Hood.<br/><br/>I know my review of Secret Life of Pets seems awfully scathing, but I did enjoy it in a lowest common denominator way. It's fun, it's entertaining, it's sometimes quite funny, and it's absolutely a visual feast for the eyes. I didn't feel I wasted an hour and a half of my life once the credits rolled, but it is an unremarkable movie. It doesn't try anything new or fresh, it makes no effort to seek longevity or classic status. It's a fleeting time that is mediocre and largely forgettable, made for the sole entertainment of children and nothing else. On that note, I can't call it a failure. But it's not a great movie. It's not a bad movie either, not by any means, but I don't feel not seeing it would result in missing out. I give Secret Life of Pets and enjoyably fleeting experience worthy of a 6/10. I'm sure my four-year old will love it though."
"leonblackwood","7","0","0","8 January 2017"," Extremely funny throughout! 7/10
","Review: It's not very often that these animation creators get the mixture of adult and children's humour right, which is why I really enjoyed this movie. The various characters were well put together and the plot had more than enough twists, to make it interesting throughout. The Bunny, voiced by Kevin Hart, cracked me up, and I was quite impressed with the attention to detail. The story is based on a little Jack Russell named Max, who is loved by his owner, Katie but when she brings home a mongrel called Duke, Max feels that he is invading his space. After Duke tries to become friends with Max, he decides to use a fearful approach so he isn't taken back to the pound. Duke then tries to abandon Max in an alley but they are both attacked by some vicious alley cats, who steal there collars and leave them to be caught by pest control. On the way to the pound, a little bunny, Snowball, breaks his friend free from the van, and he frees Duke & Max and takes them to his secret hideout. They soon realise that Snowball is the leader of a gang, called the Flushed Pets, and after proving that they are worthy to join the gang, they have to go through a initiation, by getting bitten by a viper. As Max & Duke are not willing to get bitten, they flee the secret hideout, mistakenly killing the viper, so Snowball vows to kill them, with the help of the Flushed Pets. Meanwhile, Gidget, a dog who lives in the same apartment block as Max and has a crush on him, becomes aware that Max is missing, so she gathers the other animals in the block, to try and find Max. Whilst on the run, Max & Duke try to find Dukes owner, but Duke is captured by the pest control again, along with some of Snowballs crew, so they join forces to rescue them. Its quite a crazy story, which does go from one instinct to another but it's an joyful ride, which has an emotional ending. It does take some time to get going, but once Duke and Snowball come on the scene, it really is non-stop to the end. I'm looking forward to the sequel, which is due out in 2018. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Coming from the stable who brought you the Minions and Despicable Me, I'm not surprised that this movie nearly made a Billion dollars at the box office, and the mini movies on the disk were also a joy to watch. The movie was directed by Chris Renaud, who brought you No Times For Nuts in 2006, the great Despicable Me in 2010, The Lorax in 2012 and Despicable Me 2 in 2013. I'm surprised he didn't direct the Minions movie, which went to Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin but it was still a good film without the creator of the franchise. The plot in this movie, is pretty complex compared to a lot of other straight forward animated movies, and the vibrant colours and various animals, really made me appreciate the amount of work that went into this project. I just hope the sequel lives up to my expectations!<br/><br/>Budget: $75million Worldwide Gross: $875.4million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies, voiced by Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell, Dana Carvey and Steve Coogan. 7/10"
"rooee","4","7","25","3 July 2016"," Uninspired Illumination animation
","Surely a case of concept first/plot comes later, The Secret Life of Pets is the latest feature from Illumination, the animation studio responsible for (to blame for?) everything Minions-related. Though there are references, Pets wisely doesn't try to replicate the little yellow army. But while the new movie does its own thing, I'm not sure it will have the simple, resilient appeal of the Despicable series.<br/><br/>Jack Russell terrier Max (Louis C. K.) lives in a Manhattan apartment block, populated by all kinds of apparently perfect pets who lead rebellious shadow lives while their owners are away. Max adores his master. So when she brings home a stray dog, Duke (Eric Stonestreet), a fierce rivalry begins.<br/><br/>One day they are out for a walk when Duke decides to get Max into trouble by dragging him off the beaten track. Duke and Max come up against a gang of cats, led by the vicious Ozone (Steve Coogan). After being captured by Animal Control, the dogs are inadvertently rescued by a rabbit called Snowball (Kevin Hart), who introduces them to The Flushed Pets, a society of forgotten animals who live in the sewer. The encounter triggers a series of farcical events against the backdrop of Max's and Duke's journey home – and of course their burgeoning friendship.<br/><br/>My synopsis doesn't scratch the surface of what is a weirdly complicated storyline. I've named but a fraction of the enormous cast. The film suffers from a damaging overabundance of characters resulting in a ridiculously busy plot. Combined with its vehement slapstick focus and almost complete lack of pathos, it's a dizzying ADHD experience which is aimed at the very young and the very excitable.<br/><br/>Beyond the titular premise there is little invention or originality. Lovely animation infuses the animals with personality. But they aren't helped by a rote script which puts a frankly boring, not-particularly-odd couple front and centre while sidelining the potentially interesting creatures (Albert Brooks' pathologically predatory hawk is briefly hilarious).<br/><br/>Some jokes strike, even if the pacing makes them fleeting. My personal favourite moment was in the sewers and a visual reference to Super Mario Bros' dashing green Koopa shells. But too many big punchlines land softly, spread across too many plot threads. If it feels like we're watching a series of vignettes then that's surely telling us that this is a short film stretched to scattering point.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's because it comes so soon after another anthropomorphised animal animation, Zootropolis, with its vibrancy and its depth, that Pets comes across as so visually dull and narratively rudimentary. In a post-Pixar world, ""just a kids' film"" doesn't cut it. A mediocre film is a mediocre film, even one with moments of individual brilliance – all of which, I can report, can be seen in the trailers."

","Seriously, if Universal cannot handle animals and humans, how do you think it's going to handle animal-human hybrids, let alone human-animal hybrids that sing?... Sorry, I got sidetracked. *ahem*.<br/><br/>Much like Daddy's Home and The Road Chip, I was held against my will to watch this train-wreck. Right when I entered the theater, I had set the bar so low to the ground only an ant would be able to limbo underneath it. So clearly someone in the movie had a pet ant, because it limbo'd underneath it in spectacularly lazy fashion.<br/><br/>The story is predictable and boring. Many times over I groaned at some line of dialogue and put my face in the palm of my hand. I can only point out maybe two scenes that got a chuckle out of me, and even then they were lame compared to other things that came out of this year. The little white dog Gidget has a crush on our main character? Well, she's gonna get him by the end of it! Never mind that he has no idea she even exists... okay, that's a bit of a stretch. They talk to each other, but Max (the main character) never looks at her and just kinda stares into the distance. So when Max goes missing and Gidget decides to recruit pets to save him, while making a speech proclaiming her true love. It was at this point I whispered to person next to me ""he has no idea you exist"", which in turn got a laugh out of them.<br/><br/>Let's talk more about the characters. They're bad. I think the only decent one is Snowball (Kevin Hart? What's he doing in a PG movie? I thought he was busy with Central Intelligence!), and even then that's really not enough to warrant good characters. Quite frankly, Max is unlikable. Duke tries to have a tragic backstory but it's completely forgotten about within the the next minute. Chloe is alright I guess, but still only barely. I already talked about Gidget, who is probably the worst character. Every other character they have serves little to no purpose and is either there for being a certain animal or for just existing.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this a 2 out of 10 and not a 1 out of 10 is because the animation is tolerable. But other than that, this movie is not good.<br/><br/>And before you use the ""Oh it's just a kids movie"" or ""The kids loved it so I loved it"" excuses, let me say this. I watched Finding Nemo day one, and I keep coming back to that masterpiece 13 years later. And apparently, that's just a dumb kids movie as well."

","The Secret Life of Pets is a very family friendly, warm and fun movie. It has less of the tiresome pop-culture gags in it than some other animated releases, keeping the humour within more traditional themes as say an older Disney movie might do which renders it very suitable for anyone of any age.<br/><br/>The story follows a group of downtown New York city pets, two of whom run into some trouble during their routine ""walkies"". There's not much more to it than this, aside from the micro plots in each quick-fire set piece and the introduction of (perhaps a few too many) other animals but it is for kids and it does well to keep their attention for the ninety-odd minutes.<br/><br/>It features great vocal performances and nice (if unadventurous) animation. You won't see anything groundbreaking in this movie and it is unlikely to be one that's talked about much as time goes on, as it is weaker than the likes of How to Train Your Dragon or The Incredibles but if you're looking for a child friendly trip to the movies, this is arguably a good choice.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge animation fan (if you take a look at my other reviews) but I did not feel hard done by after seeing this one."

","I absolutely never go to the movies. I can't even remember the last movie I saw in a theater but I was super excited to see The Secret Life of Pets with my nieces. The movie started out really cute and even provided a few laughs. It was actually focusing on things that pets really do and what they just might do when we are away. The dog is giddy with happiness when his person comes home, the cat is aloof and knocks things off of shelves...just like a cat. I thought that was great and was expecting the rest to be similar. When the owner brings home another dog, which was very early in the film, he looked like he was going to be a happy dumb dumb giant lovebug but he turns out to be a bully who threatens the existing dog and I was instantly disappointed in the direction the story was headed. The negativity quickly escalated as the dogs get lost, fight alley cats, get caught by the dog catchers, then get mixed up with the angry ex-pets who live in the sewer system. The entire story after this until the end when the owners came home was so disenchanting I was basically pouting, (and yes, I am an adult.) The action sequences were too fast-paced and didn't have much substance. The sewer animals were voiced in a way that was so cliché and unappealing. I was seriously considering leaving but had my nieces with me. They weren't even amused and they are 9 and 11. This movie had so much potential but went in the wrong direction after the first 10 minutes. I don't think the ridiculous story they came up with is anything like what my pets would secretly do when I'm not home."

I loved watching Max and Duke and Gidget's individual personalities and styles and preferences; they were so cute and funny and of course, adorable!<br/><br/>Too bad this was all overshadowed by a level of violence that was base and all but humorless from my perspective. It seemed the violent chases that included everything from chaos on the road to physical animal battles were included only as fill time for the movie; the level and amount and intensity of the violence really detracted from the plot in my humble opinion, and made me wish I hadn't brought my 3 yr old to see the film."

","It'd be an insult to toddlers to call this film toddler-fodder, that is how pathetically cliché and unoriginal it is. Let's get everything out of the way shall we? The animation was mediocre, the concept utterly banal, the humor non-existent and the depth, well there was no depth.<br/><br/>Yes it is an animated movie primarily aimed at children but are children nowadays so dumb as to accept such mindless drivel, to think this as entertainment? How far the animation standards have fallen or perhaps I should say how far audience intellects have fallen!<br/><br/>The animation quality is so third-rate. You'd think the movie was made years ago. The CG is just awful. There is no intelligent story. In fact there is no story. It is just almost an hour and a half of copy pasted scenes from better movies, highly unoriginal. A C-movie Toy Story with talking animals, lacking the wit, heart, humor and all-age spanning wonder of the Toy Story films. It borrows heavily from many films, not just Toy Story but the likes of Bolt, The Incredible Journey and Homeward Bound, Garfield: The Movie and 101 Dalmatians with snippets of several other films mixed in but less endearing. In fact it is closer to Garfield, almost identical sans a few tweaks. Basically, dog gets jealous of another dog, they get lost, learn to work as a team and happily ever after with other animals trying to help them. The character development is non-existent and the little bit that is there exceeds acceptable clichés. The laughs are practically non- existent. I laughed once or twice at most. The theater-goers laughed once or twice. The minions short before the movie was funnier and more likable than the feature it was preceding. <br/><br/>The only saving grace for this film is the talented voice cast who are utterly wasted. <br/><br/>Let's be honest, this film is a shameless cash-grab. The ads for pet companies and other Illumination Entertainment films within the film are eye-roll inducing. Only the most staunch of pet lovers will adore this because they are clouded by affection for their pets instead of really seeing what a dumb film this is, overlooking how bad it actually is. People like pets, so using that psychology to goad the public is a clever move to create an undeserving blockbuster. I love animals but I dislike idiotic movies whose only purpose is raking in the money! It was beyond juvenile and such a sad waste of potential. It could have been good but unfortunately it was poorly executed in the name of box-office cash-in.<br/><br/>There are better animated movies out there, in fact Illumination Entertainment have made films several times better than this one. Please do yourselves a favor and watch something else because you've probably seen this movie before since it copies so many films already out there."

I do believe that we can deal with tough issues with children but especially in our society today I believe it's VITAL to teach children less violent ways to solve problems.

If you do, don't even bother watching this film: it's the same content, just with more product placement and film references.<br/><br/>The characters were laughable, but probably not in the way the script writers intended them to be. At the beginning, both Max and Duke seem genuinely malicious. They snarl at and threaten each other, asserting authority with brute force and abusing their ignorant owner's power. And Gidget? I couldn't even tell if she was a dog or just one of those fluffy key chains you can buy for a pound.<br/><br/>Actually, the earlier mention of script writers creating this mess is completely ridiculous. I wouldn't be surprised if this plot was the result of a lunchtime chat, or a drunk late-night gathering. The plot itself, along with drawing parallels to dozens of other movies, confuses the story of loyal dogs trying to return home with the advert break between TV shows. You thought you couldn't get enough of those damn minions? Well, they're back, where you least expect them. Yes, even in a completely unrelated film, you will be force- fed those yellow things, whether or not you liked them. Thank you, Illumination. Please, please keep milking the minions. It's the best you're going to achieve, if the movies you create in the future are as good as this one. And no, Illumination doesn't stop there, it will also shove towards you the embarrassingly obvious GoPro and YouTube logos as well.<br/><br/>Overall, The Secret Life of Pets was underwhelming, predictable, and, if anything else, pitiable, with its one redeeming factor being the quality of water surface animation, so I give it the generous rating of 5/10."

","The Secret Life of Pets lacks the gut busting laughs of Illumination's other features and unfortunately adds nothing new to the animation genre. Without any real heart or memorable characters, even for pet lovers, it will likely end up being disappointing and forgettable.<br/><br/>Centering a Toy Story style plot around a group of pets in New York City sounded intriguing, and the trailers even hooked me in a bit. Sadly, the trailers already featured most of the film's funny surprises. People with pets, and particularly dog lovers, will get a kick out of some of the various gags throughout, but there's no substance here at all. It's quite simply a Toy Story rip off with pets that doesn't even really try to be anything else.<br/><br/>With that said, the voice talent is impressive here. It follows the similar pattern of animated films getting Hollywood stars to sell the movie rather than getting true voice talent. But at least most of the cast is made up of actors with stand-up background. Jenny Slate, Louis C.K., Steve Coogan, and Kevin Hart are just a few of the voices who lend their comedic talent to the picture. Hart and Slate have quite a few humorous moments, but I can't say I really cared about the story they were in. Unfortunately, that's all film ends up being, a bunch of mini gags with pets without a story to grab onto. <br/><br/>I was also hoping the film would take advantage of its wonderful New York setting a little more. Having Taylor Swift's 'Welcome to New York' play as the camera pans around the gorgeously animated NYC parks and landmarks was a great way to open the film, but that was about as good as the film got. <br/><br/>It's difficult to truly care about what's happening when there's nothing more to the characters than dull rip-offs of Disney creations. It's not just that the characters of Max and Duke are undoubtedly rip-offs of Woody and Buzz. But you can pretty much go through the entire character list and point to who they are in Toy Story, not to mention just how closely the story follows events of Toy Story 1 and 2. Sure, you get a few chuckles here and there with talented voices leading the way, but the story is derivative and the direction is weak. Which basically just accounts to one uninspired film. <br/><br/>+Voice talent<br/><br/>+Gorgeous animation of NYC<br/><br/>-Uninspired story/Toy Story rip-off<br/><br/>-No heart or substance<br/><br/>-Utterly predictable<br/><br/>4.9/10"

It isn't. I don't know what sick twisted mind thinks this is good family entertainment. <br/><br/>Starts off amusing, nice animation, cute characters, it's basically what the trailer showed us. I started grinning already when the two main characters didn't get along, but when they get out of the house, the things get really twisted. They loose their id tags and run into dogcatcher and a ""lost pets gang"" and go down to sewers.<br/><br/>There's a lot of detailed talk about pets killing their human owners, with a blender, the discussion comes up twice and is really long. The lead characters are made to act ""tough"" and they make up horrible stories the ""gang leader"" disturbingly enjoys. Then there is a scene where a pet literally beats out answers from another. A lot of scary action, cute bunny turning scary hostile etc etc.<br/><br/>I don't know who this film is for really. Kids don't need to see and think of this stuff as entertainment. Kids don't need to think about murders. They don't and I'm pretty sure the whole idea went over their head, because it's not how kids think - thank god. But why feed them this hostile crap?<br/><br/>What eventually made us stop watching was the snake in the sewers. My 7 yo said he doesn't want to watch anymore and I agreed.<br/><br/>I'm sure the ending is all nice and friendly (atleast I hope so), but I really really despise the idea that you can do what ever to create dramatic structure in the movie, just to sort of make up for it in the end with a ""good message"" (I don't know if there is one tho). At that point the film makers have already served the ideas to kids so you can't take them away anymore.<br/><br/>You can do a proper - dramatic, even scary - kids movie without the themes served in this movie.

I wasn't aware that Max was being voiced by Louis C.K., or that Snowball was voiced by Kevin Hart. These are 2 Hollywood stars who don't rank very high in my books, and without knowing that they were part of this cast, I could sense still, the shortcomings of both their characters.<br/><br/>The directing and direction this movie took was choppy, ridiculous, even for an animation about pets, and at points, boring, which would explain all the unnecessary turns taken in this film to keep it fresh perhaps. Even as a dog lover, I couldn't connect with any of the pets, and at no point did this film manage the ""warm and fuzzy"" effect.<br/><br/>A pig, lizard and bunny hijacking an incessant animal control duo, that appears everywhere and anywhere just at the right time - and not in that ""meant to be funny kind of way"", no, they're just Animal Control that just keeps popping up, going after 2 dogs ONLY, in ALL of New York City AND Brooklyn... Being hijacked by a pig, lizard and bunny!<br/><br/>An entire community of sewer strays, blocking The Brooklyn Bridge, after a bunny and a dog stole a bus... A friggin' bus. This is stupid because, this movie is set in a world where humans are not oblivious or ignorant to such and animals are expected and only known to behave like how animals realistically and normally behave, however, hey... A crocodile is getting a beat down from a little white fluffy Pomeranian on The Brooklyn Bridge, and not a single human finds this rather peculiar at least? OK.<br/><br/>All that aside however, what disappoints me the most about this film is its well written but at so many points, either badly executed or just shy of well executed, lines.

Not wanting to spoil the movie, but to state my favorite sight/sound-gag, think: TURTLES. <br/><br/>Thankfully, most of the jokes were for humans my size, but dang, were they old references. There's a point of gearing a cartoon to please both kids and adults, but this felt like it was written in the early 90s. Eh, still, it made for some great humor and laughs out of me.<br/><br/>Apparently, you don't know your pets take on human qualities when you're gone and these NYC apartment building pets know how to party during your work hours. But, there has to be a plot to stretch this from a cute 5- minute YouTube video on the premiseso two dogs go missing and their friends, rebels and more are out to find them.<br/><br/>While there is a TON of cool shots in this movie, sometimes a tad overly convoluted, the film is hardly original. I've seen ALL of this before and that said, I still had a great time. There were enough jokes, great animation and adventure to keep up the pace. <br/><br/>You can tell, even with the said old script, the animators loved making this film. The details were amazing at times and there was a ton of heart in the making of this. When, in the same year, the lazy and sad production of Norm of the North comes out, it's refreshing to get back to what makes animation greatagain.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: In prep for my favorite month of the year, October, in less than 20 days, I've been catching up on a ton of horror movies.

","It is no secret that the animated flick ""The Secret Life of Pets"" hit box office bonanza. And why not? It was a fun movie about the crazy antics that happen to pets once their owners leaves their cribs. Our main dog here is Max (voiced by Louis C.K.), who becomes very jelly when a new dog Duke (voiced by Eric Stonestreet) joins the household. Max and Duke first duke it out for main pet ownership of the house; but then zaniness follows and they have no choice to team up and try to defend themselves against an evil anti-human stray animal clan led by a vociferous bunny named Snowball, brilliantly voiced by Kevin Hart. There are many more Pet Shop Boys in the picture that provide opportunity for laughs; including other dogs, a parrot, cats, etc. So I am not going to pet you more plot points and let you fetch this movie for yourself. Sure, there are some scenes that are over the top with slapstick outrageousness, but ""The Secret Life of Pets"" still deserves a viewing feeding. **** Good"
"kevin_newdirections","6","1","2","7 September 2016"," A Toy Story for Pets
","A Toy Story for pets. There, I've gotten it out of the way – the classic Disney film that every critic will mention in reviewing Yarrow Cheney's and Chris Renaud's The Secret Life of Pets. Perhaps cracking early the plot resemblance spoiled my high hopes for this film. We have two rival dogs vying for pet owner Katie's attention, a Jack Russell terrier Max (Louis C.K.) and a huge shaggy mongrel Duke (Eric Stonestreet) – the Andy, Woody and Buzz Lightyear in this version. The clash of these two mismatched dogs leads them at the mercy of 'The Flushed Pets', a gang of sewer-dwelling, human-hating animals led by a fluffy sociopath bunny Snowball (Kevin Hart) – yet again similar to Toy Story 3's group of road-abandoned toys led by Lotso bear. Max's disappearance sets his cutesy neighbor toys, I mean, pets to go for an adventure all over New York City in the hopes of finding him. The Secret Life of Pets just aims to be a fun, harmless, kiddie movie and it easily achieves that goal. Standing next to Toy Story, however, this appears to be the less remarkable model.<br/><br/>The first trailer of this film went viral before and it promised something different: the simple proclivities in the life of domesticated animals – an obese tabby cat raids the remaining contents of a fridge, a dachshund uses an electric mixer to give himself a back massage, a seemingly innocent poodle head-bangs to System of a Down, and so on. These scenes may be smaller in scope but it generates more excitement. To my surprise, the teaser trailer is actually what transpires in the first ten minutes. When the film starts to send the pets to the metropolis, only to follow a highly- derivative story- line, I would rather have them stay inside the house and continue their silly lifestyles.<br/><br/>Sure enough, the plot rip-off from multiple films (aside from Toy Story, I also got vibes of Stuart Little 2, Babe: Pig in the City and even Fight Club at some point) results to a disjointed film. The friendship between Max and Duke is hastily built around a dream sequence of dancing wieners or what could have been an unintended and subtle promotion to the upcoming Sausage Party. The half-heart attempt for Duke's character development goes nowhere in favor of a crazy car chase. (I'm getting tired of animals knowing how to drive cars at their first try. It only works in the Looney Tunes universe.)<br/><br/>The Secret Life of Pets remains to have a high-appeal for children and avid pet-lovers, but it's lacking the big underlying social allegory that only adults can get. The viewing experience is tantamount to watching cat videos – it's a healthy dose of distraction but it also leaves no recollection of substantive material. Sadly, this is not the secret life that I was expecting of.<br/><br/>Full review: http://goo.gl/lEPZmN"

The arrival of Katie's new pet dog Duke and Max's jealousy of him is also funny as well as realistic.<br/><br/>To me, the plot about the rabbit and the other animals trying to control the Animal Control truck is where I started to feel bored.

We had two kids with us and they were not amused. There was a bunch of about 20 kids behind us and I don't recall hearing any laughter!

"danielharden","5","3","13","10 July 2016"," The IlluMINatION Station presents: Dog Story
","Welcome to the Illumination station, home of the Minions and this new animated feature... But mainly the Minions as is made perfectly clear. Secret Life of Pets is the animated film that animal lovers everywhere have been waiting for. The film is one for the kids and has some small references for adults making it, in my book, an fairly average family film.<br/><br/>Deriving its story from Pixars Toy Story, Secret Life of Pets tells the story of Max (Woody) who lives in harmony with his owner Katie (Andy) until one day, Katie brings home another dog, Duke (Buzz) who rivals Max. The two have a falling out get lost and must make their way home... Literally the story of Toy Story. The big issue I have with this film is that it is rather unoriginal and easy to come up with in terms of story and jokes. The humour of the film relies heavily on two things; 1) basic slapstick and destruction and 2) funny things animals do that owners can relate to. If you are an animal person then you will love this film, but if you are like me and have no pets then you may like or hate it.<br/><br/>This film has many characters. Although there are many characters, it is hard to find any interesting ones. Max and Duke are plain and boring as there really isn't much too them. In Toy Story Woody had control issues and Buzz lived in a fantasy world which made their characters rather interesting whereas in this Max and Duke are just normal dogs. The best character in the film is by far Pops the paralysed dog voiced by Garth from Waynes World. Pops has the best lines and his cynicism made for some universally funny jokes and a character you would remember.<br/><br/>Illumination made the Minions movie and this film suffers from the same plot issues as the Minions movie. The films series of events is hectic and all over the place. Although not as bad as the Minions Movie, Secret Life of Pets does suffer from a lack of focus. This lack of focus is what makes this film engaging for children but too hyperactive for adults.<br/><br/>Overall Secret Life of Pets is for animal lovers. If you have a pet or pets or simply love anything about animals or Minions then you will enjoy this film. But from my point of view the film is hectic, over populated with simple characters and unimaginative. Animal lovers rejoice!"
"CraigsCritique","6","2","8","4 July 2016"," Entertaining Enough for Kids, But Adults May Be Left Wanting
","The Secret Life of Pets should come under the banner of 'a good concept yet not fully developed'.<br/><br/>There's no doubt it certainly recycles the old story arcs of the Toy Story films, firstly the premise of what pets do when you're not there (so it just replaces toys for animals) additionally it features a main character taken aback by a new arrival, the main character then tries to get rid of said new arrival & then they both get stranded & have to find their way back home...sound familiar? Additionally there is a moment in the storyline where a character recalls his relationship with a former owner akin to what Jessie does in Toy Story 2 therefore the similarities continue in pushing those buttons, now the problem of doing this of course is that you are setting yourself an impossible task to match up to & when they clearly didn't have the same quality of care involved in it in my opinion it isn't going to win over an adult audience who has seen it done so much better, but then again does it have to? The Secret Life of Pets is certainly very passable as a purely kids film and there is enough frantic animation, cute characters and humor kids of a certain age will no doubt connect with.<br/><br/>Now in terms of the voice talent involved Louis C.K plays our main lead animal Max & although he does a capable job he certainly gets overshadowed by a couple of support performances, namely Jenny Slate who plays Gidget & for me was very entertaining and without doubt the standout character on show, Albert Brooks who plays Tiberius a pet hawk also does some good work & Kevin Hart gets a showcase opportunity as the rather psychotic rabbit Snowball, beyond those performances though I felt the voice-work was a much of a muchness.<br/><br/>As I've said some of the storytelling is recycled, but also some of it is clearly chaotic in terms of that the film seems to be briefly focused one minute and then gets distracted with some other antics the next, now that can be fine as long as those antics are entertainingly worthy of diverting from the original storyline but it treads a very fine line in doing this.<br/><br/>The animation itself is vibrantly colorful and engaging to look at, but then again these days with a decent budget (as this film does have to the tune of $75million) that is not too difficult to achieve.<br/><br/>There are some nice comic observations on our relationships with our pets and I certainly laughed numerous times throughout but more in the vain of smirks and sniggers rather than belly laughs.<br/><br/>I do think that there was a lot of potential with this premise of a film and certainly feel that it has been a opportunity missed to be a truly great animated film, but as I've said previously it is certainly not a a bad film and it is extremely passable as an entertaining kids film but I do struggle to make a convincing case beyond that general consensus.<br/><br/>On a side note I really didn't need that unfunny Minions short film prior to the main feature, it utterly reeks of pure commercialism & audience grabbing bait on Illuminations part in order to garner more of an audience for the main film.<br/><br/>Now I've not done this for a while sooooo.....Hello to Jason Isaacs."

","The best parts of this movie are all spoiled in the trailer, and I barely laughed at any of the jokes (or smiled for that matter). As soon as the first 10 minutes went by, I knew exactly what was going to happen, and I was correct (which doesn't usually happen). It is a cheap rip-off of Toy Story if I have ever seen one. It baffles me that this made so much money, and it saddens me that not even half of the money this movie got didn't go to Kubo and the Two Strings, a far superior summer animated movie from 2016. The animation is not bad, I will admit, but the human designs look no different than Illuminations other human characters (tiny eyes, big noses, skinny legs). I was in a depression when I saw this movie and honestly, I felt more depressed leaving than I did entering. I was 11 when I saw this, so I was the perfect demographic. This is the worst film I have ever seen. I apoligize if this doesn't help you."
"MartinHafer","6","1","3","7 August 2018"," Incredibly uneven
","""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a very successful film from Universal, the same folks who brought us the ""Despicable Me"" franchise. While I am thrilled that the studio decided to do something other than yet another sequel, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a highly uneven movie.<br/><br/>The story starts off terrifically well. The opening sequence is simply breaktaking--with some of the best CGI you'll ever see. I was very impressed with this...as well as watching all the various pets acting like pets. However, the film simply did not maintain this momentum. Once the two dogs, Max and Duke, got lost...so did the story. The notion of human-hating animals living in the sewers and stealing dog pound trucks is pretty lame....and unappealing...especially when they talk about murdering people. Instead of being cute like the film had been, it tries to get edgy and it misfires and is not really appropriate for young kids. This will sound weird, but the film was much better when it had little in the way of plot. That's one of the reasons I loved ""Minions""-- because it was less wedding to plot and more to fun and silliness. Overall, an uneven film that becomes somewhat tiresome after a while. It starts off amazingly...then quickly loses momentum"
"zimmerblake","5","1","3","9 May 2017"," Is this supposed to be for kids?
","So this seemed like your average kids movie for a good amount of time. Nothing special about it and very predictable (Kevin Hart's character is small and energetic, shocker!). Some good includes quality animation and a fun soundtrack. Some bad includes Louis C.K.'s voice, which is known for being matter-of-fact and passive, and that does not work at all in an animated movie with as much action as Life of Pets. He tries to add some flavor but it just doesn't work and comes off sounding like he's reading straight from the script for the first time. Kevin Hart is the exact same character he is in every movie except animated as a bunny. Anywho, the story is a bunch of chase scenes and then some dogs find a sausage factory and this is when it gets weird. The sausages come to life and start committing full-on suicide as they willingly dive into a dog's mouth. It's the most messed up scene I've ever seen in a kid's movie. The dogs are supposed to be ""meat drunk"" and it's all a hallucination but still: This kid's movie has a scene where characters line up to kill themselves or be murdered by having their heads bitten off (all of which is fully depicted). I can't tell how many picked up on this or simply didn't realize it because they thought they were watching a PG movie but I was just thrilled."

I'm actually shocked about how awful this film actually was. Considering it was made by the same film firm you created the Despicable me franchise this film was the biggest disappointment of 2016. I'm not saying it was all bad and I'm sure little kids might enjoy it but I honestly think it was just weird and at times a little dark, I don't think any form of animal abuse belongs in a kid's film and certainly shouldn't be played for laughs."
"ken-35957","10","1","3","9 September 2016"," Film Meaning Review - Secret Life of Pets
","By Ken Standfield, Film Meaning Specialist. Film Review. September 9th, 2016<br/><br/>Movies are entertaining because they have meaning. That meaning has the power to change our perception, how we view others and sometimes our very lives. We watch films for their meaning. Yet so often, reviews are about scripts, actors, sets, special effects, music and other more tangible parts of the film. Yet, it is the meaning, that connects an audience with a film and makes it immortal or a failure. As a Film Meaning Specialist, my job is to share the different meanings and morals of a film so audiences can get more value from the films they watch.<br/><br/>The Secret Life of Pets is a film literally filled with meaning. We spotted 20 meanings, and there are more. In this film review, there are no spoilers.<br/><br/>Message 1: Jealousy happens when supply is limited. Moral: When two fight over the full attention of a 3rd party, things get ugly, competition occurs and aggression follows.<br/><br/>Message 2: Size and strength gives power, temporarily. Moral: The stronger opponent can be fierce and intimidating until they are out- thought and out-positioned by a more intelligent rival. People are intelligent and will find a way to use size and strength against you.<br/><br/>Message 3: The one in charge is in charge, temporarily. Moral: A dominant individual who uses fear to punish those around them, will control others for a time, but not forever. Seek cooperation and understanding to avoid retribution.<br/><br/>Message 4: Done by accident or on purpose? Moral: A goal achieved by accident counts as much as a goal achieved by planning and deliberate thought. If an accident gives the right outcome, pursue it.<br/><br/>Message 5: The threat of punishment gives you power over others, temporarily. Moral: A weaker party can control a stronger party through the threat of punishment. However, when abused, the stronger party will reassert their dominance.<br/><br/>Message 6: Abuse creates revenge. Moral: Abusing and mistreating others will eventually cause revenge.<br/><br/>Message 7: Strength in numbers. Moral: Seemingly weak parties become strong when they cooperate together. If you are weak, increase your followers.<br/><br/>Message 8: Similarity creates connection. Moral: Common ground (shared experiences) can be used to create a bond with hostile parties. Find the similarities to eliminate the differences.<br/><br/>Message 9: Desperate people lie. Moral: Desperate people lie to avoid punishment.<br/><br/>Message 10: Emotional connection energises. Moral: To get help an emotional bond and emotional connection needs to exist. The stronger the bond, the more help that is freely given.<br/><br/>Message 11: Acting against instincts is difficult, but possible. Moral: Instinctive reactions can be managed, but it is difficult and a struggle – until new habits form.<br/><br/>Message 12: Connection creates loyalty. Moral: To have loyalty, you must be first emotionally connected. Likewise, an emotional connection creates loyalty.<br/><br/>Message 13: Lies have no detail. Moral: Continue to ask for ever increasing detail when confronted with a story you think is a lie. Lies have no detail, so the story will change over time, or clearly show itself as false.<br/><br/>Message 14: Lies have an expiration date. Moral: The truth cannot be buried. Lies are temporary and always uncovered.<br/><br/>Message 15: Mutual enemies create cooperation. Moral: My enemy's enemy is my friend. We see this message play out in global politics all the time. Sometimes, your enemy's enemy becomes your enemy again. Be careful with enemies.<br/><br/>Message 16: Know the one who knows as many people as possible. Moral: To get to your goal sometimes you need help. Find the one with highest access to information and knowledge to help you get what you need.<br/><br/>Message 17: Knowledge is more powerful than strength. Moral: Handicaps when ignored and when intelligence and knowledge are leveraged are no longer handicaps. Proof: Stephen Hawkins.<br/><br/>Message 18: Don't think negatively, get the facts. Moral: Negative thinking prevents the truth being known and creates inactivity and stagnation. Keep moving. Question the negative thought and get the facts. Good or bad, the outcome is not important, getting the facts is the outcome.<br/><br/>Message 19: We stall to avoid pain. ""Let's have a long talk about why you think I am stalling."" So cute, but so powerful a message. Moral: Avoidance of pain slows or stops you from finding the facts. Ignore negative voices and focus on getting the facts, whatever they are.<br/><br/>Message 20: The power of love is the strongest force in the universe. Moral: Love gives life meaning and purpose. To get love, give love. Dogs are especially gifted at giving love.<br/><br/>We hope you have found these messages of value.<br/><br/>Ken Standfield is a film meaning specialist who explores and shares the ideas, concepts, morals and messages in films to assist audiences get the maximum value possible out of the investment they make in watching movies.

","It had it's moments of cuteness, but the creepy, nasty animals that live in a sewer that hate with cringe-worthy depiction, out to get owners, is over the top. And the most violent animal, the leader, they chose a black person to portray as the the violent gangster role!) (Seriously!) Very racist. I also hated the over-sized sloppy dog who was very unlikeable. The other dogs were cute. The little bird was adorable but hardly got any screen time. The visuals of the NYC background were absolutely awesome. The storyline is sometimes redundant, making it boring. Despite this, I'm still glad I went.

"FelipeCarrillo","6","1","3","21 July 2016"," Toy Story With Pets
","""The Secret Life Of Pets"" does not obtain the reflective level of films from Pixar or Dreamworks, nevertheless , it can entertain at least most of the movie. The analogies with the ""Toy Story"" franchise are relevant, this causes the originality is reduced to a couple of jokes and an incredible animated landscapes, detailed with realistic, brilliant and vivid colors. Pets' Story' pretends to be a recycled version of the animation classic, same narrative theme, same characters, same relationships, worse results. Story is a sophistry - but, we knew its plot - however, the film benefits of the vastness of oral and visual jokes, the connection between the protagonists, its screenplay and its professional cast of voices to entertain children and amuse to adults.<br/><br/>Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud conceive an urban environment as compelling as soul of the pets, but the charm is inversely proportional until to fall in state of trance, in generic state, a linear state. It is a child product, but we cannot underestimate children, they need beneficial films and last production of Illumination does not offer it. Taking advantage of recurrent formulas and few surprises, the characters give life to the project, not with the same satisfaction of toys, nevertheless, they make sacrifices to achieve it.<br/><br/>Max (Louis CK) modestly lives with his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) in a homey apartment in the center of Manhattan. What does Max do when Katie is not at home? Every morning, the adorable canine waits anxious and impatiently at the arrival of his owner, but he enjoys hour by hour with his friends of the building, other pets that do the same like Max; a self-centered and gluttonous cat called Chloe (Lake Bell), a distracted and grouch pug called Mel (Bobby Moynihan), a film bird and even a relaxed and unworried dachshund (Hannibal Burress). Ideal life for a domestic animal, unlimited food, friendly friends, a comfortable bed, a perfect owner, but what would happen if they aren't two plates of food, three plates of food at home?<br/><br/>Max has the drama of a only child, after Katie decided to adopt to Duke (Eric Stonestreet), a huge dog coffee; from there, the similarities with the film's toys are visible, two different beings who must join forces later a dispute between the two animals - I am amazed, it is the same premise -, they are defenseless in the real world, outside. Their enemies are a weak point which is added to the weaknesses of the film. The contrast of a cute white bunny (Snowball, Kevin Hart) with a wicked and vengeful rabbit is somewhat curious and very fruitful for the development, nevertheless, its ending is vain and unfinished, it did reduce consistency and weight to the story line.<br/><br/>Delicate it is observe that the prominence of the support characters was bigger than the main characters, as in the case of Gidget (Jenny Slate), madly in love for Max. She seeing that her platonic love does not return of the walk with his dog walker, she is alert and leaves to see her side most aggressive in order to rescue him, for this, she assembles one special squad and they take the path, an acceptable adventure. A girl in search of her lost brave prince, this plot works better than the 'copy and paste' from the main.<br/><br/>Illumination compensates for the lack of narrative originality with accustomed visual aspects of its movies, a sausage factory full of colors and charm curvatures, an alleyway with clothes hanging out on a rope and even sewers inhabited by stray animals are representations of the potential behind the minds of the company. Despite its visual magnetism and its auditory knowledge, it falls severely on the monotonous twists and predictable moments.<br/><br/>""The Secret Life Of Pets"" wasted millions of opportunities, starting with a good story to tell; With what we saw, we wish that the life of our pets were a secret. Continuous laughs and sparkling graphics do not cover to the slow-paced of the film, nor vanish a history already narrated. It accomplishes the unique and poor function of a summer movie, entertain, nevertheless, we would have wished a product more beneficial. Pets had not to leave of their houses and their movie neither, one funny mistake but disappointing."
"snarkyphilo","6","1","3","21 July 2016"," The Secret Life of Pets....not bad?
","Much of this film hinges on a combination of cute animal slapstick primarily and character interactions a close second, worked through a premise established in films such as Toy Story (which did it better), and the typical animation style and characteristics common to the latest fare from Illumination.<br/><br/>The combination works in overall conceptualization as the animation style and the character designs provide perfect vehicles of reactions and bodies for the humour which was balanced for a decent amount of the film, particularly through the secondary characters.<br/><br/>The stand out character was Gidgit (Jenny Slate) and hervigorous search for Max, particularly as a counterpart in her reactions with the apathetic cat Chloe (Lake Bell) who retains a fair amount of her stereotypical cat indifference, though shows a bit of care here and their enough to not leave her completely static. Both characters entertaining personalities and physical presence int he film- Gidgit as the leader/ass-kicker and Chloe who brought a lot of the slapstick- brought an energy to the film (though in different ways).<br/><br/>The only fault for either is the tacked on romantic drive and conclusion between Gidgit and Max at the end does feel unneeded, and Chloe wasn't given enough screen time with the other characters to form any solid dynamic except with Max and peripherally with others.<br/><br/>The film also felt like it didn't take advantage of all the possibilities it could that the premise combined with the setting of the entirety of Manhattan and the variety of characters presented.<br/><br/>In fact, it likely would have probably benefited from a more slice of life style sticking perhaps within the apartment building itself, which held even more potential which was only touched upon in part in the film, there was a lot of untapped narrative and plot potential there.<br/><br/>A little over the first half of the film in particular is where the most entertainment is found, though once you get into the later end, it begins to unravel somewhat. Transitions between moments become a bit less fluid and bit more jarring without what felt like a few small necessary moments to make the conclusion flow more solidly. the second half, or to be generous, the last third, feels like a rushed and somewhat half-assed need to wrap it all up.<br/><br/>Overall the film has some decent comedy and characters, but it suffers from only taking a shallow approach to the depths that its premise combined with some of the setting and characters presented. The secondary characters were good, but sharing space with the main characters left the main characters little time to establish their own engaging and believable dynamic. It leaves spectators somewhat entertained but not overly invested in the film as a whole."

","'THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS': Three Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A computer-animated kids' movie; about a spoiled terrier, that has to deal with another dog his owner suddenly brings home. The two canines go on an adventure together, in Brooklyn. The film was directed by Chris Renaud (who also co-directed 'DESPICABLE ME' 1 and 2), and it was co-directed by Yarrow Cheney (who served as a production designer on 'DESPICABLE ME' 1 and 2). It was written by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul (the two also co-wrote 'DESPICABLE ME' 1 and 2), as well as Brian Lynch (who also wrote 'MINIONS'). The movie stars the voice talents of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Lake Bell, Bobby Moynihan, Steve Coogan, Dana Carvey, Hannibal Buress and Albert Brooks. It's received decent reviews from critics, and it's also been a blockbuster at the Box Office (making over $100 million, domestically, in it's first weekend). I thought it was OK.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a very happy terrier, named Max (C.K.). Max lives very contently, with his owner Katie (Kemper), in a Manhattan apartment building. He loves his pampered life, with Katie, and while she's gone (his least favorite time of the day) he hangs out with other pets from the building. Then Katie brings home a very large (and messy) dog, named Duke (Stonestreet); that she rescued from the pound. Max is very unhappy, at Duke's sudden presence in his home, and the two don't get along. When Duke tricks Max, into running into the city with him, the two must team together (and work out their differences) to find their way back home. <br/><br/>The animation is decent, and it's a mildly funny movie. I definitely didn't find it to be too boring, or overly stupid, but there is an important message in there (about not abandoning animals) that kind of gets lost. It's like the filmmakers wanted to make a more insightful (and educational) movie, about taking good care of your pets, but then they decided to desert the idea; for cheap laughs and cheesy drama, instead. Still, it's not a bad film, it just could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc"

(The head-banging poodle). <br/><br/>Secondly, I know very well not to take animated movies seriously but I was a bit disappointed with all the talk of the pets killing their owners, and then the rabbit in turn wanting the details of it all. There was just a bit much of that dialogue. Maybe it's just the world we live in today that has jaded my mind, but seriously. It wasn't necessary for the story at all. <br/><br/>It felt way too much like Toy Story, but with a lot less heart. Gidget was the star of the show, and while I liked Max - the other characters never did that much for me. I felt the rest of the cast was pretty forgettable. <br/><br/>I felt it lacked a lot of the adult humor that we love (and yes I know it's a kids movie, but come on) and the story line was very, very flat.<br/><br/>Visually stunning, but not the best animated film. Zootopia and Finding Dory were much better."

","Here is the deal, I want you to understand that this is rated by my enjoyment of this film, which was less than I enjoyed the preview... by far. I brought my just-turned three year old daughter to see this film and wish I had been able to make a more educated decision. Throughout much of the movie the pets call each other names that my daughter has not heard used yet and talk constantly about killing someone just because they are different. I would not be as bothered if I had expected this and the film had not glossed these themes over with cute animals. These are lessons I want to teach my daughter, but not with cartoon animals that remind me of the three stooges. I would have walked out if I had not also been at the movie with family members that wanted to stay. This is the first movie my daughter has said she did not like because she was scared and she has enjoyed movies with much more logical adult themes (like the Secret of Kells where ((spoiler)) a village is pillaged by vikings). I am the type of parent that does not want my daughter watching Alvin and the Chipmunks or Power Rangers yet. I feel this movie was a mix of those two ideals, physical and annoying comedy used to catch you off guard and laugh as well as themes of violence as the only form of suspense. I would give it a 1, but I still enjoyed the exact scenes from the preview."

This movie was over the top in violent thinking especially for a kids movie. Kevin Hart is over-rated and should stick to adult movies and not family movies.

Max's idyllic life with his owner Katie is turned upside down when she brings home a giant shaggy mutt named Duke. Max tries to shake Duke, and they both end up fleeing the pound and falling in with a bunch of vengeful abandoned pets. Meanwhile all the other pets from Max's building join forces to find them.

However, the film is no Zootopia, Frozen or Toy Story. You won't become emotionally invested in the characters in the way you did while watching Toy Story, for example. Pets is actually very reminiscent of the classic Warner Brothers style of cartoons, aka Looney Tunes. Did you ever really care about what happened to the Road Runner or Wile E. Coyote? Probably not, but the show was entertaining for what it was. Slapstick carries Pets. That was obviously the game plan for this film. If you go with that framework in mind, you should be satisfied."

"scottshak_111","7","1","4","21 July 2016"," Just when you thought pets couldn't become more adorable!
","The Secret Life of Pets plays with your most sensitive area – the part that goes Awww a lot. The visual animators come up with adorable characters and wrap them up with cutesy faces that it is hard not to giggle when you find them talking to each other. Even though the concept is quite an old one, a clichéd formulation per se, this lucid animation by Illumination Entertainment makes it worthy of every nod it deserves.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS OF THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS (SPOILERS IN COVER) Characters to watch out for are so many actually, but the one that beats them all is a cute bunny named Snowball. Kevin Hart makes the persona unforgettable. His witty liners, rogue nature and contrasting mien make him outrageously adorable. The best parts are when he misses the deceased with a crying fist pump.<br/><br/>Amongst other ones are of course Max and Duke who start off on a wrong foot but end up becoming the best of friends. It is quite affectionate to see them get along after a series of unfortunate events. Chloe as the blue tabby cat is well thought of. Her abominable shenanigans are in blunt reflection of how a cat behaves in reality. She gets a proper screenplay where she delivers haughtily to every issue like a pro. Lake Bell voices her to perfection.<br/><br/>Another great character is that of Gidget, a white Pomeranian who is in smothering love with Max. Unfortunately it takes the whole movie and a hell lot of beating, for Max to actually notice her for real.<br/><br/>All the members of The Flushed Pets make the movie interesting. Though none of them are too memorable to be cherished, they still pack in entertainment galore.<br/><br/>HUMOUR There is humour alright, in little things like a poodle headbanging to Bounce by System of a Down. The secret passage of Pops, the old hound who has the hots for Chloe. Norman, the lost guinea pig, who comes out at odd intervals to deliver something funny. That Steve Coogan voice of Ozone, the Sphinx cat who happens to be the only true villain of The Secret Life of Pets. All such bits will tickle you fine. But to be really candid it isn't all that funny. Most of the funny bits were already shown in the trailer, that left the movie in some stark deprivation.<br/><br/>HEARTWARMING MOMENTS In the end we get to see the doting side of the pet-human relationship that is sure to bring a smile to your faces. Also, when a little girl finds Snowball in the end and he goes jab jab at her only to give in when she touches his head, is definitely going to melt you. It is satisfying to see him finally escape the dark side.<br/><br/>DOWNSIDES OF THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS The big downside of The Secret Life of Pets lies with the filmmakers. No matter how bad Illumination Entertainment tries, they can never do a Pixar. A sense of sentience is always missing in their work. Also, their humour has this weird way of skimming only the shallow surfaces. There is nothing genuine to their storyline either. You have a good look at it from a distance and you realize, their work always wades towards the purposeless.<br/><br/>Despite the obvious problems that Illumination Entertainment deal with in their every release, they still manage to make The Secret Life of Pets fairly delectable.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com"
"nmholland","6","1","4","13 July 2016"," A Cute Kids Film With an Over Abundance of Characters
","The Secret Life of Pets is directed by Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud and stars the voices of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Jenny Slate, and Albert Brooks. The story follows Max, a dog who loves his owner, Katie. They both get along very well, and live in a small apartment in New York City. However, Katie goes away every day (most likely to work), and Max has no idea where she goes. During this time of day, Max and all of his animal friends get together and have parties, or just have casual conversations. When Katie returns home with another dog named Duke, Max gets jealous, and his envy sends both him and Duke on a journey that gets them lost in the big city that they live in.<br/><br/>I wasn't too excited for this movie. The trailers looked decent, yes, but Illumination's last movie was Minions (2015), and we all know how great that was. Most of the voice actors working in this film are pretty good, so that was enough to drag me to the theater. I walked away just slightly surprised. The film doesn't bring anything new to the table, but it wasn't horrendous. I enjoyed some aspects of it, and didn't find myself wanting to leave the theater.<br/><br/>First and foremost; this movie directly, step by step, rips of the 1995 Pixar film, Toy Story. Nearly everything that happens in this movie happened in Toy Story, and even some elements of Toy Story 2, the 1999 sequel. At first I didn't really notice it, but once time went on, I started to realize it more and more. Each and every scene borrows something from Toy Story, and it really becomes noticeable after quite a while.<br/><br/>The best thing I can say about The Secret Life of Pets is the main characters. Despite there being way too many characters in the movie, the ones that were the most important were good. I liked Max and Duke, and their characters arcs throughout the film. I started out liking Snowball, the bunny voiced by Kevin Hart, however, as time went on, the character just started to get annoying. My favorite character was Gidget, the small white dog voiced by Jenny Slate. Her personality was very likable, and she was a very compelling character. Her friendship with Max, and her desire to rescue him really pushed the story along, and I enjoyed her character very much.<br/><br/>On the topic of characters, there was way too many. Max and Duke are the characters that the film really centered around, but the amount of supporting characters was just ridiculous. There were a few characters that were given more attention, like Gidget, and Snowball, but Tiberius, Chloe, Pops, Buddy, Mel, Tattoo, and Viper weren't, and that's just a short list compared to to rest of the characters. Many different characters could've been cut out of the film, and that probably would've improved it.<br/><br/>Most of the unnecessary characters are thrown in for attempts at slapstick comedy, and it doesn't always work. After awhile, the slapstick starts to get a bit annoying, and the movie really should just focus a bit more on the story. The attempts at humor throughout start to give the film a Tom and Jerry feel, as if you're just there to see small animals beat each other up with miscellaneous items or methods. The slapstick starts to get old pretty fast, and drags the film down by a lot actually.<br/><br/>Overall, kids will like The Secret Life of Pets, and adults will think it's a cute kids movie. I wouldn't pay much to see it ever again, if I ever did. It's a step by step rip off of Toy Story, except with animals, and I wouldn't pay more than matinée price if I were to see it."

","My daughter was looking forward to PETS as she just go herself a new rescue dog. I thought it might be fun too; it was a little. The animation was great as usual. You really got the sense that these were real live creatures. The initial storyline was a little slow to get started and when it did I thought I was watching a remake of Toy Story 2. A lot was borrowed from other things; so much for originality. The voices were okay for the characters I especially enjoyed Khloe the cat. What I really didn't care for was the villain of the film. There was some development of his character but he was just a loud talking, annoying character. Of course the human were all but window dressing and that's too bad, a little more human interaction might have helped this film."

","I don't usually go to animated movies. I drop the kids off and pick them up but I love cats and the previews had a couple of interesting looking felines so I decided to stay for this one ... It had good moments but, overall, the movie was tedious. The cats were good and the hawk was very good. The dogs were sappy and their personalities seemed more boring than interesting. Dogs are supposed to have a special connection with their humans - the humans are in the movie so little, there's no time for a relationship to develop so it's really a romp of pets on their own. For kids, that's enough. Adults are looking for a little more of a connection to identify with. I did understand the message that most pets are left alone too long during the day and that pets have become disposable, discarded when no longer useful or convenient. But adults know that already. I don't think the message was strong enough for the kids. If you're an adult thinking that this might be a funny movie - it's not funny enough, not poignant enough, though the ending is nice."

","The premise seemed cute. Who hasn't, as a pet owner or animal lover, thought about what sort of shenanigans your pets might get up to while you're away? The reality of the movie, however, was not at all cute. While some of the bits are cute, and certain characters were endearing, on the whole, this movie is repulsive, especially as something that is intended for and marketed to children. Most of the action is very violent, with little in the story line beyond this violence or the threat of violence; importantly, it is much more gruesome than one would expect from cartoon violence and nearly constant. Additionally, it is very, very crude. It is absolutely not something that I would want my children to see and I myself did not find it enjoyable, partially because it was not particularly funny, well-made, or endearing, and partially because I was concerned about all of the kids in the theater seeing and hearing what I was; I'm sure some of it went over their heads, but certainly not all of it. It saddens me that children's entertainment stooped so low."

And I heard people say that Louis CK is pretty funny and was influenced by the late great George Carlin. So I was thinking to myself ""This should be good."" So then I went with a group to see Secret Life of Pets. The film had a lot of hype and was highly anticipated, but however it didn't exactly live up to the hype. I mean, yeah there were some funny scenes in the movie, what the problem was they were already spoiled in the trailer. Now I don't mind repetition put the elements in this movie we have seen before in previous animated movies like Toy Story, one of my all time favorites since I was a child. For instance a dog being jealous of another dog taking over the household and the new dog missing his former owner. The part with the animals talking about killing their owners was inappropriate for a children's movie, especially for one like this. This movie is no way a bad film by any means but compared to other options out there like Zootopia, this movie does not offer a lot to recommend unfortunately. This became an easily forgettable film I didn't remember after a few weeks or even days. If you're an adult looking for a quality animated films give this one a skip. It's probably for the best."

","I was having dinner with my parents the other night where a plate of hamburgers suddenly disappeared. Seven beef patties vanished as we were getting other side dishes ready to go. What makes it harder to grasp is that it was in the middle of a round table, so we first tied to see where they went. Once our large Rottweiler Zoey came into the living room, we noticed that standing on her hind legs, she could have been tall enough to reach the burgers. While I have no video evidence and no one saw her, we all suspected she must have gotten to the table when we kept our eyes away while she had herself a feat.<br/><br/>There's a funny dynamic on how much people will associate animals with thoughts that are just as human as their owners. I'd be lying if I said that I never had my dog with me if I was watching a comedy, hoping that my animal could understand the jokes I was laughing at. With today's movie, voices are given to common pets, even though we've seen plenty of talking animal movies before. The Secret Life of Pets explores the thoughts of our pets and what they do when were away.<br/><br/>In the heart of New York in a high rise lives a young woman named Kate who cares plenty for her Jack Russell terrier, Max (played by Louis C.K.). He spends a lot of his time simply waiting for his owner to come home, but does communicate with other pets including a fat cat Chloe, a pug Mel, and a dachshund Buddy. When Katie returns, she also brings in a large Newfoundland that's named Duke (played by Eric Stonestreet). Though they are told to be brothers, Max immediately takes charge as the alpha dog to show whose boss.<br/><br/>The next day, Both Man and Duke get separated from their building's dog walker and start wandering the streets. Not only do they loose their collars to a deranged Sphinx cat Ozone (played by Steve Coogan), but they end up being taken by dog catchers. Before the truck can get to the pound, Max and Duke are rescued by a white rabbit Snowball (played by Kevin Hart). Their taken underground where Snowball reveals his team of other abandoned animals who are hoping to take revenge against humans. Meanwhile, a Pomeranian dog Gidget (played by Jenny Slate) is organizing a search team to find Max and Duke before their owners get home.<br/><br/>As a pet owner myself, I thought that this would be very good. Illumination Animation (The Lorax, Despicable Me, Minions) has a talent of imposing classic slapstick into their stories. There were plenty of moments that I laughed when I was reminded of stunt that seemed like something out of a Looney Tunes short. The visual gags were one thing, but Illumination is not that skilled at writing. The big problem is that The Secret Life of Pets feels like a beat-for-beat dog version of Toy Story. You can identify the same structure of the buddy story of the two that don't like each other, but are working to get home; It's Toy Story.<br/><br/>How are the characters? What's odd was that while I got into the side stories of Gidget and Snowball, it's actually the main characters that really bland and uninteresting. I cannot remember a single line from a shockingly stale Louis C.K. whose working with a script that gives him little to do except make dog jokes. Truth to be told, the biggest character is the animation, which looks nice and gives a fantasy-like of New York City while making it feel big.<br/><br/>I'll give this five Maxs out of five. The Secret Life of Pets is a movie that was made for kids (I'd say eleven and under). I didn't laugh much, but my full theater had kids and families that seemed happy. While it wouldn't be my first choice to show children, this will probably seem fine if you just want something for them to watch for an hour and a half. Pet people just might want to take their leashes and frisbees somewhere else."

Also, I usually enjoy the hidden adult humor that goes along with animated kids movies, but I was surprised when there was a lack of mature humor and instead there was mostly immature butt jokes. There was also some violence that I didn't expect, but it wasn't too harsh. The ending was slightly sad, but just how these types of movies usually are. It definitely wasn't what I had originally expected, and I probably wouldn't see it again, by choice, but if you have kids it's a flick that they'll love.

The film does a great job of capturing the funny, quirky things our pets do. I laugged several times at the hijinks the animals got into, because I've had some of those expereinces myself with my pets. The villain,voiced by Kevin Hart, was one of the best parts. His craziness and over-the-top voice acting made him one of my favorite characters. The animals' love and devotion for their owners was adorable. Overall, I'd say this has been a great year for animation. I rank this up there with ""Kubo"" and ""Zootopia."" Will it be nominated for an Oscar? Probably not, but that doesn't mean it's not good.

The animation is ok, but the character models are some of the worst I have seen in an animated movie. They're gross looking. I mean, they gave them b**th0les, for god's saked.
The characters don't have any motivation, they just do things because...I guess they have to. The ""ex-pets"" stuff in the sewer is so bad. Kevin Hart as this evil bunny comes irritating, he just screams non-sense the whole time.

The characters and story start off great and Louis CK strikes the perfect balance of the main dog voice. However, the film ""jumps the shark"" with the introduction of the absurd set of angry and fake characters with Kevin Hart's Snowball bunny. Snowball is angry, mean, and a total distraction. Terrible writing and direction here. These characters hate humans and have evil and totally unfunny intentions. Without this unwatchable middle section of angry and mean pets, the film has a great vibe and worth a watch. I've seen it about 100 times because our 4-year old loves the beginning and ending.

I didn't expect a lot from this movie, but I had a good time watching cute talking animals doing mischievous antics.<br/><br/>Not that it was terrible, because the voice work was energetic and delivered some funny jokes and the animation was nice to look at. The story, however, was pretty standard. A dog loves his owner, the owner gets another dog whom he instantly dislikes and tries to get rid of and they end up getting lost together and learn to appreciate each other.<br/><br/>But even though some side characters steal the show, the film makers went way overboard with the quantity of characters. A lot of them sadly didn't make much of an impact on the movie other than following the leaders or being one-off jokes themselves.<br/><br/>I wonder why a sequel is hitting theaters later in 2019, but what the hell, I guess TSLOP made enough money in theaters to green-light it.<br/><br/>TSLOP is fine as a time-waster, but nothing that special."

","This movie is a bit of a weird one. It does have its moments where it's a great movie for kids. But, at the same time, there's really not much about this film that makes it all that special. The visuals are colorful, crisp, and adorable, the voice acting is great, and the premise is executed decently. However, this film is literally a knock off of Toy Story. The story seems to be point blank the exact same as Toy Story, meaning that no thought was really put into this films narrative. It's like the writers saw Toy Story and said ""Yes! That!"" This is extremely lazy and the fact that this got the thumbs up is frankly kind of baffling. Not to say this is a bad film, as the story, despite being painfully unoriginal, is depicted well enough to be enjoyable, especially to kids, but it's just more recommended to watch Toy Story instead, because this is just that but with Pets instead. Toy Story is also a vastly superior film with the wit and personality that this film is lacking, so me recommending this over Toy Story is close to impossible. It's still fun and adorable, sure, but it's kind of pointless at the end of the day. Again, kids and adults may get something good out of this, as it's still an okay film, but, it's not at all the first of it's kind."

And we especially love to read human characteristics into them. The partial anthropomorphising of Max, Duke and Co. is cheating a bit - they have animal characteristics when that suits the movie, and they have human characteristics when that is appropriate - but that's no more than we do with our pets anyway, is it? And the fact that these characters can have both animal and human attributes as the story demands is not only absolutely fine, it feeds the film with charm and laughs.<br/><br/>This CGI adventure is packed with action and humour. There is a huge cast, and every character is well designed with a distinctive look and an even more distinct character - you never get the various animals confused, and every one stays true to his character throughout. The look of the film is hugely attractive, with a New York which is realised in bright colours and simplified design, but recognisably the Big Apple nevertheless.<br/><br/>But the thing which raises Secret Life above the average is the subtext. Family, camaraderie, trust, second chances - these are all issues which are addressed during the film, and never in a way which beats you over the head with moralising.

"tarasuffolk","5","0","1","25 February 2017"," The voice actors carried this movie
","Overall this movie was okay. I had no idea what the plot was going into this movie. And I still don't truth be told. The trailers made it seem like the pets did wacky stuff while their owners are away, secret stuff. Instead it was kind of like Toy Story where jealously leads to wacky adventures. <br/><br/>I'm 22 years old. I LOVE animated movies and television shows targeted at children. But I didn't like this one too much. <br/><br/>The good things: The voice actors. Louis C.K. did an amazing job. He talked like he was a dog if that makes sense. I did even know that it was Eric Stonestreet. I like the voice he used. Kevin Hart did a good job too, he put as much intensity as I'm sure he puts into his stand-up, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell, and Dana Carvey did amazing as well. Overall the voice acting was top notch. <br/><br/>The animation was bright and colorful. That's pretty important for animated movies for children. It made New York look nice and friendly. <br/><br/>There's a point where we find out that the Eric Stonestreet dog (Duke) had a previous owner and that scene is lovely. So Max and Duke somehow find the house and of course the previous owner died and that scene is nice. <br/><br/>The dog who's played by Bobby Moyniham, Mel, was my favorite. He was so cute and hyperactive. He made me laugh. <br/><br/>The score was interesting. It was kind of jazzy, I liked it a lot.<br/><br/>The bad things: The plot. It was kind of all over the place. I had no idea where it was going. First thing that happens is that Max (Louis C.K. dog)'s owner gets a new dog (Eric Stonestreet), Duke. Max is mean to him and the new dog is mean right back. Hijinks ensue as they compete for love and alpha status. Eventually Max wins and the new dog has to do what Max says for a bit. Then as they go to the park, the new dog pulls an asshole move and tries to get rid of Max. Haha kids movies amiright? The plot falls apart there. They run into crazy feral cats, then pound people, then animals that live in the SEWER because they were abandoned, then a weenie factory, and then sewer and feral cats again. The plot changes every 10 minutes to keep attention spans from running out I guess. <br/><br/>The weenie factory scene. It was bizarre and it made me uncomfortable. Max and Duke eat so many that they imagine the weenies singing 'You're the One that I Want!' from Grease. Or maybe it actually happened. I don't know. That scene didn't really make any sense to me. <br/><br/>About 25 minutes in, the bunny that Kevin Hart plays drives the city pound truck. Quite honestly that's where the movie lost me. I can disband my belief for talking animals but when they drive machinery is when it looses me. <br/><br/>The dog that Jenny Slate plays, Gidget, has a crush on Max and spends the whole movie trying to rescue him. The crush bothers me because it doesn't explain why or how she has a crush on him. She just does, no backstory. In order to save/rescue someone, apparently you need to have romantic feelings for them. <br/><br/>Most of the movie apparently takes place in one day. I don't buy it. <br/><br/>And last thing, there's so many characters. Max and his friends, Kevin Hart bunny and his gang of misfits, Gidget and her rescuing crew, the feral cats are just some characters. This isn't even mentioning all the human characters. It was too much, I can't handle it. <br/><br/>Anyway, if I was under 10 years old I would probably like it. But I didn't it and it makes me sad. <br/><br/>6/10."

","I'm going to be honest, (not that I would be anything other than honest), the trailer is the best thing about this film. It shows all the best scenes, which depicts and deceives a different story. I would have definitely liked it more if the film was just about pets at home, rather than making it into an adventure. <br/><br/>The pets, for the most part, have fun characters. Max and Gidget, are for sure my favorite two. Max is the ever loyal human's best friend, and Gidget has the most character out of all. Her persistence is admirable, and Slate does a great job with dialogue. On the other hand, the other group of pets - led by Snowball, was a bad choice for the film. When Snowball is introduced, it just brought the film down so much in my standards. I have nothing against Hart (he is a rather funny guy), but his voice and the character did not fit at all into the overall tone of the film. He is just so much more vulgar than a kids show should be, and his character was so obnoxious and loud, it made me cringe. <br/><br/>The animation itself is vibrant and colorful, which fit well with the characters. The scene settings had great detail, and the characters' movements were smoothly done. Filmmakers definitely did their research (in which they may have just observed their pets), and it was great to see the little things that dogs and cats usually do. The way Max's ears droop is so cute, and how Chloe plays with the toys around her reminds me of my cat. It was also fun how they contrasted the attitudes between cats and dogs. <br/><br/>As I said, the main issue I have with this film is the character of Snowball, and how typical the plot is. Everything else was enjoyable and cute to watch. It was just a disappointment to watch a film that promised to show what pets do at home when they're alone, but didn't deliver. Would have liked to see more of that, and more of the owners too."
"imdb-05788","5","0","1","22 December 2016"," Watchable, perhaps enjoyable but certainly a mess
","I watched this a while ago in cinema and it was a severe disappointment. Now, I did watch Inside Out and Zoomania earlier, so I was probably pretty spoiled and expecting another awesome animated movie but what the film delivered was really poor in my opinion.<br/><br/>I like the idea, a movie about pets and what they do in secret when their owners are not home. What I wanted were beautiful scenes and those I did not get sadly. Illumination Entertainment tries to be funny throughout the entire film, but fails in doing so: I could hear maybe two chuckles during the entire movie, so it was not only my lack of sense of humor or a bad day, the movie is genuinely not funny. There are a lot of ""jokes"" that get repeated too many times, each time still not making anyone move a muscle in their face. Some scenes are unnecessary and make me feel like the plot (which is loose, not smooth and confusing/made no sense to me) was not enough - not like the movie is a long one anyway - and they had to fill in some random scenes. You won't feel a lot of suspense or see many memorable scenes. I kind of like how the characters develop, of course the main development being between Max and Duke, however the characters are still flat. The climax was a big letdown.<br/><br/>You can still watch, enjoy and like this movie with your family I guess, especially if you have pets that will watch it with you :) or if you simply like the animals, but don't expect a great movie. It is a mess for me. This is of course my opinion (I like Despicable Me + 2 a lot!), but I think the ratings do go hand in hand with this feedback."

","The Secret Life of Pets, the latest cutesy, family-friendly slice of talking-animal animation from Illumination Entertainment, feels like it was written as a result of a producer stumbling upon the 'ninja cat' video from YouTube. The trailers promised a fresh spin on the usual cartoon animal antics, with the action focusing on what our mischievous but lovable pets got up to when we leave for work every morning, whether it be inviting their neighbourhood friends round for a party, raiding our fridges for chicken and cake, or using the whisk as a vibrating scratching post. It felt like we were going to get Toy Story with cats and dogs, but what we get is a 90 minute chase sequence bereft of originality and charm.<br/><br/>If you're not familiar with the company Illumination Entertainment, they're the ones infesting what feels like every advert, bill-board and internet video with their Minion characters, those yellow, bespectacled creatures from Despicable Me (2010) who inexplicably inspire laughter from many by simply making a noise, and inspiring children everywhere to demand their parents cough up money on merchandise. Life of Pets is so devoid of ideas that it would be more appropriate to label it an extended advertisement for a new toy range. The latest must-have toy is Max (voiced with an Average Joe twang by Louis C.K.), a Jack Russell terrier who loves his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper), but pines for her every day as she leaves him to sulk in the apartment they share.<br/><br/>Despite spending most of his day feeling lonely, Max is perfectly happy lapping up all the attention whenever she is home, and hooking up with his friends - fat cat Chloe (Lake Bell), pug Mel (Bobby Moynihan), dachshund Buddy (Hannibal Buress) and budgie Sweetpea - when she isn't. However, Max's idyllic lifestyle is thrown into disarray when Katie brings home a huge, shaggy rescued stray named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). A series of events unleash Max and Duke onto the busy streets of New York, where they must dodge vicious alley cats and the always- lurking pound in a bid to get home, but instead find themselves in a kind of terrorist cell for disgruntled former pets led by the maniacal rabbit Snowball (Kevin Hart). Max's disappearance alerts the smitten Pomeranian Gidget (Jenny Slate) from across the street, who rounds up the gang for a rescue mission.<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailers then you've already seen the best parts of the movie, for when the attention remains on the domestic quirks of the many animals on show, there are laughs and fun to be had. By taking the action outside of the home for the majority of the running time, directors Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud lose the hook, and events quickly devolve into almost every other audience- friendly animation not made by Pixar or Disney you've recently seen. Worse still, is that the many set-pieces aren't funny, with too much reliance on prat- falls and Kevin Hart's high-pitched squealing to generate any laughs. It's all just noise and colour and no heart, with only Slate's husky- voiced spunkiness and Albert Brooks' slightly unsettling eagle Tiberius managing to inject any life into their characters. It does little but reinforce just how good Disney's Zootopia was, and remind us how Illumination's priorities lie with how much cash is lining its pocket."

","It was hard to make it through this movie. None of the characters were likable, the plot line was bland and had nothing very original to it. A cute bunny a villain? No.. I refuse to hate him!:(. Don't worry my poor soul, as it seems as though the producers changed their minds about having such a cutey be a villain throughout the entire film, and is instead used to aid a semi-plot twist! Safe move guys! There are many reasons why I didn't enjoy this film, but I'll leave out the trivial ones for you all. First off, the producers were lazy and decided to go with a basic plot development; it's not a movie for people looking for something meaningful. There's a reason why Zootopia was a popular movie, the character's personalities have an explanation through their backstories, thus effectively explaining why they do certain things in the process; Secret Life of Pets? Everyone's life before the movie is hastily glossed over. For example, Snowball's backstory could have been explained better, maybe going into flashback, revealing a weakness that could be used against him later on. Why the characters are where they are now is also glossed over, making the characters completely interchangeable with one another. This movie might be OK if you have kids, but if you're an intelligible adult, then this story will bore you to death."

"rjkjklose","5","0","1","7 November 2016"," The Secret Life of Pets Leaves Much to Be Desired
","The 2016 animated comedy ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is directed by Chris Renaud along with Yarrow Cheney and is made by Illumination entertainment (makers of the ""Despicable Me"" franchise). The film takes place in a fictional world where animals can talk (think ""Toy Story"" but with animals) and their owners are none the wiser. Even though the films premise is extremely promising, it fails to deliver much more than adorable animals and jokes that wouldn't make a twelve-year-old laugh. <br/><br/>Without giving away any spoilers I will say that this movie doesn't exactly head in the direction showed in the trailers. Instead it takes the much easier route of being a clichéd and mundane tale centered around these characters finding their way back home. Soon after these characters start their adventure, the plot splits into two parts. There is the story of the main protagonist and the story of his love interest. The side plot involving his love interest was absolutely horrible. This side plot takes up a good chunk of the movie, yet never once did it fail to bore. This is the biggest crime that this film commits as there was an extreme amount of potential here for a creative story. Instead what we're left with is a boring shell of what we were originally showed.<br/><br/>Animation is definitely a strong aspect of this film. The movie is packed with vibrant and bright colors that match the goodwill tone of the film. Every character design fits that particular characters' personality. The characters are all particularly adorable, especially the bunny rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. Along with Kevin Hart, the film is host to an incredible cast including Dana Carvey, Louis C.K., Ellie Kemper, and many others. These voice actors do a great job of portraying their respective characters and really bringing them to life. This is especially pertinent because of the horribly simple characters within the film. That's right, unfortunately most of these characters are one dimensional and lack any sort of character development. There is the large bumbling dog, the eccentric rabbit, the mischievous hawk, and even a fat cat. These characters never reach their full potential and are otherwise useless. Never once during the film did I resonate with a single character. In fact, even the main character comes off as unlikeable throughout the film. Thankfully however, the great voice acting in the film did help to keep me engaged in the story. Otherwise however, these characters exist only to further the plot and sell toys. <br/><br/>Technically speaking, the direction and writing here get the job done and not much more. Many running jokes become tired after a few times on screen and most jokes not meant for seven-year old's simply fall flat. Actually most of the dialogue here only exists to further the movie and it becomes blatantly obvious after the first fifteen minutes that this is a movie geared towards children. Granted there were some genuinely sincere moments scattered throughout the film that really did connect. Unfortunately, those moments were too few and far between to make much of a difference. Surprisingly however, the soundtrack in this movie is excellent. There are several tracks from artists such as Pharrell Williams, Queen, Bill Williams and even the Beastie Boys. These tracks worked wonders for this film as the soundtrack is extremely engaging and is sure to get stuck in your head after just a few songs. Almost every time the music got turned up, the film became much more interesting. <br/><br/>While ""The Secret Life of Pets"" was not out to break any new ground in the animation department, it still should have been a fun movie the whole family could enjoy. Instead what we're left with is an unenjoyable film that caters specifically to young children. Though the animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and character designs are great, they are not enough to save this movie from the bargain bin at your local department store. Score: 5/10"
"KeepYourGoodHeart","5","0","1","30 September 2016"," Disappointing
","I went to see this movie in theaters after seeing all the hype about it and it started out great but I was disappointed as the movie went on. Firstly, the story line wasn't really anything that hadn't been done before so you won't be seeing anything new. Since I'm not one who watches animated films very often (in fact this was the first I'd seen in years) I was expecting something a little different.<br/><br/>Furthermore I found that for an animated kids movie it was quite harsh. Sure, there are plenty of others and cartoon violence isn't anything new, but I was somewhat shocked at the amount of threats the rabbit made against humans and other pets and the whole underground street gang thing surprised me for this kind of movie. I found it to be rather excessive for the message behind this movie. It would've been much better if they had just toned it down a little bit.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie to watch with your kids, you can skip this one."
"michael_wetherell","6","0","1","24 September 2016"," When we're not watching
","Great movie and concept! Entertaining and definitely good for a family viewing. Carried the same plot that Toy Story had, bringing a human element and mystery to what happens while people are away. <br/><br/>However, detracted from the story telling by putting the animals in unrealistic situations after trying to rationalize the characters based on their species. Would have gone a lot further by keeping the humorous realism of their situations instead of a full blown action movie with explosions, flipped cars and ultimately large scale destruction. More what we would expect from a Die Hard chase scene than a movie featuring pets. <br/><br/>All in all, good movie and definitely worth viewing."
"Troy_Campbell","6","0","1","12 September 2016"," Uncomplicated kiddie fun.
","Touted as Toy Story with animals, the latest family-friendly adventure from Illumination Studios (Despicable Me, Minions) takes a light-hearted peek behind the door at the lives of pets residing in a Manhattan apartment block. All is well for these domesticated creatures until Max (Louis C.K.), a spoilt Terrier who loves his comfy existence, doesn't return from a visit to the dog park, sparking a perilous journey throughout the Big Apple led by the indefatigable Pomeranian Gidget (Jenny Slate). The first half hour is full of laughs as we meet our eclectic group of pet protagonists, but once the trek through the streets commences the jokes dry up at an alarming rate, largely because it fails to add anything to the lost-in-the-big-scary-world formula. The characters are a mixed bag too, a few memorable ones carrying the bland other ones. The quiet ball of fury Gidget, the nonchalantly self-centred cat Chloe (Lake Bell) and the hyper-energetic bunny Snowball (Kevin Hart) leave the biggest impression. But it ticks all the right boxes to ensure kids will love it: bright and bubbly animation, a bopping soundtrack, non-stop visual gags, quotable dialogue, very few quiet moments and, in Snowball and Gidget, two pets who would be a hoot to own. Considering the potentially hilarious concept and the great opening act The Secret Life of Pets squanders it's opportunity to land in the higher echelon of animated flicks, nevertheless it's an easy, breezy 87 minutes of uncomplicated kiddie fun."
"AndiRobinson","5","0","2","18 August 2016"," It's No Minions
","I have been in two minds about whether or not to see this film. Part of me thought that this company, Illumination Entertainment, had set themselves a very high bar with any future release that they do due to the success of Despicable Me series and not forgetting everyone's favourites, The Minions. The other half was worried that maybe the best bits of the film had already been seen in the trailers. However, my Better Half really wanted to see the film. So we went.<br/><br/>The film is set around some pets that all live in a tower block in New York City. One of the Pets, Max, has an owner who adores him and MAx is very happy with their life. Then Max's owner brings home another dog. Max isn't too chuffed about this and sets about trying to get rid of the new dog, Duke. <br/><br/>A lot is made of this at the start of the film but to be honest this is over as soon as it is started. The main plot line evolves around them trying to find their way back home once they have been caught by the animal welfare team. <br/><br/>So what did I think? Well...Its OK. There is some comedic moments that are fleeting and only really make you chuckle. I guess this is more for the kids and more for those that are pet owners. Personally I am not a huge fan of pets and so I don't think this film is really for me. I do think that the best bits of the comedy had already been shown in the trailers. <br/><br/>The underground scene of the animals that had been released by their owners was an interesting twist, if not very random, I mean who has a crocodile or an aligator as a pet? It is far-fetched it is tongue in cheek, but lets be real its not meant to be realistic. <br/><br/>Will I buy this on when released on Bluray? No I won't. Its not a film that I would watch again. Is there going to be sequels probably and hopefully, like Finding Dory, it will be better than the original.<br/><br/>The Average Joe Film Review Blog: http://tajfr.blogspot.co.uk/"

","I really loved the intro part. I thought we may had a nice story. There was a great animation some soundtrack and a little character development in some of the pets even thought some might be known and proved stuff for this kind of movies. The minions parts or as i call the ""filling time stuff"" is hard to stand. That thing is getting old and some day it won't sell any more (hopefully) Will never be as good as Ice Age 1 Scrat ideas, and right now there are so many movies repeating this formula that is getting boring. Story and script could have been way way waaaay better. Instead, they offered ""proved formulas"" and boring ideas repeating it endlessly till the ""end"" and even after the end. They should have known better."
"sannive","6","0","1","4 August 2016"," Humans or pets
","While I did find the movie entertaining, I was rather disappointed to find that it was less a humored fantasy about what animals truly do when we're not around, and more of a Pets acting like humans. Sure, it is funny, you will laugh, but it is a moral cookie of human values where the animals suddenly know how to drive cars and make skeleton keys to let their friends out. So next time? Please let it be more about pets being funny on their own (as they tend to be) than humans in the disguise as pets. If I want to watch a funny search and rescue moral cookie movie there are other options that would be much more entertaining."
"budgetbabecouture","5","0","5","31 July 2016"," Not That Great
","On the previews they made this movie look so good for a family movie, but it is not. It kind of just drug on and there were parts that honestly just kind of bored me. You honestly just never fall in love with the characters and just begin to not even care if the characters work through their problems or not. All you can do is keep checking your watch hoping that it will end any minute. Most certainly not worth the $50 it took for our family to go see it. If you are expecting something with strong characters like those from Zootopia, then you will be strongly disappointed as this was painful to sit through. I thought for sure I would love this movie. Not"
"Mr-Fusion","6","0","2","25 July 2016"," The story's thin, but the cast is pretty great
","""What do our pets do when the humans are at work all day?"" That's a really good hook - something you'd expect from PIXAR, at that - and it has wide-reaching appeal. That there are gags centered on animals other than just cats and dogs means that a lot of this is accessible to just about everyone. And when ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is about that premise, it's gold. There's a wealth of stand-up talent in the cast, and the animators find plenty of behavioral humor to mine in the pets (cats, especially). But then the main characters are taken out of their home and onto an epic adventure - and this is where the movie goes straight into ""Flushed Away"" area. I was much more interested in the goings-on in the apartments than I was in the sewer.<br/><br/>But, aside from that narrative indulgence and some ill-advised song choices (there are much better odes to the Big Apple than ""Welcome to New York""), this is a decent children's movie. It's not as tight as the Despicable Me movies, or even ""Minions"", but of all the movies you can be dragged to by a kid (""Smurfs"" anyone?), it's a harmless Summer diversion.<br/><br/>6/10"

","It wasn't a bad movie, but honestly didn't have much for it.<br/><br/>It was cute and edited very well.

About 70% of the movie is what you see in the trailer. So don't expect too much.

"fromandrewvanbeek","6","0","1","18 July 2016"," The Movie is OK, but no Oscar Contender
","Overall Grade: C<br/><br/>The Secret Life of pets definitely has some funny and entertaining moments. Some of the characters are quite funny. I especially enjoyed Kevin Hart's and Jenny Slate's characters and their respective performance. However, considering the other cast, I was expecting this movie to be much funnier. It had a few chuckles, but that was it. The animation is of decent quality, though not at Disney/Pixar levels. However, the biggest failings comes from the plot. It borrows so many plot points to the point of the movie feeling like a blatant ripoff without adding any of its own, so the movie as a whole was relatively boring and predictable. It is definitely an improvement over Minions, but nowhere near as good as Despicable Me 1 and 2. Considering the amazing animated movies that have come out so far this year (Zootopia and Finding Dory), and the animated movies that look amazing and are being released soon (Kubo and the Two Strings and Moana); you probably won't be finding this on any of the Oscar shortlists."
"fdsa-26013","Null","0","3","15 July 2016"," Not as funny as I expected
","I expected this movie to be funny and cute since it was billed as being about what pets do when their owners aren't home. There were some funny parts to it but there was also a large part of the movie that was very dark. Abandoned pets living in sewers and out to kill other pets, gang initiation by snake bite, and other things really took away from the humor in this movie for me. Most modern children's movies do have a few scary scenes with mean characters but are otherwise light and entertaining. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" seemed to give too much time to the gloomy scenes and not enough to the funny parts for me and my teenage daughter to enjoy. This is definitely not one I would watch again or recommend for small children."
"tzu-chiang","5","0","9","13 July 2016"," A cute movie, but that's all.
","After I watched the trailer, I had really high hope for this movie because all those character seemed so adorable and the idea of pets' secret life was so appealing. However, after I watched the full movie, I was so disappointed.<br/><br/>The plot was rather flat, there wasn't a scene that stood out. There are lots of exaggerated action but not in an interesting way, and their dialogue wasn't funny either. As for the adventure, it was far from exhilarating, and there wasn't any moment that kept me suspend or made me dying to know what happen next. <br/><br/>Beside the plot, there are also lots of problems with the characters. First, there are way too MANY characters!! Some are not even essential or relevant to the story. Second, the personality of each character were not so distinct, no one really stood out, I can't tell which is my favorite because they were so lack of uniqueness.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's because of the timing, it's inevitable that this movie be compared to Zootopia(both feature animal animation), which makes this movie seems to be more mediocre. I'm not saying that a cartoon must have an enlightening moral lesson, but at least it must have good plot and memorable character, and both of these elements are missing in this film. <br/><br/>Overall, it's definitely a cute movie, but with nothing really going on."
"RNDorrell","5","0","9","13 July 2016"," Missed opportunity with a potentially great concept
","MILD SPOILERS INCLUDED: This review is guided by an adult viewpoint, because I think Illumination Entertainment seeks to grab for that same brass ring Pixar once held: the animated feature that could fill kids with unquestioning delight, and simultaneously raise adults' eyebrows in a knowing fashion. The kids will likely give ""Pets"" far more love than I'm prepared to, based on that assumption.<br/><br/>O.K., this was the first time I've actually gone out to see an I.E. animated feature (the Despicable Me movies). Yes, that means this was accompanied by a Minions short; I am sure that fact alone might cause some of you to squirm in discomfiture. How many Minions are there and how can we safely exterminate them en masse? After the unpleasantness of the Minions short, ""Pets"" was not bad. But it was also not anywhere near as great as the trailers had me hoping it could be, given it was graced with a great, simple ""Toy Story""-style concept: Wondering what your beloved pet animals do all day while you're off at school or work. Ohh, to be able to channel the flickering walnut-sized consciousness of beloved pets I've known: The diminutive Teddy Bubbles of Santa Monica, for instance.<br/><br/>But, alas. To borrow a baseball analogy, this was the animation equivalent of a deep sacrifice fly ball that scored a lone run, when a 4-run-rally inning is what was totally expected. Animation: 8, Voice acting: 7, Story: 5, Dialogue and one-liners: 4. The kids will appreciate it, mostly, but I liked the voice acting and the lavishly detailed backgrounds. New York City has never been bathed in this much munificent golden light, not even in ""You've Got Mail,"" that adult Manhattan fairy tale.<br/><br/>Yet, the writers badly disappointed by taking the very easiest ways out, in almost every sequence, and they also badly over-relied on gusto voice performances from actors like Kevin Hart, Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Lake Bell, and Albert Brooks (very funny as a kept raptor with a conscience about his role as a predator). Jenny Slate is terrific as a toyish-looking Pomeranian, Gidget, with a heart of gold and an edge of steel to her determination as she insists (spoiler alert) that the allied pets gear up to go rescue the missing dogs, her love interest, Max, and his recent roommate addition, the seemingly oafish Duke. Slate's voice performance is the strongest of the film, and it sets the tone for the the moral underpinning of the story: that there are good pet owners in the world, like Max and Duke's, Katie, and that every pet deserves such an owner.<br/><br/>At the blustery end of the vocal spectrum, Hart's rabbit chews more digital scenery than 10 other characters combined, and his raging is both maddeningly called-for by the vaguely unfocused script, and yet at the same time it's also a prime example of how the film fails to genuinely engage our emotions. A fluffy white bunny, emotionally conflicted about humans, leads an animal revolution, and screams so much in the process (spoiler alert) that he poops himself. Hah. Ha, hah, umm, ha. Hmm. Give those quality voices funnier, more innovative lines, and something more creative to do (spoiler alert) than keep trying to evade an NYC Animal Control van, and you've got a potential game-altering 3-run home run on your hands.<br/><br/>This one was cute, but, sadly, not really stirring, like a visually splendid birthday cake that turns out to be baked in a flavor that's just not your favorite. And this one is really not at all necessary to see before it streams. Also ... no sequel is really desired. Although, given Hollywood's by-the-reboots mentality now and the competitive nature of the animated features market, we'll likely get one anyway. And hey, in this so-far absolutely horrid year for Hollywood, this one's already a hit, it's made $80M in profit after only 5 days' run. To me, that speaks volumes about how desperately weak 2016 has so far been in film. The Infiltrator, and Ghostbusters: rescue us. Star Trek surely won't."

","i really like good animated movies. this is just so-so. the first 15 minutes or so is very good when introducing the characters and the story concept - what our pets do when we the owners are away. lots of humor. cute story line and most of what all of the ads show - the best part of the movie. I don't know if this is a spoiler but when Max and Duke get mixed up with the sewer animals, the story line goes from stupid to absurd. it's almost like there were different groups doing the story line for different parts of the movie and then the hodge-podged it together. the concept is good and cute and potentially very funny. the way the story wanders from the original concept really drags it down. I was really disappointed in the end product. I did laugh at times, there were some cute funny moments - but for every funny scene or line, there were a multitude more that were not. it's not a terrible movie, it's just not very good either."
