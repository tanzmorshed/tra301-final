","`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods."

","The action/fight scenes themselves would explain the rating I'm giving this movie! Sure some of the action scenes are over the top but not so much to take away from the film itself, so for me, it worked! I thought the French detective guy played his role nicely and so did the Asian girl. This is definitely a rewatchable movie because some of the action/fight scenes are a nicely executed."
"Rooster99","9","89","116","12 May 2003"," An excellent action movie!
","All action movies should strive to be this imaginative!  OK, the plot was not particularly intriguing, but what action movie's actually is?  But the plot was secondary to the action, it only served to make the bad guys bad and the good guys good.  The rest was up to Jason Statham's considerable fighting talents.<br/><br/>There were some unbelievable yet jaw-dropping stunts, a terrific fight scene in oil, and some great car chase scenes.  There were no smarmy one-liners making light of good action sequences as is too often the case in American-directed action flicks.  The hero was cold, yet compassionate.  He didn't kill unnecessarily, but when he had to, he was ruthless.  There are many great action sequences, some so unbelievable you have to just shake your head and remember that action movies are not supposed to be based on reality.  There is even a great shot of the hero jumping off a speeding semi while it races over a bridge onto the back of a bus going perpendicular to the truck under the bridge!!  I mean, come on!  It would never happen, but I have to give credit to the stunt coordinator who imagined the possibilities.<br/><br/>There is another hilarious scene where the hero chases down an airplane on foot, hijacks it, jumps out of the plane at great altitude in order to land on the back of a speeding transport with a conveniently located borrowed parachute!  I am glad all crop dusters carry such indispensable equipment and that it is so easy to land on the back of a truck speeding down the highway at 130 KM/hour.<br/><br/>All in all, 90 minutes of sheer enjoyment.  Even with the predictable ending, I have to highly recommend this movie.  If you can suspend belief for a little while, you will be rewarded."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","61","80","18 June 2006"," Statham & Style Elevate The Action
","I still rate this pretty high even if the last 10 minutes got totally out of hand and went crazy, action-wise. By ""out-of-hand,"" I mainly refer to the usual excessive action and bad guys-keep-missing-good guys-even-from-short range-type mentality. Actually, a lot of the film is that but it's such a fun movie that I didn't care.<br/><br/>Jason Statham is very cool in the lead and it's he that makes this a decent film. I also enjoyed Shu Qi, a very pretty woman; the witty dialog of Francois Berleand and some stylish, tongue-in-cheek directing by Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen. Another director whose films are known for their hip styles also co- wrote this: Luc Besson.<br/><br/>Some of the action scenes are outrageous. To Statham's credit, he did most of the action scenes himself. I guess he's a tough guy in real life, too. He's pretty amazing.<br/><br/>A no-brainer-but lots of fun movie."
"Captain_Couth","8","58","77","27 August 2005"," Jason Statham action star.
","The Transporter (2002) was a fun action film that was directed by Jet Li's fight director Corey Yuen and it starred Jason Statham. Jason stars as Frank Martin. He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways. His number one rule is to never ask questions. One day he takes a gig from a sleazy and shady man named Betancourt (Matt Schulze). Instead of delivering the goods, he breaks his number one rule and peeks inside the package...<br/><br/>A fun action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to flamboyant ans stylized you have to suspend belief. It's one of those movies that doesn't throw in realism all of a sudden to make the movie more interesting. Jason Statham is pretty cool as well as the Transporter and he seems legit, not another tough guy phony. HE looks like he can knock the tar out of you in a real fight. Co-stars Shu Qi (she learned to speak English phonetically for her role in this movie).<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"dee.reid","7","31","42","31 August 2005"," A few bumps mar an otherwise decent outing in ""The Transporter""
","There's no question that Luc Besson is one of Europe's biggest action producers. I mean with the cult classics ""La Femme Nikita"" (1991) and ""The Professional"" (1994) behind him, he's basically been given the green-light for every big action picture he comes across. One of his latest and most ambitious projects was ""The Transporter,"" released in 2002.<br/><br/>I have to admit this is one flick I approached with a very open mind - very open. I mean, I like Jason Statham. I think he's a pretty cool guy and at first, even I questioned his casting as Frank Martin in ""The Transporter."" But the problem is, and I'm assuming this is the result of the quickly edited action scenes (which were toned down to make the film ""PG-13""), he's not being given the room to really be the best he can be.<br/><br/>As the lead character, he's a transporter. He can get you, your associates or your property anywhere, anytime, on time, no questions asked. But you know what? Common sense tells us that it was curiosity that killed the cat, and the cat in this picture thankfully doesn't die some horrible death but instead, curiosity yields him a break - a beautiful woman named Lai (Shu Qi) - bound and gagged, and in the trunk of his BMW.<br/><br/>It's not spoiling much that she and Frank get together and as a result, are forced to do battle with shady and vicious American businessman Wall Street (Matt Schulze) and his army of high-kicking, disposable assassins. There's a little more to the plot and Lai, and the circumstances surrounding her appearance in the trunk of Frank's car, and it involves some smuggling of poor Chinese immigrants from China to Europe, where much of the action takes place.<br/><br/>Speaking of action and there's plenty of it, Statham does display some pretty impressive moves but the frantic editing just doesn't do him justice. He obviously worked out for this part and there are frequent moments when his ripped torso is on display. He also (barely) manages to shy away any possible accusations that he's just a British novelty to American audiences. Director Corey Yuen (whose work on Jet Li's 2001 action film ""Kiss of the Dragon"" I admired), is behind it and Besson's got a producer credit.<br/><br/>The problem may not be Statham because I think he's a really cool actor with a raspy British accent, but the script is worth some deeper examination by more thoughtful minds. There are plenty of holes and unanswered questions (i.e., the extent of Frank's military training and experiences, Lai and how she wound up with Frank and her quarrelsome relationship with her father who is played by Ric Young, and the plot with the Chinese smuggling).<br/><br/>But why am I making such complaints? ""The Transporter"" is an action movie; no plot required. Despite some bumps in the road, ""The Transporter"" is pure action fun from beginning to end, and I got my free ticket to see ""The Transporter 2"" on Friday.<br/><br/>7/10"
"suspiria10","Null","47","68","21 April 2003"," Smooth Fun!
","Jason Statham plays the Transporter, an ex-military man who will move anything that needs to be moved...no questions asked. He has three simple rules. But when he breaks his cardinal rule, no peeking, he opens a varitable pandora's box that he might not survive. Statham plays one cool character. I could see him as a serious action hero type. The project was spearheaded by Luc (The Professional) Besson and directed by Cory Yuen. The film has high energy and is a load of fun. The fighting scenes are cool and the beginning and ending sequences are a blast. Forget the Fast and the Furious use The Transporter 8/10"
"vitomacdoc","9","34","49","4 September 2006"," Great cult classic for men ....
","The first time I watched this movie, I was hooked, I think it is a sleeper cult classic.<br/><br/>This movie has all the makings of a great testosterone flick. It starts with a wild car chase in France, introduces some memorable phrases, adds an attractive woman and antagonist with a very bad hair piece. There is also the required explosions and fight scenes, but they are not over-the-top.<br/><br/>The plot is not spectacular, but hey, it's a guy movie. Jason Statham makes a great tough guy, loved him in The Italian Job as well.<br/><br/>I recommend inviting your friends over, grabbing some Orangina, and watching this great movie."

","Meet Frank Martin. Martin (Jason Statham) is a retired British Special Forces officer currently enjoying retirement in France. Well, sort of retirement. Frank actually makes his living by transporting goods or people from one location to another. His services have made him a millionaire many times over, evidenced by his oceanview palace. The two-tower structure comes complete with fancy gates, a brick driveway, a garden, two kitchens and even an elevator. In his pristine garage resides the only love of his life, a perfect BMW. His services come with three rules: the deal never changes, no names, and never look in the package.<br/><br/>The movie begins when Martin arrives with perfect punctuality outside of the world's richest bank. He is to whisk three robbers to safety, but four emerge. Citing rule number one, Martin refuses to leave and calmly explains why he cannot carry four men. The lead robber puts a gun to his head, but without the ignition code, he cannot drive. Checkmate. The panicking leader executes the fourth man.<br/><br/>Martin starts the car and is pursued by police in a wild chase through busy streets and narrow alleyways. Dodging and swerving his way to safety, Martin outsmarts the police in the film's high point. This car pursuit has drawn comparisons to a similar scene in The Bourne Identity.<br/><br/>The movie only rests for little while, and then it is on to his next job. His contact explains the job, then says, ""It is for a man named..."" ""No names,"" Martin interrupts, reiterating his strict adherence to the rules. The client's name is Wall Street, I suppose, since he is only addressed with pronouns. The cargo is large bag to be fit in his trunk.<br/><br/>While tending to a flat tire on the way, he notices his ""cargo"" squirming. Curiosity gets the best of him, and he discovers a hopelessly bound girl (Qi Shu) with her mouth sealed shut as well. He has no sympathy and completes the deal, but when his customers double cross him, he enacts revenge and the hostage ends up in his home.<br/><br/>The girl, Lai, is grateful for the help and stays with him though she is free to leave. However, her former captors are not too happy with her current quarters. 5,000 bullets later, she informs Martin that she was smuggled in from China as part of a human slavery operation and many more will follow.<br/><br/>Up until this point, the film is performing admirably, but once it's second half commences, the wheels begin to fall off one by one. The chemistry existing between Statham and Shu in the first act quickly evaporates. Not even the discovery of Martin's conscience works.<br/><br/>We are led to believe that Lai's father (Ric Young) is one of the slaves, but we later find out that he is the mastermind behind the operation. This new discovery throws into question why Lai was in the bag in the first place, and raises many other questions as well. The film never gives its audience the courtesy of answering those questions, and it feels as if Luc Besson is making it up as he goes.<br/><br/>The action also goes down the toilet. It mostly consists of Frank being confronted by a group of ruffians and knocking them to the floor. Each man rises up to fight again, and every time he has them beaten more henchmen appear and join the fray. His reluctance to use lethal force is astounding. The invulnerability of every character completely undermines the effectiveness of everything the film wants to do, and reduces it to the level of Beverly Hills Ninja. The climax involves Frank parachuting onto to a semi-truck in an attempt to commandeer it. It is boring, and reminded me of how much more I enjoyed the semi-truck chase in License to Kill.<br/><br/>Statham flourishes as the amoral Martin and Qi Shu fares well as the confused and vulnerable young girl in strange surroundings. Francois Berleand is satisfactory as a friendly but suspicious detective, but has no interesting material. Matt Schulze falls flat in embarrassing fashion with his lifeless treatment of Wall Street. Ric Young is equally bad. Even Shu, who probably set the record for time being bound on camera, becomes a drone in the second half.<br/><br/>Cory Yuen is better than this. Luc Besson is better than this. Moviegoers deserve more than an action film that slowly destroys itself. The first half warrants a good score, but what follows is so putrid that The Transporter rates only a four out of ten."
"stephen-mooney","7","4","4","29 March 2006"," A Guilty Pleasure
","I first saw this a few years ago, on a rainy day and I nipped into the cinema in the late afternoon to get dry and warm. How glad am i? A film that basically came out of nowhere and helped secure Jason Statham's reputation as being the hardest Englishman in the business (Vinnie Jones? Please!) and one of the most popular actors in America. Its pure adrenaline from the first car case, right through to the homo-erotic but brilliantly choreographed oil fight. Statham's no Tom Hanks in the acting stakes - but then he is not required to be. He's required to look hard as nails and run, jump and punch a lot. Which he does - a lot. The biggest let down of the film was the weak ending. You know that the girl will save his life and kill her father, you know it - but you really don't want it to happen and when it does, well - lets just say that every time i watch the ending I want to throw the TV out the window. Anyway - pure blokes film, great fights, great stunts, cars, guns, sexy woman and it may never win any awards for best screenplay, but that doesn't mean its not worth checking out. And if your girlfriend/boyfriend complains - just mention buffed up men with no shirts on, covered in oil."
"deltajuliet","8","4","4","21 February 2006"," One of my all-time favorites of the Action genre
","Where to start......<br/><br/>The Transporter starts out with a spectacular car chase through Monaco. Statham (this is the first film I saw him in; he's now one of my favorite actors) dazzles the screen as the amazing driver of the BMW right from this opening.<br/><br/>I could talk about character development (and there is some on Frank's, Statham's character's, part), acting (and it was decent), et cetera, but in all honesty, that's not what this film is about. This is about having fun, watching some amazing martial arts, and viewing some great driving. Not to say that it totally relies on action (I absolutely loathe xXx for everything it represents), just that the action scenes are simply the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>And that's why this is one of my favorite action films. The martial arts were some of the best I've seen. Though they may not have been all entirely believable (well, this is an action film), they were always at least possible (versus something like The Matrix). And they were great eye-candy. The martial arts also utilized many things that haven't been in past martial arts flicks (ex: fighting in oil, thus much slipping around, etc). Basically, action = good.<br/><br/>The action direction that Corey Yuen contributes gives John Woo a run for his money. The cinematography seemed to always provide a clean, crisp French Riviera sunshine that gave a vibe of energy and excitement (and aesthetic appeal). Fight scenes were never hard to follow, and always fun to watch. Car chases were beautiful. I don't know if I've said it yet, but this is a great action film! It's never too over-the-top, and it's not totally non-stop action, so the action that is provided is boosted that much more. A must-see for action-buffs, Statham fans, or Shi Qu fans, this is one of the most recent cult films I know of."

","I am usually apprehensive about seeing films with relatively unknown faces,because either they are shoddily directed,or woefully low-budget affairs that are quickly forgotten.This movie however proved me wrong completely.Jason Statham plays a retired military man who makes a living by transporting goods in France,and no questions asked about their particulars.Things are hunky-dory until he finds that he is transporting a young Chinese girl in his car,who happens to be the daughter of a crime-lord,illegally bringing in immigrants from Asia.What's more,she is bent on stopping her father and this makes both of them targets of the organization.The film is extremely well made,and the action sequences are deftly handled by Cory Yuen.Jason Statham has the makings of a good action hero in him , and I wouldn't mind seeing more of him.Newcomer Shu Qi is pretty articulate ,but in the end it is the fast-paced action that makes this film a product worth trying,as none of the characters save Statham leaves any impression on the viewer.Pure unadulterated action for a Saturday night."

"dreadfulape","2","15","23","14 May 2007"," A truly repulsive and ridiculous movie
","This is one of the stupidest movies ever made. Not just in terms of the logic of its plot. That would be OK. But it is also outrageous in its grotesque representation of the female lead and jarring in its mismatch of derivative elements - fight scenes, car chases and petty sadism.<br/><br/>The car chases are a fair attempt to match the standard of ""Ronin"". The fight scenes are uniquely detailed attempts to copy the style and energy of Jackie Chan. But the former film is a proper hard-bitten thriller where sinister people on both sides are fighting for high stakes. When cars are driven down public streets, innocent members of the public get hurt. 'Transporter' crosses over into Blues Brothers territory (such as the car leaping into the air from a standing start and landing on the lorry). And yet other elements of the film are deeply nasty (such as the bank robbers assassinating their own members).<br/><br/>Likewise the 'comedy' fighting: Jackie Chan movies work because they know that they are simple fun. This attempts the same thing in a ill-fitting version of a 'hard-bitten' thriller, and ends with sheer nonsense. After the endless fight on the bus and in the station (one man in unarmed combat versus dozens), there is then the ridiculous fight in the oil-covered room, with its absurd bicycle pedal denouement. The hero then returns to the bus station and takes a gun from an injured man. If the injured man had a gun, why didn't he use it? Throughout the movie, the baddies have guns, and use them: except when the scriptwriter decides to fit in some Jackie Chan action.<br/><br/>The 'hero' in this movie is in fact an extremely unpleasant individual. He is quite prepared to deliver The Girl into slavery or whatever fate awaits her. He rejects a number of chances to help her (even after he has discovered the only important thing about the character, that she is (ho-hum) exceptionally attractive). OK - that's the stereotypical anti-hero. But why does she then turn to him for help, help him, cook for him, and fall for him sexually and emotionally? There is no reason whatsoever for her to do this. He should be her enemy quite as much as the 'baddies'. And yet she does. It is an utterly unashamedly misogynist and racist depiction of the ""submissive Asian girl"", and of the ""hot chick"" role of females in a action movies generally."
"Maciste_Brother","2","8","11","26 November 2003"," I liked it better when it was called LICENCE TO KILL!
","THE TRANSPORTER is a schintzy action movie with nothing notable about it except for two things: first, its non-acting star, Jason Statham, who, even though he seems to have the right moves to become the next Jean Claude, looks more like a concentration camp survivor than anything else. And second, the ending, which, remarkably, is an almost scene by scene copy of the ending in the James Bond flick, LICENCE TO KILL. I mean, there are homages and then there are ripoffs, and the ending in THE TRANSPORTER is a total ripoff of the ending in the 007 movie. It's unreal. I'm surprised Brocoli corp & MGM/UA didn't sue. <br/><br/>During the climax, in both films, there are two trucks transporting illegal goods, with the villains in two cars driving behind the trucks. In both films, the hero flies over the moving vehicles in a crop-duster and lands on one of the trucks. In both films, the hero battles with the driver of one of the trucks and gains control of it. In both films, the cars try to shoot the hero by driving next to the trucks. In both films, the hero ends up underneath the truck and his shot at by the villain in the cars with machine guns, etc. There's no need to go on. The whole thing is ridiculously similar. The scenery even looks similar in both films.<br/><br/>Except for a couple of ok fighting scenes, THE TRANSPORTER was an almost complete waste of time."
"pfgpowell-1","Null","4","5","19 November 2011"," Hamlet it ain't but of its - very limited kind - better than many
","Films such as Transporter (and, I should imagine, Transporter 2 and Transporter 3 unless there has been a dramatic change of heart by their producers) highlight one of the dilemmas of IMDBs user ratings system. All the films I come across here have, without exception, been given the 8/10 and 9/10 ratings which only the truly devoted award. And each of of those films has also earned the very pitiful 1/10 and 2/10 ratings.<br/><br/>On the one hand, praise such as 'awesome, dude, truly awesome' and 'real genius, dude, this is the real sh*t' are bandied about like beer at a truckers convention, on the other those same films get also '90 minutes out of my life I'll NEVER get back!!!', 'this SUCKED big time, man!!!' and 'this would get 0/10 if the system allowed it' from other, less enchanted viewers. All that is only to be expected and - cliché alert - wouldn't the world be a duller place if we all thought the same. But what do you do when you see a well-made, entertaining piece of complete schlock which stands head and shoulders about its peer films and then a well-made, very moving and thoughtful film which is unlike the schlock as cheese is to chalk? In all honesty there can be no comparison, yet both deserve a high rating.<br/><br/>Of its kind, Transporter does stand out. But it does so without characterisations and plot entirely. What vague storyline there is simply the help the hero, in this case Jason Statham, roar from one fight to the next. In in Transporter's case it works. Why, I have no idea. Certainly, the producers hired good talent, not least Luc Besson who has latterly made this kind of film his stock in trade. A great deal about this film boasts 'class', except, it has to be said, the film itself. But the point is it doesn't matter. You don't go to your neighbourhood hamburger joint and expect haut cuisine and you would be thought of as dim-witted if you then criticised the joint for not reaching haut cuisine standards.<br/><br/>So those who like this kind of thing, the Transporter movie will get their money's worth and then some. And it would be futile, not to say ineffably silly, to criticise Transporter for being utterly and ludicrously over the top. Because, of course, it is meant to be utterly and ludicrously over the top. It succeeds and stands out for several reasons. One is Jason Statham, the Transporter. I like Jason. I have now seen him in three films and I'm on his side. If Jason gets through his day job by not taking it seriously, he doesn't show it. But nor does he give the impression of believing himself to be 'an artist'. He has a certain quality about him which, if not unique, is rare. He knows what he can do and, presumably, what he can't do, and doesn't pretend. With Jason you feel what you see is what you get. And I like that. I could, of course, be completely wrong, but somehow I don't think so, and it is that certain honesty which comes across on camera and helps to raise what is at heart pretty mediocre material rather higher. Jason gives value for money. If Jason flipped hamburgers, you could be pretty sure they would be stand-out, top-dollar hamburgers. And it is that quality which carries the film as far as I am concerned.<br/><br/>In another's hands the role he takes would go bear-shaped quite soon (although that is not to say there aren't other men about with the same quality as Jason. There are other 'hard men' out their - Vin Diesel and Steven Seagal, although I haven't seen a film by either - but I doubt whether any of the others would carry it off as Jason does. So there you have it: Transporter is not The Merchant Of Venice, On Golden Pond, ET, Schindler's List, The Godfather or any of the other films which get consistently good ratings. It is just another macho piece of b******s. The important difference is that, of its kind, it is rather more impressive (in that way rather like anther Luc Besson scripted film, District 13). Hence my high rating."

","A hard-boiled ex-soldier (Jason Statham) runs a private 'transporting' business in which he moves goods for clients from point A to point B, no questions asked, no packages opened and no names exchanged. One day, he breaks his own rule by opening the large bag he is transporting and finds a beautiful gagged woman (Qi Shu) in it.<br/><br/>Jason Statham of Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels fame slips into the buff testosterone-fuelled action-hero role with almost effortless conviction and the perfection with which he delivers his cheesy lines deserves credit (""All right, that's enough juice for now.""). From the campy winks, the fast-paced drop-kicks and packing punches and just generally badass attitude, Statham clearly masters the B-action genre. He knows what he needs to do to entertain the audience, and he does it like he means business. Hardcore, in other words.<br/><br/>However his ""American"" accent clearly deserves less credit. If you were BLOWN AWAY by Kevin Costner in Prince of Thieves or Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta, you will like his efforts. Ditto Qi Shu whose performance keeps us guessing (mostly about what the hell she is saying). In all fairness, I thought she was really cute as Lai  the woman who complicates things by popping up from the bag, but also viciously annoying with her little high-pitched girly screams and submissive approach. Thankfully, Statham and Shu's on-screen chemistry makes up for this and facilitates the whole plot on an important, fundamental level. Because they are so different (macho-man vs. girly girl), they somehow look great juxtaposed.<br/><br/>This plot never strays from its template story. Ever. It's simple. It's straightforward. It's action-packed and amazingly fast-paced. Twenty minutes fly past like five. But enough praise, because ""The Transporter"" really isn't a good movie. Even if you're looking for cheap adrenaline kicks this would not be the first film I'd recommend (it's probably be Poseidon [2006], ha) -- this simply lacks 'oomph' and the good guys are too GOOD and the bad guys are too BAD. Nothing new -- next, please!<br/><br/>6/10"

","Transporter (Jason Strathan) is hired to deliver a package for a mobster, but throws one of his own rules out the window by looking in the package and discovering a bound and gagged young woman (Qi Shu), which puts his life in great danger. I have such mixed feelings about this movie. Some of the acting by the supporting actors is rather bad on the other hand though, Jason Strathan has a very natural and commanding presence on screen and makes an interesting choice for an action hero. Qi Shu has a very thick accent and her English isn't very good, but she delivers a very impassioned (and probably better then this film deserves) performance. The cinematography is striking and the direction things moving along nicely. The action scenes are excellent."

","NO SPOILERS BECAUSE YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THIS<br/><br/>Caught this on cable recently, and I have to say avoid it all costs.  I think it is probably one of the worst films I have seen in quite sometime, though I am guessing Transporter 2 might surpass that.<br/><br/>
Lots of rapid-fire editing (think Robert Rodriguez on PCP) cannot cover up how lame and ridiculous the car chases---he is THE Transporter after all---are.  The actual fight scenes, as mentioned by other reviewers, are also hilariously bad as well.<br/><br/>Even worse, though, is the story, or lack of one.  As likeable as Statham is in Guy Ritchie films, he is given nothing but horrible dialogue and no plot to work with here.  This should not be surprising, considering Luc Besson wrote and produced this.

","It's been a little while since I've seen this movie, but I can not bring myself to watch this ""movie"" ever again. When I went to see this movie, I was expecting a nice Ronin-esque like action flick. Especially considering I'm a huge fan of Jason Statham, and all the previous movies he has done. Instead I've got a poorly thrown together clichés and scenes with absolutely no point. The lead female character barely speaks English (they TRY to explain this fact in the movie), and needs to spend much more time in acting school. That probably goes for at least half of the actors in the film. The soundtrack is horrific. The music in and of itself is great, however it seems as in the sounds somehow were mixed up and the wrong music was played at the wrong scene. There are times where techno is playing during a slow scene, and a nice slow song plays during an action sequence. The dialogue is forced, the story is cliché, and nothing whatsoever stands out from this movie to write about. The only decent scene was the car chase at the beginning of the movie and the fight scene between Jason and the many villains in the warehouse. It did manage to show off Jason's potential as an action hero, as well as had some creative fighting moves. However, this movie has nothing to offer. The same action can be seen in different, and much better films. Avoid this as you would the Black Plague.<br/><br/>1 out of 10"

","I can't say it any other way; The Transporter is a steaming pile of celluloid ****. I watched it once and hated it. I only watched it again because other people saw some value in it, so I figured I must've missed something. It turns out, I'm not the problem here at all. It's the film that is lacking.<br/><br/>The action is pretty much the same stuff you've seen in countless Jet Li movies, only crappy. The Car chases were forgettable. The only sequence that stands out is the Raiders of the Lost Ark rip-off. Statham is not a martial artist, and even an untrained eye can see that in the ho-hum choreography. From the martial arts angle, this movie would do well to come up short. Hell, the only way it could be seen as impressive or exciting is if you had never seen another martial arts sequence. That, or you've only seen American martial arts films from the 80's...<br/><br/>The plot....is nonexistent. There are so many plot holes that is should be considered disgusting, but so many people make excuses for crap like this. *sigh* And stunt performers wonder why they don't get the respect they deserve...Bare in mind, by applauding mediocre crap like this (just as an example), YOU DON'T HELP!!!!! For crying out loud, the central twist in the plot (if you can call it that) has no justification. Why was Lai in the duffel bag? It's never clear to the viewer, and no explanation makes sense. There's nothing she could do to effect the situation besides bitch about it, and frankly any other rationalization would be drawing at straws. If you've got one, I'd like to hear it. However, every explanation I've heard so far has been a complete load of crap. So wow me. While you're at it, tell me why Frank went against his own rules to help a person that he couldn't have known was in the bag in the first place. All he saw was the bag moving, no sounds of any kind. For all he knew, that was a bag of rabid squirrels. I know the movie needed an excuse to get the ball rolling, but don't insult us...<br/><br/>Aside from other ridiculous points in the films (like the convenient open space on the truck at the beginning of the movie), look out for the first squabble Frank and ""Wall Street"" have. After Frank is knocked to the ground, the stock villain ""Wall Street"" says to his henchmen; ""Keep him alive..."" The only sensible question to ask at this point is ""For WHAT?!!?!?!?"" Skip this unless you hate yourself..."

In all, this movie feels like a 6th-grade book report."

","The Transporter takes everything that's bad about action movies and combines them into possibly the worst 90 minutes of film I have ever seen.  This film is a complete joke and insults the intelligence of anyone who watches it.<br/><br/>
I saw the misleading trailer and thought that it might actually be worth watching, but how wrong I was.  There are so many things wrong with this film that it's difficult to know where to start.  Just how dumb can a film actually be?  The following situations in the film just defy belief: **Contains Spoilers!**<br/><br/>1) The breathing apparatus conveniently stored in the water under Franks house!<br/><br/>2) Frank chasing a light aircraft - on foot - and catching up with it!<br/><br/>3) The truck steering and accelerating all on it's own while Frank is fighting the bad guy inside it!<br/><br/>4) The bad guy conveniently having a time bomb in a suitcase handy to give to Frank when he drops of the package!<br/><br/>5) The bad guys getting to the bus station so quick!<br/><br/>
Don't get me wrong; I love a nice, well-made, brainless action flick as much as the next guy, but The Transporter is so pathetic, so ridiculous and just so plain DUMB that I actually felt insulted after I watched it. Also:<br/><br/>6) Jason Statham's accent! - What the hell is going on there??<br/><br/>7) The music! - Could they have actually chosen worse music for this film?? It annoys the hell out of you and does not fit the on-screen action at all. The song played over the end credits is absolutely hilarious (unintentionally, of course) - just have a listen to the lyrics and you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>
As a comedy, this is about as good as it gets!  The ludicrous scenes described above, coupled with terrible accents and an even worse plot, means you'll be laughing out loud most of the way through - I know I was. However, as an action movie this is definitely one to avoid. like the plague!"

Jason is the ""Transporter"" and ex military guy living in France who delivers stuff for 'dubious clientele' so long as they follow his rules. However, the transporter screws up by breaking the rules by opening a package and getting involved when he ends up transporting a Chinese woman to someone.<br/><br/>At this point you want to know where the story is suppose to go, but what really happens is it goes nowhere.  Sure it's an action film, with a great car chase and some great unique fight sequences.  But at some point the people making this tried to make the story solve itself within 5 minutes in an office room as they start introducing more bad guys, and try to write up a hasty conclusion.<br/><br/>From this point on you can't even like the film for its stupidness.  It doesn't even get to maintain some degree of B movie camp.  Worse is that the acting when needed particualry between Straham and You Qi is so chessy and SOOOOOOOO bad it is cringe inducing to listen to.  Like the great French setting this movie reaked of over ripe camembert.<br/><br/>It's too bad cause Stratham is definitly passible as an action hero, and the oil slick fight scene is quite ingenious.  But the HORRIBLY bad acting, horrible dramatic moments, and lack of any comedic fun make this film DEATHLY DULL.  There are also some unbelievable continuity errors the most obvious being that one of the rules for the transporter is that nobody knows his name, but 1/2 way through the film at one point, You Qi is calling him Frank for no reason or explanation.

","AWWW!!!!!!! What a bad movie. I hate when I have no fair no choice in what I me and my friends watch at the cinema because they gang up on my choice anyway...... This was straight out bad.  BAD actors and performances all round. Jason Statham is great in Snatch but in this movie he sucks big time. No redeeming aspects at all. Except the fight where he ""THE TRANSPORTER"" tips the oil and everyone slips all over the place trying to grab him. I didn't even like the action scenes they were so generic. Corey Yuen what were you thinking. I love his old stuff my personal fave is My Father Is a Hero. But he screwed up big time here. Also Luc Besson who I am fan of his work, this a dodgy movie with typical structure and plot more thin than a super-model with a eating disorder. And the chase scenes weren't even exciting. I most more thrilled by riding a coin operated pony ride. The whole movie was predictable and was so boring when the actors spoke pointless dialogue which got in the way of the barrage of fight scenes. And the romantic interest couldn't even speak English properly, when she tries to say ""Or your brain goes on the f**king desk!"" she could barley pronounce it. At least they just slip in the pointless sex quickly without reason. Just have the girl slip off her gear and jump the b*****d, Also the French cop sucked. His worst line in the movie was in response to the Frank saying ""Well I'm ex-navy..."" and he says"" Well I'm ex-little boy..."", Great dialogue time went into that one. And the worst part of the movie is when Frank is in jail and the cop unlocks the cell and then hints to Frank that he should escape and save the day. After ""hinting"" it they exchange pointless looks for about 3 mins, the French cop trying to get the message across. In final I hated this movie is was short and was an anti climax.

Once you find out what the movies all about it kind of ruins the cool tone it had to it originally. The plot itself is not only bad, but is thrown together, making for a really patchy film. The action is great - but that's all. Even at some points its absolutely ridiculous what is pulled off. I found myself laughing at a few parts. And those weren't the parts I was supposed to be laughing at.<br/><br/>Transporter tries to be funny at parts, and it really isn't. It tries to be serious throughout, when really it's just weird. I wouldn't recommend this movie even as an action flick, since most of the action is repetitive and unrealistic. For example, two cars collide and burst into flames before they barely even hit each other. But what bothered me most about this film is the extremely poor music selection. What was left of the Transporter that made it any bit redeeming was ruined by the awful soundtrack. Half of it was hip-hop, when there really shouldn't have even been music. And the score for the rest of the film simply isn't that good and doesn't fit the tone of the movie. All in all it was another disappointing movie rental. I could keep the flick for another week but I returned it the day after. I didn't really want to look at it. This kind of makes me not want to see Transporter 2, but I will still give it a chance."

The voice over throughout only adds to your involvement with his character and sympathy to his plight.<br/><br/>Here however I felt that Statham was totally misdirected. He seemed straight jacketed in the part and the lines he was given further tied him down. His screen presence is fantastic and the film on paper should have been great. The opening car chase (although ridden with more continuity errors than many entire films) was reminiscent of Frankenheimer, even more so with the French location. The story however as it unfolded I felt was staggered and unconvincing both in content and acting. The Asian girl I thought was about as wooden as an 18th century Galleon and although there should not have been any chemistry due to the circumstances, any attempt just didn't work, including the scene where she drops her clothes in the doorway. Totally embarrassing, dialogue, acting, direction...todo! There were many simply unbelievable parts and I can't help nut think that this should have been an 18 so that the makers could have exploited the violence and gun play to it's max which seemed to be it's mainstay anyway. Insteadwith a kiddie rating which I feel could have been executed so much better. Once I saw the rocket leave the launcher when Stathams house was attacked, and travel almost pedestrian like through his kitchen, giving them both time to take evasive action, my suspension of belief snapped and I had to enter the comedy zone for the rest of the film. All the time fighting my better intentions because the film had great production values, even if it did contain a tad too many jump cuts for my liking. It dipped in and out of great and mediocre for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>Statham earned a nice pay packet no doubt, but I'm sure he'll look back on this as a huge turkey that probably didn't warrant a sequel, of which I have not seen. Hopefully he'll not try and any more accents, god knows why this either wasn't dubbed or scrubbed from day 1 of the shoot. It would have worked better with his native accent, possibly tidied up for the US market who seem to have a problem with the 'mockney' south London drawl. There were so many dialects and accents it was a bit of a mess on that front.<br/><br/>This surely has to win the prize for most bullets dodged by leading man in any film to date.<br/><br/>Watch Ronin and see where it could have gone."

Despite this he completes the job and picks up another package from his customer, Wall Street.  On a break from driving his `package' then explodes.  He returns to his client and steals a car, unwittingly taking the girl with him.  Martin then finds himself the target of this gang and is put in a position where he must do the right thing.<br/><br/>I'm not really a big action fan and the last few things I watched were disappointing, not living up to the hype.  XXX was a major let down for me. However the Transporter seemed to offer low-key action without a big Hollywood marketing campaign behind it.  First of all let me deal with the plot  it is nonsense from start to finish!  The film sets up Martin as a real pro in the exciting opening scene  but then expects us to accept that he opens the package and lets the girl escape scenes later, it just doesn't wash for me.  The rest of the plot sort of falls into place heavily and, when it needs to explain things, feels very slow and ponderous  it's better if you don't think about it.<br/><br/>Despite the weak plot the film is very enjoyable simply because of the great action scenes.  They are a mix of well choreographed fights and OTT action. The OTT action is a little much but is enjoyable none the less (and doesn't look that OTT beside the excesses of XXX).  The fight scenes are very cool and Statham is very physical, doing some very cool moves.  It's these martial arts scenes that really make the film.  The soundtrack is pumping hip-hop.  It isn't great music but the pumping nature of the music fits well with the onscreen action most of the time.<br/><br/>Statham is really good and is much tougher than Vin Diesel was.  Physically he is very impressive and he can really move when he wants to.  His cool, professional look is really good and had me hooked from the first scene.  Qi Shu is OK in the support and is quite playful, while Schulze is a standard bad guy.<br/><br/>Overall this is the perfect film for a Saturday night.  It isn't great, the plot is weak and the ending is a little bit of an anti-climax with it's happy sunny ending, but the action is good and, more than some over hyped films, it is actually FUN to watch it  just don't expect all the bits to be good."

","This action packed story is written by Luc Besson and directed by Louis Leterrier and is exactly as Besson envisioned it. Jason Statham plays an ex-Special Forces soldier named Frank Martin. Living quietly in a secluded, and isolated house on the Mediterran. Frank was hoping he could retire without conflict. Unfortunately, his unusual private practice of hiring out as a special delivery man, puts that dream in jeopardy. The Movie is called "" The Transporter "" and relates Frank's story of being able to deliver anything from point one to point two, providing his simple rules concerning his employment and his safety are not violated. Such is the tale until a man code name "" Wall Street "" (Matt Schulze) requires Frank to deliver a certain 'special' package (Qi Shu) without question. His personal rules violated, Frank becomes involved in more that just a delivery. When the heavies decide to reciprocate with violence, Frank is introduced to Inspector Tarconi (François Berléand) who believes that Frank is certainly a 'Person of Interest.' The rest of the movie becomes a fun filled adventure of high flying street chases, explosions and physical action involving Martial arts of the best kind. The result becomes the basis or foundation for future films in like manner or a series as I certainly would be interested in seeing more. Jason Statham is certainly the right actor for this movie, one that you certainly want to see more of. Excellent film and readily recommended. ****"

Jason Statham is every bit as good as the various Bond actors and, dare I suggest it, if his character had been named James Bond, this movie would be rated every bit as good as all those 007 movies. The action is unbelievable (let's face it, NO ONE could do what Frank (or JB) does but that doesn't matter. The film is made to entertain and that's what it does.

All of Jason Statham's fighting couldn't bail this movie out in my opinion.<br/><br/>I know that Hollywood likes to use pure mind-numbing shooting and fighting to hide its weak scripts, but nothing doing this time. It all went south when the damsel in distress (Lai) decided that this stranger (Frank) was good enough and safe enough to remain with.

The sudden and alarmingly abrupt change of style and pace of the film almost makes me question if there were original filmmakers (obviously harden vets of the action movie genre, who's craft has been molded and fine tune through years and years) who were fired halfway through production and replaced with some random crew members pot head teenage son and his bong hitting cronies. The movie is a plunge into stupidity in every way fathomable,  with some of the worst written dialogue ever to be penned. Such is the case when the evil villain of the story is killed, only to have his hostage daughter pipe up in big, teary, dough eyes `He was a bastard.but he was still my father.'<br/><br/>The film picks up for a brief, shining moment about two thirds into it with a extremely well filmed and choreographed fight scene that has the hired-driver-hero fighting off thugs as he's drenched in oil or some other brown liquid.

","By John Ulmer<br/><br/>Many action films are surprise hits. No one ever expected ""Die Hard"" to be as big as it was. No one even believed that ""The Terminator"" would cram itself into American culture so willingly. If you have noticed, or whether you have not, most excellent ""surprise hit"" action films are the humble type, or low budget action flicks that suddenly become box office hits, then spawn sequels that sometimes are as good, but most of the time are not.<br/><br/> And then there are the films that try to be ""the next big hit,"" and do not become a hit at all. ""The Transporter"" is a good example of this. The film obviously wanted to become the next ""Die Hard,"" but it was not. It turned out to be a disappointing action ride filled with all testosterone and no brains. And unlike ""xXx,"" ""The Transporter"" was not even dumb fun. It was no fun.<br/><br/> Frank is your average military hero-turned-criminal. His job involves a Mercedes, a set of rules, and transporting criminals or packages from place to place. This all changes when Frank disobeys his own rules and becomes involved with the package he is transporting - a Chinese woman named Li, or Liu, or something like that. Anyway, the average plot involves Frank getting romantically involved and taking on the baddies.<br/><br/> When the movie first started I thought ""Wow, this is great!"" But soon, after the nice car chase, the film goes downhill and never gains enough momentum to climb back up the hill. The ending is definitely adrenaline-pumped, but not really fun, or smart. I didn't expect something real intelligent, but something a bit fun would have been nice.<br/><br/>A laudable effort, but no cigar.<br/><br/>""The Transporter"" stars Jason ""Snatch"" Stratham and a few no-names.<br/><br/>2/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"
"Liquid-5","2","2","3","19 October 2002"," This movie is total garbage
","Few films bring to mind gold standard by which all bad movies are measured. The gold standard? Dante's Peak, of course. That film demonstrated a total lack or respect for the viewer, not only offending through a total swiss cheese plot, but also by blowing all sense of reality through the window. The Transporter is in this category of poor films. The first 15 minutes actually lulled me into a false sense of happy expectation. Yes, it was ripped off of Ronin, but a good car chase is still a good car chase.<br/><br/>Once the car chase stopped, though, the crap began. I think that there was a plot somewhere in the movie, but I can't be entirely sure since they dropped what felt like plot elements in every 20 minutes or so and never really explained them. I doubt it was a very good plot anyway, you don't hide plots that are sound between useless action sequences. That's ok, though, it's hard to care about a plot when you can't find anyone in the film to sympathize with. The Transoporter was a hollow and emotionless character, first not really caring about the woman in the trunk and suddenly lusting for her, after several times declaring she is nothing but problematic. Oh, yeah, I can see why he's ex-military since he puts a loose rope around her neck and lets her go out of sight to pee. Hey, guess what, not exactly razor sharp military intelligence there, pal.<br/><br/>Then there's Chinese girl. She's a whore, and not exactly sure where her allegiances lie. At one point, she could saver the Transporter from a problematuic situation, but chooses instead to just look dumb. She jumps into bed with the Transporter ten minutes after meeting him, and doesn't exactly have a very clear picture of how she sees her father. Anyhow, it might actually be worth seeing this at some point. I have no doubt it will make every movie you've ever thought was bad seem that much better, as this is truly a Batman & Robin level piece of trash."

If you can ignore the fact that in the opening minutes, Martin is stopped right next to some police officers who see him in his car and then he goes through a very elaborate car chase scene, but still no one can identify him.  If you can ignore the fact that he breaks his rules of opening the package for no good reason, but rescues the girl, and she is a subservient non-entity, who uses sex (""What we did last night was real"") for her own reasons.

Three things to do with a PhD:
a) use it for self-improvement;
b) use it for the betterment of mankind; or
c) say ""bollocks"" to it all and write a bunch of action movies.<br/><br/>Tough choice, but if you're Robert Mark Kamen, co-screenwriter of The Transporter and proud owner of a PhD in Anthropology, it's gotta be c).<br/><br/>Kamen's got a nice line in churning out cheap, cheerful, chop-socky movies (first Kiss Of The Dragon, now this) along with writer-producer Luc Besson. And don't get us wrong - we're grateful. Even if it's pretty evident after ten minutes that PhD stands for ""pretty hokey dialogue"". Or is that ""plot hardly discernible""?<br/><br/>No matter. The Transporter exists purely to turn our very own Jason Statham into an action star capable of putting the willies up Vin Diesel. It succeeds admirably.<br/><br/>Post-Ghosts Of Mars, if anyone had suggested that big, bald, brusque Jase could hold his own as an action hero, they'd have been laughed out of town. And while he doesn't exactly deliver an acting masterclass (his 'American' accent doesn't quite stand up to the rigours of actually opening his mouth and talking), this is all about kicking ass and taking names.<br/><br/>And the model-turned-actor is impressive enough - athletic, powerful and displaying hitherto unseen martial arts prowess - to deserve a crack at bigger things.<br/><br/>Here, though, his character starts out with an intriguing amorality, but quickly becomes Mr. Bog Standard Action Guy, taking on hordes of villains armed at times merely with a sweater and, in one hilarious scene, an oil slick and bike pedals.<br/><br/>If all that improvisational guff sounds very Jackie Chan, that's deliberate. The spirit of Hong Kong action movies hangs heavily over The Transporter, most notably in the CG-free fight scenes which, thanks to former fight choreographer Yuen, have enough zing and originality to satisfy even Hong Kong aficionados. Helpfully, they also take your mind off the nonsense in between, complete with dreadful dialogue from Robert Mark Kamen.<br/><br/>He has a PhD, you know.<br/><br/>Statham impresses in a movie that is simultaneously the best (the fight scenes) and worst (everything else) action movie of the year.

The Transporter, however, sees all three on top form, their film providing an hour-and-a-half of exhilarating, knowingly dumb comic-book nonsense, star Statham playing his part perfectly, with an admirable sense of seriousness despite the patent silliness of the action (unlike his irritatingly OTT performances in the Crank films).<br/><br/>As the story progresses, the gunfights, fist fights and explosions get bigger and better, with logic never allowed to get in the way of spectacle. Statham looks every inch the action hero and handles his martial arts scenes convincingly, the best being a hugely enjoyable battle against numerous foes that makes use of a couple of barrels of grease and a pair of bicycle pedals.

","The Transporter movies all share the same basic elements. Fantastic action scenes, barely-there stories, and Jason Statham. In the original Transporter, we're introduced to Frank, Statham's character, and the absolute bare minimum of his background. The rest of the movie is car chases, explosions, and fights.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot, because it's pretty much only here to give Statham a pretext to hand out his butt-kickings. My favorite thing about these movies is that Statham is never really in danger of dying or being beaten. If he's fighting someone, they MAY get in a hit or two before puts them down. Even if it's like, 20 guys with machine guns, and all he has for a weapon is his shirt. The fight scenes are pretty cool, you can always rely on this series to add a few new wrinkles to the standard old sequences.<br/><br/>There's some kind of smuggling going on that Qi Shu's dad is involved in, and Matt Shulze is somehow involved in it too. And François Berléand plays some kind of cop who is also Jason's friend, or something. Qi is the eye candy/damsel in distress/love interest, Francois helps move the plot along, and the rest of the cast are bad guys. That's pretty much it. Seriously.<br/><br/>Don't watch The Transporter if you're looking for a well-written script or some compelling character development.

","Back in the 1990s Luc Besson was a top action director in the US and France, best known for films like Leon and Nikita. In the early part of the 21st Century, he turned to producing and one of his major hits was The Transporter, the film that made Jason Statham into an action star.<br/><br/>Frank Martin (Statham) is an ex-military man who turned into a driver for hire in the South of France. He lives by three rules: No.1 never change the deal, No.2 no names, No.3 never open the package. But on a job he opens the package to find a Chinese woman (Shu Qi) tied up and gag, resulting with him crossing an American gangster, Bettencourt (Matt Schulze) who wants Frank dead. Frank has to work with the woman, Lai, and a police detective, Inspector Tarconi (François Berléand), to bring down Bettencourt and his operator.<br/><br/>The Transporter takes a basic B-Movie plot and story and gives it an MTV flash. The highlight of the film is action sequences which director Corey Yuen injected a load of fun elements with martial arts, gun battles, an axe fight and the famous oil fight scene. There are flashy moments like when a gun is in the air and the downwards camera on a gun when a machine gun magazine clip drops to the ground. There is some weak CGI but it is rare and the best parts of the action is the practical effects and stunt work. The real problem with the action is at times there was too much quick cutting which made some of the action sequence and it made them hard to follow: this was the particularly the case with the fight in the bus which was too tight, too close and overly edited. The best sequence for me was the highway chase because it was easier to tell what was happening and for the most part the fighting and gun fights were well done.<br/><br/>The Transporter was Statham's first leading role outside of Guy Ritchie's films. He had the action chops with his physique and his martial arts ability and he was already showing his shy wit. But he gave his character a weak American accent which kept slipping. Likely Statham had enough charisma and was able to give Frank enough menace in his look. Statham also had very good chemistry with Qi who did have charm as Lai. The pair worked well and were surprisingly believable in the context of their world.<br/><br/>The Transporter lacked a threaten villain: Schulze played his role more as a man who is partier then a ruthless crime lord who will kill anyone who crosses him. Schulze's performance also did not help giving the character smug, frat boy characteristics. The film also introduces a character called Leon who was able to beat up and knock out Frank, leading you to think that there is going to be a showdown between the characters: but it never comes about, which is very disappointing.<br/><br/>Stanley Clarke gave The Transporter a more modern, techno score which was fitting for the most part, especially when it becomes pumping for the action sequences near the end. The score combined by the French setting reminded me a little bit of The Bourne Identity. But The Bourne Identity is a much more intelligentially stimulating film.<br/><br/>The Transporter is a very paced actioner that does not rest. There are fine action sequences throughout the film and a decent start to The Stath's action persona: but this is a film for Statham fans."

And surprisingly, it is.<br/><br/>I'm not going to lie, I enjoyed this film when it first came out, and even more so today because of the monotonous sequels that follow a similar formula, and never take risks with the character.<br/><br/>The plot involves Frank doing a transporting job for a criminal, and just when the mission seems like a success, suspicions begin to unravel and Frank is thrown into a firefight with the criminal in question, while attempting to protect a woman he was never meant to see due to his strict rules. <br/><br/>The film follows a simple execution with enough turns to keep you entertained, but only to a certain degree. The fight scenes are slick, as are the driving scenes. The only kind of scene it's missing is a good old shootout, as we learn quickly that Frank fights mainly with his fists, which is fine, but it doesn't leave a lot of imagination to the viewer for what would happen next. <br/><br/>The acting is sub-par. I like to consider Jason Statham a good actor when he wants to be, and he's good in this movie, but every one else seems to follow a generic formula, and it just falls short.<br/><br/>I give the Transporter a 6/10 because even though it may be hooky in some parts, the action is good and it serves nicely as a movie to watch when feeling like nothing more than an action flick.

It stars Jason Statham, Shu Qi, Matt Schulze & François Berléand. Music is by Stanley Clarke and cinematography comes courtesy of Pierre Morel. Plot sees Statham as ex-soldier Frank Martin, a much respected courier in the underworld who is dynamite behind the wheel of a car and electric with his fists and feet. Living it up nice and cushy on the French Riviera, he lives by a set of rules that should not be broken, but during this particular ""transport"" job, he breaks his rules out of curiosity and gets embroiled in a fight for life.<br/><br/>The Transporter made back double its production budget, enough of a financial swing to ensure that sequels would follow (two so far, with the first sequel easily the best of the three). With Stallone et al on the wane, and the likes of Diesel and The Rock yet to convince, The Transporter gave ex-model-turned actor-Statham the chance to flex his muscles and make a mark in the action genre. Which he did, with great physicality, deft of movement and rugged good looks. Which is just as well since all those around him are rather bad. He's helped enormously by the choreography of Yuen, who gives the fight scenes plenty of zest and originality to leave them memorable. The spirit of Hong Kong action movies reigns supreme in The Transporter, with the added bonus being that of Morel's pleasing photography. But strip away the action and there's nothing left, the plot is boorish and the dialogue just dreadful, worse still is Clarke's music score, where instead of adrenalin boosting urgency we get leaden comedy. Very poor, and indicative of the production. It seems that the makers had themselves a bunch of great action set pieces to begin with, and then built the film around them, without due care and attention.<br/><br/>It does what is expected of it as an action piece of popcorn, but it's pretty shallow outside of that. 6.5/10"

Displeased about this he returns to the house he'd dropped the woman at and helps himself to one of the cars there; but not before beating up a load of goons. As he drives away he discovers that the Chinese woman, called Lai, had escaped in the commotion and hidden in the car. The man who wanted him dead wasn't in the house at the time and when he learns what has happened heads off to kill Frank... Frank is hard to kill though and he is soon helping Lai who explains that the man is involved in human trafficking. Soon she has been captured by the man and we learn that her father is also involved with the trafficking. Frank spends the remainder of the film fighting hoards of goons, parachuting onto the back of a moving lorry and dodging bullets while trying to rescue Lai and the trafficked people who are trapped in a container.<br/><br/>If you go into this film expecting a gritty exposé on the evils of trafficking you will be disappointed however if you sit back, but your brain in neutral and suspend your disbelief you should have a great time. Jason Statham is great in the role of Frank, playing it dead straight he made the unbelievable scenes believable; even when he drove a car off a bridge and landed on a car transporter and when he fought a room full of goons while covered in oil. Qi Shu was good as Lai although she didn't have too much to do. I liked François Berléand's portrayal of Inspector Tarconi; a policeman who clearly knew that Frank was up to something but never really made an attempt to catch him and even let him go when Frank pointed out that he could get to the bad guys so much faster than the police could. The many fights are all perfectly choreographed and the car chases and spectacular."

","i liked it. it took me a long time to finally watch one of these films (how many are there again?), but it was better than i expected.<br/><br/>i can't say i just love Luc Besson. i find him interesting but that's about it. i can't say i relate to a movie based on what? some BMW promo series on the internet? you gotta be kidding. how (no pun) commercial.<br/><br/>actually this film seemed loosely based on Walter Hill's film 'The Driver' which was much deeper and a better film. this film was just more cranked up and testosterone charged. that doesn't always make a better film. Walter Hill's film has a better script, is more reflective and is a good example of contemporary (contemporary enough, that was the 80's) film noir.<br/><br/>in defense of 'Transporter' i will say this. it wasn't Michael Bay, and at least in this first film (haven't seen the others), it used real stunts and not a lot of CGI stunts. i miss the old days when a stunt or an explosion was done for real and not just done with CGI (even when it's state of the art you can always tell it's CGI). it was to the 'Transporter's' credit that they actually staged pretty much all the stunts unlike 'Transformers' which had a lot of the action inter-spliced with CGI effects.<br/><br/>i didn't think the plot was so bad or nonexistent, it was just kind of simple. but it had a good message about not treating human beings like slaves or commodities. it was solidly directed if not a little too ""busy"", and the actors were likable and sexy and, let's face it, Jason Statham is outrageous to watch in action. a sort of European Bruce Lee.<br/><br/>not gonna make any attempt to say this was great cinema or anything, but it was entertaining, pretty much did what it professed to do, and it probably should be treated with a little bit more respect than it seems to have gotten from critics and audiences."

","Jason Statham plays Frank Martin a man works as a professional transporter. That means delivering or driving anyone without asking questions.<br/><br/>Statham is an unlikely action hero. From chased in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to boxing promoter in Snatch and now energetic action star challenging ""actors"" as Van Damme for the role as hard-kicking bad boy.<br/><br/>And he does a fine job too. Statham has a lot of presence and a lot more acting talent than other action stars. He might not be a Kevin Spacey but he can definitely get into character. Even if it happens to be the generic ""ex-special forces"" unwilling hero that just happens to be good at just about everything, except giving up that is.<br/><br/>French action movies are plenty in numbers now a days. This movie isn't bringing life into a stagnating movie industry. If anything this movie is contributing to it. This is, pretty much, a standard generic template. Some cool action stunts, fight scenes, car chase and some, but not much, snappy dialog.<br/><br/>In the end The Transporter is nothing more and nothing less than a good action flick. With Jason Statham as the main contributor that is.<br/><br/>This is also another one, albeit rather early, movie that carries the ""Luc Besson Label"". He was indeed involved as a writer and producer his name even puts director Louis Leterrier on the side. A director who, as a note, got to direct The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton. That these movies, with Bessons involvement, act as a springboard for directors and upcoming action stars is likely but also sets the standard for movies to come.<br/><br/>Still, Transporter was one of the earlier action movies, not groundbreaking or anything but very well worth viewing and by all likelihood even enjoying."

","i didn't really like it. Storyline wasn't very clear. It moved too quickly. I liked the stunts though, they were cool, sophisticated martial art style moves. The climax and ending was blunt and ended quickly. The whole movie...well.... not very clear. Not much action either, the relationship between Frank and Lai wasn't emphasised and shown clearly, which then lost the intended reaction at the end. Maybe the sequel would be better... Camera angles were good, the speed of the camera shots helped build the tension. The Transporter wasn't as good as I expected. So, in my opinion, this movie sort of disappointed me. I probably wouldn't recommend it. Adults may like this movie. I'm 15, so I would probably not recommend it, because it bored me a bit."

In this, he was the lead and tougher and way more cool and the fact that he did 99% of the stunts himself was impressive.<br/><br/>Personally, I would have liked to have seen much more actual ""transporting"" though, so we could enjoy more of the driving scenes. The ones we do see were cool, unbelievable, but enjoyable ! The soundtrack was good and Qi was an attractive choice - not sure why they needed to pass her off as Japanese though ?!

","While few people go to see an action film for a ""deep"" story line, most would like to see something that at least makes cohesive sense. And the simple fact of the matter is that The Transporter cannot even manage this. Sure, most of the action sequences are reasonably well choreographed, and Jason Statham is quite engaging as the titular character, but neither of these is enough to save a film that chokes on one of the worst scripts of the year. Luc Besson's fall from grace is complete. Even last year's Kiss of the Dragon was smarter than this - and that really is saying something. By the film's end, every single person I attended the screening with had two major complaints: First and foremost - how completely non-sensical the script was (to the point where Lai Kwai's actions have no motivating basis at virtually any point in the film). Secondly - one of the worst musical scores in film history. Mr Stanley Clarke, stand up and take a bow. Any score that so completely overplays the action scenes to the point where sound effects are actually lost in the mix, is one that is worthy of sincere disdain. There were plenty of other criticisms levelled, but these were the main two that really grated on all of us.<br/><br/>Do yourself the biggest of favours and avoid this tripe at all costs. Maybe, just maybe, The Transporter is worth a late night rental from the video store when you have absolutely nothing better to do and are in the mood to ""Spot the flaws"". But otherwise, just don't do it."

","If you go to see the Transporter with hopes of seeing something similar to ""Leon the Professional"" or ""The Fifth Element"", you are in for a complete disappointment.  The plot of ""The Transporter"" is WEAK and the action is completely un-inspired. You can see much better fight sequences from many of the standard action movies available (Matrix, Kiss of the Dragon) without the ultra cheesiness that came with this movie.<br/><br/>The heroine was an annoying character that became even more annoying due to her ""random"" transitions between english and mandarin. Don't worry, her dialogue wasn't worth subtitles so we didn't miss out on any translation.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie it seemed like Luc Besson was deliberately attempting to minimize the kill ratio in this movie, JUST to maintain a PG-13 rating (i.e. throwing a knife in between a persons legs vs. in his chest). Unfortunately in his bid to attract the 13 year olds, he alienated everybody else who had more than two brain cells and was able to vote.<br/><br/>The opening car scene is nothing more than a bad knock-off of the chase in Ronin.<br/><br/>EH!"

Its not the sad subservient eye candy female ""characters"" (not even cartoons, line drawings would be more accurate), I can do that, I'm a man for Pete's sake.

"Arctic_fox","4","2","4","17 August 2003"," Irrational action
","Well, I wouldn't have expected this kind of screenplay from the man who directed Fifth Element, Leon, Nikita and the Big Blue. If one would summarize the film in one sentence it would be: irrational action from the start. The plot was really illogical. For instance, why on earth would someone want to pay 40 000 dollars to someone to transport a daughter of a boss (who runs a criminal organization) to another place in the same country? Why didn't they do the `transport' themselves? It never came out why they wanted to transport the daughter to another place in France in the first place.<br/><br/>I don't like about films that contain impossible stunts either. What do you think about the following stunt: the key figure in the film jumps ten meters from a moving truck to another and performs a somersault from top of the truck keeping hold of the roof (?!) and smashes the windscreen kicking the bad guy inside the truck. What's the fun of watching a film like that? The film let's you think that the good guy must be a god, because he can perform actions what humans are not possibly able to do. Therefore, you (the viewer) think that there is absolutely nothing that can happen to the hero and there is no point watching the film, since you already know what's going to happen. Such stunts are logical when a robot from the future or someone in the matrix does them but humans aren't supposed to be able to do such actions. I think though that the actor, Jason Statham has talents and I hope he will be seen in more classy films in the future.<br/><br/>For your information directors and screenwriters: viewers are intelligent creatures and don't appreciate that you underestimate them. The films like The Transporter may interest viewers for a while, but in the long run they never make it in the big league."

A slick bad guy who could prove to be one of Bond's most deadly enemies if they decide to revive his character and turn him into a Bond villain sometime down the road.  He has the car, the weaponry, the physical fitness, the self defense mechanisms and the brains to hold it altogether.  The human smuggling story line is a very real one in today's world with borders disappearing everywhere and while this film has a good story line for this type of genre, the action is still first rate and doesn't disappoint."

","Frank Martin, provides the platinum standard among couriers: he will deliver any package, any where to any one, on time, no questions asked. Understandably,  his rates are a bit steeper than FedEx and his rules a bit more stringent. When he agrees to deliver a duffel bag Frank breaks Martin rule # 3  never look in  the package  only to discover that the contents are alive, kicking and beautiful.  What's a guy to do ?  Throw her back in the bag and complete the contract of course! Unfortunately Frank's employer is unhappy the indiscretion and his idea of a customer service complaint is to eliminate the server. <br/><br/>The opening frantic car chase through the streets and along the boardwalks of Nice, sets the tone for the for the rest of the movie  infused with equal parts action and humor you quickly realize  that this is not a film that  takes itself seriously.  Co-written and produced by  Luc Besson (The Professional and The Fifth Element) it follows in the vein of his earlier films:  reluctant protagonist who bends the rules to do his job, shows a little humanity inadvertently becoming a champion for the oppressed, and having to dodge bullets, bombs and badmen along the way. .   The lead captures this spirit.<br/><br/>Jason Statham's Frank is a no nonsense ex-special services minutia obsessed professional who refuses to be rattled even as the world is coming down around him (literally in one scene). Statham, best known as the fast talking Turkish in Snatch, possesses both the bulk and matter of fact glib finesse necessary to be an action hero.  The intricately choreographed and numerous marital arts sequences  - the best I've seen in a non Asian film  bear the trademarks of its Hong Kong predecessors and confirm that he also possesses the requisite physicality to carry a film in this genre. Statham may well turn out to be the next Bruce Willis (or at least his British counterpart.)<br/><br/>There are several glaring problems with this film: the people smuggling subplot seems to have been an afterthought,  the dialogue is often unintentionally laughable, and then there are those pesky laws of physics  But none of that matters - I wanted high octane fun and pyrotechnics, and I wasn't disappointed..

There is another hilarious scene where the hero chases down an airplane on foot, hijacks it, jumps out of the plane at great altitude in order to land on the back of a speeding transport with a conveniently located borrowed parachute!<br/><br/>There is plenty of action, Statham does display some pretty impressive moves but the frantic editing just doesn't do him justice. He obviously worked out for this part and there are frequent moments when his ripped torso is on display. He also (barely) manages to shy away any possible accusations that he's just a British novelty to American audiences.<br/><br/>A basic action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts.

It's set in the beautiful French riviera where we are once again reunited with Jason Statham in another action/crime packed movie.

All you need is likeable characters, excellent bad guys, the right amount of action, fighting, stunts, cars exploding way too much for no reason, romance and one man against the world story and you have made an iconic movie. It doesn't work every time but it worked this time.<br/><br/>Sound design - (Excellent. When I watched all the fight, action scenes the special effects gave satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out. Everything music-wise felt just right like you would expect.)<br/><br/>Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that Transporter vibe to everything.)<br/><br/>Stunts.

"phubbs","6","0","0","11 May 2019"," The Transporter
","Written and produced by iconic French action director Luc Besson, this was his second attempt to bring Asian action to the mainstream in Europe (and kinda crack into the US on a personal level). Yes Asian action was no secret back then (although it wasn't huge outside of Asia) but this was Asian action with French flair.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple. Ex-military man Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a transporter, a transporter of anything no questions asked. He has three rules; no names, no alterations to the deal, and don't look inside the package. Whilst delivering a package he notices it moving. Eventually, after much deep thought, he opens the package and discovers a bound and gagged female. He is somewhat shocked but carries on with his delivery.<br/><br/>Upon delivering the package to the client he is offered another job. Midway through this job the package explodes and almost kills him. The client, a Mr. Bettencourt (Matt Schulze) tricked him and tried to whack him because Martin broke the rules, he opened the package (kinda understandable actually). This obviously forces Martin to return to Bettencourt's estate and take vengeance by killing some of his men and stealing a car. Alas the car has the bound and gagged female inside. Martin must now protect himself and the woman who has also revealed that Bettencourt is trafficking people, so there's that too.<br/><br/>Now, this movie was never very original, not by a long shot. The fact that Besson was involved helped as he was seen as more of a cult director at the time. The Asian action blend and influence from director Corey Yuen was seen as fresh at the time. And Statham drew intrigue because here was an action man who wasn't your standard handsome A-list movie star with big muscles; he was British and looked and sounded more like a villain...with muscles.<br/><br/>With that being said there is enough to like here for sure. The first half of this movie is easily the better half as we are given a very likeable action thriller that is clearly very Besson-esque. We meet Martin who is a disciplined, calm and collected, suit-wearing professional who only speaks when necessary. He drives a souped-up, high spec, black BMW which he drives like a badass, but again only when required. The plot is basic but engaging and the action is swift and brutal but believable. It is only once Martin inadvertently saves the girl that things start to go downhill with silliness.<br/><br/>For a start it takes an age before we actually find out why this female (Lai played by Shu Qi) has been kidnapped, which is stupid. When she is picked up by Martin she has no real idea who he is and if he's trustworthy, yet she never really tries to escape. Hell, even when Martin takes her back to his place she STILL doesn't try to escape! I mean, this guy could be planning to rape and kill her, but she ends up totally trusting him, covering for him when the police show up, and even making him food! She basically gets all cozy with Martin without even knowing him or what his plans are and considering her situation, it's weird.<br/><br/>Things get even more out of hand when the bad guys show up in the middle of the day armed to the teeth with guns and rocket launchers and destroy Martin's residence. All this in clear view of anyone, but nothing happens and no police are called. Luckily Martin has yet another luxurious residence not too far away (of course) so it's all good. And the female he rescued (who is kinda his captive now) offers sex to make up for all the trouble she's caused, because of course she does. The really odd thing though is Lai trusts and helps Martin so much throughout the movie, but when it comes to a point when Martin really does need her verbal assistance with a confrontation between the police and the bad guys, she doesn't say a word!<br/><br/>I must also point out the quite terrible musical score throughout this picture. An odd blend of your typical action themes with soft orchestral moments which feel completely out of place for the most part. It really is quite weird because at times it makes the movie feel like a low budget production, like it's been tacked on because they had nothing else to use.<br/><br/>Anyone who knows Luc Besson will know this movie and just what to expect. We all know Besson has a hitman/hitwoman fetish and since his 1990 offering 'Nikita' has essentially done the same thing time and time again switching between male and female leads. Although 'The Transporter' is nowhere near as solid in overall quality as his earlier hitman flicks (the other being 'Leon' in 1994), this first offering does still have plenty to enjoy. It's just a shame that the movie slowly degenerates into a stupid mess which was eventually doubled down on with the even stupider sequels.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","""The Transporter"" is an action film that focuses on Frank Martin (Jason Statham), who is a private driver for illegal cargo, such as people and money. The plot follows him in the south of France, where he activates. His work is led by three simple rules, which he almost always obeys. However, this changes, with Frank breaking the three rules constantly, which gets him in trouble with the police and with a very influential man.<br/><br/>This being a movie directed by Luc Besson, it features a lot of intense car chases, beautifully combined with occasional fights. Similar to ""Taxi"", this film is based in Provence, featuring heavily-modified and fast vehicles. In the beginning, Frank is driving a black BMW 735i which is then replaced by a stolen Mercedes S-Class. In my opinion, the performances of all actors are very strong, mainly Jason Statham's and François Berléand's, who plays Inspector Tarconi.<br/><br/>However, there are some minor letdowns, chief among which is the continuity of details. First of all, certain features of the cars vary from one scene to another, such as the BMW jumping off the bridge in the opening scene having tinted windows while the one in the rest of the movie doesn't, or the fact that the Mercedes has its grille in place immediately after crashing through a gate, but in the next scene it is hanging off. Moreover, after the oil fight, Frank is seen swimming away from the attackers, and in the next scene his trousers are clean and dry. Another disappointment is that there are many similarities to ""Taxi"", like the way the French Police is regarded useless.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Transporter"" is a memorable and gripping film that is worthwhile, even if it is slightly disjointed and a bit far-fetched as the plot unfolds."
"bowmanblue","8","0","0","25 March 2019"," 90s style action in the 00s
","'The Transporter' may not be Jason Statham's introduction into the world of on-screen action heroes, but it was certainly the film that cemented his potential as more of an 'old school' tough guy. Since the early 2000s, action films developed a severe case of over-seriousness. Gone were the days of witty quips and wry smiles of the Arnie and Stallone era, replaced with grim protagonists and gritty surroundings.<br/><br/>That's why 'The Transporter' is so great. It totally knows what it is, i.e. big, dumb fun that's only trying to entertain, rather than deliver any sort of 'message.' Jason Statham plays 'Frank' an ex American marine with possibly the most 'questionable' American accent ever (seriously, it flits between London and New York approximately ever other word!). He specialises in driving for a living, or rather driving anything illegal from point A to point B in a severe hurry.<br/><br/>However, his professional attitude to his work is severely tested when he begrudgingly opens the boot of his car during a job, only to find a young Chinese girl tied up in there. Naturally, his conscious is tested and it's up to him whether to deliver this girl to her - obvious - fate, or help her out. Luckily for her, she's quite pretty and therefore makes up the perfect love interest to our bald, rugged anti-hero.<br/><br/>I would probably say that there's zero original content in this film. If you've watched enough action films then you've pretty much seen everything here and possibly done better. However, that isn't really too much of a criticism as 'The Transporter' is just such damn good fun. It has good looking heroes, evil dastardly villains, beautiful locations, great action and punch-ups. But, most of all, it never takes itself seriously in the same way as the 'pre-Craig' Bond movies did.<br/><br/>And, if all that isn't enough to get you sit down and watch it - for the ladies - you get one hell of a look at a totally oiled-up Jason Statham, beating one goon after the other while he slips, slides and slaps his way through the bad guys - all gooey and topless. Obviously, I was just there for the action. Obviously."

","I had a great time watching The Transporter.<br/><br/>It's a pure popcorn entertainer with terrific action, and a great story too.<br/><br/>It's not a dramatic or very serious film, it's meant to be enjoyed and I'm telling you that if you like action movies, this movie is not to be missed.<br/><br/>It's another highly entertaining French action film written by Luc Besson, one of the best action movie screenwriters.<br/><br/>Jason Statham is obviously a delight to watch! He plays a very sharply written character bound by rules and discipline. He really kills it in the uniquely crafted action sequences. You get to see a very balanced and ideal kind of action hero in the form of Frank Martin, the character played by him. The cast is full of great characters and almost everyone gets a good share in the film.<br/><br/>And yes, it's an out-and-out action film, so action lovers are definitely in for a treat. All the nonstop action is captured and executed very well. Several moves are so great that you might want to rewind and see them again. Explosions and car chases are done brilliantly, while it's the fight sequences which have been done with extreme sincerity and perfection.<br/><br/>Given that it's a 2002 film, The Transporter (or Le Transporteur) stands tall as per action movie standards. It's still quite fresh and fun to watch although you'll find some elements to be similar in movies that came after it (even today). Still, it's the freshness in the execution, uniqueness in the script and excellence in the action that makes The Transporter an all-time entertaining French action classic. Must watch."

Statham was Excellent as one of the expendables in the great action packed trilogy & was fantastic in The Mechanic & Home front films he also was very cool in Death Race & Ghosts of mars but i honestly liked him best in this first Transporter film!!! 
Here we see & witness Statham become the brutal action hero we all know now!!! But this felt like his Die Hard or his Taken & so on as this action packed Thriller was his big action break & his trademark role & has become an action cult classic.
Statham here is a nice mix of bruce Willis (his bald head & stubbled face) & Van damme (his ripped body & fighting moves) & he really is cool to watch especially the ""oil fight"" that's a great fight scene & yes this has the usual corny & cheesy bits but that's what makes this movie a throwback to those old school action films, this is a very slick looking film with tons of Action & stunts but still on the lower budget side & that's very cool!!! 
Frank Martin is a cool character but only the first film is good the others are TERRIBLE & try to be like a fast & furious film & i HATE that franchise!!! But yeah wanna see Statham do action old school style & be very cool then see this first entry.
A little cult classic action movie that's a lot of fun probably still Statham's best solo movie? or at least i enjoyed this one the most so far"

","Frank Martin (Statham) is an ex-Special Forces soldier who now lives alone in a picturesque region of France. When his friend Inspector Tarconi (Berleand) makes occasional visits to his fortress-like home, Martin maintains that he's left the fighting life behind him and now lives on his Army pension alone. The truth is that Martin is a master Martial Artist and expert driver who employs his prodigious skills for whoever pays his price, and whoever agrees to follow his strict set of rules. Things get complicated when a super-evil businessman known only as Wall Street (Schulze) hires Martin - and then Martin realizes that he's transporting a live human in a bag - a woman named Lai (Qi). Together, Martin and Lai uncover a smuggling ring and a conspiracy that will hit everyone very close to home. Battling many goons to get close to the truth, will Frank Martin be the TRANSPORTER of justice? Find out today!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Top fan favorite Jason Statham in a movie co-written by Luc Besson and co-directed by Corey Yuen? Sign us up! Indeed, The Transporter lives up to the promise inherent in these names - it's a fast paced, professionally-shot, and totally enjoyable action outing that's easy to love. The French locations are beautiful and make a nice change of pace for the setting for an action movie, and the car chase and driving scenes are all the better for occurring in these locales. This was the first feature film for co-director Leterrier, and he and Yuen show they know how to deliver the action goods. Between the car action, the gun-shooting, missile-shooting, and Hong Kong-style Martial Arts, the movie breezes by in a blur of entertaining goodness. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
It's easy to see why this garnered two more sequels and a TV spin-off - it's a simple, enjoyable premise and the end result lives up to, and exceeds, audience expectations. While we wouldn't necessarily recommend the sequels, especially the second installment, what we would recommend is the Japanese DVD, if you can find it. It's an uncut version that contains more violence than other DVD issues to date. However, it's certainly not mandatory you find that in order to fully enjoy The Transporter - from action newbies to die-hard fans, it delivers the goods and surely a great time will be had by all who see it. <br/><br/>Featuring a notable score by Stanley Clarke, and action scenes galore (the garage oil slick scene is a particular highlight), The Transporter is a gem."
"Leofwine_draca","6","0","0","22 November 2016"," Brisk and slick French action thriller
","A sleek and efficient action thriller from the guys who brought you KISS OF THE DRAGON. Although not equalling the heights of that particular movie, this is nevertheless a fully enjoyable tale of big bad guys, slimy bad guys, a lone action hero and a pretty tag-along Chinese girl (Shu Qi, who manages to be annoying, but not too much). The setting, once again, is France, so expect lots of breakneck car chases through the streets of Nice, some stunning locations, and lots of outrageous staged action sequences which will have you shaking your head in amazement – in a good way. Jason Statham is, it has to be said, no Jet Li, but instead he brings a kind of hardman toughness to his performance as the skinheaded hero, who strips off his shirt to battle the bad guys time and time again. I like Statham, and I hope to see him in more action movies to come. Out of the cast members, only Francois Berleand really shines as the friendly French cop.<br/><br/>The plot is nonsensical and full of holes, the script inconsequential. Even the bad guys are less bad than before, with the exception of Matt Schulze as the annoyingly 'yuppie' style smuggler and Ric Young as the stretched-face Chinese villain of the piece. However, the action comes thick and fast, from shoot-outs to hang-glider action and axe-fights to the death. Although this film does shy away from showing violent death, the martial arts battles are fast and furious, especially the oil slick tumble and the fight in the bus. Action fans should stick around for the truck-chase finale, which is exceptional stuff and includes one of the funniest deaths for a villain I've ever seen. Well-shot and slickly edited, my only problem is with the out of place music, rap and stuff like that, which I'm not a fan of, and which is pretty intrusive early on. Luckily it fades out come the thrill-ride of a finish."

","I don't think I've ever witnessed a movie that so thrives on a strangely dumb likability as ""The Transporter"". I felt a very European ""The Fast and the Furious"" vibe from this (not just the Matt Schulze connection), only not so insulting to the brain. There's no use coming to this with knives sharpened; it's inviting in its mindlessness.<br/><br/>To wit: Jason Statham's a conveyor of goods for various criminal enterprises, and his every action is governed by a code of rules. Obviously, he'll come to break those rules and find himself in hot water with the bad guys as a result. Cue the series of physically impossible fight scenes. It's not hard to see where this thing's headed, but somehow, it doesn't make you want to slap yourself. All of this absurdity rests on the icy coolness of Statham, a man rising to the occasion without reservation. He's why something so flimsy can actually work. Even when he's fighting thugs on an oil slick, it's still engaging.<br/><br/>I liked it just as much today as I did in 2002. I've got no interest in the sequels, granted, but as a standalone, it's a fun movie.<br/><br/>7/10"

","So this is the breakout movie for Jason Statham and the first movie where he plays as the lead role. I didn't much think of this actor when this film first debuted. But he really built himself up to be one of the most well known action stars out there. I remember watching this movie as a kid and thought it was alright, maybe because I was a big Jet Li fan back then. Sure this film can be slightly corny in today's standards and the chase and action sequences are ridiculous. But a movie like this shouldn't be taken seriously. And it seems to get even more ridiculous and even more over the top with each installment. So the plot is about this guy named Frank Martin who is a Ex-Special Forces Operator and topnotch driver that transports people or objects from one destination to another for a fee. Even if the task is dangerous, so in a way he is a getaway driver. He has three rules. Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know whom he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. The last two rules puts him at a disadvantage in my opinion, especially since he works for dangerous guys. From the dialogue to the anti-hero to bad guys interactions is very cliché, but it's one of those action movies that because of the simple and yet fun action sequences. Even if the characters directions and decisions doesn't make much sense either. Mainly because it doesn't try to be more than what it is, while it having effort and well choreographed sequences in it mixed in with humor. This is a cool (although a bit corny now) and stylish action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. So overall, this movie despite the mediocre character development and story it connects well enough with the cool action sequences to make it worth a rental and made it worth a watch in the theaters when it came out.<br/><br/>7.1/10"

Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a former Special Forces officer who lives on the French Mediterranean and has a lucrative second career as a underworld courier for hire. Martin will deliver anything anywhere, but he has three iron-clad rules - once the plan is in motion it cannot be changed, neither he nor his customers are to ever use their real names, and under no circumstances will he open the package. Martin is hired to make a delivery to a wealthy but unscrupulous American known as Wall Street (Matt Schulze), but after taking possession of the package he realizes that whatever is inside happens to be alive. Breaking his own rule, Martin opens the bag to discover a beautiful Asian woman, Lai (Shu Qi), who is bound and gagged. Lai briefly escapes, but Martin captures her, and delivers her to Wall Street as promised. However, after being given a parcel to deliver by Wall Street, Martin finds out what Wall Street is up to - in partnership with Lai's father Mr. Kwai (Ric Young), Wall Street is part of a scheme to smuggle Asian illegal aliens into France. Martin's conscience gets the better of him, and he sets out to rescue Lai and put Wall Street and Mr. Kwai out of business; however, as if this wasn't enough of a challenge, Martin discovers a French detective, Tarconi (Francois Berleand) has gotten wind of his illegal business."

","While it certainly won't win any awards for originality (nor did it), THE TRANSPORTER is probably the best solo vehicle for Jason Statham that I've seen up to this point (to include stuff that has come out more recently). It's an all-thrills, no frills action movie with minimal character development and a logically incoherent plot, but the action sequences and Jason Statham's charisma as a leading man more than make up for the flaws in the narrative. Certain elements date it a little bit (a few soundtrack cuts in particular), and it almost feels like a relic of the 90's except for the fact that this came out in 2002. Still, I have great nostalgia for these types of movies and I had a great time watching it. Not only that, but there was some humor peppered into the mix which makes it contrast favorably to other movies that take themselves a little too seriously. Overall, this is a must-see if you're a fan of Jason Statham or action movies in general."

But, Yuen, in the director's chair, doesn't know how to shoot those fight scenes, or the car chase scenes.<br/><br/>The cinematography, such as it is, is shaky-cam. And, it is too close up. We know that Statham can fight, so by doing the close-up stuff, and doing too much cutting, it undercuts the stuntwork, and it makes you think that they had to cut because the actor couldn't do full, uncut fight scenes.<br/><br/>The story has okay ideas, but even in 92 minutes, the movie is narratively uneven, so it basically starts and stops at irregular intervals.<br/><br/>The Stanley Clarke film score seems divorced from the film, like it was something he wrote separately, and the editors just kind of cut and pasted it into the movie. A disappointing effort. The franchise is being restarted in 2015, so I am hoping for better then.<br/><br/>***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)"

","Being a Jason Statham fan, I had downloaded the Transporter trilogy to watch and hopefully enjoy. Having seen the first one, it was ludicrous. I was laughing at its ridiculousness and at some points, I was cringing. Frankly the only cringe-worthy aspect of this movie is the actress who played Lai. I'll give her credit, for someone who doesn't usually speak the English language she spoke it well, but it doesn't make up for her bad acting. She's not the worst actress ever, but she wasn't that great.<br/><br/>The plot is unrealistically silly and just an excuse for Jason to kick some butt, and that's totally fine by me. This is a movie where people talk instead of shoot, and only use guns when there's a convenient opening for the hero to escape. Jason plays Frank Martin, a driver-for-hire who will drive children to school or act as the getaway for a group of thieves, or deliver anything--no questions asked. He's got three rules: no changing the deal, no names, and never open the package.<br/><br/>Soon enough, he's given a job to transport a package that just happens to be a woman named Lai, and from there, things get complicated. He simply gives her a drink, but that still breaks one of his rules, and before he knows it, his car explodes shortly after making the delivery. This gets Frank tangled up in a human trafficking operation that he feels obliged to stop, partly because Lai is one of the key figures in it.<br/><br/>We've got catching up to speeding trucks on parachutes, grease fights, bike pedal kicks to the face, and legions of henchmen battling a shirtless one man army. It's fun and entertaining if you can suspend disbelief. If you're looking for something more realistic, look elsewhere."

His second rule is no names, no human connection with people. His first, no change of plans - the story stays the same.<br/><br/>We see a first demo drive; where we would expect lots of crashing around a la the Vin Diesel franchise his driving is slick, miraculously so. He even lands his BMW from a bridge to a space just right for it on a towing truck in motion.<br/><br/>In one of his rounds he breaks his rule and this introduces the unpredictable human element in the gears, a woman, that alters the story.<br/><br/>The first time he escapes death he ends up with her back at his place. The second, he dives with her deep in the waters and of course in the next beat she gets out of her clothes and throws herself on him - the underwater scene COULD have been more sensual (not to mention a more veiled sex), scuba diving is after all Besson's Proustian madeleine of childhood memory.<br/><br/>Besson's sensibilities are all right for this and he matches them with a Chinese director at the helm. This guy had done according to IMDb extensive kung fu work in his country that he brings here - the fights are in the Hong Kong style that Chan made famous, so more akin to choreographed dance than real violence. Not great in this style, but no one does it any more so again it sticks.<br/><br/>The most amusing set piece here has Statham and a dozen goons rolling around in grease and trying to stand up, it's purely a slapstick dance number which ends with Statham gliding on the floor and out of the scene - you can see how the musical would go.<br/><br/>This sense of danced fun bounced off against a Statham who can contain his amused smirk just enough makes up for the unexciting car chase mechanics; Vin Diesel is the go to guy for that. The formulaic plot and cheesy villains all add to this throwback videocassette-rental sense."

Yes, there are other things to address but those things will come. This is perhaps one of the few films people can enjoy that deals with consistent movement (like the The Fast and the Furious (2001) franchise in a way). <br/><br/>The story is about an ex-military man, Frank Martin (Statham), who is covertly working as a transporter for hire - a man who basically moves things from one place to another. No questions are asked about what he's transporting; that's not apart of his deal. If the deal is broken, so are the rules and that's basically how things unfold. Upon taking what seems to be a routine job of ""transporting"", Martin discovers there may be more at stake and breaks his code of the deal. Thus ensuing him in a load of trouble. Of course, nothing he couldn't handle though and that's actually the surprising part of this movie.<br/><br/>The screenwriters behind this movie are Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. Before this time, Besson was best known for writing Léon: The Professional (1994) and Kamen had written for The Karate Kid (1984). To many, those are extremely well written works. In six years they would write for Liam Neeson's Taken (2008). I guess they're writing slipped a little in quality around this time. That's not to say their writing is bad, it's just predictably clichéd. There are only a few areas that stand out. The areas that are clichéd are the one's dealing with character development in the protagonists and the knowledge of the antagonists.<br/><br/>Statham playing an ex-militant is pretty much the same as how most ex- militant characters are written. They like working alone, but yet end up finding a love interest. They also have retained their martial arts and survival skills since their retirement, which allows them to fight their opponents with ease. It was actually more interesting in the beginning of the movie because it wasn't all about taking on 5 times as many opponents as it was getting the job of ""transporting"" done. Before the action finale to the film, Statham played a much slicker character - almost like a cheaper version of a James Bond. It was cool to watch him be clever and evade authorities by his driving skills or name changing license plates.<br/><br/>Accompanying Mr. Martin in his travels is the thing that makes him break his rules; a girl named Lai (Qi Shu). Here, she explains to Martin in her best English about a crate shipment of people that are being given to some wealthy guy. It's actually not clearly stated what is purpose of this. Illegal immigration? Slave labor? What? Matt Schulze plays the wealthy bad guy and he doesn't play badly at it either. In fact, viewers may find his performance a little more energetic than Statham's. Not sure if it was meant to be that way, but Statham pretty much plays it straight faced. I would like to know how Schulze's character was able to track Martin wherever he went though. It's a little preposterous since there was no clear indication on how Martin's place of living was discovered.<br/><br/>When it comes to action sequences however, that's a different matter. Since Statham is well equipped for this type of genre, there is no doubt Statham knows what he's doing, and those scenes filmed will be entertaining. Which leads to a very specific moment that must be pointed out - the oil slick fight. This particular scene isn't something action fans may see every day. It's a very unique action sequence and it's quite baffling to know how it could've been executed. The music provided by Stanley Clarke was an interesting take too. The sound mix contained some orchestra but mostly jazz work tones that actually meshed well with the scenes that were filmed. It surprised me. Overall, it's your standard Statham film. Nothing far from what's already been made.<br/><br/>The Transporter had a good premise and started out with class (thanks to the music). By the end though, it's a standard Jason Statham action movie that has consistent flow and doesn't have bad pacing."

Works great, but sometimes he is against dozens of bad guys and none of the bad guys seem to have a gun. Especially at the end, gets too ridiculous in this. All those bad guys should have at least a gun. I mean, they look like they get pay for defend the main bad guys. Maybe that is the least I like about the movie. But is not too bad. You might forgive that.<br/><br/>I didn't like the girl actress work. Was not convincing many times, for some reason. Is like sometimes acts very different from what you would expect.

","When you watch a Statham action film you go in knowing exactly what you'll get; a lot of action and violence and kicking with maybe a bit of plot to tie it all together. Transporter delivers on all fronts and actually exceeds expectations on the last one with a bit more story than you might expect though there are certainly gaps and it certainly is not the main focus, the main focus is watching Statham kick people. Most of the film is him beating up a bunch of disposable assassins as he travels with Lai (Shu Qi) a former 'package' who he broke his cardinal rule for and ended up helping and in that sense it does not disappoint. Nothing deep but that's not why you go to see this kind of film, you go to see the action and eat popcorn and for that it is definitely recommended.

","Just watched Transporter 1 and 2 so this review will be about both. And I won't be able to explain my point without some spoilers. Both movies are equally as good, or bad, depending on your opinion, and I suspect the same about the third, which is unusual for sequels.<br/><br/>Transporter is a good action flick if you can suspend your disbelief, and I mean really suspend. Here are the spoilers to prove my point. The transporter is fighting off a couple dozen baddies in a fist fight. After he knocks them all out he reaches in one of their pockets and takes out a gun. Why didn't they use their guns? Who knows. The filmmakers didn't even bother to make up some far fetched explanation like having the boss tell them not to use their guns because it will attract attention. Don't worry about it, just shut off your brain and enjoy the action.<br/><br/>The transporter paraglides out of a plane and catches up to a truck going down the highway and lands on the roof. Another time he catches up to a helicopter in a car.<br/><br/>Here's a zinger that had me laughing out loud. The Transporter is driving with a bomb under his car which is about to go off. What would you do? Well I would get out as fast as I can and run. What does he do? He finds some perfectly placed ramp that lifts one side of the car up and rolls it around so that a crane hook can just catch the bomb sticking to the bottom and pull it off just as it explodes while the car continues to roll 360° and lands on its wheels and he keeps driving.<br/><br/>Here's another great laugh. The transport and the head bad guy are fighting it out in an airplane. The pilot is killed and the plane goes out of control into a nose dive. You're thinking well here come some unbelievable stunt where now he knows how to fly a plane and manages to pull it out of a spin that even expert pilots can't do. But you'd be wrong, because it's even more over the top than that. The plane actually hits the water head on. Neither of them are in a seat or have a seat belt on. Yet the plane simply hits the water, stops completely intact, then sinks, with both passengers alive and swimming in the water that starts filling the cabin. Think of a bus falling into the water off a pier and that's was a jet nosediving into the water at 600mph looks like. Oh god, I can't stop laughing even now.<br/><br/>So if you're an action junkie these films will really appeal to you. Lots of car chases, fist fights, and gun play. If the silly factor turns you off at all then run the other way, or maybe get in your car and fly through the air in a couple barrel rolls away from it."

","Ah. The movie that introduced me to Jason Statham. Unfortunately, it took me a long time to get to this film.<br/><br/>I was very hesitant to see The Transporter, much as I was to watch my first Jackie Chan film (Supercop.) So it was years after release, and instantly I took to Statham's charm, acting, charisma and fighting ability. By the time I watched this, part 2 was already headed to theaters (which I did see on the big screen) and part 3 was planned.<br/><br/>But, I digress. This one involves an ex-super soldier who, well, ""transports"" items/people from one locale to another using basic and fundamental rules to make a living. And he's good at it, despite a noisy French officer. The transporter, Frank (Statham) gets inadvertently caught up in a human-smuggling ring and though he likes anonymity (obviously) he regains somewhat a heart and helps a victim and tries to stop the bad guys.<br/><br/>Really. If you cherish the Jackie Chan movies, you'll like this one. You know what I'm talking about. Barely a plot. Barely good acting. Less plot, more kick-butt. You'll then like this action vehicle.<br/><br/>I don't really like comparing Statham to Chan, as they are 100% different, but they do produce similar movies. While Chan has a certain charm for his fan base, Statham also has his own way of producing charisma for the audience. And he got me hooked.<br/><br/>Best scenes involve NO CGI or any special effects (something part two of this series should've taken note of but failed) and just having Statham driving or hand-to-hand combat. Just his character's depth and fighting technique is worth the time, money and effort into watching what would've actually been a run-of-the-mill average foreign action flick. Recommended!"

","Corey Yuen has directed some low-budget action films but in 2002 he directed a great action flick called The Transporter, which stars Jason Statham. Jason Statham's first film was brilliant and he became better and better in acting from then on. It was in 2002 that he starred in an action flick and finally showed off his Kickboxing and other skills and it was really great. From the first scene I had a feeling that this was going to get better after twenty minutes and I was right 100%. The story gets more interesting and more characters are introduced, good and bad. Jason Statham's character is all calm and careful and that is cool but when it comes to someone messing with him and his car, he really unleashes his dark side and believe me that all hell is going to break loose. The stunts and choreography are fantastic, so well done stunt men and choreographers. The character, played by Qi Shu, is pretty exceptional and her humor is funny. Her lack of vocabulary is a weak side to her character and you need subtitles sometimes to understand what she is saying. The villain Wall Street, played my Matt Schulze, is totally ridiculous in acting and he doesn't look like a villain but a wanna be villain. The boring scenes were revolting and they all contain the French cop. They contain blah-blah-blah and that stops the story a little bit.<br/><br/>Ex-Special Forces operator Frank Martin lives what seems to be a quiet life along the French Mediterranean, hiring himself out as a mercenary ""transporter"" who moves goods--human or otherwise--from one place to another. No questions asked. Carrying out mysterious and sometimes dangerous tasks in his tricked-out BMW, Frank adheres to a strict set of rules, which he never breaks. Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know whom he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. Frank's newest transport seems no different from the countless ones he's done in the past. He's been hired by an American known only as ""Wall Street"" to make a delivery; but when Frank stops along the route, he notices his package is moving. Violating Rule Three, Frank looks inside the bag, finding its contents to be a beautiful, gagged woman. Frank's steadfast adherence to his other two rules--which make up his basic code of survival--also quickly fails, hurtling him and his new companion on a road leading to shocking secrets, deadly complications, and the last thing that Frank ever expected to come to believe: that rules are made to be broken. (Copied from IMDb) <br/><br/>The action scenes are very lethal and smart with a little bit of coolness. When he took off his shirt while he was fighting enemies, it showed that he was a show-off who liked his body. The action scenes never disappoint or get boring as Frank Martin terminates enemies, tough scrawny. Sometimes it would look fake,(Spoiler!!!) like when he survived the bombing on his house (Spoiler End!!!), but it can be real as well. Mmmmmm? The end scene was very awesome and very James Bond like. As far as the story goes, it doesn't disappoint but it feels like it is clichéd, somehow.Corey Yuen did a good job at directing this film while Luc Besson did fantastic writing the story. The car chase scenes look realistic and that's why you should watch this movie. I would recommend this to any film lover that likes a solid action flick. It is not a masterpiece but definitely worth a peek. The sequel is even better but the the third one sucked balls."

It's okay if her English is a bit broken but she screams in many many parts of the film like she's trying to act cute and makes Jason wants to protect her or what.

","Frank Martin is the transporter, a bad ass guy who transports criminals or their requests for a price. As long as the criminals play by his rules, Martin doesn't have a problem. This is readily apparent in the opening scene when Martin argues with four criminals who pile into his BMW, claiming they only said there would be three passengers. Martin doesn't budge until they acquiesce, which means offing one of themselves. Jason Statham inhabits the role of the transporter perfectly, but a promising film for the first fifteen minutes gets bogged down with a script that disappoints the audience. On his second job, Martin almost immediately breaks one of his own rules, and the film loses some steam as the character commits some blunders the audience doesn't expect of a bad ass guy. The film becomes more formulaic during the scenes when the female lead (Qi Shu) has screen time. Martin gets mixed up in human trafficking and of course the girl too. Technically, the film has multiple continuity errors which are more noticeable than in most films. Statham and the terrific action sequences make the film watchable, however over the top they are. The fight scenes are good, but the opening car chase is the highlight of the film. Luc Besson produced the film and co-wrote the screenplay which is inconsistent in tone, and action specialist Corey Yuen directed the film. **1/2 of 4 stars."

In this movie, Jason Statham plays Frank Martin, a man who is a freelance transporter who is hired to deliver a package to an American gangster known as Darren ""Wall Street"" Bettencourt (Matt Schulze). Frank has 4 rules when it comes to transporting and they are ""Never Change The Deal"", ""No Names"", Never Open The Package"" and ""Never Make A Promise You Can't Keep"". He eventually breaks one of the rules by opening the package which turns out to be a kidnapped woman named Lai (Shu Qi). He eventually delivers the package to Wall Street but gets double crossed and now Frank must help Lai by rescuing enslaved people from China. Jason Statham does a great job in this movie and not to mention doing his own stunts as well. Also I like the car chase scenes and the cars placed in this movie.

","'The Transporter' defined Jason Statham as action star but I think he deserves better as we have all seen his great acting abilities in debut movies ('Lock, Stock...' and 'Snatch'). This movie really starts fine as we are introduced with Frank Martin, ex soldier, who is a mercenary ""transporter"". He moves goods from one place to another and he does it with no questions asked. So one day Frank breaks his own rules and he looks at the moving package. There he founds tied women. Of course he decides to help her...<br/><br/>Entrance car chase as we watch what Frank is doing for living has resemblance with Pirès/Besson 'Taxi' scenes and the whole story is set in France also. There are also clear reference with movies like 'Léon' or 'Ronin'. But never mind that, 'The Transporter' has obvious problems with reality, like lots of todays action movies. There are too many great explosions, our heroes special skills (drives with his feet, holds under truck at high speeds, bullets are not even wounding him...) and unbelievable acting from some actors (Matt Schulze is trying so hard to be bad that that is funny). There are some good fighting scenes with oil, on bus or at containers. Also Statham is good, Qi Shu pretty and François Berléand is French Alan Rickman (they look very similar to me). <br/><br/>To say long story short; good action, brainless fun with new action star Jason Statham!"

","Back in the year 2003 I saw for the first time the English actor Jason Statham in the magnificent film ""Snatch"" (2000) and soon after in ""Look, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) so in consequence I became in a big fan of Statham. I can't remember well the release of ""The Transporter"" in Mexico but I do remember when the sequel was released, mostly for the many advertisements when it was premiered in cable TV. I really feel desires to watch them but for some strange reasons I never watch them but I do watch ""Crank"" (2006) and it was a big disappointment to me so after that I never look out for the transporter filmsuntil the last weekend that I found the DVD of this one in a great price so I decide to get it and watch it.<br/><br/>The film is about Frank (Statham) who is an ex-military that now lives in France and works as a transporter of anything, of course illegal things too. He has three personal rules for his job: 1. ""Never change the deal"" 2. ""No names"" 3. ""Never open the package"". But when he his hired for transport a kidnapped girl named Lai (Shu Qi) he broke the rule number 3 so his life is in real danger and suddenly he enters in the criminal world and becomes the only hope for four hundred people being smuggled.<br/><br/>I really love the first part of this film, for me Frank is a really great character of course because of his interesting job and also because of the very impressive way that he works, being a real and cool professional. The first sequence is great showing his great abilities for drive his BMW and his great precision for save the problems of his clients, only if you don't break any rule. Later when he meets Lai is when the real action begins and that's all.<br/><br/>In making-of featurette of the DVD, Statham and company claim that Cory Yuen is the very best for action sequences. For me the action sequences in this film are good, with the great fact that Statham did every of his difficult sequences, but definitely I have seen better stuff.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I really enjoyed this film, is just great and very cool the character of Jason Statham and the 90 minutes goes amazingly fast. I also liked the strange combination of three different languages so I recommend this film to anyone, mostly fans of the genre, who wants to enjoy 90 minutes of pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Region 4 DVD: It's actually really good for the low price. Contains commentaries by Statham and the producer, extended versions of three fight sequences and like I said a making-of featurette that is good but very short. Well soon I'm going to get part 2."

There are a few slow sections of the movie (normally when someone bothers to explain what's going on) but it's worth watching for the action sequences. Jason Statham performs his martial arts moves pretty well and the fight scenes are surprisingly inventive. I particularly liked the use of bicycle pedals in one scene! The use of CGI in the big action set pieces is kept to a discreet minimum, so there's plenty to wince at as cars (and characters) get thrown about like toys.<br/><br/>There was some sort of plot but it's best ignored.

","Frank Martin is a ""transporter"", which in this context seems to be a euphemism for ""courier to the criminal fraternity"". For the right fee he delivers ""packages"" around Europe, subject to three self-imposed rules. First, he will never change the terms of a deal once it has been agreed. Second, he will ask no questions about the identity of the persons with whom he is dealing. Third, he will ask no questions about the contents of the package- and will certainly never open it. The film deals with what happens when Frank breaks his third rule. On one journey he notices that a package, which he had assumed contained something inanimate, is moving, and obviously contains something living. Frank opens it to find that what has been consigned to his care is actually a beautiful young Chinese woman.<br/><br/>Frank now begins to question his amoral, no-questions-asked philosophy. He learns that the girl is called Lai, and that the men who hired him to transport her are involved, together with her father, in an illegal scheme to smuggle Chinese immigrants into Europe. Frank decides to protect Lai, but in doing so he discovers that both he and she are in danger from the ruthless people-smuggling gang.<br/><br/>Jason Statham seems to be Britain's first entrant into the world of the tough-guy action hero, previously dominated either by Americans (Stallone, Segal, Diesel) or Continental Europeans (Schwarzenegger, Van Damm, Lundgren). On the evidence of this film, he seems to be able to act a bit (something that cannot be said of all his rivals) and makes Frank a stylish hero, a mixture of East-End bovver boy and James Bond. On the one hand his expensive BMW cars, his smart tailor-made suits and his elegant home (a converted lighthouse) on the French Riviera speak of a Bond-like sophistication. On the other, his skinhead-type haircut and his tough-guy manner betray his working-class roots. (He would have been more convincing as a Cockney, but attempted to play the role with an American accent, doubtless to pacify that section of the American market that regards British English, especially when spoken with anything other than a ""posh"" accent, as an incomprehensible foreign tongue).<br/><br/>In many ways, in fact, I felt that Frank was a hero worthy of a better film than this one. The film's numerous chase sequences show the influence of the Bond films (especially the sequence near the beginning where Frank uses his driving skills to escape from the police, at one point making a daring leap to insert his car onto the upper deck of a car transporter), but it lacks the wit and style which are the hallmark of the Bond series. The nearest it gets is a sort of grim gallows humour. (Frank refuses to drive the getaway car for a gang of bank robbers because there are four of them, rather than three as he had been led to believe, so the leader of the gang solves the problem by shooting dead one of his own men). The film also lacks a notable leading lady. Shu Qi is a well-known actress in the Far East, but this was her first English-language film, and she did not seem fluent enough in the language to be a credible heroine.<br/><br/>As with most films of this type, spectacular action is more important than plausibility; the action sequences generally involve feats that would be improbable, or even impossible, in real life. As always, the villains fire off vast quantities of ammunition from powerful automatic weapons without ever once finding their target; action heroes and their girlfriends obviously have some miraculous immunity to bullets. Most of those reviewers who have defended this film have pointed out that action-adventure films are not supposed to be realistic. That is a fair enough point, but the main problem with the film is not a lack of realism but rather the lack of a decent plot. The first half, up until the point where Frank discovers who Lai really is, seemed clear enough, but the second half just seemed a confusing series of chase sequences, shoot-outs and martial-arts fights. It is all very well using a mixture of kung-fu skills and CGI techniques to produce a piece of pure escapist entertainment, but I always find that sort of escapism to be more entertaining when it is placed in the context of a plot which, if not strictly realistic, is at least comprehensible. 4/10"

The policeman and the bad guy are friends for no reason I can see. I didn't feel any chemistry in the romance. There is a father-child relationship that doesn't make any sense. The protagonist is one of those criminals with a heart of gold, except in the first 20 minutes of the film, he does some incredibly ugly stuff I won't spoil for you. I can't empathize with a protagonist who'd do that. Some of the comedy with the lead actress fell flat. (You can't miss her, she the only woman in the entire movie with a speaking role.)

","Upon our first meeting, Transporter didn't leave much of an impression as an action film even tough it bore a certain charm & freshness, possibly because I didn't watch it until the end. This is a great actioner ! I'll say it again if I must. It benefits from his Chinese, French and American origins alike : local atmosphere and intimacy combined with one-liners & great action, with martial flavour.<br/><br/>THE GOOD Jason Statham has both the charisma & martial arts skills to make his performance as a self-controlled, slightly weary ex-soldier off. Sold in the making of as the occidental answer to Jackie Chan he is indeed devoted enough to train for his own stunt work up to perfection & very likable. The French police inspector and the Japanese girl are also well portrayed, respectively professional and determined when they're not kind. On the other hand, the villains are cardboard, even tough the henchmen must be given credit for their fighting scenes with Satham. <br/><br/>Supervised by an Asian co-director with years of fighting choreography experience, these are just fine, whether Statham battles with 10 guys in a pool of motor oil (actually syrup but still a slippery mess), outdrives the Marseille police with his Transporter skills or shows near bullet-time speed in an axe fight. Only the fights in the truck cabin kept me wondering why they hadn't crashed already. Vehicles in action movies often seem to have a secretive automatic pilot for these circumstances. <br/><br/>THE BAD Those bank robbers. How can a professional put up with such nerve wrecks ? (I had to say something)<br/><br/>THE UGLY The story (especially the inspector's illegal cooperation in spite of the criminal evidence against the Transporter) isn't everything but less of an excuse than in most B-movies within the genre. The romance has the usual forced start but nevertheless it's highly enjoyable thanks to the innocence of the girl."

","I remember seeing the advertisements for this film. It looked like a good popcorn-flick, plenty of action and not much else. What can I say... accurate ad campaign. That's exactly what this movie is. If that's a good thing or not is up for the viewer to decide, but know that if you go to see this movie, that is what you will get, nothing more, nothing less. The plot just barely makes sense and keeps the movie... well, moving. The pacing is pretty solid. The acting is just about average. The soundtrack consists mostly of hard rock and rap, which is fitting, I suppose. I personally didn't mind(I enjoy both music genres, though I wouldn't exactly say I loved the music in the film), but if you're one of those who would, you might want to consider another film to watch. The cinematography is fairly basic, though some of it is experimentally stylish... and as with most experiments, not all of it is good. Luckily, there's not too much of the bad. The martial arts choreography is pretty good, with some using of surroundings and nearby items in the fights. The action is cool. Very. It's very intense and the film has more than its share of it. Statham may not look like he can kick ass... but believe me, he can. I can't tell you how many fights or action scenes there are in this film; I lost count. One complaint that I simply have to make, though... the girl. She's just about the worst actor in there, she's annoying and every other time she opens her mouth, a screech comes out. I read in her mini-biography that she has a 'manic' acting style; that's OK, there are movies where that fits, where that would be considered good comic relief... but here, it just causes the viewer(maybe not all, but most definitely yours truly) to cringe. The humor in general is pretty tame. Very ""Saturday morning cartoon"". All in all, good if you're looking for a high-octane, leave-your-brains-at-the-door action film. Pointless if you're looking for anything else. I recommend this to fans of action-flicks who can accept that it's nothing but action and still enjoy them. Everyone else, avoid. 7/10"

Still, you could do worse, which I'm sure will be evidenced by my next review on a weekly hired from my video store."

","Hey people I just want to say I did not see part one but I did see part2. Transporter 2 is excellent and definitely worth going to see. I have seen many movies this year ""Million Dollar Baby, The Aviator, Diary of a Mad Black Woman, Kingdom of Heaven, Sahara, and many more. I have to say Transporter 2 was better than any of these movies it's definitely worth seeing. I was truly enthralled, mesmerized and totally taken with the Transporter- he's sexier, and a much better fighter than James Bond even more of a gentleman. What else can I say, go see the movie. I've seen it twice and I'm going to see it again. I will go see Tranporter or try to rent it because the beginning kind of helps to understand why he is what he is but it's not necessary to enjoy part two. Anyway, enjoy the movie. Indya"
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","8","0","0","18 September 2005"," An international action thriller!
","This is a very entertaining piece of action cinema. Jason Statham plays the transporter of the title who (appropriately) transports packages for the highest bidder. Naturally his clients are shady crime world members, after all he is not just a Sunday ride or a trip to the grocery store. The Transporter is a rule abiding, martial arts fighting, pedal to the medal driving professional who knows how to get the job done and get it done right. The story has Frank Martin (Statham) delivering a package to a client cross-country and he unwillingly (well almost) looks into the package, thus breaking one of his strict rules of trade. Then, in short, all hell break loose. Granted that this movie is not much in the plot department, but for action it has few peers. For all of you Hong Kong action film lovers, here is a film produced outside of Hong Kong that follows that same relentless formula you love.<br/><br/>Also, one cannot help but look at the credits: a french director and producer/writer, a British star, a fight choreographer from Hong Kong, a plot involving Chinese criminals, and the hero's car is German. Basically an international action thriller! Also with this movie Jason Statham has cemented himself as leading man and will undoubted do many more action movies in the future, including the sequel to this. 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: violence and action"
"SeminolePhenom","6","0","0","8 September 2005"," The movie thats greatness relies entirely on the fight sequences and chase scenes!
","Frank Martin(Jason Statham)is the greatest driver there is. He makes his own rules and it works out splendid for him until he takes a job transporting a package for a few high class goons. He breaks one his own rules by opening the package only to find a young Asian girl. After bringing the package to its destination he is asked to take another package to a different destination and finds it to be bomb intended to kill him. Frank Martin gets his revenge and starts a battle with very powerful men.<br/><br/>I have found that I enjoy these types of action movies better if they are much shorter as this one is. It is only 92 minutes long which helps keep people entertained throughout. The actual movie consisted of a plot that was OK but was not really carried out well. I happen to be a sucker for the stories of revenge, so I found it quite entertaining. There are many sequences that they try to set a romantic mood to but fail miserably. There is barely any dialog which is the way these types of movies should be. If you are going to make a cheesy action movie then make it rely on the action and only the action!! Don't try to make a dramatic story to the movie! So, The Transporter moved in the right direction by mainly doing this.<br/><br/>As I have already hinted, the action just makes the movie what it is. The fight scenes were some of the best I have ever seen and reminded me of some of the older Jackie Chan movies. The chase scenes were definitely one of the best. I would say the best chase scene since Ronin. Whenever Frank is fighting, you just get a good vibe and it makes the movie. Honestly, if the movie left out the romance and the drama, it would be a great movie. Instead, the movie drags on and on about subjects that don't matter at all making it only mediocre. In conclusion, The Transporter is a entertaining thriller which, like many other action movies, has very many flaws.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie."
"diac228","8","0","0","5 August 2005"," The mindless action film that actually entertains
","Accept The Transporter for what it is and then the rest is just uphill from there. The Transporter is this European film that is exactly the kind of film that I had been looking for: it is no question a truly mindless action flick with a lot of action and also a ton of stunts, and very little plot to weave it in together. Who needs a plot anyway? Despite being a bomb at the United States box office, it gained enough popularity over a small cult following to garnish a sequel. And if there is a movie that deserves a sequel, it should be this one. Not enough people gave Jason Statham a chance years ago, and maybe this time the American public gets to see how good he really is.<br/><br/>This fast-paced film is about a man who gets paid to move stuff around, and he never questions what it is and who it is going to, he is simply used as a transport. Retied mercenary, suddenly Frank Martin grows a heart when his next transfer is actually an Asian female woman. After breaking one of the rules (opening the package) disaster erupts, and now it is up to him to end all the chaos. Yes, the plot sounds a bit on the uncreative end, but guess what, there is only one reason to see this movie, and it is for the action.<br/><br/>The Transporter has more action than most American films out today, and this movie happens to be only 92 minutes long. The movie opens with a massive chase sequence, and the movie ends with a massive chase/action sequence that despite it resembling Raiders of the Lost Ark, it still keeps you on the edge of your seat until the sequence is finished. In between the two big scenes are several more fights here and there that were well choreographed and almost perfectly executed. And unlike most other action movies like The Bourne Supremacy, the action isn't so in-your-face that you have no idea what is going on, the camera is far away enough from the subjects that it allows you to see everything that is happening, and also at times, slows down so you can catch your breath and be able to realize what had just happened. The acting is certainly not Oscar-caliber, but it gets the job done. Jason Statham has plenty of potential in becoming the next big action star, as long as the United States gives him a chance. Remember it took Jackie Chan over a decade before finally coming out with a movie that American audiences went to see, which was Rumble in the Bronx. Oh, before I forget, the soundtrack to the movie was awesome.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: I use Jackie Chan as an example for one reason alone, because Jackie Chan and Jason Statham are both stars of two of among the most underrated and underapprieciated action films in a very long time. Just like Rumble in the Bronx, The Transporter has a weak plot, but is totally made up for with the insane amount of action and kung-fu that makes this film a perfect summer popcorn flick. I personally find this film very entertaining, and get over the fact that it received very little attention and give it a chance, I am sure you will like it. The Transporter: Finally, the mindless action flick that does not try too hard to have a decent plot.<br/><br/>Score: 9/10"

","I watched this movie last night at a friend's birthday get-together, and I had never heard of it before (and hopefully I will forget about it again soon).<br/><br/>**INTERMITTENT SPOILERS AHEAD**<br/><br/>The whole movie is dripping with overused action clichés. So there we have the main character, the ""Transporter"", basically just a slick, high-profile delivery boy in suit and tie who drives a black 7-series BMW. Whatever shady business you're in, he'll handle the driving part, from bank robberies to smuggling people. He also is a retired Marine with quite a past (dind't we see that one too many times? Even Steven Segal is probably tired of playing a character like this by now). He has a strict set of rules while he is doing business, such as ""no names"", ""no questions"", ""no plan alterations"", blah blah blah....<br/><br/>One day he breaks one of his own rules as he opens a big traveling bag he is supposed to deliver - and in it he finds a gagged and handcuffed young beautiful Asian woman. From then on, mayhem arises, people try to kill him, blow up his house with guided missiles and.... oh yeah, the Asian girl falls in love with him and they make out. He soon gets to the bottom of things as he finds out that the girl's father is smuggling illegal Chinese immigrants into the country by the hundreds.<br/><br/>So much for the story, nothing new here, it's all been done before. With Luc Besson as the executive producer of this movie, your expectations are naturally high, especially after masterpieces such as ""The Fifth Element"" or the highly acclaimed ""Leon"". But this time around, Besson is not being his usual ingenious self. Sure, he delivers in putting together a (somewhat sleek) action-rigged spectacular - you'll see explosions, cool weapons, shootouts, martial arts scenes, car chases, flying cars, a dramatic highway chase involving an 18-wheeler and a small airplane etc. But somehow, with this movie, the whole appears to be less than the sum of its parts. Despite their sleekness, many of these parts do look a bit like recycled scenes from your average, cheesy Hollywood action flick, and premise and storyline are ultra-thin.<br/><br/>To get to the point: the movie has lots of (mostly visual) bells and whistles, but it has no soul. If you pick this one up from the video rental, be sure to also get a six pack on the way home.<br/><br/>5.5 out of 10"

","I haven't seen action movie in, literally, years. Sure, I saw adventure/war/thriller/sci-fi movies with action (combat) scenes, but no pure action movie, because I totally lost interest in this genre long time ago. I got this movie from a friend, he just told me, it's the guy from Snatch and if nothing else, it's worth seeing it because of a car chase. So I watched it without expectations, and like with Pirates Of The Caribbean, it worked out very well for me. I'm starting to believe no-expectation policy is the way to go.<br/><br/>Le Transporteur is pure action and that's it. The movie has weak plot, average acting, no character development, but it has energy. The car chase at the beginning is the best I have ever seen. It really rushed adrenaline through my veins. Fighting scenes were also impressive for me, but I really can't compare them to anything as I've usually avoided kick-ass movies since the time of Van Damme. Yes, the movie is totally unrealistic and unbelievable, in real-life main character would die at least ten times (or maybe a hundred times), but that's how it's got to be in this genre nowadays. Actually, that's how it has always been. <br/><br/>Jason Statham, with his black suit, leather gloves and (almost) bald head, reminded me (like another user already wrote) of Hit-man - assassin from a PC game. As a matter of fact, the movie kinda looks like a game. They too lack in story (usually there is none or it's ridiculous), but they look good and are fun, just like this movie. There are complaints about young Shu Qi, but I think she did okay, wouldn't say it was major casting error. I guess they needed oh so cute, fragile, in-need-of-protection type. So what if her English sucks? <br/><br/>But, the movie could be much better. It started really well, with a cool, interesting guy who is real professional. But, when a girl showed up, the movie-makers couldn't resist a little romance, which was unnecessary and really didn't fit in. Bad boys' leader, who is in many movies so charismatic, is here totally empty, shallow, uninteresting. The music wasn't that bad like some say, it was somewhat good, but it really could be better. It's great way to improve the movie with the music, and I really don't understand why they didn't put more effort in it.<br/><br/>I kinda feel bad for the movie, because I did like it. I believe it could be one of the best action movies ever made. Unfortunately, a movie is a whole. Everything counts: acting, directing, script, editing, sound&music. Even action movie needs more than just good action scenes to become really great action movie. Maybe it will improve in sequel, but we all know what's usually the story with sequels, so..."

This film was never intended to be a great classic to go down into film history. The film was purely made to introduce Jason Staham to the action movie audience. Its was nothing more than a test. Anything else he does would, I'm sure, be ten times better and more original. It was produced very quickly so they could advertise his talent quickly. Thats why the story is so simple and the idea is very much a common one. This film was made just to help project Jason into the world of Hollywood action and to be honest he definately deserves it. The stunts were ALL done by himself (apparently he is highly trained in martial arts IRL) and he acts really well too.<br/><br/>Sure the film is definately not original but when you consider what I've told you, you can understand why its such a plainly simple film.

Unashamedly breaking the laws of physics and reality in favour of visual flair (as has always been the Besson way) this movie delivers everything it promises; it is fun, and the story is (whilst not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination) more than adequate as a vehicle for the action.<br/><br/>Strong cast, good story (with no pretensions of being anything it isn't) and beautiful visuals.

"tan_pandit","Null","0","0","6 July 2003"," will have you in transports of mediocrity
","Jason Statham, regular in the cult movies of Guy Ritchie (lock stock... snatch) gets a stab at a lead role in a fairly high profile film. And a fair job he makes of it too. He plays a getaway driver for hire in Europe, and he is a professional who does not ask questions. Until one day he breaks his own rules and takes a look at the package he is supposed to deliver. Fortunately the content is the exquisitely sexy Qi Shu in a mini skirt. The caper evolves in predictable ways with heavy emphasis on the fight scenes - performed by Statham himself. The European setting is fresh, and the actors all do a good job with the mediocre dialogue. It is a formula that works, and this has been reflected in the box office. Be fair to the producers - this is a rather high budget movie for Europe, they need to stick to the formula to ensure a fair return on the investment. It is not some Indie art flick (unfortunately). Be fair to Statham - he is not big enough to heavily influence his characters or the writing, yet does a good job and has earned his right to the lead. Qi Shu, with her over the top style of acting, is rather captivating, and her large experience (and awards) in the Chinese cinema lends an air of steady character to the film. A note on the accents:- Statham is made to adopt what is known in the multimedia world as a 'trans-atlantic' accent, one that is supposed to straddle the English and American accents to be easily understood by Americans, English and European audiences. In this respect it works. Unfortunately it tends to annoy the British, who would rather have one accent or the other. It is more palatable to the US audience who are usually unaware when something has been altered for their benefit. Other nations, it must be said, do not appreciate strong accents or colloquialisms - it is just too hard to understand for non native speakers. So give Statham a break, he was not trying to play an American! In the same vein, Comments from the US that they cannot follow Qi's Chinese accent are unjust. Most people find such accents refreshing and in her case, very endearing. As Statham proves his mettle lets hope he has more say in these kind of things."

","THE TRANSPORTER (2002) possible spoilers((( Jason Statham did a very nice performance in the funky and genius movie Snatch, here he returns as a main character as the Transporter who delivers bags, briefcases and other stuff, illegal that is off course. So one day he is about delivering a package when he notices that inside the bag it lays a woman, Lai. After this, the transporter gets into deep trouble about some human smuggling...<br/><br/>The movie has got some very nice action scenes, as when Statham fights bad-guys in bus etc. but the movie's without weakest point is the actors (not Statham) and much of the other things going on when it is not action. But I was surprised by have good the movie was however, especially all the fine explosions and fighting, though the shooting was a bit pity though. The Transporter is a nice film, not less bad or better then it is. The cover is fabulous - and so is his car, the BMW. Jason Statham does a nice performance and are without doubt going to get more offers to play in films now.

","The plot was pretty weak (and a little confusing), the stunts totally defy real-life physics, and the ending was clichÃ©. So I'm a little reluctant to admit it, but... I loved it! I guess I was just in the mood for an action movie, and this one delivers. Jason Statham (of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch) plays the lead. Who knew he had such a background in martial arts? There are some really innovative fight scenes in The Transporter, many involving props, in the style of Jackie Chan. And fortunately the best ones are kept a surprise and not shown in the trailer. So if that's your kinda thing, I recommend."

","This has to be one of the better action films to come out in recent times, though being a big Jason Statham fan myself I must admit it has brought my opinion of him down a notch or two. The action in this movie is great. Honestly I can't fault it. It's quick, ingenuitive and damn fun. Jason's heroic posturing definately crosses the line and makes it a little ridiculous. The score was very strange, and made some potentially beautiful scenes seem a little embarassing. I was literally blushing in the theatre so it's a good thing theatre's are dark.<br/><br/>The script could have been better by far. Jason is a good actor and I feel like his talents are wasted on this film. He didn't really play the unemotional fighting machine very well (a common problem these days which Lucy Liu is guilty of in Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever). Some of the scenes in this film seem to be irrelevant and could have been replaced with something that fleshes out the plot, rather than having a storyline akin to an 80's action film.<br/><br/>Having said that, I still think it's a great action movie, although it had the potential to be something much more. It's fast, fun and furious. Go rent it."

The movie then turns into a cheesy love story where the couple has to rescue 400 asians that are being illegally shipped into France.

Not so for this flick, the score does not match the movie.

All in all, an unimpressive first viewing.<br/><br/>Then, I found myself thinking ""I'd like to see that first car chase scene again."", Or, ""why didn't i like that fight scene in the bus garage?""... and I ended up buying the movie!!!<br/><br/>The good: This is a straight ahead action flick with good (if not great) fight scenes, a contemporary (if poor) plot, good (if annoying) car-chase scenes.  And Jason.  This man rocks, and I sincerely hope he continues on to super-stardom so we get HIM with some higher-class movies.  Oh, and the settings and scenery are excellent.<br/><br/>The bad:  The girl is an annoying, bad actress who speaks so thickly I found myself wondering what she was trying to project.

","This movie was pretty good, and much better than the previews showed, which consisted etirely of the transpoter kicking various things. For an action movie, it wasn't laughably bad as far as gratuitous fighting scenes, and the concept was pretty cool.<br/><br/>Then, about halfway through the movie, it all went downhill, in my opinion. Every scene is full of endless henchmen trying to kill the  transporter, who had no shirt on and was glistening with fake sweat. This alone drives one away. In addition to that, they throw in some meaningless plot point *5P01L3RZ* about how the bad guys are smuggling in people from Asia! Wow! Few plots have never transitioned so smoothly! All subsequent action sequences were hilarious. Hilariously bad. I can recall vividly a car swerving to a halt on a freeway, to be hit at 70 mph. That was ok. The giant explosion ensuing, however, was a little unrealistic. <br/><br/>In true Raiders of the Lost Ark fashion, he kicks the driver of a tractor trailer out of the side of the truck. The driver then falls, with the door, onto the pavement where he proceeds to actually ACCELERATE, continuing to travel at 70-or-so mph for maybe 15 seconds, and flies off a cliff, the dummy painfully obvious. That's my lasting memory of the movie.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this, though the transporter concept had the potential to be good. If you must rent it, do it for the best lmao action scenes since ""US Seals""."

"bkam","7","0","0","26 June 2003"," Plot holes? Of course, but who cares?
","If you were expecting an involving, strongly emotional film during which you form a relationship with the characters, then how did you end up with this film?  Sure, the characters are flat, and even the plot has some big problems.  Just get your cartoon-sensibilities out and try to enjoy it!<br/><br/>That said, the score is somewhat enjoyable in my opinion, the camerawork is outstanding (if it doesn't bug the hell out of you which it seems to do to some people).  There's not much to be said for any of the actors apart from Jason Statham, who is perfect for the part.  Someone mentioned that he has the Bruce Willis look going on, which is true, while he also has that cool accent.  And those are two guys who can pull off having receding hairlines without going totally skinhead and looking like a slab of meat (like Vin Diesel).  If you liked that look and accent in Snatch or the Italian Job you will probably like it here too.  In my opinion he is a perfect action hero: cool, calm, in control, powerful, fast, and anything but annoying.  Most heroes fail in one of these respects at some point during a film.<br/><br/>So now the important part: the action sequences.  These really make up for the lack of coherence and character development.  Maybe you think that nothing could make up for a lack of coherence; well obviously you're not the action type and should stay away from this film!  If you can get over it, then some of the scenes are quite beautifully done, so rhythmic and well-choreographed as to look like dancing.  Some of the scenes are reminiscent of Kiss of the Dragon (and even one of the villains is the same guy).  That reminds my brothers and I watched it, we were many times reminded of other action movies: Ronin, Speed, Terminator 2, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Lethal Weapon 4, The Professional, the Fast and the Furious (some of these are not surprising due to their mutual associations with Luc Besson).  But while you might just think it copies these other films, it basically does many of the cooler things in these films in a borderline montage of action that leaves you with a sense of tribute to the genre rather than a copycat.  Plus, it has many scenes which are extremely original.  Overall, if you're into the action, this movie has some intense and spectacular scenes.  If you aren't, don't see this movie so we don't have to hear you complain about it. [7/10]"

Jason Statham was really fun to watch and I see him doing well in the future if he avoids doing more movies with completely useless plots that exist only to feature the far-fetched action scenes, like in this movie. (You might say that the same is true of J. Chan films, which I love, but they are at least humorous and extremely entertaining.) The supporting actors for the most part were bad and the storyline was weak. I liked how the movie started by showing us the transporter's job, but then the crap he gets in later is just an excuse for some ridiculous, although often entertaining action scenes. Do not see this movie unless your only expectations are to see ONE watchable actor doing some interesting action scenes. If the story or overall acting matters to you at all, then do not waste your time. This movie had potential with a great star (Jason) and idea for a movie (about a transporter), but did not live up to its potential. 6/10(mostly for Jason)"

It's not entirely credible, but it could happen, and that's saying more than you'd think.<br/><br/>Jason Stathom, whose first films were Guy Richie's ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"", shows that he is a good action star and actually probably better than Vin Diesel.  The script for this flick isn't the greatest and has some wooden dialogue, but the characters are well written and that helps a lot.  The action scenes are thrilling and a lot of fun to watch.  The plot is good for the first half, then worthless for the second half, but then again, the second half is almost pure action.

","Some small SPOILERS<br/><br/>The Transporter is a great action film, with great fight scenes and an okay story. While not a particullary fast film in pace, The Transporter presents a slightly more realistic view of martial arts and unarmed combat. That is where realism stops, but in no way does the movie loose any of its fun or coolness. And cool is what Jason Statham is, plain and simple. He easily fills the role of Frank Martin - The Transporter, who can at one moment be talking to a bunch of lower-level criminals, then dealing with upper crust clients, then kicking the butt of some unfortunate henchman. Statham manages to seamlessly slid between these drastically different facets of his characters being, while remaining extremely calm, collected, and..... well....cool!<br/><br/>While the story is not the greatest out there, and the characters besides Martin rather dull, it is a good story, rather solid and not overly cheesy or overblown. You get the sense the Martin is one man taking on a group with its own little agendas, working for small but important goals. He's not saving NYC from a nuke or taking down a terrorist organization, he's just dealing with a group of thugs, who are small in their goals but in no way disappointing. It is a far more believable film than most action movies, which I appreciate. This story could conceivably take place. Besides a couple plot holes, the story is a good one, not Oscar caliber, but still good.<br/><br/>The action is fast, not from a physical standpoint, but an editing one. While a fight scene is taking place the camera cuts in and out almost too quickly to see all the action, but it does it in just the right way to provide a scene that is charged and gritty. Statham's martial arts skills are great, showing off his training in kickboxing and other martial arts. As an avid karate practitioner, I can say that 99% of his stuff is practical and very little of it is unrealistic. The most impressive fight is the one in which Martin covers himself in oil, preventing the bad guys from grabbing him (which they always do for some strange reason, with painful results). The fight scenes are incredible and highly entertaining.<br/><br/>The one bad thing about this movie is the sound. The slow, light music takes away from the adrenaline and rush of the chases and fights. And the dialouge is often over shadowed by the music. While annoying, they are small grievances.<br/><br/>The Transporter is a solid movie, not great but good. It has a great star, a strong right-and-wrong story, and action that will appeal to any action fan. Not a great piece of cinema, but a strong B-movie that will not disappoint. I highly recommend it!<br/><br/>8/10"

To me, they are not even really the same genre.  But everyone has their own ideas about that... One other point I'd like to make is that it doesn't seem quite fair to judge whether or not Statham has acting ability based on this film. Apart from the stunts, the script doesn't call for him to do much more than occasionally glare menacingly at the camera and look great with his shirt off.  Heck, a lot of us ordinary guys out here could do that (okay, we might have to spend a little more time at the gym first).

","How can an action movie have so little action? The entire movie, except maybe 20 minutes, was all talk. I found this unnecessary, considering the fact that all the talk led to nowhere. That brings me to another factor that ruins the moive. There is a huge lack of plot. The movie seems to move way too fast paced. The chinese girl's acting was absolutely terrible, and whoever played the transporter also had pretty bad acting skills. This movie had several considerable flaws and plot holes. The most annoying part of it is the ending. I was all prepared for a really good action scene and it just stopped. Then I was disappointed. By all costs, avoid this film. Rent The Matrix. Rent Gladiator. Anything but this crap. For those of you who like guns, be prepared for a disappoinment. There were about 2 minutes of guns in the whole film. The rest was talk and some badly coordinated fight scenes. In all, The Transporter deserves nothing more than a 1/10, which is what it received from me."

","God knows I hate to do it, but I have to agree with the critics on this one. Roger Ebert had it right (for once) when he said,""too much action brings the movie to a dead standstill."" It starts off well, but I zoned out about a quarter of the way through and was relieved when it was over.<br/><br/>
While beautifully filmed, as has been said, this movie has little plot coherance and much of the action lacks believability. We are never allowed to know who the characters are or their motivations and frankly, don't care one way or another about them.<br/><br/>Plus, the editing sucks big time. Erratic ""cuts and pastes"" serve to pull the viewer out and add to the distraction. Not to mention the strong accents and lack of english subtitles for some of the dialogue. The only guys speaking clearly haven't much to say. (Don't get me wrong, I speak a couple of languages (asian and european) and have international experience, ""foreigness"" is not an issue. But here it's a major distraction.)<br/><br/>
Even the special features were a disappointment. The extended fight scenes were unedited and we saw the wires.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there is an awesome soundtrack, good humor, beautifiul locations, cool car, generally good fight scenes and Jason Statham without a shirt is nice to look at. The commentaries were rather interesting, especially those of Jason and his point of view as a fighter.<br/><br/>
OVERALL, a B- movie, filmed as if it were an A one."

","The car chase scenes were great. The story shaped up so well and then after the transporter got to the container yard it went shallow with some of the ridiculous fight scenes. It would have worked if there had been more character exploration. You never really knew anyone's story, the deepest we got was that the transporter was X-military.

For some reason though, it never really clicked.<br/><br/>  The background music is bland, and most of the acting is lacking emotion - leaving the viewer very detached.  The chemistry between the actors also seemed forced, with the possible exception of the cop and the transporter. You can't really blame all of them; the Chinese father/daughter spoke broken English like you would expect from a Jet Li movie.<br/><br/>  The strong points were the action, but many of these scenes were overdrawn and too controlled (you'll know what I mean from the final battle in the container yard).<br/><br/>  The plot was very thin, but it took so long to materialize that you might not realize it.

I watch this movies because of the shoot outs and the fighting scenes. And the more spectacular and faster they are, the better the film. If you see a lot of action you will certainly forget about the story. And THIS movie is one of them. The characters talk a little bit but most of the time they shoot, fight or drive very fast through a town. That was it. And it´s fun to watch it.

","Action is in a sad state of self-loathing these days. This is a genre that used to be about macho, adrenaline soaked fun. Now it seems to have been de-revolutionized into a contest to see who can hawk as many recycled ideas into their film. Now anyone who has been subjected to my flow of thoughts in the past will know that I am fully in favour of Luc Besson and his movement to bring integrity to action films that combines the big thrills with the tender art of French theatre. I guess that is why it was such a shame to see a film like this fail horribly at ever turn. This is the story of Frank, a transporter who helped criminals escape the police and also transports packages, no questions asked. He is good at his job, probably the best in the business. He lives by his rules and will die by his rules: number one, never change the deal. Number two, no names, and number three, never look in the package. It is rare to see that an action persona follows such a strict set of guidelines. He asks customers the weight and exact dimensions of their packages and maps out an exact time of deliver, but is a fresh and welcome change to the fold. Who ever said an action man can't be a perfectionist? But rules are meant to be broken, any individual with an active conscience knows that, and when they are broken there is usually little repercussion to accompany the crime. So what should happen if a man who puts his life on the line for his rules decides to break them one sunny afternoon? All hell breaks loose. After having to pull his car over to change a flat tire, Frank finds that the bag in his trunk seems to be alive. So being the gentleman he is, he buys whatever it is a drink. The bag turns out to conceal a young Asian girl who is bound and gagged. Of course with any standard action fare the villains find out about Frank's abundance of disclosed information, making him for death. One of this films major pitfalls is that it makes its central character extremely hard to like and except as someone with heroic traits. Frank is not a good guy nor is he a bad guy. He is a businessman who will do whatever it takes to get the job done and cares only for the payoff he receives from a mission accomplished. Unlike James Bond or Xander Cage for that mater he cares none for the people he deals with and the troubles they face. So when he decides to care for, possibly even love, this Asian girl and risk his life for hers it is hard to give heed to either party. I guess Besson himself is to blame for that, he produced and co-wrote the script to this film. But it is the direction from Corey Yuen that does this film the injustice that it is. Between trying to be as action packed as possible and as artistic as possible Yuen lands right in the centre with nothing with any meaning behind it or any thrills to aid it, to put it bluntly this film is just plain boring. The thing that made Besson's action masterpieces so splendid was that before divulging in action he made sure to have a full cast of characters and a story to back the needs of all supporting to the product. Besson supported his men with anything they needed to bring out the best in their character and in return they delivered him with fully emotive and humanly characteristic people. Here Yuen gives his men very little and they return the favour. Frank seems to walk in and out of action sequences like he has nothing better on his agenda to pertain to and the stories villain(s) are more annoying than threatening. With any Besson film there is a sensual romantic bond between the lead male and lead female. There is no exception here except the fact that it is entirely irrelevant. In one scene they don't care for each other, in the next they make love and in the next they never act upon it again. These feelings are not even made clear to the viewer in the end. The script also feels it priority to through in tremendous plot twists without explanation of given time to be exercised. If there is one pet peeve I have about action it is the whole `trust no one' scenario, especially when the director gives no time to explain of elaborate on any reason for this to be happening. Being as this is an action film there is undoubtedly going to be a mass amount of cliches. I will only touch on two of the worst offenders because I see them in almost ever film of this nature and am getting sick of them. The first one is the `untactful detainment.' This is where a henchman has the hero detained, usually in a headlock, and he still manages to take down all of the oncoming baddies. What is the point of putting a guy in a headlock if he is still able to beat up your men? The second cliche that gives me great discouragement to see is the `vehicular misconduct.' This is when a fight break lose in a vehicle, usually a transport truck, at top speeds on a highway.  You all know what I am talking about that scene where the two rivals try to fight and steer at the same time and one usually finds themselves hanging out of an open door or kicked out a windshield. This is one of the most recycled action sequences out there and trust me, it does not get better with time. I do not know who scored this film but whoever it was should maybe consider resigning from the action field and entering into low-grade porn. That's right there is porno music playing during one of the film's more intense action sequences, not only ruining the momentum and structure of the scene but also sacrificing any enjoyment from the scene. This is a very kaleidoscopic film. It is a wide array of shifting fragments and colours to come up with something new around every turn. It is truly a film of great potential with the talent, on and off screen to make for a great action/art film in the same vein as La Femme Nikita but falls flat on its face from what I like to call `XXX syndrome.' Meaning it features enough action to deliver the thrills but has such a mish-mash of a story that it is almost made impossible to like, and in this day and age of low rent film making, story is key."

","Looking like a Brit version of Bruce Willis, Jason Statham made his debut back in Guy Ritchie's classic crime caper/comedy ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.""  Since then he has been given a few side roles here and there in ""Snatch"" (or Lock, Stock 2 as I like to call it), John Carpenter's ""Ghosts of Mars"", and then he teamed up with Delroy Lindo to track two Jet Li's in ""The One.""  But who would've guessed that he finally got his own film, and a kick ass action film at that.  Ever since Corey Yuen and Luc Besson collaborated on ""Kiss of the Dragon,"" I knew that any film they did together from then on would be golden. And ""The Transporter"" definitely lives up to that standard. Sure there's nothing new here: how many times is a bad guy gonna get a change of conscience over a hot chick, right? And unlike the others, there is actually some good chemistry going on between our hero and his damsel in distress.  <br/><br/>Basically, the film combines some great European atmosphere (The beautiful southern coast of France) with some incredible fight and action sequences. Corey Yuen could pretty much create a fight scenario out of virtually any environment. Now I know you could easily replace Staham with Jet Li, but you know what? He really proves that he can hang with the big boys in this film. I mean, he did ALL HIS OWN STUNTS. How awesome is that? Not even our great American action actors like Sylvestor and Arnold can say that. My only criticsim of the film is that I think they should of beefed it up a little bit and went for the R rating. Other than that I think it's a great little action/martial arts movie with a European flavor. It will definitely make you reminisce over the days when Van Damme and Seagal used to make great Action fliks. I can't wait to see what Turkish has in store for us next.

Unfortunately after he finds the girl the movie breaks down into a series of cliches and explosions that are less interesting. The girl in particular, Qi Shu, is not a terribly good actress and is better as eye candy than whenever she speaks. In fairness it's probably her first English language movie.

","There is a particular sub-type of film character perfect for those with thinning hair and vocal chords like truck engines, and we have seen a lot of his type lately. I speak of the shaven-headed hard man. Yul Brynner was an early example, stomping around Westworld looking hairless and deadly. Bruce Willis made the type famous, Vin Diesel is busy attempting to do the same again. But from the late nineteen-nineties there was another waiting in the wings, with a can of shaving foam in one hand and a can of whup-ass in the other. Jason Stratham. <br/><br/>Those in the know have watched his progress in reverent silence, as stargazers might a passing meteor- here was one who, quite apart from romancing Kelly Brook, had a glittering Hollywood future ahead of him.<br/><br/>
Sadly, this film represents (at the very least) a worrying misstep. This ex-diver is out of the water and struggling.<br/><br/>Let us begin as the film does, with a chase. There is no impression of speed, only a little fluff for the cinematographer's showreel and some rather limp comedy. Jason Stratham attempts cool (he's done it before, successfully) but ends up resembling Christopher Reeve post-accident, or a person playing 'dead lions'. Soon there are other action scenes, and a romantic subplot that I cannot muster the energy to describe, and a fight in oil- entertaining in its avowed non-naturalism, and a refreshing change from staring contests and pointless explosions. I felt a deep and crippling sense of ennui, and left with no memories of the film apart from fond ones of the hero's gloss-black executive car. <br/><br/>Avoid this film! Not an abominable ninety minutes, admittedly, but such a waste. You could have made a model aeroplane in the time it took to watch this; you could have written a letter to an old friend. Do either of those two things instead of watch this film. Do something else, if you like. I can't pretend to know about your interests."

","Spoilers Herein.<br/><br/>I didn't expect much from this movie before going into it since I read some of the comments about this movie. I did hear that it still had some style that made it stand out so I decided to check it out. The plot is paper thin. It's something about 400 Chinese in a container being imported from Asia. Our hero Frank Martin (good combination of two first names, not) gets involved in this matter when he breaks one of his own rules and opens a package (the heroine Lai Kwai) that he is delivering. This is very unprofessional of him seeing as how the first scene in the movie tries to establish him as someone who doesn't fool around and gets the job done. It's hard to believe he goes 'soft' since he isn't prone to killing people.<br/><br/>I don't have enough negative comments about the actress Qi Shu who played Lai Kwai. I think there are enough talented Chinese actresses around to have to resort to someone who doesn't speak English well. Then there is the French police officer who's accent makes it hard to comprehend him, although I probably shouldn't be complaining. Okay so you have British, French, and Chinese people all speaking English. How about some Americans?! Given that British people invented the language, I won't say anything about that.<br/><br/>This movie tried to combine too many things into one. Cool cars? I liked the BMW and Mercedes, but this should probably be left up to Bond. Martial arts? Jackie Chan is your man. Muscle fighting? Did I hear someone say Arnie? Espionage? How about Ethan Hunt? The combination of such disparate elements doesn't fare too well in this movie. I suppose you could say this is second-rate material of the above mentioned established actors/characters.<br/><br/>Frank Martin is an unbalanced character. He seems almost rigid and mechanical at times. He doesn't show much emotion but Lai Kwai takes to him right away. Does he have class? As I mentioned earlier, he's no Bond, but at times he can hold his own. His character reminds me of the bald character in Hitman (a game for PC). We don't learn much about his past except that he used to be a soldier.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, although not great, was not bad. I liked the mix of hip-hop, techno, and rock music throughout the film. The editing does not help complement the background music.<br/><br/>So what's the final verdict? The story sucks. The action is second-rate and needs lots of polishing. The acting is horrible by most of the actors. I would say since it's hard to come by really good action films, this would probably be an average action film better than some, but by no means good. I would recommend people to stay away from this, or at least view with caution."

I wasn't the least disappointed when I came back home. This was actually one of the best pure action movies I've seen in months. xXx was good, but perhaps a bit too much. The Transporter was all that xXx wasn't, though the stories are not to be compared, but some of the scenes was a bit alike. Anyway, The Transporter can be proud of the good acting, fabulous fighting scenes and a great and innovative story. Another thing that surprised me was the fact the whole love deal in the movie wasn't bad at all. Often the romance and love parts in action movies sucks.. really bad too.<br/><br/>So to sum it all up. If you're looking for a nice fighting-speed-action flick, then this is really it. I still have to warn you. If you get disturbed on things that aren't ""realistic"" then you better leave this movie alone. Actually, then you should leave all action movies alone, because they are all about being ""a bit too much"". Now that I have warned you.. go see it. Don't hesitate!<br/><br/>It will rock you so bad that you will need a respirator to breath!"

They gave the lead actor this ghey american accent, its AWFUL.<br/><br/> Its a real shame, as originally the role called for a ex-SAS freelancer, why they just couldn't leave it like that who knows? Maybe its to do with the fact it's a French production and they couldn't stand the idea of a strong British actor in a lead role in a French film...?<br/><br/> Anyway, apart from that it's very very good. Funny as fewk, its so true to life, how extremely violent situations can lead to bizarre yet hilarious conclusions (i have some personal experience of that.) The action sequences are some of the best I've seen, esp the oil and axe scenes,leading me to suspect that Stratham may be in the line-up as the next Bond.<br/><br/> However, both the lead protagonist and the female leads father are cardboard cut-out stereotypes, a little more time should have gone into casting them methinks....<br/><br/> All in all a great night out or to you dvdr types a great night IN ;-)<br/><br/> I thoroughly recommend this film; expect laughs, gasps and phews as 'Frank' takes us on the 'ride' of our lives!"

He plays the tough guy well, and I really hope to see this British hunk in more leading roles.<br/><br/>His martial arts are actually VERY good. He performs nice fast snap kicks, and seems to be a pretty high jumper. The problem? Well the biggest problem with the martial arts in this movie is that you can pretty much see each opponent waiting for the kick or punch from Statham - which makes the martial arts in this look weak.<br/><br/>The best fight scenes in this are:<br/><br/>-The whole Bus sequence<br/><br/>-The whole oil wrestling scene<br/><br/>-Statham knocking down the door, and taking on the guys with axes.<br/><br/>

","I had heard nothing good about this film, but as I started to like Jason Statham in Jet Li's 'The One', I thought I would see his headlining performance in 'The Transporter' when it came to the UK.<br/><br/>I had already heard that the director was only interested in stunts and that Statham's accent drifted from faux-American back to archetypical Mockney. I had already read that there was no plot to speak off and that the whole enterprise was unrealistic.<br/><br/>Having seen the film and been flabbergasted by its stylishness, I don't think these valid criticisms touch the film.<br/><br/>Jason Statham is the Man. Tough, composed, laconic and absolutely ready and willing to take on any number of hostiles. How can he be so good at this kind of martial mayhem? How can he be so flexible? I have seen generations of genuine martial artists take to the cinema - Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Olivier Gruner, Cynthia Rothrock, Don 'The Dragon' Wilson - but on the basis of 'The Transporter' these have nothing on Jason.<br/><br/>There are enough stylish and imaginative stunts to make me think this film is at least on a par with the best James Bond films.<br/><br/>Other attractive features are the beautiful vistas from Southern France, the well-placed musical tracks, the villains who are 'well 'ard' and 'serious'.<br/><br/>I don't know how an obscure British actor gets to star in a film that opened at cinemas in the USA and didn't go straight to video in the UK.

Statham was excellent (unlike his performance in The One) and the chemistry between him and Shu Qi's character (I always knew her as Hsu Chi) was both amusing and heart warming when appropriate.<br/><br/>The action scenes were fantastic, Statham carried them very well and the editing was not too noticeable.

There were countless times when myself and other people in the cinema cracked up (check out the moment when the flowing music kicks in when Statham opens the bag for the first time!) at moments which were quite frankly halarious!

","Good grief, what a wretched movie.  The first scene, though a touch over-the-top, was pretty good with the car escape from the bank job.  And that was it.  The movie then deteriorated into a kind of pretentious version of 70's/80's martial arts film.  The improved film quality and more expansive cinematography only made the action sequences seem more goofy. At least with the old kung fu movies you knew what to expect: low quality filming with silent film era special effects, but with blazing fight sequences.  Transporter was a joke....the british actor seemed slow and awkward by comparison, his opponents politely positioning themselves to take their licks.  I confess, I got sucked in by Luc Besson's name....I initially thought he directed it.  What the hell is happening to him??!  After Fifth Element, he kind of lost it.  Messenger seemed to signify some kind of psychotic break, and now writing credits for this?!  Not good.  I may skip his next endeavour and put him on rental probation.  Frankly, I felt embarrassed for those who gave Transporter good marks....I think I remember an exclamation of ""Excellent!"" within a couple posts.  I'm at a loss....how does one perceive in such a way?  Anyway, each to his own.  If anyone wants to get the most out of this film, buy a ticket to some other movie starting 15 minutes later and then sneak into Tranporter and watch the initial car chase...then go see the better movie.

","On the heels of `XXX' and `Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever' comes `The Transporter', another movie that dedicates itself to non-stop action without care for much of anything else.  Jason Statham plays Frank Martin, AKA The Transporter. He is a courier, moving packages for seedy gangsters. He lives in a waterside home and drives a sleek BMW that would make James Bond jealous. The Transporter operates by three rules: deals cannot be changed, there are no names to be used and to never look in the package.<br/><br/>
During one of his jobs Martin breaks his third rule and opens the package, which has been thumping in his trunk for most of his drive. The cargo is actually a beautiful woman, (Qi Shi), and Martin is immediately attracted to her. But business is business, and he delivers her to the destination. After the delivery, the head thug (Matt Schulze) offers Martin another job, which he accepts. The package is a bomb, destroying the BMW, sending the very lucky Martin on a mission for revenge.<br/><br/>This is an action film, top to bottom. The opening car chase and some hand-to-hand fights are impressive, but unfortunately that's about it. The villains can't compete with Frank Martin, so therefore nobody cares about the plot, the supporting characters are one-dimensional and they all blurt out horrible lines of dialogue. The blame goes to writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, who thought that only the explosions and karate chops would carry this movie. Action movies can have a brain, and last summer's `Bourne Identity' proved that.<br/><br/>Even with all of the film's problems, Jason Statham is excellent in the title role. An alumni of Guy Ritchie's ensemble casts in the British gangster films `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and `Snatch', Statham proves he has the presence to steal the lead from Vin Diesel as the next big action star. Hopefully he'll be in some better movies, and turn out to be the next Bruce Willis rather than the next Jean-Claude Van Damme.<br/><br/>

The story of the transporter is pretty simple; jason statham play's a guy who delivers packages for criminals. He has simple rules that shouldn't be broken, not by the criminals who give him the assignment or himself.<br/><br/>Then he brakes the rule himself, he opens a package. and in that package he finds a chinese girl. from that moment there after the criminals who are smuggling people in containers from asia to france.<br/><br/>this film has disappointed me a bit. When you know the luc besson movies, you expect something fast. this movie is fast but only in the first half after that it's turning into a soft story about trust and real love. So my conclusion is that if you like films from Luc Besson you shouldn't watch this, because it's a little disappointing. if you are a fan of Luc Besson you probably gone watch it any way.<br/><br/>I give this film a 6. greetings to all of you movie lover's"

The first impression I got as the movie played out was that this was a big screen adaptation of the popular video game ""Driver"".  But as the story played out, it became painfully obvious that it was just another effort to follow the Hollywood pattern. Good things:  The actors fit pretty well, and many stunts have a Jackie Chan quality.  Jason Stathom makes a great leading man.  There are tons of current, hip camera shots and editing tricks to make this look cool. Bad things:  The bad guy looks like a character from the Kids in the Hall (I thought immediately of the bad guy from Brain Candy when I saw him).  The story seems to have been pieced together from a 14 year old who's already seen too many Bond films and played way too many video games.  Also, during the fights, there are tons of ""lame fighters"".

I told Jessika it was lucky that Miss Asia was a certified diver. <br/><br/>We were 40 minutes into the movie, and Jessika turns to me and says, ""You know, we still haven't figured out what the hell this is about.""<br/><br/>Soon, another guy shows up in the film, wearing so much pancake makeup that I told Jessika he looked like Little Richard.<br/><br/>When you do realize the plot, though, it's so wildly implausible that I was asking Jessika. ""OK, so the hero's trying to stop people from smuggling illegal Asian slaves in the back of MACK trucks through the French Riviera? Where are they going? Who keeps Asian slaves in Europe? I thought Asia was the only place where they could employ Asians under deplorable conditions at a slave wage.""<br/><br/>(Later, I mentioned to Jessika that the scene where Miss Asia frees the slaves reminded me of the time when Catherine Zeta-Jones saved Mexico single-handedly in THE MASK OF ZORRO.)<br/><br/>At one point, during one of the hero's slow-motion, shirtless running scenes, I pretended to be running with him. And Jessika howled.<br/><br/>""No, it gets more gay!"" Jessika said to me. ""Soon, he's going to be covered in oil!""<br/><br/>It did. At one point, the hero, shirtless and doused in barrels of oil, deeply kisses a dead man underwater - to stay alive. (Yeah right.) I almost fell on the floor I was laughing so hard.<br/><br/>This reminds me, where can I hire myself an evil henchman? You know, someone who only exists to run at my more heroic enemies only to get killed?<br/><br/>
And the ending, when Miss Asia frees the slaves (while I was wondering why they weren't all sick from being stuck in the back of a truck during an elaborate, multi-accident chase scene), also has her deliver what must be the worst line in the history of film. <br/><br/>Jessika and I laughed so hard that we both cried. We're going to gather a group of people to see it again later this week. I suggest you do the same."

","I think many critics went to this film expecting something totally different then what this film was trying to be. Critics were actually looking for a quality detailed plot and Oscar winning performances. I can tell you right now that the Director: Luc Besson wasn't even aiming in that direction at all. The actual plot of this movie was definitely an afterthought. I'm not going to bother going into full detail of the plot either, cause everyone who has seen this movie knows what it's about. I want to comment more so on the performance of Jason Statham. Can this former unknown carry an action movie and could he be the next Arnold, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Bruce Willis or even Vin Diesel? Well..I don't think he's any of them, as he has his own style, but I think he has the potential to be a great action star. While all the other actors are great action stars, most of them can barely act. Vin & Bruce had their moments (Pitch Black & The Sixth Sense), but the others are pure action actors with one line dialogues. I think Jason Statham has charisma, style, personality, wit and the look. He has a unique way of delivering his lines. He does it with coolness and confidence. In the Transporter he does this adamantly and his fighting abilities are pretty awesome as well. People forget that he was in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch and even The One w/Jet Li. He'll be in The Italian Job next.<br/><br/>
As for the movie itself, I loved it. I went into the theater expecting continuous action with a small plot to move the story along and that's what I got. I was happy that the producers didn't show ALL of the action scenes in the trailer like many of them like to do. There was still a lot of special effects and stunts that weren't in the trailer. If your bored and need a little excitement in your life get to the theater and see The Transporter. If you want to see an even better action film get Jet Li's FIST OF LEGEND.

","The Transporter is like a Jackie Chan movie without Jackie and without humour.  The story is one dimensional and oh so predictable.  A 12 year old who plays an excessive amount of first person shooter could have come up with a better plot.  Now I can appreciate a good ol' fashion action movie, but this was way over the top.  I was all over that opening car chase scene until he jumped his BMW off a bridge and onto a transport truck,...come on let's keep it within the realm of reality.  See Frankenheimer's Ronin for a proper car chase scene.  And what about parachuting down onto the trucks, once again why couldn't he have just driven up to the trucks and hopped on...that I could go for.  And the rockets into the house....anyways, I love action flicks, but I also like a sense of reality, even if the movie just skirts it.  The Bond flicks are a good example of extreme action within the confines (for the most part) of the physical laws of the universe.  As for the acting, over the top, but that's to be expected.  Character development...non existent.  Love interest...laughable.  However, the most disappointing aspect of this film was the blatent plagerism of Guy Ritchie's BMW ""Ambush"" short and Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".  If you see the movie it's obvious.

","Some spoilers included.<br/><br/>The Transporter had these brief moments where you thought to yourself, ""Well, it isn't going to be any kind of intelligent movie, but at least it will be passibly entertaining."" Then the movie would wander from averagely dull to amazingly s**tty.<br/><br/>The Transporter didn't have any ""big name stars"" and that was a plus... as watching Keanu Reeves or Tom Cruise ""act"" their way through the film would have been torture. With more of an unknown in the lead (Jason Statham who has starred in Snatch, Ghosts of Mars and The One) you wind up hoping for the best: that the actor will tap into some hidden pool of talent and really deliver in the performance. This never really takes place. Statham looks cool enough shooting and kicking people, but this will only take you so far. While the plot at first seems to be trying something interesting, before long it becomes obvious that the writer just watched a bunch of other action films over the last five years and cut and pasted them together to make his movie. Again, this wouldn't be a problem if the film wasn't so bad in places. There is a difference between going to see something very clever and going to see something fun. Your hopes for ""clever movie"" vanish within a few minutes, but it takes about twenty for you to realize that you're not even going to get fun.<br/><br/>The film begins copying the Saint, with Statham playing the role of disillusioned military guy Frank Martin who has gone to work as a transporter of goods. Any kind of goods. The gimmick is that Statham doesn't ask questions about the cargo, and as long as you (a) pay the fee and (b) give precise instructions you're good to go. Statham has three rules, first ""don't change the deal"". Second, ""no names"". Third, ""never look at/in the cargo"". So of course, the movie follows the plotline of establishing that Statham is great at what he does and that makes him a cold and unemotional person, until he breaks all of his rules and becomes a nice guy concerned with saving the world.<br/><br/>Like most good action films, all it takes is a nice ass to get our hero to renounce his evil ways and become a decent guy. The shift is pretty abrupt too, as not less than ten minutes earlier in the film we see Statham happily killing two policemen and stuffing them in the truck. The plotline of ""killer with the heart of gold turned to the good side of the force thanks to a nice ass"" has been used several thousand times in the past, and it's no more interesting here. In The Transporter the role of the nice ass is played by Qi Shu, who has been in a ton of international films. She's no better because of it. In her role, she gets to play wary captured victim turned happy housewife turned sex starved slut turned cold missionary for the people to helpless victim to daddy's girl to daddy's murderer. It's as logical a transformation as you can imagine.<br/><br/>There are several plot holes in the film... but does anyone really care? In a film like this you are often willing to overlook gaping plot holes in favor of just having a good time. When the good time doesn't deliver, you're left wondering what exactly you did get out of the movie. To help, here's a quick list:<br/><br/>1. François Berléand is decent in his role as the slightly suspecting police chief. One has memories of Pink Panther films, and at this stage in the film you're begging for any kind of relief... comedy or otherwise.<br/><br/>2. The opening car chase scene is almost fun. Of course, my BMW doesn't drive like that and never, ever will.<br/><br/>3. Unintentional comedy spots throughout the movie; the BMW is a super car that drives pel mel through the city and at one point leaps onto a semi-truck carrying other cars... but later in the film it gets a flat tire for no apparent reason. The guy has an amazing house and is very paranoid, but apparently didn't bother to invest in a security system. And on it goes...<br/><br/>4. The director tries to make fight scenes innovative, but has no real concept of what is interesting and what is goofy. The height of this comes as Statham beats up eight bad guys in a bus station by pouring oil all over them and the floor, and then putting bicycle foot pedals on his own feet so he alone can stand and fight.<br/><br/>The Transporter isn't a good movie. It isn't Blair Witch 2 bad, but it isn't good. When you finally get the full picture of what our hero is fighting against, and it turns out to be a couple hundred people sold into the slave trade who are stored in cargo bins... well, it's just hard to get excited about it. Over in Mission Impossible 2 they are giving you death viruses. In the James Bond films the bad guy is trying to blow up the world. In this one we get a group of people stuffed in the back of a semi-truck with their luggage. It looks more like an Saturday night on the Mexico border than any kind of evil plot.<br/><br/>Yeah, the movie has action. But it's often too goofy to really care about. Yeah, the movie has music, but going from classical to techno pop as the car races around the city isn't a charming mix. Yeah, the girl has a nice body... but it's hard to care when the acting is so god-awful. Which really sums up the whole film:<br/><br/>Hard to care."

","For me Francois Berleand was the star of this movie as the worldlywise French cop who knows exactly who the Transporter is and what he does, but he approaches his job like a chess game where he's always a few moves ahead of his opponent.  Like the great Jean Gabin in those wonderful old black and white flicks, Berleand speaks volumes with a shrug, a glance,  a half smile or (of course) a puff of the de rigueur cigarette, without which it's impossible to be properly Gallic and suave.  Mr. Statham, for his part, seemed most engaged in the proceedings during his verbal rope-a-dope with Mr. Berleand.<br/><br/>I have liked Mr. Statham a lot not just in those English gangster movies but in ""The One"" with Jet Li and John Carpenter's ""Ghosts of Mars,"" he deserves to be a star in his own right and this movie co-starring a vehicle should have been the right vehicle for him.  It's a shame he was given so little to do, aside from kicking the crap out of many people, which he does quite handily.  There's a lot of talk about ""rules"" in this movie and the movie itself obeys the rules of martial arts onscreen, one being that when the hero is facing a bunch of bad guys, they're only allowed to attack him one or two at a time, and they're not allowed to have guns unless they stand so close that the hero can disarm them.  Jacie Chan's classic shtick of picking up any handy item to use as a weapon is alive and well here, likewise Chan's trademark element of farce/slapstick, e.g. the oil-slick brouhaha.  And we have death-defying stunts galore and tire-squealing car chases and all sorts of goings -on.     Yet somehow Mr. Statham himself seems to get lost in the proceedings.<br/><br/>It's really not his fault.  His character is very sketchily written, the plot seems to have been made up as they went along a la ""Casablanca,""  and the desired chemistry between him and the Chinese heroine just doesn't happen.  I don't know who the actress is or what she did previously, and she's, you know, cute and all that, but she just did nothing for me whatsoever, and apparently not much for Mr. Statham either.  She's no Bai Ling, let's say, much less a Lucy Liu or Kelly Hu or--dare I mention the name--Michelle Yeoh aka Michelle Kwan.  She's a cypher and even the writers seem to have grasped that; look how long they keep her bound and gagged onscreen to try to generate some fetishistic interest in what's happening with her.  ""The Big Hit,"" another movie with a kidnapped Chinese chick falling for the kidnapper, only took about five minutes to generate the romantic oomph that his one never really achieves.  The movie doesn't even bother including the usually obligatory closing shot of the of the hero & heroine alone together, as though acknowledging they were never really an item.<br/><br/>As we knew in advance from the trailer, there's a scene where the bad guys approach Statham's house to kill him and choose to deviate from the French tradition of subtlety by firing a rocket launcher at the place.  The scene goes on so long it becomes funny, but stupid-funny not clever-funny.  One would think the bad guys at least would have made sure Statham was even home before unleashing more firepower than, I think, the French army used at Dienbenphu.  They seemed to know in advance they would be undisturbed by the arrival of police during their assault; maybe they'd read the script, assuming there was one.  But it did afford the French cop one of the best lines in the movie, when he drily asked if Statham would care to account for the thousands of rounds of spent ammo surrounding the remains of his house. ""Maybe they had the wrong house....""   Good one, Centurion!<br/><br/>Bottom line, I did enjoy this but not as much as I was hoping I would.  If they do a sequel, maybe Mr. Besson himself will take charge next time & give us another cult classic like ""La Femme Nikita"" or ""The Professional"" ...."
"Xeo","Null","0","0","14 October 2002"," A review of The Transporter. The most satisfying action movie in a long time.
","The Transporter is an action flick that doesn't pretend to be anything else. It also happens to be one of the most satisfying movies I have seen in a long time.  The movie starts off slowly, with Frank Martin, The Transporter, played by Jason Statham, sitting calmly in his car waiting.  The entire first part of the story is designed to set up who he is and what he does. The Transporter is a man who will take anything wherever it needs to go for a price.  In the opening sequence he transports a group of thieves from the location they have just robbed to a designated meeting point.  As he does so, we learn a little about his way of doing business (no nonsense) and get treated to one of the best car chase scenes the big screen has seen in a long time. The Transporter is obviously very good at what he does and Statham portrays him marvelously.  He doesn't come off as an Arnold type super hero, willing to kill anything.  He remains cool, but not glacial as surprises pop up. He tries to avoid fights in most of the movie, only kicking ass when he has to. Statham's performance was one of the big parts of the movie I really enjoyed.  Martin is obviously supposed to be a typical action star character, involved in high-speed car chases and running away from expanding fireballs, but he still manages to come off as human.  The fact that Statham is a really good actor (as demonstrated in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch) is a big part of what made the movie above average.<br/><br/>The other really great part of this movie is the departure from the usual `hero meets pretty girl, falls in love and agrees to help her defeat bad guys' storyline.  It takes the better part of the movie for the female lead (Qi Shu) to convince him to help, and when she does it's only in part because he's going to be stuck in jail if he doesn't.  There is no final showdown with the big boss in a burning building, or prolonged kung fu battle and despite some of the seeming absurdities and a couple of Deus Ex Machina scenes, the story is completely believable in the world it sets itself up in.  Every part fits in well to the story and doesn't leave and blatant plot holes. The acting and basic plot alone would not be enough to make the movie truly enjoyable without the action and the liberal application of humor.  The movie is quite obviously an action movie.  If you hadn't figured it out from the advertisements and posters, it becomes blatant in the first 10 minutes. The advertisements promise car chases, fight scenes and explosions and the movie certainly delivers.  Apart from the usual action fare is a really entertaining fight involving a lot of oil, a high-speed chase in an 18-wheeler and a hijacked crop duster.  The originality keeps the audience from tuning out parts of the action as being simply rehashed from another movie.  My favorite part about this movie though is that it's really pretty funny.  It's not really a comedy, but there are a lot of little humorous movements spread throughout the story that keeps the audience awake and alert. I went into this movie expecting the usual formulaic action movie, and came out more satisfied than I had for any other movie I've seen in a long time. The action was amazing, the humor was subtle, and the story was head and shoulders above most of the action movies out there."

This is one of the few action movies I've ever wanted to see novelized, because I can't help thinking there were some untold stories floating around (in Statham's mind, if not producer Besson's) which might've added a little depth to an otherwise shallow movie."

Facts don't get in the way of a good story, and in a good story such lapses can be easily forgiven. This is sadly not one of those films, though.  I can only presume that the budget ran out, and deadlines did their damage, because after what seemed promising through almost the entire movie quickly turned into a shambles with one of the weakest endings I have ever seen.  I won't spoil what happens, although the ending could hardly be any more spoiled if I tried - suffice to say that you will leave the cinema thoroughly disappointed, and perhaps even tempted to try for a refund.<br/><br/>As the film progressed, I'd been expecting to want to buy it on DVD if only for some funny scenes, alongside its impressive special effects and fight scenes (which borrow heavily from the movies of Jackie Chan in places).  As I left the cinema, though, it was with the knowledge that even if I received this film on DVD free, I'd sell it to get something better with the money. That would not be a difficult proposition."

","Let's be honest here.  The appeal of The Transporter is not in a gripping, tightly-plotted script that speaks to the intricacies of human nature.  The appeal of The Transporter is in the action.  The appeal is the highly-choreographed, Hong Kong-inspired, thrill-a-minute martial arts and stunts that make movies like this great fun.<br/><br/>Directed by Hong Kong veteran Corey Yuen (Jet Li's Fong Sai Yuk movies) and coscripted by French action master Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita, Leon, The Fifth Element), The Transporter is the story of Frank (Jason Statham), an ex-military man who now earns a lucrative living in France as a transporter; a man who drives criminals and delivers packages, no questions asked.  Frank has three rules:  Number one, never change the deal.  Number two, no names. And number three, never open the package.<br/><br/>Well it wouldn't be much of a movie if Frank didn't break the rules - and it's rule number three that proves his downfall, as he opens the package in his trunk only to find the lovely Lai (Shu Qi).  This starts a chain of action sequences that lead to a very cloudy and obscure plot which serves mostly to offer up more bad guys for Statham to beat the living snot out of.<br/><br/>And beat them up he does. The action sequences are the saving grace here, with boundless energy (and an endless supply of goons) and inventive setpieces.  The movie starts with a high-energy chase scene down alleyways, up stairs, and every which way but the right way on one-way avenues. Another top-notch scene involves an outnumbered Statham fighting off a barrage of mooks while all of them have to deal with overturned barrels of oil - there's more slipping and sliding than there is punching and kicking there.  It all adds up to a lot of fun.<br/><br/>There's no depth and mystery involved in a picture like The Transporter.  It is what it is, and it aims to please.  For pure entertainment (and a few double-take moments), it's well worth the time spent."

","There are two types of bad action movies: the first is the action movie that doesn't even bother to put in a storyline, and simply tries to get by with some cool gimmicks and action sequences; the second is the action movie that tries to put in a story line to make it seem like a movie with substance...and fail miserably. This movie didn't just fail miserably. It failed with such spectacular flare that practically two-thirds of the people in the theatre, including myself, burst out into laughter and just about every scene. If you're looking for some mindless action, I suppose this movie may do, although even the action sequences (supposed highlights) are way too unrealistic (pretty much an attempt to create the White Bruce Lee, if you ask me). But I'd recommend a DVD rental, not a waste of your saturday night (a mistake that I don't regret; I hadn't laughed as much in quite some time. The Unintentional Comedy Value in this movie is phenomenal; it rivals the likes of Mortal Kombat)."

","A great action flick that doesn't go over the top with the fight scenes, like so many do lately, or use a cliche'd ending. It looks like there is a little wire work but it's not obvious (like the six kicks in the air stuff). The chase scenes are good but tiring (why does EVERY action flick have to have a chase in it?), and Statham's character is interesting and fun to watch. They added tracers to all the bullets, which added to the visuals of the shooting scenes.<br/><br/>The amicable relationship he has with the French inspector is a nice touch. It added comic relief without getting silly.<br/><br/>*** SPOILER *** I really appreciated the fact that the movie avoided a cliche' twist ending, like the love interest betrayal or buddy betrayal. I was expecting it, but it didn't happen. Also, the love scene seemed a little contrived at first, but then I realized she seduced him to get him to follow her later. So that made sense. *** SPOILER OFF ***<br/><br/>My only real quibble is one of the fight scenes went on a little too long and after a while it didn't make sense. It reminded me of Hong Kong kung fu movies where they have to slip a fight scene into the movie at every opportunity. Statham had to rush to save the good guys and beat the bad guys, but he decided to beat people up and leave them alive instead of finding a gun and shooting them. Oh well."

It follows a professional courier of illegal goods who breaks the first rule of transportation: never open the package. Fortunatley, the package he opens contains a beautiful kidnappee. Unfortuantley for him, he now has the police, his clients, and others on his tail. Jason Statham is amazing-despite the obvious exaggerations that come with all action films- and Qi Shu is incredibly tasty.

"Nigel St. Buggering","6","0","0","13 October 2002"," Great action; where's the story?
","Everyone involved with this film has gone above and beyond their minimal duties in crafting an action film, save one; sadly, he is the lynch-pin of the entire production.<br/><br/>First, the good: Jason Statham is in serious competition with Vin Diesel as THE cool action hero of the post-Arnold age.  He has incredible screen presence, he can handle the action, and he can actually act.  He also has a great regular-guy feel to him that reminds one of Bruce Willis when ""Die Hard"" hit the screens.  Director Corey Yuen does a terrific job of creating a western approach to the Hong Kong action film; the action sequences are uniformly exciting and interesting, even when they're being thoroughly ridiculous, a hallmark of Hong Kong cinema.  The supporting cast all do their jobs admirably, namely making the hero look good.<br/><br/>So the problem?  Luc Besson.  Is it just me, or has this man been coasting on the goodwill created by ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Leon"" for too long now? He seems to have no clue how to construct a story, or convincingly develop characters.  There is so much left unexplained, unexplored and undeveloped at the end of this film that the plot is reduced to a meaningless excuse for action sequences.  When the action is this good, that may be somewhat forgivable, but I still fail to understand why a few rewrites were not in order.  It's one of those scripts in which the hard-bitten hero has a change of heart just in time to save everyone, not because he's learned a valuable lesson, but because it's time to do so.  The girl he finds in the trunk of his car is the hinge on which the entire story swings, but it's never fully explained why she was in there.<br/><br/>I give an 8 to the director and cast contributions, and a lowly 4 to Besson for his lazy screenplay, leveling the film out at a 6.  See it if you like great action, but don't expect to be told a story of any worth."

","Most of the movies I bother to comment on are the ones which people say they didn't like because the plot was weak...but if they're honest, most people should tell you that the thing about an Action movie trailer that gets their attention is the ACTION!  But most people aren't honest.  They wanna pretend that they went to the movie expecting a brilliantly-written story.  Well, I got news for ya:  Every action movie you see is going to have a weak plot! A Drama had darn well better have a strong plot, sure.  But an Action movie -- 9 times out of 10 -- is going to have a weak plot!  Why?  Because when you see an Action movie trailer, you don't say, ""wow, that sounds like a thought-provoking story.""  No, you say, ""WHOA!!  THAT MOVIE'S GONNA ROCK!!"" So, as I've said many times before, let a movie be what it is.  So okay, with that said, yes, the plot of The Transporter was like something from an episode of ""The Rockford Files"" stretched out to movie length.  BUT, The Transporter is clearly (to anybody who's seen the trailer) an Action movie. If you had seen the movie's trailer, but didn't know it was an Action movie when you bought your ticket, then you're an idiot.  Now, fast-paced, kick-butt action is the real reason you wanna go see an ""ACTION"" movie, correct?!  I mean, that's why I went to see it!  And I was not disappointed in the least!  The action in this comes at you hard and heavy through the whole movie, barely stopping for a minute to catch its breath.  Yeah, they did a few things that are highly implausible, but who freakin' cares!  I see reality all day long!  A little imagination never hurt anybody.  Which is not to say that the whole movie is full of impossible stunts, but it does have its share.  But my point is this: When I saw the trailer for The Transporter, I said, ""Whoa!!  That movie's gonna rock!""  And what did I say as I walked out of the theater after seeing it?  I said, ""WHOA!!  THAT MOVIE ROCKED!!""  So did I get what I expected? Absolutely!

","Hello Everyone,<br/><br/>I had the privilege to see the sneak preview of the Transporter last month, and, well.....lets just say that the first 3/4 of the movie is fantastic! The last quarter of the film is an abysmal wreck. Here where the movie critic (I suck at being a critic, so keep that in mind) in me comes out: -warning SPOILERS ahead- The film is based upon a great premise as you all know (who wouldn't want to get paid large sums of cash for 'Transporting' stuff around in a kick-ass stat-of-the-art BMW), but there are a few places where your suspension of disbelief needs to be tightened up a few notches. The first car chase scene is fantastic with Jason Satham playing the cool, ultra-professional transporter Frank Martin, making his BMW jink around corners and fly around twisties the way anybody worth their salt does in GTA3.<br/><br/>The trouble comes when he is trapped on an overpass and surrounded by police cars. How does he get out of this? Make the car jump into the air from a stand still of course! I've done this in my car on many occasions, rev the engine, lock the independent front brakes, burn the rear tires, and let er' rip! OK, I know its a movie, I'll let that pass, maybe he had a running start of a few feet and a conveniently placed ramp, I'll give that one to them.<br/><br/>I won't go into the heat seeking, shoulder launched, chase-people-around missile scene, but I must bring up the scene where the hero is in a Cessna 182 at about 100 feet off the ground with a conveniently cooperative pilot. This scene has our hero chasing two cargo trucks that are carrying loads of illegal immigrants who will be sold into slavery (the reason he gets involved), now note that I said TWO trucks! Flying over the highway at about a hundred feet, he spots the trucks, tells the pilot to climb and straps on a parachute. Three seconds later, at about 8,000 feet.....woah!!! Hold on there, did I just say 8,000 feet? How can a small aircraft outperform a military fighter at full afterburner? Perhaps they implied that it was a few minutes later, maybe I just missed it...maybe.<br/><br/>Ok, he jumps from the airplane, streamlines himself and dives down to the highway. After opening his chute well behind the convoy (which is doing highway speeds), he actually catches up with the trucks! One minute he's behind them, the next you see him catching up with the trucks and landing lightly upon the rearward one. Alright, if anyone out there knows how a parachute nearing the ground can do 90km/hr (this was no HALO jump either) let me know, I just don't know anything about skydiving.<br/><br/>The last, most disturbing thing about this movie was that second truck. If anyone out there has seen this movie, please correct me if I'm wrong! The whole emphasis of the movie was the rescue of these two trucks full of people, but in the end scene, only one truck is stopped. Nobody seems to give a hoot about the second truck?!?! Did I miss some dialogue? Perhaps they said ""cargo container"" not ""cargo container(s)"" when they mentioned the people, I'm just not sure, but every time I heard them I swore they were talking about both containers (on trucks at the end). Will someone who is going to see this movie PLEASE listen for that, I would love to be proven wrong.<br/><br/>Overall, if you like action flicks I would go see this one at a matinee and leave after the oil-fight scene (you'll know). The characters are great, especially Frank, Inspector Tarconi, and the villain 'Wall Street', the fight scenes are really done well, and lest we not forget...the driving.<br/><br/>I rate it about 5 out of 10 and pray they rework the ending before it releases."

","Luc Besson has traditionally given US audiences something more than your standard Hollywood action film, often with thrilling (La Femme Nikita, The Professional) or visually dynamic (Fifth Element, The Messenger) results. So what went terribly wrong with The Transporter? Perhaps it was the director's (Corey Yuen) heavy reliance on the stylized John Woo and Jackie Chan inspired action sequences. But that can be fun sometimes. Perhaps it was the improbable scenarios and James Bond like clichés. But that, too, can be fun, even when the diabolical evil mastermind waits to kill the hero providing him enough time to be saved. What really went wrong with this film was that the story and main character got lost after the first car chase sequence.<br/><br/>
Frank Martin is The Transported, played perfectly cold faced by Jason Statham. He is wonderfully introduced as a well organized, manicured, and precise driver hired for transporting ""packages"" for high fees, no questions asked. This is an austere man, following his own protocol and rules to keep his life ticking as perfectly as his watch. I wanted to get to know this interesting and reserved person from the moment he tersely negotiates with bank robbers on the first job we're privy to. He drives up to a bank at the strike of 10 am just in time to pick up his load - four bank robbers with masks, guns, and bank sacks. As he calmly explains that the contract was for three men, no more, and that he is not proceeding until the contract terms are met, the robbers threaten with guns and the cops start closing in around them. Through some good negotiation skills and some fancy and fantastic car handling skills, The Transporter soon has the men out of the situation and returns to his seaside home to clean up the minor mess to his car. BMW had several notable directors (Ang Lee, Guy Ritchie) shoot short films for the web, some with dramatically good results. The car chase sequence follows this theme with great results.<br/><br/>But then something terrible happens with this wonderful start to the film. His next assignment, to carry a bag to a hillside mansion, turns bad when he opens the wriggling package to find a fresh and soft faced Asian girl with model good looks. Breaking his rule never to open the package results in some bad consequences. After he kicks two motor cops into submission, we loose the interesting guy and are left with only an action hero flexing his muscle and beating up on multiple guys at a time. The story about the thinking, motivated professional trying to walk the line as a precise driver in an imprecise and dangerous world turns into a mess of fight sequences and large explosions. Gone is the Martin with the clean suits and sharp dialog. We're left with a buff martial arts guy and no plot. This could be expected from the Hollywood studios and some of the lesser interesting Hong Kong action films but I expected more, both from the early hints of a real character at the start of the film and from Besson's earlier works. Sadly we're left with action fluff about as satisfying as cotton candy. Have fun with the car chase and oil spill antics, just don't be surprised if the sugary mass turns to air after the lights come up."

","""The Transporter"" was recommended to be my a colleague as one of the worst movies he had seen in recent years. While I usually take claims like this with a grain of salt, in this I think there was a lot of truth in it. ""The Transporter"" is an extremely lackluster, uninspired attempt at making a cool action movie, which manages to screw up in almost every aspect.<br/><br/>First, there's the story. It makes very little sense, and is so predictable and full of clichés that you can guess where it's going to go almost immediately. None of the characters, including the hero, are even remotely interesting, and everything is so rushed that there is no room for character development at all. You might as well watch some cardboard cut-outs.<br/><br/>Billed as an action comedy, ""The Transporter"" does indeed offer a lot of action, but only very little comedy. There are some things that are supposed to be funny, but, with two or three exceptions, they really aren't. Unless completely inept and cartoony bad guys are still supposed to be funny...<br/><br/>That leaves only the action. And while there certainly is a lot of it, and in spite of some impressive pyrotechnics, it's for the most part really dull. Apparently, the makers of this cinematic dud have gone to great length to make sure that the main characters comes across as really cool. The problem is that the things he does aren't even remotely possible in the real world, and are for the most part so exaggerated that they become unintentionally funny rather than cool. On top of that, the hero is so completely invulnerable that any tension there might have been is completely ruined.<br/><br/>And finally, there's the music, which is in one world awful. For some reason, just about every action sequence in the movie is accompanied by either some annoying hip hop song or some totally nondescript and monotonous rock number.<br/><br/>I wish I could find something positive to say, but there really isn't anything I can think of.

","The Transporter is an excellent film in My opinion. Jason Statham is excellent in this film! He performed very well. He is a good actor and he has a tremendous physique. I am amazed all the things he can do in a film! Matt Schulze performed well as the villain and his character was quite ruthless. Ric Young also played a good villain. Qi Shu was also good. The action is incredible! I just couldn't believe some of the scenes in this picture! The action is outstanding! The music by Stanley Clarke is great! The Transporter is one of the most exciting action films I have ever seen and if you love action and want to see Jason Statham as a great action star then I strongly recommend this film!"

","""The Transporter"" tells of an Brit ex-Army macho mercenary driver-for-hire in the South of France who will deliver whatever wherever with no questions asked and gets embroiled in a thrill a minute escapade when one of his packages turns out to be a passenger. An obvious and predictable formula action flick with some okay stunts, firefights, thrill rides, and even a little sky and scuba diving, ""The Transporter"" is just a good old fashioned machoduck not-to-be-taken-seriously funfest with all the requisite titillators except T&A, sex, and nudity.

","THE TRANSPORTER (2002) **1/2 Jason Statam, Qi Shu, Matt Schulze, Francois Berleand, Ric Young.  Top-notch action sequences squeeze some volatile juice from a tired genre : the compromised action flick, this time with cool as ice Statam in the titular role as an ex military operator  who makes his own rules in delivering any goods for a price until he winds up to his neck in an Asian slavery ring racket involving the latest of his jobs (Shu). The aforementioned stunts and set-ups are fun and fast at a breakneck speed involving car chases and some nifty fight choreography  rise above by the flat-footed dialogue provided by the screenplay (co-written by producer Luc Besson)."

When he is hired by an American criminal to deliver a package, his curiosity leads him to break the rules, and he discovers the package he is delivering, is a Chinese woman named Lai. <br/><br/>Learning that Frank broke the rules discovered Lai, the criminal sends his mercenaries to assassinate him. <br/><br/>Frank takes it upon himself to protect not only himself, but Lai, as he agrees to help Lai rescue enslaved people from China, who are being smuggled into France........<br/><br/>If you've seen any film produced by Luc Besson in the last thirteen years, you will know that they are hugely over the top, very silly, and in some instances, blooming awful (Taken 2, Colombiana).

A man, a solitary man who doesn't break any rules, breaks one fundamental one and everyone wants to kill him.<br/><br/>But he can kick butt, and lots of butt is kicked. With the added bonus of Statham not putting on a ridiculous accent, this is the film that got him noticed, and even though its nothing to write home about, he has screen presence.<br/><br/>The main plot involving him and the girl may have been stolen from The Big Hit, but it's still dumb fun."

","It's not a good thing when my reaction to most of the movie is ""Are you serious?"". Some parts of the movie were doubtful and confusing. I even struggled to understanding what was going on at some parts of the movie. For instance; the part where Frank and Lai is diving to escape. 1. Why does he have an extra mask there for her. 2. when they're underwater suddenly they both have full scuba-diving gear with masks, oxygen-tanks and swim feet. For me, moments like this weakens my impression of the film. <br/><br/>However if you love epic fighting and explosions I really recommend this title. There were tons of fighting and explosion. At some point of the movie two cars just collided and exploded.<br/><br/>The part I liked best about the movie was the start. That was really well made.

","Dear God, Why create a human being who can make a movie of this kind?

For me, I need something with substance and fewer actors who sell out to chase something i'll never understand they are after.<br/><br/>As the subject states...so painful I was hitting the sides of my head in disgust...now I have a headache making this movie even worse.<br/><br/>Good luck if you enjoy this Rated 2 for that hot Twainese piece...it would've been 10 but the rest of the movie is something I wouldn't wipe my ar*e with so had to scale down accordingly."

"Anonymous_Maxine","6","1","2","14 March 2009"," Fast action and paper thin characters...
","There are certain action movie premises that never go away despite the fact that they always produce movies that are clones of countless unimpressive action movies that came before. The kidnapped child, the raped and murdered wife, the otherwise wronged family, or in this case, the crusade against corrupt businessmen, smugglers, drug dealers, etc. Take your pick, they generally all turn out about the same, don't they?<br/><br/>Jason Statham is inarguably today's fastest rising action star. He blasted onto the scene with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (a smashing action movie despite what I can't get over thinking is just the goofiest title) and soon followed it up with other action movies like Crank and Snatch which are absolutely overflowing with awesomeness. <br/><br/>The Transporter movies are great vehicles for Statham, although this one was hardly an impressive first outing. It starts out great, with four guys scrambling madly out of a bank they've just robbed and jumping into his car, where he calmly sits motionless and informs them that there are four of them but the deal was three and then proceeds to list off all the reasons why four guys just won't do, including that it throws off the weight calibration of his suspension and will exceed the amount of gas that he has allotted for this particular delivery. <br/><br/>The situation is, ah, resolved, and he puts the pedal down and leads the French police on an exaggerated high speed chase through the streets and alleyways of Marseilles that is so overblown that it promises to become one of those movies like Wanted or Shoot 'Em Up that are soaked in every excess imaginable but are nevertheless tons of fun.<br/><br/>And for a lot of the movie that's what we get, but unfortunately its also populated with paper thin characters and cartoonish villains involved in a preposterous human smuggling plot. <br/><br/>But I'm getting ahead of myself. Statham is, as the title informs us, a Transporter by trade. He makes his living by delivering things without asking questions and commands a conspicuously massive salary. The shadiness of his clients is to be expected, hence his insistence on never giving his or learning their names. He has three rules about his services  I forget the order, but they involve never changing the deal in any way once an agreement has been made (hence the tense confusion at the beginning of the movie), never giving names, and never looking in the package being delivered. <br/><br/>When you're dealing with the kind of people that he deals with, it's generally best not to really know much about what's really going on. Especially when you have a friendly but attentive police detective making occasional house calls to your beautiful beach house and wondering about things like getaways being made in cars exactly like yours and when that last car later gets found blown to pieces with two police officers in the trunk. If nothing else, the French seem pretty generous with the benefit of the doubt!<br/><br/>But despite this string of good luck, he breaks one of his own rules on his latest delivery, accidentally buying an Orangina for the contents of his package and then letting her go off into the woods to pee. We never learn much about why he was asked to deliver this stunningly sexy Chinese girl in the first place, but it soon becomes clear that her family is involved in a massive smuggling operation involving smuggling bedraggled Chinese people out of China. Incidentally, I watched the movie last night in China with a bunch of my Chinese friends. They were not amused.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie, unfortunately, is an exercise in Action Movie-making 101. It's flooded with action clichés and predictability, which is disappointing even though there wasn't really a time in the first half of the movie where it promised to be anything different. <br/><br/>But the bigger problem than the clichés and the predictability are the sheer lack of thought put into the script and the senselessness of the entire premise itself. You see, the Chinese girl's father is currently smuggling ""400 people in a container"" through Marseilles. Is this for real? 400 people in a container the size of a semi trailer? Shipping through Marseilles? I had been under the impression that a container traveling from Hong Kong to, say, America takes something like 4-6 weeks. But to travel ""through"" Marseilles on its way to somewhere else? Such a trip would take months and I'm just going to go ahead and guess that roughly 0% of the cargo would make it through alive. I don't know much about the logistics of human smuggling, but I'm guessing that such a percentage would do some damage to your profit margins.<br/><br/>But no matter. The evil criminal scheme behind the action is beside the point, it's little more than a catalyst to differentiate between the good guys and the bad guys and give them something to fight over. Jason Statham is cool as hell in the movie, but his costar may be a good Chinese actress (she's much more famous here than she is in America, so's you know), but she just can't act in English. She reminded me of the horrendous performance by the heroine in First Blood Part II. <br/><br/>At the time of this writing I've seen half of The Transporter II, which immediately comes off as a much better movie than the original, which places it in the diminutive category of sequels that surpass their original movies. Statham fans and hardcore action fans may get a kick out of The Transporter, but behind the high class action gloss and Statham's star power it's a b-movie at heart."

","I had a hard time sitting through this masterpiece of modern impossible action untertainment and wasn't the least entertained. <br/><br/>Others have made enough comments on the impossible stunts, so I'll spare details. <br/><br/>When a movie goes overboard it becomes unbelievable - this one breaks that line big time. Even some Schwarzenegger flicks and the impossibly surreal ""Chronicles of Riddick"" worked better than this one!<br/><br/>Conceptually the whole thing is similar to a 1977 (TV movie?) ""The 3,000 Mile Chase"", which is also listed here at IMDb. Except that I found that original courier chase story far more enjoyable. <br/><br/>In today's video game culture something is missing - a good reality check!<br/><br/>Hollywood has always managed to do the impossible, but things have gone too far out of reach for a real human being with even half a brain and a little basic physics education to imagine being part of the story. Never mind ""character development"" - bland or psychotic, I see people every day that make movie characters seem real by comparison, ""developed"" or not :)<br/><br/>But for the entire action thing going here: Thumbs down!<br/><br/>I think modern directors and writers need to watch some of the classic flicks like Burt Lancaster's ""The Crimson Pirate"" to understand what really good stunt and action work is all about - make it real with and for real people and forget computer animation!"

","Presumably M.Besson produced ""The Transporter"" between two more pressing engagements.Indeed one might be forgiven for thinking that ""produced"" might be too strong a word.For this is a film that has run amok.I lost count of the number of ""hommages""up on the screen to such an extent that it seemed one long ""hommage"" to dozens of infinitely better movies. To get to the particular rather than the general,the hero is a narcissistic criminal of indeterminate origin whose desire for anonymity is so strong that he leaves a box of snapshots and souvenirs on top of a cupboard.He is a man so unthinkably stupid that he uses his own car when hired as a getaway driver in a bank robbery.His sole attempt at concealing its identity consists of fitting revolving number plates,a device James Bond was using forty years ago.Duh......I think the Old Bill have rumbled that one son.For some reason not made clear he has a laissez - faire relationship with the local flic that is almost oedipal.He drives a black and shiny BMW penis - symbol with fine disregard for other road users and clearly needs a refreshment course on the Highway Code.He has - and you could have knocked me down with a rolled - up copy of ""Soldier of Fortune"" - a background in the military.And just in case you thought he was a clerk in the NAAFI there's a medal thrown carelessly in his ditty box.He is played by Mr J.Statham in a particularly tight - fighting suit.He is a man so vain as to be unable to resist gazing lovingly at his own image in every reflective surface he comes across.Presumably Mr Statham wishes to assume the mantle of Mr S.Seagal in the comedy action hero stakes,but I must say he has a lot of ground to make up.He is not as funny,neither does he display Mr Seagal's sang froid in dispensing mayhem.Mr Statham wrinkles his brow a lot to signify thought,something Mr Seagal never has to do.I am not entirely sure what accent Mr Statham attempts to assume,he appears to be a little confused himself at times,veering between Bob Hoskins and Joe Pesci in random fashion.To be fair to him he has very little to work with,he might as well be playing the tooth fairy for all the basis his character has in reality. There is a nice line in product placement,if I was considering doing a blag,for instance,I'd give serious consideration to big Beamer after watching this.And if I had shares in ""Orangina"" I would be well pleased. Mr Statham was prominent in ""Lock,stock and two smoking barrels"".I suspect ""The Transporter"" will appeal to the same audience of mainly lager - swilling wannabe geezers who will sit in front of their tvs burping happily trying not to knock their cans of Carling over as they reach for their Naan bread and Lamb Tikka."

THe stunts were terrific although implausible - just the way an out and out action movie should be.

","Somebody's comment included ""action-by-numbers"" well that must mean it has been accurately made to the correct formula. This movie takes all the clichés and standard elements of modern action movies and adds a twist of just possible reality. With the expected plot turns and the main character's charming bit-of-rough standard action hero script, it could easily be merely one of hundreds but the skill with which the recipe is followed produces an outstanding piece which succeeds without too many flashing lights and impossible supernatural feats.<br/><br/>Yes it is unlikely that such a man exists but it is well within the realms of possibility and he is never meant to be perfect, just plausible. It has Luc Besson stamped all over it but is different enough from his more renowned work to enjoy and the user ratings show that female voters in all but one age group rated it, on average, more highly than did their male counterparts; so it seemingly caters to an audience different than most would assume and that is probably due to Jason Statham's style.<br/><br/>On an entirely personal level: I think Statham's acting is superior to that of many over-hyped, over-paid Hollywood stars, he has the journeyman's trait of doing a good job without overstating his own importance and is often under-rated. It is good to see him in a leading role. Of course I have no idea if he really is a nice bloke, let's just hope so."

Qi Shu makes for nice eye candy, but her grating voice, accent and over-acting shatters her sensual image every time she opens her mouth. The extended fight sequences (way too long in my opinion) are spectacular, but they can't carry the movie. The non-fight scene stunts, in my opinion, were the best parts of the movie.

","Verdict? Truly awful. The choreography for the fight scenes are laughable.<br/><br/>When a film contains a 'superman' who can take on a dozen men all at the same time, clearly we're entering into the world of fantasy and for the film to work it has to be played for laughs. The main problem with the film is that it took itself too seriously. Or rather Jason Statham played it too seriously. Statham has to be the worst actor in living memory, and seemed to be incapable of showing any expression or emotion in his cold, lifeless eyes. He just about gets away with it in, 'Oceans eleven' probably because he occupies so little screen time. To give you an example of Statham's acting in the film, in one scene his house is blown up. How are you going to feel if your house is blown up? Angry? Mildly irritated perhaps? -Not if you're Jason Statham. Having just seen his house destroyed and turned into complete rubble, his face doesn't register even the slightest muscle movement. He just can't act. Maybe, he should have watched Gene Hackman's turn in, 'Enemy of the State' when his house his destroyed for a few pointers. Even at the end of the film where he's reunited with his love interest, you'd think if there was ever an opportunity to smile and show a bit of life, this was it. What does he do? Same static, lifeless expression. Painful.<br/><br/>Given that the whole premise of the film is that Statham is the best 'transporter' there is, transporting packages from one location to the next, no questions asked, you'd think there'd be a few good car chases to demonstrate why he is supposedly the best. And is there? Not, in this film.<br/><br/>Badly acted. Badly written. Badly choreographed. Truly awful.<br/><br/>3/10"

Sure.......all of them ! No comment on the Scuba-gear scene... ), I find myself mystified who would ever want screen-credits for writing it ! Even the obligatory ""rousing"" fight scenes are stupid, uninspired or even cool ( most baffling to me). Not even redeeming wit or self-effacing irony dare pop up... laughs crawl in by accident, only.<br/><br/>One of the movies that give the action-genre in general a bad name - sorry. If it wasn't for for the nice scenery and the beautiful Qi Shu ( as ""Lai"" - but you can buy a bunch of posters for the price of admittance) this would be a total bomb - this way it gets 1.5/5 flat tires..."
"jre9","3","1","2","17 May 2003"," Bad Acting, Poor Plot, So many continuity errors = Bad Film
","This is a really bad film, how it did so well begs to be asked. The plot is really terrible and is not helped by the useless acting skills of Jason Statham, why will he not just use his natural London accent? He plays ex-British military, but still feels the need to add an awful American twang to his dialogue. <br/><br/>The plot is so stupid, even for a mindless action flick. Whereas films such as Jackie Chan's use tongue-in-cheek action, this film tries to be cool, but is laughable. <br/><br/>The music in the film really adds an element of pure cheese. The hip-hop beats played to car chases is really inappropriate. It works well with ""The Fast and the Furious"" because they have some cool vehicles, but not with a BMW being chased (really slowly) by a few Citroen police cars! The music during the ""romantic"" scenes is poor and makes you wonder if any of the budget was allocated to the music.<br/><br/>
How this didn't go straight to video, we'll never know.<br/><br/>This film had me and my mates in stitches, it was just so bad we had to laugh.<br/><br/>DO NOT buy this, Rent it if you must see it, but don't say you weren't warned."

The martial arts were great.  The OIL scene was something right out of a JACKIE CHAN MOVIE.

","First of all, I feel I should point out that it was actually CORY YUEN who directed the movie, NOT Louis Leterrier (who was actually the ARTISTIC director). This fact is listed on the DVD box and in the opening credits. Still, I can understand why who originally submitted the credits to the IMDb may have been confused, because you would be kind of hard pressed to successfully compare this to Yuen's (usually superior) Hong Kong product.<br/><br/>Before that, a look at the plot. We have an extremely thin plot here. All that's going on is more or less a simple smuggling operation. The bad guys behind it are simply greedy gloaters who will kill if it's necessary - and that's ALL that's done with them! Even with the two ringleaders; about all that's different about them is their ethnicity. It isn't much better with the protagonists. Jason Statham looks good and throws himself into the action well, but he can't do much more than that, playing the same old tired hard-lined loner with a murky past. Shu Qi is pretty, though sometimes has problems with her English dialogue, and her character is even thinner than Statham's.<br/><br/>Now back to the action. The scenes did have the potential to be great - a fight in oil, struggling all over a transport truck speeding down a freeway - but they are ruined by what quite often ruins action scenes in Hollywood movies (despite the fact the creative part of this particular movie is non-American):<br/><br/>(1) Too-quick camera movements (usually hand-held)<br/><br/>(2) Unbelievably fast editing, that chops up the action instead of holding sight of it and playing it out like a ballet of sorts (what you will find in the best Hong Kong action movies.<br/><br/>I also need to point out that the editing in this case is even worse, sometimes cutting out ""links"" that result in people or cars all of a sudden jumping from one place to another.<br/><br/>No need to rent this, when there are plenty of good action movies already sitting in the catalog sections of your local video stores. Even if you see this for free, it's still likely you'll feel ripped-off at the end."
"deltaforce7","1","1","3","3 April 2013"," One of the dumbest movies ever made
","+There may be a small spoiler here+<br/><br/>I do not know why every low-grade movie director from Asia feels that it is his sacred duty to be making pointless movies about Asian gangsters and a stylized ""kung-fu"" fighting. This movie is definitely of of those. What I especially disliked about The Transporter is that everything and everyone in it is unnatural, cartoonish and dumbified even for an average ""superhero"" flick. And as far as the action-movie qualities go, The Transporter offers and cookie-cutter set of typical ""action"" effects - a car chase (a way unrealistic one!), a missile-launcher shooting and explosions (waaay pointless), lots of unrealistic small-arms shooting (do you want to see rifle bullets flying straight through think brick and mortar walls? why?) a ""kung-fu"" fight (Jackie Chan probably puked if or when he watched it), a car-bomb bada-boom (a HUGE blast, but no one gets hurt), and a difficult and inner-conflicted supporting character. In short, it is a dumbified movie that takes itself seriously for no reason whatsoever."
"poolandrews","6","1","3","1 May 2010"," Enjoyable action film.
","The Transporter is set in Marseille in France where ex-military man Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is known to the criminal underworld as a 'Transporter', a man who who can act as a getaway driver or deliver an illegal cargo from one place to another. Frank accepts a job to transport a bag across France, on the way to his destination Frank gets a flat tyre & has to get the spare from the boot & notices that the bag is moving. Curious Frank takes a look inside the bag & sees a Chinese woman named Lai (Qi Shu), Frank delivers the cargo to the destination & gangster Wall Street (Matt Schulze) gives Frank a suitcase to take back with him but it turns out it's packed with explosive & blows Frank's car up while he is inside a roadside café. Wall Street wants Frank dead & sets out to kill him while Frank reluctantly rescues Lai who tells him of an operation to smuggle hundreds of Chinese through Marseille...<br/><br/>This French American co-production was directed by Louis Leterrier & Cory Yuen & is a fun & energetic light hearted action film that could be described as a sort of cross between James Bond & Die Hard which has already been said about The Transporter franchise as a whole before, I must admit I did actually quite enjoy The Transporter for what it was. The script isn't the best with several poorly thought out moments like when one moment we see the kidnapped Lai is tied to a chair & then the next she's in the back of a car that Frank steals still tied to a chair. I mean how did she open the car door? How did she get in the car tied to a chair? How does a chair even fit inside the back of a car? How did she close the door once she was inside? How did Frank not notice a fully grown woman tied to a chair in the back of a car he just got in? Why did they kidnap Lai anyway? Why did they hire Frank to take her to that Château? Why is she free to do anything she wants at the end? What happened to the second truck full of Chinese at the end? How did Lai's father get to the truck Frank was driving so quickly? How did Lai get the gun off the Chinese gangster when we clearly hear her scream? Some sloppy writing & plotting hurts the film (alos, tellingly only four character's in the entire film are given names) but on the positive side The Transporter is quite likable, the main character played by Statham is likable & although his forced relationship with Lai seems clunky they make a nice couple & have a certain on screen spark, the bad guy's are alright if a little faceless & generic while the good natured cop has his moments. At a shade under 90 minutes at least it's short & moves along at breakneck pace, your never too far from something blowing up, a gun being fired or a fight scene which is definitely a good thing.<br/><br/>To be honest where The Transporter excels are it's action scenes which are great, from car chases to exploding houses to shoot-outs to imaginative fight scenes that have an air of Jackie Chan about them as Statham pulls out all the moves & uses various random objects to help him like his jumper or barrels of oil. Thankfully there's none of that horrible quick editing, everything here is well photographed & it's clear to see what's going on, who everyone is & where they are in fight scenes. The car chases are cool too although I wish they had used the huge trucks at the end a bit more. The ending itself is a bit of a let down with a brief stand-off & a rushed final few minutes that would have benefited from better send-offs for the villains. A word also goes for the French locations which are really nice, shot mainly in bright daylight the locations look really nice.<br/><br/>Filmed in France the production values are good, there's a lack of CGI computer effects & to my eye most of the stunts were real time stunts performed on set which helps the look of the film enormously. The acting is fine, Jason Statham was made for roles like this where he plays a likable action hero & he's pretty good here while Qi Shu is attractive as the love interest.<br/><br/>The Transporter is a fun & enjoyable action comedy with energetic fight scenes & some cool explosions & car chases, Statham is likable as the hero & despite some poor writing I liked it for what it was. Not a masterpiece by any means but an enjoyable way to spend 88 minutes. Followed by Transporter 2 (2005) & Transporter 3 (2008) both of which drop the 'The' from the title."

This 007-like role can only be played by a Brit, and Statham does an excellent job. An action film that doesn't have much meaningful dialog, but just enough to make the characters interesting. I love the dry humor, and pun filled lines. After breaking his own rules, you see very well choreographed and exciting fight scenes  albeit not very believable  that's not what this film is about.

","I love this movie.<br/><br/>I've seen it I don't know how many times since its release and I never seem to get tired of it.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. Frank is man who will transport anything anywhere so long as you follow his rules. For Frank the rules are what keeps him safe and out of trouble. Of course Frank breaks one of the rules and he suddenly find himself on the run with a girl in tow with police and the bad guys on his tail.<br/><br/>This film has great characters who say very funny things, the exchanges between Frank and the police officer name Taconi is wonderfully funny and knowing. It has incredible action the likes of which you've probably never seen, the opening chase is one of the best ever put on film, and o course the battle in the oil.<br/><br/>Its a wonderful film that completely falls apart dramatically in the second half. Once Frank and the girl come face to face with the two bad guys, the film ceases to make logical sense. Whats going on (apparently a plot to smuggle Chinese into France, though its not really clear) is less important than getting Frank to the next action scene. Whats so troubling is that even after 30 or 40 viewings it feels like the film makers never had a clear direction past a certain point in the story. Its not fatal, but it is annoying.<br/><br/>Plot collapse or no, this is a great film that really should be seen. Its just two hours of good fun, and great times.(Besides it sets you up for the sequel, which in many ways is better than this, even though it too has plot problems)"

Of course he had pretty iconic roles before this, although they didn't bring out the legendary masculinity that is praised all over the world.<br/><br/>Luc Besson has created the image of a somewhat ideal man: a confident guy capable of doing almost everything, wearing neat stylish suits and driving fast gorgeous cars. Almost James Bond on a secret mission to deliver whatever you desire. The set of rules professed by the Transporter gives a certain charm as operating within boundaries requires a quick wit and ingenuity, plus it always looks badass when you break the rules with righteous intentions.<br/><br/>The movie is a perfect example of a well balanced action flick that incorporates an interesting story with incredible choreography of fights and smart scene planning. In my opinion this film is an official breakthrough for Jason Statham and a solid beginning of a franchise that makes all men produce buckets of testosterone and forces women to open windows to reduce a sudden temperature spike in the room."

I won't go into details, because they are worthless. I wanted to see action and camera work, as well as chase sequences, and even those failed.

","Incredible fight choreography and Statham athleticism (along with his usual cool and charisma), along with cars and buildings that go Kaboom!, offer plenty for action fans to embrace in this custom made star vehicle that follows a highly paid ex-military mercenary who performs tasks for customers with particular ""packages"" they want delivered to specific locations under certain conditions. He has rules to abide by so that the transport goes without a hitch. Well, he ""opens a package"" and what stares from within his trunk is a very pretty Asian woman (Qui Shu). She tells him of slaves being transported by those who hired him to bring her to them. If he doesn't help her they will die or be sold. What ultimately triggers his war with these dirtbags who initially hired him to bring them Shu is their attempt to blow him up in his car, a bomb disguised as another package for him to deliver. When they fire missiles at his château, it is game-on! With Matt Schulz as a lead heavy in cahoots with Shu's rotten pops (Ric Young), making Statham's life most difficult. The use of oil and the shirt off his back and the ability to fight himself out of cramped confines against a litany of men (inside a greyhound or sandwiched between carrier crates in a transport yard are such examples) are just some of the amazing stunts and fight scenes that make up this hotly paced actioner. The finale has Statham trying to avoid gunfire and Schulz' interference as he attempts to commandeer a truck hauling the human slaves in an exhilarating chase sequence. The fighting in the cab of the truck gets intense. Statham's use of his quick legs and how he orchestrates speedy kicks and sharp reflexes produce breathtaking results. The film opens with a humdinger of a car chase highlighting Statham's talents also behind the wheel. The whole point is to signify that Statham has arrived and no matter the firepower or manpower, he seems more than capable to avoid harm while others aren't so lucky."

","The Transporter (2002): Dir: Louis Leterrier, Cory Yuen / Cast: Jason Statham, Shu Qi, Matt Schulze, Francois Berleand, Ric Young: Title regards giving and receiving of information without care or thought of consequence. Jason Statham plays the title role whose job is to transport merchandise without asking questions. One such package happens to be an Asian female tied up in the trunk of his car. He is not suppose to look at the merchandise but upon discovering the victim he is targeted by terrorists. Typical plot is just a series of action and stunt scenes to solve absolutely nothing. The action is directed with exhilaration by Louis Leterrier and Cory Yuen but their writers are obviously lacking ambition in the creativity department. Statham was appealing in Snatch but here he drives fast, makes narrow escapes and beats up ten guys at once. Shu Qi is the hostage. After appearing in this dreadful mess she will likely need to go back into the trunk again to hide the shame. Other roles are your standard investigators and mindless thugs that fit like puzzle pieces in formula plotting. Generally they end up on the receiving end of Statham's foot up their ass. There is no point to this mayhem other than to employ senseless violence for sheer pleasure.

I just wish he had decided sooner (at the start of the film, preferably) not to try to put on an American accent. By the end, he is just using standard Estuary English, which works fine with his character.<br/><br/>His trade as a high-end courier (would The Courier have been a better title?) working for any criminal gang that wants his services leads to interest from the local police inspector, played by Francois Berleand, who also turns in a wonderful performance. Scenes between the two of them work well. But, as acting credits go, that is about it.<br/><br/>The movie is well directed, well edited and beautifully photographed. The fight scenes are tightly choreographed, often in narrow corridors, and Statham earns his money in those scenes. If you like car chases, you will love the first few minutes too.<br/><br/>Although the plot does not really make sense, it exists as a framework to hang all the shooting, fighting, diving, driving and explosions – and they are good.<br/><br/>There is the inevitable 'love scene' between Statham and Qi Shu (bet you saw that coming) but it's all over very quickly, as if the director realised that it's not what we're here for.

The Transporter is a rip roaring, red blooded, action packed flick that will leave you cheering and enjoying every minute of it. It has absolutely everything you could possibly need from an action movie. The gruff, tough hero, a European background, organized crime, martial arts, stunts, explosions, car chases...and everything else. Best of all it does actually have good story even if its completely predictable and simplistic but there is nothing wrong with that as long as it works and it does!! <br/><br/>Statham is as bad-ass as any legendary action star you can think of. His character of Frank has more depth than you think at first and his good guy side wins out every time. This is one of my all time favourite action characters. Qi Shu plays Lai, Frank's package to be delivered, that turns out to be more than expected. She does alright although her wild nature makes her sort of annoying and she is often hard to understand. The chemistry between her and Statham is decent but not perfect. Really also enjoy the performance by François Berléand as Inspector Tarconi, the adversary/friend to Frank. I enjoy their banter and their storyline and they could have used it more both in this one and future sequels.<br/><br/>Creator and writer Luc Besson is synonymous with action. The Professional, The Fifth Element, Unleashed, Taken...just to name a few of my personal favourites. Simply put he knows what people love in an action film. First timer Louis Leterrier helms the film and clearly does a great job. He went on to do some very big projects like the sequel to this and Clash of The Titans. I think he's probably a big action film fan himself and so he handles the story, content and character perfectly. If you love action even a little you should be watching this right now. It is the perfect flick to enjoy yourself beginning to end and look forward to the sequels. Jason Statham will win you over every time. 9/10"

His film Leon proved that but that was very enjoyable and was believable whereas The Transporter, well oh dear. This was watchable don't get me wrong, but as Hollywood trashy fun, minus the word fun mostly and it's just Hollywood trash.<br/><br/>Well the basic story is that Jason Statham plays ex-army soldier Frank Martin who ""transports"" packages for anyone to earn money, but Frank has three rules, which are no new deals or renegotiation of old ones, no names and never open the package, but he breaks the rules and gets involved with a Chinese girl Lai (Qui Shu) whose caught up in people's smuggling.<br/><br/>And that's it, the film suffers from lack of story or depths to the characters, which makes them uninteresting and you not care about them. Lai sleeps with Frank for no reason even though he treats her badly, though he is just doing his job. There are plot holes the size of a black hole like the villain goes after Frank because he opened the package, but he was nowhere near him when he did it, so how would he know? That's never explained. The script and dialogue is very cheesy and cliché. Also the acting is atrocious, no one can act in this though Statham isn't too bad, but he just wasn't convincing much at all nor was Qui Shu and even though Francois Berleand as Inspector Tarconi was good, the script didn't help him even though Frank and him have a history, that is never delved into. The only reason I gave this a three star was because the action was though preposterous was exciting and choreographed well with some nice scenery and music, but this was predictable and badly made mostly.

Certainly you'll be hard pressed to name a better photographed action movie than this one <br/><br/>The screenplay co-written by Luc Besson centres around a criminal played by Jason Statham being caught up in a people smuggling ring from Eastern Asia but the film doesn't really explore people trafficking , its main function is to cram as many fistfights , car chases and shoot outs as is possible even if they're somewhat unlikely . It is after all a pop corn no brains actioner and for what it is it's fairly well done"

","I saw ""The Transporter"" with my brother and sister while holidaying in Scotland. I was expecting a formulaic and predictable film with bad acting and mechanic action, but what I got was the complete opposite. There may be some weak spots in the script, and Shu Qi doesn't always convince as the beautiful captive. But the film is beautifully filmed with lovely cinematography and gorgeous scenery, and has terrific action sequences that help the film go along at a fast pace. The story is a good one, and the soundtrack is energetic. With the exception of Shu Qi, the acting is not bad at all. Jason Statham has a cool charisma that does shine through, and Matt Schulze seems to be having a lot of fun as the lead bad guy. The direction is efficient enough, overall this is a fun action flick if a tad on the short side, helped enormously by a confident sense of style and the action. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","How did the girl manage to go into the second car while her hands, so her feet, were being tied up to a chair? Why the gang didn't send a simple guy with one gun to kill the Transporter and the girl at the first's house? (Great waste of ammo if you asked me!). How this Transporter gets illegal jobs to transport bank robbers, while his face is exposed for all??<br/><br/>Naaaaa.. Don't bother yourself. It deals with shutting up, and shutting down, the brain. So at one point, when a bunch of bad guys attack the lead frantically, you'll notice how all of them is without guns, and after long-4-parts fight with them you'll see FINALLY the bad guys WITH the guns coming pretty late I suppose, or is it the right time, regarding the nature of it as straightforward pure direct-to-action flick. It's a typical moment to define what really this movie is all about.<br/><br/>It looks like some of the action movies that were made in Europe in the 1960s & the movies of Hong Kong in the 1980s, being clever when it comes to deliver popcorn, so it's a good transporter itself. The action is wonderful, the backgrounds are gorgeous, Qi Shu was charismatic and childish, François Berléand was mildly funny, the music score is enjoyable putting a human feel to it, and the rest of the soundtrack drives the movie as a disco night.<br/><br/>On the other hand, (Jason Statham) is really silly, looking more like his car. Yes, he did his share of fighting fairly, doing most of his stunts. But away from that he's metallic, and electronic, except for the few moments where he gives us his bad impression of Clint Eastwood!<br/><br/>The motive of the lead, about smuggling Chinese people, can be replaced with anything else: money, gold, drugs, expensive art piece, nuclear bomb, kidnapped kid, et cetera. Of course the ""people"" will put a sensitive side to the character and make a human out of the (Statham). Though, the movie deals with them as if they're just like any of the previous choices. Anyhow, this is unmixed action time, so don't be BORING!<br/><br/>I must say that (Matt Schulze) as the evil EVIL guy (Wall Street) was ugly, particularly with his idiot eyes. He almost said to the lead: ""Hey, there is a bomb in the bag I'm giving you, I'm evil man Ha Ha Haa!"". But, to tell you the truth, I think that (Ric Young)'s hairpiece was uglier!<br/><br/>And what about the 2 police patrols that the transporter met while the girl's attempt to escape? He was a reason of their horrible death! Originally, to where he was taking them during their being in the car's trunk? But why the scriptwriters would bother themselves with points like that, you'll forget it anyway during the loud next sequences, and with the lead saving all the souls at the end, he's wholly forgiven!<br/><br/>Watch out for the scene where the transporter survives a shower of bullets by hiding behind a door. You'll find that again at the next Transporter movie; I began to believe that doors can be bulletproof indeed!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's saner than its sequel. For instance, you read that at (Statham)'s request, the producers took out a moment when his character deflecting a missile with a tea tray, at the assault on (Frank)'s house, as ""he didn't think audiences would believe it"". In the next movie, they'll listen to Statham less (it's something related to getting rid of a bomb in a car's bottom!).<br/><br/>In this formula, I've been bothered the most by one part; when Jason Statham is forced to take off his shirt, being in one long fight with so many unarmed men, getting into a mud fight-like with dozen of them, then concluding this sequence by kissing another man (Ugh!) just to suck air out of him in the water!! It's not a haphazard; it's the way some movies want to be commercial even if cheaply and disgustingly.<br/><br/>Anyway, you can watch it while traveling in a bus, or if you want to beat some people you hate, or at lonely night when you're not able to sleep. In fact, I read that the real money that this movie made was through the DVD sales.<br/><br/>And yes, I think that the monkey in the photo with the child was (Statham) as a kid not the other way around.. Just kidding :)"

","All through watching this film - the thought that it was specially written for Jean Claude Vna Damme kept popping up in my head. The naff storyline, the kick-boxing moves, the lack of dialogue for the leading man, the army of nameless heavies, the almost compulsory Japanese bad guy / girl / even director. The plot - which i will NOT go into here - is rudimentary to say the least. The amount of times people just happen to turn up in scenes without any realistic semblance of how they got there is incredible - it must be a record for a movie. Couple this with the total number of unrealistic stunt moves carried out and you have yourself a bona-fide turkey. For instance, trucks propel themselves forward on their own without a need for a driver, a small plane goes from a hundred feet up in the sky to thousands of feet in a blink, the hero can somehow dodge a thousand bullets and still manage to incapacitate 3 bad guys with nothing more than a jumper !!! i watched this knowing what it was beforehand - a cheesy action flick - but it still took some swallowing to believe the plot. The best award must go to the guy who somehow managed to squeeze a further 2 sequels from this franchise. After the first film - the whole cast and crew should have been sent straight to DVD dungeon never to appear again. How they convinced anyone to make another 2 movies is beyond me. The Transporter is a poor man's Bourne - and that is a derisive remark to Bourne. If Van Damme had done this - then it would have stayed where it belonged - the bargain bin.<br/><br/>3/10 - just for sheer cheek of conning us with this movie."

","I like Panerai watches, but, apart from the lovely Shu Qi, this film had little more to recommend it than a Panerai watch commercial. If I'd bothered, I would have lost count of the number of times Jason Statham looked at his watch. However, like Ryan O'Neal in the similar film, The Driver, that seemed to be almost the limit to his acting. I half-remember a review of The Driver that said that Ryan O'Neal had a range of emotions from a to b. Jason Statham is the same; he has ""grumpy"" and ""looking at his watch"". The film also reminded me why I stopped buying Stanley Clarke's albums twenty five years ago. The soundtrack was clichéd at its best, and normally far worse. If you want a film with car chases get Ronin, but avoid this like the plague."

","This is based on nothing. Everything explodes, but it blows nothing. The elements that were used on this film will be regarded, i suppose, as the main characteristics in action films from this first decade of the century. We have a specific cinematography, based on blue tones which in the end work as a kind of sober image, tough, hard. This is supposed to set the tone for the action, which will be choreographed, but also hard, heavy, sometimes violent. Editing has a fundamental part in all this, many times we, spectators, won't be allowed to understand exactly everything that happens. The Bourne features started this, i think, Casino Royale successfully exploited the notion, as well as several other films. Not this one. This is a collection of useless tricks, which don't work in any situation, in any part of the movie. There's nothing here. It emulates badly its references, it lives on a certain style, but that style is corrupted and it is incompetently used here.<br/><br/>My opinion: 1/5 stay away.<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","The Transporter is about a man named Frank whose job it is to transport things. He lives his life by following rules designed to get him out of trouble. It is clear early on that many of his clients are criminals. However, he is professional and does not pass moral judgment.<br/><br/>One day however he breaks one of his rules. He looks inside a package in the trunk of his car to find a woman named Lai. By breaking his rules, he spirals into trouble.<br/><br/>It's interesting to see people torn between professional conduct and moral conduct, as it is a decision we all have to make, and different people will make different decisions.<br/><br/>As a criticism, the movie's fight sequences seem too choreographed. Frank's fighting style is not smooth and flowing but rigid and sequential.<br/><br/>The damsel in distress Lai is very attractive, and sometimes I wonder whether this sends the message that only beautiful women deserve to be saved.<br/><br/>The movie concerns smuggling of people from Japan to Europe, presumably France. At the end we learn that the refugees seem to respond to Japanese. Since refugees tend to flee from poor and unfree countries to rich and free country, what just doesn't seem right is why Japanese people would be smuggled to Europe.

Somehow all involved have achieved the amazing feat of making a second-rate Euro-doo-doo-chop-socky flick watchable, enjoyable, and even involving.<br/><br/>Jason Statham plays Frank, whose job title gives the film its name. But he's not just your average lorry driverhe drives a mean car and will transport anything, anywhere around the Med, for a price. He's careful, taciturn, precise and likes routine. Within that framework, anything goes.<br/><br/>Life breaks in on his steely solitude in the form of a woman (surprise!), and sets off a chain of events  but honestly, the rest of the 'story' is just thoroughly entertaining nonsense hardly worth summing up. Suffice to say that a bulked-up Jason Statham is surprisingly good in the central role  the only serious defect there being the daft transatlantic accent. Statham couldn't be more London if he tried.<br/><br/>The movie's colour, humour and pathos come from able sidekicks Qui Shu and Francois Bearléand, and from Frank's (human) inability to live out his life by the cold logic of the lonely code he has set himself. In its harshness, his code reminded me of the terse commands of the Way of the Samurai, but in its application it is funny or brutal by turns. It's a credit to Statham's acting (yes!) and fighting skills that he lifts this above cartoon fare, and to the cinematographer that it looks much better than it deserves to.<br/><br/>For yet more very enjoyable tosh, check out Statham's ""Crank"". I can't remember when I laughed so hard. That boy's got something"

","I saw the advert for this on TV, and I thought it looked quite cool, so I tried it. Basically, The Transporter, or Frank Martin (Lock, Stock's Jason Statham), an ex-special forces man, is now a secretive man who sticks to strict rules (mainly his own). He is basically hired by many people to transport anything they want with no questions asked and no names given, only where to go. One of his delivery's though has a rule broken where his curiosity leads to opening the delivery to someone called Wall Street (Matt Schulze), and he finds a Chinese girl, Lai (Shu Qi). When Street finds out that he broke a rule, he decides that he should be dealt with by many assassins. With his life now in danger, he is both on the run, but also, with Lai's help, going to rescue many Chinese prisoners to be enslaved, being smuggled into France by Lai's villain father. Also starring François Berléand as Tarconi and Ric Young as Mr. Kwai. I must admit there might not have been much of a story to pay attention, but all the action, explosive and chase sequences never disappoint. Worth watching!"

The comic sense is added into the movie due to his 'rules' of transportation. Just three rules and if anyone of it is broken he always lands in trouble. Lai (Shu Qi) is one such 'cargo' which he is supposed to deliver but he breaks his third rule and all the trouble starts. To add to the trouble got a local inspector suspecting him of some foulplay.<br/><br/>It has got a simple story, well directed action scenes and some light humour in between.

","First let me say that this is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed the first time I saw it and every time I've seen it since. I would have paid to go see this movie which in the age of cable and DVD is a high compliment indeed. However, as I am the idiot who sits in movies and says things like ""That's a Model 1911 Colt and this movie is set in 1908!!!"", I do have a few nits to pick with the movie and they are all things that could have easily been rectified.<br/><br/>Frank Martin drives, according to the Inspector, a 1999 BMW 735i. Now while I am by no means an expert on Euro-spec cars, one would think that a 3.5 liter six-cylinder would be a bit weak for the kind of work Frank does. I would pick an M5, 4.4 liter V8 or take a less conspicuous 540i six-speed and buy modifications from Alpina to bring it up to M5 specs. Maybe he needs the extra trunk space of a 7-series...in that case, the 745i V8 or the 750i V12 would be a much better choice. While I'm not sure of Euro-specs, in the US the 745i and 750i were only available with automatic transmissions and that would take some of the drama as well as the skill away from Frank's driving. At least here in the States someone shoehorned a 5-liter V12 into a 5-series BMW and mated it with a six-speed manual. Why couldn't Frank drive a 7-series with a V12 and six-speed? All the producers would have to do is stick on a 750 badge!!! (That 5-series with the six-speed and V12 is for sale and if I had 25 large burning a hole in my pocket it would be in my driveway...) Now, about Martin's military background...while he was sleeping the girl found pictures which would indicate that he had been an American helicopter pilot, Gulf War era. Now, although Jason Statham does a pretty good job of downplaying his British accent, he would have been much more believable as an ex-SAS operative, especially with the level of fighting skills he displayed. I'm sure in light of the crop duster plane sequence it was important to show that Frank had flying skills, however I wish our pilots were as well trained in hand-to-hand combat as Jason is!!! (9-11 would be a footnote of a couple of failed hijackings in that case...) Admittedly, in my service I was a Pathfinder attached to an aviation unit and several of our warrant officer pilots had been Airborne Ranger qualified enlisted men before going to flight school. I too am a Ranger School graduate and my hand-to-hand combat training nowhere approaches Frank Martin's level. Only the SAS, Dick Marcinko's Seal Team Six and maybe Delta Force could possibly fight at that level.<br/><br/>Statham looks convincing though, and not since Steve McQueen have I seen someone who actually looks like he maybe can drive as well as he does in this movie (possible exception of Robert DeNiro in Ronin, whose research for any role is legendary and other-worldly). I did like this movie and will watch it again."

","This film had such a crazy energy. I loved it! Statham has a wonderful and clean fighting style that I've come to admire. Yes, I actually check out fighting styles in action/martial arts films. I like to see that the actor is making up an individual fighting style that suits their character. His fighting was as clean, smooth, and edgy as his driving. I wanted to be in the car with him. A movie's good when you wanna be in it. I was a little put off by the ending being about the Asian slave trade. It was resolved rather blandly and haphazardly. All of a sudden, there's a mass of Asian slaves coming out at the end. You didn't find out anything til the end, and you were still kinda confused. They should have explained things a little earlier and a lot more clearly. As an action film, however, it pumps you up. The music they used was really hot and had you bumping and feeling like he'd be a cool dude to chill with. As a storyline issue, you weren't sure if he was French or from somewhere else and living in France. You just wanted to know more about him so you'd have a stronger basis for rooting for him. All you know is that he can fight, drive, and catch the ladies. He's a French Bond? He's clearly more than that, so they should've fleshed Frank out a little more. I know it's an action film, but Jason's worth the effort :). Truly a good film to get into. Statham better keep up the good work."

","OK... I don't care what other people say, I think this movie is one of the best action movies around.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Well for starters, the film has plenty of action sequences. ""So what?"" I hear say. Well the difference is between the ones in this movie, and others, is the fact that they are far more ""stylized"". By that, I mean the fighting action is like a mixture of Hong Kong Kung Fu action, and the kind of action that you would normally find in an action movie. It's John Woo for the West!<br/><br/>The second is probably far more important: Realism. OK, I can agree that the movie's plot is a bit far-fetched, and this does make the movie seem unrealistic, but it's the small things that make this movie stand out. Take the shooting scenes for example - We see the bullets (Albeit in tracer form). How many movies can you see the bullets in? This adds to the realism of the movie and the tension. Also, when Frank Martin is chasing after the lorry, he's not in a cool looking car or one that can go at over 150 MPH... No! He's in a rubbishy, small MANUAL car. Yes, MANUAL. Unlike most movies where every single car seems to be automatic transmission, we can actually see gear changes! OK, the last point may seem trivial, but it's that along with the fact Frank Martin uses another guy's breath to breathe underwater, and uses the pedals on a bike to stand up in slippery oil, that make the film stand out, showing that the main character is not just muscles and testosterone... He actually THINKS.<br/><br/>Overall, the movies rocks. Jason Statham is a credit to us... The British."

But what I got was a GEM!!!!! <br/><br/>After the end of 90's and the decline of ARNOLD-STALLONE presence, Hollywood was really going for ACTOR oriented movies than ACTION oriented HEAVY WEIGHTS (which is Good by the Way). In an arena now starving for ACTION STARS, this movie really redefines the Golden-age Action Films and makes the answer for the NEXT LEVEL ACTION HEROES.<br/><br/>Directed by Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen, tells the story of a man who makes a living with the delivery of illegal things.<br/><br/>The Transporter (Spoilers******) <br/><br/>After ending the military carrier Frank Martine (Jason Statham) is now in the field of smuggling. A disciplined, solo professional who transports criminal materials in his BMW for the outlaw customers. He has strict rules for his service which makes the Transporter a noted name in the crime world.<br/><br/>But things went wrong when he got a new assignment, to transport a package which happened to be a lovely Asian girl(Qui Shu).<br/><br/>Scripted by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen tells the Hard Hitting Fast Paced story of The Transporter - Frank Martine. A great structured screenplay for an action movie, which also blended with another dimension of Underworld and Romance. Tremendous camera works, enriched with in the fast cutting editing which really demanded in the movie. Credit goes to camera team of Pierre Morel and the visionary editor Nicolas Trembasiewicz.<br/><br/>Both the vehicle and the physical stunts were done brilliantly. Fight was well choreographed by Film Director Corey Yuen and the Stunt performers rocked in each frame. The man who steal the show Jason Statham, his portrayal of Strong and Silent - Good Bad Man was the best thing in the movie. I wish he would appear as 'Agent 47' if Edidos game company brings their Hit-man titles as movies, he will LIVE in that character. Plus lovely lady Qui Shu was really treat for eyes in every frames.<br/><br/>All and all it's a great movie which stands in the Top of high rated Action titles. A true action movie of the 2000's.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10 out of 10 !<br/><br/>The Transporter = Action movie with a defined dimension."

","There no word to describe how bad this movie is. It is just another really cheap attempt movie.<br/><br/>The story: The transporter broke his own rules by opening the package he has to deliver to the mafia. That when they decided to kill him and the girl in that package.<br/><br/>It is a HUGH disappointment watching this movie. Frank acting was like bring a stuntman to make a movie; Qi Shu can't even speak right most of the time. The story is horrible, even worst was the score and the dialogue. All they do was adding fighting scenes from time to time. And how the hell is all the French mafias know Kung-Fu.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a Hugh disappointment; Qi Shu can't seduce me to watch this movie anymore, it is just damn bad.<br/><br/>Rating: 4/10 (Grade: D-)"

","Given that politics and old age have side-tracked the last generation of action stars a search for new generation must proceed a-pace. Jason Statham was OK in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and a little better in Snatch (both directed by fellow Brit Guy Richie) so he is given the reluctant nod in this action no-brainer. <br/><br/>The fact that he can do stunts helps too (although not all of them, unless he grew more hair while parachuting!) making him more than suitable for this nervous try out. Sadly he can't do the needed American accent to save his life!<br/><br/>JS plays a strange ""no questions asked"" transporter. The guy charges more than Federal Express, but Federal Express don't allow the transportation of girls in sacks with tape across their mouths. When our hero breaks his own rules and interferes with ""the package"" all kinds of problems unfold.<br/><br/>What we have here is - in all reality - a Hong Kong pot boiler with a bigger special effects budget. Sadly the script seems to have cost the same as it would down Sweat Shop Avenue and some of the dialogue is truly gut turning and terrible. Clearly the work of people that don't have English as their first language. <br/><br/>However when it moves, it moves well, in a James Bond kind of way. The modern audience might not know it, but the quality of the stunts on display would have probably knocked the 1960's audience on to the cinema floor. How times have moved on!<br/><br/>This product has nothing further to report on other than the fact that Taiwanese female lead - Oi Shu - is sexy beyond belief. Although the tape across her mouth does constitute something of an improvement..."

","""The Transporter"" is a surprisingly well made, if routine action-adventure film. There's a better story here than the one told, but star Jason Statham delivers the goods and has a real future as an action star. Statham is the most virile action hero since Sam Elliot and is built like a hairy Greek god. He also sounds like Billy Idol. I saw this movie primarily to see Qi Shu, who impressed me so much in Jackie Chan's ""Gorgeous"". Qi Shu has the kind of face that looks as if it were made of the parts of two different beautiful women. Her mouth certainly doesn't go with her eyes and nose and keeps her from being stunningly beautiful. However, she uses her mouth the way many actors use their eyes, and her contribution to ""The Transporter"" and cinema is largely due to that expressive mouth. She's perfect in ""The Transporter,"" giving her character much more than is written.<br/><br/>What keeps ""The Transporter"" from being first rate is the directing and editing. Much of the dialogue is unintelligible and some of the action scenes suffer from unwise editing. Watch the ""deleted scenes,"" which are actually extended fights and you'll see what I mean. Had the fight scenes been left intact,the movie be worth a ""7"". As presented, however, I give ""The Transporter"" a ""6""."
"padason","10","0","1","10 September 2004"," This is a great film
","This picture is pure action and is a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood today. It keeps forcing ridiculous female heroes and boyish men in the role of hero. Jason Statham is tremendous ,the bad guy( who I recently saw in Steven Seagals atrocious Out of Reach) is also great. Shu Qi is gorgeous and the film is beautifully shot ,the fight scenes are sharp and unpretentious.The dialogue at times is dodgy as is the soundtrack but I would actually buy this on DVD and be proud of that fact. If people say an overlong pretentious piece of excrement like Le Grande Bleu(also by Besson) is a masterpiece then the the Transporter is a modern action classic"

","I havent read the other comments, yet... but having just seen this movie, I thought I'd add my opinion.<br/><br/>Great stuff. Action scenes are well executed. The movie is just the right length... not too long. <br/><br/>The hero is a relative unknown, but performs excellently as Frank, the clinical, calculated ""Frank""... an ex-special forces ""retired"" transporter of illicit goods... no questions asked until he meets Li, one cargo he wasn't bargaining on.<br/><br/>The plot is relatively simple, the characters are very obvious, yet it works... very well... <br/><br/>If you're looking for a well crafted action flick, this movie will be a very pleasant way to spend an evening, if you're looking for the next Matrix, and don't appreciate simplicity, you should probably avoid.<br/><br/>All in all, the Transporter is a fast paced, solid action movie with great fight scenes and a noble plot. Well worth the rental fee, and definately a good way to pass an hour and a half, if youre a fan of the kung fu/action genre.<br/><br/>8/10"
"susrnlds","Null","0","1","7 June 2004"," Good Action, But Could Have Been Better.
","Already at the very beginning, after the car chase scene, this movie seems promising of heavy action sequences. The soundtrack is an important contributing element to the film's fast pace. Statham's performance as the calculating 'transporter' is exceptional.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a few sub-par elements take the shine out of this movie. Among them is a particularly bad performance by some members of the supporting cast, and (most importantly) a very weak plot. Basically every scene of the movie includes Statham, thus giving little opportunity to get to know the foes or their intentions a little better.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good action movie with very well achieved stunts. It is only regrettable that the trade-off for good action is the lack of attention provided to the making of the story.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I saw this movie without any high hopes. At the rental place they just didn't have anything I hadn't seen or would wanna see. Except for this movie. It laid in a corner. Jason Statham I had already met in Snatch witch is one of my all time favorite movies. But this director I had never heard of. According to previous experience this movie could not be any good.<br/><br/>O contrare as I found out at home. It is a full grown action movie with great effects and a lot of overdone action. The story is some how weak because of the predictability, but that is very well compensated by the main character and his accent.<br/><br/>A great movie to watch for everybody who can accept matrix like moves and like to listen to an English accent of Jason Statham."
"modius","Null","0","1","2 June 2004"," Above-Average action movie that lacked real danger
","When I first heard action superemo Corey Yeun was going to work with British actor Jason Statham to make a film called 'The Transporter', my mind started to think 'oh no - yeun has decided to ruin his career'.<br/><br/>However as soon as I saw this movie, I was actually quite surprised to see Mr Statham pulling off some very impressive martial art moves however I think it was ruined by constant quick-cutting and MTV-style editing, which reminded me of the overly-cut fight sequences in Rush Hour.<br/><br/>The film, which I'm sure will spawn a b-movie version called 'The Courier' and will probably star Steven Seagal or Dolph Lundgren, has Mr Statham a very good Courier with a pretty name, ie: the Transporter.<br/><br/>He delivers goods and has very strict rules.  But one day he decides to break his own rules when he discovers he smuggling a pretty Chinese girl around France.<br/><br/>The film has lots of good, excellent action sequences - which include impressive fight sequences - but you should never judge a movie based upon its first 10, 20 minutes of action.  This movie slows down, a heck of a lot - to explain its plot.<br/><br/>The pretty Chinese girl's dad (whom I'm sure was wearing a lot of make-up) is in cahoots with an evil criminal with a goatee (you knew he was evil because his passport picture) to smuggle lots of Chinese immigrants across France.  Why?  Err, I'm not sure.<br/><br/>The film suffers from horrible dialogue, fast-cutting and sequences where I felt Jason Statham's character was never in any danger.<br/><br/>Overall this is an average action movie that could, should have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Rating: 4.5/10"

What with his house being riddled with bullets and him finding 2 breathing apparatus under his house etc.<br/><br/>I know films are fictional and love most kinds of action films which are hardly true to life but this one really stretched it!<br/><br/>I hope Jason does another ""good"" film soon to quickly erase everyones mind of him being in this one."

","Just rented it and I am blown away. For some idiotic reason I didn't see it at the theater. But man, is the preview ever a bit different than what I expected. No fooling, this is a good flick with alot of deep substance underlying the characters. I can tell the guys making this were REALLY into it cause you can just tell they had a ""Blast"" making it. The characters are likeable and genuine and the frenetic pacing and rhythm of the whole thing give me a real thrill. It's so quick and so slick that I can see how there are rapid Asian elements blending with French super cool style now. The director Corey Yuen and filmmaker rebel Luc Besson are a lethal combination, oh yea. I mean these guys mean business, this movie is no joke. It just wouldn't let up. Everything is constantly moving forward, the story lean and mean, very very strong story telling technique. Also, the score was dazzling the way it complimented the energy of the film. And yes, Jason Stratham is on a whole nother level of cool. I seen his cool in Guy Richie's gangster movie ""Snatch"",when he played Turkish and have been on the look out for this cat ever since. That too was a genre breaking film. It incorporated black humor in the style of Pulp Fiction but in a way all its own. Oh yea one last thing. I seen The Transporter again at my friends house on DVD because I told him to rent it and he too was blown away. I don't know how to explain it really. I guess the closest way would be to say The Transporter transported the action genre into a whole new arena of filmmaking in that they make no apologies for cutting right to the chase. Puns intended. O it's in your face story telling alright. John Woo, Robert Rodiguez, Quentin Tarantino and Guy Richie probably spilling popcorn all over the darn place in laughter as they watched ""this thing"" go nuts on their big screen T.V.<br/><br/>
P.S. If you blink, um...you may want to rewind the movie, you probably just missed about oh say, fifty-thousand cuts. That's round numbers of course.<br/><br/>
P.S. II Something that may help prevent you from missing anything could be to use a clamping device such as that used in ""A Clock Work Orange."" That would keep your eyes wide open for the duration of the movie.<br/><br/>P.S. III  ~A New Beginning~      Why is it that when Luc Besson has a vision, T.V. sets are on the verge of exploding? Just a thought.<br/><br/>P.S. IV  Cautionary Note   Be careful when you remove The Transporter DVD from your DVD player after the movie has played. It was spinning so fast and caused so much friction that I actually burned the palm of my hand when I went to pick it up. I now have a second degree disc burn on my hand that reads The Transporter with a guy balancing two Berretta hand guns in mid air performing a drop kick."

"Li-1","Null","0","1","3 April 2003"," The Transporter proves action movies can still be fun.
","*** out of ****<br/><br/>The Transporter has little in the way of plot or character development. That alone will put off a lot of viewers, but for those looking for a slice of thrilling escapism, there probably won't be a more enjoyable pure action film all year. The filmmakers here have accomplished with a very moderate budget (30 million) that most big-budget blockbusters can't with three times the amount, and that is to work as a consistently entertaining thrill ride from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The imperturbably cool Jason Statham stars as Frank Martin, a transporter who follows three rules. Unfortunately, he breaks his most valued code: never to look at the package. What he finds in the trunk of his car is a young, beautiful Chinese woman (Qi Shu) named Lai. She eventually tags along with him, as various thugs and henchmen try to kill him and retrieve her. From there, it's one brawl after another all the way to the film's eighteen-wheeler finale.<br/><br/>Corey Yuen has always been an exceptional action director, and this time around, he stages some of the most memorable fight scenes of his career. Most particularly, I'm referring to the oil-slick fight, a delightful setpiece that displays a kind of (intentional) sloppiness that's refreshingly fun to watch. The high-speed finale pays homage to License to Kill and Raiders of the Lost Ark, boasting spectacular stunts and fast-paced mayhem. The film's last half-hour or so is virtually non-stop action, delivering the sort of virtuoso choreography that most of today's American action films lack (Equilibrium being a major exception).<br/><br/>Overall, there's not much to say about the acting. Matt Schulze is terrible, as always, and Qi Shu struggles with her English (though she and Statham make for a surprisingly decent romantic pair). The lone standout is Statham, who's I'm convinced will be the next big action star. He has more charisma than Vin Diesel and is also a more physically agile performer, able to show off plenty of fancy martial arts moves in a completely believable fashion, even if he doesn't actually know any martial arts (who knows, he might). <br/><br/>The Transporter's story isn't anything special. From what I gathered, it's about illegal smuggling and people being made into slaves. Basically, it's a script perfect for typical action fodder. A great story isn't necessary to enjoy The Transporter, which succeeds because of Statham's charismatic performance and Yuen's fabulous action sequences. The Transporter is tight and fast-paced, lots of fun, and a must see for action fans."
"Spleen","Null","0","1","14 March 2003"," The images say ""cinema""; the music says ""television""
","Style over substance? Not really. That's what happens when the director can't resist the temptation to include what he takes to be a cool-looking shot and in so doing makes nonsense of his own story or characters or themes. What we have here is style WITHOUT substance. There's no reason, all things considered, why the characters couldn't have been more involving as characters: there's nothing in the slick, zippy pacing, or the lovely golden photography, or the stylish French setting, or the cleverly conceived and choreographed fight scenes (for once, the word ""edgy"" actually applies; there's something exhilerating about the way the editing is ALMOST too fast to defeat its own purpose, but not quite) ... there's nothing in all of this that COMPELS the characters to be ciphers.<br/><br/>Partly for this reason it doesn't even matter very much that they are. The film's construction, down to the very rivets, is solid, so while a keener sense of everyone's motivation would be nice, the film doesn't really need this much to hold itself up. Remember, it does go beyond the call of duty in other respects. It opens with an exceptional car chase sequence, and the oil-wrestling scene (one of those things which everyone who's seen the movie is likely to talk about) shows how it's possible for the hero to plausibly defeat several bad guys at once in a novel way.<br/><br/>My main problem (which also doesn't matter very much in retrospect) was with the music. ""The Transporter"" may look and feel like a real movie, it may BE a real movie, but the music kicks in it sounds like a dodgy, charmless television cop show. This is not just an association of ideas. Music like this is inherently wrong for the big screen."

Statham plays an interesting character as an ex Special Forces type that retired on the coast of France, taking work on the side as a transporter of extremely hot illegal packages that even the criminals would not want to transport themselves. He is a no questions asked one man Federal Express type  transporter of  illegal goods. He is just the right person for the job too, highly experienced ex military ,  quick thinking , organized and effective and can't be pushed around by even his hardest core customers. Now Statham is a meticulous professional that takes pride in his work, who lives by a set of simple rules. 1) Once you agree to the contract, it does not change, 2)  No names / no questions  asked   3) never look in the package.<br/><br/>Well the story is basically what happens when he breaks rule # 3. I will leave at that for those who may not have seen the movie yet.<br/><br/>The action sequences are very well done , the pace of the plot is fast and the dialog is quite funny.<br/><br/>This gets a 9 out 10. Not because it academy awards material , but because that is how I felt when we came out of the theater ."

","I didn't expect any dialogue, plot or real creativity, and I came out very satisfied with this experience. I will note this as a piece of brilliant stupidity, and film so bad that it is funny and breathtaking in its concept. While the audience simply blurs through fight/action scene aimlessly, at least they were well made and not all made on some guy's laptop. Funny and often times engaging, at least the producers knew they were making this film for pure action freaks and theater jumpers looking for a good second film to watch. Highly recommended, but feel free to get drunk or stoned or whatever because being sober or inebriated won't take away from the flow of this film."

","A couple of friends and I went to go see this when we had nothing to do. I don't regret it.  The movie was terrible, but it was so funny.  The action and story were so bad that it was hilarious.  We couldn't stop laughing. If you like to laugh at really crappy movies, go see this.  You won't regret it."
"Austin4577","10","0","1","5 November 2002"," I wouldn't mind paying $7 more to watch it again....
","Jason Statham(Frank) is the ""transporter"" he delivers anything to anywhere. And he gets payed very well. He doesn't talk much which makes the movies more interesting. Someone gets in his way, better get their ass ready for ass kicking.<br/><br/>Great car chases, stunts, fight scenes, and effects. This movies is definely a 10/10. I hope they make a sequel to this movie. Cuz its really great."
"nv001122","10","0","1","3 November 2002"," Great action movie
","Fun, fun, fun and more fun. Its an action flick plain and simple. It was simply drivin' and stayed driven all the way through. Story line sufficed for the movie genre."
"uds3","Null","0","1","1 November 2002"," What you see is what you get!
","Did anyone ever go to see THE BIG BOSS or FISTS OF FURY for the plotline and character development? I think not!  So it is with THE TRANSPORTER, an action flick I way preferred to XXX. If you're after something meaningful, go watch something else, don't totally pi-- me off and write underwhelmingly dumb comments as to how shallow the storyline is! <br/><br/>Jason Statham is the ""transporter""...he delivers - WHATEVER, wherever! That's what he does, no more no less..and it pays well! He doesn't talk much, he doesn't have to and if people get in his way, well..all that elite special forces combat training comes in pretty handy doesn't it? What IS so good about this flick, quite apart from the prolific action sequences and martial arts work-outs that leave Bruce Lee and THE MATRIX in their wake, is the simple but majorly effective characterisations. Statham as Frank, invites you to LIKE him..why? because he's likeable. Similarly, Francois Berleand is a major plus in his smallish but extremely effective role as the Detective who has been on Frank's ""case"" since he ""retired"" and set up home locally. Miss Shu is a major plus also, being very natural and extremely feminine as Lai Kwai a girl in the wrong place for MOST of the time.<br/><br/>Awesome pyrotechnics, auto stunts, fight sequences and some decent laughs along the way...NEVER was the price of your theater ticket a better investment.  Back to the drawing board Vin!"
"scttgrswld","10","0","1","30 October 2002"," great action just what the movie was made for!!
","If your just looking for awesome action, then you really don't need a complex story line. For instance batman the movie, not a lot of story (a little more then this one but not a lot) but plenty of the batman hero and good action. Well, this movie was the same, shady career turned hero in the end plus AWESOME action. A little message to you critics out there, you need to adjust your judging more to the different types of audiences out there and not just to your desire for a good story. This movie is an action movie and that's what it was made for, Action, coolness. A little advice to the audience out there if you feel like a good story to watch when deciding what movie to goto, don't see the transporter, but if you feel like you want to see a good action movie.....man you've got to see this movie critics, do you see how I adjusted my wording to appeal to action lovers, man thats all right!"
"Curveball6","10","0","1","28 October 2002"," Superb action movie, Jason Statham is awesome
","Superb action movie, and Jason Statham is the next big action star. Wonderful car chases, superb martial arts sequences, and subtle comedy as well.  One of the best action movies I've ever seen.  Bruce Lee would have liked this movie!"
"movieguy1021","6","0","1","26 October 2002"," The Transporter: 6/10
","Car chases are about the coolest stunt in an action movie. To my latest count, The Transporter had three.<br/><br/>Frank (Jason Statham) is a transporter: he delievers packages from one bad guy to the next, no questions asked. Or he may even carry passangers, as seen from the first scene. But when he opens a package that seems to be moving and screaming, things start to turn to the worse. Soon everybody is trailing Frank and trying to kill him. Just an ordiniary day in the life of a transporter.<br/><br/>The opening car chase scene is the coolest one I've ever seen in movies. Sure it's unlikely (nay...impossible), but this movie isn't about what can happen in real life. The subsequent chases pale in comparision, but are still pretty cool.<br/><br/>The plot, however, is anything but cool. In the first half, the plot was the consequence of opening the package. In the second half, it's about 400 Asian immigrants and the girl (Qi Shu) from the package's father working for the bad guy. Or something like that. Action movies like this are supposed to have you not really think about anything except for basic plot and explosions (like the one at the rest stop...awesome!), but you had to follow the plot or else you wouldn't understand what was happening.<br/><br/>The best non-car-chase fight sequence was in the bus station. Buses...$35,000. Fighting ten guys on an oiled floor...priceless. At some times, Statham's moves seemed like he was break-dancing. Speaking of Statham, he could be the next action hero. With his Bond-like stunts and his Diesel-like build, move over Brosnan! There's a new hero in town.<br/><br/>Shu was good as a girl with tape over her mouth, but she soon became an obnoxious person who wasn't fun to be with. Shu, and almost everyone else in the movie, had accents that were hard to understand a lot of times. If they learned anything from The Osbournes, it is that they can put subtitles in English-it'll help!<br/><br/>The music was right on-key, helping tense the situation and then relax us, and then tense us up again. In the beginning, the sound FX really helped to bring out the quality of the sound. Music can be obnoxious if used in the wrong places, but in some places, like The Transporter, it helps bring out the mood.<br/><br/>The bad guys, on the con side of the film, were so one-dimensional that they must have aced Stupid Bad Guys 101. On the test: Question 1: True or False: When the person you're supposed to kill disappears, just assume that he died. They must of tried to kill him and ""succeeded"" three times. What a load of idiots. And some of the film was so utterly unbelieveable. Statham just knows how to scuba-dive, parachute, has a giant house with an underwater passage to another house connected to it and has a million Mercedeses. Right...<br/><br/>Well, enough of my mumbo-jumbo. If you just skipped down here to have me cut to the chase, here it is: Fun, mucho action, and some awesome chases counter against one-dimensional bad guys and horrible plot. I'm not sure if I recommend it or not, I guess just see it for yourself to figure it out.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for strong action violence and some language."
"steveproj","9","0","1","24 October 2002"," Leave your brain outside, and enjoy!
","It really is a no brainer, fantastic stunts, great hero (who is actually a bad guy, but you don't care) and a gorgeous woman, say! why does she suddenly fancy him anyway? I must have missed that bit. Pay the money and go see it..."
"sidaco2001","7","0","1","22 October 2002"," A new action hero is born but the plot of this film sucked!!
","A new action hero is born in this movie. I won't be surprised to see him in other action movies as he should. The plot of The Transporter sucked so bad but luckily the action was awesome as hell. It never ceased to entertain me, but again i must say the plot SUCKED!!"
"nelson_family01","10","0","1","20 October 2002"," Action packed
","This movie is awesome from the get go. Never heard of the actors but they did a great job. So much action going on the movie never loses interest. Similiar to a James Bond film but a different twist. A must see. Hard to comment on this movie due to not giving it away."
"mm-39","6","0","1","17 October 2002"," Like a 70's Hong Kong action flick!
","This movie is comparable to an 80's Chuck Norris film, or many of Bruce Lee's films.  I would not call it bad action wise, but not good story wise. I thought it would be like The Driver, but it evolves into Bradock Missing in Action,and then into a remake of Return of the Dragon.  Entertaining and gets rid of anger, which I needed to vent out yesterday, but I kept saying to myself you got to be kidding with some of the story.  Go see it if you like martial arts, and rocket attacks.  Notice the heat seeker goes after the warm oven, I appreciate that detail.  I give it a six out of ten."
"JackDevoe","10","0","1","14 October 2002"," The cooks made a fantastic broth!
","I thought that THE TRANSPORTERwas flowing with coolness. Jason Statham<br/><br/>made a great leading man. He had a very smooth performance. He was very<br/><br/>honorable, he never lost his cool,and another unique thing about him was that he never killed anybody unless he seriously had no other choice. It was a<br/><br/>change from other movies where the good guy just kills all his enemies. Plus, he was VERY impressive with his martial arts. He was so good at it, he could<br/><br/>probably beat Keanu Reeves in a fight. (Or even have a better chance against<br/><br/>Jet Li than he did before in THE ONE.)<br/><br/>People say Shu Qi was annoying in the film, but I thought she was cute. Her<br/><br/>performance was very fitting to her character in the film, so it6 made sense that she wasn't a confidant, Julia Roberts type of character.<br/><br/>Corey Yuen's best modern work can be seen here. He actually did a better job<br/><br/>with the action scenes here than in KISS OF THE DRAGON. He didn't even<br/><br/>have to make blatant references to his other works in this film. His ideas were much more frsh this time. It made me think of the days of RIGHTING WRONGs<br/><br/>and FONG SAI YUK.<br/><br/>Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen have also written their best screenplay<br/><br/>since THE FIFTH ELEMENT. The movie had a very European feel to it, and no<br/><br/>Hollywood fluff got in the way. One way to sum this movie up is to say that it's a French/American Kung Fu film. It's the best action film I've seen this year."
"kitral_ross","10","0","1","13 October 2002"," Best action movie of the 21st century!
","The movie was great!  I saw it opening weekend, and I admit that I was skeptical after seeing the trailer, and reading the critic reviews.  But I went anyway on October 12th, and to my surprise, the theater was full! The movie was great.  Lots of action, great acting for a action movie, and Jason Statham is quite sexy.  It's way better then xXx, and it might possibly be the Best action movie of the 21st century!  Go see this movie!"
"the_fog_1980","10","0","1","28 September 2002"," Excellent Action
","The Transporter has me wanting to see action films again. 2002 has been a pretty good year for action films, but this one just helps push the bar a little further. The action scenes are awesome. It's always good to see something a little different. This film will deliver a direct hit to the action film lovers heart. Plus the gorgeous girl helps as well. Do check this film out when it opens nation wide. Kudos all around!"
"Ephraim","10","0","1","12 September 2002"," Forget XXX... go see The Transporter
","Just came back from a preview. This is a heck of a ride! This movie reminds me of the French movies from the 80s, lots of action and lots of fun. Okay, it's been brought up to date, and now has martial arts, but it is still a wild ride.<br/><br/>Jason Statham plays Frank Martin, ex Army, who works as a ""Transporter"" who works moving goods, no questions asked. When he's asked to move a package of no more than 50 kilos, he accepts the job. On the way to make the delivery, he gets a flat, opens the trunk and sees the package, in a bag, squirming. He decides to be a nice guy and give the package a drink... a mistake he is soon living to regret.<br/><br/>There is the old police detective, snooping around, trying to find out what Mr. Martin is really doing in the Cote d'Azur. The girl, who seems to bring out the worst in him. The villain, who's trying to kill the Transporter. And finally more guys than you thought you could hire to go after a Transport who violates his own rules by looking in the package.<br/><br/>Lots of violence, very little sex, and enough adrenaline to keep your heart pumping!"
"capnmike6680","10","0","2","27 August 2002"," Pretty good
","I saw this movie at a pre-screening session they had, and I must say I was just as impressed with the action sequences as everyone else was. The plot is common Luc Bresson material. An older male who is in an illegal business of some sort, somehow is interconnected with a female and they must stick together for their sake. If you need proof of this i suggest you view Nikkiti or Leon. But even with the usual plot it still contains great action sequences and even has suspense in it. All in all a pretty good movie I'd give it 8/10."
