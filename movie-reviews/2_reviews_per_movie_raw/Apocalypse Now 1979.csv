","Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel ""Hearts of darkness"" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.<br/><br/>The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the ""heroic"" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.<br/><br/>The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.
The last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.<br/><br/>The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.<br/><br/>The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living ""hell"" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure."
"jokeco68","10","595","729","21 December 2004"," In my opinion, Coppola's best work
","My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. <br/><br/>This movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn't at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is 'Platoon' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers. <br/><br/>Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.<br/><br/>It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.<br/><br/>A little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved' version of the movie"
"ramstar22","10","223","284","14 August 2005"," The Dark Side of Man
","Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is not a Vietnam War film. Do not confuse it with one. It is set to the back drop of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. It is also one of the most audacious films ever made, produced, or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film's production levels.<br/><br/>Opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the Doors ""The End"" as Martin Sheen's Captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes. Willard's mission is to ""terminate... with extreme prejudice"" Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has invariably gone AWOL in the far reaches of the Cambodian jungle and, as told by his general, is ""out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops."" Kurtz is a delusional Colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god. For Willard, this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat, yet, the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior.<br/><br/>Teaming up with a small crew, they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz. During Sheen's raspy voice over, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. He was a normal man with a family, until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that Willard is being led. The descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away. Eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses. But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythic figure, he is drawn to the man's power and why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard's slow decay will parallel that of Kurtz's.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: unmatchable. His genius: undeniable. But for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance, Brando can be perceived, in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer, as a hack. He is most certainly not. Brando was difficult to work with, hard to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn't. His Colonel Kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity.<br/><br/>If the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than Francis Ford Coppola's actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man's fanatical struggle to produce a movie. It is reported that during the film's 200 plus day principle photography schedule, Coppola contemplated suicide. The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; it is a grueling film to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of Martin Sheen's haunted soldier Willard.<br/><br/>I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film. At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented, films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is pure film-making. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest order. But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today's standards for film: a lack of innovation. It is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today; it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart. But we still have the great ones like Coppola's masterpiece, a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend.<br/><br/>That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step into madness. The killing can disturb. The loss of innocence can unhinge. But it is the damage from within; the countless barrages of images that distress, unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual, the savage and the animalistic. If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance, the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis."
"Theo Robertson","10","449","631","23 June 2004"," My All Time Favourite Movie
","I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time . I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it <br/><br/>This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie . I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound , editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted , and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border <br/><br/>How about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but he's everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director , I said "" was "" in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head , but his sacrifice was worth it . In John Milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen , but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war . Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldn't have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes , so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension . When Coppola states "" This movie isn't about Vietnam - It is Vietnam "" he's right . What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting ( The Manson trial suggests it's 1970 ) had changed America's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of America <br/><br/>It's the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime . I've not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic . In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who's leading an injun war party , or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who's leading a resistance movement on Mars , though this is probably down to Joseph Conrad's original source novel<br/><br/>My all time favourite movie and it's very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb"
"surfisfun","10","59","76","3 January 2018"," skip Redux version, watch original first
","Top 20 war movie<br/><br/>in Redux they added long scenes that changed tempo of movie.
The one at the plantation didn't work well in context.
What a great film!"
"bob the moo","Null","31","38","27 March 2004"," Redux: still brilliant - but now with new strengths and weaknesses
","In an updating of `Hearts of Darkness' a soldier is given a mission to travel up a river During the Vietnam war in order to terminate the command of Colonel Kurtz. Kurtz is operating without orders and is leading a group of natives in brutal violent strikes against the enemy. Despite his history of brilliance and decoration he has clearly gone mad. Willard joins a military boat and travels up river to his destiny. However the further he travels the more madness appears to have become the norm.<br/><br/>That Redux was going to be anything less than brilliant was never in doubt: it was never going to be so different from the original that it would destroy or significantly damage the reputation or impact that the film has. What was in question to my mind was whether or not Coppola should have just left well enough alone.  I have seen the documentary about the making of the original film, wherein Coppola derides many of his scenes and decides to cut them out of his movie even as he finishes shooting them - the plantation scene being one of the key ones that he felt just didn't work.  It was for this reason that I was interested to see what the additions and rejigging of scenes had done to the film.<br/><br/>The strengths of Redux is that Apocalypse Now was never about the straight story, it was more about the journey Willard undertakes rather than a build up to a traditional conclusion - while the ending is big, it is no more or less important that anything that has gone before it.  So for that reason it is a good thing that, simply put, there is now more of the journey to be enjoyed!  `49 minutes of new material' my dvd cover screams at me; combine this with the movement of scenes and certainly it does have the feel of a different (albeit familiar) film rather than just a bit of spit and polish with some new CGI effects (yes ET, I'm looking at you).  However this increased material also brings with it the problems that not all the material compliments the film in terms of total quality.<br/><br/>None of the added scenes or sequential movements are bad or even average, they are all interesting, but some just don't seem to really fit.  The plantation scene has some great dialogue (that strikes a real chord so recently post-Iraq) and it makes it's points but it just didn't seem to fit. I can see what Coppola was trying to do and, if you watch Hearts Of Darkness, you can see that it frustrates him that it doesn't work, but he got it right first time, it doesn't fit despite it's standalone merits. Likewise the playboy bunny scene intrigued me as I tried to get more from the bunny's semi-speech about being made to do things and the theme of objectification, but again it didn't totally work and seemed out of place.<br/><br/>Despite these two major scenes not totally fitting, they are still interesting and, if you came for the journey, then that is what matters and they present themselves as a flawed part of that journey - but a part of that journey nonetheless.  Some of the smaller additions actually contribute a lot more to the film.  Little moments in the boat show Willard to be more relaxed as a man than the original did - and this greatly benefits my understanding and appreciation of his character.  How he interacts with the rest of the crew is also improved.  Other minor additions to existing scenes serve to enhance them, but improvement in some areas is difficult when it comes to this film.<br/><br/>I won't go into details on cast, performances and the themes of the film as I have already done that in my other review.  Suffice to say that, if you loved Apocalypse Now then Redux will likely both enhance your enjoyment and slightly irritate you at the same time.  The film easily stands up to the longer running time - as another user said, I could easily give the five hour version a stab (well, maybe once!) as the journey is the all.  The additions may not be without flaw, but then that's why they were higher on the editing hierarchy than the rest of the stuff!  However they add interest and minutes to the journey - both of which are good things.<br/><br/>Overall, it is very difficult to take `one of the best films ever madeT ' and make it better - and Coppola hasn't done that here, but he hasn't damaged it either.  It isn't a brand new film and it doesn't mess around with the original so much that it could be called a different film - so I won't compare the two as to which is `better'.  Suffice to say that, while I don't totally agree that you `can't have too much of a good thing', certainly an extra 49 minutes is gratefully received where it doesn't damage or cheapen but only seeks to enhance and support."
"sizzling_words","10","173","244","8 October 2005"," The bravest , most honest account of the futility of war ever filmed.
","During the final throes of the Vitnam war, our central character, Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is dispatched by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to assassinate a renegade US Marine commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has allegedly gone 'completely insane', but who is successfully waging a private cross-border war from his base in Cambodia, a neutral and therefore off-limits country.<br/><br/>The entire narrated story of what Willard sees and does as he is ferried up the Da Nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder Kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses, decadence and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: If we don't understand something, and we are unable to control it, exterminate it. Kurtz had eventually come to know this.<br/><br/>Unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture, to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in Kurtz's darkened lair, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle deal with his executioner, his unilateral 'surrender' in return for Willard agreeing (did he nod?) to tell Kurtz's 'son' (another metaphor for us, the next generation, the ones watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in Vietnam, is mind-expanding stuff.The bonding between the two men whilst Kurtz cross-examines Willard,--interlaced with some of his own horror stories, is incredible, nay, genius, film. The closing (intercut)scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful of symbols. Coppolla has made, intentionally or not, the ultimate anti-war statement, one that should resonate through the ages."
"Cinema_Hound","10","342","497","25 June 2001"," You love it, or you hate it....
","As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how few ,""middle of the road"" comments there are. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film. ""Why would you like a film that's so confusing?"" ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war, forget the brutality....This is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo. Brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done. They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job, he does it too well, without adhering to the accepted ""standards"" of death and destruction (Am I the only one who's troubled by the fact that we have 'standards' for death and destruction????), so they send the ""Conformity Police"" out to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm....Draw any parallels between this and things you see every day? With the deepest respect to Mr. Coppola, whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time, I think he transcended his original intent of the movie, and probably didn't even realize it until after the movie was released. The subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead, it seems to have 'grown' itself, like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a bang-up job on this entire production, as did the cast and crew, but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten-fold. So if you haven't seen the movie, rent it, watch it, then watch it again, and maybe a few more times, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film. Those of you that have seen it, watch it again with the mindset previously described. I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film. Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-telling style!"

","This movie changed the art of film making, telling a complex story in a powerful new way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke. The film uses music not as a score laid in later, but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers, radios etc. Coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration, taking scenes and characters, and putting them into entirely different surroundings. That is a tricky and brave thing to do. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune, and films him so that you can barely see his face. The pure guts that such a move requires is astounding, and it works beautifully. This movie belongs in the top ten."
"FilmOtaku","8","124","178","4 October 2004"," The horror. The horror
","'Apocalypse Now Redux', Francis Ford Coppola's war opus is probably the most beautiful war film I have ever seen. Capt. Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into Cambodia to 'terminate the position' of Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army, setting up his own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers. Escorting him up the river to Cambodia is a handful of navy men, and along the way, they encounter several interesting people (most notably is Robert Duvall's Kilgore, a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose) and some horrifying situations. <br/><br/>'Apocalypse' is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study. It is more 'Full Metal Jacket' than 'Platoon'. The running time of 'Apocalypse' is over three hours, but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived, I was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed. The beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me, however. After seeing this film, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history. The 'Godfather' films were all tinged with an almost sepia tone, and shadows created the feeling of a Baroque composition. With 'Apocalypse', there is an incredible usage of natural light, and the shadows, particularly in the scenes involving Brando and Sheen, almost become a living character, they are so pervasive and effective. Another gorgeous scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes, and come across a tiger. The sheer enormity of the surrounding foliage (leaves as big as a house) made the characters almost Lilliputian, but the colorization of the scene was incredible. While everything else was almost a muted grey, the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green, an effect that was particularly striking. Another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the helicopters carrying Duvall and company attack the small village while playing Wagner. This could have just been an ultra-dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene, but instead Coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene, with Duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to 'scare the hell out of them'. <br/><br/>The performances in 'Apocalypse' are first class. Much has been made of the amount of money Brando earned for the film, and the amount of trouble he caused. Regardless of this, he turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time. Sheen is completely outstanding - this is the first time I have seen him really unleash in a film  and Duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony Kilgore. 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture by now (most know several choice lines from the film, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' et al) but I knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience. I have not seen the original cut of 'Apocalypse Now' so I cannot compare it to this newer cut, but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced. 8/10<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","Now, it would appear by judging the user and critic reviews that my opinion is in the minority. Nonetheless, I cannot for the life of me understand the extremely high ratings for this film. The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon and Good Morning Vietnam all much more enjoyable. The cinematography of Apocalypse Now is very good at times, the opening scene being arguably my favourite part of the film as the music is perfect. However throughout the whole film I just felt an extreme lack of consistency with the storyline, too much confusion and jolting between themes. Whilst some of the action scenes were brilliant, I just felt a real lack of connection to the purpose. Now I won't spoil the ending but let's just say I really could not make heads or tail of the decisions made, all logic was out of the window. I am never usually critical of a film and this must be the highest rated picture that I really do not get on well with, for some reason I just expected a lot more and was very disappointed."
"The Claw","Null","196","298","20 April 1999"," the horror, the horror...
","So just how insane is 'Apocalypse Now'?  Well, let's say that it is the kind of film that makes you want to bang your head against the wall.  The beginning has no credits or titles; nothing.  The whole film seems like it's taking place on a different world, and as the story moves on, sanity itself is shed.  There was a French plantation scene that got cut out, and an alternate ending that would have had a massive battle scene outside Kurtz's compound.<br/><br/>'Apocalypse Now' is not a realistic film in the sense that the presentation of the Vietnam War is far from correct: helicopters going in BEFORE the napalm strikes, a USO show in the jungle at night, and the final bridge all lit-up like a Christmas tree.  (for more realistic 'Nam War movies, try 'The Deer Hunter' or 'Platoon')<br/><br/>But what 'Apocalypse Now' lacks in historical accuracy, it makes up in artistic and dramatic scripting.  Some of the best photography and lighting ever can be found here.<br/><br/>The film also raises some severe philosophical issues, and gives us entirely new ones.  When the movie begins, the war is raging around us.  It is chaotic and nerve-racking, yet still rational.  When we finally get to Kurtz's base, the action has died down, but rational thinking has long since been vanquished to the point of total lunacy.  This shows us the truth about men of war in times of war and peace.  The voyage down the river has a sense of time travel (a sense that would have been much more apparent had the French Plantation scene remained.)  And when you get to the end, keep in mind the old phrase: The King is dead...  Long live the king.<br/><br/>Is Kurtz insane?  Or are we not yet ready to understand him?  These questions and more are up to you as 'Apocalypse Now has no easy answers."

","As I stated above, I think that the 2000 version of the film ought to be treated separately. The Redux is not just a longer version. It contains two new and important scenes, and one of them, the ""french"" episode, adds a whole new touch to a classic movie, WITHOUT breaking the atmosphere or disturbing the overall picture. I remember as I saw the Redux for the first time, that my whole understanding of the war in Vietnam changed, and how I had to go to the library and get an update on a few things. Also it is interesting that Coppola chose the year 2000 for the longer Redux. My guess is that he feels that the movie is as important today as it was back in 1979. He even went to the trouble of making an excellent piece of art even better, in order to actually make all the old fans see the new stuff, and to present a whole new generation with a very controversial and strong comment on one of the most bloody wars in recorded history. The movie is thought-provoking indeed, but also it has a visually very beautifully composed screenplay. Capturing the madness and chaos of war the storyline is also filled with more or less obvious metaphors and philosophical or existential riddles. A friend of mine called it ""the most philosophical of all movies"" - perhaps an overstatement - in my opinion it is just a very good film about war and the politics of war. But I can see that there is plenty for everyone here. What I'm saying is that it's one of those movies that you are likely to hear distinctly different opinions about, and you are most probably going to think again and again about it. I've seen the Redux 5, 6 or 7 times, and it is always a puzzling experience. Highly recommended."
"Schopenhauer","Null","147","224","24 October 2001"," The horror has come true and yet we allow it to pass by us
","Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is a pure example of method filmmaking. It is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker. The art direction, editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable. What drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline, acting and inner message. The inner message evidently enough is that war is hell, or in other words, hell is war. Not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art. European filmmakers wouldn't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war. What is most interesting is that an American filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film's collaborators through the continuance of the film.<br/><br/> The plot is fairly simple and brief, adapted by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. Martin Sheen plays the role of Captain Willard, a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore. He has a mission and it is to capture a presumed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the Cambodian jungle. Throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences. The most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks. Robert Duvall's character Colonel Kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic American army brain: to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself. The children walk about the playground, oblivious to any danger. The helicopters come into view from the dawning sea; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water, we hear the helicopter's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack. Throughout the sequence we hear Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries'. It is method filmmaking. The starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing. Let's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which Sheen travels in, stop an innocent upcoming boat, suspecting them to be VietCongs and carrying artilleries. Then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity.<br/><br/> This film has its famous moment, some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen. It doesn't require any intellectual understanding, although the film is intellectually remarkable. The American soldiers in the Vietnam War jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country, aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against. It was a war gone mad, like all other wars, without purpose or dignity. It was a pure act of humanity: to destroy and restore their own greedy needs. This is a film in which there is no saviour, where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed, anger, foolishness and egoism. As Coppola once said about the film: 'This film isn't about Vietnam. This film IS Vietnam'. He was right to the date. During the current situations of the world, where they are trying to protect their own skin, the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent. It is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation. It asks for realism.<br/><br/>Enjoy."
"MovieAddict2016","10","25","33","27 August 2003"," ""The horror...the horror"" is the reality of war and its effects...
","Spoilers. This review has been edited due to word limit.<br/><br/>`The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)<br/><br/>The sentence which is as famous as `Here's looking at you, kid,' or `Are you talkin' to me?' or `May the Force be with you,' or `I'll be back,' means a little more than some one-liners. When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed. What might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re-watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame.<br/><br/>What, exactly, does this line of dialogue mean? The horror spoken of is the reality of war. The reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt. When Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) stands before the dying Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the film, `The horror.the horror.' is the realization of Willard's corruptness. He has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment. This isn't a typical Hollywood ending. In most cases a character gains something, whether it be emotionally, physically, mentally or all three. But Willard both gains and loses. He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals. And that is a shocking ending.<br/><br/>`Apocalypse Now' is Francis Ford Coppola's tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking. This film is wholly different from `The Godfather.' It is hallucinogenic, visually dazzling, and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. At first it seems realistic, and then it becomes strange, and then symbolic, and, by the end, original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare. This is not as much a film about the Vietnam War as it is a film about the war within us.<br/><br/>At first it does appear to be another war film. Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned by an Army Lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to assassinate a renegade American Colonel named Kurtz (Brando), who is hiding out somewhere in Vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves.<br/><br/>Willard carries out his mission `with extreme prejudice,' heading out on a boat along with four soldiers, including the boat captain, Chief (Albert Hall), Chef (Frederic Forest), and a very young `Larry' Fishburne (who later went on to appear as Morpheus in `The Matrix').<br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" is in a many ways a modern update of Homer's Odyssey. As our main character, Willard, carries on his journey, he meets an array of original and strange characters, including Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange fetish for surfing, and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper), whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser Jeremy Davies in ""The Million Dollar Hotel,"" one of the worst films I have ever seen. Davies failed to make any connection with an audience; Hopper does. He is like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz; he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages. In this case, he is translating Kurtz to Willard, although I'm not so sure Kurtz needs a translation of Willard.<br/><br/>Many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. ""Apocalypse Now"" has many. Kilgore descending upon a Vietnam village playing Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history. There is sharpness to it, a brutality to it, an ironic tone to it, and also a sense of playfulness. When Kilgore kneels down on that beach and says, `I love the smell of napalm in the morning.it smells like victory,' we all crack a smile.<br/><br/>I won't lie to you: `Apocalypse Now' is a strange film. It isn't exactly the easiest thing to analyze. The end may frustrate some viewers if they don't understand Marlon Brando's significant speeches. But what it all comes down to, what really matters, is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche. The horror is the realization of war and its effects, not the war itself. Kurtz says, `You have a right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me.' Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to the audience to judge. To many naïve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head. But that isn't what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to get across. By fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz has realized just how great he had it, and how bad some others had it. By walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the naïve ones, living our lives in a fool's paradise. We are totally naïve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit. By seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are, Kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something. Just how easily he could end up like the people around him. And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door. Many people think the horror is one thing. It is two. For Kurtz, the horror is the reality of how naïve he was and the reality of the war's impact upon men. And after Willard murders Kurtz, and hears Kurtz's dying words, he realizes it too. He realizes the effects of war. To see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man. And what it has done to him. The horror.<br/><br/>5/5 stars -"
"alexkolokotronis","10","66","98","24 April 2008"," Lives Up To Its Title
","From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What does push to such a high level is the: <br/><br/>The directing was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war. Most others just display and show you the horrors of war. Coppola though makes you feel confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story. This is something that I have only experienced very few times while watching a film. The writing was of course amazing too. It brought you write into the middle of the movie. It never made me bored and this movie is three hours. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm.<br/><br/>The acting was bone-chilling. Just look at Marlon Brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded, out of whack colonel. When ever I think of a crazy gone made soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando n this film you don't want to look into his eyes. Like the movie he was freakish. To me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal. It is just a wonder why these two did not get Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies, among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming. Also Duvall's character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable. Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a cliché. Also for once cameos were put into good use having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford who I both love.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best. There is nothing more I could ask of this movie with its great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and great ending. Watch and you will see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now."
"juliette-20138","9","5","5","6 May 2018"," Excellent tribute to Conrad...
","This film was incredibly well done, and the similarities to Conrad's Heart of Darkness were amazing, creating a similar message in the end. The first scene is everything: the cinematography was perfect, and The End by the Doors as the soundtrack worked eerily well. Lighting throughout the movie, especially surrounding the mysterious Kurtz (although it was needed) also worked well to establish the mood. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, we are encouraged to see that Kurtz' inhumanity likely stems from being put in a situation where he answers to (essentially) no one, where there are no rules, and where morals he thought he once had fell apart. Maybe, it is more the absence of ""civilization"" that leads to the ""civilization"" that encourages inhumane treatment. It is human nature that is at fault, not any individual or group. The encouragement of American society for Kurtz to act in this way also definitely had an effect on him, but this is also human nature in a way. Human nature includes the elite's love for power and their ability to send others off to do the dirty work as well as the quality of obedience in those ""others"". All of these are human biases, and it seems like only the people who have a great deal of self-awareness/control would be able to overcome them. Coppola's genius in Apocalypse Now encourages us to recognize that we all have darkness inside of us, but it is our ability to overcome this madness, even in the face of no authority or laws OR in the face of authority that is evidently incorrect, that is what matters. This movie, like Conrad's masterpiece, also raises the following questions: When to ""shield"" the truth? Who should do so? Does anyone have the right to do so? Should the public have full access to all knowledge? It makes sense to think that the general public is sometimes not in the position to make a good judgement call and that emotions would cloud our judgement. But this mindset is also dangerous for the people who ultimately make the call, as it places them on a pedestal that could then cloud their judgement. Hard question that we need to ask ourselves...<br/><br/>There are also apparent differences between Apocalypse Now and Heart of Darkness. For example, in Heart of Darkness, the British Empire stands firm, with Conrad seeming to respect the British Empire endlessly. With such a positive view of the motherland, the implications in Heart of Darkness in terms of England seem to be that all is not yet lost and there is some hope for mankind after all. The film is entirely different; after watching it and learning of the Vietnam war, few people would dare to advocate for the US as a solution to any problem today. This then leads us to the opposite conclusion: that America has absolutely no right to put itself on a pedestal that creates 'good' in the world. And of course, in today's view, this idea is much more realistic and applicable. I appreciate that Coppola urges his audience to recognize that America is not some heaven and also to look back on history and our mistakes. This movie was very well done, with aspects like sound and editing coming together to create a masterpiece, and raises difficult questions that we must ask ourselves."
"cristiangrecu","10","146","235","4 July 2004"," Truly a Masterpiece
","Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times (Spielberg, Copolla and others are named there). The greatest argument was around Spielberg and whether he is or isn't a great director. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician, most of his films lack depth.Saving Ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view, but its message is dull and while its very entertaining, it doesn't make you think about anything. AN is the best movie I ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things, starting from war in general, the clash of civilizations, the condition of soldier in wartimes (is a soldier a hero or an assassin? Brando says he is neither, the french lady says he is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false. But a great movie, and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments, not to solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he isn't, nobody holds the truth anyway. You can watch this movie for its outer beauty, amazing scenes, great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied. But what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can't help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary.Both Copolla and Moore tackle similar issues, but while Copolla presents matters from an outside , objective point of view, Moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary ... It is really a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like Cannes. But anyway, if you want to start to understand a little of the Vietnam war, the Iraq war, the second World War and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie, and not the other one ..."
"Quinoa1984","10","24","34","6 January 2000"," In my top five favorite films ever made
","Apocalypse Now is not only my personal favorite work by Francis Ford Coppolla, it's also one of the great visions ever put onto cinema. It makes what was horrific, strange, and ironically exciting and mysterious about the Vietnam War into this mad tale of obsession, death, loss, and the dark side of humanity. While the stories behind the production of the film made it notorious and rather risky back in 1979, it works on its own terms and represents not just Coppola's genius but others in the Zoetrope team as well. It also paints a sometimes lurid, ultra-violent, bleak and curious view of what war does to people, both in the lower ranks, the big-guns, and those who go too far ""up the river"".<br/><br/>Many have also been perplexed by Marlon Brando's performance in the film, but it's actually one of his very best turns on screen, albeit improvised and close to running off the rails. His few moments on screen (even in the somewhat unnecessary scene plopped into the Redux version) there's enough conviction in what he's saying- and what perhaps isn't said- that makes the trip down the river worthwhile on an intellectual and poetic level. And making up the bulk of the film are delirious turns by Robert Duvall (a Oscar nominated turn he should've won), Martin Sheen as the Captain with almost too much to ponder in an ever increasing state of everything but him being insane; character actors like Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest and 14 year-old Laurence Fishburne have some of the best work they've ever done. And it goes without saying that Dennis Hopper comes close to stealing any scene he's in, for better or worse, with the most to say in rambling, yet coherent words.<br/><br/>Every time I watch this film (and mostly the original version which is what first drew me in completely as opposed to the very good if muddled Redux version) I am astounded with how operatic everything is, and how the variations on the madness and chaos of Vietnam is put together. Of course one can give adulation to Coppola for this as he completed it without totally going off the deep end or possibly dying, and his talents are pulled to their richest peaks here as a storyteller and director of actors. But it can't be said enough how much I can't get enough of Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, which has in part come close to perfect for this kind of epic film. The music is perfectly eerie and insidious, with the Doors song used for one of my favorite iconic scenes in the movies (both of them). Walter Murch's editing- which apparently was what saved the film from being a four-hour disaster- makes the action move when it needs to and for individual shots to get their due. And even the production design is remarkable and, to the extent it goes to, original in its partial translation of both Conrad's fiction and the unfortunate realities of life on the river.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, in short, get off your ass and get a copy; it might cause a kind of shell-shock for a viewer after first taking it all in, but it has some of the purest, most rewarding bits of cinema ever to come out of that all-too-brief American new-wave of the 1970's."
"sulaymen","10","13","17","12 November 2009"," Never get out of the boat unless you are going all the way.
","There must be something inherent in man, something from long ago, that sits deep within us; a scary thing, frightening to those who would choose - or who are forced to - gaze at it.<br/><br/>In making this movie, Coppola must have seen this thing that is not always visible. And if he did not see it in its entirety then in what must surely be a cliché by now, he saw enough of it to allow the heart of its darkness to pulse throughout this film.<br/><br/>And just as Coppola was changed by his experience in the jungle, so too his most mysterious character. Something happened to Colonel Kurtz. Something he saw fractured his mind, the diamond bullet shattering his perceptions into a single struggle that he himself, deep within his heart, knew he was unable to comes to terms with. And this is the crux of this movie, that this journey into darkness can promise a truth so clear that it blinds you, a truth so powerful that is keeps a hold of you and does not let you go and traps you into staying exactly, exactly where you are.<br/><br/>For the critics of this film, I wonder if they would ever admit to the existence of the dark place within. Admitting it, will they discover empathy? Art - and the film maker's craft is certainly that - surely requires the observer to join forces with the artist so as to see and to experience the world from the perspective of whatever the artist has discovered. Coppola, following the path of his own film making, ensures that his central character Captain Willard, journeying deep into the jungle, deep into his heart, has his own chance to discover the horrific artistry of the Colonel."
"Offworld_Colony","10","4","4","7 February 2020"," Watching this new transfer and cut of Apocalypse at BFI's IMAX was like watching it for the first time;
","It was surprising, shocking, frightening and hypnotic; I was amazed that the film played out completely different to how I remembered it. It really is a masterclass on delivering something esoteric and meaningful and really the quintessential (as it should be) journey into the Heat of Darkness, and yet also still utterly and completely a movie, and not an experiment or a passion piece so awkward as to not be able to enjoy it just as a movie. It strikes a perfect equilibrium and harmony with its message, cultural zeitgeist, its creators (Milius and Coppola), and its inspired material.
Regarding the image, it's mind-blowing, the rich colour-timing pops and yet is seamless, and the quality of the image is used to tremendous effect on those close-ups, where the actors are looking right into you.
Regarding the cut itself I almost knocked half a star off for the plantation scene; a scene that is fine on home video, but on the silver screen breaks the pace; stalling the way on to the ending, it provides commentary to something best left to stings of dialogue and visuals and editing instead of table scenes, and then culminates with a cringe-inducing score while Willard is seduced by the French Woman. A brief dinner scene showing the generational opinions and then the opium scene would have still held the essence instead of feeling completely out of place. There's also a palpable smidge too much of Duvall.
Watching it this time, the sound effects were so ahead of their time, they are perfect, and I've never really heard the score for this movie before, this time I thought it was sumptuous; a mix of dreamlike and grounded, somewhere else; modern and timeless.
There was a pre-filmed QnA afterwards with Soderbergh which was nice to watch, but alerted me to the excellent and enlightening Coppola/Miulius 2008 interview that can now be found on YouTube which made me appreciate the collaboration and humility of the filmmakers even more.
Apocalypse is unique, it's perfect, it's powerful and important in both the human heart and cinema. It's a masterclass and the scope, amount of extras, breadth of sets, intensity of the realism; of it all speaks to a bygone era in a powerful way; the way helicopters land so close to us in a way they never could now without CGI, the destruction that connects us to the destruction of the American machine during Vietnam, it's out of this world."
"aram81","10","4","4","9 October 2019"," One of a handful of truly great war movies
","Let's get one thing out of the way before we move on. Apocalypse Now is not an accurate war movie, in a sense that it does not portray the real nuts and bolts of how a war is run. But it's arguably the most groundbreaking. No other war movie has portrayed the dualities of human nature, the absurdities of war and the psychological toll it exerts on the soldiers who fight it, more boldly than Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. And none are as visually and thematically haunting. The performances by Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall are outstanding. The cinematography is breathtaking and the action scenes are some of the best staged and most memorable in cinema history. An audacious, evocative and gripping motion picture. Coppola is better known for the Godfather but in my opinion, this is his most important work."
"RatedVforVinny","10","6","7","16 December 2019"," A cinematic masterpiece, which has never been bettered.
","The only movie in film history to be both pretentious, yet essential viewing at the same time. The helicopter raid on the ill-fated village, is simply mind-blowing and probably the best filmed action sequence (that has ever been committed to film). Francis Ford Coppola, was wise to stick with the great actors he had previously used in 'The Godfather' and 'The Conversation'; chiefly Robert Duvall, as the crazy Kilgore (of the Air Cavalry). Some stand out scenes throughout and has never really dated, like other latter 'Nam' movies such as Platoon. To be honest it's impossible to ever imagine a film of such magnitude, cost and physical endurance, being produced in today's climate, in fact it would be nigh on impossible."

","I don't rate a movie as a 10 but this is the closest I've come to doing that.<br/><br/>As someone who has watched the original, the redux and the 6 hour workprint versions, I can tell you this is the most perfect version of this classic.
Firstly with Dolby atmos and 4K,it looks and sounds spectacular on IMAX save for the first 10 minutes for technical reasons,I'm told.
This version is shorter than the redux but longer than the original at 183 minutes. But importantly, this is the most cohesive and watcher-friendly version.It is not just that some scenes were added but importantly a lot of small changes made to a lot of scenes which makes the narrative smoother and a very pleasing descent into the madness towards the end.
This version makes the entire role of Bob Duvall so so clear and perfect;Brando is given exactly the right amount of scenes and the unnecessary scene with the playboy playmates included in the redux is axed which is perfect for the movie.The french plantation scene is included but edited and added to make it so much more coherent with the story. Some scenes at the last bridge on the river are also edited to show the madness but not drag the movie down.
I cannot recommend more to buy this version for fans of this classic.This for me is a must-buy!"

","Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.<br/><br/>I still think Martin Sheen got ""dissed"" big-time in the billing, too. He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours, 17 minutes film (theatrical version). How unfair is that?<br/><br/>Sheen is fantastic in here, especially his narration, which runs throughout. It's one of the best narrations, if not THE best, I have ever heard in a movie. His voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible, nightmare-like adventure. I never fail to appreciate his work in this movie.<br/><br/>The other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes, ones I have never forgotten, such as......<br/><br/>Sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie's first scene; Robert Duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle; the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride; the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greeting the crew in Cambodia and then Brando's bizarre character. It goes on and on with strange scenes.<br/><br/>That's not to say I enjoyed everything. No, there are a few very unpleasant scenes, such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half (can't watch that anymore), an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by Sheen's young stoned-out crew, and the crew is a little too goofy at times. Then, there is the huge amount of profanity, led by way too many f-words.<br/><br/>So, there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this One thing for sure: it is a film you WILL remember!"
"adam_pittavino","10","7","9","21 October 2017"," Into the mind of madness.
","""Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable plugged straight into Kurtz"" that piece of dialogue from Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, sets the psychedelic tone for what is widely considered Francis Ford Coppola's most ambitious project. Based loosely on Joseph Conrad's novela Heart of Darkness, 'Apocalypse Now' tells the tale of decorated soldier Walter E Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando, and the frightening journey of his assassin Captain Willard. Kurtz, who has abandoned his military obligation, has recruited an army of tribal locals deep in the heart of a war ravaged Cambodian jungle. He has in every sense of the word, gone insane. Just like Willard, we know very little of his enemy Colonel Kurtz, and as he descends further towards the Colonels compound, the more he learns about him, and most importantly, himself. As the two men collide, Kurtz's rants and confessions portray a ghost of somebody lost in time and space, reeling with pain and profound hurt, as we hear tales of a renegades life that put Willard's assumed past into some sort of moral perspective. Does Willard have the guts and instinct to carry out the responsibility placed upon him? One of the reason's why 'Apocalypse now' has a lasting legacy over other Vietnam war films is not only due to its cast, but it's director Francis Ford Coppola and his desire and will to defy modern convention and deliver one of motion pictures most analyzed and lorded movies from a near flawless and revolutionary period of cinema. To say Coppola had reached the peak of his creative and artistic powers would be a mere under statement, and to acknowledge the depth and underlying detail he has outlined can not only illustrate the brilliance of his film making psyche, but position the audience in the same chaotic realm as its cast and crew. We see the fanatic struggle of Captain Willard and we see the madness of Colonel Kurtz. The other essential character is the jungle itself, just like an actor, it transforms and evolves many times through out the movie. We first see it as a harmless estuary slowly bend into a tunnel toward hell. We also see a far more primitive tug of war between Willard and the jungle, a war that can only be won and lost in his own mind. 'Apocalypse now' is not a horror movie, but it is so much more frightening. The mark of a great film is it's power to defy categorization, and Coppola's 1979 masterpiece does just that."
"preciousroi","9","7","9","5 July 2006"," Redux adds something(s),
","Many of the added scenes explain certain parts of the older edit in a more natural and complete way.<br/><br/>For Example in the Original the bit where for whatever reason, previously holing him aloof, the crew at least makes a formal attempt to include Willard by offering him marijuana. He, of course refuses and shuts the curtain so he can get drunk (emphasizing his SpecOps/Officer Status) Disassociating himself from the crew and perhaps alleviating an awkward situation, by not fraternizing to much with the men.<br/><br/>It was exactly that the inclusion of Willard (by the crew) was unanticipated and unexplained that had always bugged me when I watched the original.<br/><br/>Now in Redux the conditions above are preceded by the ""Flight of the Surfboard"". Kilgore's attitude just begs Willard to flashback to his cadet days, and ""misappropriate"" Kilgores board. (Juvenile Pranks being of the finest military traditions) In short, stealing the surfboard is not at all out of character for Willard and the scene adds a logical progression of slightly greater camaraderie leading up to the scene where he rebuffs them.<br/><br/>Also the scene where they are all hiding under the trees with the helicopters overhead. All great stuff for male military type-bonding.<br/><br/>The addition of the scenes gives the crew a reason to be more inclusive and more positive about Willard. They think mebbe hes not such a bad officer. But Willard remembers his position, and that the crew are expendable tools that he may have to use to accomplish his mission, and remains aloof and gets drunk alone.<br/><br/>Best Vietnam movie of all time. Even if it has almost nothing to do with the war in specifics dealing almost exclusively with a single fictitious CovertOps mission and a few intersecting actions (both probable fiction(Kilgore) and potentially historically accurate(the Bridge)) As to the other extra scenes I found the Playboy scene's racist comments and connotations to be important enough to include. Also continues the classist regime. Chief, the middle-class black man wants a sista(Racist or Pride? Is there a difference?) Lance is lowerclass, but hes a cute white kid. Chef is lowerclass, but hes got a certain kind of charm. Clean, the lowerclass black man is shut out. Meanwhile, Willard is off in some private quarters with the third bunny as his right as officer and procurer (I think it was his deal)<br/><br/>Best Line of the Film:<br/><br/>the Roach ""Yeah"""

","Enough is enough. And as a viewer, I can not care for the reasons why?! Godfather and Godfather II were perfect movies with true sadness and melancholia. Godfather II was an even better movie than the first Godfather.<br/><br/>Then came Godfather III and destroyed, completely destroyed the legacy of Godfather and Godfather II. The ending in Godfather II with Michael sitting alone on a bench at the lake was a stroke of genius, but then came Godfather III where Copolla allowed and old unmotivated Al Pacino to give the character Michael a completely different personality that destroyed the character of Michael in part I and II.<br/><br/>IF YOU HAVE NEVER WATCH THE GODFATHER TRIOLIGY MAKE SURE YOU NEVER WATCH PART III - Then all will be fine and you will forever love Mr. Francis Ford Coppola.<br/><br/>The first Apocalypse Now was PERFECT - SIMPLY PERFECT. THE BEST FILM EVER MADE in my honest opinion.<br/><br/>I for one particularly like the version where Kurtz compound gets bombed and burned during the end credits making you wonder if Willard did or didn't call in the airstrike... JUST PERFECT. FULL STOP.<br/><br/>Then came REDUX and destroyed the legacy of Apocalypse Now. FULL STOP. And let me tell you, the difference between REDUX and the FINAL CUT version of Apocalypse Now is simply ridiculous and therefore to me, it is no better than the REDUX version. I was watching FINAL CUT in IMAX, of course, and in the back of my mind, I was hoping that Copolla had gone back to the original version... hmm... he hadn't... hmm...<br/><br/>If you ever watched THE MAKING OF Apocalypse Now it would be much easier for you to understand what I am about to explain. Nevertheless, let me try.<br/><br/>EVERYTHING from the French plantation scenes never made it to the original version of Apocalypse Now. In THE MAKING OF Apocalypse Now we see a very angry and frustrated Francis Ford Coppola explaining the cast and crew of his film that they should all forget about this part of the movie. Erase it from their minds (not sure this were his exact words...) since he already then knew he was never going to use it. That he hated it and that it was completely misplaced in his vision of Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>For years I always wondered what he meant and what those scenes at the French plantation were all about?! Then I watch the REDUX version and finally understood what he was talking about in THE MAKING OF Apocalypse Now. The scenes at the French plantation were made to explain a political and pseudointellectual view of why wars are the unnecessary stupidity of the human race. If the audience weren't clever enough to understand the antiwar message from the original version, well then, the scenes at the French plantation would spell it out for you.<br/><br/>Also, the funeral of Clean with a torn and burned US-flag seems utterly ridiculous and misplaced together with the dreamlike short fling between Willard and the French widow. If you have watched the original version over and over again, as I did for many, many years, you will understand why Francis Ford Coppola was frustrated and angry, asking the cast and crew to forget that they ever shot those scenes. It's like if you are listening to Beethovens Fifth symphony and suddenly a romantic piece of music composed by Mozart is being played in between the movements composed by Beethoven... It just erupts the whole experience of the Fifth symphony.<br/><br/>Also, important, are the added scenes of Kilgore trying to hunt down Willard and his men because of his stolen surfboard. Ridiculous scenes that fortunately didn't make it into the original version of Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>Also, in the original, Willard never tries to befriend or become social with the crew on the boat. He is a loner doing his business in as much secrecy as possible, making the movie more dark and realistic. In REDUX and the FINAL CUT he has his laughs and tries bounding with the rest of the crew, making scenes like shooting the Vietnamese woman who runs for her puppet more unbelievable, since logically, he couldn't react like this towards his new comrades on the boat, as an example.<br/><br/>And I could continue. The scenes where they find the Bunny girls raped and drugged are also completely misplaced in REDUX, but thankfully cut out again in the FINAL CUT...<br/><br/>Had Francis Ford Coppola only had the courage to let the FINAL CUT go back to the original version. The young people of today who weren't even born back in 1979 could have experienced a real masterpiece rather than this interrupted symphony. What a complete shame Mr. Coppola - You missed a chance of a lifetime...<br/><br/>So, my final thoughts. REDUX and FINAL CUT are both BIG NO-NOs, but the ORIGINAL from 1979, in my modest, but honest opinion, STILL IS THE BEST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH.<br/><br/>FULL STOP.<br/><br/>(So, if you have never watched Apocalypse Now, then stay away from the darkness in the movie theaters and find an old copy of the original Apocalypse Now from 1979. Preferable the version where Kurtz's compound is being bombed during the end credits... and don't ever watch the REDUX or FINAL CUT versions.)"
"davidmvining","10","3","3","21 November 2019"," One of the greatest of war films.
","The Seventies<br/><br/>In terms of the 1970s of American cinema, in my opinion, the most imposing individual was Francis Ford Coppola. Beyond his own creative output, which was obviously significant, he helped foster some of the most prominent filmmakers of the generation with relationships from mentor to collaborator with people like George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Paul Schrader. He was at the center of the new movement of American cinema that we're still seeing the effects of today (most are still making movies, although generally just not at the same level of quality as when they first started).<br/><br/>But back in the seventies, Coppola was king. From '72 to '79, he made four movies. All four were nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. He won for two of them (The Conversation's loss was to his own The Godfather Part II). The second loss was to Apocalypse Now, which lost to Kramer vs. Kramer Now, I do really like Kramer vs. Kramer, but it's nothing compared to the mad odyssey into the depths of the jungle that is Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>A Difficulty<br/><br/>With the other movies on my list, I had little difficulty explaining to myself why I loved them individually. The disparate parts of each film assembled so easily together into something often beautiful that I found the experience of writing about them easy. Apocalypse Now is very different. I really see it as a work of genuine madness. Coppola went into the jungle and lost his mind on the way out, the perfect mirror of the main character's journey, and I really do feel like the movie captures that amazingly well.<br/><br/>But then that leads to the question: How does madness lead to great art? How do you read an art born of madness?<br/><br/>I think the only way to really approach it in an abstract sense. Its effect on the viewer as he watches it. There are arguments that all art should be approached that way, but I do personally feel that formal structural and character based approaches are important to both creating and taking in art, but Apocalypse Now largely forbears any formal approach. Long story short, this post is going to be messy. Let's roll!<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now<br/><br/>Rewatching the movie for this post, I was struck by something that I've seemingly never really processed before. The movie is gorgeous to look at. The colors are vibrant with the wide range of greens of the jungle and the great palate of colors that fill in the gaps. The framing of every shot is beautiful, especially around the flight of the helicopters during the ""Ride of the Valkyrie"" scene. Even during smaller moments, like when Kilgore walks out of frame, it's perfectly shot.<br/><br/>Kilgore is crouching down, talking to Willard, ending on a melancholy note, and then proceeds to stand up and just walk to the right. We never see him again. He just disappears into the war. It's such a perfect end for him, and it's done through simple and effective framing.<br/><br/>Themes<br/><br/>As with my other favorite films, Apocalypse Now isn't terribly explicit about what the movie is actually about. The closest it gets, I think, is this line from General Corman near the beginning of the film:<br/><br/>Well, you see, Willard, in this war, things get confused out there. Power, ideals, the old morality, and practical military necessity. But out there with these natives, it must be a temptation to be God. Because there's a conflict in every human heart, between the rational and irration, between good and evil. And good does not always triumph. Sometimes, the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.<br/><br/>That quote outlines the idea at the heart of the film. The conflict between the rational and irrational and good and evil. What we end up seeing during Willard trek up the river into Cambodia is the increasing madness.<br/><br/>Is that madness specific to the Vietnam War? The surface of the movie? Is that all there is?<br/><br/>I don't think so. I think that the surface is part of the equation, but also the least interesting part. As with all great art, Coppola uses the subject of his film to talk to more immediate and relatable concerns. Not much of the audience lived through Vietnam in country, but most of the audience has seen madness. They've understood obsession. They've understood being lost. They've also understood making a choice to turn back from madness.<br/><br/>The Journey's End<br/><br/>Many people consider the journey to Kurtz to be great, but once Willard actually gets there, for the movie to peter out. I disagree, the ending is my favorite part of the whole thing.<br/><br/>I believe that part of the issue people have is with Marlon Brando. It's not that he plays the part badly, but that he's pretty obviously fat. He promised to show up lean and mean to the set, but he just loved eating too much to actually do what he promised. Coppola panicked. Kurtz wasn't going to be the highly mobile killing machine as he was in the script. Instead, Coppola had to find another solution, choosing to shoot Brando mostly in shadow and turning what was supposed to be a thin man of action in a bulking heavy threat. I actually think that the combination of shadows that the man's size, along with his insane ramblings makes him a rather terrifying figure.<br/><br/>I consider the threat of madness infecting others to be a more imposing threat than a single man swinging through the jungle as some great killer, and by stripping Kurtz of the physicality of the character's original ideal and leaving him with only the madness makes the madness all that much stronger in my mind.<br/><br/>And besides, the actual death scene is fantastic, using the sacrificial bull to imply that Kurtz himself is a sacrifice, but to what? Is Willard killing Kurtz out of orders? He says no in the voiceover. I think that it's a rejection of the madness in its entirety. What solidifies that in my mind is how Willard could obviously take Kurtz's place, but he simply grabs Lance, the last member of the boat crew, and walks away.<br/><br/>In Conclusion<br/><br/>The movie is both a hard watch and an easy one. It's hard because of the inhumanity on display and the questions that it raises. It's easy to watch because of the magnificent cinematography on display and the great performances by everyone involved.<br/><br/>In regards to the two versions of the film, I've only ever seen the original cut. I actually own the Redux version (the DVD I bought years ago came with both on the same pair of discs), but I've simply refused to watch it. I'll probably do it one day. I've heard both good things (people saying that it finally completes the package of the movie and makes it great) and bad things (those saying that, in particular, the French plantation isn't worth the price of admission and doesn't add to the movie in any significant way).<br/><br/>In the end, though, this work of madness by a madman who lost himself in the jungle is one of the most significant and greatest films made. A great companion piece, by the way, is Hearts of Darkness, the movie that Coppola's wife made about the making of the movie."
"starry-2","10","3","3","18 October 2019"," 4k final cut general review of an arthouse psychedelic vietnam war era film
","This is an amazing and well priced definitive collection of one of the best films of the 1970s and perhaps of all time, the psychedelic and intense Vietnam war era film Apocalypse Now. Like the director (Francis Ford Coppola, who also directed the Godfather series and The Conversation- another best of the 70s film) said in a press conference...this film IS Vietnam. This edition consists of the recently assembled ''final cut""...which is somewhere in length between what was the Redux version and the original 1978 cut. I find it a little more fascinating and gets a little more in depth about the journey and mission martin sheen's character gets involved with. It's the best of Redux really. But what's great about this set is that it comes with all three versions on 3 separate discs so no one is left unsatisfied. It also comes with regular 1080p blu ray versions along with the fantastic unique behind the scenes documentary from 1991 called Hearts Of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. I would rate the 4k visual presentation at 4 out of 5...the elements used in the transfer to digital are a little faded and I suspect multiple sources of film elements were used to make the final cut. However the cinematography of the film is so strong and well lit that it really overshadows any generational loss or fine details issues. The use of neutral density filters in the shooting of the film is prominent and the hdr color and wide contrast reproduction is vivid and blends beautifully. What is much more amazing is the work that went into the surround sound remix for this release. The low end pulses rather dramatically and deeply and the high end fidelity is penetrating. The use of The Doors' ""The End"" song in the infamous dazzling opening shots/scenes are so mesmerizing and spacious that it gets right deep into your brain via your ears and vibrations through your spinal column. This film is reputed as one of the best sound designed films and it's true. It's one of the only films in existence whereby you can listen to the film with the visuals/tv off and still be able to get the story of the film in great detail. It's a testament to pure artistry and psychology delivery via editing of sound and picture. This goes with Thanks to the ultra genius craftsman of film overall, Walter Murch. It's hard to say which cut is better, which is great that all 3 are here in this collection. I rate this film (no matter which cut/length) a 12 out of 10. The 4k restoration is a 4 out of 5 as stated previously and the sound reproduction, Do get this if you are a fan, or just curious. It's a rare perfect movie thats immersive- delving deep into morality, 'tripping out' and of course, madness. Get some Coppola estates red wine and a nice joint and kick back to this fine fine piece of cinema. Its a keystone and testament to how a story should be told."

"robertmaybeth","10","3","3","23 March 2018"," Perhaps the most dramatic film ever made - every scene is filled with menace and impending disaster.
","Coppolla's flawed but masterfully done movie earns it's ranking on almost every top film list that matters. 3 years in the making, the finished cut (the 1979 version not the ""Redux"") doesn't reflect Coppolla's personal agony in creating this (that story is told in the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness"" by Coppolla's wife Eleanor). <br/><br/>Like every war movie, there are the inevitable criticisms of lack of realism in the events portrayed, to the tune of ""Yeah we really did a lot of surfing during fire fights, didn't we?"" But that viewpoint is perhaps improper when looking at a truly unconventional movie of this type. ""Apocalypse"" is no documentary but a metaphor for the Vietnam war itself, and comparing it to other more realistic movies such as ""Platoon"" is unfair. Coppolla clearly is going for effect here, and the extreme absurdity of the events shown are intentional and meant to elicit an emotional reaction from the viewer (and anyone who saw this film in a packed theater in 1979 will tell you, Coppolla succeeded admirably at this). This is one of the few movies that deserve (and almost require) multiple viewings, since it would be very difficult to get the full effect of the powerful story-telling going on here, and to grasp the message (the madness that was Vietnam.). It's safe to say if this is your first viewing of ""apocalypse"", it'll be like no other movie ever made, before or since.<br/><br/>In my opinion the best cut of the film to watch is the 1979 original and NOT the ""Redux"", at least for the first viewing. The Redux was released in 2001 and includes about an additional hour of footage - but most of the new footage seems pointless, is fairly ponderous, slows down the story immensely and not one bit of it adds to the plot (and in fact dilutes the story in a big way.)"
"c-36048","10","3","3","19 October 2017"," Best Ford Coppola Film, Maybe even war film
","Whenever someone talks about the best Ford Coppola film, most will tell you its the Godfather, and when someone talks about the best war film most will tell you its Saving Private Ryan. While both films, huge in popularity, are undeniably masterpieces, I personally this film surpasses both of them. To a degree its just my personal taste, I like films that are stylistic and more abstract but still engaging, but I think that it definitely needs to be considered one of the best. I know many people consider it as a classic, but according to IMDb user reviews, interstellar is a better film, and saying that is a sin. Interstellar needs to be pushed down, this one being pushed up. What makes Apocalypse Now such an interesting war film is how it handles the war it is in. The book, Heart of Darkness, isn't even set during a war, being a story on insanity. I think setting it in the Vietnam War is great, because not only does it feel familiar to the African Jungles with the natives, but it also focuses more on the psychology effects rather than the physical. I like films like Platoon, Deer Hunter, and Casualties of War, but not only do the feel quite similar in tone, but they feel like the focus on the brutal aspects of Vietnam too much to me. In the war casualties weren't high (for the American side at least) and it wasn't particularly difficult, compared to WW1 or 2. But psychologically, it was damaging, forcing soldiers to kill civilians, de humanize the enemy and eventually themselves. For those reasons that those films fail, both Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket and this film are able to ascend the typical Vietnam film, and to me, actually become poignant. I don't want to ruin any particular scene for anyone who might actually want to watch this film (YOU SHOULD) but just know that 1. The performances are all great, especially from Robert duvall, martin sheen and Marlon Brando. The film can get pretty intense, and sometimes a bit difficult to watch. The last 30 minutes or so are insane, and to me great. To me the film isn't a movie with one highlight, and then the rest not being able to top it. I love Saving Private Ryan, but it is a good example of a film where the Beach scene is so good that nothing ever tops it again, making some scenes personally not as powerful. In this film, you think nothing will ever top the Flight of the Valkyrie scene, everything is constantly proving this film doesn't just have one great scene, but is a variety of great scenes folding together with context, and a film that greatly shows the dehumanizing aspects of war. Overall this is definitely a film in my top 5, my personal favorite Coppola and war film. If you haven't seen this film, you are doing yourself a disservice."
"gab-14712","9","3","3","18 October 2017"," ""I Love the Smell of Napalm in the Morning.""
","I have many ideas and thoughts about Apocalypse Now. Based off Joseph Conrad's Hearts of Darkness, it is considered to be one of the best films of the twentieth century and one of the best Vietnam War movies ever made. I can generally agree with that assessment, but this movie is overly complicated sometimes. The movie has much to say on character and Darwinism. This movie follows Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) as he is tasked to travel downriver from Vietnam to Cambodia to assassinate a former American colonel, Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). But when Willard arrives to meet the Colonel, he realizes all is not what it really is. Kurtz has sided with the North Vietnamese for reasons of Darwinism and staying alive. He confesses how much stronger the Vietcong were than the Americans. They would go to any length to win the war and that is what gave them strength according to Kurtz. Kurtz was once one of the greatest soldiers in the American army and now after the reality of the war set in, he is taken over by madness and despair. This entire movie is about the journey Willard takes to understand what exactly Kurtz has gone through over the course of the war because Willard is going through the same ordeal.<br/><br/>This movie shows both the joy and angst of filmmaking as director Francis Ford Coppola will say. This movie was a very hard shoot as it took over four years to film. (Actor Laurence Fishburne was 14 when he began shooting, and 18 when it ended and Harrison Ford filmed his part before Star Wars made him famous..and that was two years before this movie's release). The movie was full of complications ranging from sickness (Martin Sheen had a heart attack on set) to actors being very hard to work with (Brando being Brando). But in the end, this was Coppola's baby. Sure, he had The Godfather films but this is his heart and soul. With all the trouble this film had, it is remarkable how great this film is. Coppola really makes clear what he thought about the war itself and how hard it damaged the human psyche. He underlines the hell these humans have gone through over the course of this journey.<br/><br/>One of the best supporting characters is Robert Duvall as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (he said the opening quote of this review). His performance actually earned him an Academy Award nomination rightfully so. Talking about insanity, this man only cares about surfing and beaches. He only agrees to help Willard take a beach because that beach had great waves. Plus in the Redux version (which this review is from), Kilgore uses helicopters to chase down Willard on the river because of accusations that they stole their surfboards. He also uses his choppers as he plays Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" as he swoops down over young schoolchildren. It's a little over-the-top, but I guess that fits the insanity part very well. Another fun supporting character is Dennis Hopper's role as a photojournalist for Kurtz. He is supposed to be the funnyman and he incites poetry which he clearly heard from Kurtz himself.<br/><br/>There is one thing that this film wouldn't work without and that is the opening song. ""The End"" from The Doors is an iconic tune and it has a significance in the film. I can't imagine the opening sequence of the treeline being blown away working well without this song. Also keep an eye on the Oscar-winning cinematography from Vittorio Storaro. The movie is utterly gorgeous and he created some of the most beautiful sequences in cinema history.<br/><br/>As well-liked this film is, it does have its share of controversies. Brando, whom was perfect for the role, had a salary of one million dollars (which was unheard of during its time). But there is a sequence in the movie that created even more controversy. The live killing of a cow as part of a sacrifice. Animals are supposed to be protected during movie-making, but this movie actually killed a cow for an incredibly gruesome scene. That is one scene that really appalls me due to an actual animal being killed.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is an important movie. Following the success of 1978's The Deer Hunter, it proved there was an audience for Vietnam War movies after all. It took me several tries to realize what a monumental and influential film this is. It is a very long movie, but it's a journey about how humankind reacts to the horrors of war. You see Kurtz as a villain at first, but as you come to the end of the movie, that is where we gain some sympathy for the man after everything he has been through. Francis Ford Coppola created a very important piece of art-the biggest film of his career. This is a hard movie to get through, but I think it's worth watching in the end.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-"
"rudolfsbojars","10","3","3","10 October 2017"," Truly, one of the very greats!
","Whenever a conversation regarding your favorite movies come up, without hesitation Apocalypse Now always comes forth as the primary contender. Although it took me multiple viewings until I fully started to appreciate the movie for the masterpiece that it was. That for me seems to be the only downside of most truly great films- just a few hours are given for the immersion into the lives of several nuanced characters. While the (mostly) time consuming act of reading a great novel grants the opportunity to grasp the atmosphere of the plot without having to reread.<br/><br/>While obviously the movie revolves around the Vietnam war, the historical conflict itself seems to merely be used as a background. In fact, as quite a few other reviewers have pointed out, it has barely any real connection with the actual day to day life of the American soldier during the war. Instead it is a surreal and intense character study of psychologically distinct individuals on a boat going down the same route of consecutive stages of war-induced madness. Only a select few can endure the trip deep in to the heart of darkness without on the way losing oneself to violent bravado, lust and degradation, madness or cold, detached indifference for the rest of the world. This theme becomes more apparent as the characters delve further down the river, deeper into the jungle, slowly abandoning the Vietnam theater while the film adapts a more surreal, almost metaphysical focus.<br/><br/>It certainly is one of those movies that divides an audience and to its discredit far too often is compared with other films of the same (or similar) genre. Though it is truly unique, and the fact that (at least to my knowledge) for all these years since its creation no other director has dared to emulate something which doesn't seem to have a tangible formula, speaks for its longevity."

","I'd like to get this out of the way, Apocalypse Now is not a film. Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 adventure, war epic transcends the medium of film and even storytelling itself, and becomes something else. What it is, I'm still not entirely sure; a statement on the war in Vietnam, a descent into utter madness, a degradation of civilized humans into their primal selves? It is all of these things and somehow, none of them. All i can say with certainty is that it is the single greatest statement on human nature i have ever seen.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now stars Martin Sheen as Captain Benjamin Willard, a US army veteran living in Saigon, who's experiences in Vietnam have fundamentally changed him as a person. Willard is given a mission from the higher ups in the Army, to travel upriver, from Vietnam into Cambodia.<br/><br/>A Green Beret Colonel named Kurtz,played by Marlon Brando, appears to have lost his mind fighting in the war and has led the rest of his unit, along with a number of local tribesman, deep into the jungle. There he resides as their ""God"".<br/><br/>As Willard travels upriver, his journey becomes a dreamlike nightmare, consisting of surreal and haunting sights that force Willard and the others on the boat to confront their own nature as humans.<br/><br/>The film has the best Cinematography i have ever seen in a film, with beautiful yet disturbing visuals and superb sound design. All actors give excellent performances, especially Sheen, Brando, and Robert Duvall who plays the flamboyant and ruthless Colonel Kilgore.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is both my personal favorite film of all time, as well as, in my opinion, the greatest film ever made. This film should be required viewing for all, you owe it to yourself to watch it."
"agmuradov","10","3","3","4 July 2006"," I love the smell of napalm in the morning
","I decided I need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film. Unlike other war films that focus on the event, Apocalypse Now takes the viewer into a psychological head trip. The sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, yet you can't lay your eyes off of it. Based off of Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, Apocalypse Now slowly descends its protagonist, Willard (Martin Sheen) into madness, most likely the same way Kurtz plunged into insanity. The production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for Brando's unprepared performance (he read his lines from cue cards). There is a documentary titled Apocalypse Now: A filmmakers Apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making this.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any film. As the blade of the helicopters are heard in slow motion and napalm is dropped in the trees, the song ""The End"" by the Doors can be heard. The next shot is of Willard in his bed with the fan on, so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan. We are informed that he does special missions for the military, mostly assassinations. When his next mission is given to him, he is baffled. ""Charging a man with murder here is like giving a speeding ticket in the Indy 500."" The man he has to kill was a respected colonel that has gone insane and isolated himself along with tribes people. Kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and he must me stopped. Willard does not go alone however. He is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across several battles. Along the way, they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore ""Hoorah"" about the war. Willard ponders that if Kilgore is that crazy, what could Kurtz be like. There are many scenes that portray Willards plunge into insanity: The tiger attack, the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese, the nonstop rain, the piled dead bodies scattered about, and the deaths of his crew members. When he reaches the Kurtz compound, he is greeted by the village people and a hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of assassinating Kurtz right away, Willard begins talking with him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do. Kurtz, on the other hand wants to die. He is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier. Willard kills him with a machete while in unison, a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people. Once they realize their leader has been slain, instead of killing Willard, they hail him as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves them.<br/><br/>The cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking. The colors are grain free, something that is rare in older movies. I can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenery.<br/><br/>The acting ensemble is terrific, with everyone playing their parts well. Many criticize Brando for some reason, but I think he nails his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten up by the war.<br/><br/>The soundtrack and the score are haunting, and provide the mood for the film. I am wondering what instrument they used in that guitar-like sound when the credits roll? There have been many parodies of this film, but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot: ""Your character provides comic relief for the show, like um, Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now."" Those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious."
"EdgarST","10","3","3","2 July 2006"," Coppola's Masterpiece
","Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance, open-mindness, and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the United States has ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the American political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the increase of violence and death in the streets...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare, be different, and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures. Coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making, following the parameters of war and adventure films, and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life, the reason of death, or the ethics of war. It is also a passionate work, made against all odds, chronicled in the 1991 documentary ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse""; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam war ever to reach the screen. This may not be the definite Vietnam motion picture, but dealing with it Coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two Vietnam movies made simultaneously, ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Coming Home"", or in latter ones as ""Platoon"" and ""Casualties of War"", before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre, as horror in ""Jacob's Ladder"", or comedies as ""Good Morning, Vietnam"", among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war."
"Jcombat","9","3","3","2 July 2006"," A superb exploration of both film and literature.
","First of all, I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"", the book that was the literary basis for the movie. With that said, I believe that this movie is astounding. It is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict, but more the psychological toll that it took on the young, inexperienced ""kids"" who were sent to fight it. Coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making, using many visuals to help tell the story. The acting I felt was definitely all-around up to par. Marlon Brando's part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting. His elucidation to Willard at the end of the film reels you in, and reveals the hollowness of a man that you've heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie. Those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film, because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all. In my opinion, this is one of the most sculptured and best-made films of all time."
"jesssellers","Null","3","3","13 March 2006"," A highly recommended film, but don't bother if you're not prepared to put some thought into it!
","Apocalypse Now is quite possibly one of the best films i have seen, that is after watching it numerous times. In order to really appreciate it i would highly recommend reading Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness as this is the novel the film is based on.<br/><br/>The film has depth and the more times you watch it the more you pick up on. Martin Sheen plays a diamond role as the narrator. What makes it such a clever role is that we are never sure whether the narrator is trustworthy or not, or does he become affected by whats happening around him? A question that is difficult or impossible to answer, you really have to trust your own instincts whilst watching this one. As for the slightly unreal war simulations, the simple answer is that they are of no consequence. The real point of the film is the focus on Marlon Brando's character and 'The horror' that is when one looks into the abyss of nothingness. The nothingness that is life when you try to become your own God, the ultimate question that arises is of course; is there a difference between a good or bad God? If you become that God then there is none but yourself to judge you."
"Cloud20","Null","3","3","4 February 2006"," An ugly, uncompromisingly brilliant look inside of mankind and the war within themselves...
","Apocalypse Now (1979, 2001) <br/><br/>Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Albert Hall, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford.<br/><br/>Twenty-five years ago, Francis Ford Coppola had created a ground-breaking masterpiece. It was called 'Apocalypse Now'. It was based on the novel Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, which was written in the late 1800's. It obviously wasn't about the Vietnam War, but instead was about a man named Kurtz in the jungles of Cambodia. Now that was a great example of film-making. Three years ago, they released an extended version called 'Apocalypse Now: Redux'.<br/><br/>Captain Benjamin Willard is a man just waiting and urging for a mission. He is assigned one: To terminate (...with extreme prejudice) Kurtz, a former Colonel who is a leader of a tribe in a Cambodian jungle. Willard travels with a group of soldiers: Chef, Chief, Lance, and Clean. He meets surf-crazed Lt. Col. Kilgore, who leads the military during an island attack. When Willard arrives on Kurtz's island, he finds that Kurtz has set up his own army. While learning about why Kurtz despises the war, Willard drifts further and further from reality.<br/><br/>'Apocalypse Now: Redux' gives us a version of the original with more detail. I thought that the original was outstanding, but adding almost an hour (49 minutes to be exact) of more footage made the film drag a bit.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, especially from Sheen and Duvall. Brando gives a good performance. This wasn't his best performance (Last Tango in Paris and The Godfather come to mind),but it was very chilling. Other familiar faces include a very young Laurence Fishburne (18 years old!), Dennis Hopper, a younger Harrison Ford, and a cameo by R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) as a helicopter pilot. Duvall and Hopper give good comic relief. Coppola's direction is very good. Probably his best.<br/><br/>The picture on 'Redux' is restored and looks better than ever. At times, I don't really consider it a war film because it doesn't focus on the Vietnam War. My favorite is the original, but watching 'Redux' was interesting. Fans of the original won't be disappointed by the film, even though we get no special features on the DVD but a trailer.<br/><br/>'Redux' only has a few scenes added in. But they are long scenes. They don't really add much to the story, and don't have much meaning. However, it is good that they made a new version, to remind us of how good the original version was twenty-two years before.<br/><br/>'Apocalypse Now' was one of the best films made about war. It is more like an anti-war film. It is like a personal journey to hell. It shows the power of a man, and how it effects others. It is one of the most unusual, brilliant, and yet bizarre films that I have ever seen. 'Redux' gives us a better look through Willard's adventure to keep his sanity. An excellent achievement (for both versions). 5 stars out of 5."
"m_lee34","9","3","3","21 January 2006"," Unforgettable
","Breathtaking at it's best, intriguing at it's worst, Francis Ford Coppala's groundbreaking epic 'Apocalypse Now' is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century, and in my opinion, the greatest ever film depiction centered around America's involvement in Vietnam.<br/><br/>What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. Growing up as movie buff, and with a particular interest in war films, I've seen many films, which have attempted to portray the 'images' and 'feelings' of Vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so. Films such as 'Hamburger Hill' and 'We were soldiers' fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam by depicting 'heroic battles' which are, more often than not, tainted by the zeal of Hollywood film production.<br/><br/>In 'Apocalypse now' there are no battles, no heroes or villains, there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the imagery of Vietnam through the physical aspects of war. Rather, it is a film, which powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute 'horror' of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century.<br/><br/>The sheer brilliance of the acting (in particular the interpretation of taciturn Captain Willard by Martin Sheen), along with the spectacular cinematography (filmed in the Phillipines), which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film, makes 'Apocalypse Now' an unforgettable epic.<br/><br/>Evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a maelstrom of mediation, 'Apocalypse now' is not for the light-hearted moviegoer. It is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated."
"stefan-reindl","9","3","3","18 January 2006"," Just as much a war movie as it is a film about society
","It is the height of the Vietnam war, and the burnt out Captain Willard finally has a new mission; a mission that ""does not exist  nor will it ever exist"". He is to travel up the Nung River into Cambodia in a U.S. Navy patrol boat and assassinate, Colonel Kurtz, a renegade Green Beret operating independently and staging hit-and-run attacks against the Viet Cong who has set himself up as a God among the Cambodian natives. The U.S. Army believes Kurtz has gone completely insane, but Willard soon discovers the Colonel's bright past. As Willard and his crewmates slowly crawl up the river, with many horrific and strange encounters, more is revealed about Kurtz and Willard slowly becomes more and more like the man he was sent to eliminate.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen puts up an incredible performance as Captain Willard, providing insights into the true nature of the film, but Marlon Brando (Colonel Kurtz) steals the show the minute he appears on screen. Brando is perfect for the role of the eccentric genius and is a foreboding image on the screen. Just as in The Godfather, Brando plays the ruthless patriarch figure very well.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now derives its artsy, abstract feel and look from the brilliant directing of Francis Ford Coppola and the eye of academy award winning cinematographer Vittorio Storaro. From the lengthy cross-fades and the strategic placement of scene changes to the long dialogue shots and extreme close-ups. Coppola is a master at using lighting to create a mood. In particular, the lighting within Kurtz's ""palace"" creates an incredibly eerie feeling.<br/><br/>With the help of the money made from The Godfather and The Godfather: Part Two, Coppola was able to create some fantastic and horrifying scenes, the most prominent of which involved numerous helicopters, hundreds of extras and thousands of real explosions. It is during these scenes that the viewer becomes aware of the satirical nature of this film.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is just as much a war movie as it is a film about society. This film examines how society treats people who operate outside of what is considered the norm. Kurtz was an extremely well respected soldier who simply began doing things his own way. The Army deemed his ways unacceptable and marked him for assassination. When you watch this film, perhaps not the first time but maybe on the second or third time, you will begin to draw the parallels between the surreal story of Captain Willard and Colonel Kurtz and the realities of modern society."
"esmee-3","10","3","3","11 January 2006"," My favorite picture
","I've seen this movie at least 20 times and still I find new and interesting details every time. The acting by Martin Sheen is superb; especially the very intense beginning where you see him in his hotel room. I don't understand why he hasn't been given an Oscar for this performance. The story is very thrilling and captivates the imagination so that you can really feel the heat, hear the sounds and even smell as if you were there yourself. This movie is not at all nice and easy to watch but is well worth the effort of giving it a couple of hours. If you have the chance, I would advise you to go and see it in a proper theater. Again in the very beginning of the film you then cannot help but be captivated by the best combination of sound (the song The End by The Doors ) and cinema I've ever encountered. I hope that in seeing this movie you'll have a great experience.<br/><br/>The storyline: Captain Willard is sent on a mission by the US army in the Vietnam war to terminate the command of a Colonel gone insane."

","Masterful. How do you tell who's sane and who isn't when the troops and the officials are all in the war for the wrong reasons? It's a giant cover-up, like the whole affair tried to be and should have been, for the good of the ordinary person's conscience. It's not a movie, it's an experience. They weren't just goofing off in front of the camera, they lived this; and the arduous shoot became a reference point for future troubled productions. The sacrifices were worth it, though; because the end results are nothing short of stunning...<br/><br/>I never understood all the hype around Marlon Brando before I saw this. In ""The Godfather"" he didn't seem to be stretching himself; but he blew me away here. He's not alone; as an acclaimed cast and director joined together to make not just the finest Vietnam movie ever made; but a work that is easily one of the best films of all time, in its own right."
"russell100uk","9","3","3","5 October 2005"," Cinematic Art
","Apocalypse Now is a movie bordering on a masterpiece, created using a canvas even the most legendary painter would be envious of. The striking elements of the film are the exceptional usage of colour, the clever manipulation of lighting and the start contrast of each and every frame. Marvel at the picture postcard presentation of the jungles of Vietnam, before suddenly all hell breaks lose and it becomes a torrent of machine gun fire and blood. Apocalypse Now aims for the gut and skewers the viewer, assaulting the senses with a masterful display of cinematography, lighting and direction. Unlike so many ""Hollywood"" productions of today, ""Now"" is a labour of love, each frame expertly crafted by a man at the very pinnacle of his film-making career. Very few films would be right at home next to a Monet or a Van Gogh, yet this is one of the few exceptions, displaying some of the most beautiful photography ever seen on the silver screen.<br/><br/>While the look may impress, ""Now"" is rendered complete by its phenomenally powerful story, based on Joseph Conrad's novel ""Heart of Darkness"". The full horror of war is explored to the depths, with the absurdities of war emphasised by the central plot of eliminating the enemy, not the Vietcong rebels, but an American Colonel with delusions of grandeur. The movie takes many unexpected twists and turns, always flirting with the bizarre and surreal, and always coming off as a fresh and invigorating slice of life behind enemy lines. Martin Sheen is superb as Captain Willard, a man who knows no other world, who lives and breathes war. Brando is suitably chilling as Kurtz, the object of his mission, and Dennis Hopper, as a hippy photojournalist, gives a typically neurotic turn, converted by Kurtz's seemingly infinite words of wisdom. And who could forget Robert Duvall, as the gung-ho Lieutenant Kilgore, lover of Wagner and napalm.<br/><br/>""Now"" is a remarkable film, a breath of fresh air amidst PC modern day film-making. Even 26 years on, its impact is spellbinding and its message is timely. Coppola, as a filmmaker, should be applauded for having the courage to make a movie about the truth and not a fabricated Hollywood tale where the true horrors and inhumanities of war are neatly swept under the carpet. I doubt we'll see another war movie of its calibre for a very long time to come."
"lostinspacesince88","10","3","3","9 September 2005"," Not really a war movie at all
","Any who have seen Apocalypse Now should consider seeing Apocalypse Now- Redux, as it further develops and clarifies the themes of the film. Although it can come across as being extremely confusing or difficult to understand, I think it is all much clearer when it is not viewed as a war film. (Keep in mind it is based on Conrad's, Heart of Darknes, which has little to do with war). Rather, it is a film about the corruptibility and weakness of the human psyche.<br/><br/>As Willard and the crew travel further up the river, and become increasingly isolated from the framework of society, the adornments of civility and moral standards begin to fall away, revealing a primitive and immoral heart in each of them. This is further reinforced by the American photojournalist in Kurtz' compound.<br/><br/>If you closely examine the film, you will see that it is not a war film, but a film about the darkness and the struggle between ""the ration and the irrational, between good and evil"" that exists in every human heart.<br/><br/>Apart from all that, it has got to be one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen!"
"barnabyrudge","10","3","3","1 August 2005"," A hugely important and hypnotic film, like a compelling nightmare from which you cannot awaken.
","Apocalypse Now is a stunning film on many levels, and a film that reverberates long after the viewer has come away from it. Visually remarkable, thematically frightening, filled with haunting and dream-like sequences that show the horror and insanity of war in intense detail, it is a film that can be watched and re-watched endlessly without ever failing to throw up new surprises. It was greeted with huge controversy when released in 1979, and almost thirty years on remains as powerful an experience. One thing that has altered over the years is the critical reaction to Marlon Brando's performance as the renegade Colonel Kurtz. Initially, Brando's performance was heavily criticised for being impenetrable and inscrutable (it didn't help that he arrived on set overweight and unprepared), but over the years the cleverness of his interpretation of Kurtz has become more apparent. Kurtz is a man alternately psychotic and eccentric, and always dangerous, and in retrospect Brando's bizarre approach to the role captures the character's insanity quite ingeniously. Those who complain they cannot understand what Kurtz is talking about in the film's final scenes are missing the point - he is lost in his own phantasmagoria and we are not meant to understand his demented ramblings.<br/><br/>The story, an updated and relocated adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, deals with an emotionally-scarred Special Services soldier, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), who is instructed to travel upriver into Cambodia on a highly dangerous mission. It seems that a once brilliant colonel, named Kurtz (Marlon Brando), has retreated into the deepest jungle and formed a private army of Montagnard warriors. Quite mad, yet totally influential, Kurtz sends his loyal followers on horrific genocide missions and lords over them like some self-appointed God. Willard's job is to find and eliminate the colonel, an unsound and embarrassing thorn in the side of the American war effort. On his perilous journey to Kurtz's lair, Willard undergoes various surreal and horrifying adventures, the most remarkable of which is a helicopter attack on an enemy village led by the deranged Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who likes the play The Ride Of The Valkyries on loudspeakers during his airborne raids because ""his boys love it..... and it scares the hell out of the gooks!""<br/><br/>The film was a real ordeal to make. The shoot in the Phillipines spiralled over budget and took an unprecedented length of time to complete. A typhoon destroyed much of the equipment and the sets; Sheen suffered a near-fatal heart attack despite only being in his 30s. But the decision by Coppola to make the film under such authentic conditions, with no studio filming or special effects trickery, ultimately pays off. This is war like never before seen on film. Nihilistic, horrifying, destructive, pointless, perversely exciting and shockingly brutal. The much-criticised ending, with its heavy symbolism and (pretentious?) ambiguity, has frequently been viewed as the film's main flaw. But in all honesty, was there any other way to end a film of this nature? Would a nice, neat ending in which the loose ends are tidily tied together really fit in a film which goes so far out of its way to blur conventions, morals and reality? Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece - a challenging, unflinching, thought-provoking journey into the heart of darkness which asks many disturbing questions but refuses to yield any easy answers."

"RNMorton","10","3","3","27 February 2005"," I love the smell of napalm in the morning.....
","It smells like......victory. I wasn't there in Vietnam, just a tad too young. I guess it would be possible to do a movie about that war that displays its insanity better, but I certainly haven't seen it. Martin Sheen and crew of small PBR gunboat are sent deep (and I mean DEEP) into the unclaimed jungle to terminate renegade U.S. Army officer Brando. With each mile they travel civilization moves further and further away. Surrealistic film style captures perfectly what must have been the hell of Vietnam in-country (or any other kind of) service. Duvall is memorable as arrogant air cav officer obsessed with surfing even in the midst of bloody shore assault. Sheen (who I think suffered a heart attack during the filming) is Oscar-caliber as an ordinary guy just trying to do his damn job in the midst of bedlam, and Hall does well in role of stoic gunboat chief. As much as anything this movie turned the post-war attitude of many, like myself, who thought at the time that we should have been there. When you go this far out on a limb there are going to be some hits and some misses. Brando and the movie's final episodes are pretty much of a miss (Hopper makes it bearable), but the rest of the movie is so damn good it almost doesn't matter; the trip rather than the destination is the big story. I initially had problems with the Redux version as it adds to an already mammoth running time, but I've gotten to like very much the French colonial sequence and also Duvall's surfboard search. There are few moments in cinema that top Sheen's monologue inner voice talking about his mission and Kurtz on his way into the jungle. Another of those movies I feel like I lived, in this case its unpleasantness (that I also live with) keeps me from stopping by too often."
"rightwing_redcoat","9","3","3","3 February 2005"," One of the best films I've ever seen!
","I had waited a long time to see this movie, and when I finally got my hands on the DVD, it was with bated breath that I began to watch it. I was kind of worried, though; I had been so excited to see it, I figured that disappointment from such high expectations was inevitable. However, I was wrong, and I've never been so happy at having been wrong in my life. From the moment ""The End"" began to play over the images of the jungle, napalm, and helicopters, the movie had my rapt attention, and did not let it go until it was done. This is a brilliant, well-acted, and masterful movie. The story is intriguing, the sound track haunting, the action sequences savage and intense, and the effects above what are in many of the movies nowadays. Most movies only have one or two memorable scenes. Apocalypse Now has dozens, but probably my personal favorite is where Colonel Kilgore attacks a village with his helicopter fleet to surf their water. About 20 choppers swoop in, blaring Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" (yes, you read that right) and all but level the village. It sounds vile, and it is, but one look will tell you why it is genius. Colonel Kilgore is without a doubt my favorite movie character of all time, and the other major characters such as Captain Willard, Colonel Kurtz, and others rank on my Top 20 at least. My one and only complaint about this movie is that in the Redux version, there is a scene with gratuitous nudity, that was completely unnecessary. In my opinion, Coppola should have simply left it out. Despite my fanatical praise, this is not a movie for children. There is over 90 f words in it, some very surreal and graphic violence, along with about 5 minutes of bare breasts in one scene. Additionally, the whole atmosphere of the movie is eerie and disturbing, and probably should not be for children. Regardless of objectionable content, however, this is a masterpiece, and, in my humble opinion, the best film of the '70s, easily. Go watch it- you'll have the time of your life!"

","This is the most ""emotional"" film I have ever watched. I do not mean in the sense that it made me cry for hours, but I meant that it had so much substance to it. The film follows Captain Benjamin Willard as he is sent up a river into Cambodia during the Vietnam war to assassinate a Colonel (who has gone insane). From the very opening scene (which shows a jungle being immersed in napalm) to the very last moment, you are completely engrossed. This film has elements of comedy, violence, gore, and (in the redux version) some nudity. Needless to say, this film has had good reviews and is a very famous war film. It must be said, however, that this film is not for the squeamish. It is not over the top in gore (like the Kill Bill movies) but it does have some very graphic violence in it. This said, I enjoyed the movie very much but don't expect to make any plans on the day you watch it (the redux version is 3 hrs and 20 min long or something like that).<br/><br/>I have seen both the original and the redux and thought that both were excellent. People with shorter attention spans probably shouldn't watch the redux version. Nor should they really watch the original either, most of the beauty of the movie will fly over their heads like a 747."

"axiom-3","10","3","3","2 November 2004"," One of the greats
","As Captain Willard lays on his bed and watches the fan blades spin round, it triggers off memories of the helicopters and a past mission that he was once part of. It is this extremely effective and entrancing opening sequence that quickly establishes Apocalypse Now as a movie for the mind.<br/><br/>The viewer is taken on a strange journey up the river to meet an enigmatic figure known as Kurtz through the eyes of Willard (as narrator). On the journey we gain an insight in to the many dark facets of war and the effect that it has on one's humanity. Whether it be the insanity, the humour, the surrealness etc. It all comes across very effectively, with the characters in this film refreshingly real and the dialouge pertinent and on occasion genuinely funny.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now does not make the mistake (as many other war films tend to do) of manipulating you into thinking a particular way, rather it is open-ended enough for you to draw your own conclusions. We are made to feel part of the crew and witness as they do and to have our own perceptions on the events as they occur. I tend to see a movie not that one watches, but experiences.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film are amazing. The cinematography is breath-taking with each scene exquisitely detailed both visually and sonically. The use of natural light in many scenes is superb (such as the mango sequence) while the music highlights the mood perfectly (The Doors was a perfect choice for the opening). The action sequences were superbly edited, especially the helicopter attack sequence coupled with Wagner blaring in the background which adds to the thrill of that scene.<br/><br/>Not a completely realistic film, but I don't believe that that was the vision or the intent. If you crave realism, go rent Platoon as a companion piece to this. When I first saw this film (which wasn't that long ago) I knew it would be one the greatest films I'd ever see just from the first 5 or so minutes. It's a far-reaching film that delivers on all counts."
"frankwhat","10","3","3","12 September 2004"," One of the Greatest!
","There's really no other way to say it except that this was a spectacular movie. Everything about it was just so perfect...the acting, cinematography, music/scores, directing, and action sequences just to name a few. I mean film doesn't get much better than this and the fact that this escaped with only a couple Oscars completely baffles me. Some classic quotes were also spewed throughout the duration and it really makes you think about a lot of things. Robert Duvall was probably my favorite character even though he was only in it for a smidge. I couldn't believe Laurence Fishburne was only 14 when he was in this, he looked a lot older. Martin Sheen was spectacular and believe it or not I think he did a better job than Harvey Keitel would've in this role (even though I'm one of his major fans), so when he dropped out I don't consider that to be a tragedy by any means. Marlon Brando is just Marlon Brando and despite all the problems he gave everyone before and during shooting I still really liked him in this role. As for Dennis Hopper, well he was very comical. This is hands down a classic and an absolute must-see!<br/><br/>Final Recommendation:<br/><br/>Movies : Man I wish I could've seen this on the screen.<br/><br/>DVD Purchase : I have ""Redux"" and it was a good investment, though the added scenes are kind of slow moving they still add a lot to the story.<br/><br/>Rental : We all got to get started somewhere."

","I'm almost embarrassed that as a big movie fan I had not seen this title sooner so I finally rented it and decided to see what it was all about. I went into it expecting a good film as just about all of Coppola's are but what I found was an incredible experience that takes you straight into the hearts and minds of the actors. I think the two keys to the film's success in the sense of pulling the viewer in is its acting and the cinematography.<br/><br/>Firstly, the cinematography is absolutely masterful and shows Coppola's supreme understanding of the camera. The shots which I was most enthralled with were the POV shots from the boat is which as the viewer you would feel like you were on the boat, being pushed through the smoke and humidity. At times I almost felt as if I was on a theme park ride, something like Universal's Jurrasic Park ride, it gave that much of a feeling of putting you in the point of view of the actors and their situations. I also liked his use of rack focus shots where during conversations he would use the technique rather then adding more unnecessary cuts. Really a supreme example of cinematographic mastery.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting was outright incredible, Martin Sheen completely played his roll down to the nuances and was backed up by a seamless cast pinnacling with Marlon Brando. Definitely felt for them to the point where when they greeted someone, I almost nodded my head with them. This could only have happened through the superb acting and cinematographic POV. Definitely one of the great films up there with the Godfathers!"

","Knowing little about Apocalypse Now bar it being set during the Vietnam conflict, I viewed the Redux version with a completely open mind.<br/><br/>
Having journeyed through a 3 hour 15 minute epic I can only say this really is as breathtaking and brilliant a movie as I'd been led to believe.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen is Captain Willard, a soldier stationed in Saigon after various missions in Vietnam. Holed up alone, he is picked to undertake an assassination mission of the reclusive Colonel Kutz, played by the ever-marvellous Marlon Brando. Getting to Kutz will not be easy, such is the isolation he's ended up in deep in Cambodia. The mission is based on the fact the American army believes Kutz to have become insane, and commanding armies on the wrong side of the war. 'His methods are unsound'. Willard must infiltrate Kutz' army and murder the man himself.<br/><br/>However, to say it will be an epic journey is an understatement of some magnitude and summing it all up is practically impossible.<br/><br/>The many strengths of this movie result in a level of depth which is quite flabbergasting. The acting is absolutely outstanding and incredibly convincing. We undoubtably care about the characters such is the warmth and affection with which they are portrayed. Even the lesser-featured characters are vastly significant in their own right, such as Robert Duvall's gung-ho Kilgore - he loves the smell of napalm in the morning. And then there's the spaced out but endearing photographer, played by the energetic Dennis Hopper. Similar character to who he was in Easy Rider, but more exaggerated here.<br/><br/>Then there is the quite superb direction/cinematography. Each scene has an amazing amount of life within it, with camera work which has to be seen to be believed. Some of the shots are just astounding, either encompassing impressive scale battle, or more humble close ups. I don't quite know how Ford Coppola did it, but this was a masterstroke and a lesson in filmmaking.<br/><br/>A review of Apocalypse Now would be empty without mention of the enigmatic Brando. Every scene he is in he steals just as he did in the Godfather. The man was the human embodiment of the brilliance of cinema, and while he's not on-screen for a massive amount, he still becomes by far and away the most important and intriguing character in the entire tale.<br/><br/>To summise, Apocalypse Now is everything a movie needs to be; gripping, dramatic, intruiging, exciting and personable. <br/><br/>One of the all time greats? Without doubt."
"verser-1","Null","3","3","26 July 2004"," Not your average ""blood-and-guts"" war film.
","Caution! Spoilers within the review.<br/><br/>Most assuredly the best war film I have ever viewed before. Containing more than the average war flick, with the ""standards"" of excessive gore, poor acting, and a lack of a plot or conclusion, Apocalypse Now is something a recommend to anyone who wants to commit a few hours to a good film. The movie transcends the aspect of pure combat in a war film, and shows us not a war against an enemy, but against our inner-selves. <br/><br/>The movie begins in a dreary, dim-lit, motel in Saigon, with our main character, Captain Bloom, who has already been mentally stained by the trauma of war in his first tour of duty. After being ""escorted"" out of his room, he is briefed by command that he is to undertake a ""non-existant"" mission to assassinate a once top-notch colonel who went psychotic and took his troops to the middle of the Cambodian wilderness. Bloom accepts this (outlandish) mission, and after a brief run in with the care-free ""Air-Calv"" and a Playboy Bunny performance at a base, they proceed to spend idle hours on their river-boat, becoming increasingly edgy and ... mentally detached. <br/><br/>Then the most memorable part of the movie begins. They arrive at the eastern-most base on the river, and is a ""hell-on-earth."" Soldiers at the base attempt to swim to the boat, pleading to be taken aboard so they can return to civilization. Flares and artillery fire are sprung about, and the soldiers are psychotic, and spend their time shooting at soldiers that do not exist (AKA: air). A ""carnival-like"" music blares in the background, which complements the carnival lights that illuminate the bridge.<br/><br/>After they depart, they pass lands of mist, riverbanks with a scattered account of dead soldiers and downed aircraft. They then run into a French estate, filled with bitter Frenchmen, and soon after see their destination.<br/><br/>It is reminiscent of an Aztec village (without the pyramids), with scattered naked corpses about, and naked soldiers who look like tribal savages and Cambodian lackeys. The target (the Colonel played by Brando) awaits Bloom, and imprisons him, while decapitating one of his crew. They then make an incredibly long and drawn out discussion, in which Brando spews out random gibberish on the workings of life, which make no sense (remember he's psychotic). Bloom finally assassinates Brando with a machete, and walks out of the place back onto his boat, while Brando's men worship Bloom for killing Brando. Bloom and one of his crew mate (a famous L.A. surfer in the plot), are the only survivors, and sail away on their boat.<br/><br/>8.5/10. Not a ten because it was rather long and drawn out at times (especially if you watch the redux version)."

","Francis Ford Coppola needed only the simplest of plots and a motion picture's ability to lengthen a river, make a jungle denser, and expound upon a character's sense of isolation to create one of the most chilling experiences on film in history.<br/><br/>*This summary may contain spoilers*<br/><br/>Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent upriver into Cambodia on a mission to seek out and destroy one Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a US military commander who has long since abandoned his ties to the American government and conducts his own war. We see later that his ""war"" is raging within himself; he is trying to save some part of his identity while entirely breaking himself free from the evil he sees in humankind, that has laid itself bare in the conflict in and on Vietnam.<br/><br/>From the outset of Apocalypse Now, we, the audience are made to see that although it sounds as if Kurtz is a dangerous individual and the movie's villain, more doubt is cast over the American command.  Willard wonders why someone with a perfect military record would give up a chance to be general, to be in a position of great admiration and respect to slip into the shadows of Cambodia.<br/><br/>This doubt grows as Willard is assigned to a boat to be led to the river by the air cavalry under Col. Kilgore, a man so sane in the face of the deadly jungles that he appears more insane than anyone else, especially Kurtz. Kilgore has barbecues for his men, blasts a Vietnamese village (where children are seen playing) just so that his men can surf, and says he loves ""the smell of napalm in the morning.""<br/><br/>As Willard and the boat to which he is assigned go upriver, everyone around him is seen to become more and more insane.  Memorable and increasingly haunting stops along the way include the stopping of a native boat carrying food and a puppy which causes the small American crew to shoot everyone on board before Willard can stop them, and a stop at the last American-held point on the river where the bridge gets built every day and is blown up by VC each night, where Willard is told he is entering hell, where the men have started shooting at trees and when one man is asked who the CO is, he responds, ""Ain't you?"" As Willard and the crew pass the bridge, it collapses behind them, signaling that there can be no going back.  This unbelievably vivid, haunting, imagery shows the Vietnamese conflict in all its deadly glory, where those who have lost their heads have isolated Willard in his conquest, a conquest that has become not only a search for Kurtz, but a search for what, in this war, is really sanity, and for how Willard can find the truth among all the evil and protect this truth within himself.<br/><br/>In all reality, Kurtz is just a figurehead, the personification of haunting truth (and of what good there still can be in all the evil brought out in humankind in the war) that is hidden deep inside a Cambodian jungle. Willard must get around many obstacles to get to the end of the river and to be sure of this truth and take it home with him.<br/><br/>There is no character in this movie that does not contribute to either the black humor or the chilling gothicism that Coppola strives to portray. Sheen plays the central character masterfully and his supporting cast provides a darkening backdrop until the end.  At first glance Brando didn't strike me as good, but then again his character needed to be a representation.  He wasn't supposed to seem like a real person at all, and so he stayed both as eccentric and as simple as he could at the same time, although he could have been a little more low-key.  It was a more difficult role than people imagine, which is probably why he was chosen.<br/><br/>The most poignant of statements in this movie, however, comes not from Kurtz (basically he was just an object), but from the daughter of the Frenchman. Her sentence echoes in the back of our minds, and its meaning grows stronger until the conclusion:<br/><br/>""Don't you see? There are two of you...one that kills, and one that loves...""<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>If anything can be turned into a modern gothic masterpiece, the war in Vietnam is it, and Coppola has done it with the utmost of skill and attention to theme and setting."
"Emerenciano","9","3","3","28 November 2002"," Breath-taking!
","War has been the theme of many of the greatest movies of all times, such as Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"", Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", Stone's ""Platoon"" and Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"". These films  are living examples of Hollywood passion for military conflict, mainly World War II and Vietnam War. It's interesting how we can never ignore this movies, full of battles, shots and explosions. <br/><br/>    I'm sure it's not easy for the directors to rule such big projects where a numerous cast is involved and millions of dollars are spent. We can't deny these characteristics attract us, once we realise we have seen all the cited movies lots of times. <br/><br/>    ""Apocalypse Now"" is something we just cannot miss at all. Coppola's direction is wonderful and the cast counts on Marlon Brandon, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Laurence Fishbourne, Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford. The plot itself is different from anything we have seen in the genre of films: Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Brando) is a dissident officer who lives somewhere in Asia leading his own army and obeying his own laws. This makes Capt. Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen) goes out in a mission to get Kurtz. This itself could be enough to make ""Apocalypse Now"" great, but then we see the wonderful performances Brando, Duvall and Sheen have. Not to be missed.<br/><br/>My rate 9/10"
"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","3","3","26 March 2004"," More than just a film and a Masterpiece
","`Apocalypse Now wasn't about Vietnam, it was Vietnam' they are the famous words of Francis Ford Coppola and I could not agree more with every word he said.   Apocalypse Now for me wasn't just a film, it was an experience which I hold dear to my heart and always will.   It may have taken a long while for this to be made, but imagine what it would have been like if all the problems that occurred didn't happen, it wouldn't be the same film.  It was like it was meant to be a horrendous shoot to make it what it is and that is the great living film ever to be done.   If you take notice into every film Coppola has done since Apocalypse Now you see them as not bad or just good films, but he has accomplished something that is so harrowing and epic as this.  Coppola put so much into the movie based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness it was like he had no more vision left to put into his other projects.  Maybe Apocalypse Now was the film to blame for the not so good Godfather 3.  I enjoyed The Godfather 3 just as much the first two but  you could see something lacking from the third instalment that he didn't bring up like he did with the other two.  <br/><br/>The story revolves around Captain Willard played by Martin Sheen who is an assassin travelling up a river with a small platoon to terminate a colonel who has gone insane.   That is the movie.  You live with these men for the first two hours of the film on this boat and the situations that happen throughout and then it comes to a halt when they arrive at Kurtz's camp where you finally get to see what you have imagined would look like.  I expected to just see a camp full of soldiers but you instead see a platoon of tribesmen and warriors who have no grip on reality and what is the difference between right and wrong.  The journey up the river starts off exciting with many things happening whether it would be the invasion on the beach with the crazy but commanding Kilgore or the playboy bunnies concert at the barracks.  The more it goes on the slower the plot is and the more relaxing it becomes.  The story begins to tire and so do you but not in a bad way.  It happens in a way where you just feel you know that these soldiers have travelled so far and tragedy has struck them one to many times and there is no reality in their minds anymore.<br/><br/>Friends ask me what do I prefer, Redux or the original?  I say both as the original version of Apocalypse Now was just unspeakable of how good a film could be and when I saw Redux it was just a bonus and answered questions that I didn't have the answers to.   It is an emotional roller coaster ride of a movie and does depress you in a way.  You either come out of the film thinking `wow' or `What the hell was that'?   It scares me to think what George Lucas's version would have been like if he took the helm.  It would have been more commercialised  probably in my opinion and also under budget. I think if Orson Welles went ahead with Heart Of Darkness then it would have been great and Coppola could have still made Apocalypse without much comparison to Welles's version as it would not have been set in the same backdrop of the Vietnam war.  But there is a part of me that is thankful for Welles not to direct Heart Of Darkness because it makes Apocalypse Now stand out more to the rest and that's what makes it so groundbreaking.   I remember seeing Redux in the cinema on release and the whole multiplex was packed and when Brando mutters the words `The Horror, The Horror, The Horror' and there are cross dissolves of Willard's painted face and the helicopters from the beginning flying In the background, the lights came on and everyone left in utter silence, and that's what makes Apocalypse Now so good even to this day, it silences everybody and doesn't make you think because there is no message here to read, just an experience of pure madness.   Even though Brando is only seen for at least a quarter of the of the picture, he is the man that steals the film under everybody's except Coppola's feet.  His ad libing of every scene is what an actor is really about.  He is without doubt the last great actor and no one apart from De Niro has been able to touch Brando for what he has achieved in his acting career.  He is not your average type an actor, he's your Jim Morrison of the movies who just doesn't seem all there but speaks words of beauty and terror through his words.   The music of The Doors is as haunting as any original movie score could ever be and comes in at the right time and Carmine Coppola just shines as more as his music did in The Godfather to bring the horror and heart of darkness to an end.   <br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is not one of the greatest films ever made, it is the greatest film ever made and no film will probably ever surpass it, not in my lifetime anyway and if something does come along then it will have to be noting short of a miracle and let's face it you don't see many of them in Hollywood."

","As a Cinema Studies major, I'm forced to constantly rely on video tapes and DVDs to study movies I have to write about in more detail.  There are HUGE conveniences to these media: the ability to move forward and backwards within the film with ease, the low cost, the lack of a need to get myself a large screen and a projectionist, etc.  I've always been a big lover of watching movies on the big screen for the enhanced size of the image, thus making it easier to catch small nuances in shot composition, and because of the ever increasing awe of modern sound systems.  I don't think films like ""Black Hawk Down"" would work without massive, multidirectional audio.  Well, Apocalypse Now Redux proved something further to me...  film projection makes everything just look better.  <br/><br/>When I caught the Redux at an Oberlin Film Series screening, I was absolutely FLOORED by the depth and variety of color and light at work in this film.  I'll admit to not particularly liking some of the added scenes. The dialogue in the plantation sequence was VERY heavy-handed and not in the poetic manner of much of the dialogue in other parts of the film.  But the images... I was drawn into the film on the pure power of seeing film as a medium in its most powerful form.  From the opening explosions to the haunting sound of the Doors, to the scene of Martin Sheen rising from the mud, the film was as textured and palpable as a Van Gogh painting.  I've never once had any kind of illegal substance, let alone hallucinogens in my life, but I felt out of body watching this movie.  I was awestruck at the sheer power of a film's imagery.  Watching this film, I fell in love with movies again.  Thank you, Mr. Coppola.<br/><br/>

"lolique","10","3","3","5 October 2001"," Director's cut or director's nightmare?
","Let me first state that I consider ""Apocalypse Now"" in my top 5 best films of all times and the botched, bloated Redux version will not change my opinion. When I first saw the film it was more than just a motion picture, it was a horrifying exploration into the Vietnam war and just like Coppola has stated that it ""was not a film about the Vietnam war, but the Vietnam war"", the picture gripped me more than any before or any after. It is truly a film masterpiece in every respect. Unfortunately the new Redux version is something else. First of all, it incorporates three sequences (the Playboy bunnies in a stranded helicopter, the French plantation and its strange ghost-like characters and the ridiculous scene of Kurtz reading paragraphs from Time magazine to a tied-up Willard), which should have remained in their natural habitat: the cutting-room floor. The rest of the film is a strange mixture of scenes successfully extended to give more insight into the characters, or the excellent dissolve montage at the beginning with the ceiling fan, the stealing of Colonel Kilgore's surfing board, the expansion of Kurtz's dialogue near the end where he comes in and out of shadows, but gone is the tight and to the point editing that turned this river journey from a terrifying and gripping nightmare into a milk run or travelogue more suited for the Discovery or History Channels. They should have followed Willard's advice after the tiger incident: ""don't ever get off the boat again"". One scene in special comes to mind: the one where they open fire on the innocent Vietnamese on the boat that they meet in the river. In the original version this scene came at a moment that the tension in the film was so high that the gunner's reaction was totally motivated and came about as a release to the nervous tension that had everyone in the boat on the edge of insanity. In the new version the killing becomes just a senseless massacre without any motivation at all. And there are many other instances just like it, but hard to pin down from seeing this version only once. Also, the absence of the original ending is a big disappointment. Anyhow, it is sad to see that even with 22 years of hindsight, Coppola still doesn't have the necessary objectivity to manipulate his material again. A prettier, larger package doesn't necessarily make a better film."

"PLundblad","10","3","3","2 September 2001"," River revisited
","River revisited<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now Redux sets a new standard among the 'Directors Cut'-versions of old classics that has continued to surface during the last decade. True, most of these versions has been better than the originals  most notably the versions of Blade Runner and The Abyss  but they have been more or less the same movie with a few changes. But when 53 minutes  roughly one third of the running time  of unknown events been added to a familiar story, we are set with a new story. Therefore it's more accurate to regard this as a new movie. And there's no doubt about it, this one is even better then the original. To be more precise, it's 53 minutes better The inserts are many, but here's a basic rundown of the major events thats new: First of all, the famous scene on the beach where the mad Colonel wipes out an entire village in order to surf there, has been extended with a clever twist: Willard and his crew steals the colonels surf-board as they sneak off with their boat. The colonel is very upset by this, and pursues them with helicopters. The tape recorder in the chopper doesn't play Wagner any more, though. Instead we hear the colonel on a taped message in which he begs them to return his surfboard to him. That's a scene that has been extended. But there are some scenes that we have never seen before at all. One is a follow-up to the scene where the Playboy Playmates drive the soldiers to a frenzy. They find them again further up in the jungle where they have been stranded, and trade diesel to sexual favours in return from them. These scenes are both observant and strong, and seem very logic as a follow up to the earlier scene. But the best new sequence is when Willard and the crew on the boat arrives to a ragged French rubber-plant in the jungle. A few bits of this has been seen before, in the documentary of the making of Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>This sequence is actually one of the fundaments of the story in the movie. It's quite long, and incorporates several key lines, that are at the core of the story. 'We fight because we fight for our home, for whats been ours for seventy years', says the owner of the plantation. 'You americans, you fight for the worlds biggest nothing', he continues to Willard. There's also a short love affair between Willard and a woman at the plantation. 'Don't you understand theres two of you?' she says to Willard. 'One that loves. And one that hates.' This is one of the key elements to the movie, and adds to our understanding of how and why Willards personality changes as they travel up the river. The ending is much longer. More scenes when Willard confronts Kurtz are added. It doesn't clarify much, though. Sane reasoning and logic has still ceased to exit at the macabre and horrible place at the end of the river. And one of the reasons that I absolutely love this movie is that its narrative and structure follows the dramatic path its characters experience when they travel there.<br/><br/>Per Lundblad"

","I saw this film once per decade in my first thirty years on Earth, and I've decided I don't need or want to see it again. It's a good film, and interesting from start to finish, but for me its I first saw this movie as a kid, and I was impressed (if rather confused). I had no idea it was supposed to be the best film ever, so it never occurred to me that anyone might think that.<br/><br/>Next time I saw the film I was in my teens, and I'd read Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness - thus, I was less impressed. By this point I was a little more into movies, so I'd seen more critically acclaimed classics too - another contributing factor to the film's diminishment in my eyes.<br/><br/>The last time I saw it was in my mid-to-late twenties, and I was honestly disappointed. When I next had the chance to watch the movie, a year or so ago, I passed.<br/><br/>Fans of Coppola and lovers of this movie will be ready by now to condemn me as a moron or philistine, but I truly believe this to be an overrated Hollywood mess.<br/><br/>It fails as an adaptation because of all the extraneous business: it's no longer about a man's journey to find Kurtz, it's about a seething mass of American national obsessions over Vietnam, war, race and imperialism.<br/><br/>Also, unlike Conrad's spare, to-the-point writings, the film deals almost exclusively in hyperbole. There are quiet moments, but they ring false in amidst the craziness.<br/><br/>As other reviews have pointed out, it's not really a war movie. However, its hard to see it as such since every scene is more or less obsessing over Vietnam.<br/><br/>Other reviews have also pointed out that it's not meant to be realistic, but I question that perception. It looks to me as if it *is* intended to be realistic in many ways - and the fact that it isn't is another of the film's failings in my eyes.<br/><br/>The racism of the film is also uncomfortable to me. Where Conrad's novel embodied the racism of its era (in which a white European did indeed have trouble viewing black Africans as human), this comparatively recent film embodies modern American racism by treating its nonwhite extras like so many cattle (no reference intended).<br/><br/>None of them have personalities or recognisable aims and objectives - they're seen only as faceless savages, as dangerous enemies, a mindless force which can be harnesses either by clever Communists or manipulative madmen.<br/><br/>The key performances are more interesting than actually good. Sheen isn't outstanding, certainly not at his best, and Fishburne is way underused. The big disappointment, however, is Marlon Brando. After such a long journey, so many death and traumas, its awful to realise that their objective is this old tubby loon who waddles around mumbling and being worshipped by unconvincing ""savages"".<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of Brando, who for me is like an older, fatter Al Pacino. He knows no restraint, and while many film lovers rate him all his performances seem pretty much the same to me... in that these are actors whose personalities get in the way of their acting. They always seem like themselves, whether its appropriate or not.<br/><br/>It's probably fair to point out that I'm not a Coppola fan, either. The phrase I used as a header here was originally something I said about The Godfather. Coppola's movies always come across bombastic and self-important, self-consciously ""big"" movies with heavy themes.<br/><br/>I do understand the film, and I appreciate that it has many moments of inspired cinematography and several truly amazing scenes. But for me, it never connects emotionally.<br/><br/>Too many characters and situations ring false. The structure is too messy, the use of pop music grates on my nerves, the plot-holes are increasingly apparent with every viewing, and to top it off I find the idea that this is adaptation of Conrad rather absurd. In many ways it's less true to the source than West Side Story is to Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, as such, but a deeply flawed film... and, from a personal point of view, sententious and unnecessary."

He calls the REDUX/redo/re-edit that he put in theaters in 2001 the ""definitive version"" of Apocolypes Now. He's crazy. He hasn't made a decent film in a long, long time. He took a great and classic film and ruined it, and it's his own. Will he do this to the first two Godfather films? Robert Duvall's gung-ho character has turned into a buffoon, searching for a surfboard that Martin Sheen has stolen. Martin Sheen's character has turned into a warm-hearted guy who loves his crew, plays games with them like stealing surfboards, as opposed to a serious guy who has a very serious mission like in the original. Marlon Brando reads TIME magazine. And there is a scene with a French Plantation that destroys the entire flow to the movie, and plays like a corny dream sequence and is just horrible, with acting so bad it's more of a nightmare. The worst scene in the redux is when Chef and Lance (Fred Forrest and Sam Bottoms) party in a ""parked"" helicopter with some of the Playboy Playmates from the previous R&R scene. One of the playmates has a birdcage on her head, no joke. This is another scene that kills the entire flow of the movie, and makes Martin Sheen a nice guy, since he is the one who sets up his men with the girls in the first place. And also, Coppola takes the scene where Lance is water skiing (with the Stones ""Satisfaction"" playing) and moves it from the beginning of the film to the middle. This was, in the original, one of the best setup scenes of all time, letting you unwind and to get to know the laid-back situation of these men, and Coppola ruins it. Oh the horror, the horror, the horror of this redux. The Redux is a total travesty. Coppola has ruined his own masterpiece. Imagine Van Gogh, if he'd lived, taking ""Starry Night"" and adding to it, or DiVinci or Monet or anyone else. Coppola has lost it, completely. And so, the true ""horror"" isn't the Vietnam war, but the hands of a burnt-out has-been filmmaker mangling one of his best works. And by the way, here I am reviewing the redux only, which is why there is only one star."
"psionchronicles","10","5","6","31 August 2019"," My Favorite Movie of All Time
","My stepdad was an MP in Vietnam, and his comment after watching this was, ""This wasn't Vietnam... it was somebody's nightmare."" My mother's take was that it was ""the most satanic movie ever made"". The problem with most movie reviewers and critics is that they evaluate every movie based on the same criteria, which only benefits cinema majors. My stepdad's evaluation was based on how closely it portrayed his experience in Vietnam, and that wasn't really the premise of this movie. Vietnam is only used as a setting here for a re-telling of ""Heart of Darkness"" to make it relatable to modern audiences; anyone with no familiarity with the Conrad novel will completely miss that and dismiss this as a psychotic maligning of the Vietnam War.
This movie was a personal turning point for me. What it excelled at was making me question much of what I'd been taught and shown in my life and my perspectives on things. Willard's line sums it up: ""The more I saw of lies, the more I hated them."" I came to admire how he abandons any notions of being any more or better than what he is. The real grit of this narrative is how you may not agree with his or Kurtz's methods or understandings or morality, but you can clearly understand how they could arrive at them. So based on the criteria of ""movies that made me think"", I give it 10 stars. If I were to rate it based on historical accuracy, I'd have to bump that down to 3; at least it depicts the Vietnam leadership as buffoons, which by all accounts they were. If I were to rate it on memorable scenes and quotable lines, again a 10. Casting and acting I'd give a 10. It did a fantastic job of taking a war movie beyond mere battle scenes and into the larger issues of morality and judgment."
"sfraasch-1","10","5","6","20 April 2006"," Insanity is Not a Theme
","I really don't think the movie has much to do with insanity as it has to do with the fact that war is simply not civil. If it is fought in a non-committal way, it is a waste of time and victory cannot be sought. Those who would fight it brutally might be considered insane, but they are actually rational.<br/><br/>The Darkness or ""Horror"" is not insanity, but a realism by Col Kurtz of what is required to win war: Total commitment by the US to wage total warfare resulting in total annihilation (recall his penciled notes in red ink, ""Drop the bomb. Kill them all"").<br/><br/>When Coppola commented that the movie IS Vietnam, I think this is at least one point he was making: the futility of fighting a dedicated enemy with limited means. Recall Kurtz's comments of what he could accomplish with 10 divisions of troops of the likes that cut off the arms of innoculated children. He was referring to the brutality AND will required to win war. In contrast to his and Willard's will to accomplish their missions, there is ample evidence of those who are trying to escape Vietnam: Lance and LTC Kilgore's surfing obsession during supposed combat, the troops swimming in the river trying to escape the bridge outpost, the lack of officers present and in control, the high ranking general living a pampered existence in his comfortable airstream trailer, and Lance's escaping thru dropping acid.<br/><br/>Those that advocate total war to seek victory (like Kurtz, and implicitly Captain Willard) are probably correct, but made out to be insane. This is not unlike previous history, when Gen MacArthur advocated invading Manchuria and bombing across the Yalu river, essentially fighting Red China and using nuclear weapons. Truman, Marshall, and Bradley agreed that the Korea conflict had to be limited, and MacArthur removed as the UN forces Commander. The same principle was applied in Vietnam, where limited war was micro-managed by Secretary MacNamara and the pentagon. Uncontrolled escalation by the Army could lead to conflict with China and the USSR. Loose cannons such as Col Kurtz were dangerous and could not be tolerated in the officer corps.<br/><br/>I still wonder if the reason to eliminate Kurtz were his views, or his actions ?"
"Jacques98","10","82","160","26 January 2009"," Apocalypsenothing happensNow.
","* Just to get it out of the way: I viewed the Redux version of this film, and that MAY be the cause of some of my negative statements. I cannot say for certain either way.<br/><br/>If you've ever been a member of a message board and you've read the thread about the last movie you watched, you'll know that 99% of the replies have one word or less beside the official score. For a long time, I wondered how that could be. I used to think, ""Don't these people have any more of an opinion other than 'good' or 'bad' or 'average'? They just wasted their lives watching a movie; couldn't they say more than just a score?"" It took me a few months to figure the entire situation out, but when I did, it made perfect sense. Most movieseven good moviesare so predictable and unoriginaleven if they're enjoyablepeople still lack any real, definitive feelings about them. They see a movie on a Friday night and by Saturday night they forgot they even watched it. As a writer myself, I know first-hand there is nothing worse than an indifferent audience, but it seems that sums up most of the American population. Why? Because of films like Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now opens up with a semi-interesting beginning. It misleads the viewer into thinking that it actually has some physiological depth, then completely drops all depth into the gutter by the 10-minute mark and never picks it up again. Despite what you were lead to believe, there is no plot here. Or let me rephrase that: there is a plot, but it drops it after the 20-minute mark and never picks it up again until the final 30 minutes. Everything between those two points is exactly what you expect for a clichéd war drama . . .<br/><br/>Talking. It almost amuses me that an ""epic"" movie can have the flattest characters in cinema history, but the screenwriters always have them talk and talk as if they're actually interesting to listen to. In Apocalypse Now's case, the characters are ALL walking stereotypical war clichés with legs andunfortunately tongues. They're all simply nothing but dumb animals created to carry the pointless dialogue out. They talk so much it's downright nauseating. What are they talking about? I forgot, and I just finished the film 10 minutes ago. Their dialogue is all predictable copy/paste war dialogue; I do remember that much. Naked girls, guns, cliché monologues about life/deathall the stuff you've heard thousands of times. I was never a soldier in the Vietnam War, but I can pretty much assure you the real soldiers talked about more than these unimaginative movies give them credit for.<br/><br/>Besides talking, what do you get in Apocalypse Now? Well, there are only two main action scenes in the entire movie, so you can cross balls-to-the-wall war action off your list of expectations. No, this nearly 4-hour long film focuses on shots of boats going down the river with soldiers talking, and not much else. There is no emotional experience here. There is no ""horror"", as the tagline proclaims. The most ""horror"" you get is a bunch of PG-rated war scenes and some eerie music as the soldiers move through fog. If the director had focused on the true horror of realistic war, I wouldn't have to be sarcastic when I say: How terrifying! Instead, however, the director focuses things we've seen before. Hundreds of times. He focuses on the copy/paste Hollywood-style war, not the truly gritty, dirty war. He doesn't rub your nose in the true horror of war; he pats you on the back and gives you generic conversation scenes.<br/><br/>My point here: Apocalypse Now is one of the most boring movies even filmed. It's also safe and predictable, adding nothing whatsoever to the overdone war genre. It doesn't leave you thinking, ""My God, this is terrible!"" It leaves you thinking, ""My God, I could have done the laundry with that wasted time . . ."" <br/><br/>And that's all. That's all there is to say about this nearly 4-hour long movie. The entire synopsis of every major event from open to close could literally be told in two sentences of text. Sometimes you have to sit back and realize that most award-winning, critically acclaimed, ""classic"" films are nothing but hollow shells. They boast great acting and cinematography, but they have no story. No soul. No moral. No thrill. No point . . .<br/><br/>This is why I blame films like Apocalypse Now for the indifference people have toward movies. These films are supposedly the best of the best, but at the same time they're completely forgettable to anyone who doesn't try their hardest to find pleasure in boredom in hopes of becoming an all-powerful FILM BUFF on some cheesy website. There is nothing wrong with being intellectual. There is something wrong with being pretentious and internally forcing yourself to love a film just because the critics do. And those are the only people who could give Apocalypse Now a perfect score. Or even a mildly positive score.<br/><br/>0/10"
"Manthorpe","10","8","11","17 June 2004"," Madness.
","Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) has been sent on a classified mission into Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is hard for Capt. Willard to understand how Col. Kurtz could go off the deep end as he has, killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands. What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target, he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he decide to do once he finds him?<br/><br/>Any movie that can start out with The Doors' ""The End"" is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song. Apocalypse Now does this perfectly. I can't think of anything better for it to be set to, the Vietnam War and the insanity in the soliders' minds that it created. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Vietnam, the ultimate destination of which is murder. Through it's use of music and score alone, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence, and insanity. A perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here.    <br/><br/>An overall great cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread. I just don't like Fishburne, ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold. I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care. We need to sick Gary Oldman on him. Brando is excellent as Col. Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall's Lt. Colonel Kilgore. Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date. He simply nailed his character, which is one of the best in the entire film, as the gung-ho Air Cavalry commander who loves to surf. Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant. I also love the smell of napalm in the morning.<br/><br/>The plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, plain and simple. But it's the journey of the film that is really it's heart and also the dire situations of war itself. In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey. I don't feel they take away anything though, it's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original. Through this journey, the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it...in fact, that's the entire point. On top of that, the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz' to go completely mad.  <br/><br/>
A big war movie lover, this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all of them classics. I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what I've said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War....so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless...even if after having most recently view AN I think it's a tad better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it's been given. As a fellow reviewer has previously stated, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made."

"bob the moo","Null","9","13","1 July 2002"," Great interpretation of a good book to deliver points on the nature of war
","In an updating of `Hearts of Darkness' a soldier is given a mission to travel up a river During the Vietnam war in order to terminate the command of Colonel Kurtz.  Kurtz is operating without orders and is leading a group of natives in brutal violent strikes against the enemy.  Despite his history of brilliance and decoration he has clearly gone mad.  Willard joins a military boat and travels up river to his destiny.  However the further he travels the more madness appears to have become the norm.<br/><br/>It is a film everyone knows, and a `making of' story that is familiar to everyone on some level.  The problems with the military, with destroyed sets right down to Keitel walking off set to be replaced by Martin Sheen who then had a near complete breakdown during filming.  However the story itself is what keeps this so popular.  The original book is set in Victorian times and is similar only in the concept of travelling up a river and confronting something dark and changed in the shape of Kurtz.  The modern day spin on it makes it even more interesting as it looks at the madness that comes with power within war.<br/><br/>The journey itself is at times comic and at other times brutal.  The overall feeling is one of soldiers not knowing why they are fighting or who they are fighting.  The feeling of confusion and fear is inherent in the film and is very well delivered.  Willard's journey never fails to grip and is interesting on whatever level you watch it  whether it be for the famous set pieces or for the underlying themes.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent.  Sheen has never been better and now seems so distant from his character that he is a different person.  While some of the emotion on screen was real, he does a great job as our guide through the journey.  The best performance comes from a surprising source Brando. Despite the fact that he was difficult, horribly over weight and hadn't learnt his lines, his eerie performance is still haunting.  His mumbling and reasoning in the shadows show that he may be touched by madness but, in the context of war, he is also touched by cold logical reasoning.  Likewise Dennis Hopper fits in well despite his stoned demeanour.  The support cast include some names as Albert Hall, Harrison Ford, Forrest and a young Larry Fishburne.<br/><br/>Overall this will remain a classic on many levels.  The film itself is great and full of spectacle, the story of the making itself is interesting, the performances are wonderful despite everything and the fact that it has other themes makes it even better.  As an war movie it is great simply because it isn't about the war it IS war  in the words of Coppola `it isn't about Vietnam, it is Vietnam, it's how the Americans were in Vietnam.  We were in the jungle, we had too much money, too much equipment and, little by little, we went insane'.  Classic film on so many levels."

","It's a pity to see a director put so much time and effort into a film and come back with something so awful.  This film is pretentious, chaotic, self-indulgent and ridiculously overrated.  The first half has its moments, even though Robert Duvall's character is a cartoon, but once Dennis Hopper and Marlon Brando show up and start chewing the scenery as if it's all you can eat at the diner and they've been on a three-day fast, the movie dies. The last twenty minutes or so look as if they were filmed by a three-year-old playing with his father's movie camera.

Even then it doesn't live up to the expectations of what the characters in the film have been trying to imply all along.<br/><br/>There was nothing insane about this film or the guy on the island, there was maybe a few minutes of very mild gore, nothing scary, no horror and no craziness.. just dull dull dull.<br/><br/>I would find the beeping noise of a reversing truck more exciting than this film."
"mmora7259","10","6","8","8 January 2007"," If you think Redux's scenes are unnecessary, you know little of film
","This film is special on many levels and for multiple reasons in both the original and the redux cuts but what makes this a GREAT film is that in essence it is not a war film but a film about war and what it does to people. This theme is portrayed well in the original cut but in redux makes this even clearer. Through the added length, and what some have viewed obnoxious length is purely purposeful to add to this element. As the film is watched you yourself begin to break down just as captain Willard in the movie. The film with the Frenchmen and the woman also add a sense of surreality that the original didn't. The scene with the playboy bunnies also serves this purpose. The extra scene with Kilgore and the laughing and extra surfing add to this also. As a director Coppola was disappointed with the original cut because he didn't believe that it totally brought across the surreal and trippy element he wanted the film to be about. These scenes do nothing but add a human element to the film, as emotion passes from the screen into the viewer. Some people watch movies for pleasure but the redux version is an experience and if you can't handle the awkwardness and discomfort of these added scenes and the experience therein then we know which kind of movie viewer you are."

Kurtz is not mad because of the war...he is mad because of what he must do to win against barbarians...he had to sacrifice his humanity and he did it willingly. He teaches us that in order for civilzied human beings to survive an onslaught of barbarians, you have to immerse yourself...defeat your own humanity. And then, when you have defeated the barbarian, you look around...and you are not human any more. In essence, the barbarian wins by forcing this sacrifice on civilized warriors. I left the theater in amazement that such a topic was even thought of for cinematic art. I got it just about everyone else missed it. And I felt contempt for those around me in the leaving crowd who were complaining they were disappointed in the film. They completely missed the point. Now, civilized people are faced again with a decision against barbarians who saw peoples heads off on TV. Will we immerse ourselves and our humanity to do what we must to survive...or will we surrender to the alternative if we don't? Is a surrender to barbarians as bad as becoming one of them?

"classicalsteve","10","7","10","19 January 2009"," Incredible Adaption of Conrad's ""The Heart of Darkness"" -- Possibly Coppola's Masterpiece
","Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs, and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Green Berets"" which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The ""Apocalypse Now!"" project, the production and resulting film, is ""Heart of Darkness"" updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve. This is the plight of Joseph Conrad's original character Kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in TS Eliot's ""The Hollow Men"" (Mistah Kurtz, he dead) of 1925. Although neither a straight telling of Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" (1901) nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience, ""Apocalypse Now!"" stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential. ""Apocalypse"" is not just about the ""horrors"" of war per se, like ""Platoon"" and ""The Deer Hunter"", but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale. Apocalypse Now! is not so much seen as experienced.<br/><br/>The bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a tour-de-force performance), aboard a US military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia where few westerners would ever tread. His mission is to terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a career army Special Forces Division officer who was the darling of the US Military until he went AWOL and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out, something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity. Sheen's mission is to terminate the colonel with the American public none the wiser.<br/><br/>The movie is rather episodic. The journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as Sheen and his crew meet different self-contained ""aspects"" of the war at the ground level. American audiences of the 1970's had probably never seen this kind of film-making before, with the possible exception of ""The Deer Hunter"" which was released in the previous year. The first, and one of the most notable, is an helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. He loves to play ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from Wagner's ""The Ring"" when he bombards helpless villages. His line ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning"" is one of those oft-quoted lines from the annals of cinema. Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies.<br/><br/>Despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can, the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing. The original release (not the later Redux version) does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some of the shots of both Sheen and Brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film. Not even the likes of Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in terms of horrific imagery. Brando's Kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison, which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from within.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, Coppola's solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations. According to the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness"", Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama, and the atmosphere of the movie's darker hues would be compromised. He wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom Coppola was using as extras in the scenes with Kurtz at ""his"" village. After the viewing, Coppola had his ending, and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American film-making. Love it or hate it, no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene.<br/><br/>This film is not for all tastes just as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. It's not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most American viewers to absorb. It's the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban American life that make this film difficult for the average movie-goer to handle, which is as it should be. Coppola did not make a family picture. However, if the viewer can understand its larger point, there is a lot to be gotten out of Apocalypse Now!. If you're looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensibility and heroism, better stick with John Wayne. But if you're willing to be taken into places you've never been, even beyond ""the evils of war"" rhetoric, ""Apocalypse Now"" will take you into a world you thought you'd never visited before, and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it."
"tedg","Null","16","28","16 January 2002"," The War for your Soul
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the personal risks taken by this filmmaker and crew, and the mapping to the metaphor of war:<br/><br/>Coppola, already rich and famous for the lush but pointless `Godfather' films, reaches into his soul and decides to risk it to do something important. He deliberately chooses Conrad's metaphor of personal journey, and creates a multi-layered structure: the sense of Man in society; the `reason' of War, colonial wars and the specifics of Vietnam; the meeting of darkness of self at the end of the hero's journey; and at the lowest layer, Coppola's own quest for import as an artist.<br/><br/>When I saw this over a couple decades back, I thought it a failure: earnestness does not equal art; commitment does not deliver skill; Italian passion outraces German nihilism.<br/><br/>But now, with the `restored' footage, I have a completely different take. I still think it a failure overall, but with some powerful images. As with the Doors, its aspirations were too large for the ability, the vision too grand for the reach. But now with the passage of time, the metaphor has had a polar switch.<br/><br/>Twenty years ago, the War was a simple affair: confusing at the bristles, jaded selfishness at the handle. With the passage of time as we learn more, the War has `become' incredibly more complex and unfathomable. Now with the film: it started life as huge, unfocused mess. Over a long period, with radical paring and the addition of a very competent framework of sound, something resulted. Unfocused still, but powerful enough to engage. Over time and repeated viewings, this work has been overgrown by personal probings, and integrated into the imaginative landscape like an incompetent building becoming a fond element of the cityscape. So as the war becomes less pegged in our minds, this film becomes more comprehensible, more whole.<br/><br/>With repeated personal handling, this film has become `true.' Think of this: it now has such a clear center that the filmmaker can `enhance' that message. It is now so coherent, it begs for addition. And the three main additions are so, so very apt and self-referential:<br/><br/>-- The French plantation takes its reason to be from the mere fact that it has been. That is precisely what this film has become: a colonizer of our minds that now makes its own sense to be there.<br/><br/>-- The playmates. Sex -- even exploitative sex -- domesticates.<br/><br/>
-- The extra exposure of Brando. Here was a tiger, a man whose presence tore through our minds, who changed the world, who mesmerized. He went down his own personal river before this film and was defeated. Here he shows up in a character who is precisely the actor (with a wildeyed acolyte Hopper similarly spanning fiction and reality). Wasn't clear when the film was new, but is now. These are not the winners we see, but the losers. The horror.<br/><br/>To prepare for this redux, I watched the three `Wallace and Gromit' films. Here also was a personal vision, explored at first with extreme commitment, at high cost in the face of detractors. Working by himself for 7 years produced the first film. It was shockingly weird. The second (and probably the best) was a low-budget collaboration with one other monk. As with `Apocalypse,' this film invented itself, by charm insinuated itself into the familiar as if God had put it there all along. Then by the third film, with scores of people, the magic is transformed to cultural momentum.<br/><br/>But there is hope: `Apocalypse' hangs on the War, and though that metaphoric connection is severed, it still stays on the shelf we first placed it: as a war movie. And there are other war movies. And since films are seldom about reality and instead about other films, we can rely on others to give us distance from this foreign invader. Two very much more skilled filmmakers in particular: Kubrick and Malick. Rely on them."

","This movie was just plain bad. I have never reviewed a movie here in my four years of browsing the site, but never in my days of watching movies have I been so infuriated by a film. For starters, the movie just doesn't make any sense. There is no logical transition from scene to scene. As I was watching this movie, I found myself actually TRYING to convince myself that it was good, that at some point during this overdone, self-righteous piece of poo, that some semblance of a theme or motif would come into play. No: The movie continues to lead you down the linear path of the story. I now see where Charlie Sheen inheritted his blank stare acting prowess from that he so consistently displays on a weekly basis in his new sitcom. Well, I guess it is the apocalypse NOW because I've read that Two and a Half Men is the top viewed sitcom on network television. And guess what, this is the 36th ranked FREAKING movie on IMDb. I never thought that a single movie could cause me to never want to watch another movie of the same GENRE. THATS how bad this movie was. 3 hours and 20 minutes of my life, wasted So I thought that, although I normally don't review movies here, why not put in another 2 minutes so maybe, just MAYBE, I could have done some good by watching this movie. That good will be if I can manage to convince even one potential viewer to avoid this overdone pretentious Francis Ford Coppola bullshit. So as far as I'm concerned, IMDb and every movie critic out there has lost all credibility."

"Don-102","10","17","31","1 December 1999"," Possibly the most ambitious film ever made...
","Francis Coppola's descent into madness back in the late 1970's was all about APOCALYPSE NOW, one of the most incredible pieces of art ever placed on the screen.  It is violent, beautiful, ugly, and damn dark at times.  As a war film, APOCALYPSE NOW does not move me anywhere near the way PLATOON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did.  Those two pictures deal with war in a more combative, realistic way.  You grow and bond with the troupes in those flicks.  Here, you are engulfed in complete madness, something that seems apart from actual war.  It is more of a morality play into the soul and our ""hearts of darkness"" than a war film.<br/><br/>Do I think Coppola made a mistake trying to base a story about the Vietnam War on Joseph Conrad's fictional ""Heart of Darkness""?  Sure, and I think he feels that way too.  Vietnam and the U.S involvement in the war has nothing to do with what Coppola was trying to do.  He once said ""My film IS Vietnam,"" referring to APOCALYPSE, but is it really? Not at all.  What results is unbelievably hard to assess except to say it is sheer brilliance. It transcends the horrors of war and seemed more of a personal film with Martin Sheen representing each of us as a complex human being on an impossible mission.  It is like traveling to Hell and back, many scars obtained, many feelings drowned out.<br/><br/>Everyone who knows a dime about movies, knows the battle itself it was to make this ambitious film.  So many images burn into memory: nepalm explosions to the tune of the Door's ""The End""; Wagner blaring from speakers placed on some U.S. helicopters about to blow up a Vietnamese village; a soldier surfing to the Stone's ""Satisfaction""; the final ritualistic slaughter we witness during the film's dreary ending.  This is all fantasy. The war is nowhere to be found in these and multiple other sequences. Vietnam is merely a backdrop to display a truly insane trip up a river where one clearly defined character (Sheen as Willard) meets a fuzzy character (Brando as Kurtz) and no real resolutions are found.  It is the trip that does it for us.<br/><br/>Wondrously eerie sights, sounds, and experiences pulsate throughout APOCALYPSE NOW and the first three quarters of the film are perfect.  Under the conditions Coppola and crew were working under, it is no wonder they had no ending.  Brando truly ruins what Sheen, in what is probably the most underrated performance of the 70's as ""Willard"", had done to the point of arrival at Kurtz' compound.  What the hell is Brando talking about?  At least Sheen comes through at the end giving us a hint as to what the journey meant to him.<br/><br/>This film ranks way high on my list because of the mystery of it all and the absolute audacity with which Coppola paints his descent into madness."
"andrewtowne-1","1","69","152","26 June 2008"," Pretentious twaddle
","During the Vietnam era, you were either a ""square"" or ""hip"" -- with ""hip"" meaning pro-communist, anti-capitalist, pro-sexual-revolution, anti-mainstream American values. Hollywood directors generally chose to be ""hip."" The significance of this fact should become apparent in due course. <br/><br/>Now, a little boring history for those who can stomach it: U.S. troops were present in large numbers in South Vietnam from roughly 1962 to 1972. U.S. troops came home in '72, having successfully strengthened the South Vietnamese army (ARVN) so that it could defend South Vietnam from invasion by the North Vietnamese communists and from subversion by the South Vietnamese communist Viet Cong. <br/><br/>The ARVN did, in fact, successfully defend South Vietnam for almost three years. Then, a Democrat-controlled Congress cut off funding to the South Vietnamese in the wake of Republican President Nixon's resignation over the Watergate scandal. The North Vietnamese invaded, and South Vietnam fell. <br/><br/>Soon thereafter, the Communist Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia and tortured and murdered some two million innocent men, women and children. This is the true tragedy of the Vietnam war -- something that no Hollywood director to my knowledge has touched (""The Killing Fields"" is not accompanied by a political explanation of the Cambodian Holocaust.)<br/><br/>Four years after the fall of South Vietnam, and seven years after U.S. troops left the country, Francis Ford Coppola made ""Apocalypse Now."" He was one of a slew of Hollywood directors who sought to capitalize on the deep well of anti-war sentiment in the United States. Well, let's examine such anti-war sentiment for a minute. Being anti-war is fine, but those who are against war are called upon to offer alternatives that work -- and they never do. Instead, they hold up the UN as some sort of ideal -- a UN made up mostly of undemocratic countries with no respect for human rights.<br/><br/>In the end, the Vietnam War was but one of a series of proxy wars between the communist Soviet Union (at times allied with communist China) and the capitalist West. The Korean War was the first major battle in this rivalry, where both sides sought to extend their influence while bleeding and demoralizing the other side. These proxy wars were a substitute for all-out nuclear war. Terrible things were done by both sides in this conflict, but I believe that the U.S. cause was a noble one. And it largely succeeded, in that the Soviet Union collapsed and freedom and prosperity expanded into Eastern Europe. <br/><br/>But the conduct of the Vietnam War by U.S. politicians was terrible at best. U.S. soldiers never lost a battle in Vietnam. But politicians in Washington would not allow them to keep the territory they had won. They refused to follow Barry Goldwater's advice, which was to ""Win, or get the hell out!"" They failed to mine Haiphong Harbor in North Vietnam to keep Soviet and communist Chinese supplies out of that country. They refused to invade Laos and Cambodia in order to close down the weapons supply line that ran along the Ho Chi Minh trail, ending only thirty miles from Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Vietnam was the first televised war, and the U.S. media were largely left-wing (as they are today) and anti-war. During the Tet Offensive (a major defeat for the communists, and a major victory for the Americans), Walter Cronkite declared that America had ""failed"" in Vietnam. This was just one of many distortions by the media. The American public stopped supporting the war. And some celebrities -- like Jane Fonda -- actually rooted for victory by the communists. <br/><br/>What, then, do we see in ""Apocalypse Now""? Nothing more than all the one-sidedly anti-American, anti-Vietnam-war stereotypes of the day: playing Wagner (subtle; I don't suppose that could be a suggestion that the Americans were the equivalent of Nazis?); showing a giggling soldier-moron in a helicopter randomly machine gunning innocent Vietnamese peasants (subtle; I don't suppose that could be a suggestion that the Americans were the equivalent of Nazis?); and so on and so forth. <br/><br/>Of course, Coppola wasn't satisfied addressing such ""substantive"" issues. His movie had to be a ""grand vision"" -- not unlike his ""The Godfather."" So he threw everything except the kitchen sink into this movie: the pretentious linkage he tried to make between his magnum opus and Conrad's ""The Heart of Darkness"" -- ""Wow, man! That's heavy! Copolla is our Conrad!""; the psychedelic/surreal affectations (a first!); the ""ironic"" and ""clever"" juxtapositions (a battle mixed up with surfing); the ""revelation"" of ""Ugly American"" insensitivity; and so on. <br/><br/>Well, Copolla was preaching to the choir with this movie, and in this he was a great success. But there is no significance to this movie otherwise. If you really want to see enlightening scenes from Vietnam, rent the multi-disc documentary on the war (I forget the title; there are several.) One very moving scene shows U.S. soldiers singing ""Silent Night"" on the flare-lit battle-field on Christmas eve. Watching a documentary on the war might actually teach you something about that war -- a first! Otherwise, you're going to have to settle for Hollywood's version from the likes of Oliver Stone and Coppola. <br/><br/>The true subject of Coppola's movie, in my opinion, is Coppola's giant ego. The main secondary subject is the dumbing down of an American public that would uncritically eat up his ""vision""; the exact same thing is true of Oliver Stone's various movies. Hollywood thinks that ""Epatez les bourgeois!"" is the last word in creativity, even when its arrows fall far short of the target. <br/><br/>That is the reason why most ""serious"" Hollywood movies, in my opinion, are overblown failures. And Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" surely stands at the very front of the line of those failures."

"jamesreed-52946","9","4","5","31 July 2019"," Don't let people tell you this isn't about the Vietnam War - it's that and much more
","To the people who gave 1/10, let me try and explain why this movie is widely described with superlatives such as seminal and masterpiece.<br/><br/>Like the Stone's Exile on Main St, this film is layered. I've been listening to Exile for 30 years and its layering allows me to listen to different perspectives which stop the record from getting boring. Apocalypse has a similar quality. I first watched it maybe when I was about 18 (late 80s). At the time I didn't get it. I thought it was okay, albeit a bit overrated and perhaps past it's time. In my late 20s I found myself trawling a video library for something to watch. I'd pretty much seen everything so gave Apocalypse another go. The difference that time around was I thought about the movie for days after I had watched it. I watched the movie for the 4th time two days ago (40th anniversary edition). It just gets better every time you watch it. That is rare in a movie. Two days later, I'm not only thinking about it but writing about it.<br/><br/>To those who say this movie is not about the Vietnam War, I disagree. There are two main themes, along with other tributary themes, in this movie. The first is about the horrors of war (everything from death, dehumanisation, killing of innocents, madness etc) which I needn't go into as it's well documented here. The other main theme is the shambles that was the Vietnam War. Incompetence, disunity and malfunction.<br/><br/>The Nung River journey serves it's purpose two-fold - a journey through dehumanisation that ends in madness, and an excuse to show off various examples of malfunction. Every encounter shows and example of why the US lost the war. Kilgore was acting out of self-interest. There was rorting going on left, right and centre. The bridge at the border had no command. In the words of other war movies, the Vietnam War was a cluster****. Perhaps the biggest example of this was in the letters from Kurtz. He found a way to fight the war successfully and was punished for it by his incompetent superiors. This in itself is it's own minor theme. Kurtz went mad not so much because of the physical horrors of war but because he shafted for being competent.<br/><br/>To the people who give the Redux (and therefore the 40th Anniversary edition I saw a few nights back) a 1/10. You have strong points. For me, the plantation scene stopped the flow. I can't see a reason to include this scene other than for Coppola to voice his own opinions of Vietnam through the French character. This further suggests that the disaster of the Vietnam War is indeed one of the main themes. There were other bits that others have pointed out as being unnecessary - the theft of the surfboard and subsequent pursuit of it by Kilgore. Added nothing and took away from the movie.<br/><br/>As for criticisms of Sheen's acting. I thought the whole blank face fit the character. I have no idea how good an actor he is or isn't but for me Willard had thoughts about what was going on but kept them to himself. Initially I think his facial expressions showed he was shocked at the gross incompetence going on around him but chose to keep it to himself.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie four times. The original twice, redux once and 40th anniversary once. I'm going to watch the original again. For anyone who hasn't seen it, my best guess is the original is the best one."
"jmholmes-73727","10","4","5","11 July 2019"," WHOLE NEW WAY TO VIEW THIS STUNNING MASTERPIECE
","When this movie was released in 1979, the term ""post traumatic stress disorder"" was rarely used, certainly not nearly as often as it is today, to describe the emotional anxieties endured by battle-weary soldiers who had returned from the jungles of Vietnam. It seems today that APOCALYPSE,NOW!, large chunks of it anyway, illustrate the effects of this disorder on the characters,situations and most especially the atmosphere and tone of the work. Perhaps this is the reason it resonated so strongly with some viewers at the time, despite its unsatisfying concluding moments that failed to deliver the big action moment many hoped would end the film. Instead, Coppola leaves us in a heart of darkness, stuck as it were, in a state of mind from which escape seems impossible. Not only does the movie not give us an exhilarating battle scene to match the helicopter attack seen earlier, it doesn't even give its characters a rescue or deliverance, and certainly not a homecoming. Where another fil-maker might have inserted a psychologist to comment on the awful anxieties the men might be going through, Coppola shows in nearly every scene
the insanity of their surroundings and the twisted world of war in which they live. He succeeds in using his film to immerse the audience as much as possible in the hell this war created in the minds of the veterans forced to endure it.
There have been four great films about that war: The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Coming Home, and this one - but it is this one, Coppola's, that seems most personal."

","""Apocolypse Now, Redux"" - if you are looking for an ACCOUNT of the Viet Nam war, look elsewhere. If you want a metaphorical look at the war, go right ahead, as in NOTHING is clear, there is no unity. There is no clarity. Everyone is dancing their own dance of death. You have Air Cav commander Kilgore (appropriate name) who commands a fleet of attack helicopters with deadly efficiency as they blare away with Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" as a self-supplied soundtrack. They take out a coastal village that is also a VC outpost (It's pretty obvious, those sandbags aren't there for flood control, folks.) with the latest technology of the time, sending innocent and otherwise fleeing in a shower of burning napalm.<br/><br/>Why? In Kilgore's oblivion to the possibility that he too might be killed, that perhaps to him that none of what's going on around him is real and that it's all a grand illusion, the surfing's great. Clean out Charlie, hang ten, dude even as he lampoons every John Wayne cavalry western ever made, even down to the bugle calls and yellow scarves.<br/><br/>Kilgore's the warm-up act for Kurtz, the spider in the center of the web. His antics are funny, but not THAT funny.<br/><br/>Passing discarded symbols of American materialism (broken bicycles, refrigerators, shattered televisions in the mud, bridges being rebuilt and destroyed within the same 24 hours over and over and over to the point of pointlessness) you travel further upriver with Willard, the operative sent to kill the only other individual in the entire movie with a clear purpose, encounters further absurdities and denials of reality: a USO show where Playboy bunnies bump and grind untouchable on a stage before a barely controlled mob of hopped up sex-starved combat fatigued men who are expected to be civilized about it in the traditional audience/performer relationship only to have the whole thing turn into a total Dionysian riot, not orgy, because the nymphs/metaphorical sacrificial virgins/brides supplied are not only three too few, have been whisked away by a heavenly chariot (as in ""helicopter"") leaving the frustrated men to riot among themselves as the locals whom they've been sent to ""defend"" stoically sit eating rice on the other side of the chain link fence as gigantic ""bullets"" with unit and division insignia painted on their sides loom silently over the whole mess.<br/><br/>Symbols of toxic masculinity abound in this movie: the aforementioned bullets, fighter planes, helicopters, cigarettes, surf boards, water skis, bottles, even the boat that Willard finds himself on as he travels towards his destination/destiny.<br/><br/>Impotence is quieter presence as well, reminding the viewer that there is a price for everything: wrecked bombers and helicopters burning in the tops of trees for starters...) Southeast Asia as depicted IS a woman, to be groped, exploited, and violated at will by whomever happens to be in the neighborhood - no wonder she's furious and a blunt warning to all who would involve themselves in someone else's civil war!) All this as Willard travels up the river, inexorably, blindly as sperm to egg.<br/><br/>Only the egg awaiting him might as well be Satan at the very bottom of the lowest pit of Hell, trapped in a self-built tomb, a frozen morass of his own tears and sins - Lucifer, the paragon of angels who rebelled, a man who groomed for greatness who in some cases was RIGHT, who took things too far in his clarity and now lurks in the shadows of a ruined temple decorated with the remains of his victims - a revealing of the truth, the entire war in microcosm so that when Willard finally comes face to face with Kurtz in an abandoned temple that's really a thinly disguised TOMB, it's like looking into a mirror, monster to monster, face to face, father to son, passing on of a legacy.<br/><br/>As to understanding the power and truth behind pagan myth (Chef, one of the last surviving crewmen does instinctively, and is understandably alarmed when they finally enter the Kurtz domain with it's shrines, crucifixions and ranks of skulls), Kurtz DOES - there's a blatantly displayed copy of ""The Golden Bough"" in his sacred space. No wonder the finale happens during the ritual sacrifice of a water buffalo by hacking it to pieces - a murdered god, as in the legend of Dionysus who is cut to pieces by his own followers, of the Crucifixion: a god/son of God is executed, rises, walks out of a tomb, and resumes his place - which may also explain the rather hard to ignore three crosses (masts) of anchored Cambodian boats against the sky as Willard and the last surviving crew member numbly leave the site of the execution after walking unharmed through a crowd of Kurtz's primitive followers.<br/><br/>Viewed in this light, the journey down the river could also be viewed as a metaphor for the Stations of the Cross, with Willard and how he is treated by Kurtz when he gets there as part of the ordeals of Christ... interesting thought.<br/><br/>ANYWAY...<br/><br/>They are allowed to leave untouched: the Cambodians recognize that their god has risen anew, stopping him would be pointless. Kurtz is dead, long live Kurtz."
"Jonathon_Natsis","9","4","5","21 August 2011"," The horror of war, its beauty on film.
","Between 1979 and 1987, three of the most poignant, relevant filmmakers of the time all left their stamp on different aspects of the Vietnam War. Oliver Stone addressed the duality of men in Platoon, Stanley Kubrick showcased breeding insanity versus the will to stay alive in Full Metal Jacket, and Francis Ford Coppola presented a mind-bending insight into war as an illusionary trip. And while my personal favourite among these films changes regularly, one thing I am sure of is that they are all masterpieces, and Apocalypse Now, for this week at least, may be the best of the lot.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen is Captain Ben Willard, tasked with the covert mission of venturing deep into the jungles of Cambodia to locate and assassinate Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz, a once-promising soldier, has since abandoned the needs of his country and gone completely insane, setting himself up as a god among a native tribe and ruling with dictatorial brutality. <br/><br/>The movie is more road trip than firefight, but I don't mean to sound condescending at all. Most of the film consists of Willard and his small group of soldiers making the trek to Kurtz's stronghold, encountering bizarre characters and scenarios along the way. The most prominent of these is Lieutenant Kilgore (Robert Duvall, rounding up the Godfather reunion), a surfie soldier who'd be terrifying if he weren't so welcoming. <br/><br/>It is from this point onwards that Apocalypse Now transcends the standard parameters of a war film and becomes a hallucinogenic cinematic experience. Many scenes convey such unique, unheard-of aspects of war that they leave you wondering whether what you just saw was real, or an alternate perception of reality seen through the eyes of the drug-taking soldiers. Visual bewilderment is on high supply during the set action pieces as well, with their abrupt ending having the effect of taking repeated blows to the head, then having to get back up as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>But the otherworldly nature of the film is best reflected in the cinematography and sound. Deep shades of orange, gold and purple engulf almost every moment, and the sparing yet effective use of superimposed imagery compounds the eeriness. As for audio, it is easy to point to the excellent use of Ride of the Valkyries during Kilgore's air raid, but that is just scratching the surface. A haunting half-electronic, half-orchestral score dominates the rest of the film, while extracts of The End (by The Doors, a band that has always had a strange resonance with the Vietnam War) complete a flawless technical display.<br/><br/>As Willard and Kurtz meet for the first time, Apocalypse Now goes into thematic overdrive. Most obvious is the old notion that absolute power corrupts absolutely. As the film progresses, we learn that Kurtz's desire to return home diminishes in contrast with his growing godly stature. But the film goes on to raise all sorts of questions regarding vanity and pride in the self, as well as the moral implications of death, and if it can accepted in certain circumstances.<br/><br/>Finally, I feel obliged to mention an event towards the end of the movie, without giving away any major plot points. The climax is intercut with the infamous real-life slaughter of a water buffalo, which occurs in a most inhumane manner. Whether Coppola was justified in his actions (by simply filming an event that was going to be carried out by the natives anyway) depends on which sources you choose to believe. From a purely cinematic perspective, though, it compliments the climax in spectacular fashion. But just as concerning is the aftermath. As the characters that continue to live ponder their actions, the ending is ambiguous in the way that we, as the audience, can only imagine how the evils they have seen will torture them long after the film's events have ended. All the while the war rages on.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

It stars Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms and Albert Hall. Cinematography is by Vittorio Storaro and the music is primarily arranged by Carmine Coppola.<br/><br/>The Vietnam War and Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen) is approached by American intelligence to go on a secret assignment: he's to follow the Nung River into the remote Cambodian jungle to find and assassinate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a member of the US Army Special Forces who has gone insane.<br/><br/>One of the most talked and written about films of all time, Apocalypse Now remains to this day a harrowing and haunting experience to first time viewers. With a production shoot that has in itself become legendary, Coppola's flawed masterpiece has been dissected and argued over to within an inch of its magnificent life. People will continue to write about it for ever more it seems, perhaps there might even be the odd new confrontational spin on what resides within? But ultimately it's what the individual takes away from the film that matters, our own interpretations key to the enjoyment of such a disturbing vision of war and violence.<br/><br/>Many of the set-pieces, dialogue and characters have long since passed into folklore, and rightly so. The Ride of the Valkyries helicopter assault, Kurtz's surreal death camp, the boat people massacre, purple haze, the playmates, Kilgore, and of course the horror, the horror..indeed. The performances match the quality of Storaro's sumptuous Philippines photography, Sheen is fiercely committed and Duvall and Hopper in turn are powerhouse and edgy. While Brando, doing his own bizzaro thing in the last third, brings a little chaos unintentionally in keeping with the madness at the heart of this particular darkness.<br/><br/>Personally that last draggy third does stop it from being a complete genius type whole, but everything up to it is so damn good it's arguably churlish to expect perfection? But as near perfection movies go, Apocalypse Now proudly sits with the best of them, sitting there with a harrowed look upon its face. 9/10"

","Apocalypse Now is a very unusual portrayal of the Vietnam War. It's not the most realistic interpretation of the conflict, and it is very surreal.<br/><br/>One problem that I frequently find with war films is that often, especially when showing intense battles, the plot can be difficult to follow. Another major issue is that, especially when there is a large cast, it can be hard to distinguish the main cast.<br/><br/>Neither of these problems are present in Apocalypse now. Despite it's surreal nature, the film's plot is actually reasonably straight forward and summed up in the trailer: Willard is ordered to find Colonel Kurtz and terminate his command, then takes a patrol boat with four other men up the Nung River o Kurtz's compound.<br/><br/>The majority of the main plot is confined to the patrol boat, dealing with various problems that the main cast encounters over the course of the journey.<br/><br/>The cast is actually pretty easy to tell apart. There are five main characters aboard the boat, and all of them have distinctive features which allow them to be recognized instantly.<br/><br/>The acting is also brilliant. Martin Sheen is great as Captain Willard, a soldier whose mind has been completely messed up by his experiences in the war. The rest of the main cast (including a really young Lawrence Fishbourne) does great as well, making them very easy to relate to.<br/><br/>Most of the other actors have very brief roles, and you won't see much of them, but they are still very memorable. The most famous is Robert Duvall's appearance as Lt. Colonel Bill Kilgore, an air cavalry officer who takes a bit too much pleasure out of the war, playing 'Ride of the Valkyries' while attacking a village and then having his men surf in the middle of the battle. <br/><br/>Also notable is Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz, the insane officer whom Willard is sent to kill. His first scene is probably his best, in which both Kurtz and Willard are only partially visible in the dim light.<br/><br/>Other supporting actors include Harrison Ford's brief appearance as Colonel Lucas, the officer who assigns Willard his mission; and Dennis Hopper as an annoying photojournalist who admires Kurtz. Both manage to put on great performances.<br/><br/>Overall, Apocalypse Now is a very unusual and brilliant portrayal of the Vietnam War. It is very effective in illustrating the insanity that took place, and if you interested in war films, you will definitely have to check it out."
"khanbaliq2","10","4","5","7 June 2010"," Apocalypse Now resembles no other film ever made.
","In 2009, the London Film Critics' Circle voted Apocalypse Now the best film of the last 30 years. During the Vietnam War, a US captain (Martin Sheen) is sent up the Mekong river with a small crew to terminate 'with extreme prejudice' the command of a colonel (Marlon Brando) who, suffering delusions of grandeur, is ruling his own 'kingdom' in the jungle.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is a fever dream of a war film, a hallucinogenic experience that aims to replicate the dislocation and hellishness of the Vietnam conflict. It's easily disparaged as an expensive folly that got out of control, both in the logistical and budgetary sense. But it remains a series of dazzling, sometimes macabre set-pieces, held together by a river journey into the unknown. Based loosely on Joseph Conrad's novel Heart Of Darkness, it shares that book's sense of horror and insanity. Even the film's harshest critics would concede that it is unforgettable."
"bobsgrock","10","4","5","22 November 2009"," Far out of reach for any filmmaker today.
","There are quite a few good movies out in circulation today, many of which have been released in the past five years. None, however, can claim the title of most ambitious film of all time. For that title must go to Apocalypse Now, the classic yet surreal tale of US forces in Vietnam experiencing more than their share of problems and violence amongst the jungles and wilderness.<br/><br/>What does one say about a film like this? It certainly isn't easy to criticize, mostly because you don't really watch it so much as experience it. Every scene builds tension and emotion as you watch these young American boys, innocent when arriving, be turned into robotic killers with an almost complete lack of remorse or emotion. Coppola is able to keep our attention and at the same time somehow get us to sympathize but also be stunned at the severity of the action taking place. Each scene is so layered, so complex with what it is trying to evoke that it makes the viewing experience a mind-blowing journey very much like Willard's journey to Kurtz.<br/><br/>The success of this film is in no small thanks to the acting, with the classic lineup delivering on the nose the exact tone of monotonous and deplored sense of bewilderment. Of course, it is Marlon Brando who is the show-stopper as Kurtz, the crazed colonel running his own version of the war in the heart of the jungle. As we follow Willard (Martin Sheen) to find Kurtz, we realize perhaps he is not as crazy as first portrayed. After witnessing Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall in perhaps his best work ever) and the insane chaos that is the Do Nung Bridge, could it be possible that Kurtz isn't as bad as they say? This, of course, is part of the journey and something the audience itself needs to figure out.<br/><br/>All the same, Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest of all films because it goes farther than any of its kind. The helicopter scene when Kilgore's cavalry attack a Vietnamese village is perhaps the most daring and ambitious sequence ever filmed. No film maker or even studio would dare do such a thing, probably instead using CGI to create the effects. But Coppola was a genius and just crazy enough to be able to try such a stunt. Indeed, the whole movie is a crazy stunt and one that you won't soon forget."
"classicsoncall","10","4","5","15 October 2009"," ""What do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin?""
","Back during the Viet Nam War, a friend of mine from my home town returned from the war and described his first day in combat. He was dropped from a helicopter in the middle of a jungle clearing, while simultaneously realizing that the rifle fire coming his way was from enemies that wanted to kill him. I'm not sure how a sane person filters that type of insanity through any kind of rational prism. Perhaps that's what ""Apocalypse Now"" is meant to convey, as virtually every situation presented makes no sense in a rational world. The surreal takes center stage from beginning to end, with river surfing set to a napalm barrage and playboy bunnies appearing out of the night sky aboard a helicopter. For a generation of movie watchers born after the Viet Nam era, scenes like those might seem like the fevered nightmares of a troubled film maker, but for those who lived it, they were all too real. I guess that's why Viet vets referred to 'The World' as anyplace BUT Viet Nam; in today's experience, one might compare that war to a virtual reality video game, except that you could really die in it.<br/><br/>I recall back in the day how Marlon Brando's presence in the film was highly regarded and anticipated, yet for all that he's in it for only a relatively short time. It's Martin Sheen's picture pretty much all the way, with a supporting cast that while watching today, surprised me with the likes of Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishbourne, Harrison Ford and Dennis Hopper. Robert Duvall on the other hand, might have cemented his growing reputation here with his 'napalm smell of victory' declaration early in the picture. His portrayal of Big Duke Six Kilgore is the one I remember best from thirty years ago, even though he winds up merely a marginal character.<br/><br/>Interestingly, if one were to remove the context of Viet Nam, the picture would still hold up amazingly well, given the universal oxymoron of military intelligence in a Catch 22 world. Captain Willard's thoughts and actions turn conventional thinking on it's head, while forcing the viewer to re-examine one's own ideas about good and evil, right and wrong, humanity and inhumanity. It's not a comfortable picture to watch, and one which defies the generally accepted definition of entertainment. Nevertheless it's almost certainly a must see picture that challenges one's perceptions about war and it's consequences."
"nskanyal","10","4","5","12 August 2009"," This movie is not from this world
","Were they not the real soldiers? Was it not the real war? Was that not the real horror? Have the people not really gone insane? Was the movie really made on this planet and by some mortal human beings? Was it a video documentary or was it a movie made 5 years after the real war? Yes, to all of the above, but I have never ever seen any movie so close to reality or actually real. It was not a war movie, it was not a drama, it was simply a deeply touching horror drama. I am still wondering what should I make out of this movie, should I feel anything, should I be sorry about anybody – if yes, about who?? American soldiers, Vietnamese, those tribals, each one of these or nobody? Coppola doesn't leave anything obvious and everything is open to your own interpretation – he is at his arrogant best. Man, it takes inhuman guts to make such a movie or even think of doing it. He was fortunate to supported by such a able and gutsy team of editors, script writer, screenplay writers, cinematographer and so many other people. I am really surprised and disappointed that this movie was not awarded academy for Film Editing – it's as ridiculous as it can be. My head still spins from imagining all these people living in those swamps and malaria invested waters for almost 2 years.<br/><br/>Talking about the cast, I would rather say that movie and its makers go way beyond the cast. Any other actors may have done equal justice (if not less) to the movie. This may sound highly uncharitable, especially to Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall (I don't mention Brando – he was rather a waste, Coppola may have utilized that money somewhere else – am I speaking out of my shoes?? ). Sheen was awesome awesome and hats off to all his effort, and it was rather wise (or fortunate) not to have Al Pacino in his place, but the movie is not about Captain Willard, Col. Kilgore and Col. Kurtz, it about everything around each of them – it goes way beyond all these people.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The End"" will stay as my personal favorite for the most apt movie soundtrack of all times.<br/><br/>10/10"
"eddiez61","10","4","5","27 May 2009"," Fighting Insanity with Insanity
","This comment is for the original cut, Not the Redux version.<br/><br/>The myth of the ""Good War"" still persists, that there can be nobility in the horrendous acts committed in the service of Right. Francis Coppola took upon himself the task of exploring and refuting this notion, and found entry into this harrowing terrain by way of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness."" <br/><br/>In the novel, commercial interests drive the British empire into the depths of the African jungle, and just as deeply into Britian's own severely corrupted soul. The ambitions of a ""civilized"" people have supplanted all notions of decency, Christianity, humanity. In the novel the inescapable corrupting force is the savage ivory trade. The African natives have been reduced to dispensable pawns, fortunate to receive even the most brutal treatment from their colonial masters. This horrendous industry supports a contentedly oblivious Empire. In the film it's the Vietnam war that inexorably disfigures all its participants. And for the great director, the irresistible flame of destruction is his film. Coppola's river of decent became Time, as a projected 15 week shoot in the jungle sprawled to more than 250 grueling days. Repeatedly prolonged by an ongoing brutal guerrilla war, severe monsoon weather, and the near fatal heart attack of Martin Sheen, the shoot evolved into a treacherous marathon, pushing everyone involved beyond their limits. <br/><br/>In the film the character of Kurtz functions as the ideal civilized fighting man: educated, decorated, refined, virile, charismatic, brilliant, formidable. In the novel and perhaps more importantly, Kurtz is an artist; ""essentially a great musician,"" a journalist, a skilled painter, and ""a universal genius."" Coppola, too, is something of a universal genius; a larger than life character of enormous talents and capacities. Though we are ostensibly given access to his personal beliefs through the narrations of Capt. Willard, I suspect that Francis more deeply identifies with Kurtz. After all, Coppola had in fact become a renegade demigod leading a ragged army in the jungle, defying all authority, ruthlessly executing his own brand of creativity. <br/><br/>Studio execs like to consider themselves Highly Principled Creatives. But, in the face of Francis' truly uninhibited, honest excesses they proved themselves to be timid sheep by cutting his budget. They had been complicit in creating the monstrous ego of Coppola and had profited hugely with his ""Godfather"" franchise. But they lost their nerve when they saw what was reflected in the bizarre mirror that Francis was assembling in that Philippine jungle. There were more than a few Studio execs that wanted the director terminated with extreme prejudice. This is perhaps the film's most salient point; that the Enterprise can only be corrupt because its Sponsors are corrupt. And more so, the Sponsors are further corrupted by the Enterprise. Vicious cycle. In the film the home office honchos wanted Col. Kurtz dead because his actions were revealing to them the folly of their own ways. Proof of their depravity is their need to have a great American soldier assassinated. As for Coppola, the Studio was embarrassed by the accurate picture he was painting of their industry; bloated, self-serving, and unprincipled.<br/><br/>Francis commented at the film's Cannes preview that its production was so overwhelming that ""(it) is not about Vietnam, it IS Vietnam."" The herculean effort is evident in every frame. Not an instant passes without a heightening sense of ominous doom. Each klik up the Mekong into Cambodia is a slowly tightening tourniquet on the throat, breath barely moving over dry lips. The aerial battle scenes are absolutely the most grandly choreographed tableaux of grace and destruction ever put to film; an utterly Grotesque Opera. Everything is over-sized, disproportionate, absurd. And most disorienting of all is Brando, himself. <br/><br/>Col. Kurtz (kurtz is German for short) is ill, weakened, compromised, but Brando's creation manages to tower above all else. He seems to be very gently rocking in a wind; a massive ancient sequoia listing to and fro on the verge of a mighty, awesome collapse. Brando/Kurtz is doubly mesmerizing because we only glimpse him in deep shadows and stark profiles. Accounts of the shoot explain that Brando arrived on location at nearly 300 pounds and felt very self conscious of his size, so Francis devised the high contrast lighting to conceal and appease the star. It's a fortuitous concession because it only magnifies his intense psychological presence. It's as though Kurtz is played by the spectre of Brando.<br/><br/>War has long been a compelling topic for films. The visual spectacle and pyrotechnics serve the film medium well. The eternal theme of good versus evil is elegantly displayed against a backdrop of chaos and mayhem. The poignant interplay of suffering and sacrifice, the glory of selfless duty to a country that has our best interest at heart. What 'Apocalypse Now"" attempts is the complete negation of these values. These outdated ideals are so hollow, so feeble compared to what the tender human mind experiences under the influences of war. There is nothing good in war. There is nothing good as a result of war. Even when participation becomes necessary, there is nothing to be gained from war but loss. And what is most lost is our sanity, our humanity. Kurtz's ""Horror"" is not of what he has witnessed in country, but in the hypocrisy of Society and the behavior of the ""Civilized"".<br/><br/>(Important Note: Redux is valuable as an example of how important good editing is. It contains additional scenes that help flesh out the history of Vietnam and the conflict, and attempts to make more human the star characters, but succeeds only in disrupting the rhythm and flow of the original masterpiece. The specifics of the Vietnam war are irrelevant to the larger theme of ""War's"" madness, and feels like a detour. Making Capt. Willard more personable only undercuts the tension that builds along his ""journey"" up the river. See the original cut first.)"
"Phil_N_Stine","10","4","5","5 April 2009"," The Horror, The Horror...
","Colonel Kurtz: ""The horror, the horror"".<br/><br/>Sums the film up perfectly. A pretty disturbing journey into war, madness and the dark side of the human soul, Apocalypse, Now managed to unsettle me several times. At one point, I resented the main character and more or less everyone on the boat. Later on, I felt repulsed and sympathetic for their eventual fates, particularly Chef (who is the character I didn't really resent at any point). The film really succeeds in drawing the viewer into this horrific journey, and the mind of Kurtz himself. The echoing between Kurtz and Willard was very well done, to the extent I wouldn't have been surprised if Willard took Kurtz place (which didn't happen, which makes a lot of sense really). Fantastic opening sequence as well, and a wonderful use of music."
"adrian290357","10","4","5","24 June 2008"," Superlative
","APOCALYPSE NOW is a masterpiece whether you see the truncated earlier version or the more recent, extended version. The direction is superb, the screenplay excellent with its ironical and occasionally over the top depiction of the uselessness of war and of the degradation of moral values. Duvall is memorable as the colonel who loves to wake up to the smell of napalm; Martin Sheen has his best role ever by a mile; Brando is an enigmatic larger than life metaphysic that appears to have won the minds of the enemy but lost his own; the photography is exquisite; and the sequence with the French family in a colonial setting is an absolute treasure. But there is much more to enjoy, from the much repeated helicopter sounds at the beginning of the movie to the vagaries of fighting a war you do not care for. I will always go back to this movie, watch it with pleasure and learn something new from it. A fabulous film that deserves 10/10."

One night, several of us whose time grew short gathered at about 5 PM on a hot, dry season day for cold beer and some smoked weed.

"anonymous124","Null","4","5","1 April 2006"," The 30 Greatest Films Ever Made, Continued
","(part of 30 essays I am writing on the 30 greatest films of all time. They are written in no order) I'm not sure if there could possibly be a more fitting title for this film than ""Apocalypse Now."" The famous opening scene shows a line of trees for about a minute as we hear helicopters chop-chopping in and out of the frame. We begin to hear the first notes to The Doors' ""The End"" and as the first words are spoken the entire forest is hit by napalm and bursts into flame silently. Then it fades on one half of the screen to a shot of Martin Sheen's face, and the helicopters are really the ceiling fan? ""And all the children, are insane! All the children..."" <br/><br/>The first lines spoken in the film is Sheen narrating ""Saigon. (expleteive). I'm still only in Saigon."" He continues to narrate his life story. How he fought in Vietnam, went home. Couldn't stand being away from the jungle. Only word he said to his wife was yes to a divorce. And now he was back here. Still only in Saigon. ""Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker, and every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger. Each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter."" Sheen, drunk, tears apart his room and cuts himself punching a mirror. Having fun yet? The next morning he is in luck - HQ gives him a top secret mission up the river into Cambodia, to kill a Green Beret colonel who has lost his mind and commands his soldiers to commit atrocities while they worship him as a king. Willard narrates: ""I was going to the worst place in the world and I didn't even know it yet. Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable - plugged straight into Kurtz. It was no accident that I got to be the caretaker of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's memory - any more than being back in Saigon was an accident. There is no way to tell his story without telling my own. And if his story really is a confession, then so is mine."" Shoot, who wrote the narration? Because those are pretty classic lines. Make a good Sig but it has to be under a hundred characters. Here's something probably under a 100: ""charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets in the Indy 500."" He is sent up with Chef (Fredrick Forrest), Mr. Clean (a 14 year old Larry Fishburne), Lance (Sam Bottoms) and Chief (Albert Hall), who are all (except Chief) young and inexperienced soldiers. In the films most famous scene, they are chauffeured to the mouth of their river by Robert Duvall and his air Calvary, who bomb a Vietnamese village to clear the area for surfing. The famous detail is that the helicopters are blasting Wagners ""Ride of the Valkeries"" as they attack the village.<br/><br/>From there the film descends, one scene after another, into a world of chaotic insanity and madness. One of the most memorable scenes is when they pass the last American outpost on the river. Soldiers carrying suitcases swim into the river desperately, crying out ""take me home!"" When Willard goes onto the crazily lit bridge (we only see his face every time a flare goes up) he asks a soldier who the commanding officer is. The soldier looks horrified and replies ""Aint you?"" Finally, the film reaches the end of the river. Only a couple of the men are left. Men hang from the trees and skulls decorate the sides of the river. Heads and severed limbs and graffiti (one which says ""Apocalypse Now"") cover the ancient temple. The beret, Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando) recites poetry and Willard is disturbed to discover the many parallels between him and Kurtz. Kurtz's biggest admirer is ""The Photojournalist"" played by Dennis Hopper, who says things like ""You don't talk to the Colonel. You listen to him...he's a poet-warrior in the classic sense."" This is a stunning film to watch, and what is more stunning I can see this again and again and again and never get bored of it.<br/><br/>Original or Redux? There isn't much difference between the two versions. You might want to see Redux for an interesting new way to look at the film (the scenes have been rearranged into a different order) but I would see the original first, which stays closer to the novel on which the film is based, Conrad's Heart of Darkness.<br/><br/>""Arresting a man for murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500""...good line."
"mwm-5","10","4","5","24 March 2006"," Apocalypse Now Redux is the definitive film of the Vietnam War.
","This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the ""war is hell"" cliché, underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel, who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece. In particular, I found the final segment of the journey with Brando, which encapsulates Conrad's Heart of Darkness, to be rather boring. I finally got around to seeing Apocalypse Now Redux and the flaws have been taken care of. Redux makes the movie an outright masterpiece, certainly among the top 100 films ever made. Brando's performance now seems full and complete, perhaps rather less mysterious, but much more profound. Martin Sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled. It's great to spot a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as. The work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage. If you've never seen this film, skip the original and head straight for Redux. I wish we could get a Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece."
"bulleetz37235","9","4","5","9 March 2006"," Make sure it's Redux
","This is a classic war movie. One of the best, a stark image fest of flashing lights, harrowing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades morphing into ceiling fans. A star-studded spectacle of immense power.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen is a mercenary sent up river to assassinate the general gone astray, a sadistic dictator played beyond belief by the great Marlon Brando. Also along for the ride are, Robert Duvall as an over the top DI with a penchant for ""napalm in the morning"" or at least the smell of it. Dennis Hopper is an edgy photojournalist with a view slanted views about the war and about his leader. Also in this amazing film you'll see up and coming stars such as Laurence Fishburne, R. Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall and keep an eye out for Harrison Ford too...<br/><br/>Behind the lens is Francis Ford Coppolla delivering a film with maybe more intensity and drama than the acclaimed Godfather films, he highlights war in it's most basic form, which for the most part is something you can't see, you can only feel it, as the boat carries on up river the feeling of the war tightening in is quite unbearable. The feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really makes for unusual moods from the viewers. Honestly no films has ever made me feel like that.<br/><br/>Criticism is hard to find. The biggest qualm from some is that Brando earned tons of money for a ten minute role, but in all fairness this is unjustified. It was money well earned, a role that physically restricted him, being at the time an unwell man, and a role that he really made his own. I can't picture anyone better for the role. And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version, there's some extra bits of the great man, and I think the Redux does make the film miles better.<br/><br/>Final impressions are that if you are lucky to get the Redux version then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying film with a cool 49 minutes extra footage. If not, then still you won't be disappointed, this film is up there with the best, and deserves some great recognition, and a firm place as one of the top 50 films ever made..."
"Deckard42","10","4","5","5 March 2006"," An incredible masterpiece
","If you haven't watched this masterpiece yet, you missed one of the deepest experiences that a movie could provide. This movie is about war, about politics, about the beauty and the horror, about the human nature in itself. Many have written extensively about it, so I will rather comment on one certain issue:<br/><br/>The Redux version:<br/><br/>Whilst there exist almost only negative comments about it, I think it is even better then the original. The Redux version has been released many years after the original and contains 49 minutes of new footage (taken from the original materials). Coppola explained, he felt the necessity of making this version. Mainly for the fact, that the original version was cut in an atmosphere of extreme pressure and desperation (read about the making if you don't know why). They cut the huge amounts of material to some simple format, leaving out scene after scene in the desperate attempt to make sense of something that could not make one certain sense. The Redux version was meant to give the original some of the hectically cut out footage back.<br/><br/>The new scenes contain nothing that would change the story or meaning of the old movie, instead they either continue the story parts in more details or open up completely new scenes. There is the continuation of the famous Playmate scene for example, showing the perversion and insanity that briefly shines through in the original when the soldiers are heading for the playmate stage. The logical continuation takes place when Captain Willard and company meet the playmates stranded further up the river, being delivered to their goodwill.<br/><br/>Then there are some small additions, like a really intense close up of Marlon Brando, whose acting in this movie is legendary! You will hardly find anything to criticize about these small additions, you could perhaps argue about the changes in background music, but this is mainly a question of individual taste, since the spirit of the music did hardly change. Its still a psychedelic mix of synthesizer sounds and music by the doors.<br/><br/>Now other things, like the rather infamous scene on the French plantation, leave more room for debates. This scene, which was completely left out from the original, opens up a new story part, taking place on a French plantation. In my opinion, this scene added much to the movie's atmosphere, fitting perfectly into its beautiful psychedelic style. Also it was making even clearer that this movie is not simply about war: ""There are two of you, don't you see ? One that kills and one that loves."" This is exactly general Kurtz's dilemma: being caught in a world of insane double morality, looking for a way to find a ""true"" way of acting, Kurtz finally decides to break out by choosing his role as murder, by abandoning the role of jurisdiction in his (a)moral world. At the same time this sentence points to an even deeper conflict inside human nature or the world itsself: The existence of unimaginable horror and beauty next to each other. The desperate situation everyone faces who gets to see both. <br/><br/>Overall, the new scenes do not contain anything that would really change the old movie (whilst there was hardly anything removed from it), whilst in my opinion they add much to it. The movie is longer, it has an even more epic character and becomes an even more breath taking psychedelic trip trough the dark corners of human nature and morality. If you really hate the Redux version, ask yourself why exactly. I think it is pure perfection, as long as you don't judge it simply for the fact that it is a changed version of one of the best movies ever made. Enjoy."

Two years ago me and my friend became obsessed with movie making and movies. First, watching movies that dealt with subjects we were interested in, war and action. Then we got into movies that showed artistic edge in which we had never experienced. Apocalypse Now, one of the hundreds of movies I've watched is still my all time favorite. A masterpiece in cinema, a very edgy movie dealing with Vietnam. The movies starts out dark with a very twisted humorous feeling almost. As we see Martin Sheen travels down the river things become twisted and disillusioned, becoming a symbolic representation of war and life. I give it 10/10, it's not for everyone.

","On first viewing of this film I found the story so awful it was painful to watch. I wanted to forget it; but once seen this film lives on in one's memory. Clearly it is a highly allegorical work as is the novel it is derived from : ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad. It says much about the human condition in general not only within the context of war. Strictly speaking the film charts Willard's path through hell and ultimately to redemption. In reality Martin Sheen, who plays Willard, did practically the same thing. Reputedly smoking and drinking just a shade too much until half way through the filming he suffered a heart attack. Coppola's own path through this jungle of a film was equally harassing (watch ""Hearts of Darkness"" to get a better perspective on the making of the movie) resulting on the shoot taking far longer than originally planned. It's difficult now not to elide fact with fiction when discussing this film. Even before it was released I can remember newspaper headlines asking ""Apocalypse When?"" In the event the film was at last completed with the result that it is probably the most searing war film or any other kind of film you are likely to see. The acting throughout is brilliant from Sheen and Duvall, and fascinatingly quirky from Brando and Hopper. The cinematography is breathtaking and the use of music inspired. I cannot count the number of times I have seen it and it still thrills and enlightens me. A must for any DVD collection. P.S. Don't see the REDUX version."

","It is difficult for me to write a comment for ""Apocalypse Now"". The numerous reviews that have been made by prestigious critics and experts about this monumental film since its release, make my comments seem a bit redundant. Nevertheless, I strongly feel obliged to submit some thoughts about this fantastic movie.<br/><br/>First of all, I subscribe to the view expressed by many, that ""Apocalypse Now"" is one of the best films in the history of cinema. It combines many things: Drama, action, emotions, art, mysticism, scenery, philosophy, are some elements that come in mind when one talks about ""AN"". In fact, there are so many angles that this film can been seen through, that it is nearly impossible to categorize it: Is it a war film? Is it a philosophical one? Is it an art movie? ""AN"" partially fits in lots of categories, and doesn't fully fit in any one of them at the same time...<br/><br/>Under the masterful direction of Coppola, ""AN"" recounts the story of Capt. Willard (Sheen), who while serving in Vietnam, is ordered to carry out a rather unconventional mission: He must find and ""terminate"" Col. Kurz (Brando), an erstwhile brilliant officer, who has now gone insane; Kurz has gathered a private ""army"" by locals who worship him like a god, and he has disappeared with them somewhere in Cambodia. Willard begins his journey with a handful of accompanying sailors, and during their voyage they encounter several surreal situations. Moreover, Willard, who is in the border of insanity himself, studies the file of Kurz and starts to deeply admire the man. What will happen when he finally meets him?<br/><br/>I wouldn't need here to say anything about the breath-taking performances of Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando, as they are the point of reference for many drama classes. I would only like to add that ALL the performances in ""AN"", are worthy of the film's status.<br/><br/>There many things to be said about ""AN"", and as I explained in the beginning, if someone wants to explore further, there are several sources to look at. The only thing I would like to add here before concluding is that this is a film which will never lose its beauty, no matter how many years pass. 10/10."
"Yabier","10","4","5","11 August 2005"," Baring of the human soul
","What can I say about this film is that it's simply one of the best ever. Francis Ford Coppola shows us the deepest emptiness of the human soul that the ruins of war mean. If you have read Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", the book in which the movie's concept is based, you will understand the parallelism between the original and the Marlon Brando's Kurtz, the character who symbolizes the greatest and the lowest of the human being.<br/><br/>I want to write a meaningful comment, that's because I'm going to talk about the metaphysical part of this movie. There is a lot of comments talking about the movie itself, so read them if you are looking for that.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is a war movie that encloses a deeper story; the journey of a man who is caught between war and peace, death and life, and doesn't find any meaning for both of them. When his superiors task him an extra-official mission, he is involved in the chase of a ghost, a man who is apparently mad but whose actions in the current war seem to be brilliant. Captain Benjamin L. Willard finds himself chasing a man who admires in order to kill him, although he doesn't know what he will do when he faces Kurtz. In his path Willard have to confront the horrors of war, which degenerate forth to complete madness, nonsense and death like the most terrible nightmare.<br/><br/>The rest is history. I think that the Redux version adds darkness and daze to the original Apocalypse Now, deepening more in its real meaning; not only an anti-war movie but the baring of the human soul."

I was hypnotized by the scene of darkness and the nihilism that the movie showed. The direction of Francis Ford Coppola was just incredible, the actors were brilliant.

It also blends images, music, and moods well not to mention has great special effects that look like the movie was filmed during the war. Redux version offers us a little more into the characters. One of my favorite lines in Redux is when the crew asks Willard if he likes it hot while ditching the air cavalry. He replies by saying "" it's sure as ---- better than seeing what you can become in some factory in Ohio."" Willards journey into the jungle makes him start realizing how Kurtz the renegade colonel has been affected by the war into what seems like insanity but is clarity. "" Never get off the boat.

Sheen is something to behold and it wasn't until I witnessed this film I understood the emotion he could convey on screen. You could say Hopper, Duvall and Brando have almost cameo like rolls... and you'd be wrong. They were used to their potential and you have to disregard the fact that their screen time was limited. This film is a brilliant spectacle. Hardly ever does a person examine life on the scale of life and after seeing Apocalypse Now, you will never be able to see war on the scale of war.

I find this film to be a commentary on the dispute between Conrad-who set a meditation on the void at the heart of European society-in Africa and Achebe who found this an affront for the same reason; the Africa of the story is rather distant and the Africans shadows in the distance. Not only do the Europeans nick the continent off its rightful owners but they don't even give the locals a cameo appearance! This is reflected in the film where Vietnamese people exist to get shot or fall for Kurtz's not so crypto-fascism. By the last third of the film the action is in Willard's head-will he join Kurtz like Colby the first assassin-or do the suits' dirty work. He does neither-killing Kurtz allows Kurtz to expiate his sins and release the locals from their false God at the same time releasing Willard from his dependence on the suits for a ""mission"".

A lot of people debate whether it's a ""war movie"" I take the position that it's a war movie but that's only part of it.  I think calling it only a ""war movie"" is taking away from how great this movie is.  It doesn't just have the simple ""war is hell"" message that many war films have.  It asks more piercing questions about human nature and character.  It is drama, war, action, art, and manages to be entertaining as well as thought provoking.  Even if the ideas don't grab you there are 3 things you cannot deny of this movie. 1)the acting is all top-notch  2)the cinematography is some of the best ever 3)it is well written.

"Old Joe","Null","4","5","8 October 2003"," This is a groundbreaking masterpiece of a movie.
","Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now' is one of the most controversial movies that our world has been privileged to see. I have heard many rumours about what happened on the set of this film, causing many problems, but I believe that does not distract from how good a movie I think it is. But I warn you, Apocalypse' has a very long and confusing story that might make it hard for you to appreciate what Coppola was trying to show. There have been many war movies made by Hollywood, but none are quite like this.<br/><br/>
Nominated for 8 academy awards, Apocalypse Now tracks the journey of Captain Willard, a US Army intelligence officer sent on a hazardous mission up river in Cambodia to terminate with extreme prejudice' an American renegade, a colonel named Kurtz' who has spun out of control (and out of his mind!), in a remote jungle compound. <br/><br/>Apocalypse Now was really well made by Francis Ford Coppola (as director, producer and screenwriter). Coppola had many moments in the film where he wanted to say something and that is what he did. I love the way he shot the war scenes in this film, as they were not only very dramatic, but also very funny as well. I am certain that he was trying to deliberately show the irony of war', a real highlight of the film. <br/><br/>Helping Coppola write the film's screenplay were Michael Herr and John Millus. They all did a fantastic job, incorporating the mind-boggling story of Hearts of Darkness', by adventurer Joseph Conrad. It is my view that this story, while being hard story to understand, is important for people to learn about. All the writers did with this story was replace the trip up the Congo Marlow has in the HOD' story, with the river trip thorough Cambodia for Captain Willard and his crew. Some people could criticise this movie's story, saying that Coppola used it for his own convenience. However I think it is good to try and learn about an old story, in a modern kind of way, in a story that has undoubtedly affected our world, for many years now.     <br/><br/>
This movie shows many characters that have gone mad (or indeed are about too end up that way!). Its main star is Willard (Martin Sheen), the captain that is given the unenviable task of trying to find the ex-army colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). While Sheen was good in certain parts of his role, I must say that I found Willard to be a very mysterious character that lacked in dialogue. For me, this made him very hard to like. <br/><br/>A lot has been said about the small role taken on by legendary actor Marlon Brando. He might have been paid one million dollars for the performance, but he does show he was the right person for the job. I believe Brando comes across perfectly as this army colonel, gone insane. When Brando says The horror, the horror', it brought back some fond memories of the HOD' story for me. It is also funny to see the Photojournalist (Dennis Hopper), who is a really strange guy, harassing Willard when he finally finds Kurtz at his jungle hideaway. This character is another man that could be considered crazy', as all his actions signal that to me.<br/><br/>The other cast members in the film take a lot less of the limelight in the film, as that is how the story wants them to be. But they still do have an impact at certain times of the movie. At the beginning of the film we meet a few officials that give Willard his mission. One of them is a Colonel (a very young Harrison Ford). Then on the boat that is helping take Willard on his mission through the Cambodian river are Chef (Frederic Forrest), Chief (Albert Hall), the boat driver, Lance (Sam Bottoms) who has a disturbing death scenes, and Clean (an almost unrecognisable Laurence Fishburne), whose death is much more dignified than that of the chief. <br/><br/>When we see the war zone in Vietnam for the first time, we meet a most unusual personality, Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall). The scene with the Kilgore in it at the earlier stage of the movie, is truly great, as we see the war going on around him (with no shirt on mind you), but what is even more amazing is that he tells his officers around him, it is ok to surf, get out there or fight'. Now in any normal war film, that would be the last thing on anyone's mind, let alone an order from a top ranking official.<br/><br/>
However, the most disturbing scene in the film happens when the navy boat crew stops, suspicious about the occupants of a Vietnamese boat. The massacre that follows is very hard to watch, but it does show what can happen, when men are trained to fight and kill in war. Willard as Captain shows absolutely no compassion to these people at all.<br/><br/>
I am not worried if there are people out there that hate this movie, but I hope you at least gave it a chance before feeling that way. I hope that in some way my review has given you an insight into what the film is about. I must reiterate that this film has an historical story attached to it. If you are a fan of literature, I can only recommend you read the Hearts of darkness' story, but be ready for heavy bit of reading. If this movie gets a bit heavy for you, keep reminding yourself what it is trying to show - Captain Willard and his mission, which is to find this brilliant army colonel that has gone completely mad and kill him. This is a brilliantly made film, with a remarkable story, cast and direction. I can only recommend you that you see it.<br/><br/>CMRS gives Apocalypse Now': 4.5 (Very Good  Brilliant Film)"

","I have just finished reading an interview with Vittorio Storaro, cinematographer for Apocalypse Now, and I am in a state of shock. Apparently, the plan, when preparing Apocalypse Now Redux, was to keep the original negative intact, and to edit the new material into a freshly struck inter positive. Unfortunately, the negative, 25 years old, was starting to fade, and Storaro was concerned that new prints would not be up to his, or the audience's, high standards. He suggested to Coppola that they re-edit directly into the original negative. This, of course, would eliminate the need for an inter positive, and allow for beautiful new prints to be struck. On the other hand, the original negative in its ""classic"" incarnation would be gone forever. Storaro asked Coppola, ""Let me know one single thing, in the future, in 10, 20, 50, 100 years from now, which version would you want the audience to see?"" And he said, ""This one.""<br/><br/>I remember asking myself why the additional footage couldn't have been relegated to the ""Extras"" section of a DVD. My guess had been that the entire affair was a cynical attempt stir up interest in a theatrical re-release in order to make a few more bucks for the perennially cash- hungry Coppola. Would that he had been so cynical. Now we will never have the chance to see a beautiful new Technicolor dye transfer print of the original Apocalypse, a genuine classic, because Coppola actually thinks that the god-awful Redux, a bloated, ponderous, amateurish mess, is the version for which he should be remembered.<br/><br/>I have seen the original Apocalypse dozens of times, and each time it has felt fresh, vital, visionary. I almost walked out of the theater during Redux. Like mold, the new footage had corrupted the old, making the whole film dank and dreary. Most of the new footage was hasty, improvised, and pointless, and integrated badly into the whole. The performances resembled juvenile acting class exercises. The legendary French Plantation scenes were so over the top and silly that I thought an unused sequence from Monty Python's The Meaning of Life had been dropped into the film.<br/><br/>As Paulette Goddard once said of Chaplin, ""(Coppola) sometimes thinks he thinks."" Despite his reputation as a rebellious visionary, Coppola has always done his best work for hire. When he has been allowed to go off the rails, he has produced crap fests like One From the Heart (which I actually saw in a theater) and Redux. Looks like it was only the pressure to deliver that prevented box office disaster and bankruptcy in 1979. I, like many others, have spent the last 25 years waiting for another Coppola masterpiece. From the evidence in the Storaro interview, we have all waited in vain. The man's judgment is faulty. Maybe if he can get back together with Bob Evans..."

"tml_pohlak_13","2","19","37","15 June 2009"," The horror... The horror... of overrated movies...
","If there has ever been an overrated director, Francis Ford Coppola is the one. Apocalypse Now is nearly universally praised as one of the greatest war films of all time. I consider it to be one of the most overrated movies of all time; far from a masterpiece, it merely cashes in on the American anti-war sentiment of the time.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the film's story itself, shall we? Well, although adapted from fantastic source material (Conrad's Heart of Darkness), Apocalypse Now has a very vague plot joining the film. As I have learned, the film was plagued with production problems, which may be why this is so. Either way, the film is comprised of a few interesting scenarios (I particularly liked the boat massacre) tied together in an extremely convoluted way. The story makes no sense, because it's practically irrelevant— too much side material takes away from a promising plot.<br/><br/>I've said time and time again that Coppola has a very feeble grasp of suspense. During the duration of Apocalypse Now, what does the hero, Willard, do? He watches. What does the audience, therefore, do? We watch Willard watching. The increasing chaos downriver is not a magnificent suspense builder. To be honest, it's sheer boredom.<br/><br/>And what of the characters? Willard is a character made out of cardboard. All he does is frown and think about his mission. I couldn't empathize with him at all, and frankly didn't care whether he was successful in his mission or not. His crew is a ragtag bunch of sketched-in, half realized, uninteresting characters. Robert Duvall's character has fantastic potential, but emerges as uninteresting: he appears, demonstrates Coppola's point that the military is a bunch of hypocrites, and disappears, all without contributing much to the plot<br/><br/>Another thing: a novelist's approach does not work in films. The drama should be performed, and not narrated. Although voice-over proves effective at times, Apocalypse Now is one great big, long voice-over that quickly becomes stale, boring and ineffective.<br/><br/>Another thing: the film supposedly ""truly captures"" the insanity of war. No. What it does is ""subtly"" point out the hypocrisy of the American army. They eat meals that the guys in the field would die for. They were planning to punish Kurtz for his murder of four civilians, but praised him once the press got a hold of the story. They send Willard out to kill Kurtz because he's half insane already. There's no leadership at the bridge. The soldiers go absolutely insane over the Playboy ""playmates"" instead of concentrating on the war (that was one of the film's most disturbing scenes-- not in a good way). A man indiscriminately shoots down innocent Vietnamese peasants. Robert Duvall's character attacks a village because the beach has ""the best waves"" for surfing. Far from subtle, it points out exactly what Apocalypse Now is: a cash cow for Hollywood after the anti-war movement.<br/><br/>And now for the good bits: After over two hours of insane boredom, Marlon Brando appears AT LAST. After two hours of watching Willard watching the ""insanity"" of the war, I was glad for a character of interest. Most of Brando's dialogue was, apparently, ad-libbed, and you can tell. His dialogue does not reek of Coppola's mediocre (or just plain bad) screen writing. That is the film's one redeeming quality: only due to Brando (whom I, ironically, consider the most overrated actor ever) is the last 20 minutes of any interest whatsoever. There is one other redeeming quality, and that is the boat massacre. Truly the film's strongest scene, it is sadly followed by a trail of disappointments that all but drown it out.<br/><br/>The Verdict: Far from a masterpiece, Apocalypse Now is barely coherent. Coppola apparently described the film as ""not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam"". Incorrect. It is Hollywood raking in profits after Vietnam. It's no use accusing me of simply not understanding the movie's point, or of having to watch it again. (I'll live quite comfortably if I never hear of the film again.) As a matter of fact, I've seen it three times: the first in my film class, where I despised it, and had to study it and its ""messages""; the second on my own, where I appreciated it a little more, but not by much; the third prior to writing this review, where I returned to my original position. To be blunt, I don't like Apocalypse Now at all.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 2/10 (Brando's segment alone guarantees the 2)"

","I saw the 1979 version first, and recently both this and the Redux version. The original is a much more powerful film so I'll address it first. <br/><br/>First off, this is not a movie about the grunt experience. It's a sweeping overview of the entire war, filtered through the experience of one airborne Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen), assigned to a special mission to off a renegade Special Forces colonel (Marlon Brando). <br/><br/>This film covers in short vignettes many of the contradictions of Vietnam: 1. The opening scenes deal obliquely with the difficulties of Vietnam vets in dealing with life back home. 2. The contradiction between bombing peasants out of their homes and relocating them while telling them that ""we are here to help you!"". 3. The distinction between the US forces bringing massive firepower onto positions against guerrillas that bring down expensive helicopters with suicide attacks with grenades. 4. The relative luxury of US soldiers in the field (with radio, tapes, dope, motorcycles, booze, flown-in steaks, surfboards, and Playboy centerfold shows) vs. the Viet Cong R&R consisting of ""cold rice and rat meat"". 5. The refusal of American military and political leadership to recognize that the conflict could only be settled by total war or political settlement, or that the Viet Cong movement was not linked seriously to either Soviet or Chinese Communism. <br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" delivers these messages in a series of powerful visual montages: the opening scene with the 'thwock-thwock' of chopper rotors melting into the sound of an overhead fan; quiet, peaceful looking rainforest exploding under a napalm attack; the exquisite charge of an airborne unit descending on a VC village in a hail of bullets and Wagner; a quiet boat ride upriver interrupted by hell breaking loose in gunfire, or the sight of the tail section of a downed B-52 rising up out of the fog. <br/><br/>But the key line of the movie is the one delivered by Brando: ""You're neither (an assassin or a soldier). You're an errand boy, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill."" A brilliant summary of the US Army brass at that time. <br/><br/>The movie leaves open the question of whether Kurtz was truly insane, or whether he simply went beyond his purview because he recognized that the only way to defeat the Viet Cong was to be as brutally committed as they were -- that is, total war and obliteration, which would have been politically unacceptable to the US public. <br/><br/>The 1979 version is one of my favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>The Redux version is an excellent example of why movies are edited. It includes a couple of sexually-based episodes, one with the Playboy girls in an abandoned medevac unit, the other with a group of French colonists. I'm as much of a fan of seeing female nudity as the next guy, but neither scene advances the story, so it was wise to delete them. <br/><br/>There is also an extended scene involving a funeral for 'Clean' and a dinner with a group of French plantationers expounding on the pre-history of the US involvement. I can see that it also would have been a distraction from the feel of the movie, which is a shame because I suspect even now that few Americans know about what happened prior to US entry and how the US supported the Viet Minh (later Viet Cong) to fight against the Japanese in WW II. (Sound familiar?)<br/><br/>The one real mistake in the movie was including Dennis Hopper as the spaced-out photojournalist hanging out with Kurtz. I love Hopper, but his character was totally unnecessary here. Laurence Fishburne is remarkably unrecognizable as the skinny boat gunner Clean. And Robert Duvall chews up the scene as the AirCavalry colonel."
"johntheg123","10","5","7","7 December 2006"," Redux was necessary to tell entire story
","I believe most if not all the extra scenes Coppola added were needed in Apocalypse Now Redux. Each scene I believe tells an important truth about life, death, and the horrors of war. The playboy camp is important, and it does not interfere with the the main story. The engine of the boat is broken, so they have to stop for a while to fix it. At that point, Willard makes the decision to trade fuel for sex. This is not out of Willard's character, because he seems rather charitable throughout most of the story. The scene between Lance and Chef with the girls is important because the viewer becomes those characters, and the scene itself is a game in which the girls are saying something important about exploitation, yet their naked bodies distract the viewer from this important enlightenment, just like Lance and Chef are oblivious to the same fact.<br/><br/>The french plantation is also important because it helps give the view of the Vietnam war from the perspective of a neutral party not involved in the war. The scene with Willard and the french woman was implored to somewhat help Willard find out who he really is on the inside. Which also explains why he's nice and brutal at the same time.<br/><br/>The Scene where Kurtz is reading Time magazine to Willard is meant to show the fallacy of propaganda. Despite the terrible outcome of the Vietnam War, the paper media was rather hesitant to show that. It is also parallel to today's ongoing war in Iraq, where there is a conflict between what is actually happening, and what is being told to the people what is happening. <br/><br/>Over all, Apocalypse Now is a story about how and why we lost the War. It is also a story about going down the river of life, and stopping at the horrors and happiness along the way. The entire movie is a metaphor and the movie itself it filled to the brim with philosophical lessons about life."
"robzitnik","9","5","7","19 March 2006"," A marvelous bit of surrealist movie-making...
","This film is arguably one of the most important cinematic achievements of the 20th century. Based on the book ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad this movie is a provocative display of the Vietnam War and the surreal, yet utterly human experiences of its combatants. In the story, Lieutenant Willard (Martin Sheen) travels down a river to seek and assassinate the crazed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has isolated himself from U.S. forces in a remote outpost. As Willard gets closer and closer to his prey though, he finds himself idolizing and obsessing over the invisible, god-like figure of Kurtz rather than preparing to kill him. <br/><br/>What sets this movie apart from other war movies is not its ""hell no, we won't go,"" theme that appears in films such as Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket,"" nor its ""no guts, no glory"" theme that appears in movies such as ""Patton."" Instead, it is its dreamlike portrayal of war as an experience which brings out our most savage, yet undeniably, our most natural tendencies. Everything from the soundtrack, to the screenplay, to the acting furthers the notion that every person who spends time in a war begins to understand the most basic of human desires, and learns to eliminate their consciences. And this, evidently, is ""the horror"" that Willard refers to throughout the film. <br/><br/>The sweeping scenes of the blazing jungle, and the incessant whir of helicopter blades, are mere supplements to the brilliant performances of Brando, Sheen, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, and Dennis Hopper among others. This movie in itself is a dangerous odyssey, for it takes more than a clever film critic to truly understand its importance. The message is hidden deep in the jungle and takes a keen eye to divulge and appreciate. This is a movie about escape from civility, ""the end of our elaborate plan,"" and a descent into chaos and madness, the only question is, are you ready for the Apocalypse?"

","I'm a 16 yr old teenager and i gotta say that this movie straight out fried my brains. Someone told me that this movie was said to be the most realistic thing to the Vietnam War and i can understand why. The madness of it all just scars you, it makes you really think. The chaos is to much for the mind. After i watched this movie i just sat there in silence and thought ""..........woah........"". This is film-making outside the box. Martin Sheen is brilliant and takes us on the journey with him, the boat crew is great each of them is an individual, Marlon Brando is just mind-blowing, scared me to death, I was left in suspense every scene in case he had another outburst of rage.<br/><br/>This isn't a movie where you say to yourself ""i need to kill some time, so i'll watch it"", this isn't a movie to watch with a bunch of friends (maybe if you're high). No. You really have to prepare yourself for this.

"tieman64","Null","6","9","19 August 2008"," This was a valued rug
","Francis Ford Coppola, once the most praised and powerful director in Hollywood, entered the Southeast Asian jungle to make a movie. Armed with Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", a small army of technicians, and a 15 million dollar budget, he emerged ten months later with thousands of hours of footage, two nearly dead actors and a nervous breakdown.<br/><br/>The cause of all this personal trauma was ""Apocalypse Now"", a film in which Martin Sheen is sent up a river and into the jungles of Vietnam to find Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a Special Forces officer who has gone insane.<br/><br/>Conrad's message was that savagery and apathy can wipe out the fragile gains of civilization within a single generation. A thin line stands between civilization and total collapse. Inject a little bit of barbarism, a little bit of chaos, and everything falls apart. Coppola's film tries to build on this, and states that America's inability to relinquish the trappings of civilization (ie- to get out of the boat), ensured its defeat. We lost because we weren't, as a nation, prepared to commit genocide. We committed horrors, but we weren't prepared to go all the way.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with ""Apocalypse Now"" is that it was written by John Milius, the pro-war, gun toting ultra conservative whom the Coen Brother's based their character Walter Sobchak (from ""The Big Lebowski"") on. At the end of Milius' script, Kurtz and Willard team up to fight America. They represent the warrior savage, free from hypocrisy but lost in the darkness.<br/><br/>Coppola, of course, found Milius' script largely silly. He removed Milius' violent ending and went in search of something more powerful. For some grand statement on war and human nature. But he found none. How could he? You can't paddle down a straight line for 10 months and then suddenly expect to reach a new destination.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, ""Apocalypse Now"" tells us one thing, but shows us something else. The Colonel Kilgores of the picture actually fight the war, whilst the powerful warrior God, Col Kurtz, does little beside chopping the limbs off natives or hiding in the shadows. Milius' script saw Kurtz as the hero. A wise and seasoned rebel warrior who sticks his fingers up to the hypocritical veneer of civilization, but Coppola seems unwilling to go down that route. <br/><br/>Coppola's ""redux"" cut of the film, though badly paced, is more interesting. It adds a French plantation scene which attempts to contrast the French period of colonial rule with America's war in Vietnam. The problem with this is that US involvement in Vietnam and the Colonial mindset of nineteenth century Europe, as seen in ""Heart of Darkness"", are completely different. American policy wasn't inspired by colonial aims but by ideological ones. The American experience in Vietnam was the opposite of Conrad's colonial experience. No wonder Coppola couldn't find a suitable ending. There isn't one. <br/><br/>Late in the film, Kurtz accuses his country of hypocrisy. They are unwilling to fully embrace the darkness. If he were given a small army of savages, he says, then the war would be over tomorrow. The implication is that the Vietnamese were nothing more than barbaric savages who should be dealt with, not civility, but primal brutality.<br/><br/>Worse yet, Coppola's ""war"" is one of gorgeous cinematography and exciting spectacle. When a Vietnamese village is raided, it feels more like the Death Star trench run than a savage massacre. Killgore himself is a figure of fun rather than the monster he should be. Milius' script painted a much darker character (hence kill and gore).<br/><br/>Still, ""Apocalypse Now"" may contain no truths about Vietnam or war in general, but it is a film absolutely dripping with passion. Like ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"", ""Apocalypse Now"" is very much a Werner Herzog film. Herzog was a mad artist who wanted to lift a boat over a mountain. Why lift the boat over the mountain? No reason. He simply wanted to do it in the name of art!<br/><br/>Same thing with Coppola. He wanted to do ""somthing"" great. He went into the jungle, went insane and came out with a couple thousand hours of mad footage. What is the merit of this footage? The merit is in surviving the journey. In making it down the river and back out again.<br/><br/>And so what we have is a film about its creators. A film about the madness of the white man. The madness of the director. The madness of the crew. Ironically, the film's madness is all a result of indulgence. The indulgence of a staggering budget, studio leeway, accessible drugs, limitless resources and a giant ego. It's the shallowest kind of insanity. The insanity of unlimited power and a lack of boundaries.<br/><br/>8/10 - ""Apocalypse Now"" ultimately amounts to nothing more than a series of memorable set-pieces. These set pieces don't enrich one another or gel in any way. It's an incomplete film, and even Coppola admits that he didn't quite know what he was doing or tying to say. The film goes up the river but doesn't know why.<br/><br/>Far more interesting is ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"", a documentary shot in tandem with the film. As a study in ego-maniacal madness it's far more powerful than Coppola's film. Narrated by Coppola's wife, it's also very intimate and perceptive. It's also interesting to see how much Coppola relied on Brando's improvisational skills, hoping desperately that the great actor would whip up some kind of climax out of thin air. Brando, of course, was just in it for the huge pay cheque.<br/><br/>Though a failure, this film is worth multiple viewings."
"you_smell360","9","6","9","26 October 2005"," Stunning
","Last year at school, everyone was talking about this movie and everyone was saying how good it was so I had to see it. My friend burnt me it and I hated it, I thought it was boring. I was some what disenchanted after watching it expecting a really action packed movie. The first hour didn't disappoint but after that it was boring. I was only 15 then and I never really got over what a let down it was.<br/><br/>So, for English I picked this film as a related text. This time I knew what to expect and this time I was really impressed and touched by the film. I think it had something with me being an age older. This time I actually listened to what they said and it made the story much more fascinating and bearable to watch, in fact it even moved quickly.<br/><br/>The storyline of this film is very simple. Based on on the book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, who has lost all hope in humanity is given the unenviable mission of traveling up the Nang river in order to bring the wayward Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando) under control. As the film progresses the viewer is confronted with numerous scenes raging from insanity to chaos, which not only shock, but make you reflect and sometimes even disturb you. An example is when they come to an outpost, the soldiers jump in the water screaming to be taken away from their perspective of hell. Another scene, is when Lance puts war paint on. When questioned about it he says ""they're everywhere"", which is ludicrous when you think about it, because he is not in the jungle and could easy been picked off in the boat.<br/><br/>Some of the films concepts are hard to be grasped and I wont go into them here. Suffice to say, it is better left for you to find out yourself. Apocalypse Now is sometimes said to be an inaccurate film about Vietnam and that films like Platoon are more accurate. That is not true though. The film accurately shows Vietnam, as a place literally gone mad. A war without any purpose other than the evil motivations of politics and the army. It is hard for the characters and the viewer to find hope in this film, because in Vietnam, there was none for the soldiers. This film is beautiful it really shows what the human mind is capable of, and if you can understand it, you will be changed forever by this powerful and moving film.<br/><br/>Simply STUNNING"

","Beware, my friends.  Though bold and striking, this is not a movie that should show its face in the new millennium or any era of artistic expression evolved beyond adolescence.  Casual film-goers will probably be impressed at the scenery, the grandeur and the theatrics as I was when I was 16.  But years later, I've matured a bit, and I am absolutely horrified and sickened at how I was duped.  (It's not unlike the feeling of rummaging through your old 80s wardrobe and seeing those ""cool"" parachute pants, acid-washed jeans and Miami Vice sockless-loafers accusing you from beyond the grave!)<br/><br/>Not all of you, but an (enlightened?) minority WILL BE OFFENDED by this movie.  Certainly the veterans of Vietnam will smell something rank about how Mr. Coppola made such a pretentious carnival out of that truly humbling and difficult time.  But what I found utterly damning of this film, despite the best efforts of performers, were the atrocities that Mr. Coppola committed for the sake of his magnum opus.  A bull was slaughtered live and on camera just for some added gore (of which there is no shortage in this movie).  Acres of beautiful, Filipino countryside were ignited with Hollywood napalm (gasoline).  And last but not least, an entire culture was slandered beyond belief to a degree from which they may not have yet recovered.<br/><br/>A few years ago, a New York radio personality gained enormous popularity with his irreverent and vulgar on-air antics.  I admit that at the time I was amused by the novelty, but then I grew up.  It may be a few decades yet, but I have enough faith in human/artistic evolution that this movie will similarly be relegated to its proper place as a monumental but shameful part of our ever-growing history.<br/><br/>My advice to those of you with unquenchable curiosity?  Before contributing to the popularity and profits of this production (as I foolishly did), borrow a copy of this movie from someone and watch it secretly, as you would a horrible car wreck on the side of the road."

","It includes added footage that absolutely wreaks havoc with the original story line and, more crucially, character development. That said, the original (which I saw in 1979 in what was then a rare widescreen cinema,) is still the best Vietnam movie of all time. I've always considered the trip up river, and the way events get more and more surreal and insane the further up the river they go, as a metaphor for the the entire American experience in Southeast Asia. Every performance is a gem -- it's especially cool to see a very young Lawrence Fishburne in his debut role. Coppola was never this good again."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>It would be overly-simplistic to call this film intense. It is visually and physiologically intense in the hands of a director who took bold chances and with top actors in the prime. While many describe this film as a surreal look at war, many others call it realistic as war can be that insane. Nevertheless, the Army assigns Captain Willard (Sheen) to make his way up the Nung River to locate and assassinate a highly intelligent and decorated officer Col. Kurtz. (Brando). The film is about the journey up stream and the bizarre, brutal, surreal and unexpected encounters that cross their path. Many unforgettable scenes yank emotion from the viewer accompanied by an effective and at times novel music score.

The remastered bluray release and the 4k final cut is the scope ratio that most people saw in wide release and on tv and i'll have to watch the final cut to see if its the best version of this movie, which was originally penned at six hours before Copolla cut it down to around 3 hours. The film became Copolla's most provacative work a year after The Deer Hunter won for best picture, becoming the first but not last movie based on Vietnam to win an Oscar. A documentary borrowing a title from the novel that inspired this movie, Heart of Darkness, was made for vhs and became a hit.

"ksbarcafani","10","2","2","3 October 2019"," ""Eventually, the war is going to end""
","Even 40 years after its release, this film still gives me the chills in a way that nothing else can. As Coppola said, the purpose of this film was to ""give its audience a sense of the horror, the madness, the sensuousness, and the moral dilemma of the Vietnam war."" After a whopping 202 minutes of haunting sequences one after another, this film surely delivers to fulfill its purpose. This is the all-time greatest war film for me, of course I love the likes of Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, but this one just manages to show the madness of war in it's own, unique way.<br/><br/>The film was inspired by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. It follows Captain Benjamin Willard, portrayed by Martin Sheen, on a special secret mission to eliminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz apparently went crazy after a long military career, and soon started acting as God and led his own pagan cult in the upper part of the river. Willard, while healing from the mental wounds of his previous Vietnam tour, accepts the task and starts the most disturbing and distressing journey I have ever seen on screen.<br/><br/>The acting is just amazing in this film. Martin Sheen as Willard was just the right man for the role, and it was really strange to see Marlon Brando act as a murdering decapitating maniac after the Godfather. Robert Duvall as Colonel Bill Kilgore delivered a few of the most iconic war-epic scenes ever, and took the madness of Vietnam troops to a whole new level. And to see Dennis Hopper as the crazy photojournalist welcoming the crew to the most haunting place ever, was just better than I could even imagine.<br/><br/>The reason why I think that this movie has developed its own life that still goes on after 40 years of its initial release, is the atmosphere. The cinematography, the long shots and sequences, all the sets end extras, they just create an atmosphere that is rarely seen in cinema. The soundtrack with The Doors, just perfect. They used huge amounts of explosions, fireworks, dynamite, fire and everything to create the most realistic chaos possible. Let's take for example the scene where Kilgore is leading a pack of helicopters with Willard up north, they start playing ""The Ride Of The Valkyries"" from the speakers. That scene lasted for multiple minutes, just soldiers getting ready to face the enemies, with no idea of what's coming. But it was amazing. The whole movie is about chaining these type of gorgeous memorable sequences together, and that is why this movie is one of my all time favourites. I'll duck everytime when I hear ""The Ride Of The Valkyries.""<br/><br/>One thing more interesting to me than the film itself, is its production. Maybe the chaos from the film hits the viewer really hard, because the production was an actual chaos. They started filming in the Filippines, until a typhoon cleared the whole set and they had to build it all again. The infamous scene where the Viet Cong blow up the 150ft bridge wasn't so easy either. The typhoon destroyed the bridge, so they had to build it all over again just to destroy it on film. Martin Sheen suffered a heat exhaustion, and was hospitalized for over a month. They flew in his brother and a load of double actors for him. The films budget, at first, was 12 million dollars, and in the end it cost almost 30 million dollars. Coppola's whole life was at stake, because he had the chance to stop filming when they knew that the budget would be exceeded, but he kept on filming.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an easy film to watch and turn off your brains, this isn't for you. But if you want to see something that makes you think and makes you shiver even after a year from watching it, then this is for you. Just to give a little glimpse on why these scenes are so disturbing, I'll give two examples: 1: They actually filmed a real ritual slaughter of a caribou by the tribe Ifugao. 2: In one scene they raid a local villagers boat, and the people in it were actually refugees who had escaped their country only two weeks ago. Imagine that.<br/><br/>All in all, this was an experience that left me speechless and staring at the empty screen for a long time. The film took 238 days to shoot, and this is how Coppola addressed the crew in the end: ""I've never in my life seen so many people so happy to be unemployed."" I sure was relieved too when the movie ended. A definite 10/10."
"HaSSaN-M-KH","10","2","2","28 September 2019"," A Masterpiece of a movie!! My favorite movie of all time!
","I can watch this movie over and over again and not get bored! This movie in my opinion Coppola's best among all other works including the Godfather' series. If you are a deep thinking person, this movie is going to hit you so hard. However, I would recommend reading the movie's based novel - ""Heart of Darkness"" - first before watching it. This movie is so deep and black in that it isn't a true war movie; it is anti-war and it shows you how dark and heinous a human can be in the state of war. The movie wants you to realize that war is more than just arms battle between people; war is about unleashing the true nature of human beings and that nature is brutish. So, it's more of a psychological and mental experience in watching Apocalypse Now.
I was also amazed by the performances of all the cast especially Robert Duvall. He was amazing in portraying that careless, dead-hearted Colonel despite having only less than 10 minutes of screen time. He deserved the Oscar so Badly!
However, I caution you that this movie is very underrated in that you either like it so much or hate it so much. There is no middle ground! It's a slow, mystic, deep movie that wants you to react deeply. So, if you are going to watch it for the first time, be prepared to get psychologically and mentally disturbed!"

","Francis Ford Coppola was a director who could do no wrong in the '70's thanks to masterpieces like ""The Godfather"" parts I-II and ""The Conversation"" but this movie was very new territory for him as a director but not asa a screenwriter due to the fact that he co-wrote the Oscar winning screenplay for ""Patton"" and with this he succeeded in making one of the very best war movies of all time. The main character of the movie is an Army captain named Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) who is assigned on a classified mission by Gen.Corman (G.D. Spradlin) and Col. lucas (Harrison Ford) to kill Col. Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who is a renegade soldier who has gone completely insane due to the effects that war has had on him, and whose actions are described as ""unsound"". Willard has to go through extremely dangerous territory whether it's going through battles with the help of Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), heading a long river with three other soldiers to help him get to the site of his mission, and finally being at the site of the mission which is a potential deathtrap. This movie isn't your traditional war movie because of the fact that there isn't a lot of battle scenes in it which isn't supposed to be the takeaway one gets from seeing a movie like this but the fact that that war is hell and damages a lot of people mentally. When Willard gets to Kurtz's house he meets a photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) who is totally afraid of Col. Kurtz and an old friend named Colby (Scott Glenn) who has become one of Kurtz's followers. The movie is a masterclass in how a movie should be made with a masterful screenplay, amazing Oscar winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, great performances throughout (especially by Sheen and Brando who deserved Oscar nominations for their work), and of course flawless execution and masterful direction by Coppola. This is one of the best military movies I've seen in a long time along with ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Patton"", ""The Hurt Locker"", ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Platoon"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Twelve O'Clock High"", ""American Sniper"", ""Inglourious Basterds"", and ""The Longest Day"" just to name some prime examples. This is the very best movie of 1979 and one that is sure to not be forgotten anytime soon, it is a true masterpiece."
"willbenson-40152","10","2","2","25 September 2017"," Five out of Five
","Apocalypse Now (1979) is a film that takes place during the Vietnam War, following the quest by a Captain Willard, the protagonist, to find and kill a rogue United States' Colonel that has allegedly gone insane. Captain Willard travels with a band of soldier in the Navy, and along the way, they encounter the Vietcong, native people, other United States troops, and even a wild tiger. <br/><br/>At the start of the film, Captain Willard is tormented by the confines of civilization after having completed one tour in Vietnam already. The effects of PTSD are evident in his struggles, and the detrimental effects of war on a person's mental health are commonly displayed throughout the movie. Several soldiers demonstrate various effects of PTSD, ranging from nervous breakdowns, panic attacks, and warped views on what is moral.<br/><br/>As the plot progresses, the group travels into increasingly hostile territory. At the first encounter of the enemy, the group is escorted to a drop point by an attack squad of helicopters that decimates a small beachfront village. This is the first example of many of the theme of American disregard for the people of Vietnam and the perceived power that Americans had abroad. The theme itself provided social commentary on the immorality of American actions throughout the war; one such example is how, after destroying a village, a band of American soldiers are only concerned with surfing.<br/><br/>As the band of soldiers moves down the fictional Nung River, they are constantly on edge and weary of what lies ahead. A thread throughout the movie is a hazy atmosphere, originating from either fog or smoke from fire/weapons. The hazy atmosphere is symbolic of the uncertainty and indecision the soldiers face as they move through the terrain; for many of the soldiers, there is no clear understanding of why they are fighting, or when they will be able to go home. <br/><br/>In addition to a hazy atmosphere, darkness is another common aspect of the cinematography. Particularly in close shots on the faces of Captain Willard and Colonel Kurtz, shadows and limited light are used to symbolize the pain and conflict the men are feeling from what they see while they are abroad.<br/><br/>The film Apocalypse Now is a thought-provoking movie regarding American involvement in the Vietnam War. The questions the film raises regarding the morality of war and the duties of soldiers are reinforced by showing a number of internal struggles throughout the film. In the context of many archetypal patterns, I would recommend this movie to anyone for a more serious, engaging war movie. Five out of five stars."

Another of the greats that detailed a bloody excursion in the South Pacific; think Full Metal Jacket, The Deer Hunter, and Platoon. However, despite being an ever-popular topic of film, Apocalypse Now presents a unique perspective on the war as it adapts a previously unrelated story.<br/><br/>Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on an ill-defined mission into Cambodia to hunt down Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). A mission wrought with inefficiency and bureaucracy eventually begins to wear on Willard. Kurtz is wanted for murder, but "" charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets in the Indy 500."" During Willard's painstaking trip up river he slowly discovers more about the mysterious Kurtz and the nature of this horrific war. How can you destroy and man who's already destroyed himself? To what lengths will we go to maintain sanity in an insane place? Kurtz flows with the river and sways with the jungle like an omniscient, omnipresent ghost. The familiar puttering of the boat engine is our only form of solace as the vines begin to wrap around us and the water appears to pull us upriver.<br/><br/>The War is put on display as a series of decisions made by four-star generals sitting in air-conditioned offices somewhere. An attempt at traditional war during exceptional circumstances. Desperate times don't call for moderate measures. Kurtz is the wild card and Willard is sent to clean up after him before he becomes a wild card himself. If the Vietnam War was an asylum, the inmates would surely be running it.<br/><br/>Overall, Coppola provides a thought-provoking adaptation of Heart of Darkness. The contemporary nature of the film makes it more approachable than the original story. Despite becoming somewhat of a case-study of movie production problems during filming, Apocalypse Now is undoubtedly one of the best films to come out of the 20th century. It is often the most trying times that provide the most artistic inspiration, and this film is certainly a testament to that."

","The story follows the journey of Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who accepts the mission of travelling to Cambodia and ""terminate with extreme prejudice"" the rogue Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). According to the military, Kurtz has gone insane and was killing American soldiers and he was praised by the local tribe as some kind of god.<br/><br/>At first, Willard thought that the mission would be plain simple.

","Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is an absolute masterpiece. It doesn't really matter which version of the film you watch; the original '79 version, or the restored and extended ""Redux"" cut. Francis Ford Coppola has said that he personally prefers the longer cut of the film which was finally restored in 2001 and added an additional fifty minutes of footage cut from the original release because of it's already long running time of two and a half hours. When I first saw Apocalypse Now I watched the original version and I was instantly taken by it. It was dark, twisted, and surreal and unlike any other war film I had seen before. A few years later I watched the 2001 ""Redux"" version and was a bit disappointed with it initially. The extra fifty minutes didn't really seem to add much more substance to the overall picture and in return just ended up slowing down the film so much that it just dragged on. Since that time I have only watched the original cut of the film on DVD and still love it. It's one of my all-time favorite war films and probably the best Vietnam war film I've ever seen, and if it's not the best, because certainly Oliver Stone's Platoon is another Vietnam war film that I hold in very high regard, but if Apocalypse Now isn't the best film on Vietnam it's certainly the most original, darkest and fascinating.<br/><br/>The film uses Joseph Conrad's novel ""Heart of Darkness"" as the basis for the plot, but setting it in the middle of the Vietnam War. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) leads a top secret classified mission to travel by boat up a long and dangerous river into Cambodia to assassinate a rouge Green Beret officer named Colonel Kurtz, played with a powerfully absorbing intensity by Marlon Brando. Kurtz seems to have gone completely and totally insane, and a local jungle tribe seems to have adopted him and worship him as some kind of God. Along the perilous journey the team encounters many strange and unusual people and places, including a gung-ho Lieutenant Colonel of the Air Calvary named Bill Kilgore, played great by a wild and fun Robert Duvall (in an Oscar nominated performance), that leads an all-out assault on a small village of Vietnamese, which is undoubtedly the most infamous sequence in the film. But that's just the beginning of this bizarre odyssey; as the small group of soldiers makes their way up the river they also meet some Playboy Playmates, and come across a nighttime battle over a destroyed bridge that is nothing but absolute anarchy and chaos, with no one seemingly in control of the combat. And just wait until Captain Willard finally gets to meet Colonel Kurtz, face to face; it's well worth the wait. Oh, and the scene where the cow gets sacrificed, that wasn't faked; that was all done for real.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is a wild and nightmarish vision of hell on Earth. Francis Ford Coppola's vision of the Vietnam War is so strange and surreal it might as well take place on an entirely different planet all together. The performances are all superb, not a single weak link among them. Among my favorites though has to be Dennis Hopper as an American photojournalist with a motor-mouth and always seems to be on the brink of madness. The Oscar-winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal, and crisp with bolder darks and beautifully bright colors that look even better on the new DVD transfer. It looks so good it's actually hard to believe that the film is nearly thirty years old. And the action sequences are just another aspect of the film that seems to hold up amazingly well over the years. The helicopter attack sequence is breathtaking and still impressive, even by today's standards. The music of Apocalypse Now is another pretty interesting topic. It's mostly an orchestral score done with synthesizers and a few rock tunes from The Rolling Stones (""I can't get no satisfaction"") and The Doors (""The End"") and Robert Wagner's classical march ""The Ride of the Valkyries"", which is a piece of music that has become infamous with the film.<br/><br/>I recently re-watched the ""Redux"" cut of Apocalypse Now and must say that I did enjoy it more a second time around. Some scenes, while still feeling long and maybe a bit excessive, don't really feel as uninteresting or unimportant anymore. The additional sequence with the Playmates does still seem to be pretty pointless to me, but the scene with the French plantation now seems to have more of a purpose; of reminding Willard of man's potential for both good and evil. This scene used to seem slow and pointless, now it seems to make a little more sense when you think more about the ending and how important choices of good and evil play out. The extra fifty minutes of restored footage in the ""Redux"" cut seems to add a lot more character development and a little more comradeship to the soldiers, but also it makes the journey up the river longer and more ""tiring"", but in a good way. Personally I like both versions of the film, but choosing which one to watch really depends on what kind of film you're in the mood for. The original cut is more straightforward and to the point. Apocalypse Now Redux is a little more taxing to sit through (running at three hours and twenty two minutes), but has more substance, nudity and truly carries the weight of a dangerous and surreal journey into the heart of darkness. But which ever version you chose to watch, either way it's a masterpiece."

","I saw ""Apocalypse Now"" three-days-in-a-row when it was originally released in what I thought was one of the greatest theaters ever - The Dome in Hollywood. Although it was scheduled for demolition (which actually began), public outpouring saved it. It's saved for major releases, but you can hardly get in. There is ""no seating"" once the reels have begun to roll.<br/><br/>Those early experiences were dazzling to me - I knew immediately this was going to be a classic film which provoked a myriad of opinions in every person who saw it. I suspect<br/><br/>none of us truly understand the layers of human frailty and brutality Coppola was trying to present. His great successes with ""The Godfather"" series made it possible and viable for him to eventually become the film's producer. I don't think anyone else could have done it more brilliantly. While it nearly drove him mad, all of the problems on-set made the movie a much deeper masterpiece. Those who attempt to analyze it, to show us they know the real rationale, are wasting their time - who cares? Younger generations cannot perceive we old ones just could be a lot more sophisticated than is generally thought. The one truth is: ""...the war was being run by a bunch of four-star clowns who were gonna end-up giving the whole circus away"" (Willard) sounds like an adept explanation of our present, nation-building involvement. Dangerous....<br/><br/>I can attest that all of the cast for ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" must have been frightfully traumatized by the months of shooting this film required. I made a film with Frederic Forest (Chef) shortly after it was completed; he was ready for the looney-bin. ""Trivia"" - did you bother to read it? - states Martin Sheen's heart-attack was suppressed news. Brando's shenanigans, for which he's famous, and his unpreparedness for his role truly must have shocked the entire crew - but, his brilliance in his short role is stellar and proves his acting ability is sheer genius. Who else could have done it ? The pictures in the early part of the movie, to depict him when he was able-bodied and thin, were taken from ""Reflection in a Golden Eye"". Heck, we all knew he was obese and penniless - how can that matter? Just his name made us want to run to the theater.<br/><br/>Only one review I read suggested that some of the actual fighters in Vietnam should have been consulted; so far as I've read, NOT ONE PERSON indicated they were in that war. Yet, those troops were drafted and did their ""tour"", but were looked-upon as being morally dead when they returned home. ""Kill upon command"" equals moral zombie. as ""Kurtz"" scribbled, ""drop the bomb - annihilate them all"", I became vengeful after 9/11 and am still struggling to understand that emotion, in full realization every nation possessing atomic weapons would fire-them-off, fearing they'd be next. That's our next ""apocalypse"".......<br/><br/>The reviews of ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" (and the original) are so intelligently written - every person has been drawn into this epic. Those who didn't like any version of it I can't defend. I, too, was immediately a part of the movie from the first sound to the last, in every frame - I watched it again last night and am still emotionally drained. I was on that boat; I was traveling up that river; I was amazed the Playboy gals were on that stage; I was shocked when they killed all the people on the river-boat; I was appalled by the sex-scenes with the Playboy gals; I was undone with each killing of the crew (Albert Hall was great), I saw all of the hallucinations from the drugs, and I'm a teetotaler (wow! for Sam Bottoms!) which allowed the real troops to survive the horror; I understood why the Frenchmen insisted on staying on their plantation and siding with the VCs; I felt the fear of the journey as they neared ""Kurtz's"" compound; I could feel his craze and why the photographer thought he was a genius; I recognized the zombie-like stance of the Cambodians; I was terrified when ""Willard"" first met ""Kurtz""; I bit my tongue when ""Chef's"" head was thrown onto ""Willard's"" lap; I knew ""Kurtz"" kept ""Willard"" alive because he needed the assassination; I picked-up that ""Lance"" was accepted by the Cambodians, freak-like; I knew the assassination was coming when ""Willard"" emerged from the river; I was certain ""Kurtz"" was only waiting; I was terrified after the killing; I expected to be torn limb-by-limb afterward; I rejoiced when ""Lance"" and ""Willard"" began their journey down the river; I am glad none of us know what really happened, later.<br/><br/>To those few who wondered if the killing of the water-buffalo caused an uproar, I had read soon after the film's release it was a religious celebration for the local Filipinos - Coppola's cameras just happened to be rolling. What a piece of drama that fit right into the plot.<br/><br/>All of those actors who were offered the role of ""Willard"" surely must realize they screwed-up by refusing it - or, perhaps they knew they didn't have the stamina nor acting-ability to do it. For those who loved Martin Sheen's narration, he didn't do it: it was his brother, Joe Estevez.<br/><br/>Here is another masterpiece from the 1970s - I see now I must buy the DVD. As one other ""user"" did, I thank EVERYONE who had any part in its coming to the screen - bravo! for the cinematography and sound-track. This film should be shown to every near-adult student - it's nothing they're not familiar with, including sex and violence. Indeed, I'll watch it many times again and revel in its grandeur, grieving that we do not seem to be able to shake-off our animalistic brutality toward people we do not understand - praying fervently we can overcome...."
"TSHunter","Null","2","2","16 July 2006"," Version vs. Version
","I have to admit, the first and only six times I saw the original version of this film (not ""Redux""), I fell asleep during the film. I was convinced that the original film was made catastrophically unwatchable by the muddled and misguided editing. Several of my friends were angry to the respect that I could actually fall asleep to the ""best film ever"", in their opinion. As a result, I was relieved when I found out that there was going to be a release of a new version to theatres, a ""director's cut"", if you will. I purposely waited until it was released on DVD to watch it, and turned the English subtitles on, and I was glad, because I remember lots of the dialog being lost in the original mix (as I think it is also in this as well), but I feel the subtitles help you get through it. You see, I am the kind of person who likes director's cuts, uncensored versions, restored with new footage films, and even letterbox versions, basically the best way a film is intended. There are some exceptions to the rules, like when different editing processes are used, such as ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", which I still think was a mistake that George Lucas didn't correct some of the very noticeable errors in digital vs. analog editing and prints (i.e. he really should have either re-filmed the original Jabba-the-Hut & Han Solo conversation, instead of a digital re-creation and insertion/replacement of an analog filming of someone different {Jabba}, or just kept the scene cut indefinitely), or when studios take control of films and try to make their own edit and commercial cuts, which is almost always monstrous, just as I've heard with Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"". To summarize, it is possible for someone who has issues with this original film to like the ""Redux"" version, if it is for the reasons as I stated, because I feel that ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" actually is a better film than the original ""Apocalypse Now"". Yes, I am bold enough to say it. I am positive that this will offend people who think the original cut is the ""best film ever"", and I know it is even probable they won't like -this- version, but I don't care about that, just like I didn't rate this version 5-stars, or even think of it as the ""best film ever"". This film clearly travels the waters between pure evil and insane genius. This is the only version worth watching. 8/10"

","I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981, as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrayal of the young Captain. This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History. ""Charlie Don't Surf"". Robert Duvall's famous line (the other one) does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition. It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks."
"The_Triad","8","2","2","29 June 2006"," 1,2,3, what are we fighting for?
","It's that film that loads of people hail as a classic - Apocalypse Now, now a re-cut, re-up, Redux 22 years after it's original release.<br/><br/>The film is loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness, it's main plot (if it has one) being Capt. Willard's journey on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue Colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he meets, and he tells the Colonel's story along the way.<br/><br/>My initial feelings towards the film is that it's not particularly gripping at times, especially early on, but at least a good dose of comedy is put in, in the form of surfing fanatic Col. Kilgore. As the film progresses however, a good deal of tension is built up with Willard's reading through various reports on Col. Kurtz until the end is in sight, when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the end.<br/><br/>The usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard. Cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional, and I found the performances of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest to all be worthy of a special mention. The score I found initially sounded out of place, but as the film progressed... I'm not entirely sure if it did actually get better, or it fitted better, or if it had just grown on me, but by the end of the film I was thoroughly enjoying it.<br/><br/>This is the second time I have seen the Redux version, (I have seen the original around four times) I'll say now that the first time I saw it I was disappointed. I was expecting a ""classic"" film, with lots of war. The fact that Willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and didn't carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that IS the film seemed unnecessary. This is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined (as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot), in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully (as with all films that are more character than plot based), as the second time around, you know where the plot is going. I had a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life, which is now one of my favourite films.<br/><br/>With the big four Vietnam films, Apocalypse Now wins over the rest on atmosphere, but lacks the action and involvement of Platoon, the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter, and cannot really be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favourite of the four). Apocalypse Now is a great piece of work, especially towards the end where it becomes staggering, and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesn't mind some casual violence."

","You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer is hackneyed. Or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war (stripped of ""judgement""); that layer is completely uninteresting.<br/><br/>Or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of Duvall's one-liners, but that's just a coating for commercial mastication.<br/><br/>You can try to view this as a 'realistic' Vietnam war film, but ask any veteran and he'll swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinks.<br/><br/>Or view it as a 'will he or won't he' morality play -- nothing rich there, either.<br/><br/>Where I found the value was in the superb self-reference. Coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions (the war) to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing 'a great man'.<br/><br/>Brando the man was as much of a maverick as the Kurtz character. The studios were uncomfortable with his acting 'method', yet he always excelled and won accolades; the 'generals' are uncomfortable with Kurtz's 'unsound methods', in spite of his strategic genius.<br/><br/>So Coppola makes a movie all about Brando's greatness. To hammer on the point, he places himself in the movie (as Hopper, a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras) to spout his praises. Brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by Storaro that only increases the actor's power. And he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. Oh, yes: ""the horror..."" <br/><br/>Other pieces of interest: the great use of point of view camera perspectives, including 'being in the firefight' long before ""Private Ryan""; the ground breaking use of sound, notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip.<br/><br/>Don't get caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-reference."
"jeffreywt","8","2","2","12 January 2006"," what is entertainment?
","Sometimes films are not what I would consider entertainment. Those films I usually avoid. I have watched this film about 5 times in the past few years and my interest in it has grown. To say this film is boring may be going too far, however the idea that you may find some parts seem to drag is understandable. I think watching it a few times gives the same effect as having traveled somewhere several times. That 1 hour commute doesn't seem too long after driving it a few times. If on the first viewing, you find it to be totally boring, then maybe you will not even give it the consideration of a second watch thought I hope you do.<br/><br/>This movie would get 9/10 from me IF Dennis Hopper's character was omitted or at least replaced by more dialog from the green beret character that has zero lines.<br/><br/>In my definition: Entertainment doesn't necessarily require you to become excited or happy. Entertainment is enjoying the passage of your time with minimal effort. This movie allows me to pass time, stimulates my thoughts and emotion, and all I have to do is stare at a screen and eat popcorn."

","Two words: Cutting edge. The film remained quite different from its surroundings at the time. It was the first war film in a long time to receive good acting while many war films were about glory and pure action. It depicted war as a depressing era of death and insanity. While other Nam movies like The Killing Fields (although a great movie) just killed off soldiers, Apocalypse Now made you feel like you lost a member of your family when a soldier died. I felt that the film was to long but with all the information in the film, it couldn't have been shorter. For todays standards people of a younger generation will not appreciate the brilliancy of this film sheerly because from a war film they would expect more violence than dialogue. The Redux version does not compare to the original version and many people will seem impatient as they watch. I suggest eighteen or over not because of the violence, but because it will not appeal to someone younger than that age."
"Andyboy_17","8","2","2","23 August 2005"," A war-movie? Or a movie taking place in the war?
","It has been called ""Simply the best movie ever made!"", while most viewers are just calling it the best war-movie ever made. After watching ""Apocalypse Now! Redux"" twice, I don't think the film earns any of those titles. But Francis Ford Coppola, the man behind one of our time's greatest movie-masterpieces: ""The Godfather"" (1972), has made a film about the Vietnam-war that's a pretty unique movie-experience. This is a must for everyone who like artistic cinema.<br/><br/>Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) is a national hero with a career in the army which is full of merits of bravery and honour. But now he has gone insane, and has escaped from the army and into the jungle of Vietnam, where he is living as a king among an army of his own. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is being given the mission of finding Kurtz and ""terminate"" him. Together with some young unexperienced soldiers, he starts the search. In a boat, through a river, the journey goes deep into the jungle. A slow journey into the insanity and madness of the war...a journey to hell on earth.<br/><br/>Now, can this film really be called a war-movie? The reason I ask this question, is because I feel that this film has its focus on the people in the war, and their experiences and reflections, rather than the war itself. This is not about people fighting in the war, but a story that takes place in Vietnam DURING the war. But this is probably just one of many questions that Coppola wanted people to ask themselves after a weird, thought-provoking, shocking, ""tormenting"" and totally unique film-experience like this.<br/><br/>The most notable thing about ""Apocalypse Now! Redux"", and probably the most impelling part is the cinematography...beautiful and perfect. And over all, I think this film has its definite strength in the visual part, but Coppola's directing and contribution to the score should also be mentioned. It all sets a very special mood for the film, and provides a unique movie-experience that it's hard to not be impressed by. I'm also convinced that this is the most artistic war-movie ever made...it even tops Terrence Mavelick's poetic ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998) when it comes to artistic expressions, in my opinion. So if you like challenging films with depth, I think you should see this film, no matter what you've read or heard about it.<br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now! Redux"" has also a solid cast. Martin Sheen is doing very well in the exacting leading role as Captain Benjamin Willard. Actors such as Dennis Hopper, Frederic Forrest and Marlon Brando is also giving good performances in a film with characters that seems to have a total lack of ""normal"" persons. A young Lawrence Fishburne also shows up and gives a approved performance as Tyrone Miller. But the most memorable performance of the film is being delivered by Robert Duvall. His character Lt. Bill Kilgore is among the most famous in film-history, and the way Duvall portrays him is pure brilliance.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the original ""Apocolypse Now!"" from 1979 with the running time of 2 hours and 30 minutes, but I feel that the running time of 3 hours and 15 minutes is the weakness of ""Apocalypse Now! Redux"". I know long-time admirers of ""Apocalypse Now!"" (1979) has embraced the added scenes in the Redux-version, but I personally found the film a bit long-winded when it approached 3 hours. I think the scenes where Cpt. Willard and his companions visit a French plantation in the middle of the jungle, is the film's lowest point, and there's also some other scenes that lacks consistency, and that's not strengthening the film.<br/><br/>With ""Apocalypse Now! Redux"", Francis Ford Coppola has made a spectacular piece of cinema. Visually, it is perfect and over all this is a film that all film-enthusiasts should experience at least once. But I think the average movie-viewer should go for the original version from 1979. This is a very good film, but not exactly a Top-Rated masterpiece, in my opinion. And if you really want a film about the Vietnam-war, I think Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" (1986) would be a better choice.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10"
"razzbatzz-1","10","2","2","3 August 2005"," The definition of antiwar movie.
","This film is a masterpiece in the history of film-making. This is the film at whom, one of the best filmmakers of the 20'th century, had not made any compromise to external people - not to a producer, not to the US Military and not to the common opinion about Vietnam back in the 70's. Shooting of the footage began in 1976 just one year after the war so you can say this movie is a kind of authentic. Anyway this Film is notorious because of some immortal scenes. There is a lot of discussion about several scenes e.g. the whole ""surfing scene"" or the additional scenes of the redux version. I cannot understand people giving a bad vote because they don't like some scenes - maybe the most of them did not understand the meaning of the scenes they criticize. Anyway the film is a great metaphor it symbolizes the Vietnam War and the single scenes symbolizes the aspects of this conflict. The most conversant scene is the air attack to the village. To use Wagner's music is ingenious - these wonderful music and the senseless Destruction - the ultimate bafflement! These scene symbolizes the nonsense of war. I also liked the scene where the Boat stops at the the Brige to get fuel - it's a kind of surrealistic. I think it symbolize the abuse of drugs - anyway Lace was on drugs. There a lot of scenes that live on the Willard character. Willard is some kind of elite soldier but he is also crude and an alcoholic. The scene where he kills the girl show his coldness. It symbolizes the brutalization of war. Also the whole Kurtz character symbolizes the brutalization. My favorite scene is the end - where Willard arises out of the water, and also the scene where he sit at Kurtz's table and watch to the crowd outside. It symbolizes the dilemma of war."

Robert Duval stands on the beach and talks about how he loves the smell of napalm in the morning. The helicopters are flying low overhead. The music they listen too on the way in. All these things create what is in my mind one of the best scenes in cinematography. Another thing I like about the movie is what a friend told me about an existential journey. My friend told me that you could almost watch the movie from the standpoint that Martin Sheen's journey to kill Colonel Kurtz was never physical but that it was an existential journey in which Sheen is trying to kill the evil that is currently residing in his head. After I watched the movie again from this viewpoint it was fascinating. Now I know that the writer and director(s) didn't mean for this but I still find it interesting."

I believe that this is easily Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, not The Godfather, which is also one of my top ten favorite movies of all time. The writing is spectacular. Every single word of it.

","Bush Administration must be warned immediately about this disturbing development. There is a part of this movie where Captain Willard is reading the dossier on Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. In the confidential dossier there was a story relating how Kurtz's was in trouble with his superiors but when the media heard of Kurtz's heroism his superiors promoted him to full Colonel. Anyway while the voice over was relating this, a newspaper clipping was shown with Kurtz's picture and the title Green Beret Under Fire. Now I know this is a very sad thing to do but I zoomed in on the rest of the article to read it. It is about Iran's nuclear program and the morality of the West's involvement in its development. Apparently they were receiving parts or advice from West Germany. Of course this was when Iran had a pro western regime, which was replaced by the current one. Kind of topical eh? Buy the way there was no mention of a Colonel Walter E. Kurtz or Vietnam. Just thought it was cool but I might just be sad."

"Boba_Fett1138","9","7","12","13 August 2005"," A most unusual masterpiece.
","This movie is extremely odd. Looking at this movie makes it obvious that most of the cast and crew were on drugs during filming. The end movie result, is an unique one of a kind movie experience and quite possible the best Vietnam war movie ever made. It's not a movie for everyone though, guess true movie buffs are the only ones who can truly wholeheartedly appreciate this movie and the 'beauty' of all the ugliness in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie makes a perfect statement as an anti-war movie. It shows the horror of war and what it does to men. I have to admit that my favorite parts of the movie were the ones with action in it. The chopper attack is truly splendid and a real classic moment of movie history. Still this is not really a movie about shooting and fighting. Its more a movie about the emotional struggles of men during war. The struggles of the main character Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) are told in a most excellent, slow, compelling way. He becomes more and more obsessed and interested in the man he is supposed to 'terminate with extreme prejudice', during his journey over the river to Cambodia, where Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), the man he is supposed to kill, is located. Once the movie progresses it becomes obvious that the journey and the emotional struggles seem to be more difficult and dangerous than the killing of Kurtz.<br/><br/>What makes the movie work are the good and realistically brought characters and the actors that portray them. All of the characters are stereotypes in a way, which works extremely well for the movie and its story. Brando is totally flipped in his role as 'crazy' mumbling Colonel Kurtz and even though his role isn't THAT big (ironic sentence, considering the fact that Brando was 40kg overweight, for his role), he still makes a lasting impression. Also totally crazy is Dennis Hopper in his role as American photojournalist that lives under Kurtz. Robert Duvall also gives a most excellent performance as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore. Rest of the cast consists out of big names as Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, G.D. Spradlin and a 14-year old Laurence Fishburne, in one of his first movie roles.<br/><br/>The movie has a fantastic and kind if surreal atmosphere, which makes this movie one of the most moody movies ever made, also thanks to the Oscar winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro.<br/><br/>Perhaps the whole story surrounding the making of this movie (Sheen's heart-attack, the difficult overweight Brando, the drug abuse, the 16 months of filming in the jungle, the three year editing process.) is more legendary than the movie itself, it still is a classic, one of a kind movie, that might very well be the best Vietnam-war movie (yet).<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"rankfilm","10","7","12","20 January 2005"," Apocalypse Now is one of the most disturbing and powerful films of all time
","A stunning masterpiece from the director of the Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola. Apocalypse Now is set during the Vietnam War. It follows the quest of a man called Captain Willard who receives orders to travel up river and locate a renegade officer, the mysterious Colonel Kurtz. Once located Willard is ordered to 'terminate his command with extreme prejudice'. The only problem with this is that as the quest progresses Willard begins to see parts of himself in Kurtz and begins to identify with is intended victim.<br/><br/>With an infamous reputation and a cast to match, I built Apocalypse Now up to be a life changing experience. One thing I can say about it is that it stands out among the bombardment of films that my brain has been subjected to over the years. It had a reputation as being a bit of a let down in Coppola's eyes as he spent far too much money for what the film eventually grossed at the box office. To be fair to Coppola, anything that follows a film as prolific and influential as the Godfather would be hard pushed to surpass its predecessor. I believe that Apocalypse Now does this and at the risk of making myself unpopular with all you film buffs out there I believe that Apocalypse Now is twice the film The Godfather is. It is a film that I attempted to watch numerous times but just couldn't concentrate on it, dare I say it I found it tedious. I just couldn't understand how it had the reputation it does. As a film man I very rarely switch a film off but I did this one, at least the first ten attempts. I then was sitting bored the other night and swore to myself that it was something I just had to do so I sat down, stuck the DVD on and started drinking a large cup of coffee. Two and a half hours later I was mesmerised. Some may say it was the coffee, I say it was the film, but never the less that night I just could not sleep with excitement. Apocalypse Now is one of the most disturbing and powerful films of all time, it reflects the true limits of the human mind and demonstrates ideally how our ideology changes in different situations. A true masterpiece of epic proportions, that if stuck with will make you a truly richer person.<br/><br/>5/5"
"abdulalhazrad","1","18","39","28 June 2004"," the horror was sitting through the redux.
","Francis Coppola made two good movies, and those both had ""Godfather"" in the title. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" was a miserable excuse for a film, and ""Rumble Fish"" was pretty loathsome. I'd rather see either again than another minute of Apocalypse. I realize this is a pretty trendy movie to like, but frankly backlighting Martin Sheen's ear for the last five hours of play was too pretentious for my taste. I realize this review won't change much, but it surprised me to see that nobody had given this so much as the mildest criticism. If you want a good war movie watch Full Metal Jacket, and if you want Joseph Conrad read the damn book. Finally, this is neither a movie about Vietnam, nor is it Vietnam, this is a movie about self gratification and little else."
"Wuchakk","10","6","10","14 March 2014"," The greatest film ever made, but not ""Redux""
","The original ""Apocalypse Now"" is an awe-inspiring masterpiece and is my all-time favorite film. Memorable scenes abound, starting with the mind-blowing opening with Willard (Martin Sheen) having a mental breakdown in his sweltering Saigon hotel room to the tune of The Doors' ""The End.""<br/><br/>Speaking of Sheen, people overlook the fact that he expertly carries the film. His haunting narration is one of the most effective narrations in cinematic history and hooks the viewer into the nightmare-adventure.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the noteworthy scenes, but I'll resist, except to comment on Col. Kurtz: Was he really insane or actually an unrecognized genius? General Corman informs Willard: ""He's out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops."" And, yet, Kurtz was accomplishing what the US military couldn't or wouldn't do because of political complications and niceties. I bring this up because, as I've aged, I've come to see that I'M Col. Kurtz in some ways -- operating ""out there"" beyond the parameters and restrictions typically linked to my work.<br/><br/>The script was written by John Milius with alterations by Coppola as he shot the film whilst the narration was written by Michael Herr. The meaning of the story is obvious: The trip up the river led by Capt. Willard exposes him to two extreme viewpoints of war represented by the two colonels he encounters on his long journey, both of whose names start with 'K,' which is no accident:<br/><br/>COL. KILGORE (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it, i.e. glorifies it. The fact that he's a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning."" War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there's no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he's part of the system and plays the game of war.<br/><br/>COL. KURTZ (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It's horror itself and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can't have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard. The existential Kurtz becomes increasingly disillusioned -- even crazy -- after jumping ship from the system and now has no sanctuary. Death is the only way out. His consolation is that Willard will tell his son the truth.<br/><br/>The ""Redux"" version was put together by Coppola and released in 2001 with the addition of 53 minutes of material that he originally cut. Very little of the added footage improves the film. Most of it simply drags it down; the rest is either boring and unnecessary or adds a dimension of silliness, not to mention being dubiously scripted and acted.<br/><br/>The first let down of ""Redux"" is revealed when Captain Willard hooks up with the boat & crew who are to escort him up the river to find Colonel Kurtz. In the original there's a water-skiing scene on the river which dynamically introduces us to the absurdities of every-day life in the field in Nam (with the Rolling Stone's ""Satisfaction"" blaring). In ""Redux"" this part is cut-and-pasted to an hour LATER in the film, horribly muting the original's introduction to life-in-the-field. (I realize WHY Coppola did this -- because the scene was originally intended to be shown AFTER the boat crew steal Kilgore's surfboard -- but he made the right decision to omit the board-theft scene and place the water-skiing scene near the beginning).<br/><br/>The introduction of Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) in ""Redux"" is good. The charisma of this air cavalry colonel in all his swaggering glory is perfectly showcased in this brief snippet; but the scene's so brief it's unessential.<br/><br/>Four main new sequences definitely DON'T work: The scenes involving the theft of Kilgore's surfboard are silly, badly scripted and unnecessary. In fact, they ruin Kilgore's perfect swan song in the original. Moreover these scenes reveal a goofy side to Willard that mar his grim mystique in the original.<br/><br/>The additional bunny sequence during the rain storm is also silly and unnecessary; it's a huge letdown even if your sole desire is to see some more skin.<br/><br/>The longest added sequence involves the French plantation mentioned in the 1991 documentary ""Hearts of Darkness - A Filmmaker's Apocalypse."" Small bits of this piece work and enrich the film (like the ghostly discovery of the plantation), but on a whole it's too long & talky (where it's impossible to understand the heavily-accented dialogue without subtitles) and simply bogs the film down.<br/><br/>The final added scene that is unnecessary and arguably reduces the potency of the original film is the sequence involving Kurtz reading a couple of underwhelming Time magazine articles to the caged Willard. While it could be argued that this sequence destroys the great mystique of Kurtz since it's the FIRST and ONLY time we get to see him CLEARLY in broad daylight, it could also be argued that it's the key scene showing that Kurtz ISN'T insane at all, just trapped in the remote jungle with no place to go because he ""got off the boat.""<br/><br/>So Coppola made the right decisions with his original 1979 edit of the film. The new footage of ""Redux"" should've simply been relegated to the ""deleted scenes"" section of the DVD. Not every idea that is birthed during the creative process is worthy of the final product and ""Redux"" proves it.<br/><br/>GRADE: Original version: A+ , Redux: C+"
"itamarscomix","9","6","10","1 October 2011"," Wild chaos
","Apocalypse Now is a strange anomaly in the history of cinema. It's a complete disaster of a film, that ran into every catastrophe and hurdle imaginable, and failed on almost every level (just ask Francis Ford Coppola himself). And yet, it's also one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now's wild chaos stands in complete contrast with Coppola's three previous films - The Godfather parts 1 and 2, and The Conversation, all of which were precise, complete and, especially the first one, practically flawless. Apocalypse Now, on the other hand, is filled with flaws; it's messy, inconsistent, at times incoherent, and large parts of it appear (and often are) completely improvised. This is, of course, the one film on which Coppola, having financed most of it himself, had complete creative control. It's the film that brought the age of the auteur to its logical end, and it's also the beginning of the end for that period; one year later the auteur was finally killed by Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate. But while Heaven's Gate is a pompous, pretentious, self-indulgent mess, out of the chaos of Apocalypse Now emerged one of the strongest creations in cinema history.<br/><br/>No description of Apocalypse Now can really capture what it's about; it can be said to be a film about the Vietnam war, or a loose adaptation of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but it's far beyond either one. It's an exploration of the human psyche when it's taken to the most extreme situations of stress and violence - the Vietnam war is used as the setting for that. But, as can be seen in the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"", the production itself qualifies as well. Both Coppola and the cast explored the full range of human emotions on the film, and that's what makes it more powerful and more timeless than war films like Platoon and The Deer Hunter. Apocalypse Now is the human condition. As Coppola himself said - it's not about the Vietnam war, it IS the Vietnam war. Every failing the film had during production only helps create the chaos and distress that make it so unforgettable and such a landmark in cinema history."

What seemed to be evocative intrigue many years ago, seems now to be simply OVERDONE and self-indulgent on the part of a director struggling too hard for immortality through this film.  Sure, the visuals delight the eye with seductive color and convincing composition, but it's the storytelling that falls far short on this new viewing becoming nothing more than a murky ""purple haze"".  I understand the effort to give the film a feel of the drug-induced horror, but, it does so at the expense of everything else.<br/><br/>Some of my favorite films are great heroic epics, such as The English Patient, Lawrence of Arabia, Saving Private Ryan, Deer Hunter,  even Gladiator, but Apocalypse Now, despite some excellent scenes (Duvall's character on the beach; the killing of the boat family; the death by arrow of the boat's ""Chief""), seems on the whole to fall terribly short of masterpiece material.  The ending was completely disgusting to me, when the slaughter of the carribou parallels the killing of Kurtz.  Then to read in the credits or somewhere else on the DVD that they did actually slaughter a carribou ritually for this film, just put me over the edge as far as this film is concerned.  It's one thing to suggest violence in a film, but to actually use it in a film is just outrageous. I'll never waste my time on this film again!"

Another short scene where Willard is captive in a shipping container is missing.<br/><br/>In this new version, the film is more visually cohesive and the mood gradually builds with less of the distractions of before. With a 4K rendition, shots are more obviously out of focus on rare occasion. Coppola has made a legendary film as near to cinematic perfection as one could imagine, especially considering it was shot on film, with no digital trickery to fall back on."

The musical score sets the scene perfectly.<br/><br/>The script is brilliant. Some of the writing is the best I've ever seen in a film, the voice-over narration particularly. Those iconic opening words - ""Sh-t. Saigon."" - really stay with you, not like I've ever really experienced before.<br/><br/>But the main point of brilliance is that fantastic scene where the napalm strike is called onto the beach. Not once with a film have I felt so excited and entertained, the whole sequence was heart-stopping. That alone was enough to give the whole film a ten-out-of-ten.<br/><br/>But the excitement didn't stop there. As the story progresses, as we see more, more interest develops. The scenes with the calendar models and the soldiers meeting are compelling, giving us more of an insight of the characters. It's really more than JUST a war film.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that Marlon Brando's performance was simply superb, as with all of his performances. But there isn't a single bad actor in the whole film. Every famous face never faults.<br/><br/>Of course, the film's epic length may be strenuous for some viewers, and less patient viewers may find it tedious, but for me and many others it's a sure classic.<br/><br/>Overall: 9.7/10"
"EamesTheForger","10","5","8","8 October 2011"," Excellent Vietnam War film
","The film's opening scene alone is worth the price of the DVD - the haunting image of helicopters flying low over a jungle that is suddenly engulfed by an explosion of napalm is not easily forgotten, but Coppola's real genius lies in the the overlaying of a soundtrack that immediately evokes the time and place of these events - The Door's The End (surely the epitome of 60's psychedelia) providing a drugged-up anaesthetic to the violence of the images on the screen.<br/><br/>Based on Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now follows an American soldier travelling upriver into the depths of a Vietnamese tribal culture which seems to become more and more savage. Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on a confidential mission by the US army to eliminate Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz, once one of the finest officers the army had seen, has apparently lost all sense of reality and has gathered his own private Vietnamese army deep in the jungle.<br/><br/>Early in Willard's mission we witness one of film's most powerful scenes; an attack by US helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village. We see the simple way of life in the village as the helicopters appear on the horizon, with their on-board loudspeakers blasting out Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. Robert Duvall's psychopathic US officer gives remorseless orders to gun down the women and blow up the bridges. This scene is starkly real yet magnificent to watch, and leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. Few films have portrayed the chaos and randomness of war so clearly or so shockingly.<br/><br/>As Willard progresses further up the river the film becomes more and more surreal and foreboding, and we begin to realise that Kurtz has experienced something which has led to his 'madness'. This all becomes apparent in the philosophical, spaced-out ending in which Willard finally finds Kurtz's jungle sanctuary.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now should not be seen as an overview of the Vietnam War; it is instead a film about one man's journey into darkness, and about the people he meets and the events he witnesses on the way. There are no heroes in this film – just ordinary (and not so ordinary) people trying to survive the best way they can. It recognises that each soldier is different and that each has a story: one young soldier is shown dying while a letter from his mother is read aloud, another soldier screams hysterically as he forced to get off a helicopter and go into war, while Robert Duvall's character famously describes his love of 'the smell of napalm in the morning'. While the viewer is left in no doubt as to the horrors of war, Coppola does not set out to create a sentimental account of 'war being hell'.<br/><br/>While immersed in the breathtaking sound and visuals I have to pinch myself to remember that this film was made in the 70s. It is still as technically spectacular as any film I have ever seen. Ignore the hype surrounding the gimmick of 3D; the realness of the visuals in Apocalypse Now has a far stronger effect. The film is one of the most important and pioneering in history; without it the modern war film would be very different.<br/><br/>It seems a pity that every film more than a few months old is confined to the small screen. Is cinema not the ultimate way to view a film? Imagine only being able to read books or listen to songs released in 2011. There are dozens of forgotten films screaming out for a re-release, from Once Upon a Time in the West to Blade Runner. The magic of acting legends and veteran directors should be seen the way it was meant to be seen. Do not miss the re-release of Apocalypse Now for the world."

","I agree with Ann Medina from the Canadian History channel when she says 'it's not a story, it's an experience'. In my opinion, using the Vietnam war is just a convenient medium to actualize concepts about living everyday life, since our lifestyles can be rife with conflict as well.<br/><br/>Others have argued the opposite; that the movie is too extreme, too evil; that it's trying to imply that we must keep depravity close at hand to keep things real and define our lives. I, however, see the movie as a balancing act between religion and inhibitions with individuality, courage, and convictions. Otherwise known as the eternal struggle of man. Concepts of evil are to some degree, culturally based; to kill a cow in India is considered a crime, while in the western world, we eat hamburgers quite regularly. We have already accepted several things in our lives that others would consider sick and depraved. Just ask PETA. Just ask Ret'd UN Commander Romeo Dallaire. But I digress at this point.<br/><br/>William Golding's book titled 'The Lord of The Flies' stipulates that evil is simply a nervous and irrational reflex to our fear of the Unknown, in whatever guise that may truly be. For instance, I'm afraid to be thin, because I might be afraid that my excuse for not being sexually appealing will disappear with the extra ugly flab. It could be that I'm just not sexy. *G*<br/><br/>Walter Kurtz, as played by Marlon Brando, got a glimpse of that knee-jerk hysterical evil after witnessing the slaughter of innocents; arms that were injected with a polio vaccine had been hacked off. His mistake was in growing to admire the finality of such an action when in fact, it was a chronic lack of understanding of modern medico logy compounded by a preternatural paranoia of a better developed force. But, Walter Kurtz, in turn, had misunderstood the origins of such evil and reacted blindly to it by losing his mind. He merely proves again that reactions from too little knowledge are dangerous and that again, evil has been begotten by past evils. And Benjamin Willard (aka Martin Sheen) perpetuates the downward spiral of human society by executing his own order of justice. But he was afforded the luxury however grotesque, of not having to think overmuch about his task, he merely had to make sure it got done. So who is right or ultimately wrong?<br/><br/>Evil exists on various levels. A concept of evil is governed by early childhood experiences, educational, and parental support systems. Evil defined at the most fundamental level is when an entity causes or compels a deeply changed state upon another entity. One type of evil is when genocide is deemed acceptable because people have been deeply compelled to believe that some other types of people are not entirely sentient. Obviously, this is a circular type of evil that perpetuates over many generations. If you have been led to believe that an entity does not enjoy your supposedly higher level of sentience, you will not know that you have committed evil against the entity.<br/><br/>A fundamental definition such as this may not be realistically applied since we usually define evil subjectively. For example, an entity is not necessarily committing evil when an entity causes another entity to exist or be born. So should the definition be altered or are we already subjectively moving the definition to our own preference? Is evil an entity causing or compelling a permanently changed state upon another entity rather than an extreme temporary change? We are then saying that drastic changes upon an entity are not evil when they are only finite. The birth of a entity is not evil because the life of the entity is never permanent, the child is never immortal. <br/><br/>Murder, rape, and physical or emotional abuse are still evil under this revised definition but for two of those instances it has to be acknowledged, known, or believed that entities can possess souls that live forever beyond physical death. But it also has to be true that the birth of an entity does not mean that the soul is beginning its own existence too. If a soul were not to be evil, the body could only be the temporary host for a soul that had already existed for all of infinity; an entity that had no beginning or no end of being alive. And, in another thought, if heaven was created--which is supposed to last forever--did God Himself commit evil...or did heaven also always existed with an undefined beginning or end? <br/><br/>We could do a third improvisation and exclude 'entities' from the definition and instead cite 'organisms' to subjectively skirt Godly issues. We now say that evil is when organisms cause or compel a permanent change upon another organism. What about books like 'Mein Kampf' which sometimes causes a person to permanently alter his or her way of thinking to become anti-government and anti-semitic? Or do we claim that it was the the fault of the reader since the alteration does not occur for everybody? What if written words such as these in this ditsy review of a movie permanently alters one's opinion of evil? D'oh. <br/><br/>The definition of what constitutes an organism could be too subjective, inconstant, or contextual. It might be proved one day that man-made electricity is evil. The bumping of electrons from molecule to molecule might be permanently disrupting thousands of unseen galaxies containing countless sentient beings too small for human technology to readily perceive for empirical proof of their existence. But don't let that permanently compel you to turn off your computer, just run away screaming; that's a temporary state."

","Apocalypse now is Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece, set in the ultimate heart of darkness: Vietnam. What makes Apocalypse now so great and different from other war films, is that it's not really a war film since his focus is more on the sanity of mankind and the darkness in our minds, in other words our human emotions when we are surrounded by so much destruction in the war. it's amazing how one film can capture the many emotions of great and interesting characters all in two hours and 20 min. the story is when Capt. Willard receives a classified mission to terminate Col. Kurtz, he must run a patrol boat down one of the rivers of Vietnam to to terminate all illegal missions that Col. Kurtz has assigned. Along the way, he doubts whether or not his sanity, let alone Col. Kurtz's, is secure in the setting of the Vietnam War. the film is the adoption of Joseph Conrad's famous book ""the heart of darkness."" His novel adaption is translated into the setting of the Vietnam War, which is a clever idea by itself. Also, we have so many characters that are interesting and want to know more about. My personal favorite character from the film is Kilgore, because he is not stereotypical as a general and has so many interesting qualities to him which makes you want to learn more and more about him. All the other characters are great too! Martin Sheen as Capt. Willard was the most emotional and psychological of the characters in the movie which really makes us interested in the storyline as well. He tells the story through mostly narration, probably looking back on his experiences in the Vietnam War. Marlon Brando an exceptional job as Col. Kurtz, because he made him seem so evil and totally insane at the same time. there are also very many other aspects of the film that makes it so great, the cinematography is incredible, the dialogue is clever, and the adventures are irresistible. Since I don't want any spoilers in this review, I will not tell you the ending, but I will say that the ending of Apocalypse now is one of the greatest endings in film history, and when you see the ending you'll realize how powerful and emotional the ending really is.<br/><br/>Overall, Apocalypse now is one of the greatest films ever made, deathly worth the watch. And by the way, the doors song ""The End"" is used absolutely perfectly the movie.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 stars, or five out of five stars"

","Apocalypse Now is a war film set during the Vietnam War.The central character is US Army special operations officer Captain Benjamin L. Willard,played by Martin Sheen,of MACV-SOG, an assassin sent to kill the renegade and presumed insane Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz,portrayed excellently by acting genius,Marlon Brando.Apart from the two actors,it also features Robert Duvall,Laurence Fishburne,Dennis Hopper,Harrison Ford,Frederic Forrest,Sam Bottoms and Albert Hall.The movie was co-written together with John Milius,produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now adapts the Joseph Conrad novella Heart of Darkness to depict the war as a descent into primal madness. Capt. Willard,already on the edge,is assigned to find and deal with AWOL Col. Kurtz,who rumored to have set himself up in the Cambodian jungle as a local, lethal godhead. Along the way Willard encounters different personalities such as napalm and Wagner fan Col. Kilgore, draftees who prefer to surf and do drugs, a USO Playboy Bunny show turned into a riot by the raucous soldiers, and a jumpy photographer telling wild, reverent tales about Kurtz. By the time Willard sees the heads mounted on stakes near Kurtz's compound, he knows Kurtz has gone over the deep end, but it is uncertain whether Willard himself now agrees with Kurtz's insane dictum to ""Drop the Bomb. Exterminate them all.""<br/><br/>This film is the greatest Vietnam War film ever made especially when it presented the concept that war is hell and madness.Also,it only tells the viewer that nobody is right and only dead bodies are the ones left.Aside from dead bodies,it also portrays how men are physically and psychologically decapitated by it.Apart from the theme and the message presented,the film also has a great cast that delivers a powerful performance and it rises to the occasion of elevating the movie to one of the best films ever made.Marlon Brando as usual delivers in his role that as always proves that he is the best actor that ever lived in the world.While Martin Sheen proves credible as the lead protagonist.The actors involved makes it compelling that it shocks the audience to the fullest about the realism brought about by destruction of war and Coppola's direction does that through audio and visual means.And most of all,this is a must-see film not for everyone to fully realize that nothing good is brought about by war.In summary,Apocalypse Now is truly a masterpiece."
"rmax304823","8","3","4","8 February 2009"," The heads -- you're lookin' at the heads....
","What a movie. Martin Sheen is an anguished Army captain in Vietnam in 1968, ordered to proceed up river to the Cambodian border on a Navy River Patrol Boat and assassinate a Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has apparently gone berserk and established his own little, ruthless anti-communist empire in the jungle.<br/><br/>It's a free transposition of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" but that hardly matters. Nor does the overall plot. We already know most of it because some of its features have become integral to our vernacular culture. ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like -- victory."" ""The horror. The horror."" (Well -- that last is lifted directly from Conrad's novel, but never mind.) <br/><br/>What Stephen Spielberg did so miraculously with light in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" Francis Ford Coppola does with smoke here. All kinds of smoke. Gray smoke from gunfire and explosions. Amber smoke from fires. Pink and lime and lavender smoke from flares and grenades. People stalk slowly through it like images from hell. Boats drift through clouds of it.<br/><br/>The lighting (Vittorio Storaro) and special effects contribute to the impact of the film too. Brando's first appearance in unforgettable chiaroscuro. A burnt orange light illuminates his shaved head from the side and turns the naked scalp into a luminous crescent. Then Brando bows his head, dips his fingers into a bowl of water and flutters his fingertips along the skin as if playing a piano or celesta.<br/><br/>Sheen's boat and its two-man crew glide very slowly into the tiny cove which serves as Brando's main port. The place looks like mannequin factory. There are bodies and body parts strewn about. Bodies that are more or less whole droop from the trees and from the gargoyle monuments that surround the entrance to Brando's dark and beckoning castle. Hundreds of half-naked natives with spears and guns have assembled in silence to greet the boat. Out of this unholy horde dances a crazed photographic journalist, the ever reliably crazed Dennis Hopper. He shouts greetings, shakes hands, welcomes them warmly, but adds in a wary tone, ""They think you've come to kill him -- and I hope THAT'S not true."" He leads the stunned Sheen through the throng that opens before them. Sheen is gaping at some of the body parts. ""The heads -- you're lookin' at the heads! Y'know, sometimes he goes too far, but he'll be the first to admit it, man."" <br/><br/>Brando is a warrior and a poet. Near the end, one scene seems to be a T. S. Eliot study group gone awfully wrong. He's a philosopher. ""Did you ever think that the middle word of LIFE is IF?"" That whole climactic visit to Brando's fortress in the wilderness lifts the movie out of whatever sense of reality it had earlier carried and places it squarely into the surreal. It's just impossible. A viewer can't tell what consequences any given event will precipitate. There are two beheadings and a buffalo having its head half chopped off by the Bontoc Igorots among whom this film was shot. (Only three generations ago, they hunted heads. I was in graduate school with an Igorot whose grandfather had enjoyed such an enterprise.) <br/><br/>It's about as arty a film as you're likely to see, if art means slowly and relentlessly digging beneath the civilized surface of human culture and uncovering the uncoverable nature of humanity itself, and that's not a pretty picture."
"thinker1691","8","3","4","27 January 2009"," "" You Need to assassinate this man as he is winning a war, we promised we wouldn't win ""
","Americans have always won wars which involved great patriotism. World War I and II were global and fought in conjunction with our allies and were eventually brought to successful conclusions. After that, American wars were not successful as the goals and their ultimate purposes were hazy at best. The Viet-Nam war was a case in point. As the film ""Apocalypse Now"" tells it, a 'special opts' soldier, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is selected to travel up-country in Viet-Nam to assassinate or as they put it, 'terminate' the command of Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he is doing something which the pentagon officials have promised the politicians they would not do. This determined American individual is winning the war and doing it with such field tactics and savage methods which in their mind boarder on the criminal. Williard is torn between admiration for his target and conviction for his mission. Along the way, the Captain sees just how insane the Viet-Nam war really is. One commander he meets Lt. Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall) borders on sheer lunacy with statements such as "" I love the smell of Napalm in the morning."" Another individual he meets is a photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) so impressed with Kurtz' ability to win the war, believes him to be not only mystical, but divine. The story is loosely based on Joseph Conrad's book 'Heart of Darkness' where the hero is sent not to kill him, but to save him. However in this adaptation Willard the assassin, who mimicking robot-like soldiers will follow orders regardless how insane those orders are. The great cast includes Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford and Scott Glenn as Lieutenant Colby make this film one of the truly memorable pictures of our time. Winning so many awards, its difficult to tell which aspect of the movie helped make this story a Classic. ****"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","3","4","11 October 2006"," Oi, e, va! That was one heck of a movie to get through!
","I really didn't think it was possible to get through Apocalypse Now, over three and a half hours! Well, unfortunately, my sister gave me the Director's Cut to watch, so it was a bit of an ambush of a film. But still, now that I can take a breath, I can honestly say that was one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. Definitely one of a kind, to be honest, I didn't realize also that Marlon Brando really only has a cameo in the film, but it was so memorable that I can see why he is praised when it comes to this movie.<br/><br/>It's about a captain played by Sheen, he is sent to Vietnam to capture and kill Captain William played by Brando. William has made himself into a God of a Vietnam tribe and you can tell by his appearance, he's been through Hell. But that's exactly what Sheen has also been through just trying to get to William, through the bloody jungles of Vietnam, he has seen the most horrific images and watch his friends/troop get killed off one by one.<br/><br/>Truly an epic motion picture, I can see why this movie is praised. It's so incredibly haunting and disturbing, the soundtrack really does add so much. The sets are incredible but very scary to look at. Sheen and Brando are just amazing in this film, but it's great to see the ""new"" faces of the time, including Harrison Ford and Lawerence Fishbourne, not to mention we have Dennis Hopper and one of the most amazing directors of our time, Francis Ford Coppola.<br/><br/>Although, I'm not sure if I could make it through this movie again, for the simple sake of my sanity, I really can't see how this movie could be anyone's favorite to be honest. It's so friggin' depressing! But I will never ever ever doubt what an incredibly moving and disturbing picture it was to watch. I'm going to have nightmares these next few nights! <br/><br/>8/10"

"brucecoughran","10","3","4","29 August 2001"," See the ""Redux"" version!
","The re-cut version of this famous film (""Apocolypse Now: Redux"", 2001) takes this classic to a new level.  Ten years removed from the near-mythic stories about the film itself and the making of it, as well as from the actual events of Viet Nam (which it is not about, by the way), serves this film enormously. It allows the film itself more room to stand on its own somehow.<br/><br/>
But more importantly, the added footage (which is quite significant, 49 min. I think) makes the film a much more profound and more eloquent piece of cinema.  The emotional life is filled out, the journey itself is more understandable, and the theme of the film more powerfully explicit than in the original release (which followed the ""action"" more closely).  See this film if for no other reason than to see how small the aspirations of current filmmakers seem to have become."

"NeanderthalDNA","10","4","6","15 February 2017"," The Horror. . . The Horror. . .
","During the Vietnam War, the young American Captain Willard is given the assignment to hunt down and kill one of his own: Colonel Kurtz, who has apparently gone insane, murdered hundreds of innocent people and constructed a strange kingdom for himself deep in the jungle. Willard and his crew embark on a surreal river journey to find Kurtz, meeting along the way a Lieutenant-Colonel who surfs during live combat, Playboy bunnies dropped in by helicopter to entertain rowdy troops, and the inhabitants of a French plantation trapped in colonial times.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is not a Vietnam War film. Do not confuse it with one. It is set to the back drop of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. It is also one of the most audacious films ever made, produced, or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film's production levels. Opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the Doors ""The End"" as Martin Sheen's Captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes. Willard's mission is to ""terminate... with extreme prejudice"" Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has invariably gone AWOL in the far reaches of the Cambodian jungle and, as told by his general, is ""out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops."" Kurtz is a delusional Colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god. For Willard, this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat, yet, the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior. Teaming up with a small crew, they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz. During Sheen's raspy voice over, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. He was a normal man with a family, until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that Willard is being led. The descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away. Eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses. But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythic figure, he is drawn to the man's power and why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard's slow decay will parallel that of Kurtz's. Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: unmatchable. His genius: undeniable. But for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance, Brando can be perceived, in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer, as a hack. He is most certainly not. Brando was difficult to work with, hard to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn't. His Colonel Kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity. If the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than Francis Ford Coppola's actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man's fanatical struggle to produce a movie. It is reported that during the film's 200 plus day principle photography schedule, Coppola contemplated suicide. The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; it is a grueling film to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of Martin Sheen's haunted soldier Willard. I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film. At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented, films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is pure film-making. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest order. But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today's standards for film: a lack of innovation. It is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today; it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart. But we still have the great ones like Coppola's masterpiece, a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend. That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step into madness. The killing can disturb. The loss of innocence can unhinge. But it is the damage from within; the countless barrages of images that distress, unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual, the savage and the animalistic. If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance, the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis."

","I've watched Apocalypse Now multiple times since I first saw it, and it gets better and better each time. Every time I take something new from it. It is a masterpiece, certainly the greatest war film ever made and certainly one of the greatest films ever made regardless of genre. Apocalypse Now shows the human condition pushed to the limit in times of war, excellently adapting the classic novel ""Heart Of Darkness"" and giving it a new setting of the Vietnam War as a way of showing the slippery slope into darkness and insanity that could happen to any of us.<br/><br/>The film pushes the limits when it comes to showing just how insane everyone was in Vietnam, reflected not only in Robert Duvall's insane Colonel Bill Kilgore and Marlon Brando's deliciously insane and poetic Colonel Kurtz but in the journey undertaken by Captain Willard and his men across the river, which geniusly represents their slide into insanity and doom the closer they get to their goal.<br/><br/>Heart Of Darkness was the perfect novel for Coppola to adapt in order to show the horrors of Vietnam, as everything from Kurtz' attitude to the war and the hypocrisy of leaders and the true horrors of war itself are perfectly reflected with the Vietnam war, a war which Coppola felt was ""Heart Of Darkness coming true"" The film has one classic sequence after another to add to its legacy: The opening montage set to ""This Is The End"" by The Doors, The exhilarating and shocking ""Ride Of The Valkyries"" Helicopter attack, Kilgore's iconic, passionate and disturbing speech about how he sees the war, the mind-numbingly depressing riverboat sequence, ""Do you know who is in charge here?"", the deaths of each of the major characters the further they go, the arrival at the camp, the thought provoking conversations between Willard and Kurtz, ""The Horror....The Horror"" and of course the haunting final shots before everything fades to black.<br/><br/>We all know the hell Coppola himself went through in getting this film made through a protracted and stressful production littered with problems from drug use to Marlon Brando's attitude to the problems with the military equipment they'd rented, but it was all worth it in the end.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is more than just a great war movie that shows the horrors of war. It is also a movie that exposes the true depths of the darkness that lays inside all of us.<br/><br/>One of the greatest films ever made."
"Cameronius_113","9","4","6","15 January 2017"," What an amazing film
","Apocalypse Now was released in 1979 and was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The movie is about a Vietnam War soldier named Captain Willard who is assigned with the task of hunting down one of the best known officers, Colonel Kurtz who has been presumed to have gone insane. This movie takes a metaphorical look at the war instead of just plainly displaying everything on screen which makes for a more interesting experience as it has many more layers and much more depth to it than what appears on the surface (much like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). There are numerous scenes with stand-out metaphors, some of which are even acknowledged directly by the film itself, for example the scene at the beginning with the fan seeming to represent the rotors on the helicopter, and these thing help build up what this film is. Lighting is also commonly used as a metaphor which was interesting. Every member of the cast gave a brilliant performance; Martin Sheen was great as the lead character Captain Willard and his character and his mind was given lots of depth, as from my viewpoint all of the metaphors are created inside Willard's mind. While his appearance was brief, Robert Duvall was great as Lieutenant Kilgore and showed a character who had experience but was strangely enjoying war unlike most which made for a unique character. Marlon Brando gave an amazing, eerie performance as Colonel Kurtz and his character was very well-written; you could see where he was coming from and what his motivations were and also the look into his fractured mind was haunting. Also, the supporting characters on Willard's boat were also great and you could connect with each one individually and they all felt like real people. They also had great chemistry too. Another thing that I believe adds to the film in a way is that it was as much of an apocalypse on set as it was in the actual film; Martin Sheen suffered from drinking issues and had a heart attack which delayed production, Marlon Brando didn't arrive to production the way the director wanted him to, multiple sets were destroyed before they got used and also Coppola struggled to find a satisfying ending. The production was massively delayed from weeks to over a year and Coppola reportedly threatened suicide multiple times due to the stress and how he thought the movie would turn out terrible and would end his career. Most of the time, a troubled production can have major effects on the final product (Alien 3 for example, however the Assembly Cut does significantly improve it), however all of these real issues contributed in a positive way to the film in my opinion; there's a scene where Willard is suffering from post-traumatic stress and goes mental in his hotel room and during the scene Martin Sheen was genuinely suffering from effects of his alcohol troubles and I feel if these issues in real life didn't happen then the film would be quite different to what it turned out to be. I find this film interesting because of, like I mentioned earlier, instead of it just showing war how it appeared on the surface, it goes much deeper and shows the way it is depicted in the human mind; the entire film is told from the perspective of the human mind (seeing as the entire film is a flashback) and would be viewed as the impact the events had on the mind instead. I believe that this is the most effective way of showing how damaging war was because it shows the events from the inside instead of the outside which makes them more understandable and it really did prove to me exactly what war can do to someone psychologically. Overall, this was an amazing, psychological war film which is much more than what it appears, with amazing performances from the cast and also many haunting but effective themes. I would highly recommend this film. 8.8/10"

"masterjim2010","10","4","6","8 February 2010"," I compared the Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now
","Inside every human soul lies a savage evilness that remains most invisible in the normal world. This dark side of human soul, like a monster imprisoned in a cage, a devil hidden from the daylight, lurks deeply, quietly in man's mind and seems would never show itself out. But somehow, this evil side will break out during times of isolation from our culture. Whenever one culture confronts another, whenever different cultures encounter, there is often a fear of corruption and loss of self that leads us to discover more about our true selves, causing madness by those who have yet to discover. Joseph Conrad's book, Heart of Darkness and the movie, Apocalypse Now are both stories about man's journey into his self, and the discoveries to be made there. They are also about Man confronting his fears of failure, insanity, and death.<br/><br/>In Heart of Darkness, during Marlow's mission to find Kurtz, he is also trying to find himself. He, like Kurtz, had good intentions of entering the Congo. Joseph Conrad tries to show us that Marlow is what Kurtz had been and Kurtz is what Marlow could become. Every human has a little of Marlow and Kurtz in them. Along the trip into the wilderness, they discover their true selves through contact with barbaric natives. As Marlow ventures further up the Congo, he feels like he is traveling back through time. He sees the unsettled wilderness and can feel the darkness of its solitude. The deeper into the jungle he goes, the more awkward the inhabitants seem. Kurtz had lived in the Congo, and was separated from his own culture for quite some time. He had once been considered an honorable man, but the jungle changed him greatly. Here in Congo, set apart from his own society, he discovered his evil side and became corrupted by his power and solitude. Marlow tells us about the Ivory that Kurtz kept as his own, and that he had no restraint. Kurtz went insane and allowed himself to be worshiped as a god. It appears that while Kurtz had been isolated from his culture, he had become assimilated into this violent native culture, and allowed his evil side to control him. Marlow realizes that only very near the time of death does a person grasp the true nature of human. Kurtz's last supreme moment showed him how horrible the human soul really can be. Marlow can only guess that what Kurtz saw that caused him to exclaim ""The horror!"" Marlow guesses that Kurtz suddenly knew everything and discovered how horrible the way of man can be. Marlow learned from Kurtz's death and he now knows that inside every human there always exists this horrible, evil side. <br/><br/>The movie, Apocalypse Now, directed by Francis Ford Coppola in 1979, is basically adapted from Joseph Conrad's book. The similar story goes that Captain Willard is a Marlow who is on a mission into Cambodia during the Vietnam War to find and kill an insane Colonel Kurtz. Kurtz was an outstanding officer and once a respected, successful, brilliant leader. Like Joseph Conrad's Kurtz, this Kurtz shows us a man who was once highly esteemed, but then corrupted by the horror of war and the cultures he met. In Heart of Darkness we find that Kurtz's major fear is being white in a non-white jungle. In Apocalypse Now, Colonel Kurtz tells Willard that the Special Forces went into a village, checking the children for polio and going away, and the communists then came into the village and cutting off all the children's arms. This shocking experience could be the main evidence for the cause of Colonel Kurtz's madness. This could be the beginning of Kurtz's falling into the darkness. He found himself facing a new culture and has a terrible time dealing with it. This tells us that the evil side and the madness in both two Kurtz were brought out by the fear of new cultures different from their own, and their inability to cope with this fear. They found their original moralities; faiths, ideals were so fragile, so easily collapsed before new cultures. And at last they both crushed down by this fear and governed by it. <br/><br/>Moreover, in the film, through Willard's journey, we see American culture always views itself as correct, and Americans regard themselves as powerful police of the world. Their culture looked down upon the Vietnamese because Vietnamese were simpler, just as Europe and Marlow looked down on the Africans. Believing themselves to be superior, Americans had many difficulties in handling the fact that they are actually not that superior. Apocalypse Now makes a point to show us that the chief of a boat armed to the teeth was killed by a native who just threw a spear, which also happened in Marlow's journey. This opens Captain Willard's eyes to the horror he now finds himself in. Both the Conrad's novel and Coppola's film reveal that we live sheltered in our own society, and our exposure to other cultures is limited. Often, the more technologically advanced cultures look down upon those which they deem to be simpler. On the occasion that some member of one culture does come into contact with another, simpler culture, a self discovery happens. Ultimately, both cultures realize that deep down inside, all humans are essentially the same. We all possess a heart of goodness and a heart of darkness. This is truly an undeniable fact. The self discovery often causes madness, insanity as the evil side is unleashed. Only those who have completed the journey into self can understand the actions of people such as two Kurtz. ""The horror!!"" they screamed when the death finally seized them. The scream was miserable, sorrowful, desperate, and was from their heart of darkness. No one could understand them because they are alone in the world of horror."

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","9","4","6","2 September 2004"," Hard to sit through and not terribly good ending
","The only two problems with this movie are, as the one line summary states, the length and the ending. It's so long that unless you're very determined or very patient, you're not gonna sit through it to the end(particularly not if you're watching the ""redux"" version which I was(un?)lucky enough to see on TV). And the ending seems to suggest that Coppola had either run out of steam or simply didn't know how he should end it. As a war film, it's not particularly realistic, I guess, but more of a piece about the descent into madness that you experience under such dehumanizing circumstances. I found it interesting to see as such a film, but arguably not much else... I also found it interesting to recognize the actors, whom I, for the most part, hadn't seen in a film from, at least before the 80's. If any of this doesn't make sense, don't blame me... blame the fact that I'm writing this as I'm almost falling asleep after the movie. Now, let it be known, that I didn't pay attention to the entire thing; I am neither a man of great patience nor determination(well, not enough, anyway) so I fell asleep once or twice through this film, and actually found myself awaking a few minutes after it had ended, and had to rewind it to catch the ending. Maybe that affected my judgment, maybe not(it probably did). However, what I saw, I mostly liked. The acting is very good. The characters are well-written and nuanced. The action is well-done. The cinematography is very good. All in all, a very good film, if you have the patience and you're sufficiently interested in seeing this very well done piece of film, despite it's very long runtime(maybe you would want to start with the original version, not the ""redux"" one I saw). I recommend it to just about anyone who really is interested in films and the media of movies. If you can sit through it, you probably should. Any Coppola fan should definitely experience this. 9/10"

I can understand all the hype about this film back in the day way before CGI came along – the logistics and the scale of the film set were all real. But that's all I could possibly like about it. It was too long and wasn't engaging enough to keep me awake. This couldn't possibly get any nominations by today's standards. I was struggling to stay awake only because my good friend who highly recommended it was watching with me. Otherwise, I would have stopped watching and gone to bed half-way through the movie. I was lost every time a long scene came along with lengthy, boring dialogues. Overrated, bad-acting, tried-to-be-arty snooze-fest, I reckon."

","Anyone who thinks this is what the Vietnam war was like obviously was not there. Coppola made millions, and received awards, using the civilian's anti-military attitude of the time. It paints the service members as insane bloodthirsty and drug addled. Yes, some of us stupidly used alcohol and/or drugs to escape the hell. Yes there was a few who did go off. But this this makes it appear the majority of us were. Some still believe most service members are crazed madmen. Wonder where they got that idea? God forgive Coppola for this one. He's a very influential and progressive director but, he's piled more dung on the fire with this one. He rates right up there with Hanoi Jane IMHO. You want a good realistic Vietnam war movie?

"MiloMindbender","10","6","11","25 December 2003"," The last great Hollywood film
","**Spoilers**<br/><br/>I first saw AN on TV while I was in high school.  Then, I found it interesting and compelling,but the obtuse plot confused me and prompted me to venture into the kitchen for snacks a few times & I fell asleep before it ended. Although greater maturity may have given me new perspective, the added scenes are pivotal to the movie's themes & are crucial to understanding the film. Now, seeing this re-edited version on the big screen some 15 or so years later I realize what a masterpiece it is.  Back then, I watched it to gain an understanding of Vietnam/war. Now, Armed with more knowledge of US (military) history (but not having read anything about the making of AN or ""The Heart of Darkness"", the book on which it was based), I realize that the movie wasn't really about Vietnam....or war, for that matter. The Vietnam War is really just the background/setting for the movie. ""War is hell"" is a rather cliche plot for war movies (and not really much of a plot in & of itself). AN avoids the cliche because it is really a study in human behaviour & social organization under duress.  The film reveals how ritual makes or breaks individuals under duress.  Take the early scene with the helicopters lifting off.  Chef asks one soldier why he sits on his helmet, to which the soldier replies ""to protect my balls"".  When Chef takes off his helmet & sits on it too, we see how ritual is born of superstition. Sitting on his helmet may not make him any safer, but the feeling of control over the situation helps them to survive (ease his nervousness & focus his attention on the matter at hand) while under attack. On first viewing, I had also assumed that Willard was the central character of the story.  But he's not, he's the narrator & his fate is sealed in order to tell the ""story"" to its end.  So not only is his cool, detached demeanor essential to his survival, it's also a literary device that's essential for the telling of the story. As a result, his behaviour is the least interesting of all the characters in the movie.  He's a ""special forces"" man because he does what he's told & performs his duty to its end. Hence, his character does not develop in the film. *Spoilers* By contrast, the most interesting characters to watch are Lance & Chef. Only one of the two survives to the very end, and the reason why lies in the ability of his character to adapt to his environs.  This is why the addition of the scenes contrasting the two of them with the Playboy bunnies really helps to make more sense of the subject matter.  These scenes, which were not in the original, are the pivotal moment at which the characters' raison d'etre is put to the tests (& ironically it's not in war that this occurs). Chef takes the opportunity to play out the same fantasy he had before he came to Vietnam, having sex with Miss March.  Lance, on the other hand, becomes more playful in the scene, plays with the bunny's make-up & in the process creates his own new ritual.  Chef's inability to consumate a sexual relation with the Playboy bunny is unsatisfying/empty because he can't accomplish his goal given the circumstances.  Lance, on the other hand, isn't remotely concerned with conquest & instead has entered a new world/frame of mind. From this point on, Lance cultivates this ritual (the scene with him applying camouflage while looking into the bunny's compact is particularly memorable).  His behaviour may seem odd to the rest of the soldiers, but his previous (American) personality (as a California surfing stud) becomes more hidden behind the mask.  Hence, he's able to ""go native"" and mingle with the inhabitants of the primitive society at the end of the river unmolested. Willard also survives because he is the chosen one, the white god they were expecting.  He comes from the same clan (""special forces"") as Kurtz & was chosen to replace him, however he had not shed is previous (American) skin & so he (unlike Lance) must be initiated with his own rite of passage (hence the mud bath to darken his skin & then being imprisoned) before being allowed in (which Lance does not have to go through). Chef, on the other hand, is still fighting the war by the time they reach The End, his character hasn't changed; hence, he becomes The Other/enemy to this primitive society and must be eliminated. *End Spoilers* The addition of the scenes of the french outpost were also a welcome addition, since they helped to develop the contrast between ""civilized"" society & primitive.  However, the  inclusion of the romance/sex scenes (from the end of the dinner til the widow & Willard are in bed) detracted from the movie because they were really out of character for Willard. However, the scenes up to the end of dinner illustrated effectively how ""civilized"" society copes in the face of adversity, with its private & emotional acts of violence, it's need to intellectually justify it's actions (in order to successfully ignore what is actually happening).  The political diatribes at the dinner table  felt a bit heavy-handed while watching them. However, in retrospect, they were a fairly accurate portrait of French-US encounters at that time. Outside of Willard's sex scene, the only other scene that felt completely out of place in this re-edit was the scene where they open their mail. Where did this mail come from? The scene definitely felt out of place because it was used (the playing of the tape from home) to heighten the dramatic effect of war while providing an explanation for how Willard got his updated information on Kurtz. The only thing bad one can say about this movie is that it magnifies how awful Hollywood films have become. Only a handful have been worth watching (LA Confidential, American Beauty, The Man Who Wasn't There) & only 1 (Brazil, which probably wasn't even a Hollywood studio) film  over the past 25 years has been able to match it in quality/complexity/development/cinematography/etc."

","From the opening scene - with ""The End"" playing while helicopters are attacking a village - to Col. Kilgore's (Robert Duvall) admiration of napalm, to the Playboy bunnies, to the final scene, ""Apocalypse Now"" always hits you like a brick in the face. As Capt. Benjamin L. Willard, searching for renegade Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), Martin Sheen has what was probably the best role of his career.<br/><br/>Above all, the movie is staunchly anti-war, even more so than ""The Deer Hunter""; ""Apocalypse Now"" condemns the fact that we were in Vietnam to begin with. The Playboy bunny scene not only shows that the GIs were shown the most despicable stuff for entertainment, but it shows that if you expect to create such emotions, don't expect to be able to control them (in that scene, you can see Vietnamese people outside the compound, and you can only imagine how disgusted they must be at American ""entertainment"").<br/><br/>Col. Kilgore is of course the ultimate rah-rah military type. Among other things, this ""patriot"" ignores a wounded man, preferring instead to go surfing. He doesn't even flinch when there's an explosion. As he cynically notes: ""Charlie don't surf."" All in all, ""Apocalypse Now"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. With top notch performances by the stars and great support from Frederic Forrest, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, Sam Bottoms and Harrison Ford, this is one movie that everyone should see."
"LuckyGraveyardBoots","10","5","9","9 May 2006"," quite possibly the best and most important film in history
","Even with all the cinema dealing with the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacob's Ladder, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Taxi Driver to an extent) one feels that we don't even know the half of what happened. Even contemplating the horror feels inhuman. And a progression - or retreat? - to the inhumanity that it necessitates is a key part of Apocalypse Now, Coppola's greatest and one of the most important films ever made. Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's 1902 classic, ""Heart of Darkness"" which chronicles the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that comes with distance from civilization - a surfacing of a bestial nature, as it were, a la Lord of the Flies - it brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam. The story is of Willard, a general commissioned on a special mission to Cambodia after his first tour of duty in Vietnam is served. Willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in Saigon, psychologically unable to go back home - eerily echoing Nicky in The Deer Hunter. So he is contacted: his mission is to assassinate a renegade Green Beret who has isolated himself in a remote outpost on the Nung River, and who has purportedly gone completely insane - worshiped like a god by the natives, and killing indiscriminately. This man's name is Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in the second best role of his career (the best being Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire). As Willard journeys upriver in an army boat with some soldiers accompanying, his witnessing the horrors and the insanity - and the overwhelming pointlessness of it all - leads to an eerie sympathy and identification with Kurtz before they even meet. By the time they do, Kurtz's methods don't really seem as wrong or as they should, and they certainly don't seem too unusual or out-of-place. Apocalypse - a place beyond morality, the outpost on the end of the world. The loss of civilization, the loss of judgement, of self. Kurtz's monologue about an atrocity he witnessed as a Green Beret, and his later revelation, is one of the most chilling and well-delivered speeches in cinema history. The film is about trauma, about the human spirit and its breaking point - here, it's a lot like The Deer Hunter, and just as good. Apocalypse, however, takes the boundaries of what we can endure to a global level - Coppola's sweeping footage of the humid, murky jungles of Cambodia and an opening sequence of helicopters amid exploding forests and an orange sky - set to an oddly fitting Doors soundtrack - as well as chilling scenes on the river and of an air raid on a village with Wagner blasting from speakers (a scene which has gone down as one of the most chilling, darkly humorous, and strikingly pointless war scenes ever) - this all contributes to the sense of Apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at some distant point in the future, but Apocalypse Now and forever. The Deer Hunter is much more up close and personal, you can even tell by the title, and shows the totalling effect trauma has on the individual psyche, the breaking down of the human soul, and its ability to either surrender completely to forces of darkness, or to limp on. This is why both films are equal - they are two parts of the same thing. In ""Heart of Darkness"", Kurtz is shown as conflicted between morality (civilization) and his inner savage. In Apocalypse Now, Kurtz has left all conflict behind. He is beyond good and evil. He has let go of morality like a drowning man lets go of a saving hand in the moments before his death. Kurtz indeed is only waiting for death, quoting T. S. Eliot in his temple to himself, lost in the jungle. His last words, and the words echoed at the end of the movie, are, ""The horror...the horror."" He is referring to the infinite void of existence, of the human psyche, and to the pitch black emptiness within his own mind, where atrocities are born again. It is impossible to express in words the experience one goes through watching this film - the experience, in short, that Willard experiences on his journey. The end part, at the outpost, almost in fact comparable to its brother scene in The Deer Hunter, is one of the most deeply, calmly, and seductively disturbing things I've ever seen."
"synicalsaint","10","5","9","20 June 2005"," A true masterpiece
","First of all, if you haven't seen this movie you've been wasting your time watching others. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes cinema. It is violent, complex and long, but nothing is gratuitous. So if you haven't seen it, stop reading this commentary (yep, SPOILERS AHEAD) and do yourself a favor.<br/><br/>This movie is one of those war classics that don't focus so much on the war, kind of like Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"". It follows Willard's journey into Cambodia, into his very own soul and into madness. His search for Kurtz teaches him that the man he was sent to kill knows much more about the war than those who are in charge. By the end of the film, Willard has become Kurtz, sharing his madness. But what the generals call insanity turns out to be the clairvoyance that only a man who has seen the ""horror"" can possess.<br/><br/>I think ""Apocalypse Now"" is by far superior to Conrad's short story, ""Heart of Darkness"", from which it is freely adapted. They share the same construction but while Conrad's story tends to be too slow until Willard reaches Kurtz, Coppola's film is never boring. This is probably due to the fact that Willard's companions have greater roles in the film. Each of the characters on board the boat is interesting in his own way. Of course, the acting is responsible for this, Kilgore and the photojournalist are two great minor characters.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is beautiful, the cinematography gets more more and more beautiful as the film goes on. The stylised lighting is so stunning, especially towards the end.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando's performances are perfect. Sheen's minimalist approach reflects Willard's empty and goalless life while Brando's acting and Coppola's directing make Kurtz one of the most captivating characters in the history of cinema. <br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is simply one of those movies everybody should watch. <br/><br/>10/10"

","Well, I guess everyone who has once seen this move could not have denied its status of a masterpiece. I couldn't as well. Initially, the viewer is served with the captivating, overwhelming song ""The End"" by The Doors, which I am listening to right now. The song very much describes the imminence of the events about to ensue. The greatest amount of the movie's grandiosity lies in multiple separate, self-contained scenes. One of those is the air strike undertaken by Americans while the Wagner's ""Flight of the Valkyries"" is on and there is a splendid juxtaposition of horror over the Vietnamese and the exhilaration among the Americans. Another wholly self-descriptive scene is that of Marlon Brando confessing with his tremendously pervasive and piercing posture. Robert Duvall's peerless courage and uncommon decisiveness is another completely different, yet scathing, character.

","Never before has a film been spoken of in such high regard, but been so disappointing to view. Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is the most highly acclaimed film to explore the dark underside of the war in Vietnam. It takes the viewer on a mythological journey through the war torn jungles of southeast Asia, but fails miserably to deliver what it sets into motion. The film promises good performances from its actors, and it delivers in that regard. The cast is loaded with talent, most notably that of Robert Duvall. His characters' presence in the film is short in duration, but very moving. In the beginning (like ""Platoon""), ""Apocalypse Now"" seems to provide a glimpse into the psychological impact of an anarchic Vietnam on its wartime inhabitants. The film moves along nicely as Sheen journeys to find his imposter (Brando) who has concocted a dangerous cult following in the jungles of Cambodia. Several incidents along the way (again, like ""Platoon"") give the viewer insight into how unstable wartime conditions manipulate every mans psyche.<br/><br/>Up until this point, I thought the film was quite good. However, it takes a horrific turn for the worse when Sheens men stumble upon a family of French aristocracy still residing in Cambodia. At this point, the film jumps into a scene of pretentious political and social discourse about American involvement in the war. This miserably long scene broke the continuity of the film, as well as my interest. Trying desperately to recover from this editing atrocity, I try to stay optimistic about the films' direction. Unfortunately, its continuity is further interrupted by another unnecessary scene involving fuel exchange for sex. Still thinking it would revive itself, I tried to stay as optimistic as possible.<br/><br/>Finally, Sheen and his patrol boat reach the site of Brando's cult followers, and the film plunges into absolute absurdity. It now takes the form of a cheesy pseudo sci-fi thriller, and plummets past the point of anything remotely reasonable. Disappointed by direction and exhausted from unnecessary extended footage, I had to finish the film. Brando's mythical character is enveloped in stereotypical, horroresque camera shots. The film now basks in all that is predictable and unreasonable. For filmgoers who wish to have your experience handed to you on a silver platter, this is a must see. ""Apocalypse Now"" is ruined by blatant disregard for fluidity and reason. Any philosophical implications the film wishes to provide are drastically overshadowed by a painfully cheesy and predictable story. At the end, it seems as if Coppola had no direction for his story. The ending seems forced and unnatural. If you must view, please find the original cut, not the Redux version. Oh the horror..."

By the way, the Redux version is OK, but not truly necessary, except for the French colonists' scene. It's the only one I really think that should have been in the original version. It's really revealing of the position of France in Indochina. It should be shown in schools to teach the meaning of colonialism."
"mattrochman","4","4","7","6 February 2008"," Highly overrated war film
","When it comes to films about the Vietnam war, I think that too many people are over-praising. Perhaps many from the generation that lived through that war feel a strong connection to any film about it. Perhaps the explicit horrors of war vindicates their stance at the time so therefore, it's more worthy of praise. Perhaps this is even a generational thing? In any case, the acting was nothing magical. Sheen looked more constipated than anything else throughout the film and his obsession with Kurtz is poorly scripted. The war sequences are not too bad, but hardly the best cinematic portrayal of war.<br/><br/>Moreover, the film tends to bathe in its own views, themes and self-importance. After a while, it become tedious (even before REDUX) and interest levels plateau.<br/><br/>Then there is the grand finale where we finally meet Kurtz and all is supposedly revealed. But while the quality of the scripting and performances lifts during this period, the actual plotting goes awry. While many will say that the conclusion places caps off an exploration of the dark side of the human psyche, I felt that it was more of a disjointed series of monologues that the viewer never really follows, nor connects totally with. The fact that Kurtz turned out to be a demigod leading a tribe stretched both credibility and sensibility.<br/><br/>Cinematography was fairly good and there are enough engaging moments which compels me to give it a higher rating. But drastically overrated and the ending borders on absurd. Full Metal Jacket was the best of the lot in my view and many others get my vote before Apocalypse Now. However, I do give Platoon a lower rating than this as that was woeful."

"Sfpsycho415","7","5","10","4 February 2005"," A little overrated, but pretty good----7/10
","I started watching Apocalypse Now with all the acclaim it has received over the years in the back of my mind. I learned a long time ago with 2001: A Space Odyssey that just because a movie is regarded as a classic doesn't mean i will like it at all. I sat down to watch the Redux (it was the only version i could get but i'm sure the overall film is the same) and fortunately, Apocalypse Now is better than 2001, but it is not a great movie.<br/><br/>The film stars Martin Sheen as an Army captain who is sent into deep into the jungles of Vietnam to take down a decorated general (Marlon Brando) who went mad and barricaded himself. He rides on a boat with a squad of desensitized soldiers down a river. Along for the ride is a barely legal youngster (Laurence Fishburne), a would-be chef (Frederick Forrest) and a stern driver (Albert Hall). Everybody in the cast does a great job, and the ride down the river is eerily calm with random spurts of violence which makes for a mostly exciting movie. There is also a great supporting role by Robert Duvall as a hard-ass commander who is a overzealous fan of surfing.<br/><br/>The movie really slows down, however, when the squad comes across a French family living in a nice house in the middle of the jungle. It really doesn't do much for the story and it seems to get forgotten in the later parts of the movie. Also, the ending is slow and just strange. I heard there was originally supposed to be a huge battle, which i would have preferred.<br/><br/>For movie fans, Apocalypse Now is a must-see, because most people like it a lot, but for some it is a pretty good war movie that's worth a look.---7/10"
"mdenvee","1","9","22","28 May 2011"," Like Lemmings running off a cliff...
","This is how I interpret all the baffling high ratings this movie has gotten from viewers. I believe people will 'make themselves' see a special, wonderful, intellectual movie where there is none. They follow closely with other viewers (like lemmings running off a cliff en mass to their peril). This film reminds me of Citizen Kane- how people immediately assume that movie 'must' be the greatest movie of all time. Can any honest viewer actually watch Citizen Kane and compare it to Gone with the Wind or Casablanca or On the Waterfront or Ben Hur or The Big Country? Citizen Kane will put you to sleep- but people think it's 'supposed' to be artful, innovative, ingenious masterpiece. Apocalypse Now is the same scenario. Many people have heard amazing things about the film prior to watching and thus unconsciously force themselves to find genius and great acting and great script where there is quite the opposite. Other people watch it and see a truly weird, eccentric, failed effort at trying to make a artful, philosophical explanation of Vietnam- an overdone effort with the mantra being 'the weirder and more offbeat and melodramatic, the better'. Newsflash- that kind of movie- making is easy. Being weird and is easy- and it's a strategy to overwhelm the viewer with nonsense to such a degree that even the most objective, critical viewer will conclude 'such a weird, sick, pointless movie MUST be art.. must be genius.. must be a masterpiece. Here's a hint to the other viewers who found this to be the best movie of all time- it's easy to be strange and eerily unconventional. The true masterpieces are those movies which are simple and traditional, yet we walk away from them never forgetting, i.e. Schindlers List, The Godfather, Braveheart, North by Northwest, Rosemary's Baby, The Graduate, The Deer Hunter, etc. These are movies- classics with great acting, writing, and music, and frankly are endlessly watchable. I think any honest movie fan cannot really say they can watch a sleeper like Apocalypse more than once- it feels like a bad acid trip. Words to remember- extreme weirdness is not a recipe for a truly good movie or even a half decent one- but judging from the ridiculously high reviews, it does hypnotize its audience into thinking they are watching something worth watching. Oh well."
"gbmadison1","4","6","13","12 May 2014"," Apocalypse Now Review
","Let's talk about Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece named Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>First of all it is important to have some information about the movie including the plot, the historical context, and the cast of course.<br/><br/>The story unfolds in South Vietnam more exactly in Saigon in 1968. Captain Benjamin Willard is designated by Colonel Lucas to handle a mission whose aim is to 'terminate' the obscure and mysterious Colonel Walter Kurtz whose insane and atrocious missions had killed millions of Vietnamese. In spite of the multiple hardships and incidents Willard and his boat crew had coped with, indeed they will be killed one by one and Willard will remain the only survivor, he will reach his goal killing Kurtz which had gradually increased during the boat journey, becoming the strongest wish he ever wanted to achieve at all costs.<br/><br/>The move deals with the Vietnam war. It was triggered by the will of some powerful countries like Vietnam (a French colony) to declare their independence in 1945. In 1954 was the battle of Dien Ben Fu and the French Army was defeated by Vietnamese, consequently Vietnam has been divided in two parts, the North being communist and the South being capitalist. Between 1963 and 1975, an increasing number of US troops were sent there in order to prevent a communist takeover in South Vietnam. Finally in April 1975 which was actually the end of the war, North Vietnamese troops entered the South and ousted American troops.<br/><br/>The main characters of the movie are : <br/><br/>Captain Benjamin Willard played by Martin Sheen. He is the US army special forces assassin and the protagonist of the film. He alludes to a certain kind of morality but he isn't really sympathetic and can even be ruthless. <br/><br/>Colonel Walter Kurtz played by Marlon Brando. He is regarded as Willard's foe and the aim of the boat crew journey. He has invented himself a godlike figure judged by nobody, not even himself. He believes in death as well as he thinks that it's his only destiny.<br/><br/>General R. Corman played by G.D. Spradlin. He is the military superior who outlines Willard's mission.<br/><br/>Colonel Lucas played by Harrison Ford. He is Corman's junior officer. <br/><br/>Apocalypse Now a quite complex movie.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion war is worthless and has always been the major problem of human beings. It obviously goes along with a serious loss of innocent peoples' lives and that infuriates me. Why should ordinary people pay on their back the mistakes of others who quarrel and never agree?<br/><br/>Insanity really disturbs me, especially the strange personality of Colonel Kurtz. A puzzling atmosphere is settled right at the beginning of the film because Kurtz is shown as a mysterious person that is to say, we don't see him but only hear his voice on a tape recorder when General Corman presents Willard's mission, I can even add that the sound of his voice conveys his hidden personality and his dark side which gets the upper hand on him. Why such an eerie personality and life style ? It's quite confusing because in the past General Corman acknowledges him as a very brilliant, outstanding and praiseworthy officer with wit and intelligence but his ideas were strange and something had occurred and turned him into a monster-looking man. Indeed I can suggest that his insanity is even leading his whole body and brain. He epitomizes the deepest and darkest side of humankind and he embodies the precise image of the devil. Furthermore darkness is a major element present in the film, it represents the complexity to understand the characters which darkens our thoughts.<br/><br/>General Corman also lifts the fact of a confusing war, indeed there is a mix between rational and irrational but here the devil side triumphs over the good side.<br/><br/>Before I end this I can add that soldiers are depicted in this film as clumsy. I had the impression they were on holiday instead of being in a fight. Their goal isn't patriotic but oriented towards home."
"Cass-wood1","10","3","5","8 February 2015"," A film for the ages, this haunting venture into the darkness of war and mankind is one of Coppola's best works.
","Francis Ford Coppola delivers the unexpected with 'Apocalypse Now', revolutionising the 'war genre' and allows the true ugly face of war to rear its head on screen. Based on the novella 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad, Coppola takes Conrad's tale of insanity, savagery and the darkness of man's heart, and brings it into moving life within the harsh reality of the Vietnam war. As I mentioned, Coppola delivers the unexpected. When the film begins, there is no John Wayne figure fighting a romanticised war, with the sun shining at his back. Instead we witness the breakdown of Captain Willard, a broken man, stumbling through the darkness of his hotel room, caught up in a traumatised delirium as he awaits the 'mission' that he longs for; setting the tone for the rest of the film, and Captain Willard himself. <br/><br/>From these first few moments, we are sent into a downward spiral, along with Willard, into the heart of darkness. Every step of this journey, both physically and metaphorically is masterfully crafted by Coppola, through the haunting soundtrack and cinematography, to the harrowing performances from the cast. To watch 'Apocalypse Now' is to truly be immersed in the Vietnam war, and all its darkest horrors, making the film feel completely separated from the 'war genre'. Instead, it very quickly begins to feel like a psychological thriller, or even horror. This becomes all the more apparent towards the climax of the film with the dying words ""The horror...the horror"" uttered by the mad Colonel Kurtz. A true summation I believe, of Coppola's vision for the film. <br/><br/>I could not recommend this film enough, especially if you're a lover of film, as for me, 'Apocalypse Now' is part of the fabric of masterful cinema. Its imagery will stay in your mind's eye, its sounds will linger in your ears, and its message will remain in your thoughts."

","Apocalypse Now is one of my favorite films of all time! I just love it, there is simply nothing wrong with it!!! Perfect acting, perfect direction, perfect writing, perfectly shot and perfectly edited.<br/><br/>I think Apocalypse Now is the only war film to truly examine the dark sides of the soul of man. And the film does it perfectly, by portraying most characters insane. It is a great subject matter, and an important one, to explore how war affects you psychologically. It's just perfect!!<br/><br/>I think the most perfectly shot sequence in the whole movie is the village attack at about 40 minutes into the film. With all the logistics, extras, special effects etc. it's a miracle that Coppola finished the film.<br/><br/>The Redux is, you know, it was good, and it contained well-structured scenes in it, but it slowed the film down. So whenever I am going to watch Apocalypse Now, I'm watching the original cut.<br/><br/>So I totally recommend Apocalypse Now to anyone interested in the Vietnam war, or just war movies. Like I said, it got great acting, directing, writing and editing. Apocalypse Now is AWESOME!!! 9/10"
"jtmelton98","10","3","5","30 December 2014"," Outstanding film, truly depicts what soldiers faced in Vietnam
","Apocalypse Now is by far one of the greatest films that depicts the gruesome details that is war. It is the only movie that shows how it drives soldiers insane. Marlin Brando played the role of Kurtz beautifully, only Brando could portray the sick mind of Kurtz as well as he did. After I finished viewing the movie, I played it again. Great adaptation of Joseph Conrad's book ""Heart of Darkness"". The film makes the viewer think about what they just watched, by no means is it an easy movie to understand. It honestly should be placed higher up on the 250 list because of how fantastic the movie is. The soundtrack of the film is even better. The End by The Doors really ties into the ambiguity of the movie, as the song opens the movie and closes it as Willard murders Kurtz. Fantastic job by Francis Coppola, who in my mind is America's film wizard. By far the best part of the film is the interpretation of it. Initially the viewer does not know how to swallow this 2 and a half hour film of what seems like utter nonsense, the interpretation of the film leaves the viewer in awe of how Coppola could possibly have created this hieroglyphic piece of genius."
"videorama-759-859391","9","3","5","17 December 2014"," Atmospheric and unforgettably brilliant war film
","Here's that offbeat Vietnam Coppola masterpiece, with the whop whop whopping sound of choppers cutting the air. Unlike a few Vietnam films, this one is plot driven, and I must say, the story is an original. It's the journey there that makes the film, as well as the fantastic performances, all round, notably Sheen and wildcat Frederick Forrest, although of course it's Duvall as the gung ho Lieutenant, spouting that film's famous line, who steals their thunder, before a couple of bombings happen behind him, where he hardly flinches. Is this guy invincible or what? It's the most memorable part of the film. Sheen plays a Colonel, who's been to Vietnam and back, where he's back in Vietnam, positioned at Saigon. He's summoned on a mission, to find an outstanding Colonel, Kurtz (Brando, giving us an enigmatic character in an unbelievably masterful piece of acting) and terminate (kill) him. Sheen must travel up the river, of course, through the likelihoods of attacks. It's the first Vietnam film I've seen, that features soldier surfing. Did they really do this? It seems surreal, but as a Vietnam pic, it's very real. Hopper, a bloody unappreciated actor, so much so, it's criminal, is unforgettably brilliant as Brando's master and protector who gives us that wonderful monologue, while talking to a caged Sheen, where it's fates being decided. The script is top notch. If ever getting a chance, read itr, it's brilliant. Sheen's tired, wearied voice so much suits the role, from which Harvey Keitel, was originally cast, but just wasn't delivering the goods. Even great actors have their flaws, as even I was dropped from a short movie once. The playboy bunnies that came to visit the troops, via helicopter of course (check out one of Frederick Forest's requests) is beautifully shot. As for the Redux I prefer the original, as it did stall the story, as with the French family, the movie didn't benefit from it all, as this bit, didn't maintain interest, and wasn't warranted. We as an audience, didn't really need to be informed about this. As for gore, it's very restrained, only occasional, but there is that sick, and little disturbing scene near the end, involving a goat being sliced up. Forever a Vietnam masterpiece, AN is an ambitious and larger than life Vietnam film, crafted by a masterful director, whose got unforgettable performances out of his actors, in a brilliant choice of casting. But AN is brilliant, in about everything. What's also unforgettable is the state of that shrimp, before Willard treks off on his mission, to terminate a man, who's mind has flipped one too many switches. Willard does have the choice of roast beef too."
"powermandan","10","3","5","10 December 2014"," A Phenomenal Achievement. Coppola Outdoes Himself!
","In high school, I had to read Heart of Darkness. Although it was a good book, I did not understand any of it so my teacher had to explain everything. It was a harder read than a Shakespeare play. Apocalypse Now is a loose adaptation that surpasses the book. A few years after Coppola does the best movies ever--The Godfather Part 1 & 2--he directs arguably the best war movie ever made. Apocalypse Now is inferior to The Godfather movies, but is a much better piece of film. This was ten times harder to do than Coppola's other flicks.<br/><br/>I think Schindler's List is the best movie ever made about war. But it is not a straight-up war movie like this. As a straight-up war movie, this is the best. Saving Private Ryan is pretty close. But Apocalypse Now has a different kind of approach. Spielberg tried to make Saving Private Ryan to look like actual footage. Coppola tried to make Apocalypse Now look real too, but make the look more revolutionary and usable in every kind of film. Another thing that sets this apart is the weirdness that Coppola incorporates, used from the story. Martin Sheen (in an underrated performance) plays a soldier who seeks out Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando. Along the way, he encounters many odd tribes and rituals. When he gets to Kurtz's kingdom, the weirdness reaches an all-time high and the result of his stay changes him forever. Coppola creates some odd tribes that is genius for movies. The general filming with stuff like cinematography is revolutionary and mind-blowing. Coppola never did better than this and very few directors have done better than this.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is a story about how war can change people and does the best job in showing how and why.<br/><br/>4/4"

"williampsamuel","10","3","5","6 December 2014"," The Greatest Film Ever Made About Vietnam
","I feel that I have gazed into the abyss, and that the abyss has gazed into me, for I have experienced Apocalypse Now. Sheer unremitting madness is what it is about, and madness is the form that it takes for much of its runtime. Coppola has taken the classic Heart of Darkness, crossed it with Herzog's Aguirre, The Wrath of God, and set it against the madness of the Vietnam War to produce a film that is darker, more disturbing, and perhaps more profound as any I have ever seen. Watching this, you will see the face of true horror, and you will be changed.<br/><br/>For any who do not know the story, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) must travel far upriver into Cambodia to confront and eliminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlin Brando) a once ideal soldier who has gone rogue and is presumed to be completely insane. And on his journey he will see more darkness than he could have imagined, and discover that the truth is far worse than any had believed.<br/><br/>Since this is a movie review, I suppose I should comment on the acting, production values, etc. They are excellent. The sets and jungle locations are gorgeous. The battle scenes, especially the airborne assault, are among the best Hollywood has ever produced, with massive scale, incredible camera work, and pyrotechnics that would be the envy of Michal Bey. And the cinematography has lent much of the film an otherworldly feel, like the most horrifying acid trip possible.<br/><br/>The acting is likewise excellent. Sheen's performance as the haggard, mentally exhausted, and increasingly disturbed Captain Willard has changed my entire opinion of him as an actor. His haunting narration sets the tone for the entire film, and his eyes speak volumes in every scene. They tell the story of a man who thought he had seen it all, only to discover that he was horribly wrong. And Brando, despite having relatively little time on screen, is truly unforgettable. He is the very essence of a man who is profoundly unwell, and utterly detached from sanity.<br/><br/>And that is what Apocalypse Now is all about, the retreat from any semblance of sanity. On the journey upriver, we are confronted with madness of every form and color. There is the blood-lust and near suicidal bravado of Kilgore (Robert Duval) who lives and breathes war, and simply does not give a damn about his personal safety. It takes someone more than a bit off to go surfing as enemy bullets are ripping overhead or to remark that napalm ""smells like victory."" There's the utter detachment of Dennis Hopper's photojournalist, who seems to float along in a state of perpetual high, mistaking the madness of others for true wisdom. And the sheer idiocy of Lance, who drops acid in the midst NVA invested territory, and who yells 'Look guys, purple haze"" as he envelopes his own boat in thick clouds of colored smoke, never mind that they're on an uncharted stretch of river deep in Cambodia.<br/><br/>And there's the more generalized kind of madness that pervaded the whole war. The madness of forcibly moving entire populations in the hope that they would be grateful to us for protecting them. The madness of rebuilding a bridge every day and defending it against attack every night, just so the generals can say the road is open, casualties be damned! Or the madness of sending high strung, inexperienced, dope smoking kids on a sensitive dangerous mission. Other than Willard and possibly the skipper, no-one on that boat had any business being in a war zone.<br/><br/>But all of this pales in comparison to the sheer insanity of Colonel Kurtz. He is a man who has decided that not only do the ends justify the means, but that only the most horrifying means will achieve those ends. He has absorbed every ounce of the madness he's encountered, he has fully embraced that madness, and he has been transformed into a fount of madness, spewing forth pure horror and infecting everything it touches. The truly scary thing is that even half dead; rarely stepping out of his quarters, Kurtz still wields more absolute power than any man ever should. His madness is mistaken for divinity by followers who will commit any act for him. He's like an aged Charles Manson, with an entire tribe of true believers rather than a handful of dropouts.<br/><br/>Even scarier is that on one level he's right. By embracing the horrors of war, he and his people have done more damage to the enemy than any comparable force. If we'd had ten divisions of troops as ruthless as his, we could have destroyed the Cong and the NVA, but only at the cost of our souls. And yet in his rare moments of lucidity, Kurt knows and understands that what he has done is completely beyond the pale of decency or civilized humanity. Deep down, he hates what he is doing and what he has become. He no longer fears death but craves it, because it is the only escape from the nightmare he has created. His only wish is others may understand what happened to him and why he became what he did.<br/><br/>And I do. I cannot condone, excuse, or forgive any of what he has done, but I understand. And seeing this film for yourself, perhaps you will too. I cannot lie. This movie is dark, frightening, and at times downright depressing. But it is magnificent. If you have the fortitude to gaze into the jaws of insanity, you owe it to yourself to watch Apocalypse Now."
"Blake_Wedding","10","3","5","19 August 2014"," The Gold Standard For War Films
","Apocalypse Now is my favorite war film of all time. It's also one of my favorite films of all time...bar none. With that being said, this near three hour epic is not your typical war film. It's incredibly disturbing...and sure, you could say that many war films could carry that very label, with either a analytical use of graphic violence to convey a message, or one of blatant and over- indulgent use of graphic violence. <br/><br/>However, Apocalypse Now is a different beast. It's a film that uses graphic and realistic violence to prove many things, but under the surface, this film's messages are much broader than one's preconceived notions might expect. It has a lot of impassioned disdain for the Vietnam War, and for that matter, war and violent conflict as a whole. But as the film slowly draws on, and the curtain is slowly pulled back, the plot comes alive with some incredible commentary concerning the human condition, ideas of mortality, corruption, disconnection, and many other broad topics and ideas. <br/><br/>As it nears its final act, the film becomes this mesmerizing piece of art that transcends the simple label of ""war film"". It becomes something much bolder and ambitious. It justifies its near three-hour run time as all the pieces of this seemingly never-ending descent into the darkness of the war come together to detail the darkness of the human mind. While the ending of the film might be viewed by some as slightly predictable, the overall outcome overshadows any predictable laments over its whole. Apocalypse Now is a film that is masterfully executed, in both its beautiful and sweeping camera work, and of course its fantastic writing and deeply intelligent plot. It more or less uses the setting of Vietnam as a mere plot device to drive on the study of its very flawed, and very human (or lack thereof) characters. <br/><br/>All the actors are fantastic, and excellently suited for their roles. Martin Sheen delivers a brilliant performance as the cold and convicted Willard. While Robert Duvall delivers a chilling performance as the surfing-obsessed Lieutenant Kilgore, with some questionable motives along the way. Even the supporting cast in Apocalypse Now are absolutely wonderful (as is Francis Ford Coppola's standard). Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper, Laurence Fishburne, Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, and Frederic Forrest all provide many excellent emotional undertones to the themes at hand. However, my favorite performance of the entourage of actors at hand has to be Marlon Brando's insightful performance as Walter Kurtz. Riveting, spellbinding, brooding, unsettling; you couldn't fashion enough adjectives to describe how this man literally stole the screen in the last twenty minutes of the film.<br/><br/>All in all, Apocalypse Now is big screen perfection. It's one of those rare films where sheer talent, and spectacular social commentary come together to create something ultimately timeless. It's one of my favorite films ever made, as it resonates deeply with me on its analysis of humanity and morality. A beautiful, sweeping piece of art."

","''Apocalypse now'' has two versions. The original, which was out in 1979 and the Redux version from 2001, which extends the whole picture by approximately 49 minutes of cut out footage.

Every technical element from the picture such as sound effects, original soundtracks, camera quality IS actually as decent as from the original, perhaps even better. But this is not actually important, is it now. I mean, you most certainly do not want to watch an extended version of ''Apocalypse Now'' just for a 'smoother' result, now do you. The main point of this new version was to get to see the movie completely uncut, to view the original with all it's cut out footage. And that, dear friends, is an absolute let down. The majority of the new footage is mostly simply pointless and boring to watch. In fact these missing scenes are SO dull, that they actually cast a sort of a shadow on the original movie in this version, thus making the whole 3 hours and 16 minutes of this film look weak and frustrating to sit through. Never have I been so disappointed in an extended version of a great film. <br/><br/>NOT Recommended. It's pointless, TOO LONG, and boring.

","""Apocalypse Now"" shows that something can be a great film and pretentious drivel at the same time. That is to say, it demonstrates the possibility of being both, without itself quite being either. There are some magnificently realised scenes, such as could be PART of a masterpiece, but in the end - when Coppola has run out of river, so to speak - the movie goes nowhere, because it has nowhere to go. And let's face it: the man, for all his virtues as a director, in the 1970s at least, can't generate more than the minimal amount of tension needed to keep his film going, to save his life.<br/><br/>Spoilers follow...<br/><br/>There are two mysteries regarding Colonel Kurtz: one, why he went insane, and two, why - given that the other commanders in Vietnam are guilty of bloody atrocities, too, and that the whole POINT of the war is to destroy - the higher-ups want to have him killed. The answer to the first question is clear enough. If we hadn't got it already, it's answered in the last really strong scene, when we see the patrol boat stop a civilian river boat and machine-guns the occupants (who, it turns out, are NOT smuggling weapons downriver at all). The wounds sustained by the woman on the boat are not fatal and when the shooting's over the pilot of the patrol boat starts talking about handing her over to the nearest group of ""friendly"" civilians for medical aid. Captain Willard is frustrated with the hypocrisy and simply shoots the woman. This is WHY Kurtz went insane (and it's clear enough why Willard would react to the same situation in much the same way; he works, remember, for the CIA). But why do his superiors care? Why do his superiors want him out of the way, when he's after all doing what they're doing and what they seem to want him to do? Maybe there's a good answer - maybe, for instance, they want Kurtz to die DURING the war, so that he won't be an embarrassment afterwards. But this is just a guess based on no particular evidence presented to us during the movie; and I don't like this answer much, anyway. (What's one embarrassment among many?) The point is, when a film sets something up as an intriguing mystery, it should at least have an answer in mind.<br/><br/>The main trouble with Kurtz as a character and plot device is that he's simply a swamp at the end of the river, something for the narrative to get mired in and never emerge. Even so, it was a pity about Marlon Brando. Coppola should certainly have cast a more convincing actor, one who wouldn't, in Danny Peary's words, ""contemplate the universe before delivering each line"", but it was an added misfortune that Brando simply refused to co-operate, and that Coppola had to edit the footage to remove as much of Brando's presence as he decently could.<br/><br/>Two of Coppola's technological choices deserve comment. He was absolutely right to shoot in Technicolor; indeed, every single aspect of the way the film was shot, was absolutely right. The vivid colours and endlessly rich detail, even the luscious beauty, only make the horror more horrifying. But he was absolutely wrong to use synthesisers to play the musical score. The music undoes a small part of the cinematography's good work (in addition to dating the movie badly). They should have used real instruments - ANY real instruments. The only use of music that really works is when a recording of Wagner cuts through the rest of the soundtrack, just before American helicopters raid and strafe a Vietnamese village."

","Like it or hate it, this film is a part of North American film history. Personally I think this film is over-rated. It's poorly translated from the novel, and badly over-acted by Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando may be acknowledged as one of the great actors of the the 20th Century, but this movie essentially begins his downfall as a quality actor. Martin Sheen never was a quality actor to begin with, and it shows when given a starring role that draws heavily on ones acting ability.<br/><br/>But, as I said this is part of film history. It's kind of like eating brussel sprouts for the first time. It's good for you. You know you should eat it, but you're going to hate it when you do.

","I have nothing but respect for Francis Ford Coppola. He is deservedly one of the greatest directors of all time and his style of film-making is pretty much inimitable. Yet I can't really say I enjoyed this movie. At least not the Redux version I saw.<br/><br/>First the good parts. It's a damn beautiful film. The mood, as they slowly drift up the Vietnamese river, keeps building and building and you can smell the heat and wetness in the air, feel the sweat dripping down your back, hear the hollow echoing screaming around you. The script was heavily inspired by the classic novella Heart of Darkness and that's exactly the mood and atmosphere they achieved.<br/><br/>The acting is also topnotch, with one glaring exception, and I've never seen Charlie Sheen do a more convincing role than here. You can almost see the cracks in their souls as the heaviness of the war settles around them as they are pulled from combat and send to face almost certain deaths as they hunt their elusive quarry.<br/><br/>It's a well-made film. Everything from camera-work to sets to directing works, and works so well, but the fact remains that's it's just too long. At least the Redux version. You can only stretch the atmosphere and suspense for so long until you start to look at the clock. That's partly the purpose and to this film's credit, any other film would have crumbled way sooner, but crumble it does, eventually.<br/><br/>I also have problems with Marlon Brando's performance. Apparently the man showed up hugely overweight, completely unprepared and pretty much being as unprofessional as you can be. And it shows. The final third of the film throws the suspense straight out of the window and pretty much the only question left is ""Brando, what happened, man?"" <br/><br/>I can see why people love this film. It's a haunting take on war, has amazing atmosphere, vivid imagery, memorable characters and as a whole there are very few movies like it. Personally I lost interest after the halfway point, but that's just me."

The tone of voice I'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: ""Everybody gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one. They sent it up with room service."" It is indulgent without being narrow and alienating. A good example of is Hopper's indulgence into aphoristic madness, generously installing lines written by T.S. Eliot and Rudyard Kipling into his stony monologues: ""I mean, the man's a geniussometimes he'll walk right by you without even saying a word, and sometimes he'll grab you by the collar and say ""did you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'if you can hold your head while all around you they are losing theirs"" and then ""I mean he's a wise man, he's a great man; I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas"" (The first one's Kipling, the second one's Eliot."

","If you're looking for a masterpiece, read the short novel this is based upon: Joseph Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_. The film is merely OK in comparison. <br/><br/>I like the idea of translating Conrad's anti-imperialism from the Congo of 100 years ago to Vietnam in the '60s. The Idea is relevant, once we look through the alibi, the self-serving excuses, and the supposed idealism of the US taking up a former French colony after they cut and ran from the independence fighters there. <br/><br/>But the film's ponderous ambition tends to become bombastic at times, rather than the bottomless ambiguity of Conrad's novella."
"ReggieSantori","10","2","3","5 April 2004"," One of the Ten Best Films Ever Made
","You can forget about THE GODFATHER, STAR WARS, or SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. This movie is one of the best there is and is only beaten by a handful of pictures. I'm not talking AFI here, but my own, more accurate scale. This wonderful film, that developed over more than ten years and nearly cost the lives of all involved ranks number 4 on my list of 100 best films, coming in behind CITIZEN KANE, THE TRIAL, and IKIRU.<br/><br/>APOCALYPSE NOW is not merely an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", but an improvement upon that work. This film defies genre classification. It could best be described as an epic, and as that it surpasses any epic made before or since. The scope is great, yet the atmosphere is claustrohobic. The setting is bright and beautiful but the tone is dark and disturbing. It is set in the Vietnam war, but it's not about the Vietnam war. Coppola said the movie was the war itself, but it's even more than that.<br/><br/>After 25 years in release and thousands of reviews, I'm sure you know the plot, but here it is again just in case. Martin Sheen (BADLANDS, THE DEAD ZONE) is Willard who does certain special covert operations in Vietnam. His latest mission is to find Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando- the greatest), who has gone mad deep in the jungle, and terminate ""with extreme prejudice"". He heads up river on a small navy boat with a mixed bag of men. They first encounter Robert Duval and his love of Wagner, surfing, and napalm. From there things get crazier and crazier. People die, the men lose touch with reality, and then they find Kurtz...<br/><br/>There are plenty of famous scenes in the film and a couple of candidates in the REDUX version (which I actually liked). The score director Coppola produced with his father adds to the already eerie atmosphere of these great scenes. Wagner's ""Flight of the Valkyries"", The Doors's ""The End"", Flash Cadillac's ""Suzy Q"", and The Rolling Stones's ""Satisfaction"" are all used to perfect effect as well, and better than would ever be done again. For use of music, the Du Long bridge scene is probably the most haunting example in the film.<br/><br/>The visuals in APOCALYPSE NOW are at least as good as the score (or should I say, as great). Coppola hired Vittorio Storaro to photograph his masterpiece. Storaro had previously worked on Bertolucci's THE CONFORMIST and LAST TANGO IN PARIS. Like those two films, APOCALYPSE NOW is visually perfect, every shot a splendid display of color and light. I mean this movie looks good!<br/><br/>Saving the best for last, as the movie does, there is Brando as Kurtz himself. He gained too much weight over the course of production to be the<br/><br/>Kurtz Conrad described or Coppola envisioned but he is still one of the most imposing characters realized on screen. Brando delivers the famous ""the Horror"" speech, not as Milius wrote it, but as his on great bit of improv. His few scenes are addictive in their power. Kurtz has cinema's greatest lines. This is really where all the elements of a movie come together in a perfect blend. With Brando's performance, climaxing a film full of great acting, this becomes a perfect film.<br/><br/>APOCALYPSE NOW is a must see film. Whether you're a movie nut or just somebody looking for a good movie, this is the one you can't miss. This picture spent the souls and minds of all who made it; the least we can do is watch it.<br/><br/>""Pray for your father."""

","...That's probably because my first-ever viewing of ""Apocalypse Now"" was in its ""Redux"" version - featuring around 40 minutes of additional footage that, in the 3-hour-plus product, apparently formed the crux of what was ORIGINALLY envisioned.<br/><br/>Oh, well. I buy it. Contrary to what most others thought, I didn't have a problem with the film's somewhat bloated running length - though I shouldn't really be able to judge, as I have never, ever seen the film before. Fans of the original tend to side with it, and dismiss THIS 2001 re-release as a cheap marketing gimmick (which most re-releases usually are). Nevertheless, I wasn't too bothered by its epic pace; this masterful Vietnam war picture had an impact that resonated with me all the more strongly BECAUSE of its longevity. The next week I ended up viewing the tighter, original 1979 version - and, while still obviously good, I found I somewhat preferred the newer version, for its fascinating additions that lent new depth and meaning to its images. <br/><br/>This is a terrific, and shockingly realistic drama, showcasing unbelievable performances from an all-star cast backed by a legendary director. Obviously enough has been said about the infamous ordeal that countless cast and crew members went through to make it on location. The result was well worth it, and provides an insightful, thoroughly enjoyable window into the hellish, surreal world of the Vietnam war."
"hunter1269","Null","2","3","13 November 2003"," Perhaps you're forgetting the most obvious influence...
","The most obvious influence for this movie isn't a movie, it's a book. Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"". Kurtz is the same character in the movie and in the book, and Willard represents Marlow from the book. Even the character played by Dennis Hopper comes from ""Heart of Darkness"". The book is about the colonization and exploitation of Africa by the Europeans in the late 1800s. The setting is on the Congo river, and they travel up the river closer towards ""Darkness"" or Kurtz. This is the same paralell as the river in Vietnam depicted in Apocalypse Now. I thought the movie was great, and much easier to stay involved with than the Stream of Consciousness writing style that is present in Conrad's Heart of Darkness."
"rzajac","Null","2","3","12 September 2003"," Interesting Redux
","Believe it or not, I have only just seen the redux.<br/><br/>What's interesting is what the redux adds:  For one thing, it better highlights the idea that if Kurtz didn't have a method, he did have (or had had) a goal:  ""Winning"" in Vietnam.  And this dovetails with another image from the original, nicely paired with a new image in the redux.  Image one, from the Playmate USO show:  While the Americans had myriad choices, the Vietnam had a choice between victory or death.  Image two, from the French plantation, reminding us that the French had actually built something there in Vietnam.  What did the Americans have?  The Dominoe Theory.  In other words, we didn't have s**t, and the redux drives this home a little better.<br/><br/>I love this movie because it's still a bit of a Rorschach.  It's a mystery wrapped in an enigma, or some f**kin' thing.  To wit:  Are we ever given a satisfactory picture of the meaning behind Kurtz?  The redux seems a little better at conveying the feel of approaching an event horizon, where morality and reality becomes more chaotic and splintered, and it would not be meet and right to expect to be able to walk away ""resolved.""  The movie resolves by resolutely evading a clear resolution.  But there are mirror shards whipping by our heads at 400mph, bearing fleeting perspectives.  Maybe Kurtz *is* ""America in Vietnam.""  Maybe we won't understand the meaning of the Vietnam War until we understand that the best picture we'll ever get of that is Kurtz.  Which is to say that we simply engineered, to the tune of $400B (which, I heard, only *just* got paid off), a horror show to fulfill our Daily Minimum Requirement for The Horror.<br/><br/>All that said, there were still a few bits that maybe should have been left out.  The scene with the Bunnies meeting and greeting the crew was unnecessary.  Specifically, Willard engineers the deal--2 tins of diesel for a couple hours with the bunnies--and this is distinctly out of character for the spartan Willard.  The scenes at the French Plantation were a mix 'n' match; Clean's burial; good.  Explanation of prior French integration into Viet society; good.  Opium and sex; again, glaringly out of character for Willard.  Any time Willard cracks a smile or otherwise distracts from his own proto-Kurtz philosophy has to remain suspect.<br/><br/>This was a great movie and remains a great movie.  See it."

","I read it in college and didn't understand it. This film is not exactly a war film, not even an anti-war, but alienation of people. From this perspective, if World War I is the entrance to the irrational world for the West, then the Vietnam War is the pinnacle, and the title of ""Modern Revelation"" points to metaphysical meaning. Although this film is undoubtedly inspired by ""Dark Heart"", it is indeed different from European culture (German-style war alienation focuses on aesthetics, especially opera-style life impulses). American culture is more violent and emphasizes autonomy. In alienation, the sense of autonomy is particularly strong. Kurtz is regarded as a lunatic (""The colonel is a lunatic, worse than mad, a demon""), but in terms of his self-awareness when alienated, he is still a typical American. This has nothing to do with others (Vietnam in the film is an orientalized Middle Ages or even primitive society), it is about self. This sense of meaninglessness and alienation has brought about profound trauma. It has not been seen in the American war against the Indians and the subsequent war on terrorism. It is an endless void."

"labontearia","10","1","1","23 February 2020"," The horror
","Apocalypse Now, directed by Francis Coppola, is an American's version of the Vietnam War. Willard, played by Martin Sheen, is sent on a top-secret mission to take out Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a rogue Colonel who has lost his mind and is dishing out the war on his own terms. The movie follows Willard and the crew of the PBR on their journey through the war-ravaged areas of Vietnam to find Kurtz.
Along the way Willard and the crew are presented with obstacles. There's a general who refuses to help unless he can see some good surfing, a battle where no one seems to know what's happening, and merciless and frenzied killing of multiple natives for no apparent reason. It seems as if Coppola is waging his own question along Willard's journey - is it just Kurtz that has lost his mind, or is the whole war itself the real absurdity? The movie seems somehow both realistic and fantastical. What kind of general would be demanding people surf as napalm strikes are dropping? What kind of battle is being waged when there's no one in charge and no clear enemy? (And yet, despite the films over-the-top-ness, for many American's, this was a version of reality.)
By the time Willard makes it to Kurtz he's lost almost all the crew of the PBR. And while it's obvious that Kurtz has definitely lost it, he's not necessarily as crazy as one would think. He poses great philosophical points (we send boys to war and expect them to kill people but tell them they can't write profanity on bombs because it's too obscene?) and, after the journey experienced throughout the film, Kurtz doesn't seem like that bad of a guy. There is excellent camera work at play during Brando's scene that keeps Kurtz shrouded in darkness, resulting in an almost mythical quality. We never really know who he is, but Willard does know who he is, and he is a man that follows through. Though he seems to take Kurtz' words to heart, he follows through with his mission and the movie ends on him reflecting on Kurtz' own words (the horror... the horror).
The cinematography is something to behold. The movie is visually stunning with sequences involving unreal aerial shots, explosions, boats, and more, there is something to be said for the production too. It all culminates into one over the top-action packed, genre bending (dark humor? Drama? Action?) must see film. 10/10"

The acting, cinematography and score are all top notch. I guess this originally was supposed to be directed by George Lucas, but fell into the hands of Francis Ford Coppola and I would not change a thing. John Milius wrote the screenplay to this and along with Coppola, he is one of the best filmakers in Hollywood.

","In Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, a soldier, referred to as Captain, is given a mission to ""terminate"" a mentally unstable officer by the name of Colonel Kurtz in 1970's Vietnam. <br/><br/>The film opens with on a scene of coconut trees with instrumental music accompanying this image. As the lyrics enter the song, the trees are lit into flames, the words ""this is the end"" being sung in the background. This effective cinematographic choice to open the films sets the overall tone and foreshadows the ultimate fall of some character or situation. <br/><br/>Captain Willard, or Captain, has been on tour previously, leading to symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and a divorce from his wife. Leave has led to him feeling unrest, and he seeks a mission to give him strength again. His role in the military has given him purpose in life and without it, he is lost. When given the mission to terminate Colonel Kurtz, he accepts with little hesitation. Unlike other war films, the protagonist's goal is not within the typical boundaries of war alliances. His proclaimed antagonist is a member of the United States military. Colonel Kurtz serves as a unique character, having once been a model officer of the United States, but falling from prestige due to some unknown shift toward ""madness"". However, he has a select following that honors him as a god, justifying his ever flaw. <br/><br/>As Captain travels toward the end of the Nung River, where the Colonel is said to be hidden, he is accompanied by a few soldiers, and meet many Vietnamese civilians along their travel. Each character serves toward a large social commentary of the effect of war on the psyche. When some characters meet an untimely death, the question of whether any humanity exists in war is presented. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, graphic wars scenes are interrupted by banter and social interaction between the soldiers. These scenes often allude to pop-culture as the soldiers seek some semblance of American life while oversees. It really highlights the unique circumstance that these individual's face daily and how home is the goal of many, though not Captain's. <br/><br/>At one point in the film, Captain re-iterates his mission, as though to reintroduce it. This shows how his reason in following through has changed. He had at once been seeking a mission, and accepted for that reason, but he soon comes to wish to interact with Colonel Kurtz. It is as though him and his assumed antagonist are not so different after all. <br/><br/>While the film was thought provoking, and had all of the aspects to make it a ""good"" film, I did not personally find it overly enjoyable. This may be due to its long length or my limited interest in this genre. Overall, I would rate this film an 8/10."

The camera work contributed to creating such a highly respected film, with the dolly shots, the long shots with the Vietnam scenery, medium to medium long shots, and the establishing shots of the ocean and sunsets. It was extremely well done, and the fact that it was filmed in Philippines likely allowed it to be as realistic as possible. Sound helped as well, with non- diegetic music playing during action scenes, building up intensity as the action would pick up. The character's were very believable, and they were dressed the part to make it for an authentic experience. With such amazing acting, and with the cast alone, this should be watched for all film lover's. It's got everything in it, but it is not a war film as one might believe. Pay attention to the cinematography and the editing, and enjoy the performances of those that made this film win so many awards, such as best cinematography, director, and score."

","'This is the end' sings Jim Morrison as choppers criss-cross the screen. No, Jim, it's just the beginning. The beginning of a 202-minute, drug-fuelled Vietnam war epic that follows a group of US soldiers upriver, deep into enemy territory, where they witness madness, come to realise the futility of their conflict, and are reminded of the heart of darkness that beats in all men. And like their mission, it's extremely hard going at times.<br/><br/>Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this wild '70s classic starts off brilliantly, with war weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) being sent on a covert mission to assassinate renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), whose behaviour and methods are proving an embarrassment to the US army. An early set-pieceâ€”an air attack on a Vietcong village to the strains of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyriesâ€”is hugely impressive, boding well for the rest of the film. The genius continues with Robert Duvall's unforgettable performance as bonkers Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, while a jungle encounter with a tiger, and a visit by some Playboy playmates to boost moral only add to the fun.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, once the group of soldiers arrive at a French plantation, Apocalypse Now Redux becomes as bloated and unintelligible as its out-of-shape, mumbling star Brando: the action slows down to a snail's pace, and the vast amount of narcotics consumed by cast and crew becomes more than evident, the film turning into a dull psychedelic haze of drug-fuelled weirdness. Dennis Hopper, as a crazed photo journalist, is particularly spaced out, acting like he's single-handedly snorted the entire cocaine supply of the Philippines. This half of the film, as Hopper might say, is a real drag, man.<br/><br/>If I ever decide to watch Apocalypse Now again, which I think is unlikely, I'll be sure to watch the original theatrical version. Many think it is better; even if that isn't the case, it's definitely shorter.<br/><br/>7.5/10 for everything that happens before the plantation scene; 2.5/10 for the rest. So that's an average of 5/10."

","Coppola's masterful war film about a Vietnam war captain(Sheen) who is on a mission to kill a renegade green beret who has set himself up as a leader of a local tribe in Cambodia. The film is written well by JOhn Milius and Francis Ford Coppola, directed beautifully by the master director who did his best work in the 70s and this one was his last film of the decade (although in my eyes 83' film Outsiders was brilliant as well). Apocalypse now is a long, detailed, poetic account of the story inspired by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness novel. The cast is great in this film, Brando, Duvall and Hopper are all great while the best performance came from Martin Sheen in the lead. It was also nice to see Harrison Ford, Laurence Fishburne and Scott Glenn in supporting roles. I liked the cinematography from Vittorio Storaro, and the musical pieces as well. The film was well done in all, a great war film. --- IMDb Rating: 8.5, my rating: 9/10"

"eacahill","Null","1","1","10 November 2005"," HOD vs ANow
","This movie is not about Vietnam as many of you have stated. It is an interpretation of the Novella ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad. Many of you state how similar the book is to the movie, which is obvious until you look deeper. One of the largest conflicts in HOD was Marlow now taking that last step towords Darkness. In the novella Kurtz is able to keep him from that last step but in the film, that last step is taken when Willard murders Kurtz. Also the representation in the movie is much..much darker than that of the book.The reason Vietnam is used is because of its similarity Africa. People during the war did not know about what was going on there just as the inhabitants of Europe were blind to the happenings in Africa. If you don't understand this movie read the book carefully(don't worry its short, that is why it is called a Novella) and re-watch the movie. It is very impressive to see the modern day implementations of the views Conrad was trying to impress. A quote comparison which has puzzled me that someone may know the answer to.<br/><br/>The Russian ""He almost killed me...because i took his ivory""<br/><br/>The reporter ""he almost killed me...because i took his picture""<br/><br/>Ivory is a large part of the novella,but pictures do not seem to be to important in the movie. Any thoughts?"
"djoker__","10","1","1","19 June 2005"," A long Journey
","The most interesting aspect of this film is Sheen's journey into his animalistic self. A self that only war can understand and a war that our civilization struggles with on a daily basis. Now, with regards to the juxtaposition of elements you have to admit the music in the gunfight from cruiser scene (playing of course one of my favorites, Hendrix) is one of the best. I don't think it gets much better then that. From the story to the crude acting, to the editing, to the set location, this movie is number 1 in my books. The only element that perhaps could have been worked out a little more thoroughly, because I was confused (okay, that's easy to do) is the detailing of directives scene in the beginning. But like I said, this movie will be remembered as one of the great post war movies of all time!"

","There are about 10 films ever made that leave indelible images branded into your brain, and this is one of them. Those who comment that the film ranges beyond war into the nature of human beings are on target. The film, like the book, spirals farther and deeper, down into the hot center of the degenerate human heart. Yes, it's a slow, crawling sensation, and like many artists before them, Conrad and Coppola use a river as the symbol of the life's journey we are all floating on, like it or not, as the riverbanks gliding by present ever-changing conflicts. The mad young surfer--the only survivor besides Willard--is yet another version of all the demented or alienated characters in literature who see the truth realized--the Seer in Greek tragedies, the cabin boy in Moby Dick, Jim in Huck Finn, the Pilot's Boy in Rime of the Ancient Mariner, the jesters in Shakespeare's dramas. In never-ending cycles of trauma and peace, both individuals and nations are repeatedly mired in moral dilemmas that create suffering and horror, and reveal the perversity of the human heart. But the soul is never extinguished."

","A great piece of art. Some people might differ about the content of the movie (wich is still great) but the ""production"" is amazing, the set, the cutting, soundtrack, etc are awesome. A different story of the world known WAR OF Vietnam, that shows us how people can become insane after or during a war. Proves the non-human nature of war, and how things can become ironic and corrupted by the power given by power and weapons to politics that don't know anything about peace, humanitarism, or what is moral and what is not (war will never be moral). The end is a little bit ""deux ex machine"", but it is still possible and at least is different. Even though, I think that the ""mission accomplished ending of the movie"" on a war that was lost by the USA is a little bit of American propaganda. But still a great movie and a better production"

","Lieutenant Willard accepts a mission to terminate Col. Kurtz and takes a journey of self discovery. Along the way there are many scenes of cinematic brilliance that filmmakers today just don't have the guts to make.  This movie is a surrealistic tale of the horrors of war with many first rate performances including a very young Lawerence Fishburn.  Robert Duvall steals the scene though as the charismatic Lt. Col. Kilgore.  Great ensemble work too from the crew of the PT boat.<br/><br/>The original (1979) is still the best, but the Redux (2001) version has scenes that I'm glad I finally got a chance to see.

Curious that it is set on a different continent and about a hundred years later, during the peak of the Vietnam War.  Apocalypse Now follows one soldier's mission to kill a rampaging colonel.  The highway for the movie is the river leading up through Vietnam to Cambodia.  Apocalypse is not about Vietnam, but about human instinct and the endless possibilities of insanity a man can reach.

","I know there are conflicting views concerning this subject.<br/><br/> In my book, both versions get 10 of 10, but if you have the time it is definatly worth watching the redux version.  Its just the little additions in the beginning and middle of the film that add to the mood and themes of innocence, desperation, and the dwidling goodness of man that can be found in the war.  The French plantation scenes seemed, when I watched redux for the first time, a bit long and unnecessary, mostly because I wanted to arrive at the Kurtz complex.

","The intro to Apocalypse Now is not just intense, but surreal and somewhat frightening at the same time. This idea pretty much sums up the movie. Not only are there moments of terrible action, but the entire film has a dreamlike quality. This can partly be attributed to the eerily poetic voice over, but mostly the cinematographer Vittorio Storraro is the one responsible for the nightmarish mood.<br/><br/>Everything clicks in the film: the acting, the direction, the writing, the production values, etc. Not one thing is wrong with this film, though many people find it to be boring.

"dragon-90","7","1","1","6 October 2003"," Stay On The Boat
","Tortuous anti-war epic that ultimately disappoints despite the fantastic cinematography and superb overall production. The performances by Robert Duvall (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor) and Marlon Brando, meant to be highlights, only reduce the picture's gritty realism and lose the viewer's interest with overly dramatized performances and, with Brando, at times unintelligible dialogue.<br/><br/>What saves the film, and makes it great, is the narrated journey of Captain Willard up the Mekong and into the dark reaches of Indo-China. Martin Sheen gives a tremendous performance as the super-serious unofficial operative Willard whose mission is to seek out the mutinous Colonel Kurtz (Brando), creator of a dysfunctional Shangri-La deep in the jungle. Plenty of action and more than one bizarre sojourn (particularly in the less edited Redux version) greet Willard and his riverboat crew of war movie personalities--wonderfully performed by all including a very young Laurence Fishburne as the gunner's mate, ""Mr. Clean.""<br/><br/>Together they traverse through all the ironies and confusing realities of warfare and keep you on the edge of your seat. Once on land, however, the movie bogs down into a badly scripted climax between Willard and Kurtz.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching only give yourself enough time to appreciate the pacing and by all means, don't worry if you never see the end!"
"chvylvr80","10","1","1","4 September 2003"," This movie is art
","Apocalypse Now is one of those movies that you can't take in all at once. It takes repeated viewings to appreciate the full spectrum and breadth of the film. Rarely has a film so spectacular and awe-inspiring been made, especially in regards to a war film. This movie boasts a stellar cast, intricate yet simple plot, emotional soundtrack, beautiful locations and cinematography, and a firm grasp of the horrors, weirdness, and confusion of war. Martin Sheen gives what is perhaps the best performance of his career. Marlon Brando provides a suitably eerie and mysterious air. Robert Duvall deserves special praise for his over the top portrayal of Col. Kilgore. The entire cast is wonderful but these three characters stand out. The journey up the Mekong river by the four man crew of the PBR and Sheen is at times funny, exciting, sad and soul-searching. The end of this film is one of the most atmospheric that I have ever seen, and borders on art. The 45 minutes of footage that has been restored to the film are for the most part,worthwhile additions. The French dinner scene however, slows the pacing of the movie and drags on pointlessly. It is the only complaint I have about this masterpiece. Bottom Line: Apocalypse Now might just be one of the best movies ever. If you haven't seen it yet you owe it to yourself to experience this one of a kind film."
"erwan_ticheler","10","1","1","24 August 2003"," THE HORROR THAT IS WAR
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS ""Apocalypse Now"" is probably the best example,together with ""Platoon"", of a war movie about the mental struggles of soldiers during the war.Of course the best way in America to show that is to use their disaster war:Vietnam.<br/><br/>Coppola shows us how the US troops were going crazy in this jungle where that had to fight.The main problem was that most soldiers were young,very young(the average age of US soldiers in Vietnam was 19!!).They were also pretty much spoiled(look at the scene in which they don't care about the killing,they only want to surf)and they didn't care about the situation.<br/><br/>The movie has several impressive scenes,like the ""Valkyrie"" bombing and the last part of the movie with Marlon Brando playing an insane US soldier who has become a killer in the jungle.<br/><br/>Also very impressive and the adding effect to the horror is the score which could very well be in a horror movie. Not to mention the central song of the movie:The End,by The Doors. This frantic song is very well chosen,especially at the end when Martin Sheen Kills Marlon Brando(kill...kill.....kill...).<br/><br/>The movie ends with a message that is clear as ever:THE HORROR....THE HORROR....<br/><br/>Although I've seen better war movies,it was unique in it's way and should be shown in a theater to guys like Bush,Blair,Saddam,Bin Laden and all those other war-wanters! 8/10"
"Angry_Arguer","10","1","1","14 August 2003"," Coppola's Curse
","Apocalypse Now certainly maintains a high level of production quality.  Few other films are as deserving of their Oscars for Best Sound and Cinematography.  Actually, it deserved more than that.  The entire movie is one visual trip after another and director Francis Ford Coppola finally understands the value of visual artistry that he avoided in his previous work.<br/><br/>As it is well known, the movie took forever to create and everyone suffered in the production.  Coppola, totally obsessed as he was with telling this story, almost went mad and wound up remaking Bram Stoker's Dracula.  In the end, no one came out the wiser as many of the cast and crew failed to learn any lessons from this.<br/><br/>The movie is an interesting Vietnam-period parallel to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.  However, the moods in the two respective stories are very far apart and nowhere near as similar as one would have you believe.  I am certain that the script for Apocalypse Now was written by Milius up until the eventual encounter with Brando, then Coppola took over.  You can tell by examining the differing level of detail and interaction.<br/><br/>The story up to that point is so brilliant in its not-so-subtle fashion of hiding the message from us that the audience feels more than a little cheated when the go ahead and hammer it at us for the last half-hour.  ""The horror.  The horror.""<br/><br/>As said, the sound creation and editing for this movie is phenomenal.  The transport us to a drugged-out, psychedelic battlefield.  Coppola's juiced-up camera work enhances the senses and tells the story gloriously with Martin Sheen's edgy narration.  The man may not be a splendid actor, but he presents a compelling case.<br/><br/>Even more insightful (or is it insane?) is Robert Duvall.  The scene of his introduction plays out more like a carnival than a war zone with different attractions that the camera passes by, none of them holding our attention for long.  Perhaps they were trying to create some kind of symbolism with Duvall's character in all this, but he is merely a nuisance and can't supersede ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning.""<br/><br/>Brando is the most controversial element of the story, of this I am certain. He is underplayed, too somber, and half-interested in his work.  If Duvall was a nuisance, Brando is a disappointment, not helped by Dennis Hopper's crazy photographer character spouting a load of rubbish everywhere.  Perhaps by that stage in the movie, everything was meant for explanation as the preceding 150 minutes hadn't done any of that.  I don't know...<br/><br/>Overall, a movie I have mixed feelings about.  I recommend one viewing of it (either the original or the mammoth Redux version) to anyone who considers themselves movie lovers, film experts, or wannabe filmmakers.  4 out of 5 stars."
"m.se","10","1","1","22 July 2003"," Redux equal to its original
","Apocalypse Now is perhaps, or in my opinion even probably, the best piece of film recorded thus far in cinematic history. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to see it in the cinemas, so when Redux opened in 2001 my expectations were, to say the least, huge, and the 21st century update of the movie didn't let me down. Nor was it better than the original, and I mean, how could it be? It was simply different.<br/><br/>The new scenes, which I believe add up to almost a whole extra hour in the Redux version, adds new depth and detail to the movie at first, but in the second half of the movie they are just as guilty of destroying some of the pace of the film, which in the original was so perfectly calculated. Willard's stop at a French plantation for example is, in a sense, almost a step back on his journey to ""hell"". These new scenes are however beautifully incorporated with the old ones and Coppola has done a wonderful job using his father's classical music compositions to create new music for the additions.<br/><br/>To sum things up, Apocalypse Now Redux remains as great a movie as the original with its superb score and scenes like the one where Col. Kilgore goes surfing, the crossing of the Do Lung Bridge and of course the big finale engraved in movie history forever."

","I should begin by saying I've never seen the original version of this film, only the extended version on DVD. I really was impressed by the caliber of acting in this movie. The scenes with Brando's Kurtz are truly unforgettable and Martin Sheen as the protagonist is in top form too. Obviously the material they are working from is top notch. The smaller roles like Robert Duvall's and Harrison Ford's were more than serviceable as well. The photography was spectacular too. IF this is the way the U.S. really conducted it's operations in Vietnam I can see why they lost to the more disciplined and committed Vietcong. I don't think we got ""peace with honor."" I believe that the U.S. Government didn't do all it could to win the war. I think traitors and conspirators whose interests were only their own, not America's, stabbed the American fighting man in the back. One day I hope there is a reckoning. By the way I rate the extended version 8/10. The reason I don't score it higher is that by my tastes it's not a film that I really want to see again. Still it is undeniably a masterpiece."

The story began with Capt. Willard (Charlie Sheen) being chosen for a very strange mission. He killed a lot of people, but this time it was different, he was sent to kill an american, a high decorated american colonel (portrayed by Marlon Brando). The trip until he found him had some of the most perfected motion picture scenes.

The same goes for the overlong French Quarter visit scene. It was way too long and putting the movie to a complete standstill.

","Apocalypse Now is not a conventional film and it makes no attempts to be one. Do not sit down and expect to see a 2 hour film with a structure to it because you'll be disappointed. The movie lurches along with action scenes interspersed into moments of psycological reflection. And then some simply inexplicable scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, the pace of the movie is fairly slow. Coppola breaks all the rules of conventional film making with the movie opening with no titles and shots throughout the movie of up to 2 minutes. However, in the context of the film it works well. These men aren't normal people and Vietnam isn't a normal place and the film reflects this. Through the narration of Sheen's character, Captain Willard, we get an insight into the human mind and how it reacts to such adverse conditions. Like Marlow in Conrad's novella, we follow the psycological change of the protagonist as though it is our own.<br/><br/>The disappointment of the film is Brando's character, Colonel Kurtz. Although a lunatic he is obviously a man of surreal intellect yet on screen little of this is developed. An attempt is made, through Kurtz's discourses to analyse his mind but it isn't done anywhere near as well as with Sheen's character. Having said that, in some ways this just reinforces the idea that men can sometimes get so lost within their own little world that those outside of them couldn't possibly understand them and perhaps this was what Coppola wished to portray.<br/><br/>Overall, Apocalypse Now is an interesting look at the workings of the human mind in an adverse environment and also an interesting interpretation of Conrad's classic novella. There is some excellent photography throughout the film and despite its length it does manage to retain attention through most of the movie.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Which is better? The original cut, or ""Redux""? My theatrical/literary timeline for this saga is as follows. I saw ""Apocalypse Now"" when it was released theatrically in 1979, and I thought it was one of the best movies I had ever seen. Then some years later I read ""Heart of Darkness"" on which ""Apocalypse Now"" is based. It's not an easy book; short, but a tough pull. After reading the novel, I disagreed about the movie's supposed close relationship to the novel and felt the two had less in common than many reviewers claimed. I had the distinct feeling that the closest some of these columnists had come to the ""Heart of Darkness"" was the Classic Comic. Then, many years later, I watched ""Redux"".  <br/><br/>The editing and additional scenes make ""Redux"" less a war movie than the original, and textually closer to the ""Heart of Darkness"" with its slow trip up the dark, tropical river.

"marshall89","Null","1","1","27 February 2003"," Mind blowing
","What words can describe the sheer perfection of Apocalypse Now? Here are a few for starters: Awesome, sweeping, powerful, exciting, and incredibly mind blowing. Francis Ford Coppola's illustration of mankind's dark side is perhaps the best war film ever made. It's also one of the best films I have ever viewed during my existence. It succeeds on every level possible. This film will meet all of your expectations no matter what, and it doesn't fail on a single level. If Apocalypse Now isn't an example of cinematic perfection, then I don't know what is.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING<br/><br/>Capt. Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen), a soldier who is growing increasingly tired of his inner city surroundings in Saigon and wants to return to the Vietnamese jungles, is assigned on a mission to track down and kill renegade Colonel Walter Kurtz, a madman assassin who is rumored to have set up a hideaway in the Cambodian jungle. Willard and associates Tyrone Miller (Laurence Fishburne), Lance B. Johnson (Sam Bottoms), Jay ""Chef"" Hicks (Frederic Forrest), and Quartermaster Phillips (Albert Hall) journey down the jungle river in a small boat. Along the way they encounter many strange things and people, such as  helicopter flight leader Lt. Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall), a boisterous, overly confident, and surf loving commander who heads a visually stunning aerial attack on a Vietnamese town while Richard Wagner's `Ride of the Valkyries' roars out from his helicopter.<br/><br/>
As the journey through the jungle continues, Willard's assignment grates his nerves more and more, slowly causing him to become like the lunatic he has been assigned to kill. With each passing day, the crew sees wreckage and dead bodies left in the wake of Kurtz, and the tension becomes insurmountable. After several crazy events, such as a Playboy performance turned into a riot by overexcited soldiers, an accidental murder of an innocent family, and the loss of two crewmembers, the small boat makes it to Kurtz's outpost, where dead bodies hang everywhere, and the words `Apocalypse Now' are inscribed on the walls. At long last, Willard is taken to see Kurtz, who already suspects that he has arrived to kill him. Kurtz believes that Willard has the right to kill him, but that he has no right to judge him just because of his wicked personality. He then sits in silence as Kurtz reveals his tales and thoughts of the war and what caused him to go mad. During his stay, a crazed photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) also tells Willard of his target's insanity and the admiration he has received from all of his `children', and the pressure builds on him constantly. Then, one night, as the local villagers hack an ox to death during a ceremony, Willard brings Kurtz to his knees. As he walks out of the temple, the villagers all bow to him and worship him as their new leader. They then stare as he and Johnson slowly float down the river as the final words of Colonel Kurtz echo. `The horror. The horror.'<br/><br/>Now, I have seen a lot of great war movies. But so far this has got to be my favorite for many reasons. The first one is the visuals, which could be the best in motion picture history. Even today, with most movies relying on computer graphics, they don't look the least bit dated. The amazing technical prowess of this film is first examplified in the beginning, which has the camera resting on a shot of a palm tree forest as the low `bum, bum, bum' of passing helicopters echoes. Then the forest erupts into a napalm explosion of flames and smoke as The Doors' `The End' starts playing. After that, there are hardly any climaxes that aren't visually breathtaking. The best of these scenes is easily the aerial attack. How could you not be swept away by such a perfectly filmed climax? Wagner's roaring symphony more than perfectly aids the thrill of the attack, and it will please your ears while the awesome camerawork provides a treat for your eyes. Just the sight of the air cavalry dotting the sky as the camera moves slowly back is enough to blow you away. If you were spellbound by the cinematography of Lawrence of Arabia, then you will love this. Apocalypse Now also does a great job of mixing cold and morbid humor with the illustrations of the darkness of war. Robert Duvall, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his blisteringly brilliant role as Kilgore, is simply outrageous. I loved the scene where a bunch of villagers try to escape on a truck, which Kilgore sees and says, `Don't these people ever give up?' He then launches a missile, blowing the truck up and catapulting the riders into the river beneath the bridge they were driving across. It's scenes like this and the part when troops surf the waves while the water is bombed that will bring at least a snigger out of you no matter how morbid they are. The whole surfing thing was just hilarious too (`Charlie don't surf!').<br/><br/>Among all of the great elements that make Apocalypse Now perfect, I think the one thing that really stood out was the darkness. Showing the insanity and the downside of war separates this from others, and the gritty images of hell that this film portrays are in-depth. Plus, they perfectly mix together with the deep plot. Like it or not, you have to give credit to Coppola for the grittiness that he put into this movie.<br/><br/>Well, that was quite a mouthful. But before I catch my breath, let me also state that this is one of the best movies that your eyeballs will have the pleasure to absorb. I can guarantee that you will love it with all your heart and more. What Coppola put into this work of art is something that you will never see in a movie again. It's so great, that there isn't a single word that can sum it up. So If you're looking for a great film that illustrates the cruelty of war, then this should be first on your list. It's got great actors (including a young Laurence Fishburne), wild humor, gripping action, and a strong and gritty story. A recommendation for all.<br/><br/>
***** out of *****"
"waltergl","10","1","1","19 February 2003"," The greatest movie ever made
","Okay, maybe not the greatest movie ever made, but certainly my favorite. Coppola experienced a golden age in the 70s, making four of the greatest films ever made (The Godfather I and II, The Conversation, Apocalypse Now), but this film, released at the end of a revolutionary decade in film, made in the worst possible conditions, plagued by mental and physical ailments among cast and crew, seemingly doomed from the start, comes across as a complete masterpiece, utterly absorbing for every minute and in many ways absolutely terrifying.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen, who suffered a near-fatal heart attack during shooting, shows pain and inner turmoil in every single line he forces out and every single facial expression. This can hardly even be called acting; when Sheen looks directly into the camera at different points throughout the movie there is no indication on his face that he sees it at all.<br/><br/>The same can be said of Brando's acting. As he rambles on about pilots writing obscene words on their airplanes and rubbing his thumb along his eyebrows, he seems lost inside his own mind. This is Brando's most obscure and inaccessible work by far, but it's a rush to watch him go over the top and down the other side.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper, Robert Duvall, and a very, very young Laurence Fishburne also turn in amazing performances, representing different facets of the insanity of war. Also look for bit parts for Harrison Ford and Scott Glenn. But overall, just sit back and allow one of the most immersive experiences in the history of film take you on a very dark, very pretentious (I say this with nothing but respect) journey into man's ""heart of darkness"".(11/10) (or very emphatic 10, whatever sounds more reasonable)"
"ljcjpjlj","10","1","1","4 February 2003"," What a great shoot-em-up movie!
","Apocalypse Now is another of those films that is about half dream sequence. First of all it is a great movie.  It has great characters: Sheen defines the height of his character actor career.  Hopper plays his Easy Rider character o a T,  but this time with a job and a camera. Duval, utters those immortal words ""I love the smell of napalm in the morningÂ…"" and ""Charlie don't surf!"", and Brando is at his best. It has plenty of Vietnam War action for you, whether you liked the war, hated the war or fought the war, and is a slam-bang shoot-em-up of the kind that has been replaced by the computerized action films of the 21st century.  Realism or the lack of it aside (your opinion, your call) one can't help caught up in Sheen's Willard and his mission to terminate the command of Brando's Kurtz ""with extreme prejudice"" and all the entertaining and exciting stuff involved in this purposeful character's quest.  Never does Sheen's character waiver from this purpose and seldom does the story of the film wander from this path. (when it does wander, you love it.) With ""Redux"", through the wonder of the DVD format (ever heard of too much of a good thing?) New scenes are added (swept up from the cutting room floor) and pasted in here and there.  A new viewer of Apocalypse Now Redux might not notice that the bits are added, even though the movie has gone on past his bed time, but a veteran watcher of it might find them annoying, irrelevant, and easily skipable.  To me the ""Redux"" version came down to this question:  ""OK, so they didn't change the ending, why did they change the end"".  In ""Redux"" I seriously miss the dreamy end with its combination of napalm, burning trees, The Doors and the final credits.  I'd give up all the cutting room floor stuff for the original finale."
"stefan-144","8","1","1","4 February 2003"," Apocalypse now and forever
","Coppola's apocalyptic vision belongs to an ever present now. The dark sides of human character, the purgatory we frequently create for ourselves, unwillingly - that just doesn't end. It is often said that Heaven is right here, right now - well, if so, hell is too.<br/><br/>When the soldiers take the boat up-river, deeper into a strange and terrible land, it is like going on the river Styx to that domain, where mercy ends. Also, it's the long and troublesome travels of Odysseus, before coming home - to find that home is irrevocably changed. And it's Stanley's long search for Dr. Livingstone.<br/><br/>Mythical grounds. The water of the subconscious, the jungle of irrationality - man's curse and blessing in one.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando is divine in his acting. As soon as he appears, the long time leading up to it just disappears, and he is a demon, a monster from the beyond - still, so real, so true as an archetype of human dignity, maybe the most fundamental of our talents, gone awry. The horror.<br/><br/>This is the first time I see the film, in 2003, more than 20 years after it premiered. I chose to wait. So many movies deteriorate in a much shorter period than that, but this one, I dare say, is enforced by time, and will continue to be."
"filmbuff-31","Null","1","1","30 January 2003"," Brilliant Excursion Into The Heart of Darkness!
","My highest praise goes to Francis Ford Coppola!  In this movie, he has<br/><br/>hit upon Joseph Conrad's true intention better than one thousand<br/><br/>English teachers lecturing together could have.  <br/><br/>I first read Heart of Darkness in high school.  At that time, the words<br/><br/>and images seemed as strange and fleeting as those in a dream.  I<br/><br/>struggled to make sense of what I was reading.  The entire story seemed unreal, as though what I were reading couldn't really be happening. <br/><br/>
After seeing ""Apocalypse Now: Redux,"" the meaning of Heart of Darkness, the original literary source of the movie, has become clear to me. The novel seems convoluted and confused because the author's intent is to<br/><br/>show the deepest depths of darkness in human nature and the despair and<br/><br/>confusion of the human mind when confronted by amorphous, total evil. <br/><br/>
Coppola brilliantly sets the action and commentary in the movie against<br/><br/>the backdrop of the jungles of Southeast Asia and the Vietnam War. <br/><br/>In that milieu, the images and action unfold in the same nightmarish<br/><br/>way as they do in Conrad's novel.  I think Joseph Conrad would be<br/><br/>pleasantly surprised and maybe even grateful at the way Coppola has<br/><br/>brought his novel to life.  <br/><br/>The characters jump out at you:  Captain Willard and the men under his<br/><br/>command, the men and women of the French plantation, the photojournalist apostle of Kurtz, to the irrepressible essence of darkest evil<br/><br/>personified by Kurtz himself.  <br/><br/>""The horror. . . the horror. . . .""  These words uttered by Kurtz<br/><br/>capture the essence of the movie and the novel.  The presence of evil<br/><br/>nags at us, disquiets us, disturbs us vaguely, even in our most peaceful and secure moments.  The dark side of human nature demands a serious<br/><br/>consideration.  It will not let us flee.  Its influence, its dark,<br/><br/>brooding shadow, is everywhere:  in the jungle, in our hearts, in our<br/><br/>souls.  <br/><br/>Conrad knew nothing of the Vietnam War, or even the two world wars.  He<br/><br/>lived before them.  But I'm sure that he could appreciate the perfect<br/><br/>atmosphere for his novel that total war provides.  Coppola is a great<br/><br/>illuminator of Conrad's intention and his own in ""Apocalypse Now."" A fine touch, a superb touch, worthy of an Oscar.  The movie and the<br/><br/>book, though controversial, are memorable on many levels."

","Many people say that Apocalypse Now is the greatest war movie ever, I do not agree with them, but I can understand why they like it though. The performances are good, production was good, I however do not like it. It is boring. It is not a film about Vietnam as the grunts would see it rather how a drugged-out Director would see it. It was adapted by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and they should have let the movie stay true to the book, but they did not. The length is too long, there action sequences are just not what is to be expected. The only thing I like about the movie is the end of it."
"jaesboxer","9","1","1","27 December 2002"," The Greatest Film About Vietnam... Until the horribly woozy third act.
","The first two thirds of this movie are, quite simply, the best depiction of the Vietnam War in film. We follow Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), journeying upriver into Cambodia to assassinate the insane Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), through the proverbial Heart of Darkness, into the deepest depths of the chaos that was Nam. However, as soon as we get to the destination, the film goes completely downhill. The final hour really has little, if anything, to do with the Vietnam War. Instead, we a treated to a stoned Marlon Brando mouthing poetry and musing on terror in the midst of a tribal commune in a demolished temple, with Dennis Hopper adding his equally stoned commentary. Thus, Apocalypse Now collapses in on itself. From the interviews I have seen with him, Francis Ford Coppola has always struck me as an egomaniac, and here it shows. The scenes in Vietnam are philosophically rich, beautiful, haunting, and expressive of the strangest war of this past century. The Ride of the Valkyries helicopter attack, with a surfing-crazed Robert Duvall trying to catch a little R and R in the midst of a heated battle is still stunning and brilliant. All the characters on the boat with Willard are widely drawn, and their journey upriver into the depths of the jungle shows a vast range of the madness that plagued the war. In Cambodia, however, the artistic philosophy of the film moves so far away from the characters, that it feels like one is attending a University lecture, given, once again, by the stoned Marlon Brando. As the redux, its worth seeing, I think, but most of the scenes don't really add very much, and some (such as the FRench Plantation), feel completely out of place and really hinder the pacing of the film."
"grahamsj3","9","1","1","20 December 2002"," Whew!
","This is one powerful antiwar film! The production was nearly derailed by a number of events (typhoon, major star (Martin Sheen) having a heart attack during production, other major star (Marlon Brando) showing up not ready, going way over budget), but I'm thankful that it was ultimately completed. The film world is a better place because of this film's existence. The film is very ""deep"" and can't fully be understood or enjoyed in one viewing. You should see it, think about it for a few weeks or months, then see it again. This film has several combat scenes but make no mistake, it is an ANTIwar film. I feel that the depiction of many of the US soldiers as spaced-out, drunk, unruly and overall un-military is way overdone. Certainly there were a few like that, but the majority of the US military at that time were a definite step above that level (I know - I served alongside them). All in all, Coppola's production came out brilliantly. Judging by the fact that it was recently RE-shown at the Cannes Film Festival, others also think so. Watch this one - TWICE! It's a significant film!"
"stewartcooper","Null","1","1","12 November 2002"," Left speechless by Apocalypse
","Francis Ford Coppolla's tenacious ability to produce a true masterpiece against all the odds is summed up by Apocalypse Now. The struggles that enveloped the production are well documented, yet, nearly a quarter of a century later, the film remains a real gem.<br/><br/>It's debatable whether Apocalypse Now is a bona-fide depiction of war experience; it's skill, however, is to combine chaos, mismanagement and human suffering with the 'horror' of war and brutality.<br/><br/>
Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's novella, Heart of Darkness, Coppolla brings out a string of memorable performance. Martin Sheen, undoubtedly, is the real star of the film, despite being credited behind Brando and Duvall in the titles.<br/><br/>Coupled with stunning cinematography and sound, the imagery employed by Coppolla is like poetry. The feeling of movement throughout the film - as the boat heads up river in contrast with the current of the water, diverted only by, in the 'Redux' version, the French plantation scene, which adds a historical and philosophical dimension - builds up to an ambivalente conclusion. The intrigue at the finish provides the most one of the most effective endings to a film ever. Few movies leave me completely speechless at the end, though Coppolla knows exactly how to achieve this."
"Seeker-7","10","1","1","13 October 1998"," The easy part is getting there
","Coppola's haunting tale of a US Army Captain's journey up a river on orders to ""terminate"" a US Colonel who has gone insane.<br/><br/>The story is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness', set during the Vietman War. Willard (Sheen) describes his physical and psychological journey in search of the enigmatic Kurtz (Brando). Travelling to the heart of the jungle, Willard discovers how Kurtz has gained his position of power and influence over the local savages. Willard's struggle to fathom his experience involves him in a radical questioning of not only his own nature and values but the nature and values of his society."
"tostinati","Null","1","1","15 October 2001"," Problems with the ending (Mainly)
","Contains spoilers. The problems I see with the film now: First, Dennis Hopper. At some point Hopper transcended (?) Actor and became a sort of floating Saturday Night Live celebrity guest host for life. --No matter where he is or what he is doing, that is what he is. His characters are never credible, and even more than in the case of Brando, whose celebrity is a monumental thing to sublimate as you watch him, you never for an instant forget you are watching an Actor. Worse than his simple inability to fit into a scenario where verisimilitude is important, though, is the fact that he threatens to undermine the seriousness and horror of this film, by reminding one of the incessantly gibbering, fluttering Disney feature length cartoon comic relief (think of the china ware in Beauty and the Beast). If, along with the reinsertion of formerly edited footage, they could have reduced Hopper's hammy drive-in movie level role (think of Waterworld), they should have. His appearance so close to the end of the film, problematic as that ending already is, is especially damaging. <br/><br/>Second, one is loath to say a clearer or more decisive ending would have been welcome or done the film a world of good. Yet after three hours of the most grueling verisimilitude, three hours in which you accept every surreal, absurd, horrific sight laid before you as Gospel truth, an ending that may act as a reality disconnect is a problem indeed. At the time of the 20th anniversary revival of Apocalypse Now, a friend of mine said ""It is a great film, but there is no way I can accept that the ending would have happened the way it does in the film in real life."" Not having seen the film at that point, I marked this off as a philistine gripe. It sounded like the complaint of someone disappointed that the ending wasn't a standard action film call-in-the-air-strike fireworks show. <br/><br/>Now, just after having seen it, my friend's comment comes back to nag me. I am forced to concede it is entirely possible that the films agonizingly scrupulous mounting of tone and purpose, one of the most stunning in all film, is damaged by an ending that may make the viewer balk, or at least question its verisimilitude. The end falters by removing us from the most horrifically concrete reality ever put on film --being stuck way up river in the middle of Vietnam during the war; could there be anything worse in the human imagination?-- and offering in place of the reality an arty, impressionistic, cop-out ending that puts a handy Subjectivist toggle switch on Reality/ Perception. Because of this, there is a painted-into-a-corner feeling to the ending, a feeling that an invitation to the audience to fill in the blank has been offered by an artist afraid or unable to complete his statement. The rigorously-wrought horror is dissipated. <br/><br/>Understand, I don't enjoy complaining about this major film achievement. There was no other director in the world at the time-- or maybe even now-- who could have made this film. But the ending is just such an incredible letdown. And there is no way a weak ending can erase the gripping power and brilliance of the three hours before it. But if anything, it leaves this film a special dispensation case. As it stands, Apocalypse Now belongs in the company of Erich Von Stroheim's Queen Kelli or Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons-- films that stand as classics despite weak or unsatisfactory resolutions resulting from third-party intervention. Maybe health problems, the strain of crippling financial worries, over-taxed energy levels and the weight on the filmmakers' conscience of Viet Nam itself intervened here, preventing Coppola and company from achieving a wrap up wholly commensurate with the astounding body of this film. Or maybe they simply couldn't bear to put a period at the end of the sentence.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, what remains is a complicated, genius film, far beyond the scope of a simple star rating system. (But be warned of animal slaughter scenes, by the way, that Coppola could only have gotten away with filming offshore. If this sort of thing disturbs you, maybe you should pass on the film altogether, because acts of apparently genuine animal slaughter unfortunately have been made integral to the layered ending.)"

The journey through the jungles along the river this special agent takes involves many aspects of warfare where lines become hazy.  Who is in charge?  Where is the enemy?  Who is the enemy? How much deadly force should be used? Where are we? Who can you trust? When does war become a quest for personal glory? The film asks all of these questions.

Coppola deleted entire scenes before the original release, scenes that have found their way back into the Redux version. <br/><br/>The original cut remains one of the most beautiful nightmares ever put on film. It is evident from the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness"" that Coppola himself was battling to stay sane on his own trip up the river, between budgetary pressures, monsoons, medical emergencies, a story with no ending, and a bloated, unprepared Marlon Brando who nearly sank the last three weeks of shooting.<br/><br/>Out of this madness came form, and as with art of almost any kind, it works best in its first iteration.

The enemy will not surround one and talk a lot before shoot just because he is a main character. The ""slow motion"" definitely weaks the point, if there is one; 6. Too much redundancy in the talk. ""I know what you are talking, can't you just show me something, bring me the feeling?!""; 7. Anyone with good equipment in such place can make very beautiful screen shots, but the filmmaker obviously lacks the courage to cut some out; 8. For an epic film, ""Pearl Harbor"" is much better; 9. For a more philosophical movie, go to see ""pi"", which is far better, although it only cost $6000; 10.

"FilmSnobby","3","5","13","9 October 2003"," Pretentious pastiche.
","Overblown, occasionally interesting, but mostly pretentious pastiche of Joseph Conrad's  *Heart of Darkness*.  The Vietnam conflict serves as the Ultimate Metaphor for Coppola, as he sends discharged Captain Willard (Martin Sheen)  up the Mekong Delta.  His assignment?  Dispatch a certain Colonel Kurtz, a Green Beret who has apparently gone stark raving mad in the jungle of Cambodia.  Along the way, Willard meets a middle-aged Robert Duvall who can talk about nothing but surfing  (and in a Southern drawl, too), and a small crew of your typical  'Nam grunts that accompany him on his boat ride.  The general point of the film seems to be that War is Hell, or that Man is a murderous savage at the very least.  Wow, man.<br/><br/>Coppola throws so much at the screen that some of it is bound to stick and hold your attention.  The scene where the Hueys glide above the breaking surf with Wagner's  ""Flight of the Valkyries""  blaring on rigged-up speakers on the copters is justly famous  (though nonsensical and over-the-top). Dennis Hopper in a brief appearance manages to steal the entire movie (""Did you know that  'if'  is in the middle of  'life', man?!"", etc.). Coppola's setting-afire of an entire jungle with Jim Morrison intoning  ""This is the end . . .""  on the soundtrack is an astonishing sight, though necessarily modified by the knowledge that this film continues to be condemned for creating some of the worst environmental damage in the history of movies. And there's a truly chilling sequence in which Willard stumbles upon a last outpost of GI's engaged in a chaotic, meaningless firefight with an unseen enemy.<br/><br/>But most of the movie is merely the boat ride, accompanied by some truly dreadful faux-noir voice-over narration  (""Accusing someone of murder here was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500"" . . . you get the idea).  Willard mulls over the spectacularly banal history of Colonel Kurtz, while the crew gets on each other's nerves.  In the  *Redux*  version, there's an excruciating detour on a plantation that houses a group of snappily dressed French expatriates, a 30-minute digression that was edited out of the first cut for a very good reason:  it's sophomoric.  Anyway, on it goes, until Willard finally comes face-to-face with Ultimate Evil . . . which turns out to be just a middle-aged, overweight Marlon Brando, mumbling inaudibly, snacking on what appears to be macadamia nuts, and reading to Willard alternately between old issues of  ""Time Magazine""  and T.S. Eliot's poetry.  ""It smelled of death in there,""  narrates Willard, referring to Kurtz' lair, ""Of malaria . . . nightmares . . .""  but we remain bemusedly unconvinced.  Perhaps it smelled simply of macadamia nuts."

","I watched this movie with my dad because he said it was one of the best movies he has ever seen, naturally i had high expectations because he usually has good taste in movies.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie i felt so sick and depressed i don't think i could ever watch it again. It was extremely violent, extremely long, extremely boring, and extremely weird. It could almost be classified as a horror film, and its supposed to be a realistic war movie. But i suppose it's message is to show how horrible the Vietnam war was and how people can really do horrible things, so i will give it credit for that.<br/><br/>It drags out for ages and never seems to have any storyline, just a few marines on a mission to find a crazy marine who thinks he is a god to a tribe. It is almost too violent but not in a gory way, but just horrible images of sacrifice and execution and brainwash. This film made me feel like crap. I don't know why so many people love it.<br/><br/>I'm giving it 2/10 because it is not a very nice film to watch but it does manage to put across its message. I can only recommend it to war movie fans who like depressing films."

","I have to say that I did not enjoy the film Apocalypse Now, maybe because I'm not a fan of war movies. This film was awful, it was boring it had no theme in my opinion. It was just dragging on and on and on. The acting was HORRIBLE, I thought silent films were 100 percent better then this. I think this had to be a low budget movie, because the special effects were something from the 1920s, I thought the camera work were choppy and the sounds were delayed in some of the scenes. I strongly do NOT recommend this movie to anyone, unless you enjoy low budget war movies, that you like to sleep through. It was confusing as well, i have no idea what half the stuff they were talking about."

","How this could rank in the top 50 in the IMDB top 250 movies I don't know. It was extremely difficult for me to watch this film, because I was so disturbed by the graphic deaths/murders of innocent Vietnamese. No doubt that scenes such as that were very realistic, and probably US soldiers did that and worse, knowing how much disregard they have for human lives in real life (i.e. The Gulf War, WW2, Korean and Vietnam Wars). I am extremely disapproving of war in general, and there is a lot of pain left over from these unnecessary battles that are lasting, for the innocent victims. If there should be a movie at all about how horrifying war is, it should not be graphic, intensely disturbing displays of mass murder; but a thorough examination at the psychological aspect of those involved with the war: the soldiers figbting against each other, the families of those who leave for war, the emotional scars of those who have lost a loved one. This is truly an awful movie, to say the least."

Harrison Ford does OK in his small role, but he is not really given much to do. Laurence Fishburne and Scott Glenn are both good too.<br/><br/>The bad, Brando is awfully over the top.

Without writing a spoiler i'll just say that Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz- for whose appearance you wait the entire film for- was a huge letdown. <br/><br/>Although Brando is inarguably one of the greatest actors ever, he was miscast and given vacuous lines to deliver to boot. The movie ends as one big melodramatic farce.<br/><br/>Additionally, the fact that this was a work of director Francis Ford Coppola who directed the inimitable Godfather films does not mean that you should watch this film too. It only means that you should go back and watch the Godfather again (and again). This is shameful compared to those films and it's hard to see any true artist wanting this sham attached to their name.<br/><br/>The only part that was at all enjoyable and made me forget how that the movie was going nowhere, were the parts with Robert Duvall as the macho commander.

The film is a superbly photographed, surrealistic and dream-like odyssey of Captain Willard. Martin Sheen is outstanding. The bizarre, weird, horrible and morbidly funny intertwine themselves so skillfully that you almost feel like you are there. One of the quotes always remembered about this movie is ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"". But when Duval says ""Charlie can't surf!"" That does it for me. When Willard gets to where Kurtz is it feels like one of those extremely bad dreams where you have been on a long search and you are dog tired and scared to death.But when we get to Kurtz he seems inadequate and not even close to what you are led to expect. The last words he utters are ""The horror....The horror"". The horror is Brando's weak personna and lacklustre performance.

","Some people argue that Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest movies ever made. After watching this film, I can understand their side of the argument. After further research into this film, I have only learned to love this film even more.<br/><br/>Watching Apocalypse Now is like observing a slow descent into madness. More than observing, the audience is actively descending into this madness itself. Martin Sheen as Captain Willard lets the audience get into the mind of a soldier slowly losing it. His performance in this film is unmatchable. As Captain Willard gets closer to his goal, we can see how things begin to unravel piece-by-piece. The river itself as a metaphor of the slow descent.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando, for his brief appearance in the film as Colonel Kurtz, shows the other side of the madness. The soldier who actually lost his mind and let the war consume him. Chilling and provocative.<br/><br/>And I couldn't help but notice that Harrison Ford and Laurence Fishburne made appearances in this film. Truly an AAA+ cast all around.<br/><br/>The set pieces used in this film are unmatchable. In a world of pre-CGI, practical effects were the way to go. And this film is far from short of that.

","What a film. It's one of those films that leaves you speechless at the end because your still trying to process what the hell just happened. Defiantly the best war film I have ever seen. It was both a spectacle and a horror. It's fucking haunting, seeing all this destruction. What coplla manages extremely well is creating chaos that we experience through the eyes of the protagonist. There's incredible set prices like the bridge and the city that play with light and fog to create this dreadful atmosphere and a visually striking picture that left me completely flabbergasted as to how they achieved this all in 1979. It's impossible to talk about this film without mentioning marlon Brando. He may be a crazy method actor but by god does it work here. He's shrouded min mystery both literally and figuratively, lit by shadows and shrouded in fog after the nearly 2 hour build up to his character and so after all this hardship and trauma they face getting to him, this performance is built up and resolved perfectly. I realise I watched the shorter version and there's a three hour version out there but one of my only criticisms is that he's only in it for around 10 minutes. Even so, it leaves a massive impression on the viewer which is what makes it so iconic.
Another massive contributor to this errie and haunting atmosphere is the soundtrack, splicing classical music to rock to the main oppressive synth score creates this mismatch of tones and styles that runs throughout.
Despite being surreal and horrific in places, it never stops feeling realistic, keeping this tangible horror of the story. Speaking of, this is a prime example of how to adapt a classic book to a different time period, taking the novel heart of darkness into the Vietnam war shows that this idea of savages and humans, ya and them still relates to this day, the vietnam war ending only around ten years from when the film was made.

This film opens your eyes about the horror of war and what drives people insane. It also laughs at the idea of trying to call one action murder when everyone in this war was killing unnecessarily. This movie is shot beautifully and has some of the best action ever recorded. The focus is never on the action during action scenes, it's on the people. You'll often see bodies casually laying on the ground as if nobody is effected by it. This is extremely present when they meet the villain, but you realize there's no difference between the corpses at the Villain's temple and the corpses in the burned villages, the idea of calling murder of one justified and the murder of another evil is just not a line you can always determine in war.

","Here I just want to briefly record some of the lines shocked by this film, and some of my inspired ideas.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective, the soundtrack, filming, editing, light and shadow, each can come out and praise. But in terms of content, it has reached an unmatched height in other war films. I never thought that war films could be shot like this. Unlike the previous war films, although they are all criticizing the behavior of war and the impact of war on people, they are rarely raised to such an extent.<br/><br/>The name Modern Apocalypse is also wonderful. How many people will be revealed to the people who have watched this film.<br/><br/>The reason turn Kurtz to insane
Why does Kurtz go crazy until he destroys himself? Or how did the war destroy a ""good"" person? You can get a glimpse of the other two or three languages.<br/><br/>In the war, all the human moral concepts are subverted, and you will start to fight for yourself, good vs evil. Although people will encounter many similar situations in their daily lives, the existing social rules and moral standards will restrict your every move. But war is different. Under such special circumstances as war, the rational conscience and moral concepts you believe in will be broken, and your self-struggle will not be as simple as before The temptation will be unimaginable. Therefore, once you reach your endurance limit, the inner evil side is likely to explode. After all, under the special conditions of war, it is too painful to continue to be kind, to become a evil person, or to live more easily without psychological burden.<br/><br/>2. Why US lose in the Vietnam War?
I feel that the whole theme of the film is actually, why did the United States lose the Vietnam War? The answer given by the movie is: Why fight?<br/><br/>There are two kinds of American soldiers. One is that they do not know why they are fighting. Even if they live on the battlefield, they still live like the muddled appearance of their time in the United States. For them, it was just a different place to serve. The other is just fighting for a concept called Biggest Nothing in History. They have a lofty ideal, that is, to fight communism and spread the concept of democracy, which will make them occupy the so-called ""moral highland"" in this war, and will cause most Vietnamese to eventually move towards them. Therefore, they may not need to do too much to make the Viet Cong defeat. Among these two kinds of people, there is even one kind, the war-weary represented by Captain Willard. As soldiers, they had to obey the orders and came to the battlefield. But in their hearts, they are tired of war. After all, after World War II, the United States has been actively participating in or launching various wars around the world, including the Vietnam War, and has also fought for more than 10 years. Status. In this war, Americans do not have the concept of winning.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the Vietnamese soldiers clearly know why they are fighting. They fought for their own land, for their own family, for all they had. What they are fighting for is something that can really be in their hands. Once they lose, they will face an unknown future, and the power of this fear makes them take up arms without hesitation. . In addition, their nationalist sentiment has aggravated their concept of winning. Even if they have differences within themselves, on the most crucial point, that is, they are Vietnamese and they want to fight for Vietnam, they have no doubt at all. When the Americans thought they were attacking communism rather than the Vietnamese, the Vietnamese thought that the Americans attacked Vietnam. So they are fighting for Vietnam, not those so-called doctrines. At this point, they have the belief that the American soldiers cannot defeat the victory.<br/><br/>3. Nature of War
In fact, the movie doesn't say much about the essence of war. It just shows the cruelty, cruelty and dirtyness of war in one or two lines. The most silent thing is that we clearly know that the war will never end.<br/><br/>4. PTSD of the War
In fact, this part of the personal feeling is closely related to the first part why Kurtz finally went crazy. People trapped in war always endure the trauma caused by the war, and most of these traumas are actually negative and negative. The most uncomfortable thing is that the more sober people, they will fall into the impact of war until they are destroyed.<br/><br/>I wrote some of my immature little thoughts.<br/><br/>Finally, pray for world peace."

Quite slow and confusing but if you get it then there's no limit. A landmark in War epic films with tough frozen reality like never before. I don't know how it fares with the historical accuracies but i will just talk about a cinema or a feature film and this is something hallucinating on human nature and it's effects. Francis Coppola's visionary film on Vietnam War could feel bore and quite confusing at the end but there's something most realistic that we haven't seen before. Either you understand it and love or you hate it completely, it's that much unpredictable. If someone really knows about this scenario already then there would more to judge rather than just a movie buff (like me). Apocalypse Now is an remarkable achievement in Cinematography, Sound and Production design and those 2 Oscars dolls came for the deserving guys. I personally found it slow but many times slow poison works more than the Normal one, let's see if i can love it more after the probable repeat watch.

","In the introduction to the most recent version, Apocalypse Now: Final Cut, Coppola refers to the surrealistic tone of the film and its avant gardist vision (that Vietnam turned capitalist?). But I wonder if a more apt description of its underlying esthetic is that of a surrealist homage to Dadaism, and rather long-winded at that; because the only firm opinion I could draw from viewing it this third time (my previous viewings were its predecessors), was that it was basically informed by a nod, intended or otherwise, to the absurdist elements of art as they pertain to film, with form prevailing over substance in a very spectacular fashion. Ironically, it was this latest version with its enhanced visuals and sound reproduction and effects that drove me to this conclusion, I guess because the narrative paled even further next to the ramped up audio-visual sensory experience, bringing out all the holes and glaring inconsistencies. One could argue that the absurdist element is a broad metaphor for war, in this case the Vietnamese war, but for a film that sets out to meticulously fill in the character of Kurtz the renegade Colonel through the eyes of Captain Willard the Special Ops assassin, both of whom one would assume have an inkling of the role of the US Military in the American Military-Industrial complex (Willard even refers to it as 'the Corporation' not entirely euphemistically), the received plot summary that Kurtz, having discovered the military isn't interested in winning the war, violating his principles as a warrior and a patriot, has gone insane and formed his own rogue army in the jungle of Cambodia to impose a reign of terror on those trying to depose him (one assumes from both sides), just doesn't ring true. For a Harvard grad with a Masters in History and member of the establishment, one would expect him politically savvy and cynical enough to know that war is business by other means, and that's it's not necessarily just about destroying the enemy and winning; or to paraphrase R. West talking about the military of the Romans: 'They had no use for the local potentates which would build up the Empire by raising their territories to military and economic strength; they wanted it as a defenceless field of exploitation for an international army.""<br/><br/>But the narrative would have you believe that Kurtz is an idealist who made his way up the ranks, only to discover that the military doesn't function like he'd always been led to believe, and his disillusionment drives him to fight against his own - to rescue the honor of the US Military and his country? Maybe he really is a stubbornly idealistic idiot whose actions are threatening the profiteering activities of the Corporation and the top brass and he has to be eliminated. I have a similar issue with the Willard character. Yes, he is essentially an 'errand boy', as Kurtz pronounces him, but he too comes across as naive regarding why the Corporation want Kurtz eliminated - perhaps it's his job not to dig too deep. In the final analysis, one can see the parallels with Heart of Darkness. In the novel Kurtz uses brutal methods to run his end of the Company's ivory business and his success threatens the job security of complacent others higher up in the office; and similarly in the film, Kurtz has discovered that the only way to win the war by fighting brutality with greater brutality, but the Corporation keeps putting obstacles in his path. But their motives differ. The former is in it for profit and promotion, whereas the latter is working for the greater good of his country and his own noble cause as a warrior. What they share however is that both are driven to madness by the exigencies of their jobs-lives, which is to achieve the greatest possible success, as measured either in ivory or battle victories, regardless of how horrific and brutal the methods, divorced from their conscience and morals, which in essence the modus operandi of raw, unfettered capitalism where people are mere actors driven by blind forces, in the market place or the the service of the capitalist nation-state. If this indeed is 'the message' of the film, that insanity and inhumanity are at the core of capitalism, where war is business and business is war, then it is even more lost in the latest (final?) version."

","'Apocalypse Now (1979)' is a beast of a film. It's an odyssey unlike any other, one that's just as interesting and tumultuous behind-the-scenes as on the screen, and you can almost feel the blood, sweat and tears dripping from every frame, with our protagonist's sanity coming only as close to breaking as Coppola's must have been. The result of the entire ordeal is an experience that's difficult to describe. It has an impact but also lacks a certain something, that intangible connection, that would really make it 'pop', so to speak. It's much easier to appreciate from a technical stand-point than it is from a narrative, as the latter is loose and unfocused while also lacking a real resolution. It may be the lax structure, which doesn't place all that much outward emphasis on character growth or 'plot-points', that leads the ending to feel less like a completion of an arc and more like the fulfilment of an inevitability. Still, there is a compelling exploration of theme occurring here. The way the piece uses its central conflict of Willard and Kurtz, who aren't really at odds but are simply told to be 'enemies', as a way of exploring the wider conflict is subtle but inspired. The story is a very personal one, but moments of Vietnam War examination and commentary seep into the narrative in interesting and unconventional ways. It's these moments that work perhaps the best, with the genuine spectacle combining with the horrors of war to make a comment on the 'validity' of - or Coppola's general feeling towards - the whole situation. When the piece slows down, however, the contemplative tone and harsh, hard-boiled narration can't always keep up with the expectations that have been previously set by vivid montages and brilliant practicality. There is a palpable dread that builds up as we float along the river, though, and eking out the meeting of our hero and his supposed foe is a wise move. When they do meet, their clash is marred slightly by Brando's ill-prepared performance which, while occasionally commanding, is generally not up to par and doesn't meet the admittedly elusive standards set by all the flick's foreshadowing. There's also a sour note when the real slaughter of a water buffalo comes into play, something which Copolla has since tried to downplay. This is an uncomfortable moment that is unfortunately extended and interwoven with a key scene, making for a cringe-inducing finale that honestly plays in pretty poor-taste - even if the contrasting symbolism of the two in-universe events works well. Overall, the film is an engaging and strangely hypnotic one that works when it works but does suffer from slow segments and some areas of discomfort. It is built upon spectacular spectacle and clearly took a lot of time, effort and talent to make. 7/10"

","That's what war is for Captain Benjamin L Willard, and it's why he had to come back to Vietnam and divorce his home life for another mission. This time he is assigned to assassinate US Special Forces, Colonel Walter Kurtz. Kurtz has gone insane and has occupied a small territory in Cambodia with its natives, ruling over them as if he were a god. The audience is taken along with Willard, through the jungle on the patrol boat headed up-river toward Kurtz's outpost, challenged to see the duality of war. War is indeed exciting, but there is a dark side, which is undeniably horrific. <br/><br/>I give the movie a 9/10 for its effectiveness in contrasting the excitement of war with the terrible pain it creates, and also its ability to unsettle the audience with the message that we all have the potential to become a Kurtz."

","Even I find it a bit remarkable that just this week I got around to seeing this movie. I was rummaging through the movies on the shelf at my local public library and found this one on Blu Ray. Of course the picture and sound are both remarkably good, and includes very deep bass in key scenes where it is appropriate.<br/><br/>Two versions of this movie are on the disc, the original 2+ hour version with neither opening nor closing credits. Also the ""redux"" version released a few years ago, it is 3+ hours long. While the basic story is the same in each, the longer version includes a couple of scenes cut from the original. Neither of them affect the main story.<br/><br/>The main story is about a rogue military leader in the late 1960s, in a good performance Marlon Brando is Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. He has ended up somewhere in Cambodia and off the radar. He is accused of killings that may or may not be justified in the context of the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>In an equally good performance is Martin Sheen as expert assassin Captain Benjamin L. Willard. he is called in specifically to do a covert mission, if caught he was never sent, to find Kurtz and ""terminate his command"", which really meant to assassinate him.<br/><br/>To do this a small crew with a small boat are assigned to him, and they head out not knowing for sure when and where they would end up.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so striking are the makeup and cinematography which take the acting of Brando and Sheen up to another level. My only gripe with the movie is how they made so many of the military guys seem like frat boys using bad judgment and acting stupid. I am Vietnam war age, I knew several who went and served and to me it disrespects all the thousands who went and did not act like stupid frat boys."

","Had to look up what 'redux' means. It means revived or brought back. So that is what it has been done to the movie, Henry said. Revived. Brought back to live.<br/><br/>It begs the question: why? Is it because Coppola keeps tinkering, never satisfied with the result, even if a work is hailed as a masterpiece? <br/><br/>Feels a bit like Star Wars. I heard it gets remade too. Star Wars redux?<br/><br/>At least this seems to be a definite version. A finished piece. A directors cut, but a bit more. I understand the movie itself has been improved. More vivid colors. <br/><br/>So what do you think? Is it improved?<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>I can't tell. I never saw the first version. That is more something you might have seen.<br/><br/>I did, but I was a long time ago. Hard to recall things. I will tell a bit about them, but you have to first tell me what you think of this version?<br/><br/>Well, I liked it, even though it was a long sit. 3 hours. It is a fascinating story of a descend into hell.<br/><br/>A bit like lord of the rings or Dante's inferno. A journey into darkness.<br/><br/>Yes. You see it in the degeneration of the crew of the river boat that is taking the captain up the river where he is to dispose of that rogue Colonel. And in the worsening of the condition of situations on the river and the river banks. It gets from bad to worse. The senseless killing and murders. And the dead get mutilated. The horror as the Colonel says in the end, the horror.<br/><br/>Would you say it's an anti war movie? <br/><br/>I am not sure.. It seems to be more than an anti-war movie, a movie about the human condition. Cause and effect. One thing leads to another and that leads to yet another situation. And the next step builds on the previous one. It is a chain of events that don't get broken. Almost a pre-ordained result. People could have changed the outcome, but they don't change. The result is inevitable.<br/><br/>Sounds a bit too philosophical.. I mean at any one time someone could have made a different choice. It's not like there is no possibility to make another choice, Henry said.<br/><br/>Perhaps that is what the movie tries to convey? That a choice could have been made. At any one time. A different outcome is possible?<br/><br/>Well. Perhaps.. It is however also an entertaining movie. Not gung-ho violence, but it slowly builds up. Only the ending is a bit.. typical.<br/><br/>I understood Coppola wasn't satisfied with the ending himself. He thought it was too tame for modern audiences in the theatrical version. But that is what some people maintain he said. Maybe it is really just a rumor. Or humor.<br/><br/>So can you say something about the changes?<br/><br/>I think that there are two major changes, which is the encounter with the French somewhere halfway into the movie, which lasts almost thirty minutes, and that addition of the sex scenes with the entertainment girls. Personally I find both superfluous. The first breaks up the journey and adds a totally strange sex scene to the movie. A french lady decides to have sex with the Captain, a guy she hardly knows. Why on earth would she do that? The latter addition does in fact the same, but the first is for the Captain, the latter for the boat crew. Neither I think is a worthwhile addition in my opinion and does not add anything to the movie but adding some sex scenes. Perhaps that is more 'modern'.<br/><br/>I actually liked them, Henry laughed<br/><br/>I bet you do.<br/><br/>Sex comes natural, Kristl.<br/><br/>Even in war?<br/><br/>Very much so in war.<br/><br/>Hmm. I get rather upset by flying bullets and such. Disturbing in the extreme.<br/><br/>I bet you get used to it. Even you.<br/><br/>You think so?

It may be too long for most people but hey; the Vietnam war was a 15 years long ordeal,so there, & besides;anybody been stuck in traffic lately.....?<br/><br/>the film is flawless but it is when we arrive at the Kurtz compound that it gets hacked a bit in my opinion.<br/><br/>the additional scenes from the Redux are not needed & changes an epic maddening war film into a loose rock n roll war film. The french plantation scenes give justice to the french life styles for it is typically french to argue about politics at the diner table & run away screaming.... In the love scene between Willard & the french chick; she can t even pronounce the word: love. love as in: all you need is love or i want to love your leg. If any beautiful woman can t pronounce the word love adequately then she should not be in an American film...I know she is french,i m french too. Additional scenes have been released in the new DVD apocalypse now the complete dossier. These lost scenes are far more impressive than the ones of the Redux. There is the monkey sampan scene,very art gore, & very reminiscent of Aguirre the wrath of God with Philips saying to Willard: that s coming from where we re going captain.....& i say:<br/><br/>we are back in business boys! The booby trap scene.......:very nice! Additional scene with Dennis hopper: this is the war man; you kiss it right on the mouth if you can stand it.........:some well deserved comic relief diatribes from the man himself. Additional scene of the tiger cage with the first appearance of Kurtz giving orders in french & first dialogue between Kurtz & Willard: its right to win,its wrong to lose....:a much much better scene than the one in Redux where Kurtz reads life mag to Willard.<br/><br/>Additional scene with Colby who had so eloquently send a letter to his wife back in the state telling her to sell house,car & kids; in both original apocalypse now & Redux his character is a mute zombie but in the lost scene he kills Dennis Hopper & when he is asked by Willard what he feels when he sees all the killing around him, Colby answers: i feel,i feel the recoil of my shotgun.......:now that is keeping with what is expected God damned it! What has always been weak in apocalypse now is Kurtz rambling monologues & it is my belief that Brando did enough material for his millions but that the director maybe was too annoyed or to burned out to deal with it. In both apocalypse now & Redux, Kurtz talks about gardenias & reading from the hallow men which is lost on me, but other parts of his 45 minutes death monologue could of been used. Marlon Brando said: it was probably the closest i have ever come close<br/><br/>to getting lost in a part, and ones of the best scene i have ever played.... That footage has still yet to be released.<br/><br/>Maybe apocalypse now will never be a complete completed work & that s fine.<br/><br/>It makes it more interactive & the viewers can finish it from themselves.<br/><br/>If apocalypse now is about war & madness,<br/><br/>& apocalypse now Redux is too rock n roll for my own taste then the lost scenes at the compound makes it more like a chaotic existentialist western on its last leg which i like.<br/><br/>Its the end of the river all right, what did you expect?"

This concerns more a moral and inward journey by an officer who is a loner and sees parts of himself in the man he is assigned to terminate. The movie can be dealt with in many areas. I have even allowed Ryann and Nathan (my kids) to view this movie with a sense of instilling them with the futility of so many wars. I am not a pacifist by any means, but I feel the underlying message here is still in the inner journey of a man torn apart by the insanity he sees surrounding his mission as well as the erosion of all values in humanity in each step along the way. Almost a sort of Dante's Inferno as he descends each step closer into Hell by moving upriver to his final destination. This is a very deep and complex movie. I do not recommend this for the faint of heart, but by all means complete the movie if you have started it. Be cautioned that this is intense and emotional in many areas."

What really shines throuigh is the various forms that the insanity takes. Martin Sheen is far removed from his West Wing role, a soldier who is co-dependant on the jungle and the horrors it brings and as such is a complete burnout, unsure of what happens when the troops go home.

","I think AN is a masterpiece.  It joins a very selective group of films based upon novels that give artistic clarity and depth to words on the page. AN clearly shows what Conrad painfully mulls through in Heart of Darkness--the hypocrisy of Imperialism.  Even though the U.S. military doesn't seek to colonize Vietnam, they do attempt to bring America to Southeast Asia, perhaps in an attempt to teach ""Charlie"" the value of surfing within a democratic society.<br/><br/>AN is full of conflict, but the most important one, I think, is Captain Willard's dilemma (which is the same as Marlow's in Heart of Darkness), his choice of a lesser of two evils: America's military policy / agenda or Kurtz's more literal vision of war.  In the end, I think AN teaches us not that Kurtz is crazy, but war itself is completely insane with its rules and regulations.  Willard sums up the absurdity of it all when he's trying to figure out the sense of charging Colonel Kurtz with murder: ""charging a man with murder in this place is like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500..."" says Captain Williard.  And he's right, but in the end he (Coppola's Willard), who tows the party line, just like Conrad's Marlow."

","This is a review of the DVD version of 'Apocalypse Now Redux', but there's not much added to the DVD of any consequence . The movie has a peculiar balance with the mayhem of the first half set against the almost spiritual journey of the second, but Willard is even at the start having some psychological difficulty with fighting the war so there is unity overall. (Even the stress of making the movie gave Martin Sheen a heart attack.) Coppola certainly succeeded in making an anti-war movie; there is little difference in the tactics of surfin' Bill Kilgore than those of Colonel Kurtz further up the river. Kilgore, however, has not (yet) been disowned by his side. <br/><br/>As to the 40 or so minutes added, the French plantation episode is interesting but out of sympathy with the rest of the film; you can see why it was cut originally. The rest doesn't add much; the Playboy bunnies in the mud just pile on the agony. As for the Marlon bits, Brando as Kurtz certainly fits the image of the old bull waiting to be put out of his misery, and we see a bit more of him in this version, but he doesn't fit the script very well (Kurtz is meant to be a very active 40) and ultimately there is no really credible explanation of how he became master of his personal hell-hole ('the horror, the horror'). Conrad in the book this film is derived from, 'Heart of Darkness' didn't do much better, so I suppose we shouldn't be too critical.<br/><br/>Perhaps this movie is best seen rather than analysed. Visually it is terrific, even if, as Coppola explains, the pyrotechnics at the end occurred in an effort to clear the site. We are by Willard's side the whole time (he is in almost every scene) and at the end feel we understand. This and 'Full Metal Jacket' will probably be the two American movies most associated with the Vietnam War and neither can be said to be in praise of war. It's interesting to compare 'Apocalyse' with 'Thin Red Line.' In the latter, the enemy, the Japanese on Guadacanal are purely military, but the fear, chaos and ultimate pointlessness are similar. <br/><br/>'Apocalypse' was lucky in its timing Â– by 1979 Americans were ready to re-examine their role in Vietnam. No studio would have released it in 1969, the year it is set. Twenty years later, it stands up as a piece of bravura film-making and is almost hypnotic to watch. I hope Coppola is still around to do 'Destination Bagdad' when the American public are ready to face up to the consequences of the next bit of military lunacy their politicians and generals are planning."

","I was a big fan of the original Apocalypse Now, and when the redux first appeared, I wasn't sure what to think. Would the new scenes be good enough, or should they have stayed cut? Thankfully, the new scenes really develop the film further.<br/><br/>The French plantation romance scene is a perfect example of this, as we get to see a more human side of main character Willard. ""One side of him that kills, one side that loves."" or words to that effect. We also get a moving funeral for Clean, who was in the old version simply left in the river. Clean in general feels more developed than the simple cannon fodder he was before. I like the fact also that the new scenes don't detract from the film's anti war themes, and the characters descent into madness, as the journey moves along.<br/><br/>The ending's still a bit limp, but when the rest of the movie's this brilliant, I'll forgive this problem. If you've only seen the old version, it is well worth checking the redux out, as we now get roughly three quarters of an hour extra footage, that really completes the piece. Robert Duvall's Colonel Kilgore is still the show stealer with his ""Napalm in the morning"" speech."

"BlackJack_B","Null","0","0","26 September 2002"," The twisted circus of Vietnam.
","This review is for Apocalypse Now Redux. I have not seen the original and this is the first encounter with the movie that Francis Ford Coppola is obsessed with. Some have applauded this new version, others have condemned it. This is my first take, as if it was the only version around. Here goes...<br/><br/>While F.F. Coppola is famed for his Godfather movies, he has spent his free time obsessed with his fine Vietnam War movie Apocalypse Now. In the summer of 2001, he re-issued his director's cut version and dubbed it Apocalypse Now Redux.<br/><br/>The film's plot is pretty simple. Martin Sheen is Captain Ben Willard, a man who has already spent too much time in 'Nam that he's prone to going a bit crazy at times. Willard is sent on a mission to go into the Cambodia border and eliminate a rogue Colonel named Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). It's the trip that's the true horror story, and it's a disturbing one. Willard and his crew find love, death, horror, bravery, and excitement throughout the 3 and a half hour film. It seems that one day they find an opulent house owned by expatriate Frenchmen and the next they find a warzone that looks like a circus that has been bombed to death. Eventually, Willard reaches Kurtz and discovers that maybe the two men have more in common than being shafted by the U.S. Army.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, what with a cast that has Brando, Sheen, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, and a teenaged Laurence Fishburne. The music by F.F and Carmine Coppola is very ominous and disturbing. The violence is the same as the music: strong, difficult to watch, and grisly. There are touches of M*A*S*H like humour, such as surfing in the warzone, and some memorable lines (you know which ones).<br/><br/>Still, I didn't enjoy this one as much as Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"". The film is way too long and scenes can go on forever. He portrays Vietnam as the Hell many said it was, but he overstates it way too much. They don't mar the film's grandeur; this is an epic, but it could stand to lose some running time. I liked it, but it just doesn't have as much bite as ""Full Metal Jacket"" had, nor will it be as memorable to me, but it's still a very good film. Your tastes will vary.<br/><br/>Some notes: the creative consultant was Dennis Jakob, a classmate of F.F.C. at UCLA and the man who let Jim Morrison live on his roof where he composed the songs that would make him famous. Also, now I know where they got the inspiration for the voice of Konami's Metal Gear Solid hero Solid Snake from: Martin Sheen's Captain Willard."

"Metacortex","10","0","0","7 September 2002"," ""An intellectual war between the two faces of horror""
","Let me start just by saying this: `Apocalypse Now' is one of the best films of all time, and definitely the best war film I've seen.  Its bizarre apocalyptic power outguns most war films.  Thanks to those satiric and yet very violent moments of insanity that show us the horrors of war in a more generally universal kind of way.  We are given the chance to understand (a maybe vague) but the most realistic vision of what war really is, how it afects people? and, most importantly why does it exist?<br/><br/>The story: a warcoholic captain by the name of Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen), who is sent on a (suicide?) mission up the Nung river to slaughter a renegade-green baretta colonel named Walter E. Kurtz, who has lost any kind of sanity on his desperate and tortured soul, fighing his own private war on the matrix of the horrors of war.  Willard is sent on a navy PBR boat with a bunch of other American soldiers, that where sent to help him; although this would end on a futile effort to improve the mission, since every character on the boat literally becomes (on his behavior) what they really think of war, while they are entering deeply into the Nung river, deeply into the last level of insanity a man can really take.<br/><br/>The writing: John Milius's and Francis Ford Coppola's writing is amazing by not saying that its perfect.  Since their screenplay was based on the book `Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad, and wonderfully translated on the Vietnam War.  In other words: the satiric feel that is attached to the film is thanks to his great script, which also, has taken many multi-dimensional feelings and ideas on it, that pinpoint the ridiculous idea that war is (in an intelligent and dark way).  And that's basically (in fact, only a glimpse) the brilliance that is brought by the script of Coppola and Milius. Another positive point on the script, is the great narration by Michael Herr, which helps the film in visualizing how men really think during war, and why do men worship it (I really don't want to spoil much, but I felt that any person that has not seen this film should know this).  Still Herr's writing skills cannot be matched by what Milius and Coppola bring us to screen (especially check out the Col. Kurtz monologue about his philosophies on war).<br/><br/>The directing: Coppola's direction is breathtaking, as he literally brings `an intellectual horror film' into a war whose only objective was to reach a level of madness, in order for one side to win.  Anyway, he constantly uses superb symbolism: showing the characters into shadows, excellent editing that points out what exactly is going on with each of the characters minds and what they went through (especially check out the beginning showing the war on Willard's mind while playing `The End' performed by The Doors).  In other words, Coppola creates a truthful atmosphere with a horrorific vision of what really happens in war.  Another addition to the direction would be the sound that this movie expresses, everything hears realistically and as detailed as possible, everything comes to life, in order to give us (as I said before) a creepy atmosphere and also a description on how the characters feel.  If you watch this film again and again, you will connect some sounds to what the characters are saying (Well, I hope is not my imagination, anyhow, the film has a different interpretation on most individuals).<br/><br/>The acting: Well... what can I say? Its... unreal.  Martin Sheen gives us his best performance ever, he literally brings to life his character with suffocating and observating looks, a narration that philosophies on war, and with a thinking: of pour hope of life in this world.  Marlon Brando (although not wanting to cooperate totally in the project) still gives us a fascinating piece on acting performance.  His tortured expressions and voice acting are magnificent and fits perfectly on our visualization of someone gone completely insane by the horrors of war (THIS AIN'T NO SPOILER).  But the one that steals the whole film is got to be Robert Duval playing his legendary character Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore.  Duval shouts and speaks like if everything is just fine, he tries to make of war as a whole big joke, and that is why this character is that famous, because the result is a moving satiristic performance that shows the audiences: innocent people getting killed, and yet we don't even care.  But Duval's performance is so tremendously great... that he isn't scary, he isn't completely bad (alright he is... kind of wacko)... he's none of that... but he ironically makes you laugh.  And that is a fact.  Phrases like `I love the smell of napalm in the morning', `Charlie don't surf', and `Any man brave enough to have his guts out he can drink from my canteen any day' are classic, in fact almost every word spilled out by the mouth of Duval in this film, is immortal.<br/><br/>All in all, `Apocalypse Now' is one of those motion pictures that deserve to have the title of: one of the best of all time.  Masterpiece moments like the village attack with Duval in it (while some American soldiers surf on the same beach), moments like the Playboy scene which show how the government made a war gone mad, and the final scene on Kurtz compound, are just plain classic that infiltrate in our minds and point out: the dark side in every man's soul, and how it controls us by creating stupid things like: war.  In a way, `Apocalypse Now' is also the most moving antiwar film, thanks to the straight message that I've just stated, and how it is given (by showing rain, fire, shadows, violence, horror, evil, insanity, etc). In fact, the message is so though provoking that (if understanded) it becomes a depressive one, because it mainly tells this: THE HORROR... THE HORROR OF WAR.  And that's what the film is all about."

","In 1902 Joseph Conrad wrote a story based on his own experiences called 'Heart of Darkness', which is about a steamboat captain travelling up the Congo. The captain witnesses the appalling effects of Belgian imperialism on the Africans as he slowly moves deeper and deeper into the jungle, where he will meet Kurtz, a formerly brilliant Belgian agent who has gone mad. It is a story of civilisation and savagery, and it is one of the great works of English literature.<br/><br/>In 1979 Francis Ford Coppola released 'Apocalypse Now', a movie based on Conrad's tale but about a different form of colonisation. Set during the Vietnam War, it is the story of Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who travels upriver with a boat of mostly young soldiers on an assignment to 'terminate the command' of Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a formerly brilliant special forces officer who has gone rogue. For all their hardware, for all their awesome technologies of death, the Americans are losing the war because they simply will not go as far, will not give as much as the Viet Cong. Nor can they win over the Vietnamese people, because they do not really care about them. They are tools, a means of stopping Communism from spreading to somewhere really important, and they are treated as such. Kurtz has decided to change this: he is leading a cult who will do anything to win. Anything.<br/><br/>The version that I have seen is a new, longer cut called 'Apocalypse Now Redux'. I have not seen the original so I cannot say if it is an improvement, but what can say is that Redux is a masterpiece. It is the best war movie I have seen: it shows modern battle in both its awful glory and its muddy, bloody wretchedness. The sun sets, golden behind dark trees, the jungle explodes in flames, choppers whir in and out of earshot, bullets zip out of the foliage, men and women lose their minds and lives. It shows, in a series of lurid scenes, what the war, the jungle and the heat have brought out in the men: their brutality, their casual race and sexism, the crumbling of their humanity. Though it seems pompous to say so - a silly feeling, as like all art movies can be more than just entertainment - this is a profound film. <br/><br/>However it could have been better. I could have done without the manic and rather irritating photojournalist played by Dennis Hopper: what he tells us about Kurtz could have been shown to us directly, or been spoken by the man himself. There is also a sequence set on a French plantation that was added by Coppola. The soldiers have a break from the war, bury a dead comrade, over dinner there is a discussion about the war in a wider context, and Willard has a romantic encounter with a lonely French woman. In itself it these are good scenes, but they breaks up the momentum of the movie. As the soldiers have been going deeper into the heart of darkness, facing horrors that have gotten more and more intense, this relatively peaceful episode dissipates some of the tension that has built up. It also lengthens what is already a very long movie.<br/><br/>That aside, in the blackness of a movie theatre, with the screen taking up my whole field of vision, the sound of The Doors' eerie 'This Is The End' filling my ears, from the beginning of the movie to the end I was riveted to my seat. There is a famous scene where choppers come out of the blue horizon, Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries' thundering from their speakers, and rain death apon a village where the terrified Vietnamese scurry like insects. It is terrible and beautiful, grotesque and exhilarating. It is like reading Revelations. It may be what the Apocalypse feels like.<br/><br/>9 1/2 / 10"

","This is film is truly incredible.  The action is so real, it is like a live documentary.  Coppola paints a horrific vision of the tragedy and madness of the Vietnam war.  It is so interesting that it took 16 months to film, well over its expectancy and the fact that Coppola also had to use his own personal income to complete after it dramatically exceeded budgets.<br/><br/>
It doesn't require any intellectual understanding, although the film is intellectually remarkable. The American soldiers in the Vietnam War jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country, aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against. It was a war gone mad, like all other wars, without purpose or dignity. It was a pure act of humanity: to destroy and restore their own greedy needs. This is a film in which there is no saviour, where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed, anger, foolishness and egoism. As Coppola once said about the film: 'This film isn't about Vietnam. This film IS Vietnam'. He was right to the date. During the current situations of the world, where they are trying to protect their own skin, the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent. It is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation. It asks for realism.  A true masterpiece."

","No movie will ever come out like this one. Try as they might, they will never manage to reproduce the way this film feels, looks, sound and even tastes. Because filming during 16 months (that's almost a year and a half) in the Phillipines, during a war in that country, with a director on the verge of suicide and actors on the verge of breakdown will never again be tried by any sensible production company. A pity then, that we won't get another shot at something like this, but that's what makes this movie so unique. This is the ultimate example of how from chaos comes perfection. Everything about it is absolutely spectacular, and strangely crafted, considering the production conditions, which makes us think about what was the academy thinking about when they acclaimed ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" against this colossal masterpiece, only granting it two oscars.

Made in an era where there was no CGI, your jaw will drop in some shots, where more than 20 helicopters pass in front of the camera lenses, while a tank destroys a hut by the river, with thousands of extras running by. This was the ultimate challenge to the human resistance, and at one point in the movie, we no longer feel that it's only a movie. Its rawness comes like a near-documentary. Like Coppola himself said ""It's not a movie about Vietnam. It's Vietnam itself"". No doubt, it's the best war movie ever made, and one of the best movies ever."

","This is Francis Ford Coppola's third best movie alongside The Godfather and The Godfather part 2, Coppola shows his artistic view of the tragedy of the Vietnam war.  Coppola brings the story of Captain Willard, who is dillusional of fighting the war, gets a call from the general of the U.S. army to take a very classified mission.  The mission is to kill a highly declarated general(Brando) who has gone mad.  The movie starts off as a vietnam war powerhouse, in which Willard(Sheen) is getting a ride with his troop to Cambodia with a very crazy Robert Duvall who starts a bomb raid on a North Vietnamese village.  Then between the middle of the movie til' the end of the movie it starts getting very disturbing.  The one who really gets you scared is Marlon Brando who gives a very disturbing performance .  The movie is great and it was well done by Francis Ford Coppola.  I give this movie a 7 out of 10."

","I didn't care for Apocalypse Now (1979) when I first saw it. Too anti-American and simple-minded concerning the Vietnamese War, I thought.  Something compelled me to see the re-edited and lengthened version, Apocalypse Now/Redux (2001), however, and I'm very glad I did.<br/><br/>Apocaplyse Now is the story of Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), who we first meet as a tightly wound Army intelligence agent awaiting a new assignment in Saigon in 1968.  He is sent on a mission to find and assassinate a Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who is holed up in a compound upriver just over the Vietnamese border in Cambodia, waging his own war.  It is assumed that Kurtz has gone insane.<br/><br/>Willard takes a small but interesting crew along: Chief (Sam Bottoms), Chef (Frederic Forrest), Lance (a famous California surfer dude), and Clean (Laurence Fishburn).  Battles and boredom beset them, and as they travel the outposts of civilization become less and less civilized, as do they.  Kurtz's domain is the paradoxical archetype of this anarchic hell.<br/><br/>The major plot differences from the original movie include a salacious visit with some Playboy bunnies sent to entertain the troops and a visit to a French plantation, stubbornly holding on to the colonial ways.<br/><br/>The new movie is stunning from a visual and sound aspect. Small segments have been added to bring out the characters more fully. Scenes like the famous helicopter assault on a small village, led by a testosterone fueled Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), still have power but seem more balanced in the overall content of the film.<br/><br/>Despite it's 3-1/2-hour length, I was mesmerized throughout.

","This is, quite simply, one of the finest motion pictures ever. The acting, the atmosphere, the setting, the acting performances. This is truly one of the finest films. Virtually every scene is breathtaking, and portrays the horror and inhumanity of Vietnam extremely well.<br/><br/>I thought Martin Sheen's portrayal was simply perfect. His is a subdued character, almost in a daze most of the time. For whatever reasons, he has virtually become almost a killing machine, and has learned to cope by coldly calculating everything around him. There is a sense of uneasiness about him, though, as you feel this is someone who used to believe in the idealistic notions of being a soldier, and fighting wars, and who has come to understand that his idealistic notions will never be realized. This conflict is played out in the now-famous hotel room scenes near the beginning of the movie. There is a sense of sickness and mental derangement, as he goes through the motions of behaving like a real military officer. You understand, though, that all he is is an assassin. That's all his leaders want him for, and if his damaged psyche and mind allow him to carry out his missions, so be it. Martin Sheen is simply superb in the role. I believe he has been somewhat underrated as an actor, but he has done some fine character work, and he simply shines in this. <br/><br/>This is a coldly dysfunctional military. You wonder who the real madmen are, Colonel Kurtz, or the men who seek his death. This is a theme explored by Captain Willard as he travels up the river. All the while he wonders the same thing, he knows his mission, what is expected of him, is to carry out the assassination of Kurtz. He knows, for all the unfairness of singling out a man of Kurtz's character and ability, Kurtz simply cannot be allowed to carry on. Kurtz is mentally deranged, and there is no hope for his recovery. As long as he is operating freely in a combat zone, he is a serious threat to the military effort, and to military forces, in Vietnam. <br/><br/>The movie leaves you feeling disturbed, and wondering about the men who lived through these circumstances and, eventually, returned to life at home."
"zardoz12","Null","0","0","18 July 2002"," Character Study: Willard and Kurtz (SPOILERS!)
","As the film has been analyzed to death, I'd like to focus on the characters of Willard and Kurtz, specifically their military roles. ""Apocalypse Now"" is not a film about the war most military men were fighting; it is about the secret war of ""covert operations"" that went on from 1958 until Saigon fell in 1975. Willard, though he is dressed as an paratrooper, is in fact a Special Operations Group (SOG) employee. One gets the feeling that he has worked for the Phoenix Program while in SOG...in any case, he worked for the CIA while in uniform, and you get the suspicion that he hasn't been ""real army"" for many years. Kurtz is the same; both men were attracted by the freedom of movement allowed by SOG, the fact that you have the highest security clearance, that you are no longer just a gear in the machine. This freedom allowed Kurtz to build his tribe/army and demonstrate his ""American Viet Cong"" combat philosophy. It didn't work, namely because their was no animating ideology behind it, just ""win the war."" Thus the Colonel had to use Vietnamese aborigines, and adapted his tactics to their style of fighting and social organization. The longer he was away from Saigon, the more tribelike his army became, until we see them in Cambodia. There the transformation is complete. The moral: work with the people, not against them, or worse, use them as puppets."
"RHKLWK","9","0","0","5 July 2002"," Editing Achievement
","Whether or not you like the ""short"" version, you owe it to yourself to see the long version, i.e., ""Apocalpyse Now--Redux,"" to appreciate the amazing editing that went into the film to produce the short version.  It was not only brilliant, it was courageous.  I cannot imagine what was going through Coppola's head when he axed the sumptuous plantation scene, but he did it, and, in the final analysis, the scene WAS superfluous and unnecessary to the story.  The encounter with the USO Playboy Bunnies was also dropped, mercifully so.  <br/><br/>There were other more subtle edits that worked out well.  For example, in the long version, the Sam Bottoms character steals Robert Duvall's character's surf board.  This little bit of mischief, and Duvall's reaction to it, diminish Duvall's stature as the uber warrior, and dilute the impression he has made on us, the viewers.  Both are fully restored in the short version.    <br/><br/>The longer version does explain, however, what happened to little Larry Fishburne.  And the longer version also connects Sam Bottoms' drugged out, zoned out character to the fatalities that occur among the crew before the party reaches Kurtz and his command.  I got to where I despised the Bottoms character.  In the short version, he's just plain old ""Surfer Joe.""<br/><br/>The two versions of this movie have given me a greater understanding of the painstaking process behind editing.  <br/><br/>As for the movie, it is a masterpiece, I think, but with a less than fully satisfactory ending, not unlike the United States' 13-year involvement in Viet Nam.  Maybe that was Coppola's point.     <br/><br/>The short version is not kind to Brando, but the long version restores some luster (but not much) to Brando's reputation.  The long version does help to develop Brando's character (Kurtz), which is needed.  Even so, Kurtz is a murky guy, just like the world he lives in, and I would have to think that they are the deliberate creations of Coppola. <br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" is a superb depiction of war and all of its many ambiguities.  For a much earlier treatment, see Milestone's ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (1930).  Bravo, Mr. Coppola!"

","For years Apocalypse Now has been one of my favorite films of all time. Now I have seen the director's cut.<br/><br/>The original theatrical release is a very good story, well told. The director's cut is a much better story. I must downgrade the original version to 9/10, to make room for my vote of 10/10 for the director's cut.<br/><br/>I think the plantation scene is a bit didactic, and somewhat out of place with the rest of the film, but still very useful in illustrating a particular view of Vietnam from the French standpoint.<br/><br/>The concluding scenes, after Willard meets Kurtz, were very confusing in the original version. In fact, I was under the impression that Willard called in an airstrike after he killed Kurtz; there is no airstrike. The director's cut is far superior.<br/><br/>But I think the best thing about the director's cut is the character development of the PBR crew: the Chief, Chef, Mr Clean, and Lance. In the original, we hear what Willard thought about each crewman, but in the director's cut we can see more clearly for ourselves. In one memorable scene, we get to see that Mr Clean received a military funeral at the plantation.<br/><br/>What I liked in particular was the character of Chief Phillips in the director's cut. There is nothing flashy about him, he is just a good man doing his duty. But he could be a model for all chief petty officers in the Navy, or senior NCO's in any branch. Every other character has visible flaws.<br/><br/>One last thing about the director's cut: it show up more shortcomings in Martin Sheen's acting ability. Although he was in all the scenes at the plantation, and he hears about five different versions of Vietnamese society from five different French colonists, he says little and appears not to be paying attention."

","`Apocalypse Now! Redux' is celebrated as one of the most powerful anti-war manifestos. One of the reasons for its long-term success is, without a doubt, its precocious post-modernism. The Air Cavalry scene, in particular, conveys a message that will become part of the post-modern intellectual credo. Most core Western cultural symbols, old and new, are intrinsically violent, `barbaric.' `Apocalypse Now!' is not only a harbinger of this vision, it takes it to the extreme. In it, even the counterculture, in other contexts celebrated as a `liberating force,' is intertwined with the lethal vines of death. In the new release of the movie the Playboy culture and the untrammeled eroticism of the sixties become central driving forces of the Vietnam war. In Coppola's own words `This is an L.A. war.'  His synopsis of the movie sums it up: `The American War to bring civilization to the ignorant millions' is merely the extension of mercantile colonialism[;] the horror and savagery lie not in the jungle, but in the American culture itself, with its powerless [sic] technology and pop culture.'<br/><br/>Although not very original-the idea goes all the way back to Marx-this vision, combined with a daring cinematography and paranoid atmosphere, made the movie into a landmark cinematic event. At the time (1979) it sent shivers down, for different reasons, obviously, many liberal and conservative spines. When I first saw `Apocalypse Now!, behind the Iron Curtain, I found it an exhilarating visual experience. It gave me a glimpse into, I thought, a new world of meanings. Particularly intriguing was the idea that one can talk about war, usually associated with the `shoot em up' clichés of the `Dirty Dozen'-kind, without using grandiloquent musical scores and images. War can be `modern.' Soldiers can smoke weed and listen to rock-and-roll. The Rolling Stones and the Doors had to shape a war that took place in the middle of the Aquarian era. This could be accurate and honest in its intents, if not in details, I told myself until recently, since we are talking about an expressive work of art. I never gave a lot of thought to how much this really fit the ways of the American military or its war in Vietnam. Up to a point it sounded quite realistic to me that crazy American colonels could be surfing aficionados and that their use of technology would be as reckless as their military machinery would allow them. Why, I could not precisely tell, probably ignorance about the ways of American military would be the best explanation. But, then, I had yet to hear about the Ia Drang battle. The eye openers were the movie `We were solidiers,' released in March, 2002 and the book with the same title.  They recount the 3-day battle of November 16-19, 1965 between units of the same 1st Air Cavalry Division that appears in Coppola's movie and the 33rd, 66th  and 302nd North Vietnamese Army regiments, infiltrated in South Vietnam from Cambodia. The movie, far less esthetically ambitious than `Apocalypse Now!,' is however painstakingly accurate. It helps you understand not only the Vietnam War but where Coppola's `Apocalypse Now!' fails the test of a truly great work of art.<br/><br/>Coppola fails to penetrate to the raw reality of the Vietnam war. This is because he utilizes and refines in his movie derivative material. His characters and icons-human, intellectual and historical-come from a large repository of artistically already transfigured-with a political-radial agenda-materials. The movie draws on journalistic work directly influenced by the counter-culture. Some of them seem lifted directly from the famous, for its partisanship, photo-essay `Vietnam, Inc' by Philip Jones Griffith and prefaced by Noam Chomsky.   The scene in which Kilgore offers water from his canteen to a Viet Cong fighter wounded in the gut, saying `Any man brave enough to fight with his guts strapped on him can drink from my canteen any day,' it's obviously inspired from a similar episode depicted in Griffith's book. There, a young Vietcong, although wounded in the abdomen and keeping his intestines inside with a wash bowl, was taken prisoner only after three days of fight, winning the respect of the American soldiers, who offered him water with approximately the same words used by Kilgore. In another scene, Kilgore is shown flicking `death cards' atop of Vietcong corpses. This is a `creative' reinterpretation of a war folklore theme.  Peter Cowie, the author of the companion book launched with the new version of `Apocalypse Now!,' explains that this is `a slight [sic] perversion of what occurred during the toughest phase of the war.'  The sic refers to the fact that in the real incident, presented in Michael Herr's `Dispatches,'  the Americans are the victims. `Once after an ambush that killed a lot of Americans,' cites Cowie the `Dispatches' passage that inspired Coppola, `the NVA covered the field with copies of a photograph showing yet another young, dead American, and on its flipside a mimeographed message: Your x-ray have just come back from the lab and we think we know what your problem is.'  This is a quite surprising act of `artistic license' since Herr was directly involved in the movie.<br/><br/>In consequence, the themes and people presented in `Apocalypse Now!' spring not from reality but from the meta-reality of the anti-war movement. Nothing betrays more the fundamental shortcoming of `Apocalypse Now!' than Coppola's inability to put in perspective the fact that the officers who lead the American troops in Vietnam were, by and large, the same people who saved America and the world from the Nazi and Japanese totalitarianisms. They had little in common with the sixties and with the counterculture. Their personal cultural style was influenced much more by Gregory  Peck, Henry Fonda and Humphrey Bogard than by Elvis or the Rolling Stones.<br/><br/>Everything I read in `We Were Soldiers' convinced me that, for example, Lt.-Col. William Kilgore is a very distorted representation of reality. He has very little to do with history and everything to do with the `post-colonial' caricature of the Vietnam War. The average battalion commander in the 1st Air Cavalry Division is much more like the author of `We were soldiers' himself, lieutenant general (ret.) Harold (Hal) Moore.<br/><br/>In 1965 a Lieutenant Colonel himself, commander of the 1st battalion, 7th Cavalry, 1 Air Cav. Division, his career and lifestyle do not betray any shadow of frivolity. Originally from Kentucky, father of 5 children in 1965, a West Point graduate, he commanded two companies in the Korean War and had spent many years abroad, in Europe and Asia, before returning to Fort Benning, in Georgia, to join the 1st Air Cav. An accomplished aviator and master parachutist he was a `straight and narrow' soldier, remembered for shaving, and demanding his troops and the occasional war correspondent attached to his unit to shave, too, every day, even when on the frontlines.<br/><br/>Moore's 1st Air Cav. commanding officers were made of the same stuff. Some of them were recruited from the heroes of the `greatest generation:' the battalion and company commanders of Salerno, Normandy and Bastogne. As Moore describes him in his book, the division commander of 1st Air Cav., `Major General Harry W.O. Kinnard, a native Texan [] was West Point, class of 1939, and Airborne qualified in 1942. Kinnard was one of the shooting starts of the 101st Airborne in World War II. He was Brigadier General's Tony McAuliffe's operations officer, G-3, at the Battle of Bastogne in the Bulge, and the man who suggested that General McAuliffe specifically respond to German surrender demand with one historic word: `Nuts!'"

"kyle_c","9","0","0","31 May 2002"," One of the most ambitious epics of all time - ****
","I've always seen there as being two types of movies:  Solid, well written movies that follow most basic fundamentals, and ambitious epics, that take risks and create something that is maybe a little unorthodox. ""Apocalypse Now"" is virtually the epitome of the latter.  It throws away standard narrative rules, and establishes itself as a tour de force of visually achievement.<br/><br/>The plot is interesting, but flawed.  Adapted from Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", it moves the story from 19th century imperialist Africa to Vietnam.  Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is on a mission to ""terminate with extreme prejudice"", a renegade colonel, Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has created an army of natives and holed up somewhere in Cambodia.  Willard is to travel up river to find him.  Along the way, he comes across many encounters that make him realize the insanity and horror of Vietnam.  While it is mostly excellent, the ending is a little unfocused.<br/><br/>Willard is a superbly developed character.  He begins in a paradox - he hates to be in the jungle and he hates to be on leave, trapped in the city. He is simply following orders.  Along the journey, reading about Col. Kurtz, he begins to identify with him.  Every character is acted perfectly, except for Kurtz.  It seems that Brando had little focus about what he wanted his character to be like, and it shows.  Robert Duvall particularly does an excellent job as Lt. Col. Kilgore, who is obsessed with surfing.<br/><br/>The technical achievements of this movie are in its visuals and its atmosphere.  The atmosphere of going up the river, further into a strange, unknown land, is incredible.  As Willard travels into the jungle, he becomes more and more like Kurtz, the setting parallelling his descent into madness. Visually, this movie is one of the greatest of all time.  The entire helicopter raid sequence is perhaps the best fifteen or twenty minutes ever committed to film.  It is indescribable - rather, it must be viewed to appreciate.<br/><br/>This film is rich and complex in its themes.  The insanity of war, and a man's descent into madness are in the forefront.  Willard originally sees the reason to kill Kurtz, but as he encounters the horrors of Vietnam, he begins to more and more understand Kurtz's actions, and almost become him. Obviously, there are also parallels to ""Heart of Darkness"", viewing Vietnam as an imperialistic undertaking by America.<br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" is not a flawless movie.  However, it is an incredible epic, extremely well made, which presents important themes.  It certainly ranks as one of the most influential movies of the latter half of the twentieth century."

The scale is just amazing, aside from all the insanity that went on behind the scenes. All would be digital, and the worse for it, if attempted today. So far as the Redux version goes, it DOES add some information, but most new scenes detract from the pace and the relentlessness of the mission. One doesn't always need to know WHY, or HOW, elements come into play. We can provide that with our own imaginations. Coppola seems to be pandering more to his own ego than to the demands of the plot. Nonetheless, still a 100% must see, even if not a fan of war films - just for the insight into insanity, into the dark side that exists within us all, the dreaded unknown waiting in the precipice.

"csm23","Null","0","0","18 May 2002"," Our very own American sacrificial god
","Toward the end of this epic story, which simply breathes of the acid-laced consciousness of the sixties, one thing in particular caught my eye:  in Colonel Kurtz's private collection of books, he has the Bible on a shelf, while James Frazer's The Golden Bough sits out as having recently been read. Both books deal with death and resurrection.  The Golden Bough, however, is a profound ethnographic study of the subject.  As Frazer put it, `The killing of the god is a necessary step to his revival or resurrection in a better form.  Far from being an extinction of the divine spirit, it is only the beginning of a purer and stronger manifestation of it.' <br/><br/>
Colonel Kurtz is obviously synonymous with the ancient `King of the Wood,' the protector of the Golden Bough, a living incarnation of the tree-spirit, who sends rain and sunshine, made crops to grow, women conceive, and herds multiply.  He is a god.  We hear testimonies of his divinity both from his enemies and his followers.  Which is why this movie is so fascinating.  In this film, Coppola invests the inevitable murder of the god-king with new meaning:  the assassination of Colonel Kurtz is the symbolic sacrifice of the shadow side of the American character, the dark side of America's cheery optimism about making the world safe for democracy, the hidden aggression behind the beautiful rhetoric.  <br/><br/>In many ritual sacrifices, the god-king is actually eaten by his worshippers.  Kurtz obviously understands himself this way, as he tells the Captain, whom Kurtz accepts as his executioner, that he's neither an assassin nor a soldier, but `an errand boy, sent by the grocery clerks to collect a bill.'  As he says this, he strokes his shiny bald head, luminescent against the dark background, oblong and fertile like a giant egg, ready to burst forth with new life.  Kurtz tells the Captain, as he prepares himself for the sacrifice, that he has the right to kill him, but not judge him.  <br/><br/>This film is eminently worth watching now that we are again on the warpath against evil.  It warns us to pay attention, first and foremost, to the evil that lies within ourselves."

","In my long search for a flawless movie I have come across one that is more than flawless. Its just a miracle of filmmaking. Coppolas Masterpiece dosn't concentrate on the terror of inital combat (although it does surround the plot) it concentrates on something deeper than other Vietnam War movies like Platoon. Coppola takes on insanity of soldiers, and takes on a story (Hearts of Darkness which was written some years before Vietnam) and applies to a scenario where insanity runs rabid. Captain Benjamin Willard (Acted to perfection by Martin Sheen) a gifted soldier who has sinned in the past is called upon by his peers to hunt down a decorated officer Col. Walter E. Kurtz ( Another flawless performance by Brando) who has gone completely insane and still is operating in the feild with impressionable young soldiers. The tape recording documented to Willard while in the meeting with his peers of Kurtz talking is enough to bring chills to the viewer. He is orderd to exterminate Kurtz in his hideout in Cambodia. On his journey Williard comes across  seedy characters, and numerous obstacles. The French Plantation Scene (Only available in Redux) which is a very odd scene that adds to mystery, and the horror in the movie itself. Once Williard reaches the end of the journey to find Kurtz he stumbles upon a terrifying scene filled with hanging bodies, departed heads scattered in the dirt, and a terrifying lair where Kurtz hides filled with "" (the smell of Malaria and Nightmares). The beginning, middle, and end are all equally terrifying study of Coppolas study on insanity. In my opinion Williard became insane en route to finding Kurtz, but Coppola never explains it to the viewer in definate. The music is equally as eerie to each scene and brings out the full emotion in the movie, and the dialouge is not to be forgotten. Coppola pays attention to each detail, and while he will always be remembered for his Godfather movies, Apocalypse Now was by far his greatest, and maybe the greatest all time.

They included and were not limited to the replacing of leading man Harvey Keitel with Martin Sheen, problems with Marlon Brando, Sheen's near fatal heart attack, the constant rewriting of John Milius' script, the destruction of sets and the halting of filming after a series of deadly typhoons, monetary problems and of course the belief that Coppola might have been more than a little insane to tackle such a slipstream project. I mean it's not everyday that one attempts to adapt Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" while setting it in the Vietnam war. Apocalypse Now was gearing up to be one the biggest fiascos in the history of cinema. But all doubt was silenced in 1979 when the film was finally released. The pressure and problems made Coppola rise to the occasion. Apocalypse Now is bar none, the single finest motion picture ever made and will probably remain that way for many years to come.<br/><br/>Apocalyse Now is many different films rolled into one. It is first and foremost a war movie, it also falls into the sub category of the Vietnam war movie. Many people (myself included) feel the movie easily qualifies as a horror film as well. I also make the argument that it is also an anthology film as it features several different set pieces (or stories) with the journey up river serving as the linking story. Others see a time travel motif as the further the crew travels up river, the more primitive the surroundings become. By the time they arrive in Kurtz's camp they are a world from the high tech environment of the war and seem to have made a journey to an age past. Others see elements of the beach movie in the scenes with Kilgore and the Air Calvary. Scripter John Milius saw the story as a take on the ""Odyssey,"" with Kilgore as the Cyclops and the Playboy Playmates as the Sirens. Coppola however wanted a more direct take take on ""Heart of Darkness"" and rewrote the script accordingly. See if you can find an early copy of the script to see Milius' vision. It would have made for a different movie and includes scenes cut from the finished print like the stealing of Kilgore's surfboard, the French plantation sequence and the second appearance of the Playboy Playmates.<br/><br/>From top to bottom, Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece with the final thirty minutes or so forming the greatest images ever recorded in the history of cinema. Brando's reading of ""The Hollow Men,"" his explanation of what made him what he is today and Sheen's final appearance before the natives cement the film's claim to being the greatest of all time. I'm amazed that some people don't understand the ending. It's simple, Sheen has killed the native's ""God"" (Brando), therefore he is something greater than God. Note how the natives bow to him and present their weapons to him as he passes. This is emphasised by the use of the same lighting on Sheen that was used on Brando, the partial hiding of his face and so on. Sheen is now the new God of the tribesmen and that is why they don't turn on him, instead they bow down to him.<br/><br/>After this it was all downhill for Coppola. He made one fine and interesting movie in the experimental ""Rumble Fish,"" but all else failed to live up to the promise of Apocalypse and the Godfather's I & II (then again how could one top Apocalypse?). He reached his nadir with the mind bogglingly awful ""Dracula,"" and the nearly as bad ""When Peggy Sue got Married."" It truly is a shame but at least he can rest assured that in 1979 he created the greatest film ever made. That is nothing to be ashamed of.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is now and possibly forever, the greatest movie ever crafted. It will never be topped and probably never equaled. It simply is that good."

I first viewed this film on a PAL (UK) videocassette and although I thought it overall to be brilliant then, I did feel the story was slightly tainted by the ending. The version I saw did not show Willard actually attack Kurtz also the scene with the Water Buffalo being sacrificed by Kurtz' followers was not included.  I have searched high and low and I cannot find any explanation for these edits on the PAL version.  I recently viewed the movie again on a region 1 DVD and the scenes described above were included which I thought was a more fitting ending to a excellent piece of American filmmaking.<br/><br/>If anybody can shed any light on the UK release in question, please contact me on the above Email address."

The sound of copter blades hiding the sad sound of an old hippy jerking off and all at sea. Or in this case the Jungle. He is of course brave and visionary to risk all in order to pursue his dream project and I couldn't do any better in a million years but still.....<br/><br/>When I was at school all the kids were drawing copters and writing ""death from the skies"" which tells you all you need to know about this comic book of a film. Full of self parodic quotable dialogue and pretentious arty flourishes we are subjected to silly scenes such as Martin Sheen emerging from the swamp to lightning flashes, the type that only seem to exist in films and then he runs around to not terribly dramatic effect to some old Doors song. It's meant to be deep or something. Rock and Roll war but filmic bore. All this wouldn't be so offensive if there actually wasn't an interesting story to be told behind all this. But we mustn't talk politics must we? Let's bung on some war paint and deal in abstracts about man the animal and taking orders from the jungle or some other tosh. Self pity pervades this expensive but risible project. Drop tons of bombs on an impoverished people, kill maybe a million and then they want us to say, ""Ahhh, poor Vietnam vets."" It is indeed tragic that so many men were drafted into this violent fiasco but lets get some perspective on the whole thing. The fact that the helicopters used in the making of this film in the Phillipines were called away by another dictator to bomb more poor people aptly illustrates the twisted priorities of film folk.<br/><br/>Another laughable aspect of this loathsome picture was the indulgence's afforded the method actors as shown in the documentary film shot while it was being made. That's it, let's just let Martin Sheen get plastered and watch him find his own personal heart of darkness. It'll be good for the film and yield a different angle to....to....no, on second thoughts it's piffle. And to get to the truth of what really happened in Vietnam let's sit around for two days with an overweight, allegedly fornicating recluse asking him questions like ""why are you in Vietnam?"" He'll have the answers. He's the greatest something or rather ever.

","As you watch Apocalypse Now, you catch a glimpse of the true nature of war, and the darkness of the human soul.  Captain Willard is ordered to kill Colonel Kurtz, because he's gone insane and fighting the war his way.  As Willard ventures up the river, we get closer and closer to the insanity of war.  Colonel Kilgore attacks a village with The Ride of the Valkyries in the name of surfing.   A Playmate review is dropped into the middle of nowhere and sex starved soldiers go crazy.  A routine boat inspection turns into a nightmare and the Do Long Bridge shows the futility of protecting something that looks good on paper.  Once Willard arrives at Kurtz's compound, we begin to question what we've been told.  Is Kurtz insane, or is it the other way around?  Perhaps Kurtz is the only one thinking clearly.  We've seen things that do not fit into what we would think in a war.  A war brings out the insanity in the human soul.  The one pure action throughout this insanity is the sacrifice of the caribou.  Cut together with the termination of Kurtz, we see the meaning of Kurtz's words.   Apocalypse Now is not an easy film to comment on.  It takes time to examine, dissect, and reconstruct the film in order to come to a conclusion on what the film means to each viewer.   A great film from Francis Ford Coppola that keeps getting better, and more challenging with each passing year."

","And metaphorically is how one must approach this movie. Just as imperial European powers confronted their ""hearts of darkness"" deep in the African continent, the United States finally had to confront its own in the jungles of Vietnam. <br/><br/>But if moral judgement was all Coppola had been trying to do, this would be remembered only as a pretty good film. What makes it a great one is that Coppola, following his character Kurtz's advise, does not judge, either the individuals in the film (including Kurtz) or the U.S. as a whole. I do not see this film as an overt condemnation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, just a brilliant look at the ramifications of that involvement. Nor is it an anti-war picture in any blatant way -- the attack on the Vietnamese village led by Kilgore and his choppers can be viewed several ways, depending upon what one's own feelings are. War is glorious, futile, exhilarating, chaotic, and savage all at the same time, and that sequence, the best shot sequence ever put on film, is all of it at once.<br/><br/>Finally, the use of music and sound in the film was incredible! From Wagner and the ""superman-esque"" scene we gradually evolve into a haunting almost new age sound before ending up with, fittingly, ""The End"" by the Doors. Along the way, Coppola builds up the appearance of Kurtz to an almost unbearable level; then Brando's off-beat, off-rhythm performance fits the almost un-earthly landscape Sheen and crew find themselves in.<br/><br/>

"Rajdeep","8","0","0","28 October 1999"," magic realism on cinema!
","Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is a brilliant piece of poetry on celluloid that depicts the utter insanity of war. Often revolting, sometimes rambling, frequently luxuriantly beautiful, at times poetic, this film portrays the horrors of war like no other film in living memory has. With liberal sprinkling of literary allusions, poetry, classical music and haunting rock-n-roll, the film is, without a shade of doubt, a sublime creation by a master of his craft.<br/><br/>I have read multiple reviews which harp on the fact that the film is historically inaccurate, that Coppola was not sure of the ending, and that it is devoid of any one special idea. It is possible that this is so, but surely any attempt at depicting lunacy must necessarily deviate from the normal. The artist is entitled to the liberty of using all possible means - although apparently meaningless to others - to achieve his end. Towards that end, it is clear, even to the casual observer, that this is an intensely personal film that mirrors some of the beliefs and convictions of the film-maker. Coppola could not have made this film sitting in a Hollywod studio - he must have spilled his blood and guts out on location.<br/><br/>Viewers looking to find Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" in the film might be disappointed, and not without reason. The film is only loosely based on that story, and the director has modified the novel to suit his storyline. But that does not take away anything from the languid beauty of the film. As you follow Willard down the river, and witness one act of insanity after another, you realise that for realistic portrayal of horror, this film is an unparalleled achievement. Using the magnificent locales to its advantage (embellished with haunting cinematography - sometimes surreal, sometimes terrifying) this film best incorporates some of the elements of magic realism (as inspired by the works of Freud, Joyce, Dali and Garcia-Marquez).<br/><br/>To expect the same attributes in this film as those which make up some of the other so-called classics, and therefore to use the same established set of parameters to judge it would be a folly. Like all art, it too is often inscrutable and ambiguous, sometimes dubious, and almost always open to interpretations. But sometimes, even life is like that."

","Francis Coppola's famous quote, ""This is not a film ABOUT Vietnam; this film IS Vietnam"", gives revealing insight into the filmmaker's intentions when making his visionary war epic, ""Apocalypse Now"". From that statement it is not difficult to draw parallels between the film and the war it sought to portray:  both were long and costly; both began with a sense of purpose and ended with ambiguous, unsatisfying resolutions; and both displayed a surreality borne out of absurd imposed conditions that made it impossible to secure victory. This absurdity was aptly highlighted by Lt. Colonel Kilgore's self-satisfied statement, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"".  It is not by accident that towards the end of the film, the mad renegade Colonel Kurtz read passages from T.S. Eliot's, ""The Hollow Men"". Without being specific, here a few from the poem:  ""Shape without form, shade without colour...Paralysed force, gesture without motion...Those who have crossed with direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom...Remember us - if at all - not as lost...Violent souls... but only as the hollow men...the stuffed men...In this last of meeting places...We grope together...And avoid speech... Gathered on this beach of the tumid river"" - (""Mistah Kurtz - he dead"" - 1925).

","Marlon Brando is a legend. I loved him in all three movies I've seen that feature him (THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, and of course this one). Brando steals the scene (hell, he steals the entire movie!) near the end, but what exactly was the point of this muddled quagmire that critics for some reason like to call a masterpiece? As I understand it, the movie was filmed even before the final draft of the script was complete. And it shows - the movie is mostly episodic: Willard (Martin Sheen) learns of his assignment to ""terminate"" Kurtz, nuking of Vietnamese villagers, tiger attack, USO girls, trip down the river, and finally the confrontation with Kurtz and his minions. These scenes play a little like short subjects and are weakly linked by Willard's narration. I watched this movie in order to prepare to write an analysis of its content and style and to judge whether it accurately adapted Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness."" The adaptation is only superficial. Conrad's novel was about imperialism and race relations in the jungles of Africa, while APOCALYPSE NOW was about patriotism and desertion in the jungles of Vietnam. Both the novel and the movie do explore the theme of an individual's morality versus that of the ""civilized"" world, but I don't think the theme comes across that way. What exactly made Colonel Kurtz go insane? The horrors of war? Ethical qualms about killing innocent people? Agent Orange? The movie never fully explains the circumstances of his psychosis, though we do see that he has become disillusioned with America's supposedly good intentions in Vietnam. And why must Willard kill him? Sure, Kurtz went AWOL and violated military policy, but was he really a menace? Has he become a martyr to the cause of a greater morality that neither Willard nor anyone else can understand? Once again, the movie never explains that fully. All that aside, the movie is soul-stirring and exhilirating. You can see Coppola's bitter attitude toward the Vietnam War coming out in every scene: the mock glorification of wartime butchery with the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" theme; the incompetence of the U.S. military, the powerful scene where Willard shoots a woman, having to choose between duty and morality - the scenes obviously show that the director had a lot he wanted to say. And then there's Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando with stygian candor. His iron grip on his band of Cambodian guerrillas is intriguing in a frightening way, and I loved the penultimate scene (though I didn't exactly comprehend it), where Willard stabs Kurtz several times while the footage is intercut with the sight of a water buffalo being slaughtered. As the movie ends, Willard and his one surviving partner leave Kurtz's jungle fortress, as Kurtz's last words (""The horror! The horror!"") echo eerily in the distance. Willard has fulfilled his mission, but what has he really accomplished? Is civilization really safe once the Kurtzes of the world are gone? Or is there a greater evil, the one that drove Kurtz insane in the first place? The audience is left to determine this independently. Despite its flaws, the film is memorable and captivating. The jungle imagery is both beautiful and forbidding, and Jim Morrison provides just the right touch by singing various haunting songs throughout the narrative. APOCALYPSE NOW is an excellent movie. I just wish it wasn't so murky (in more ways than one!)."

Darkness, Kurtz, Apocalypse, Willard, are all a part of every man. The oft repeated criticism of the film for its general murkiness, and particularly its vague and disturbing ending miss the point of the film. When Willard finally kills Kurtz, nay, butchers him, as the parallels to the butchery of the water buffalo show, he is no longer, as he says, ""in their army."" He has become a disciple of the mad Colonel, and is now following his orders. He has left the relative sanity of drunken rage in a Saigon hotel room and become a part of the spiralling madness that exists in the jungle of man.<br/><br/>Kurtz' singular genius, Willard finally realizes, is that he - unlike the ""four star clowns"" who run the war - truly understands ""the horror"" in the heart of man, and there is only one escape from that horror. Kurtz's mad scribblings, ""Drop the bomb, exterminate them all"" reveal what he has discovered, that his desire is not merely his own escape from the madness, but the escape of all, the Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>As Willard leaves the temple, he too is worshipped by Kurtz' followers, for he too has seen and understands The Heart of Darkness, and as he escorts the ignorant Lance away, who like most men can only gaze in wonder upon that which he does not understand, Kurtz's last warning is repeated, something which Willard cannot escape in his PT boat, for Willard now truly knows ""the horror, the horror""."

Movies like PLATOON and FULL METAL JACKET are ABOUT the Viet Nam war, and probably more accurately portray it, but this film is more chilling, more disturbing, and more surreal.<br/><br/>The ending is often criticized as well, as being cerebral, confused, inconclusive and murky, but after all the madness that precedes it, what other ending would you want?

And the obstacles faced by Willard on his journey, his nervous breakdown in the beginning of the film is like a battle of the Gods within himself preparing him for the next step of his life's journey, Kilgore (Robert Duvall) is the Cyclopse, the Playboy Bunnies are the Sirens, and the Dolong bridge is like the River Styx, the entrance to Hades, the point of no return, the screams from the fog are the Furies always in chaotic flux voicing their alienation, and Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) is the insane (sane?) collective unconscious of the Gods.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is not only an Epic it is THE Epic of its generation, the WWII Generation had Gone With the Wind, the Rock n'Roll Generation has Apocalypse Now.  The other important Epic of this Generation is the Star Wars Trilogy which fails in its rather conventional views on morality, its too tight, its too clean, the lines are too clearly drawn, what Star Wars gains in scope with its 3 films is lost in its lack of complexity.  The best film of the trilogy The Empire Strikes Back succeeds in being such due to its obvious relation to Greek Tragedy (afterall it does contain one of the greatest reversals in film history).  There is an inherent danger in reducing the inner conflict of good and evil down to something as simple as black vs. white, like the Star Wars films do.  Lets face it, nothing in life is that simple, and the minute we start believing they are is the minute we start coming apart.  Apocalypse Now succeeds precisely because it does come apart, it shows what happens to men in desperate situations and consequently warns us of the dangers of these situations.  By the end of the film we aren't sure who is right and who is wrong.  When Willard kills Kurtz we don't feel a burden lifted, instead we feel uneasy, because we know there is a little Kurtz in all of us.  Any movie that attempts to get an audience to confront these feelings, is no longer just a movie, it transcends to Myth."

","This brilliant war epic is a testament to the turmoil Francis Ford Coppola and his family went through in making this film. Along with Martin Sheen's heart attack, Marlon Brando's ego and Dennis Hopper forgetting his lines, Coppola had to deal with budgeting problems, the weather and the antics of the Phillipines government. The journey which Martin Sheen takes is not only down the river, but a journey within himself. The movie deals with a number of issues and is lifted by the supperb cast. It was a stroke of genius to drop Harvey Keitel as Captain Willard and put Sheen in his place. This is definitely one of the great films of all time.  The film was Beautifully shot and duly one an Academy award for cinematography.The highlight of this was illustrated in the helicopter scene which was set to the tune of Ride of the Valkyries. The most remembable line of the film would have to be ""I Love the smell of Napalm in the morning"" which was uttered by Robert Duvall. Another notable line was said right at the end of the film by Marlon Brando, ""the horror. the horror"". This film is very deep and is best watched late at night in complete darkness for full effect.This film is a long journey into oneself that turns into something that defies belief and stretches the imagination. The movie's ending lets the rest of the story down, but it still is a cinematic masterpiece."

","First of all let's get my beef out of the way.  I know this is a really stupid reason to give a movie only 9.5 out of ten instead of the 10 that it deserves, but Marlon Brando bugs me.  In this movie, he was on screen for no more than fifteen minutes.  He was paid an exhorbitant amount of money and he was nothing but a problem on the set.  He was constantly too high to do his lines by heart, he was so fat and out of shape that Coppola had to do his scenes in a different shade of light just to make him look plausible as a soldier.  His attitude alone put the film over-budget and behind schedule and that bothers me.  When one person thinks he is bigger than the collective whole, it takes away from the experience of watching the film. It was impossible for me to watch Brando on screen and not cringe.  He was a disgrace to acting and to his profession and I am glad that he is no longer around Hollywood.  Having said all that, I will now get to what is good about Apocalypse Now.  And that is everything else.<br/><br/>This is certainly one of the best films ever made and it is so because of how dark it is and how realistic it feels.  Martin Sheen is so brilliant that it is scary.  And of course who can forget Robert Duval's performance. But what makes this film over the top and the classic that it is, is Coppola's attention to detail.  The helicopters flying in the background, the explosions over the horizon, the unseen enemy lurking imminently in the darkness.  This is the first war movie that I had seen that made me think I knew what the horrors of war were really about.  With everything this movie stands for, it is a shame that it lost best director that year and it is really a tragedy that Kramer vs. Kramer beat it out for best picture. What a terrific film."

","This movie has got to be one of the best Vietnam war movies of all-time. It is definitely my favorite.  Although the movie doesn't exactly revolve around the war itself, the story around which it does revolve does show the horrors of the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>The beginning is excellent with Martin Sheen waiting in his room.  He's waiting for a mission and he gets one.  One that'll probably make him lose the taste of having to go on a mission ever again.  He's assigned to take down a crazy American colonel who is called Colonel Kurtz.  He lives on an island isolated from any war activity or any possible American invasion. We do not know whether the other people on the island are being held captive or if they are there by their own will.<br/><br/>On his way to the island, Martin Sheen runs into another  radical colonel played by the always perfect Robert Duvall.  It is during the unfortunately too short scenes with Duvall that we see what the war kind of looked like. A bunch of Vietnamese people living in straw houses and fields being bombed by the Americans.  It is during one of the American Napalm-bombing scene that Robert Duvall says ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning"".<br/><br/>The killing of Colonel Kurtz (beautifully played by Marlon Brando) by Martin Sheen is purely genius for we have the killing scene of Kurtz and the killing scene od a cow by Kurtz's men outside that are in parallel.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully well directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The godfather) and greatly acted by Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, and Robert Duvall.

","Maybe the writers should have never aspired to the level of Conrad as some will say that the ideas of the movie as they are spoken in dialogue sometimes do not come out very clear.  But that fact makes absolutely no difference in this movie because the visuals are filled with so much intensity and mood that it is impossible to miss Coppola's point about war. The episodes are each stunning.  My personal vote for most awesome sequence in any movie ever is the Ride of the Valkeries helicopter attack.  Robert Duvall is genius in his role as an air cavalry colonel who picks his targets based on the quality of the surfing in the area.  He at one extreme fun loving and at the other lacking humanistic qualities altogether.  As absurd as it sounds, you absolutely believe him when he says, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning..."" All the other performances are top notch including a good debut for a young Laurence Fishburne and solid, dark yet sympathetic presence from Martin Sheen (even though he suffered a heart attack during filming).  Once you have experienced the grandness of this surreal war film, I highly recommend renting ""Hearts of Darkness: The Making of Apocalypse Now""  This Oscar winning documentary was shot by Coppola's wife and paints a vivid picture of what an awesome undertaking Apocalypse Now really was."
"jimidom","10","0","0","30 April 1999"," Insanity and Hell on Earth
","APOCALYPSE NOW is not a war movie. Or at least, it's no more a war movie than Joseph Conrad's novel THE HEART OF DARKNESS, from which this movie was adapted, is about British imperialism. Therefore, nitpicking this film's military anachronisms is rather silly. Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is instead a study of man's dark side, where the utilization of primordial instincts can lead to insanity and ultimately Hell on Earth.<br/><br/>
Coppola's take on Conrad's vision of this dark side is absolutely brilliant. The film moves you closer and closer until finally Hell on Earth is ultimately reached, and Satan takes the form of the insane Col. Walter Kurtz, chillingly portrayed by Marlon Brando. Equally brilliant is the transformation of the film's protagonist, Capt. Willard, into a killer who in his own words ""understands a thing or two about Col. Kurtz that he didn't before.""<br/><br/>Martin Sheen's portayal of Capt. Willard is utilitarian, but he does shine, particularly in the scenes with Brando, where Willard is held captive in Kurtz's compound.  Robert Duvall's all-too-brief appearance in the film as the nutty surfer-wannabe Col. Bill Kilgore is without a doubt the film's finest performance, as acknowledged by an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Other notable performances include Frederic Forrest as Chef and Lawrence Fishburne's film debut as Clean. All-in-all, this film was brilliantly acted.<br/><br/>APOCALYPSE NOW is not only one of the few films brave enough to tackle this controversial subject matter, but it also does so better than any other film I have ever seen. Furthermore, the haunting images: Hueys flying through the fire of Napalm Hell, Col. Kurtz lurking in the shadows, and Capt. Willard rising out of the water with machete in hand looking chillingly Kurtz-like,  are the kind that stay with you forever."

When Sheen and his boys find Kurtz and his tribal home, I had trouble believing that the earlier scenes are part of the same movie.  The battle scene at the bridge is by far the most chaotic and disturbing battle scene ever made, and perfectly points out how random and hopeless war is.  I am one of the people who think Marlon Brando's requests and...immature attitude actually benefited his part.  After all the buildup in the movie, would it really make sense to film him in anything other than shadows?  His semi ad-libbed dialog also helped by giving the impression that the Colonel had to struggle to make his thought coherent enough to form a sentence.  Overall this is the most atypical war movies ever and all of it's aspects fit together perfectly."
"Doc-134","10","0","0","5 April 1999"," The Rhetoric of ""Apocalypse Now""
","In the film ""Apocalypse Now"", we follow Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on his mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade Green Beret; Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has set himself up as a God among a local tribe. In a sense, Kurtz has set up his own army within the jungle that resembles that of a tribe. As Willard descends into the jungle he is slowly over taken by the jungle's mesmerizing powers and the battles and insanity which surround him. The further he takes his journey, the more he becomes like the man that he was sent to kill. Kurtz has succumbed to the power of the jungle around him. At one point Willard mentions that ""The jungle is where he really takes his orders from"". Willard can feel himself slipping into the same mode of human existence.<br/><br/>There are echoes of Bahktinian discourse within  ""Apocalypse Now"" in that there are always two forms of rhetoric speaking and opposing one another. The first is the civilized western institution of the miliary. The second is a more primitive, instinctual world, where primal instincts prevail. These two voices seem to be always oppose one another, but when it comes down to the climax of the film, we see that the film has attempted to draw a relation between the two.<br/><br/>The structured, civilized, and supposedly moral institution of the military has given Willard a Â‘simple' assignment to travel up river, find Kurtz and terminate his command ""with extreme prejudice"". These orders laid out in a highly structured manner, which is characteristic of military discourse. Willard soon realizes that the mission really isn't as simple as his commanders attest it to be. In one scene later on Willard says ""I thought I would know exactly what I was going to do when I saw Kurtz, but now I'm not sure"". His journey along the river gives him a certain insight into Kurtz's psyche.<br/><br/>In practice, even the rest of the military that Willard encounters as his escorts up river seems to be undermined by carnivalization, meaning that there is more freedom from restraint than what the military would expectedly allow. We have Sgt, Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who seems more concerned with surfing than with the war they are fighting. He is constantly looking at the tides to determine the plausibility of a good surf, and having his men surf the beach whenever they invaded a village. There is even a scene where they bring in two Playboy bunnies to dance for the sex starved soldiers of Vietnam.  Men also water ski behind the patrol boat, and suntan on deck. This is not something that we would expect to have occurred in Vietnam.<br/><br/>As Willard continues his journey, he still is aware of the mission that he has been sent to accomplish, but he sees more references to primitive and tribal ways, the closer he gets to Kurtz. In one scene, the jungle seems to come alive and attack the boat. Suddenly thousands of spears are hurled at the boat, from no apparent location except for the jungle itself. All we see are the arrows flying out from the brush, we never see anyone throwing them. And arrows in themselves are a symbol of tribal practice.<br/><br/>When Willard meets Kurtz, it is then that the voices of ordered military and primitive, tribal instincts are truly revealed, but Kurtz does not see them as opposing, as such. He suggests that the two may be amalgamated, which is perhaps a sign of his psychoses. In a long monologue, he argues that the military needs men who are moral, but yet at the same time are able to utilize their primordal instincts to kill without feeling, without passion, without judgement. ""...It's judgement that defeats us"". He says that ""if I had ten divisions of those men, our troubles here would be over very quickly"". This is where the two opposing discourses truly meet with one another.<br/><br/> There are multiple ways that one can interpret ""Apocalypse Now"". The film has a huge multiplicity of meaning and what I have said is only one of many ways of viewing it.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

The dark frightening jungle, and the omonous river that snakes through it are amazing, and each scene takes you farther from reality and into a realm of madness.

","This is not only the greatest WAR film of all time, but it is (in MY opinion) the greatest film EVER made.  So monumentally gargantuan in scope, this picture effortlessly handles the taboo topic of the hidden, dark side of mankind.  Each character is a pleasure to watch from Duvall's over-the-top ""Col. Kilgore"", to Brando's broken, life-weary ""Col. Kurtz"". They all demonstrate a facet of humanity that sometimes brutally displays the utter beast that lies deep inside of all of us.  As far as a ""War"" film goes, it is TOTALLY untouchable.  Films like ""Deer Hunter"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""Platoon"" are all great, but fall short of the greatness that ""Apocalypse Now"" has acheived.  ""Full Metal Jacket""'s first half (the Marine training at Parris Island) is stunning and flawless.  Soon after though, it treads into territory that damn near noone can relate to.  Not everyone is a killing machine like ""Joker"".  You may say that noone can relate to ""Kurtz"" but I seriously doubt that given the same circumstances, you would not be questioning the very fabric of humanity the way he does.  In ""Platoon"" we are faced with incredible force, and great story, but muddled dialoge, and a sense of aloofness in our main character leave us at bay.<br/><br/>You would also be hard-pressed to find a motion picture more beautifully filmed than ""Apocalypse Now"".  I've seen the cream of the crop as far as cinematography is concerned, and nothing comes close to Vittorio Stararo's breath-taking view of warfare.  This film is just candy to the eye for those who can appreciate quality filmmaking.  Many say that the film was ""incredible... ...up until Brando came in"".  To be honest, that is when the film came to its hightest point.  This is when the film REALLY challenged your REAL views on mankind.  I'm no pyscho, but I felt as though many of the declarations Col. Kurtz was making on humanity were right on.  Also, Dennis Hopper's eccentric, burnt-out photo journalist is a real treat to witness as slowly, Martin Sheen's ""Cpt. Willard"" realizes he isn't all that different from them.<br/><br/>Coppola declares himself that he didn't care for the ending very much.  It was the ending that will stay in my memory forever.  Talk about true power in cinema, NOW you have it.  I've never seen anything like it.  Even the breath-taking introduction of ""Saving Private Ryan"" can't come close to the ending that Coppola didn't even intend to make.  Amazing.<br/><br/>There are plenty of classic moments in this picture (the helicopter invasion to ""Flight of the Valkiries""; the ""mini May Li massacre"" aboard the PBR; Willard's spiritual darkside in the hotel room at the beginning...) the list goes on and on.  Only in a film this great can people truly see themselves and the dark, remorse-less nature that we embody.  There is nothing that I have ever seen that will come close to this spellbinding movie experience."

Everything in this movie says important things about the insanity in war and how cruel its influence on the involved persons is. Just Willard's inner dialogue tells that he is getting insane about the war. The people who surrounds him, Kilgore and the people on the boat, are all insane, brainwashed by the war and Uncle Sam, and Coppola is showing this desperation in a perfect way.<br/><br/>The adoration of the West is also very important. Kurtz has gathered his own private army and with him as a the leader, all the participators have painted themselves white. As the boat approaches their base, they stand as ghosts, blindly following their white leader.<br/><br/>The editing, acting and directing is as great and beautiful as the movie itself and I can recommend it as the best movie ever.<br/><br/>I hope I have expressed myself well in this comment, because it is extremely difficult to say something good enough about such a movie masterpiece.

"Funkyleg","9","0","0","11 March 1999"," One of the most chilling depictions of the horrors of war and man.
","Apocalypse Now is quite possibly one of thee greatest films ever made, and definitely a masterpiece.  Not only does Coppola depict the horrors of war, he also examines the savagery which is at the heart of all mankind.  Coppola does not show the horrors of war the same way most war movies do.  Saving Private Ryan used gruesome visuals and intense drama.  Platoon attempted to show the interaction between men, and their loss of innocence.  Apocalypse Now is much more creative.  The creative approach is perhaps shown best in Roert Duvall's character, Lt. Col. Kilgore.  Coppola uses the humor of this man who is so obsessed with surfing, he attacks a village primarily so he and his men could surf there.  This was an incredibly creative way to show how a man can become so insane while not becoming detached from relationships with other people. Beyond the depiction of war, Apocalypse Now attempts to show the evil that is at the heart of every man.  This is not necessarily to say that all men are evil, however, it is saying that all men are capable of such evil, and are often attracted to it.  As the men travel further and further down the river in the movie, the things they see become more savage and insane, as well as the crew itself.  So, in essence as they travel further down the river, they travel further into the evil heart of man.  This is the main theme behind the short story which the movie was based on, ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad.  The end of the river is the culmination of all evil.  A display of what man holds inside him and what he is capable of. Apocalypse Now is less of a war movie, and more of a journey into the heart of evil."

","I am not even a Coppola fan. I believe that most of the films he did (including 'Godfather') are laughable. But 'Apocalypse Now' is a work of art, an untouchable piece of film making, that will never lose any of its values.<br/><br/>The story is about two men who discover their weaknesses as well as their strengths in the hellish background of war. Coppola treats his audience with total respect. He doesn't attempt to moralize or even take sides. He leaves the decision to us.<br/><br/>But what is so magnificent about the script is the way it plays with the war element. 'Apocalypse Now' starts as a typical war movie, but then it becomes a film noir type of thriller. Suddenly the war element returns and then you have no idea where this will lead. You are left at the hands of the director, who ultimately takes the audience, exactly were he wanted to take them.<br/><br/>The production is huge. Totally breath taking. At a time were everything is computer generated, the Redux version is here to destroy everything that was released in the last 20 years. Can you handle the power of the explosions? The flares the burst in front of you? The whole reality element is printed on film and is there to prove that nothing can replace authenticity.<br/><br/>Coppola's direction is phenomenal. Dark, slow, captivating and Gothic. This is an absolute work of art, the explosion of Coppola's talent in one film. He could retire right after that movie.<br/><br/>Sheen is great and Brando is simply the best actor of all time. Notice in 'Superman, the Movie' how he says '...this fortress of solitude'. Everyone else would be ridiculed saying something like that, but not Brando.<br/><br/>The Redux version is not another re-release with some unnecessary extra scenes. When you watch the original version, you get the feeling that a lot of aggressive editing took place. The new version is simply amazing, 3 hours of excellence, nothing is redundant, the editing is beautiful, the sound track is perfect.<br/><br/>'Apocalypse Now - Redux' is perhaps the best movie of all time and I haven't said that for any other movie yet.<br/><br/>

Besides that, the acting was great especially Martin Sheen's and the ending was very powerful.  Maybe if I had seen the original version, I might have enjoyed this film a little more.

","I don't have any more right to say anything about this movie than anyone else; I think it lends itself well to interpretation.

I recommend reading it to anyone up for a challenge; it does not flow very quickly, and if you miss one sentence you've missed quite a bit.<br/><br/>Both the book and the movie are extremely affecting, and both can stand as archetypes of their own medium.  Apocalypse Now is one of those movies I can watch about once a year, but never get that tired of it; it flows better than the book, obviously.<br/><br/>You can tell this is a movie that will never be made again, or if it is remade it will be undoubtedly horrible.  How do you describe the plot, other than to say Martin Sheen goes down the river to kill an insane Colonel? But that is too simple, because the movie reaches the psychological red line, where any more would bore a person inconsolably, but too little would make a completely different, hollow movie.  Gladiator has nothing on this film, and yet they're both making messages about combat.  Which one is more realistic? That's not really a fair question given the two movies.  Which one is better?  That is a fair question, and the answer is obvious."

A woman complain due to there's only showing nude women, but in fact the are nude men there (martin sheen in the beginning). The nudity in this films shows emotions and feelings and is bit nessescary. If the scenes had been films with clothes on it would not have been the same.

","This is a monumental motion picture. The movie is about an honest soldier (Kurtz) who understood the very simple truth that war is terrible and that the only way to finish is if soldiers are determined to kill without judgment. Kurtz understood that he had to go the extra mile to perform atrocities, without any fear, for the sake of winning the war quickly.<br/><br/>I suppose the message is strong because the same truth applies to all kinds of jobs. Some people are workaholics because of the same reason. Either you make yourself a friend of horror and moral terror or you allow yourself to be consumed by these forces. All jobs (not only the job of the soldier) are associated with some form of horror and moral terror. The most honest attitude in the madness of war is to stand there in the middle of the jungle and fight all the way until the enemy is exterminated. This is the greatness and the madness as well of Kurtz's realizations. <br/><br/>The movie is superb because it shows how a group of soldiers progressively understand the realizations that Kurtz made.

","Francis Ford Coppola has taken a very good film and turned it into a great one. Adding nearly one hour of footage, Coppola turns up the insanity level, focusing not as much on the political commentary as on the surrealism of both Vietnam and his project. There's a greater emphasis on women this time around and Coppola's approach is surprisingly sympathetic: the USO Playmates have been driven mad by their surroundings (their pathetic sexual encounters take place at a forlorn, muddy outpost in a driving rainstorm) and Aurore Clement appears to the main character, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), as an angel of mercy (in perhaps the most astonishing section, a lengthy visit to a hidden French plantation). The scenes concerning Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) have been fleshed out somewhat but remain ambiguous and calmly ruminative, welcome and almost another movie in itself. Still, it's in the journey that Willard undertakes where most of the value can be found and Coppola's identification with the vivid dreamscapes make this a harrowing personal vision that lingers long after the film is over."

","Sometimes in a good way, and sometimes in a bad way, this movie is WERID! But then again, so wasn't the Vietnam war. I think this movie has one of the best stories when it comes to stories, but not when it comes to Vietnam movies. Director Francis Coppola is quoted saying that this movie isn't about Vietnam, this movie IS Vietnam. Well, I think I must disagree with the great Francis Coppola (I know this is a big risk for me to do, and if you never hear from me again, well, don't bother looking for the story in the papers, because more than likely Mr. Corleone is going to deny it). I must say that this movie at the beginning IS Vietnam, but at the end, begins to lose perspective of being about Vietnam. And yes, I know that it is supposed to take place in Cambodia, but if that's the case, then you can't claim the film to be about Vietnam.<br/><br/>This film begins to go down hill as soon as they start to go up the river to Cambodia in the boat. The whole scene where they stop at the supply depot where they have all the lights set up and where the Playboy bunnies show up in the helicopter. I didn't like that all too much. It just didn't seem right. It seemed too odd and too not true t be in a Vietnam movie. But then again, I wasn't there, and so I can't say whether or not that kind of thing really happened.<br/><br/>But aside from being a non-Vietnam film, this is a very good story film. It has a great beginning, and great middle and a great end. Unfortunately it just lacks factuality. This movie is a lot like what Platoon was soon to be... A fun, but fake movie.<br/><br/>In the end, I gave this movie a 7. It just didn't live up in my mind, to the hype everybody gave it. There really hasn't been one truly outstanding Vietnam movie. Platoon was a piece of crap, Full Metal Jacket was good, but it wasn't true. Another film Hamburger Hill was pretty good, but the acting was atrocious.

","Apocalypse Now /Redux The reissuing of old films, usually called director's cuts, can amount to a bit of bore really, but Francis Ford Coppola's reedited Apocalypse Now does offer some especially interesting additional material to what was already one of the best films ever made. Coppola allegedly went back to original rushes and reedited the film from go to woe. Of course most of Apocalypse Now was and is an absolute classic; an ode to fearless film making. The bulk of this film could not be improved!<br/><br/>This tale tells of Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) traveling by patrol boat up a river in Vietnam during what the Vietnamese called The American War. He's on a mission to assassinate a rogue American master soldier called Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who's assembled a private army of Montagnard tribes people. But what of Kurtz and what of Willard? How crazy are they and what of their environment? Coppola paints of picture of a world gone absolutely mad, or at least the world run by the American military. Normality is careering about, coloured by death, confusion and catastrophe. Some soldiers like Willard get off on the violence and can't function any more away from it. He's only half a step away from insanity. Others like Kurtz become renegades, and seeing too much fall to despair.<br/><br/>Midst this there's the American war, in its latter stages where chaos is foretelling defeat.  A world where a bulletproof cavalry chief (Robert Duvall) forces terrified sailors to go surfing while they are being shelled. A world where the Vietnamese seem to be just targets for helicopter gun ships. So what of this new version of Apocalypse Now? Well it looks terrific with a reworked print which has produced outstanding lush colours.<br/><br/>The sound and music of the original which were always absolutely outstanding have been remastered digitally to make them even more impressive. There is an additional playboy bunny sequence which although suitably strange interrupts the flow of the film. And there's an extended sequence with some French civilians which has some value, particularly their account of the politics behind the Dien Bien Phu battle which saw the French colonial forces ousted in 1954 from Vietnam by the Viet Minh led by Ho Chi Minh. There's additional dialogue on the patrol boat and most importantly extra dialogue for Colonel Kurtz which lifts Brando's previously murky performance in the film considerably.

","""Apocalypse Now"" either in its original version (1979) or the expanded Redux version (2001) is one of the best ever films dealing with the Viet Nam war. The story deals with the trials and tribulations of army Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) who is sent on a secret mission to assassinate a highly decorated army colonel (Marlon Brando) who has reached his breaking point and is causing embarrassment to the U.S. government. To reach his quarry, Willard must sail up a river in a small boat into the forbidden country of Cambodia. The helicopter raid on a small village is a highlight of the journey.<br/><br/> Director Francis Ford Coppula gives us a visually stunning film filled with unforgettable characters. In addition to Sheen (in his best role to date) and Brando, there is a great performance by Robert Duvall as Colonel Kilgore who ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning"", Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest and a teen-aged Laurence Fishburne as the boat crew, Dennis Hopper as a spaced out photo journalist, G. D. Spradlin and a young Harrison Ford as the men who send Willard on his quest and in the Redux version, distinguished French actor Christian Marquand as the owner of the French Plantation. If you blink you'll miss Scott Glenn as Sheen's predecessor.<br/><br/> Speaking of the Redux version, although it adds a couple of extra stops on Willard's journey, it really doesn't improve on an already great film. It adds scenes involving the Playboy playmates, a visit to the French Plantation and an extra scene for Brando. But it doesn't expand on the ending which I still find confusing. For example, how does Willard just walk away from Brando's camp with his supporters (who have performed brutal acts already) staring on with glassy-eyed disinterest, particularly in view of the grisly events that have just taken place.<br/><br/> Still in either version, ""Apocalypse Now"" is a truly great film."

Kurtz, a rogue army Colonel who has abandoned his troops and gone on to be a leader (God, if you will) to a Vietnamese savage tribe.  Willard, travelling with a small crew by boat upriver, sees the massacres of war, and the trials of man.  During the river-ride, Willard becomes obsessed with the man that is Kurtz.<br/><br/>Near the end, while meeting the tribe, and a crazed journalist/photographer(Dennis Hopper) who has become an acolyte to Kurtz (Marlon Brando) attempt to convince Willard (Martin Sheen) not to assassinate Kurtz.  Willard himself does not know what to do.  Watch the movie and find out.  Vividly realistic, fascinating characters, and great direction make this movie a classic.<br/><br/>I give it 8/10 stars."

That should have been left on the cutting room floor as well as the Playboy bunny scene at the camp. However, the DVD version is worth the Rental but I do not know if I would buy it.

You leave the theater staggering, the movie hits you with a flood of impressions that you just can't ignore.

","Apocalypse Now is such a great movie that it's impossible for me to talk about it, it's too beautiful!! So why should I write a comment, you might say? To talk about the differences between the long version and the classic one. Because the classic Apocalypse, the one released in 1979, is not only a masterpiece, but one of the greatest movies of all time, in the same category of ""2001: A Space Odissey"" or ""Taxi Driver"". Instead, the so-called Redux version (197 minutes) is ""only"" a great, amazing movie a bit too long. The added scenes aren't so fundamental to the plot and the structure of the movie, and the soundtrack chosen to accompany them, in particular the scene with the French, is incredibly poorer than the rest of the auditive experience. Only the episode of Kilgore's surfboard adds some enjoyable laugh. Check the brief one, that's the real masterpiece."

","If you get a chance to see any version of this film (but especially Redux) in a cinema then take it. This majestic epic is full of visual wonder that only works properly on the biggest screen possible. In addition, Apocalypse Now has the finest sound of any movie I have seen. There are moments where the troops are talking to each other in a relaxed way, when suddenly WHOOSH a fighter jet enters the cinema in glorious surround. During the action sequences there is not a single shot that does not express the incredible chaos that Willard has found himself in. Brando's performance is astounding, and even in the 200 minute Redux any film fan will remain riveted throughout. Of course there's a lot of bizarre stuff in this film, but nothing approaches the lengthy encounter between Willard and a French woman plantation owner. If anyone can tell me what Coppola was trying to achieve with this bit of soap melodrama, I'd be grateful."

","Francis Ford Coppola was at one time a filmmaking genius.  Now, like many of the 1970s icons, he has devolved into a pale shadow of his former self. With such movies as ""Jack"" and the reprehensible third ""Godfather"" movie, it was merely a matter of time before he went back to material from his glory days, dusted it off, added scenes that had been wisely edited out in the first place, and declared to the world ""I am back!""<br/><br/>Sadly, such is not the case.  The footage added to ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" detract from the movie, stopping its narrative cold (as in the French plantation scene) or changing what was once a brilliant scene into farsical nonsense (as in the added footage that changes Col. Kilgore from a man who is worryingly in love with his work to a simpleton-surfer.)<br/><br/>It is a worrying trend that nowadays directors feel the urge to go back and re-cut, re-master, re-edit, re-do their previous works.  In an Orwellian power trip, it seems that these directors not only want us to forget the shortcomings (if they ever existed) in their prior films, but they also see to it that those who wish to remember are not able to do so by making sure that the ""new and improved"" versions are the only ones available."

","Anyone who sees ""The Making of Apocalypse Now"" will be struck by the difficulties Francis Ford Coppola faced.  Rough environment, actors getting heart attacks, a typhoon destroying the sets, the Philippine army going back to fight the rebels (it was supplying the helicopters for the film, being made in the Philippines).  On and on.  It took forever.  I think that it is safe to say that many people involved in making this flick had a tougher time than, say, Tippi Hedren in making ""The Birds.""<br/><br/>But it was worth it.<br/><br/>The Vietnam War came about within a confluence of elements in the key decade of the 60s.  The U.S. was not just the strongest military power, but the richest country, and with an ever-growing entertainment industry. Intellectual currents, lifestyle currents, openness of spirit.  Peace and love, yes, but also the arts, communications and mass media, broadening horizons.  What movies should be about, how they should be made.  Vietnam contributed to the currents and the legacy of the 60s, but many things would have happened on their own.  In any event, The Vietnam War made us question the morality of itself specifically, and war in general, and whether wars are worth fighting. <br/><br/>Bear in mind something else.  Many war movies had been just straightforward, but there were antiwar ones too.  ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" and ""Paths of Glory"" stood as classic.  As to Vietnam, John Wayne did ""The Green Berets,"" but Oliver Stone comes along later with ""Platoon,"" a basic antiwar flick.   But there was another thing Vietnam contributed in the eye of all the confluences.  That was reductio ad absurdum, a platform for war movies to my knowledge not used much up to that time.<br/><br/>In my college political science class, U.S. Foreign Policy After 1945, the standard northeastern liberal critique, the principal textbook had a chapter on Vietnam called ""The Apotheosis of Containment.""  The supreme example, deification, glorification.  Just to contain communism, in a country like Vietnam, the U.S. did all this?  We spent all that, we dropped all those bombs, we killed and maimed all those people, ruined the land.  And remember, as to our own casualties, there were many other than killed and missing, and the number of killed and died would have been substantially higher if not for modern and technological advances saving people, at least 10,000.  In other words, even if you go back only to the time of WWII,  for sake of comparison, assume many more U.S. deaths in Vietnam, all conditions being equal.   <br/><br/>The Vietnam War was a self-satire.  Bloated and ridiculous.  All in the jungle, in the middle of nowhere.  In the Heart of Darkness.  General Westmoreland asked for 200,000 more troops to follow up the U.S. victory after the Tet offensive, which he characterized as a last-gasp, ""Battle of the Bulge"" effort by the North.  Some other things have come along, such as General Custer being reduced to a racist megalomaniac caricature in ""Little Big Man"" (released during Vietnam).  But Vietnam provides a particular opportunity.  For example, Stanley Kubrick moves from ""Paths of Glory"" to take advantage of this in ""Full Metal Jacket.""   ""Platoon"" contains some elements of satire.  There are others<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola has his ""Apocalypse Now,"" as Joseph Conrad had his ""Heart of Darkness.""  Coppola takes off with a plot involving, well, madness.  But before Colonel Kurtz (Marlin Brando), we have such characters as Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who is obsessed with surfing, in Vietnam.  A blond cowboy, with hat and dark glasses.  Are we in the wrong setting?  Coppola seems to think so as the helicopters rise, ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" plays.  Casual napalm comments.  Actually, approval.<br/><br/>
Martin Sheen plays Captain Willard, assigned to liquidate U.S. operative Kurtz, who is going off the deep end with his private army of locals. Willard and crew journey down a river, passing endless jungle, to Cambodia, where Kurtz is located.   It is well known that The Doors' ""The End"" is used later, but ""End of the Night"" might also have been used for Willard's river journey.  Except the midnight does not turn out to be bright.  Actually, it is here that the question is, ""Driver where're you taking us""?   We are returning to the more primitive, primordial.  Vietnamese in a Sampan are mowed down, save one young girl, except she too is slaughtered when, as is only later realized, she reaches for a puppy.  One of the crew may be killed by a Viet Cong bullet, but a native spear gets the other.  Upon arrival at Kurtz's camp, there are Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine.  Natives meet them in boats, bodies are hanging in trees, and heads are lying around. Bodies confused, memories misused.  Dennis Hopper, by profession a photojournalist, is a jester in Kurtz's court.  Strange Days.<br/><br/>Kurtz is indeed ""lost in a Roman wilderness of pain, and all the children are insane, waiting for the summer rain.""  The blue bus calls.  The Doors could, alternatively to ""The End,"" have come in with the cathartic climax to ""When the Music's Over"":  ""Save us, Jesus, save us...""  Kurtz is the personification of the overall character of the movie, and the war. <br/><br/>
""Apocalypse Now"" has atmosphere, and how.  Dark, depressing, there is violence, and also drugs.  The viewer is engulfed in the negative aura, but this is mixed with surreal elements and very creative cinematography.  Not just the Heart of Darkness, but the Art of Darkness.<br/><br/>Great job by Coppola.  A masterpiece."
"shaid","9","0","0","23 November 2001"," Impressive & powerful after all these years
","*May Contain Spoilers*  *May Contain Spoilers*<br/><br/>This year see the re-release of one of all time classic, Apocalypse Now. The film Francis Ford Coppola directed in 1979 and has received the Palm D'Or in Cannes the same year. The film which is loosely based on Joseph Conrad's novel:Heart of Darkness, has been digitally re-mastered, had an extra 50 minutes added to it and at length of 195 minutes is worth every minute and every effort to see it. With some striking images and a story which takes it time to fold the movie remains as powerful as it was 22 years ago.<br/><br/>Some of the movie's power lies in the fact that Coppola wasn't afraid to show what he think about the war in Vietnam. You can guess that he was not in favor of it and he also show the effect it had on the simple  soldiers that have to fight in an impossible situation. The story follows Cap. Willard (Martin Sheen) in his mission to find a execute one Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who according to the army's chiefs has gone astray, building his own army and not following orders any more. While the story centered on this premise, one should take note to the character of Lance B. Johnson (Sam Bottoms) because he seems to represent America. Lance is America, America is Lance. His image of the clean all American boy in the beginning of the film, is the image of America when it got involved in the war. His image at the end of the film is how America ended this war, spirit broken, confused and wounded.<br/><br/>As for the extra 50 minutes there are 2 important extra sequences each one serve for another purpose. Of the 2, the one which involve Willard's encounter with the French is one of importance because it gives the historical context to the war which was missing from the original version. It also show that The American seems to make the same mistakes(USA has created the Vietcong and now fighting it) all over again.<br/><br/>Since it first release, I have watched this film more than once and every time I have found a new angle to look at it a new thing I haven't notice before. And yet though I think that it is film everyone should see, and more than once will be better, I do not think that this is a film with no flaws. The whole last part, which takes place in Col. Kurtz' camp remains a little un-clear. At the end of the movie I didn't feel that I know about Kurtz more than I knew about him in the beginning of the film, nor did I have more knowledge to his motives and action. The ending is open to interpretation and my guess about it is as good anyone else guess.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is a must see movie. Relevant today as it was 22 years ago. The combination of all the elements (excellent photography by Vittorio Storaro) makes a film which is still disturbing and powerful after all these years."

","I won't add to the accolades already given this movie; it's one of the great movies and one of the few to be rightfully regarded as a masterpiece of the medium.  I just saw the _Redux_ version in theaters, and it held up even with the basically superfluous footage.<br/><br/>A note about _Redux_: the added scenes should have been relegated to a ""bonus materials"" section of a home video/DVD release.  For THAT purpose, it's worth seeing and having and should be included that way in future video/DVD released, but it's almost all inessential to the movie, sidetracking the story and getting boiled down in lots of things that blow certain aspects of the film out of proportion (particularly but limited to Kilgore's obsession with surfing).  One new scene has Fishburne going on for a few minutes in the nature of everyday banter about something I can't even remember, as it had virtually no discernable point or function to play in the plot.<br/><br/>Coppola was in his right mind as director 20 years ago, knowing what to leave out, and using them as bonus material on DVD would give the viewers a good way of knowing just WHY they were eventually deleted from the original. I'm unsure whether to buy the original version on DVD now, or wait with hopes that a future-released version would do it right by including the new scenes but at least giving the viewer the option to view the film in its original form -- either by putting it in a bonus section or containing both versions.  One thing's for sure: I'll just buy the original-version DVD even on secondary market if a future-release version doesn't do it right.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way -- this movie is good.  A Must See.

"Dignan_Tenenbaum","Null","0","0","24 October 2001"," Review of Redux
","Like many of the reviewers for the Redux version, I will start by saying that Apocalypse Now is one of my favorite films of all time.  However, Apocalypse Now Redux belongs in the lower portions of the rankings along with The Matrix and Twister.  Well, maybe not that bad, but it really upsets me to see a great film ruined.<br/><br/>I'm normally the first person to defend a director's right to do with a film what he or she pleases.  But in this case, I feel that Coppola has, since going through the hell that was directing this film, become a completely different director who makes nothing but terrible movies like Jack and Godfather Part III.  Therefore, he shouldn't have been allowed to go anywhere near this film again.  This restriction would have been out of fear that he would do exactly what he did.  He reduced one of the greatest pieces of pure cinema into a summer blockbuster, action, buddy, popcorn movie.<br/><br/>Think about the first time you ever saw Apocalypse Now.  Think about the sense of wonder that washed over you as you followed Willard down the river into the unknown.  Getting to the point where you knew you had to simply accept all the things that were happening around you was the point of the entire first two thirds of the film.  It was after that point, that you are brought to realize that you must do something.  You must try your hardest to affect the outside world that you seem to have cut yourself off from.  This was (and still is) a brilliant film.<br/><br/>Now imagine if that huge flow of precious emotion that you were feeling the entire time was reduced to a feel good movie about a bunch of guys on a boat going to kill some one.  Imagine plenty of things blowing up real good. Imagine Kilgore turning into a whiny freak who just wants his surfboard back.  Imagine Willard developing a sense of friendship with the rest of the guys on the boat.  Imagine a slapstick moment of gratuitous sex.  In your worst nightmare, you can not imagine how low Redux sunk compared to the original.<br/><br/>The first major change that shows up is the assault on the village with Kilgore.  I have to admit that I thought it looked much better.  It seemed to be a little easier to get a hold of.  However, I didn't realize that the rest of the movie would be just that.  Apocalypse Now was a film that begged to be seen several times.  It was hard to follow, not because of poor writing or editing, but because that's the nature of war and becoming a killer.  Redux is as straightforward as movies get.  It's up there with the original theatrical release of Blade Runner.  Redux takes the stance of ""We need to spell everything out for people so they don't feel confused.""  If some one watches a movie and hates it based solely on the fact that it's hard to follow at first, you shouldn't want them as an audience.<br/><br/>It's time for people who enjoy films to start demanding good films.  Why do we have to reduce everything to the lowest common denominator in the audience.  Sure, we can let stupid people have their movies like Armageddon, Tomb Raider, and The Animal.  But don't turn a great film into dumbed down trite.  You always hear about studios retooling movies so as to make them more marketable.  I understand that studios have to make money, so let Julia Roberts and Adam Sandler churn out movies for stupid people and use those profits to make ten good films that you won't mess with.<br/><br/>ps. The French Plantation scene was actually a pretty nice addition."
"Neal Wruck","10","0","0","3 October 2001"," One of the ten best movies ever made (Some spoilers)
","Recently, I had the privilege of viewing the new directors cut of Apocalypse Now known as 'Redux'. It is simply a spectacular restoration of a movie that already was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Almost an hour worth of new footage has been added in. The original always had the sense of being hurried. This new version gives the film more breathing space and develops characters more. They cover a second encounter with the gunboat crew and the Playboy Bunnies seen previously at the U.S.O show and A much-talked about seen at a French Plantation. There is also additional footage of the Air Cavalry and some more footage from the Kurtz Compound.<br/><br/>The best of the new footage is the added footage of the Air Cavalry and of Willard's Gunboat crew. The original cut never really explains why Captain Willard and his men leave after the attack on Charlie's Point so quickly; we assume it's to continue with their mission. 'Redux' explains why. I am not going to tell but this new footage shows more of the insanity of Colonel Kilgore and shows that Captain Willard is not the stone-faced, boring guy we assumed he was (He actually smiles!).<br/><br/>But this is no ordinary Director's Cut, which basically throws in new footage and does nothing else. Francis Ford Coppola and Walter Murch (One of the original editors) have remade 'Redux' literally from scratch. The `new' footage has been restored to match with the original. In addition, Coppola and Murch might have changed some of the existing footage. What I mean is that they have not changed the scene itself, but the camera angle where it was filmed. For example, when Willard kills Kurtz, first off Kurtz is reading an Air Force statement that is banning crewman from putting the F-Word on their planes. In the original, when he was killed, it only showed a forward view of him as he was stabbed. In this version, Kurtz turns around before he is attacked and then shows a struggle between Kurtz and Willard, leading to Kurtz's eventual death.<br/><br/>But even 'Redux' has its flaws. The encounter with the Playboy Bunnies, while harmless, doesn't really have anything to do with the film. It basically shows that people might get desperate enough in wartime to have sex in exchange for fuel. But the French Plantation is not as easy to sit through. Except for showing what the French think of American involvement in Vietnam (Negative of course) and more personality development for Captain Willard (He smokes opium and even has an attraction for a French woman), it has nothing to do with the film's plot. Some call this a trip through time and indeed it has an eerie feeling throughout (Largely because there is fog everywhere). However, I recently found an explanation for the plantation scene that makes sense; the whole journey up the river by Willard and the boat crew is a trip through time. They start off in the Vietnam War, then go to when Vietnam was a French Colony and then go to when it was ruled by savages. Also notice that before they arrive at the Plantation and after they leave it, there is a thick fog (A possible time warp?). However, the movie overall would not have suffered if this scene was left out and instead used as a DVD extra.<br/><br/>Overall, while deliberately paced and a bit tedious (Plus it has graphic violence and many uses of four letter words), Redux proves to be as good if not better that the original. I wonder if it can be eligible for Oscar contendership. I doubt any of other movies this year would be much competition. For me, watching this movie was an unforgettable experience that cannot be summed up in words. If you don't believe me, see it for yourself!"

","Words could not adequately describe the power of experiencing Apocalypse Now Redux screened in 70mm on the gigantic screen at Jordon Commons in Sandy, Utah with the audience who drove tens of miles to attend - young and old alike. Awe-inspiring, mind-blowing, astonishing.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now Redux is a vast improvement upon the original, albeit with a radically different political viewpoint. I consider myself a fan of the original (as the owner of the 1991 reissue laserdisc), but I was stunned by the ""restored"" version. There are footages that are legendary for being missing from the original, most famously the French plantation sequence (which, before the re-release, could only be seen in the making-of documentary Hearts of Darkness). The wait is worth 22 years for the re-release. Francis Ford Coppola commissioned his last great film in the restored, expanded and remastered version because the viewers of Apocalypse Now 5-hour bootleg video wrote the letters requesting restoration. The result is Mr. Coppola giving back to the cinema fans as a compliment. Without film lovers' enthusiastic support, the re-edited and restored re-release wouldn't be possible and the lost footages would stay missing in the vault. <br/><br/>The film exemplifies the madness of war and violence. Francis said regarding the underlying metaphor of war and insanity in the film at a press conference at Cannes 1979: ""It is NOT about Vietnam War. It IS Vietnam War"". That's well said by watching the horror of the war and madness in Apocalypse Now Redux and Terrence Malick's (equally flawed as the original theatrical cut of Apocalypse Now) World War II film The Thin Red Line.<br/><br/>It's worth the time and energy watching the 3 1/4 hour film. Apocalypse Now Redux is quite possibly one of the greatest films ever made, but that's my opinion. I hope the film gets nominated again for the Oscars.<br/><br/>I give my gratitude to Francis Ford Coppola, Bob Weinstein and the Redux restoration crew for the masterpiece that will remain undelible in the epic proportion of vision, sound and politics in the history of film for years."

","As a huge fan of Apocalypse Now in its original state, I was excited to hear that it was being re-released in theaters with additional footage. I hurried to my local theater, watched the film with great anticipation, and I was disappointed. While it was nice to see this great film on the big screen once again, the additional footage really speaks worlds for the editing process. Redux is a totally different film from the original. I admit, I was hoping the new footage would give us more of a look inside Kurtz's compound. There was some of that, but most of it was burned up with a visit to a French villa and time with the Playmates. And, strikingly, Willard becomes far too human. As it was originally released, Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest films of all time, a stunning commentary on man's need to dominate and control man, a psychological study of Kurtz and Willard, and a bit of anti-war sentiment tossed in as an aside. Redux, however, dilutes the primary messages of the original and becomes more of a ""horrors of war"" film, focusing on the war's impact on people of all types. Fans of Apocalypse Now who've never seen it on the big screen should see Redux just for the experience. As I was watching the film, though, I have to say that I was amazed by the artistry that knew that the deleted scenes should, indeed, have been deleted."

","""Apocolypse Now"" is by far the best war film ever directed. It has amazingly creepy sequences of emotional tension, eerily real fight sequences, amazing photography, interesting chracters and a huge budget. Several lesser war films were made around the time ""Apocolypse Now"" came out. These include, ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Platoon"", and the much overrated ""Deer Hunter"". None of these film manage to meet the entire content of ""Apocolypse Now"". The plot for ""Apocolypse Now"" deals with the plight of a single, Sgt. Willard, portrayed exceptionally well by Martin Sheen. He manages to become his character, leaving behind all traces of acting. Willard is sent on a mission up river to stop a mad General Kurtz(Marlon Brando) who has taken matters of winning the war(Nam') into his own hands. Sheen's gradual descent into madness is shown through a series of increasingly ""insane"" scenes involving anything from a Helicopter raid to a USO show starring the Playbor Bunnies. This film also has plenty of cameos from anyone to RObert Duvall to Harrission Ford. What really makes this film what it is, is it's amazing directing by Francis Ford Coppola. Never before (and probably never again) will a move drip so much more atmosphere. TO many, this film is seen as confusing and fragmented. This is undertsandable due to the fact that over 18 hours of footage were filmed in all. Also, Coppala was illustrating a descent into madness, so fragmentation seems natural. Overall ""Apocolypse Now"" is the most original, uncliched, well acted and well-direted War Film ever. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a film with a superb cast, strange storyline or just a plain war film. Stay away from the overrated ""Deer Hunter"" and the inferior ""Platoon"". WATCH THIS MOVIE!"

","Just saw Coppola's new cut.  On a huge screen with all the bells & whistles, the film's stunning visuals are only enhanced.  It is a remarkable experience because you feel in the middle of it all with Capt. Willard and the young guys going upriver.  (This is NOT always a good thing!  It's almost overwhelming.) The dinner scene at the French plantation doesn't add much even as an explanation of the War.  The Playboy vignette, while not seeming exploitive, just doesn't seem to work.  But it was worth seeing the film for the first time in years.  It is such a tremendous tribute to the power of cinema.  It only makes all the drek up on the screen look all the worse.  Yeah Coppola!!!"
"hank65","Null","0","0","5 September 2001"," REDUX: better *AND* worse, and a Phantom Edit might be perfect
","Well, I have finally seen the ""Redux"" version, and it was interesting.<br/><br/>The original cut of the film survives in the memory as a great failure, filled with searing images and sequences, but with NO cohesion between the set-pieces, and leading up the river to the Waterloo of Coppolla's artistry, the Kurtz sequence, which never worked for a minute, then or now. And, if anything, the film was overlong. If you were to ask me for a list of films that emphatically did NOT need to be any longer, ""Apocalypse Now"" would be at the very top. <br/><br/>But what was particularly interesting at the time was that lack of cohesiveness in the first half of the movie. Coppolla had made his name in his earlier films from his ability to sketch in characters economically and well, and that was completely missing here. You gained no feeling for Willard or the characters on the boat, and it didn't flow, it jerked from image to scene to whatever, each piece in itself memorable, but not building any dramatic arc or impression.<br/><br/>Well, ""Redux"" changes that. With some small additions and re-structuring, the first half to two-thirds of this really are the great movie Coppolla so desperately wanted it to be, which feels and moves infinitely better than its original cut. The feeling of traveling up the river to a more grimly primordial world is palpable, and almost wholly lacking earlier.<br/><br/>For example, the stealing of Kilgore's surfboard gives a greater sense of Willard's character, because it's a reaction to Kilgore. In the original cut, it's all passive. You never see Willard reacting to what he's experiencing, he just observes, and the portentous narration tells us what he's thinking.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's still a grand failure. The film skids to a stop in the famous French plantation scene, and the utter dramatic failure of Brando as Kurtz makes the end of this cut as unmoving, embarrassing, and boring now as it was 20 years ago. The tremendous improvement of the first two acts of the film throw into high relief how badly the last act doesn't work.<br/><br/>I suspect Coppolla knows this, in his heart. He did lots of subtle restructuring and re-editing of the first two-thirds of the film, but virtually none in the last third. There, he just threw in the French plantation scene and an extra scene with Kurtz, and called it good.<br/><br/>Maybe what we need is a Phantom Edit version. Maybe Willard should get up the river to a vast anti-climax, with Kurtz already dead (""Mistah Kurtz, he dead""), and nothing to show for the journey. That would leave a version of the film with the good bits kept and the bad bits discarded, and an ending that would work, as opposed to the one it's got, which still doesn't, and which detracts from the parts that are worthwhile."
"votarus4","Null","0","0","5 September 2001"," REDUX: The Law of the Jungle; the God of War
","APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX has grown exponentially in substance and theme from its prior incarnation.  (Possible spoilers....)  If films like Platoon, Deerhunter and Full Metal Jacket appear a bit shallow in the wake of Redux, perhaps it's because Coppola's vision now transcends the Viet Nam debacle entirely, and is more concerned with the very meaning of War, like Homer's Illiad/Odyssey; and the tangible pathway to Hell, like Dante's Inferno.  The Apocalypse difference being that the river Styx IS the journey (where Dante merely crosses over; where Homer crosses an ocean into battle, then strands the homeward Odysseus for 10 years).  The presence of women and sex in Redux is a dramatic literary shift from Apocalypse's prior version.  Where the primary mission had a near-perfect trajectory to the Kurtz malignancy, Playboy Bunnies, once a sideshow, now become mainstage Sirens.  The lure of Sex becomes a palpable reminder of mortality, and the constant presence of Death.  As the Frenchwoman (Aurore Clement) says, men have split themselves in two--living life paradoxically, as both warrior and lover.  This is not without consequences.  Unlike Homer's Odysseus, Martin Sheen's Willard is completely in control, not swayed by temptations of the journey.  Or is he? Circe and the Sirens may be momentary distractions, but what exactly is waiting for him upriver?  The new French Plantation scene offers an important demonstration of just how far 20th Century imperialism, colonialism and political/military misadventuring can go.  It also adds an explicit, intellectual indictment, missing from version one, that can be summed up in a single line:  ""There was no such thing as the Viet Cong before Americans were here!""  But back to the River...  The journey now is longer, and Brando-Kurtz's presence looms larger than ever.  So large in fact, once we get there, Kurtz's meticulous animal logic threatens to swallow Willard's mission whole.  But Kurtz, having found the Law of the Jungle, having become the God of War, realizes he must pay the price of realizing such an elemental ambition.  He toys with Willard; a fatal, intentional mistake.  Willard completes the mission, stands on the temple's platform and wavers (feels much longer in Redux(?)).  Time stops as a thousand people bow to their knees; and herein lies the dark heart of the film.  Does Willard drop the machete, walk down the steps, go on playing soldier, or does he turn around, walk inside, and play God?"

","The shorter version is better. The French plantation is ridiculously, jarringly out of place, and the ""love"" scene there is as gratuitous as something out of ""Pearl Harbor"". The extra Bunny scenes, the Slapstick Fighting scenes, none of these belong in this movie. Most of the added scenes have a lower artistic quality to them, like things just weren't clicking on the days they were shot.<br/><br/>The original was completed in a hurry. For a movie with a magical quality like Apocalypse Now, maybe it was better not to have too much time to think about things. Maybe being under pressure helped them to capture a purer artistic vision.<br/><br/>However, there were many clips added which did enhance the movie and were of high artistic quality. Even in some of the added parts which I didn't like, there were some mystically beautiful scenes. And it's true, the added parts filled out the characters, especially Captain Willard. The extra scenes of L.T. Kilgore were enjoyable.<br/><br/>One thing that was taken out but should have been lift in - the air strike ending with Jimi Hendrix' Woodstock version of the national anthem. It tied in nicely with Kurtz' comment ""Drop the bomb, exterminate them all!"" scrawled on one of his reports, and with some of Dennis Hopper's comments about The Man and His Children. A fiery ending is so much more satisfying in these circumstances."

If you're blind, you should at least give it a three for lines like ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning."" and so many others I can't recall.At one point, Capt.

","I give this version an 8 out of 10,  original version 8 out of 10 also.<br/><br/>The redux didn't change my reaction to the film,  which I have seen probably 10 times.  The most significant change is added depth to Martin Sheen's character, Capt. Willard.  He gets to have some fun and shows compassion for his crew.  Most of the additions lighten up parts of the film with humour and transgressions from the main focus of the plot.  The most fascinating aspect of this re-release is the vivid colours and excellent sound.  All previous big screen viewings of this film I have seen in the past have been scratched old prints played in a theatre with inferior sound.  This new print was made with the mostly defunct Technicolor process (now called Technovision).  The yellows and reds jump out with searing intensity, (there are really no blues in the film).  Combined with a booming soundtrack, this is a feast for the senses.    There is additional material where Kilgore's pre-occupation with surfing is accentuated, including a funny gag where Willard steals Col. Kilgore's surfboard.  Later, helicopters are hunting for Willard and crew,  with loudspeakers blaring Kilgore's voice, `Return my surfboard'.   The next major addition is the boat arriving at a decimated post up the river,  where the Playboy girls are stranded.  This gives Coppola a chance to infuse sex into the film,  as part of his plan to include all the required Hollywood Blockbuster elements.   By far the longest and worst addition is the `French plantation' sequence.  It feels like a reel from `Indochine' or something was accidentally thrown into a film.   It consists mainly of a bunch of French guys arguing about some philosophies that you can't understand.  The audience feels like Willard does on-screen;  bewildered, tired, and wishing you could leave.  But no, a French women has been making eyes at Willard,  and drags him into her bedroom.  More gratuitous nudity.  You almost forget what movie you're in, except that you can see the river outside the window.  Oh yeah,  the boat, Col. Kurtz, the mission.   The few additions of Kurtz don't change your opinion of him,  but they don't hurt the film.<br/><br/>When this version comes out on DVD,  use the power of the remote to skip the French scenes.  Otherwise,  this epic has grown well,  and the aficionados will have a chance to appreciate the lost scenes, for better or worse."

","With the restored version of Apocalypse Now:Redux now being reissued back into theatres,this was in my opinion the last great piece of American cimema in existence today. However, Francis Ford Coppula's Vietnam-set adaption of Joesph Conrad's novel ""Heart of Darkness"" returns bearing nearly 50 minutes that was unseen in the original 1979 version. Though Coppula has called this version of it definitive because it is more accurately seen as a very interesting alternate version that lacks the sharp asthetic focus of the superior earlier cut(although its original running time was at 153 mins,this one is more outgoing at over three hours in length). Among the newly seen sequences which include the fascinating 25 minute ""French Plantation scene"" seems to radiate the right-wing views of primary screenwriter John Milius. Whatever you make of these and other revelations about what you may think about it,the film itself remains a one-of-a-kind marvel that's easily impressive today as it was two decades ago. Aside from the narcissism of Marlon Brando's climax-destroying performance, Coppula was blessed in having collaborators as brilliant as cimematopgrapher Vittorio Storaro,production designer Dean Tavoularis, sound designer Walter Murch,along with actors Martin Sheen,Harrison Ford,Fredrick Forrest, Robert Duvall,Lawrence Fishburne,and Dennis Hopper as well as Sam Bottoms.

Thanks to Steven Spielberg with his Special edition Close Encounters... Thanks to Ridley Scott's Director's Cut of Bladerunner or others... And now Francis Ford Coppola gives us Apocalypse Now Redux. At least Coppola is frank about needing the money for his aptly titled Megalopolis project. His re-release of ANR is transparent and his sincerity (he is always sincere in what he does) is above reproach. What is more objectionable is George Lucas' craven quest to improve his personal fortune and power. Mixing CGI to traditional fx techniques in the Star Wars movies and re-shooting scenes reduces their historic importance to naught. To add insult to injury, Lucas promised to make the original Star Wars movies available for movie goers forever alongside the new edition prints. Last year he re-released all three films + the Phantom Menace in a special package without aknowledging that these were in fact the bastardized CGI-ed prints.<br/><br/>Here Coppola uses only the materials he had access to in 1978, which is a sort of integrity, I guess.<br/><br/>By putting back most of the Willard voice overs and intros to scenes, REDUX loses the disorienting surrealism of the original version. This version becomes far more the traditional war movie with an obvious narrative structure, recurring characters, etc. We are no longer just dropped into the middle of the crazy jungle. Every major sequence is set up carefully in the expanded dialogue, with character motivations becoming clear. The obscurity of the original set it appart in the cannon of the genre as a weird psychedelic trip through war. It's 2001 counterpart, however, has the virtue of humanizing all of its characters and making the viewer care about the fate of each one.

It basically gives us a more towering introduction to Kilgore's character, his surfing antics gone awry, the mission boat's passengers meeting up with the Playboy bunnies later on down the river when their helicopter runs out of fuel and a scene of war politics discussed at a French plantation where Willard and his men land.  Little extra pieces appear at other points as well and 'Apocalypse Now', the most surreal film about Vietnam ever made, shows that with the problems that plagued its production, it probably turned out better since the people involved in the production went through hell, just as the men who fought there did.

It cost $10 but boy was it worth it. The additional footage was a treat.  I now feel like I've seen a complete movie and for the first time it made sense to me.  I actually got the gist of what Kurtz was about and why they wanted him terminated.  I also got to know the boat crew better.  In particular Chef.  Frederic Forrest gave a great performance and much more of it was here.  I've read that Coppola and Murch didn't just drop in the additional footage, that they re-edited the entire film and I can believe it. Almost every scene looked different to me, sometimes slightly but palpably so.  I kept seeing things that I hadn't recalled seeing and found a rich and strange texture that I had never experienced before.  Far from making the film messier, the additional footage made the film tighter for me, as I could really appreciate the orchestration of themes not to mention the sheer orchestration of materials to carry out the big set pieces (like Kilgore's raid).  Also, seeing it on a big screen definitely helped.  Especially in those parts where the added detail let you see pertinent details.  For instance when Willard is reading Kurtz's dossier you can actually comprehend glimpses of the text and it's all very important (there's a reference in Kurtz's CV to his writing a thesis on the Philippines Insurrection -- a precursor to Vietnam).  Even when Willard is reading Kurtz's manuscript at the end you could tell there was stuff in there that was actually relevant.  It would be great if all those texts were presented on the DVD.  All in all, I was immensely impressed.  I watched a re-run of the Basinger series on American Film where they covered the war picture and it was very pro Platoon and anti Apocalypse Now.  They even had a clip of Stone lambasting Coppola for his mythologizing artiness (boy, talk about the pot calling the kettle black).  But I think the consensus now is that AN has stood up better than Platoon, because of it's more overarching approach.  It's a bigger picture with a bigger vision, one that surpasses historical specificity.  The film has taken on mythical proportions and will remain a monument of cinematic dreaming."

So it was certainly a joy seeing one of the most beautifully photographed color films ever made in a theater... Vittorio Storaro is simply a miracle worker.

Obviously any film buff must jump at the chance to see the film in a theater during this re-release...  but it's an awful shame that the version is the ""Redux"" rather than the original.

The majority of the new scenes are superfluous.  While a few scenes still contain the perfectly poetic combination of visuals and sound that is the film's finest asset, others are interesting only for those who have already seen the film but it kills the pacing for those who have not, and others still are simply bad scenes.  Coppola, who was a much better director in the 1970's than he is today, should have trusted his initial instincts.  I don't think any of the new scenes improved the film, while many really hurt it.  (Spoilers from now on!!) The best of the new scenes are near the end with Brando's Kurtz having more screen time.  Still, these new scenes deflate the enigmatic nature of the character.  In the original Brando was always shot in shadow so we are left with a feeling that Kurtz is a projection of Willard's deepening madness.  In ""Redux"" Kurtz appears fully lit and he becomes a more distinct character, and I don't think this is an improvement.  There is also a scene on a French plantation which features a lengthy discussion of the politics of The Vietnam War.  While it may be of interest to some for historical value, it is certainly a failure for it's dramatic value.  Personally I'd be more interested in hearing about the Vietnamese point of view than the French point of view, something that the film never attempts to capture.  This is followed by easily the worst of the new scenes, a romantic encounter between Willard and a woman on the plantation.  It was a forced, bizarrely inappropriate scene that was scored by the worst music in the film.  The opium smoking scene that follows is more bearable mostly because of a more appropriate tone and Mickey Hart's music (""Redux"" did have more of his music and I kinda dug that), but it still added little other than some pretentious ramblings from the woman. Almost as bad as the seduction scene is a new scene with the Playboy bunnies, which criticizes the exploitation of women as sexual objects while it exploits the women as sexual objects.  Overall, ""Redux"" is simply slower, less focused, and more pretentious than the original.  Once again, it's a damn shame that they didn't just release a remastered version of the original for us to enjoy in a theater for all it's cinematic glory. Instead we are left the enjoy the technical marvel of a now deeply flawed film."

You can tell its out of place because after the final fade out there is a copyright statement in the bottom left corner. Similar to the copyrights you see on photographs. There still are no opening credits. I wont go into what the movie is about. It's not professional, but I'm not getting paid. I will note a couple things. The movie is as intense and shocking today, as it was 22 years ago. The story is the same, with a couple key development scenes restored. These scenes add a little more humanity to the boys on the boat. A couple of the scenes are humorous, and one brings our assassin to earth. The best thing about this film is the recurring theme of the film: The chaos and insanity of war. Almost every scene starts, how ""it should"" be, normal, then through intensity and/or chaos everything goes to hell. Pretty much what war is like. The moral issues that are brought up follow this cycle of destruction."

","*Note: This is a review of the original Apocalypse Now released in 1979, not the 2001 ""Re-Dux"", contains some mild SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Francis Coppola's Apocalypse Now is the last great film of the seventies, it's also sadly Coppola's last masterpiece, and only 1983's Rumble Fish has come close to the genius of Apocalypse. Coppola's lose adaptation of Conrad's Heart of Darkness looks at how far one man can be pushed, how power corrupts, and most importantly the influence of darkness on normally sane people. As our hero's in the patrol boat make their way further down river, the grip of Kurtz becomes clearer, the men stop being a unit and begin thinking for themselves, I use the scene when the Vietnamese villagers on the boat are massacred because the chief wants the boat searched, at this point they realise, even if they wanted to turn back they couldn't. The character of Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando acts as a metaphor, he represents the darkness in all of us, so when Willard finally encounters him, he cannot kill him, because actively he would be killing part of himself. It's this power play at the end of the film by Willard and Kurtz that makes Apocalypse Now the film it is, Coppola hides Brando in the shadows, making him seem more mythic, an enigma. There are so many more classic moments in the film, the attack on the village by helicopters, the opening sequences scored to The Doors... But it's the ending in which the ideology of the film becomes clear, Kurtz, much like Willard is just a man, who needs Willard, not even allowing him to feel the satisfaction of his duties. Coppola creates a tense and stark atmosphere, he shoots the surreal landscapes as though he where shooting a horror film, the washed out colours and dark shadows, evoking memories from the classic black and white noir of the fifties, it also must be grouped with Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) as one of the films to inspire the ""look"" of every 80's MTV video. I won't say any more about the film because everybody should be able to interpret the film as they want, all I can say is that it's a true classic, in every way...<br/><br/>9/10"

"heybrakywacky","9","0","0","13 July 2001"," I wanted a mission, and for my sins, they gave me one.
","And what a mission it is!  Apocalypse Now is actually a long mission as movies go, at over 2 1/2 hours.  I know that many people I've talked to complain about this more than most other negative aspects of the film, and I will admit that it gets slow in places.  But in my opinion, it's well worth the time spent, and the movie remains one of my favorites of all-time.<br/><br/>Based on the story ""Heart of Darkness,"" by Joseph Conrad, Apocalypse Now takes place not in the jungles of Africa, but rather the jungles of Vietnam, during the war.  It takes us on the physical and spiritual journey of Captain Benjamin Willard, US Army, through Vietnam ""up a river that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable,"" on his mission to seek out and terminate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, a renegade American soldier whose methods of engaging the enemy have become ""unsound.""  Along the way, we witness the everyday, almost casual, insanity of the Vietnam War through many different situations, as all the while Willard tries to understand his place in the whole state of affairs, and the man he is supposed to kill.  The culmination of events leads to the final showdown between Willard and Kurtz, not in typical Hollywood fashion, but as two men weary of the absurdity, hypocrisy, and lies that have beleaguered them through their many years spent in this Conflict.<br/><br/>While Apocalypse now is more of a cerebral movie, the cinematography and sound score are absolutely phenomenal!  Coppola manages to capture the horror and fear of every segment with his combination of eerie music and vivid camera shots.  I've rarely seen a movie with such complementary sound and vision.<br/><br/>Coupled with that, the character development and presentation are first rate.  The characters do a great job of depicting life in this almost unreal environment, where the landscape is beautiful, and yet people are dying or being horribly injured all the time.  Coppola sets a bizarrely believable stage; it seems all madness, and yet why wouldn't it after being exposed to such extreme circumstances every day, where life has so little value?  And yet, overshadowing all of the everyday madness is the madness of the mission that Willard is sent on, and of those who sent him.  The masters of madness are those who pull the strings.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is a remarkable account of the evils that can beset and wreak havoc upon the human heart and soul.  That theme is solidly reinforced on many interacting levels of complexity, expertly woven together.  It's one of the few movies I've seen that makes such a credible parallel to the book upon which it is based.  I give it 9 out of 10 stars."

Marlon Brando wasn't great (although his character is terrifying and he looks great) in this film, but I felt Laurence Fishburne (Cotton Club, Matrix) was more interesting with his disarming performance.

"Geofbob","Null","0","0","9 June 2001"," A masterpiece
","It is debatable whether or not Francis Ford Coppola succeeds in taking us to the ""heart of darkness"" with this movie, but he certainly shows us, in unique, surreal and indelible images, the monstrosities and absurdities of war. Set pieces like the Wagnerian helicopter attack on a village, the jungle ""centrefold"" concert, the sampan massacre, the defence of the bridge, and the scenes in Kurtz's temple compound all brilliantly illustrate how war blurs the distinctions between heroism and murder, sanity and madness, truth and myth. <br/><br/>As Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) journeys up the river towards its source, towards the dark heart of Col Kurtz (Marlon Brando), he also journeys towards the source of  his own darkness. In finally confronting Kurtz, he confronts part of himself. He has the choice of taking Kurtz's place, and like Kurtz giving himself over entirely to darkness, to horror; of becoming one of the ""hollow men"" of the T S Eliot poem Kurtz reads out. Or of leaving horror and the jungle behind -even if only temporarily - and travelling back down river. In choosing this latter course,  Willard chooses the possibility - no matter how remote - of  lightening his heart.    <br/><br/> The film is probably best regarded as episodic,  rather than as a narrative. Indeed, it falters when it tries to tie its parts together tightly and logically, via Willard's voice-over. Likewise,  as important as Joseph Conrad's original story is for providing the main  theme and plot outline, it would have been better if Coppola had not followed it in certain details, particularly Conrad's hinting that Kurtz has gone over the edge because of the influence of ""primitive"" rituals. As Coppola graphically demonstrates in the gunship and napalming sequences, ""advanced"" people need no instruction in savage  practices from ""primitive"" people. <br/><br/>The performances are dominated by Robert Duvall's surfing-mad, napalm-loving Lt Col Gilmore; and by Brando, who convincingly conveys - sometimes simply by his silent presence - the complexity of the human mind and spirit. In my view, Dennis Hopper's naive and incoherent hippie photographer is given too much screen time. Sheen, apart from his dramatic scenes at the beginning and end of the film, generally plays a passive role, and his part seems under-written in the scenes on the boat - but this may be due to his sickness during the making of the movie. <br/><br/>But the film belongs not to the actors but to Coppola, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, and the editors. From the first hypnotic whirrings and images of helicopters and a ceiling fan to the last mutterings by Sheen of ""horror"", the movie sucks you into its bizarre world. Despite its flaws, this is a masterpiece of film making."

","I first saw Apocalypse Now on TV and it seemed I had forgotten it all except the fact that I didn't find it all that good. The higher the expectations, the deeper the let-down. This year the 'Redux' version has been released and it was time for giving it a second chance. The jungle edge appears on screen. A dusty frame. Then the sound, dust-erratic. Eventually the music heralding the end slices through the dust. To no avail: Jim Morrison's voice permanently settles the torpor of violence that encompasses the whole movie. With no exit. Neither in Saigon nor at the end of the river. The napalm reminds me of what was this movie about. The heavy flames swallowing the resigned trees, human beings at odds with it... this is simply not the typical quest you could easily remember. No Graal, no Lost Ark. You're not relieved to see the hero achieving his goal.<br/><br/>From beginning to end the movie is top art. Coppola likes to shoot his main character telling his mind with few lines but trying to make do with more nervous characters. The Conversation, The Godfather, and even Dracula works that way. You might find it brilliant but you might as well find it boring. The new scenes in the 'Redux' version are not less brilliant (i.e. interesting for movie enthusiasts at least) but do they make the movie greater?

Coppola's Colonel Kurtz is the same except he excells as a soldier. But both have suffered immeasurably because of their drive, cutting themselves off from civilisation and medicine. When we finally get to meet the man he is half dead and quite mad. Conrad's novella is maybe the best anit-colonial story, and this is possibly the best anti-war movie - immortalised in the line from Willard: ""Absolutely goddam right - never get out of the f***ing boat."""

I think the style and structure of the film got to me. Right from the opening montage set to ""The End"", Coppola uses all his film-making skill to draw the viewer into one man's waking nightmare. The trip up the river becomes a metaphor for Willard's journey into the mind of Kurtz. <br/><br/>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)<br/><br/>The touches of absurdity, such as the Wagner during the helicopter attack, the water-skiing behind the boat, and the USO show only add to the feeling that this is all some sort of mad dream.

","1st watched 6/3/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-Francis Coppola): Weird portrayal of insanity that prevailed in different forms by those who fought in the Vietnam wars.  This is much more than a war movie.  It is about ""the horror""(as Brando's character echoes) that consumes human being when they seek after power and meaning in a totally messed-up world. Coppola usually works with extremes which reveals what he is up to in his movies.  The real star of the movie is Martin Sheen because he is there from beginning to end, although Brando got more attention.  Sheen's character is a man who knows nothing but the war and could not leave to go to any other setting.  He is summoned to hunt down Kurtz in Cambodia(outside of our war zone) and is told that he has lost his senses and is leading a group of natives and basically has become their God.  Sheen and a few navy people head up the Nam river to find Kurtz and run into a few strange people along the way.  One (an officer played by Robert Duvall) is more concerned with surfing than being an officer in the war.  What makes this picture works is that the insanity doesn't end.  Kurtz is found and after Sheen's character spends some time with him, he does his duty.  This is insanity in itself because he realizes that Kurtz is no worse than anyone else when he gets there but does not stop himself.

He hailed at as one of the most accurate depictions of the Vietnam war. Watching it, one might scoff at the larger than life characters of Kurtz or Kilgore.  What people miss, however, is that this goes far beyond being a war movie, due in part to the book it was based on.  This is a journey into the darker regions of the soul - to the heart of darkness.  Coppola skillfully lays this ""map"" down by characters such as Duvall's Kilgore character, who states that the war will end someday, mirroring it to Dennis Hopper's character, who in turn states the world was going to end, which proceeds to a cinematic ending depicting the full journey to a heart of darkness.  Not a great movie if your trying to do a thesis on the horrors of Vietnam, but more interesting if your wanting to explore the darker depths of the human heart.

A virtual maelstrom throughout, continually cacophonous and frenetic, the auteur that brought us the GODFATHER saga explores the darkness of man's soul as well as the tumult that was Vietnam. Coppola weaves the motifs of violence and dread between scenes that have become ingrained in movie history lore.  The fulminations of the Air Cav attack and Do Lung Bridge battle are set ominously against a surreal background and vagarious dialouge.  The only problem here is that such a cataclysmic backdrop desensitizes the viewer; a flat surface of violence leaves no peaks and valleys in which the audience can breathe.  The ending is much more ambigious than Coppola may have intended (see DVD Special Features--Destruction of Kurtz Compound).  Is Kurtz coming to terms with the one eternal truth: That horror (and therefore war) is the only pure thing in life?  Or is it that Williard has now cleansed his soul through the blood of Kurtz and can finally leave the Nam?  Or was the entire film simply dressing around the ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning"" line?  Great flick.

Well, do yourself a favor, and ignore narrow minded reviews such as these. To compare them like that is unfair, as all of these movies are great in there own way, and all should be seen. Apocolypse Now may be seen as slow moving (and the Deer Hunter isn't!?) but it is without question visually stunning. A true filmakers masterpiece.

","This is by far the best war movie I have ever seen. It starts off with a fantastic opening of bombs and napalm going off in and around palm trees while ""The End"" by the Doors is hauntingly played. To me that is one of the best opening scenes in any movie. It also features phenomenal performances by Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall who delivers one of the most famous lines in any movie: ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning."" This movie in my opinion features the last great Marlon Brando performance as Col. Kurtz one of the best movie villains ever. Coppola directs this movie with great detail and pulls no punches. However like all movies, it is not perfect. The ending is somewhat weak and Brando is only in the last quarter of the movie. But it is still a masterpiece and is in my personal top ten list. A solid 9 out of ten."

","If ever the grasp of a movie exceeded its reach, it was this one.  Which, in fairness to Coppola, is also true of the original novel, Heart of Darkness. Everybody had to read the damn thing in high school or first year english, and no one really understands it.<br/><br/>Actually, when you consider the subject matter a bit of ambiguity is called for anyway, in my mind.<br/><br/>I love this movie because it has that wonderful flavour of a moment. I remember the first time I saw it in a theatre, and looking back at the amazing cast years later, it is a delight to see so many talented actors either on top of their game (Duvall) or just starting out (fishburne and Ford). Its one of those movies that makes you nostalgic for when it was first issued. And it is one of those movies that if you stumble across it while channel surfing late at night, you can settle in and watch a few minutes of it, or the rest of it, without effort. When I got a DVD, it was at the top of the ""I have to see this on DVD"" list.<br/><br/>And the amazing lines. Everyone remembers the scene with ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"".  But what about the two guys at the bridge who turn to Willard from behind their machine gun and say to him in response to a request to see their commanding officer ""I thought you were the commanding officer,"".   What about the line in the original briefing ""We have found kurtzs methods to be.... unsound.""<br/><br/>The surfing scene, the arrows and spear scene, the hotel room scene in the beginning, the water skiing scene, the beach party after the fire fight, the shot up fishing boat, Kurtz's compound, the playmates, the bridge, the helicopters and planes in the tree ups the river.  Visually this movie has more stuff than a dozen others and that includes most of the other Viet Nam flicks.<br/><br/>Sure, the thing tanks a bit when Brando as Kurtz finally shows up, but its a let down in the novel too.  Nobody could live up to the mystique the story wraps around the character of Kurtz.  I still think George C. Scott or William Holden would have been a better choice. No offence Marlon.<br/><br/>Coppola has stuck his name on a bunch of crap over the years, but this one was worthy.<br/><br/>Flawed, imperfect but still a great movie."

","Apocalypse Now is my number 128 movie. I usually like movies about wars, and this one made no exception. It is about a guy ( Martin Sheen ) who goes to Vietnam to search for a guy ( Marlon Brando )that exercises control in a province in Vietnam ( the special thing is that he´s American ).<br/><br/>When I watched this film, I thought it was more a movie like the last 60 minutes of Full Metal Jacket"" . But it was not. There were also some war-sequences, but it concentrates on Martin Sheen searching with a group of soldiers for the guy. And I thought that he finds him way earlier, not 20 minutes before the film ended. I think it was a good war-movie with a lot of inner suspense. And that was the great thing about this movie.<br/><br/>
Apocalypse Now is not a film about Vietnam as ´Platoon´ or ´Full Metal Jacket´ are. It just concentrates on the search, and not the war itself. That was a good idea.<br/><br/>I was very lucky to see Harrison Ford in this movie, because I just love him. He is my favorite actor of all time.<br/><br/>I think that Apocalypse Now is not one of the greatest movies of all time, but it is good.

"leybman","9","0","0","23 January 2001"," A Visually Astounding War Movie With Emotion and Power
","When Apocalpyse  Now first premiered, it was the subject of much scandal and gossip. It was rumoured that Coppola never liked the ending,which has been talked about by many critics. There were rumours of tension on the set between Coppola and Brando. That Brando had showed up overweight and was simply not ready.<br/><br/>Once the movie finally premiered, it was immediately acclaimed as maybe the greatest war movie ever made. With its technical affects and beautiful directing, some of the best I have ever seen, it was named as one of the hundred greatest films ever made. It's famous catch-phrase, which has become as memorable as anything else, ""I love the smell of nepalm in the morning"" has drenched itself into the English language.<br/><br/>
While the movie has had its critics, for the last act which many deem to be flawed, it is still maybe one of the most powerful movies ever made. It was nominated for 8 academy awards and won two for best editing and best cinematography.<br/><br/>The movie chronicles the events of Benjamin Willard on a mission to find the elusive Kurtz, played by Brando, and to ""kill him."" On now cinemtically famous trip down the river, he studies the man and wonders what could have made him leave all the wars behind and live in seclusion with followers. Kurtz had at one point been one of the greatest soldiers in the army. One of the most admired people there, with every award imaginable, but one day, a call was received. He had started giving out orders for things that were not requested by the army. He had won the battles, alright, but it was not authorized. Pretty soon the army could handle it no longer and wanted to get him back.<br/><br/>He wouldn't come back. A previous soldier had been asked to find him there and he himself decided to stay there with a letter to his wife saying ""sell the house, sell the children..."" This fixation is pressed upon a the Willard character, a person in bad need of redemption, a person so accustomed to war, it has now become a fixation. The majority of the movie takes place with a wide assortment of characters as they are led through a river to where Willard must get of. In through the characters on the boat we see different assortments of people and the way they choose to deal with death and dying. The characters pass upon people dying, and making a brief stop at a base to where they can enjoy some playboy playmates.<br/><br/>The story moves on and into the final act. Through that we see and understand things about the war. We see how the human being is dehumanised through war.  We begin to see the struggle of managing and training people to kill others. We begin to see the unindividualised attitude of the whole idea of war.<br/><br/>The movie ends with the now famous lines made by Willard: the horror, the horror<br/><br/>The movie I must say in my opinion is the greatest war movie ever made in trying to portray the physical side of war. The moving and image shots of the airplanes in the air, the airplanes crashed through trees, the shots of soldiers fighting and murdering. The scene, my personal favorite, with Duvall's character putting on Wagner Ride of the Valykires was spectacular. The special effects, which are ten times more powerful than anything hollywood has ever produced, were simply spectacular. The directing was astounding and should have won the Oscar in 1979. Its overall imagry and brutally honest portrayel of war was simply amazing.<br/><br/>But it is not a perfect movie. It has its flaws. The character of Sheen, in my opinion was not right. I think his character came through the movie as a parody of what we think a character like him should be. The movie itself, in my opinion came of a parody in certain parts, especially in the beginning with the voice-overs. There was lots of great acting, but none that I would say perfect. At times it seemed as if they were ooveracting and simply being too unrealistic. The voice-overs in my opinion were very important though to make sure that the audience doesn't get bored and tune of out of the movie while the shots of the airplanes were shown. The voice-overs worked as entertainment for the audience during scenes that would have seemed unnecessary if not for the distraction of the voice-over.<br/><br/>
I do not think this is the greatest war movie ever made. I don't think anything can be the greatet war movie ever made. A war movie deals with so much and so many topics, it is literally impossible to create a war movie that is perfect in everything sense. The two things taht war movies usually deal with are: the realism of war through its shots and camera work and battle footage, and the other thing is the psychological side of war, what it does to man, how it does it to man, why it does it to man. This was done incredibly well in Apocalypse Now, but it wasn't it's main focus, that's it failed to be the best of all movies at it. Apocalypse's job was simply to be real and brutally honest on hour war appears and seems to the one who is in it.<br/><br/>But I must say this movie was incredible in every other respect. As I said earlier, its directing was incredible, the visuals powerful, the scenes memorable, brutally honest, real, and ambitious in every way. In some ways its ambition caused it in some ways to fail, but in other ways it made it into ""one of the greatest movies ever made""-American Film Institute."

I get the sense that the director has taken the story and translated it into the context of his life, then translated that into a collective modern context that would make the connection comprehensible for us.  Ultimately it is an exploration of that hidden secret connection between good and evil.  Is evil really opposed to good, or does it just think it is?  Is evil, ultimately, merely a part of good, something that acts to produce it, test it, bring it out?  What is the PURPOSE of evil in the world?  How many of us have recoiled from the horrors of the world and asked, ""If there is a God, how can there be such a thing as evil?!""

Most of the camera-shots could be a role-model for loads of modern films... Anyone see 187 starring Sam l.Jackson? From my point of view it had a lot of similar shots.

"baldterror","10","0","0","7 November 2000"," Greatest Film Ever Made?
","Well, I happen to think so.  I tend to judge films on their emotional impact and I've never seen another film that is as viscerally involving as this one.  The film actually gets more disturbing after multiple viewings when you know what is coming.  Then the awful events loom over you instead of sneaking up on you. The film has a flimsy plot which it derives from it's source material, Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness.""  While it employs the structure of Willard's boat journey up a river to find Kurtz it employs it to different meaning. Conrad's novel was a deconstruction of colonialism but Coppola's subject is war.  But he famously said, ""My film isn't about Vietnam.  It is Vietnam."" Coppola's film isn't really interested in the specific politics of the Vietnam War.  The extent to which it is even really a ""war"" film is debatable. Truffaut said it was impossible to make an anti-war film because film by it's energy tends to argue for war by making it seem exciting.  This film uses that fact intentionally.  The horror of war is brought home to us not by our witnessing it, but by our taking part in it.  Apocalypse Now's technique is to create an anti-war film not by having us critique war from the outside, but by involving us in the actual thing itself.  We are forced to confront our own heart of darkness as a result.  We must look within ourselves and see how we would have reacted in the same circumstances. What is the meaning of war?, is the final question of the film.  The film has come under criticism because the ending does not provide a tidy resolution for this theme.  But the resolution is the arc of the entire movie.  When we get to the heart of the darkness at the center of war we don't find any answer that is expressed in intellectual terms.  That is the film's ultimate message: war is not a product of our intellect but of our deepest human nature, our human heart of darkness. Do you think yourself the master of your own heart of darkness?  So did Kurtz..."

","I don't know where to start, other than this movie is one of the best examples of perceptive cinematography and subject matter. I had to like it when I heard ""The End"" by the Doors, which is my favorite Doors song, and it definitely took vision in how to incorporate a song about the violent blossoming of freedom and the scoring for it! I heard Eleanor Coppola had a lot to do w/ getting this movie finished, hands for her! All the elements in this film help to wield the manic presence that holds the viewer until the release at the end, I can't think of any  SPOILERS to use with my comments, but it's my feeling that if anyone is reading this before they see this movie, it's a SPOILER enough. Martin Sheen is drugged, driven and excellent in his performance, Marlon Brando and the film makers were so subtle w/ his character's presence that some people can't sense Colonel Kurtz' engaging and deviation of Captain Willard, in which the Colonel saves the Captain from his doomed end. Watch and you will see that the Colonel was the sacrifice. This little theme, if I remember correctly, is what deviated this movie from Joseph Conrad's book. Francis Ford Coppola and Vittorio Storato aren't the only names who should be praised, everyone who had something to do w/ this film holds my praise for great filmmaking. A 10, hands down!"

","Director of Photography Vittorio Storaro and Production Designer Dean Tavoularis are the real stars of Francis Ford Coppola's epic rumination on the nature of battle. Tavoularis has fashioned a convincing replica of Vietnam with an eye towards the shifting landscapes both of the terrain and the American infiltration of it; and Storaro's deep focus tracking camera captures all the verdancy of the land and the orange explosions that come to describe the sky above. The remainder is also impressive: Coppola, along with co-scriptwriter John Milius, has written a thoughtful, compelling visualization of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"" and the conclusions they reach (that adherence to innate rules of combat is more moral than the civility of organized war) make sense in the context of Vietnam. The visuals don't capture the heartbreak of assault as fully as one would like (Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" would surpass it on that level) but it remains compulsively watchable even as it grows increasingly moody and reserved.

The 1970s was a great decade for Francis, all his films were masterpieces back then and this one is no exception.<br/><br/>The film is about a man who is disillusioned with Saigon and is thrown into a mission to terminate a green beret soldier, Marlon Brando. That's all I want to say regarding the story. The film is a journey into madness and insanity. We journey with Willard played by Martin Sheen with a group of soldiers, each one with a different persona.. We meet insane people, we see the most stupid situations. The film clearly points out how stupid and insane everything in war is. There is quite a bit that I'll leave you to figure out, I don't want to spoil it for you.<br/><br/>Technically, this picture is amazing, my jaw drops everytime I see the incredible helicopter action and the explosions. How can anyone direct this? Only Francis could. The photography is easily the best I've ever seen printed on celluloid, the colours are amazing. Everything Francis did on this picture is amazing, I can't praise him enough.<br/><br/>The performances are amazing, Sheen is so perfect, his best performance. Marlon Brando is debatable, I mean there are a few people who could've played Kurtz, I didn't think Marlon gave his best but he was still very good. Dennis Hopper is crazy in this picture, he's excellent even though his part isn't that big. Everyone else was excellent, it must've been a tough picture for the actors, watch out for Fishbourne, he's pretty cool in this.<br/><br/>Once you've seen this amazing picture, please watch ""Hearts of Darkness"".

It's a great subject...but not necessarily an EXCITING subject.  Don't get me wrong, the movie has a lot of relevant statements to make and makes them extremely well.  The conclusions drawn are haunting and logical in a twisted way; you know Kurtz is right, even though you don't want to believe it.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>You really have to let yourself get drawn in by the narrative.  This is a long, extended commentary on the black corners of the human heart.  Nothing is necessarily resolved; things just happen to the main characters, they react, and the audience forms their conclusions.  In any other film, this ""hands-off"" approach might be viewed as laziness.  But Coppola weaves the story in such a way as to mesmerize you...provided you're in the right mood for it.

Distorted swishing sounds coming through the soundtrack, getting slightly louder as an army copter comes by. Smoke begins to rise as a tinkly bell sounds, seguing into a haunting tune. All the while, like a leitmotif in a Wagner opera, the swishing continues, getting slightly louder as yet another copter goes by. The jungle explodes with fire as Jim Morrison begins singing the first lines of the only Doors tune that I can truly say that I have ever liked: ""The End"".<br/><br/>It wasn't until those first few moments that I understood what Harlan Ellison was talking about when he named Francis Ford Coppola as one of the greatest directors in the world (other notables on that list included Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, and Luis Buenel). I'd already heard a little about the background behind this film; Martin Sheen wrote an article about it a few years back. Having seen the finished product of ""Apocalypse Now"", I have no trouble believing whatsoever that every calamity that befell the production actually happened. The kind of chaos and darkness that wound up on the screen wouldn't be near as convincing if it hadn't been a reflection of what was really happening on the set.<br/><br/>As the POV character on this modern interpretation of Dante's Inferno (yes, I realize this is based on Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", but Dante's version of Hell served as a nice reference guide for reasons I will explain later), Martin Sheen as Capt. Willard is human enough to make the viewer sympathize with him a little and INhuman enough to make said viewer feel repulsed by the depths he winds up sinking to...which is, actually, straight down to the bottom. He's given a seemingly simple mission: kill an insane colonel who's become a law unto himself. But once things get rolling, the simplicity goes right out the window.<br/><br/>First we meet Col. Kilgore (a great, memorable performance from Robert Duvall), who actually isn't too dissimilar to Kurtz in that he's doing what he think will wind up winning the war (when he's not busy thinking about surfing; such an attitude would qualify him for the first circle of Hell, Virtuous Pagans). Then we see things escalate, little by little: the riot at the USO show (Lust), the massacre of the tampan crew(Pride), the endless battle of keeping one lousy bridge in operation(Wrath). Along the way, we get to know more about Kurtz's background, which makes him look a little less insane and more rational than the mess he's in. The lines begin to blur.<br/><br/>How could I not think of Cocytus, the very last level of the Inferno, when we finally get to meet Col. Walter E. Kurtz? In Dante's conception, the devil stands at it's center, mindlessly flapping it's wings and freezing souls over in the process. It's a fair description what Kurtz has managed to do to all his followers. After all, isn't man his own ultimate devil? The only one who doesn't seem to be too affected (though he's definitely touched in the head by the rest of the insanity) is Dennis Hopper's riddle-talking photojournalist. Kurtz himself (played with great and underacknowledged aplomb by Marlon Brando) is a little harder to figure out. He goes off on bizarre tangents in any conversation, will chop off the head of anyone who threatens him and then seems to regret it, talks seeming nonsense into Army radio frequencies, reads poetry aloud to anyone who'll listen (the choice of T.S. Eliot's ""The Hollow Men"" is no coincidence; it actually contains a quote from ""Hearts of Darkness"": ""Mister Kurtz, he dead."")but one doesn't get the feeling that he's actually insane (my theory is that those who say that he is have given up trying to figure him out). There's a lot of pain involved with what he's become, but even that doesn't sum him up. Brando's Kurtz is like quicksilver; just when you think you've got a handle on him, he slips through your fingers.<br/><br/>Could his end really have come any other way? Eliot said it himself in ""The Hollow Men"": ""This is the way the world ends/This is the way the world ends/This is the way the world ends/Not with a bang, but with a whimper."" But it coming from Brando, what a whimper: ""the horror...the horror"". The horror he's talking about is what human beings can allow themselves to become. Not just in war, but any great disaster that strikes at and breaks the foundations of any person's view of the world. That is why this movie is ultimately NOT about Vietnam; it's about what happens to Everyman when he learns dark truths that can not be rationalized and can not be denied. The Vietnam War was Kurtz's catalyst...who can say what ours could be?"

","Coppola, Sheen, Brando, Duvall, Hopper, Ford, Fishburne......A veritable Who's Who of dramatic theater, then and now!<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. Martin Sheen is the ultimate warrior as Captain Willis, the Special Forces hero sent off to find and ""Terminate with extreme prejudice"" the elusive and insane Col Kurtz (BIG BRANDO).<br/><br/>Not a day goes by that I don't use a phrase or thought from this movie in my everyday life. ""Never get off the f___ing boat, man"" is a philosophy in itself....I can relate, Chef. ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning...."" is a regular one for those early morning office bitch sessions. People often look at me weird when I use these phrases, but I just figure they haven't seen the movie..oh well..their loss!<br/><br/>Overall, this is a dark movie with a penchant for doom, but it does a great job in developing the characters and telling the uglier side of the story of the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>If you liked this one, see ""Hearts of Darkness, the making of Apocalypse"". What a great movie making documentary. It really gives you a whole new appreciation for what the folks went through to make this movie. Get 'em both and watch 'em back to back!"

","One of Kubrick's best and certainly the most gut-wrenching & cerebral films. This isn't your typical warfilm of ""them and us"" and it would be a mistake to think of this film in the same context as Platoon or SPR.<br/><br/>This is a far more implicit, personal tale of a Captain's insular view of a world finally gone mad - there are so many one-liners throughout the film that signpost to good effect the blatant contradictions of America's true purpose in this war - Kurtz is a top Colonel of the old school; a tactical genius who finally flips when his own side declares that he murdered rather than ""killed"" spies even though all the evidence pointed in his favour.<br/><br/>Other contradictions include the summary above - of a man who has gone beyond acceptable human conduct. And yet you get US aircraft dumping napalm on remote villages maiming women & children.<br/><br/>Sheen's Captain Willard's mind is full of these contradictions to the extent that he is gradually losing focus on what his true purpose is out there. His only solace is drugs & booze while praying/dreading the next mission: a mission into the heart of darkness.<br/><br/>The entire film is really nothing more than what is going on in Willard's deug induced chaotic mind - there are so many unbalanced things going on: kids surfing, tanning and listening to Jimi Hendrix, Bunny Girls appearing & disappearing out of the Heavens; a photo journalist high on drugs but full on poetic enlightenment!<br/><br/>Wherever he looks he sees conspiracy to cover up other people's concepts of indiscretion. Later he meets Lieutenant Kilgore (apt surname) supremely played by Duvell, who seems to consider finding the best time & place to surf more important than carrying out his mission. But even after one particular battle he comes reflective that very soon the war is going to end even though he ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning"". There is no happiness in his voice at the thought of the war ending, far from it, he wants it to last forever because that gives him (and perhaps many other one-dimensional officers) a purpose, a political (not moral) reason; an excuse to carry out their actions with impunity; and yet at the same time Willard has to hunt down & kill a decent General on a trumped up charge, because ""he has gone beyond the pale""!<br/><br/>It goes on & on, the bulls__t never ends; and this is Coppola's message. American 4 star generals blame their own mistakes on others and want those mistakes ""terminated with extreme prejudice"". Kurtz proved to a  thorn in their side and want him ""terminated"" but for not obeying orders to kill only those they want him to kill.<br/><br/>If you've seen the documentary you will be aware of how much time, effort & money (and health!) it took to get the printed word onto film and in my judgement it is perhaps the best movie indictment of America's protracted stay in Vietnam, and more specifically, Cambodia. (a film even Oliver Stone would be proud of)<br/><br/>The acting, with the exception of Brando, is truly breathtaking, especially from Sheen as a man high on booze & drugs and who can flip is normally cool manner with acts of sudden violence & aggression (the machine gun attack on the boat)<br/><br/>Brando, I feel, ruined the movie; more so when you read about his exploits off it. He really didn't give a s**t about the book or Coppola's vision, so the committment & acting you do finally see from him is really just bogus. The ending seemed like an afterthought and wasn't very well executed after such a long & dramatic beginning.<br/><br/>You have to see this film time & time again because it is an insane vision seen from an insane mind during and insane war where drugs or bullets are the only true means of escape.<br/><br/>If you want simplicity go see Platoon; if you want a guilty conscience on behalf of your own past Governments rent this and wonder how this could ever have been allowed to happen!<br/><br/>

The craziness, the confusion, and the entire ""Who's in charge?"" attitude probably provide one of the best fictionalized accounts of what it was like to be in the Viet Nam war. It already appears to be a bit dated, and the journey up the river and meeting with Kurtz do seem to drag on a bit, but it's still an excellent movie all the way around and still does a good job at pointing out how senseless war really is.<br/><br/>Like I said, I'm not a big war-movie buff, but this enthralling movie is one of my all-time favorite films.

"appell","10","0","0","24 June 2000"," No other war movies compare
","Apocalypse Now is one of the rare treats of the war film genre. Not only does Francis Ford Coppola's dazzling direction realistically portray the atmosphere of Vietnam, but this film above all is very cerebral and profound, qualities that the vast majority of war movies lack.  Instead of the constant and often monotonous war action scenes depicted in films like Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now strives to utilize these scenes as a backdrop for the engaging and complex characters that are of much greater importance to the film.  <br/><br/>The two most significant characters of the movie are played by Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando.  Sheen plays a Vietnam war captain who has been ordered by the military to kill Brando, a former colonel who has strayed from the military's commands and has formed his own band of warriors in Cambodia. Also, Robert Duvall turns in a brilliant performance as an American general in Vietnam who seems oblivious to the effects of the war and more interested in having fun than seriously fighting the war.  Besides these main characters, the rest of the film's personas do not critically influence the movie.  However, all of them serve to underscore the chaotic and almost insane nature of American involvement in Vietnam, which seems to be the underlying message that Coppola and co-writer John Milius attempt to convey. <br/><br/>Much of the brilliance of this movie can be attributed to its many ironies, such as how the military branded Brando as a lunatic, although it was the military who played a large role in influencing his condition.  However, the greatest irony of all in the movie lies in its conclusion.  This atmosphere of recklessness is also very important to Sheen's character because it shows him to be a man of contempt for the military's actions and policies in Vietnam but simultaneously a man who is indifferent to them.  His persona is still more complex because he in a way wants to stay in Vietnam despite its horrors because he has no one back home who cares for him anymore.  But probably the most complicated character is Brando's, as he attributes his ruthlessness to the deception of the military of unfairly judging their enemies as well as themselves in the war.  <br/><br/>Apocalypse Now gives an extremely radical perspective of the Vietnam War, but in my opinion, the film comments more on the nature of war in general. It demonstrates how the different conceptions of morality and compassion in a war setting can change the individual that seriously ponders them.  Four stars out of four."

","With the flood of war stories on the shelves of your local video store, it is often hard to separate the wheat from the chaff.  This is especially true when taking into consideration the number of films centering around the Vietnam war.  This particular film is among the best, however.<br/><br/>Based on Joseph Conrad's book ""Heart of Darkness"", this is the story of one man's trip into the lion's den.  He is given a mission by his superiors, and undoubtedly, it will change his life.  From beginning to end, this film is a descent into the madness of war.  With fantastic imagery, superb characters, and an excellent adaptation of Conrad's story, this film is tops.<br/><br/>I first watched this film about 5 years ago, when I was taking a history course in University that dealt with the Vietnam war.  Well, I was surprised to find that the story many history textbooks tell doesn't come close to the events represented in this book.  While fictional, this film put the Vietnam war into a whole new light.  It is violent, it is dark, and it is all too real.<br/><br/>If you have never seen this film, what are you waiting for?  Many people can't be bothered to see a war film, whether it be due to the violence, or the fact that many of them are the same as any other.  This one stands alone, and it does so because it is so much more than a ""war film"" per se. It is a story of insanity and darkness in times of war.  It shows the reasons why many men and women can and do slip from sanity into the depths of insanity in times of war.  And it is simply unforgettable.<br/><br/>My Rating:  10/10<br/><br/>After viewing this film, I suggest you watch ""Hearts of Darkness:  A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"".  It is a documentary of how the film was made, and the many issues and problems that surrounded the filming of this movie.  An awesome follow-up effort."

"jmcody","10","0","0","13 May 2000"," The quintessential american movie
","The great film, Apocalypse Now, although certainly not the greatest American Film ever made, plays much like America herself (himself?). Coppola said during the film's premier that the film isn't about Vietnam, that is is Vietnam. He certianly could be talking about the native country he hails from as his creation almost perfectly captures the glorious imperfections that is The United States.Since I am only limited to 1000 words, I'll try and be brief. Like America, Apocalypse Now is: frequently pretentious and obnoxious, overbearing and white male dominated, carthartic and broad, bold and imperialistic, beautiful and yet unforgiving, mad, violent, loud and sloppy, over running with great ideas (some fullfilled-others half baked), exhilerating and mortifying, haunting and sentimental, holy and evil, deadly and vibrant, rough and cultured, exploitive and exposing, terrifying and harrowing, reverant and still extremely defiant, plentiful and thoughougly wasteful, independant and slavish, liberal and yet somehow conservative in its worldview,  and therefore, ultimately consistently fascinating and stunning. There has never been anything like it before or since. It is an experiment that no film maker will ever be willing to gamble with again in creating. Like a true work of art, this film is unique and one of a kind.Coppola's film reaches the hallmark of many great works of art- it refuses to allow the viewer to sit on a philosophical fence. Because the film is pure cinema in its use of visual and sonic images to tell a story, Coppola forces the viewer to react firstly emotionally to his narrative (the intellectual side can be engaged later if need be). One will either hate it or love it- there is no middle ground. This is much like the world's image of America as a country. Based upon the many mult-national contributors to this outstanding sight, my native country is viewed in those devisive terms. Based too on the many views of this film, the world is split as to whether or not this film is the work of a mad genius or an ugly prententious waste of time. In that respect, the only other film that comes close to Now is in fact Kubrick's 2001. For I can think of no other film that has split so many viewers. For this reviewer, Apocalypse Now is the film 2001 wants so desperately to be. Whereas, I find that film distant and cold, Now is exactly that: immediate and captivating.Now is not the work of a cold visual genius, it is instead the work of a fevered madman desperately holding on to his camera in an effort to keep himself from falling into the abyss. Based upon his career since, Coppola didn't stick to the high ground- he fell.Much like America herself in oh so many examples.Although not a perfect film, Apocalypse Now is a great film. It is the quintessential American Movie. A 10 out of 10."
"ablokh","Null","0","0","7 May 2000"," a surrealisticly beautiful, yet horrifying ballet of horror
","Horror and Beauty ""Horror and moral terror are your friendsÂ…"" Those words from Apocalypse Now still haunt me and call to mind some of the more horrible scenes from the movie.  Yet, you know sometimes when you finish watching a movie, and then feel like you must have missed some deeper meaning?  This happened to me after watching Apocalypse Now, so I have decided that the ideas in this movie are simply above my very limited understanding.  To me it was a movie about the horrors of war, and the inhuman strength needed to cope with these horrors.  If there is more to the movie, so be it, maybe someone can explain it to me.  As for the actors, the choice of Marlon Brando (Col. Kurtz) was great, as his lisp gave his otherwise frightening character somewhat of a human touch.  Sheen (Capt. Willard) was very good, but somehow did not stand out as much.  Finally, Duvall (Lt. Col. Killgore) was suprisingly wonderful, even in the little role he had. The movie has some of the greatest visuals I have ever seen, especially for its time.  The war scenes were frighteningly brutal, and yet very surrealistic (the armada of helicopters, the burning bridge, the lit up military base).  Wherein lies somewhat of a problem.  Instead of the scenes of war looking totally realistic, such as in the recent Saving Private Ryan, they looked more like a well-rehearsed ballet of horror, watched through a serious acid trip. What makes these scenes so powerful, however, is the fact that when you are watching them, you realize how beautiful some of them are. But if you find depictions of war beautiful, what kind of person does that make you?  This question that you ask yourself ends up being a key part in the main theme of the movie. This movie is one of images, much more than it is one of words.  What the characters speak is simply a backdrop to what we are witnessing on screen. Needless to say, the cinematography and special effects are absolutely amazing.  The plot however is very simple.  A Vietnam veteran, Capt. Benjamin Willard (Sheen), is called back into the war to assassinate a Col. Kurtz (Brando), who has gone mad and has begun executing the locals. Willard travels there on a boat with mostly fresh recruits, and we witness as they come to grips with the horrors of war.  As he reads about the general he is to kill, he slowly begins to understand him more and more. Finally, as he arrives, he has to face the reality of the madness of this man, and the strange society he has created on his base. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone, but you must be careful of watching it with preconceived notions or expectations.  It is definitely an experience unlike any other, as I know of no movie that is even remotely like this one.  Still, it is quite strange, and different people will take away different things from it.  Vietnam was truly a horrible war, compared even to WWII.  While in the later it was clear who the enemy was, in the former, the peasant you see on the street could be a simple, common man, or a someone carrying a grenade in his pocket.  This movie definitely reflects this fear and uncertainty in some of the most brutal and unforgettable scenes that I have ever watched.  However, a lot of the time, we do not even see the enemy that the soldiers are fighting, which is what makes many of the scenes so surrealistic.  So if you are looking for a completely realistic depiction of war, this movie might not be for you.  If, however, you want to see war in all its horror, and yet surrealistic beauty, then definitely rent it."

Robert Duvall is superb as the wild surfing fanatic/Air Calvary leader Kilgore who says a few famous quotes after a helicopter attack on a small village that's held by the Viet Cong.  Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, and Larry Fishburne have some solid moments as the members of PT crew that take Willard in Cambodia.  It takes a while before the boat meets its destination where we find Kurtz's camp and surprise, an American pot smoking photojournalist is there to greet the surviving members of the PT crew and Willard.  The photojournalist is wonderfully played by Dennis Hopper who is also there like Willard to find out more about Kurtz.  Then Kurtz (Brando) himself enters the picture in a way that no one could have ever thought of at the time.  It does get bogged before I see what happens to Kurtz and it doesn't look pretty.

I have to agree with that, as a student of Psychology and as a member of the human race.<br/><br/>As for technical aspects, the film looks great, beautiful shots of Hueys and the Phillipeens really sell this tale of the Vietnam war. The acting of the boat crew and all the other suporting cast is outstanding, with Martin Shean's blending in perfectly.

"MartinHafer","9","3","8","18 October 2011"," As long as you realize it's FICTION, you're okay...
","My biggest complaint about ""Apocalypse Now"" is that many who view it might think this is exactly like the Vietnam War. Instead, it's almost like a non-funny spoof--satirizing it instead of showing an actual view of the war. The film shoves a decade of surreal incidents and some completely fictional ones along with incorporating Joseph Conrad's book ""Heat of Darkness"" and the Herzog film ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" into this vision. The results are pretty amazing...just NOT the actual Vietnam War. In other words, there was too much craziness for one movie--but it did make for exciting and compelling viewing nevertheless.<br/><br/>The first 2/3 of the film is very much like ""Aguirre"", as it shows a group of misfits taking a CIA operative (Martin Sheen) upriver into Cambodia on a secret assassination mission. Along the way, TONS of insane little vignettes are shoved into the movie--some of which are patently ridiculous. Now I must say that when the film was released, some of the more surreal and ridiculous scenes were removed--such as the Playboy bunny scenes which simply make no logical sense. But the reason so much illogic is shoved into the film is that the filmmaker, Francis Ford Coppola, was NOT trying to make a true depiction of the war. I wish some of this craziness had been toned down a bit--after all, I am a retired history teacher and love truly accurate depictions. But this film is highly fictionalized and Coppola surely wasn't trying to make a documentary.<br/><br/>The final portion is basically right out of ""Heart of Darkness""--with massive changes here and there (such as the purpose of the visit to Kurtz). Now if you haven't read this book, I do NOT recommend you do so. Believe me, it is one of the more difficult and tedious books I've ever read (yes, English professors, I know you will hit me with lots of 'not helpfuls' because I said this). And, while over the top in many ways, at least it was entertaining--something that could never be said about the book (which, by the way, was not a war story and was set in the Belgian Congo). In fact, an English teacher friend of mine admitted, after I pressured him, that the book was insufferable.<br/><br/>So is the film any good? Sure. Very well done. But remember, it's NOT a work of non-fiction. Now I am NOT defending the Vietnam War (it was screwed up in every way and was one of the dumbest moments in US history) but just don't want the gullible to assume it's fact. For at least a closer view of the reality of the war, try watching ""Full Metal Jacket"". But, for a crazy, surreal and mesmerizing view, give ""Apocalypse Now"" a look. It's like nothing you've ever seen before...<br/><br/>FYI--It should surprise no one that this is a VERY adult movie--especially the ""Redux"" release of 2001.

","Apocalypse Now and Then is what screenwriter Robert Towne said of this movie: magnificent and a shambles in equal measure.<br/><br/>It's sprawling range and portentous style are awesome as is the photography and there are many failed films saved in reputation by the photography. Citizen Kane being a prime example.<br/><br/>While it's worth watching, even in parts according to interest and time availability, the first hour is better than the rest, and especially the third hour in the Redux version.<br/><br/>The reason is the writing: a narrated film about a character that has not appeared is not a drama, it works in a book, and Hearts of Darkness is stunning prose, although the portentousness wears thin toward the second half.<br/><br/>In a movie the novelists' technique fails because we can see the world, framed and edited, but essentially realistic. In that space the drama should be performed, or else it's a novel with pictures and a narrator, which is what Apocalypse Now is. The writing has to be interesting, in the narrator's mouth and the dialog, as there is little real drama happening to keep the audience involved, but here the script misses exposing the extent of Coppola's mediocrity as a writer.<br/><br/>In Apocalypse the characters are meaningless, although events happen to them to show the audience how depraved war and this war was; but on and on the background intelligence progresses as the real drama is an intellectual one played between US foreign policy and the American people, especially those who were anti war."

","I have seen many a film. I'm studying acting (woopie do, eh?) and I watched this movie because Marlon Brando was in it. The film started off interestingly enough and to be very fair to it, the first 30 to 40 minutes were good and fairly intriguing. there was some excellent camera work and wonderful images (e.g. the helicopters coming over the waves, brilliant).<br/><br/>Then the film goes downhill. the character developments were appalling. I didn't feel an ounce of sadness when any of the main characters died. I was just intrigued to see the final showdown- Brando and Sheen. That was disappointing too, except for Brando's great monologue. it is a classic monologue, but for an actor of Brando's ability, he deserved more in the movie. i could watch him all day and he out-classed everyone as usual. However, Sheen was very good.<br/><br/>There was too much sex and nudity and this ruined the movie. That kind of stuff is better off in a playboy magazine. I think any movie that uses sex and nudity is not a classic, because it relies on this to get people interested. Romantic movies could have good intimate scenes, but the directors NEVER manage to show true love between two actors. Most actors don't know what love is, so when they are told to do scenes of this nature, they always act bordering on pride, which is not love. the only film that ever did show real intimacy and beauty was Titanic i think. 9 songs was a disgusting joke. Any director who uses sex and nudity pointlessly to get people interested is disappointing to me and it was a shame because this director is excellent usually.<br/><br/>I saw the redux version, but i have heard that the original is much better. Yet, i was so disappointed since this film was so hyped up i shall not be seeing the original.<br/><br/>If you want to waste 191 minutes of your lives, watch this crap."

Both are long, overdone, and not very good. This movie's first half hour is good, with several interesting characters, such as Robert Duvall with one of the most memorable lines in movie history (I LOVE the smell of Napalm in the morning!). After that, however...It just keeps going, and as they float lazily down the river, we grow steadily more and more bored. By the time we finally meet Marlon Brando's renegade antagonist, it's hard to bring yourself to care anymore; you just want the movie to be over. Maybve I'm crazy, but I am a huge movie buff and I still can't stand to watch this movie again.

","I saw it for the first time over the weekend, and I must say that Marlon's idiotic behavior off screen (showing up not knowing his lines, fat, drunk, and unwilling to cooperate) are totally OBVIOUS in the movie. The whole flow of the movie stalls and his random, incoherent babbling make so little sense that it's all you can do to keep from falling asleep at that point. The close ups and lighting are so different than the rest of the movie that it's obvious something had gone horribly wrong at that point. It's supposed to be a slow decent into madness, but the momentum slams into a brick wall when Marlon appears on screen. Martin Sheen's spectacular performance is overshadowed by Marlon's retarded banter. Even if you liked the movie up to that point (which I did), by the time Marlon is done, you almost forget how great the rest of the movie is and just want to scrape red hot forks across your eyeballs and jam Q-tips through your eardrums so you never have to experience those end scenes again."

","Apocalypse Now was late 60's propaganda presented a decade late. It presents a scenario that existed only in the microcosm and pretends that it represents the macrocosm. The film abounds with technical inaccuracies and improbable dialog. These are faults that it, curiously, shares with its antithesis, The Green Berets. Robert Duval does do an excellent job portraying a character possessed of all of the worst qualities an officer could have. There is absolutely no way anyone could reach the rank of colonel with such a personality. The sadness is that far too many think that those portrayed were typical of the US troops in Vietnam. In actuality such characters were infrequent aberrations. Even a far better Vietnam movie, Platoon, presented the same misconceptions.<br/><br/>In summary, it's a shame that so much time and money was wasted on this movie."

"Asphyxiod","5","3","9","24 September 2005"," Lacked Horror !!
","Apocalypse Now is a very good story. But unfortunately Francis Ford Copploa Could not establish the quality of ""Gripping & Free Flowing Story telling"" which was an excellence in The Godfather. Instead he turns up in a slightly loose, mediocre presentation & inconsistent screenplay.<br/><br/>The Central Plot of the Movie is a Dcoumentation of the Vietnam War & the War's relative impact on various soldiers which distorted their ideologies. Vietnam war probably was the deadliest approach of USA's 60's Bureaucracy on the basis on Human Grounds. The Vietnam War shall be remembered in the American History's Blackest Pages which reminds them the loss of lives & Integrity during that Period, out of which, finally they earned nothing.<br/><br/>A Bureaucratic Hunger for Captivation of Global Power, Unscrupulous American Intelligence & Cold War on Communism switched on the the US's indulgence in Vietnam & took them to the longest war which at end outcomed in frustrations & metal terror. Anything said about Vietnam War is always less.<br/><br/>The Facts of Horror : Apocalypse Now failed in actually documenting the Horror of the War which it relates at the end. All American citizens know about the calamities but what happens when a foreigner watches this Movie ? he is question marked ???. Platoon was probably the finest Vietnam War Epic ever made.<br/><br/>The Movie is a Story about Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who is given a Mission to assassinate Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who is believed to have refrained from the Army & settled down amongst the local tribes in Combodia near to Vietnam Border. The Film then starts with the Journey of Willard to reach his final destination (Combodia). Willard's adventure through the river takes him to various places & he faces many war events. He is acquainted with the Strategically sound Col. Kilgore, Playboy Playmates, Small time Dealers who exchange stuffs like Magazines & Ciggarettes etc. Within the first 2 Hours of the unedited version encompasses the Late Part of the War & exemplifies the Present situation of the War. The American Soldiers are fighting the Guerilla War for More than six years now & its been now a place, looking for survival. Survival not just from death, but from seclusion, from aggravation, from despair. Its shows us how at many points the war got disorganized. There were no leaders, no coordination and the soldiers were just fighting.<br/><br/>Willard then reaches a place where a Group of French People lived & formed their small family establishment. This is were Copolla creates the Philosophical foundation of the Movie. The First message about the Casualties of War & the Ideologies of War were exhibited, as the French Family Justifies their reason to stay.<br/><br/>Finally after more than 2 hours of the movie, Willard reaches the Place of Kurtz's small empire. The Entry Scene of Marlon Brando & his First Dialogue about Freedom is probably the best part of the Movie. Brando's role of Col. Kurtz is more powerful than his role in The Godfather. He creates a Massive Screen Presence.<br/><br/>The Film finally establishes its Philosophical attribute about Human Kind's Personal Abandonment from reality. Col. Kutz, always a humanitarian personality after being mentally wrecked from the Horrors of War, runs away from reality & finds himself a sublime position... within the tribes... but still is ready to die ! The Philosophical ideas of the Movie is sound, But the Horror which it relates was never shown. The Film cannot succeed as the emotional establishment on audience was never made & much of time was wasted in playmates, unnecessary mediocre conversations & traveling through the river.<br/><br/>Its known fact that Small Villages were destroyed within minutes just on suspicion of enemy's presence. Poor Vietnamese, Women, Children's, Infants suffered horrifically. These Horror cannot be just understood by showing few scenes of Napalm explosion & helicopter Bombing. <br/><br/>The War scenes were not well-directed. The Cinematography was not good. The Over all script was highly inconsistent.<br/><br/>But the Movie got saved by few good scenes & primarily because of Marlon Brando. He is terrific. Go & watch this movie only for Brando. If you have seen Platoon, then you shall understand the Horror in a better way."

","""Heart of Darkness"", the novel for which this movie was based was no picnic. It was boring and quite uneventful until the very end.  The good thing about it was that it was short (the movie is not)  Some of the themes in it are good, but the novel itself is very lacking.  Apocalypse Now can't really decide what it really is. I saw it at film school, I along with many others was not impressed.  It is an action movie at sometimes, then it turns into some sort of half-brained morality pic.  Although some of the lines are good (namely Robert Duvall's Napalm Rant) and the cinematography is superb, the movie dabbles in too much other things to get to its point.  If one wants to really explore Vietnam in cinema, go see Platoon, for Apocalypse Now is too long to be enjoyable and too corny to be real."

","Apocalypse Now is the story of Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who is sent back to the Vietnam War in order to kill General Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has become the leader of a tribe in the Cambodian jungle and has turned into a murderer.<br/><br/>To be honest, I can't understand why this movie is among the top 50 ranked movies of all-time. I had to stop midway through the movie and watch the rest on another day as it lasts for over 3 hours and the plot develops with a very slow pace and eventually tired me off, and this is something that hardly ever happens. It took 2 hours and 30 minutes in the movie to get to Cambodia and track General Kurtz. Although most movies concerning the Cold War era are of great interest to me, Apocalypse Now had me bored to tears. Big round of applauds though to Martin Sheen for an incredible acting performance."
"bkoganbing","8","2","5","12 November 2016"," The horror, The horror
","We have to wait until there is only a quarter of the running time left before Marlon Brando comes on as Colonel Kurtz. But it's worth the wait to see him give a fabulous performance as a decorated US Army Colonel who has gone over the hill and off the deep end.<br/><br/>Until that time we watch Martin Sheen as an intelligence officer given an assassination assignment to terminate Brando. Brando as a soldier did his job well, too well maybe. Now he's set himself up with an army of Montagnard tribespeople as some kind of potentate deep in the jungle across into Cambodia where Americans aren't supposed to be in any event.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola gave this film almost a surreal quality, it gets more surreal as the PT boat aka swift boat journeys up river to the Kurtz compound. It starts with the real war enough, but even that is a Sam Peckinpah like violence ballet with Robert Duvall replete with western cavalry hat leading a raid on a Viet Cong stronghold at the river mouth with the strains of Wagner's dance of the Valkyries. Duvall loves his aroma of napalm in the morning.<br/><br/>I liked the river journey when Sheen sets out on that PT boat with the ever present mist over the river. It has Hitchcock like suspense, you never know what they will encounter and neither do they. You also see what war has done to the crew in that kind of atmosphere never knowing when they might meet death with an enemy who doesn't operate in the traditional ways of war.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to see the Redux version with the sequence of Christian Marquand and his plantation. It was cut for length in the original film, but it's worth seeing now. All of those countries used to be called French Indo-China, still remember it on Atlas maps when I was a lad. He's got his manor house there and it's home to him and nobody is going to push him out. An attitude similar to people who followed Ian Smith in Northern Rhodesia when the rest of Africa was shaking off colonialism. I'm glad the scenes have been restored.<br/><br/>Brando is only in briefly, but his performance as the cracker doodle, but perceptive Kurtz is something to see. Also note that Scott Glenn previously sent on Sheen's mission and freelance reporter Dennis Hopper have become Brando acolytes and also standout in their cameos.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is not the best Vietnam War film. My own preference is Casualties Of War. But it's definitely worth a look."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","5","24 February 2015"," More of an experience than a movie
","""Apocalypse Now"" is a 1979 movie by Francis Ford Coppola. 7 years after ""The Godfather"", he reunites with actor Marlon Brando (fat and bald here in his mid-50s), who is really difficult to recognize. He plays a highly decorated soldier, who deserted in Cambodia. However, I felt his part was just too self-indulging. It had ""Give me an Oscar"" written all over it as the final 45 minutes of the film entirely circled around him and everything before as well as he was talked about for pretty much the entire film. However, Brando did not win a single award anywhere for his performance here and the film won Oscars for its cinematography and sound. With the truly big awards, the Academy preferred a family divorce drama that year. The central character in ""Apocalypse Now"", however, is played by Martin Sheen, who shows striking resemblance to his son Charlie in quite a few scenes.<br/><br/>This is probably the most famous anti-war movie of all times. It's in the IMDb top50, but definitely not in my top50. However, I still thought it was a good film. Especially Robert Duvall (Kilgore) succeeds in displaying the insanity of war as he treats combat like a painting, plays classic music to the horrendous scenes and has his guys surfing at the same time. Excellent portrayal. He was the much better Coppola reunion in this movie and the Golden Globe and BAFTA wins were absolutely deserving. And when there is no visual horror...horror (e.g. a severed head or the death of the character played by the very young Laurence Fishburne), we hear people talking about it, for example Kurtz' story on severed children's arms.<br/><br/>The redux version of the movie runs for considerably over 3 hours, about 200 minutes, and I would lie if I said there was not a single moment when it dragged. It did, occasionally, for example when they meet the French guys. I could have done without that part. The cast is pretty spectacular. Apart from everybody I already mentioned, there's also Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford and Frederic Forrest in this movie, all 3 Academy Award nominees themselves. It's an interesting take on soldiers' lives during this difficult time. But apart from all the brutal battle scenes and (during one scene) the unsuccessful longing for leadership, we also see a bunch of playboy bunnies giving the troops some pleasure with their mere presence.<br/><br/>This is a good film, no doubt about it. You may certainly need some knowledge about historical background to fully appreciate it and even then, it is certainly not for everybody, but watching this film can be a great experience. Visually, it's a masterpiece and the cinematography contributes as much to the nightmarish atmosphere and constant fight for survival as does the music, most of all The Doors' ""This is the End""."
"matt-fielding","8","2","5","27 March 2007"," Not to be forgotten...
","Coppola's achievement, while significant, is heavily mitigated by the fact that Apocalypse Now is fundamentally an adaptation of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Many people forget that while Coppola did a great job with the movie, his efforts were made significantly easier by the fact that he was simply changing details from an all-time classic novel, ie the setting - Vietnam for Africa. Even Col. Kurtz has the same name as the character in HoD.<br/><br/>This is all-too-often missed by movie fans. I am a great admirer of the film version and not some kind of cynic who thinks movies butcher novels. However, while I feel that AN has added a great amount to the shelf life of HoD and that it serves as an homage to the original text, I feel that it is Conrad, not Coppola, who deserves the greater credit for the success of AN. Either way, it shows what a fantastic story - and a great exploration of the savagery that is within us all - HoD really is, that it can be adapted in such a way and still remain relevant. Its message, about the heart of darkness that lies within even the most civilised nations, remains as powerful in its new form as in the original print version."
"mentalcritic","10","2","5","17 March 2005"," The standard by which all war films should be judged
","In the 1960s, the Indochine conflict that had been raging for most of the twentieth century finally boiled over into the Vietnam War. America went into this war with a tribal, technologically underdeveloped people, firm in the belief that if they committed enough weaponry and soldiers to the battle, the conflict could be won quickly. Obviously, they were wrong, and one of the many things that Apocalypse Now does brilliantly is illustrate some of the reasons why. One officer of the Viet Cong army, I forget who, told the Americans that they would get tired of the war before the Vietnamese do.<br/><br/>This absolute chaos was reflected in the production of Apocalypse Now. Taking over a year to shoot, and around three years to massage into a shape for release, it has become the definitive war epic, not just for a generation, but for all time. Part of this stems from the fact that it is neither pro-Vietnamese nor pro-American, but simply telling the story of one man's terrible journey, leaving the viewer to make up their own mind what to take from it. This is in spite of a fairly slow, even languid pace, and even the great possibility in the late 1970s that it might never be released at all.<br/><br/>In 2001, Francis Ford Coppola released a new version of his masterpiece, complete with a remixed soundtrack and forty-nine minutes of footage that had not been integrated into the cut when the distributors, getting nervous about the production woes, demanded that Coppola release something to the public. The resulting 153-minute cut was hailed as one of the best war films ever made. In spite of this, it did show a little incoherence at times. Scenes seemed to jump from one to another without transition. So the 202-minute Redux addressed this in two ways. First, it obviously added a good deal of footage that gave more development and background to many of the characters, especially Martin Sheen's burned out Captain. It also reorganised existing footage into an order that made somewhat more sense. The scene in which we are introduced to Robert Duvall's insane airborne commander now flows much more smoothly, to cite the best example.<br/><br/>In a much lesser film, it is said that a dream of one war is a dream of all wars. Apocalypse Now is a great expression of this fact. By proxy of a fictional report on the war's progress, we are told in different words that unless we adapt ourselves to our battlefield, victory is impossible. We are also told how technology and manpower alone will not win wars. The film more or less tells us that commitment is far more important in the key to winning a war, and this seems to be a lesson that America is still struggling to learn. If anything, Apocalypse Now is more relevant today than it was in 1979. We are still lying to ourselves, our fearless leaders still lie to us, and we still have the same delusions we call morality.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, Apocalypse Now's signature scene comes early in the piece. The flight of the helicopters over the village to the tune of Wagner's Ride Of The Valkyries is so memorable that the two have literally become one. Many a listener can no longer hear the music without thinking of the film. Unlike many other films, the contemporary music used here also perfectly complements the on screen action. Hearing Jim Morrison sing ""can you picture what will be?"" as helicopter flybys fade into Martin Sheen resting in a Saigon hotel is one thing that convinced me contemporary music could work in films that were not themed around it. Matter of fact, some of the music heard in this film is just as haunting as the story being told. Which is saying quite a lot.<br/><br/>Not only is Apocalypse Now one of the best war films ever made, it is also one of the best adaptations of existing source material ever made. In this case, the film is somewhat loosely based upon the Joseph Conrad novel Heart Of Darkness. Rather than attempt to create a word-for-word adaptation, Coppola transplants the story into what was then a modern setting and embellishes it with all the things that setting allows. As a result, we have something here that stands head and shoulders above other adaptations of novels set in the Vietnam war. Just watch the eerie, surreal bridge sequence here, and compare it with the sniper hunt sequence in the truly abysmal Full Metal Jacket. The difference in quality when a filmmaker is willing to put his health and sanity on the line to capture that authentic feel of a world gone utterly mad. Forget the Windtalkers or Saving Private Ryans, this is as close as one will ever get to live warfare on the screen.<br/><br/>I gave Apocalypse Now a ten out of ten. In spite of flawed editing in its original incarnation, it deserves this rating in both the original and Redux edits. Like RoboCop or X-Men 2, it simply must be preserved as a record of the world's mentality at the time it was made. It is a classic that every storyteller should study intently. You have not truly seen the dark side of humanity until you have seen Apocalypse Now."

"Hancock_the_Superb","5","3","10","20 June 2007"," ""Redux"" is overblown, overlong, and pretentious
","Over the last two years, I have made it my goal to see as many classic movies as possible. I've fallen in love with dozens of great movies, like the films of David Lean, ""The Wind and the Lion"", ""Casablanca"", ""The Godfather Part II"", ""Sunset Boulevard"" - too many too mention. There have been some classics which I've not been entirely satisfied with; I've been slightly disappointed by ""My Fair Lady"", ""Spartacus"", and ""Citizen Kane"", among others. But at least I enjoyed them, and found some merit in them deserving of classic status.<br/><br/>Today, I had a mind-altering experience. I watched ""Apocalypse Now: Redux"", the three-and-a-half hour cut of Francis Ford Coppola's infamous masterpiece of madness and war. And I learned a very valuable lesson which, as I embark on my college term as a Film Studies Major, I will always keep in mind: Not all classic movies are great. Not all classic movies are even good. Some are too long, some are excruciating to watch, some try to hard to be ""deep"" and ""meaningful"" when in reality they're just a pile of pretentious pooh. And then, some movies add an hour of footage to an already long movie and make it agonizingly slow-paced. ""Apocalypse Now: Redux"" is one of these; it's a movie that starts off interesting, has flashes of genius, and then, at about the two hour mark, begins a long, slow decline in entertainment value and seemed to be begging for us to accept it as a great movie. Well, sorry, but you don't get an A just for trying.<br/><br/>Based on Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", the film concerns Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), a burned-out Special Forces officer who is sent on a suicide mission up a river into Cambodia, to assassinate the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), now fighting his own private war with an army of Montagnard tribesmen who worship him as a demi-god. As Willard and his companions go further up-river, they find their mission descending further into madness and depravity. By the time he finally reaches Kurtz's camp, Willard is forced to confront his own perceptions of war and morality.<br/><br/>It boggles my mind to think how this movie is considered THE definitive Vietnam movie. It is not about the Vietnam War, any more than ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is about World War II. Most of the movie, despite all the period details, could take place at any time, any place. This is not, in and of itself, a bad thing, and to be fair, the film does have some intriguing analysis of the Vietnam War and the US involvement there. But it's not the point; in essence, the movie is just some guys looking for a crazy guy hiding out in the jungle.<br/><br/>Perhaps the movie's biggest flaw is in its characters. None of the characters are one bit sympathetic. Willard and his crew are pretty much caricatures of Vietnam soldiers - burned-out, half-crazed drug addicted war criminals. Anyone who thinks that these are accurate characterizations of Vietnam soldiers gets their perception of the War entirely from movies like this. Whatever valid points are made about the futility of the war, and about the cruelty of human nature in general, are largely drowned by these two-dimensional characters who ""bug out"" at the slightest provocation. It's difficult to care what happens to any of them, and made worse that some of them are downright unlikable. The very young Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne) and the spaced-out Lance (Sam Bottoms) are particularly annoying; I kept waiting for the latter to get knocked off, and I would have been relieved if he had.<br/><br/>The film does contain some extremely memorable scenes, and in terms of direction, cinematography, and editing, it is brilliant. The helicopter attack scene with Robert Duvall's Colonel Kilgore, the confrontation with an unarmed sampan, the tiger sequence - all are brilliantly done set pieces. But the film also contains a lot of superfluous, digressive nonsense, namely the Playboy Bunny scenes and the unnecessary and ridiculously long scenes at the French plantation. These scenes ruin the pacing and help sabotage the fairly effective set-up, which had promised great things. The film is finally done in by the ridiculously overlong and overdone ending at Kurtz's compound. Marlon Brando's pontifications about the horrors of war are neither original nor insightful, and after all we've seen, it's hard to be anything but numb to his ramblings by this point.<br/><br/>Nor are the performances anything to write home about. Martin Sheen does an excellent job with a two-dimensional character who has little real depth, but otherwise, a fine cast is largely wasted. Marlon Brando's performance consists of mumbling T.S. Eliot and condemnations of war with shadow on his face - not exactly up to Terry Malloy or Vito Corleone. Dennis Hopper's journalist is very annoying, and at any rate introduced far too late to be of any importance. Robert Duvall, while also a caricature, is perhaps the most memorable and amusing character of the film. The rest of the cast - Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Albert Hall, Frederic Forrest, G.D. Spralin, Harrison Ford - are simply ciphers who fade into the jungle.<br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" may have been an obsessive labor of love for Francis Ford Coppola, John Milius, and Co.; it may be a technically brilliant film; it may be significant; it may have entertaining moments; it may even have some pertinent things to say about human nature in general and the Vietnam War in particular. But it is not, in my opinion, a great film. Poorly paced, largely incoherent, and very distant, ""Apocalypse Now"" set me up for a great film in the first two hours and then left me high and dry as it slowly lumbered towards an atrocious conclusion. Call me a philistine or uncultured, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it.<br/><br/>""The Horror"", indeed.<br/><br/>5/10"

","When I hear people say that this was the best film about Vietnam ever, I have to puke, I mean laugh. This was a boring, unrealistic, slow ride to nowhere. I am aware that it is based on ""Heart of Darkness"", but you know what? That was a boring, pointless book as well. I know there are messages all over the movie and the expense of this film must have been incredible. And yes, Duval makes me laugh. But the bad just far outweighs the good here. This movie is a mess. From a movie I seek one of two things, interest or excitement. This had neither. Is that to say that there are no interesting or exciting scenes? No, there are, but the boring, pointless scenes just outweigh them by so much. For a realistic look at Vietnam, I would suggest ""Platoon"" or ""Full Metal Jacket."" For a far out movie that has interest, I would suggest ""Easy Rider"" or ""A Clockwork Orange."" However, if you want to be bored and see some of the silliest war scenes ever, try this one.

"eelen-seth","8","3","11","23 July 2019"," The version Coppola always wanted to make
","I'm going to be honest here for a second and let you know, I've never watched the original. Watching Apocalypse Now: Final Cut - the version director Francis Ford Coppola always wanted to make - seemed to be a great opportunity for me to experience this classic on the big screen.<br/><br/>This year marks the 40th anniversary of Apocalypse Now. Rereleased in 2001 as 'Redux'-version, 'Final Cut' cuts down to a three hour running time and uses state-of-the-art Dolby Atmos sound and crystal clear 4k restored imagery. Every scene got polished and feels and looks like a new film. Coppola seems to be saying goodbye to his magnum opus with this final cut, showing us exactly the way he wanted Apocalypse Now to look like in the first place.<br/><br/>The opening shot of palm trees turning into ashes, to the sound of The Doors' ""The End"" is burned into my mind. Just beautiful in every way. This image might not look as hi-def as you'd hope for in the final cut, but this has to do with the way it was shot on celluloid. Nonetheless, gives you an idea what awaits you. Helicopters and motel-room ceiling fans edited in a way that it overlaps, shows how affected Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is by this war - PTSD shown in the most artistic way.<br/><br/>Where the first two acts are really compelling, the final act really lost me. The first two acts explore post traumatic stress syndrome and the challenges that come with it. The Vietnam war is still roaring in the background, but our main group of characters is put on a side mission upriver, to hunt down a deserter - demented colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). The Captain reads through Kurtz's files while traveling through Vietnam, danger luring around every corner and trying not to lose focus on his goal. This war changed many men forever. Coppola and his team show the insanity in the jungle and trenches, while these soldiers have nothing else to lose than their minds.<br/><br/>The final act starts with a very strange scene at a plantation that has nothing to add to the story. Here we get seated around a dinner table with French colonialists discussing politics, that seems to go on forever. To then move further down the river to introduce Brando's character in a cultish way. This third act feels like a different film and to me was very anti-climactic. That doesn't mean this film isn't a masterpiece, because the work and practical effects put into the making of this is simply astonishing. Watching Robert Duvall act for his life, was jaw-dropping and made me smile every time he appeared on screen.<br/><br/>I've never seen anything like Apocalypse Now: Final Cut before, and I don't think I'll ever see anything like this ever again. StudioCanal decided to distribute this new version in Australia. If you get the chance to watch this on the big screen from Thursday July 25 (in selected cinemas), please do, you won't regret it!"

","Apocalypse Now is not your average Vietnam war film. It isn't about all the politics behind the war, it focuses on the individuals in the war.

However, you can't deny it's a wonder of filmmaking."
"screenman","5","2","6","10 March 2011"," Apocalypse Then
","Viewed in retrospect, Coppola's ambitious, sprawling, statement on the Vietnam war, has the appearance of a crack-smoker's nightmare. It certainly doesn't live up to the hype of yesteryear.<br/><br/>The intro is now surely one of the most boring in movie history, depicting what appears to be a dream sequence in the hero's head as the credits come and go. Youthful Martin Sheen is Captain Willard, wishing he was back in the war. Alternately we glimpse a montage of helicopters and pyrotechnics, interspaced by images of his troubled, staring eyes. It's over-long. Already I'm impatient.<br/><br/>We eventually learn that he has been selected for a mission to assassinate some rogue Colonel. So; off he goes.<br/><br/>The core of the movie takes us through a fairly typical series of set-piece 'Nam clichés. Contempt for authority, loss of mission belief, disobedience, paranoia, psychosis, military blundering, slaughter of the innocents, disconnected officers; all the recurrent themes of the genre are addressed with a suitably heavy hand. If US forces really are so dysfunctional; it's hardly surprising that they lost. For much of the time Sheen's voice narrates his thoughts about the mission, its renegade target, and the world about him. That also is the stuff of cliché.<br/><br/>None of the characters excite our particular sympathy. They are all largely 2-dimensional; their inclusion simply fits a predetermined scenario. And when they die, we don't really care. Even Sheen's Willard is coldly unappealing.<br/><br/>Eventually, after yet more set-piece - and frankly ridiculous phantasmagoria - we are face to face with Colonel Kurtz: Willard's nemesis. This character is 'played' by Marlon Brando, who was already a fast-fading legend. We only ever see him in half-light because he was, by now, and quite rightly, so self-conscious about his appearance that it was a condition of his involvement in the movie. He babbles slowly and incoherently as lunatics are apt to do. The encounter is such a darkly plodding and tedious experience that it's almost a book-end to the beginning. Eventually, the deed is done and it's time to go.<br/><br/>Accolades were heaped upon this movie. Perhaps in its day they were deserved. I think they had more to do with the inclusion of that Lord God Of Stardom (read preposterous fat clown) Brando, than anything else. He had already assumed such a cult status, almost any movie in which he featured was deemed to be a classic. But fans who remember that hungry young cannibal on the waterfront, will find him a contender for nothing more than 'Booby of The Year' in this production.<br/><br/>It is sumptuously filmed in vibrant colour and has a stellar cast who pop up and vanish like gooks, including a make-tea-and-miss Harrison Ford just 2 years after a dominant role in 'Star Wars'. The script is likewise below par. That so-oft-repeated 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' courtesy of a fleeting Robert Duvall is memorable for no other reason than being the only line worth quoting.<br/><br/>If you're high on something at time of viewing then you may connect with the imagery and 'message', but by any sober evaluation, it's meandering, over-blown and pompous. Not recommended. I actually gave more points to John Wayne's uber-simplistic but at least coherent 'Green Berets'."
"moonspinner55","6","2","6","9 February 2008"," ""A snail on the edge of a straight razor...""
","Francis Ford Coppola's vision of Vietnam, seeing the eccentricities inherent in the horrors of war and also the indescribable visual beauty running rampant through all the ugliness. Martin Sheen plays an Army Captain whose been traumatized by his first duty in Saigon; but, left without a family and haunted by memories of the jungles, he is almost anxious to accept a new mission: track down and kill a renegade Green Beret Colonel, a poetic martinet who has apparently lost his mind, hiding out in the ""heart of darkness"". Elephantine production quickly gets out of hand, and Sheen seems to struggle with his wobbly, mushy character (he's rudderless throughout, acting mostly with his wide eyes). The locations and the rock music selections are all impeccable, stamping this time and place with a distinctive (and artistic) mark, but Coppola loses his identity somewhere along this unseemly journey. ""Apocalypse Now"" has the look of genius--genius coming from a salty, veteran filmmaker--but it could be a picture directed by any number of brazen auteurs. Some incredible supporting performances (by Marlon Brando, as well as Robert Duvall, Sam Bottoms, Dennis Hopper--who just evaporates--and Frederic Forrest) give the proceedings some muscle, but it's a wayward and occasionally woebegone film, throwing punches like a boxer in the dark. **1/2 from ****"
"JoeytheBrit","Null","2","6","20 November 2005"," Coppola and Milius: The Hollow Men
","Apocalypse Now is a film about madness, about its attendant chaos and about the many forms it takes at a time when the (American) world and war has gone awry. It's not an easy film to watch and, unless I have seriously misunderstood the intentions of the filmmakers, it is neither successful nor the masterpiece so many claim it to be. The themes of madness and chaos in this film could also, it seems, be applied to both its making and the inexplicable reactions it has provoked <br/><br/>Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness, inspired also by T. S. Eliot's darkest works, and containing an implicit suggestion that established narrative structure cannot adequately describe the darkness of man's soul in the modern world, the impression is that Coppola fully succeeded in achieving everything he set out to achieve: a thinking man's take on the collective madness that engulfed the US hierarchy and destroyed a generation of its young men. Trouble is, Coppola was making movies while they were fighting, and co-writer John Milius's chronic asthma prevented him from military service, so that what we have here is a philosophical study that lacks the necessary component of personal experience  and it shows. While that doesn't make Coppola and Milius's view any less valid, the self-indulgent nature of some of the passages becomes unacceptable. Sheen's narration sounds like something out of a cheap pulp fiction novel at times and, when you get right down to it, all we have here is the same message being hammered into our brains over and over and over again.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that fuses art with populism so, between all those long sequences in which Coppola focuses on mythic narrative and dwells on its place and purpose in the midst of a brutal war, we get to see surfing soldiers and crowd-pleasing helicopter attacks played out to the thundering strains of the Ride of the Valkyrie, and sex-starved soldiers rioting over a trio of gyrating Playboy bunnies. Apocalypse Now is a self-perpetuating legend whose reputation, like the war it depicts, has grown out of control."
"dpenzel","6","2","6","17 May 2005"," A movie that asks one question...
","The one question that ""Apocalypse Now"" should leave in the minds of everyone who sees it is ""Why was this movie ever made?"". For starters, it is a direct lift from Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", which is a short story that makes its points briefly and without fuss. It proposes to examine the disaster that was the Vietnam war, but takes forever to make its points, and then makes them with a bludgeon. It is a collection of setpieces and lacks a natural feel. It also features the worst performance Marlon Brando ever turned in. From the moment he appears on the screen he affects the movie the way a rotting whale carcass washed ashore affects a beach party. I missed the opening credits the first time I saw it and was shocked at the end to see that Harrison Ford had been in it. And for a final over-made point, listen to the code word Martin Sheen uses to call in the airstrike. That is not to say that there aren't some good things in it. The Philippine scenery was used well. Frederick Forrest was as good as he can be, and that little scene with the tiger is a gem. Robet Duvall was excellent, and the helicopter assault is one of the best flying sequences ever filmed, a real triumph of editing. My own recommendation is that even if it is pretentious and overblown, it is still worth seeing - a superb failure."

"frankde-jong","7","1","2","30 December 2019"," The last masterpiece of Francis Ford Coppola
","""Apocalypse now"" is a film with a great reputation and a big influence. Many people know the sentence ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"" without ever having seen the film. This reputation is partly due to the production history (a hell in itself) and the financing (Coppola financed the film himself and put the entire capital he had earned with the ""Godfather"" films at stake). A diffucult production history however does not make in itself a good film.<br/><br/>""Apocalypse now"" has many facets, but in my opinion this is more a weakness then a strength of the movie.
As a Vietnam movie it is (in my opinion) surpassed by ""The deer hunter"" (1978, Michael Cimino).
You may object that ""Apocalypse now"" is not a pure Vietnam film and that the book on which it is based (""Heart of darkness"", 1899, Joseph Conrad) is situated in Africa. True, ""Apocalypse now"" is also an odyssey with a river as a metaphor, but also in this category I can think of a better movie (""The night of the hunter"", 1955, Charles Laughton). Well done is the cinematography of Vittorio Storaro who makes the movie darker when it progresses.
In the third place the movie is about sinking into madness, but in this respect I can refer to a film like ""Aguire, der Zorn Gottes"" (1972, Werner Herzog). By the way some characters are already very mad at the beginning of the fim (e.g. colonel Kilgore), it only makes one more curious after the madness of colonel Kurz and if this is the only reason why the US army is so interested in him?
Last but not least the film is about pagan religion. At the end of the film the book ""The golden bough, a study in magic and religion"" (1890, J.G. Frazer) appears briefly on the screen. In this facet the movie outperforms a movie like ""The wicker man"" (1973, Robin Hardy), but that is not a very hard thing to do. Regarding this respect I admired the brilliant close ups of the face of Marlon Brando very much. It was a bit of a disappointment to learn that one of the functions of these close ups was to keep his big belly of the screen.<br/><br/>Above I criticized the film as a whole. The film however contains a couple of scenes that are indeed brilliant. Below I shall mention the scenes that striked me the most. ""Apocalypse now"" has been released in three different versions (Original (1979), Redux (2001) and Final cut (2019)). This was possible because Coppola (as mentioned earlier) had financed the film himself, and was thus owner of the copyrights. Not al the critical scenes appear in all versions.<br/><br/>
The most well known scene is without any doubt the helicopter-attack on the Vietnamese village with the ""Ride of the Walkure"" music. The fact that Walkures take dead war heroes to Walhalla but do not kill them theselves makes the scene no less effective. ""Apocalypse now"" is also the film (together with the popsong ""Good night Saigon"" from Billy Joel) that makes the association between helicopters and the Vietnam war the most explicit (also ""The Doors"" are mentioned in both film and song). What amazes me the most in this scene is that it really is beautiful when one sees the helicopters take off. The horror strikes only when the camera cuts to a Vietnamese schoolyard with playing children.<br/><br/>
Also worth mentioning is the scene where all of the inhabitants of a Sampan are killed, just because a 17 years old American boy from the Bronx (that we have come to know as rather sympathetic) loses control of his nerves.<br/><br/>
A second scene with the playmates was introduced in the redux version and again skipped in the final cut. The reason was that it would be too woman unfriendly, which is true. The remaining scene with the playmates is really revealing. Isn't it male unfriendly to sexually arouse adolescent boys so much that they forget that they are only cannon feed?<br/><br/>
The final scene I would like to draw your attention to is the scene on the French plantation (only in the redux and final cut). Some find this scene to slow, others interpret the French inhabitants of the plantation as ghosts but I would like to draw your intention to the following quote of the French padre familias (ghost or human):<br/><br/>
""We want to stay here because it's ours - it belongs to us. It keeps our family together. I mean, we fought for that. While you Americans... you are fighting for the biggest nothing in history!""<br/><br/>In Vietnam the Americans confused a north-south conflict for an east - west coflict. They fought for the biggest nothing indeed."

","I just watched the Final Cut and it looked and sounded great! But I saw the Redux version 20 years ago and was hoping Coppola would have listened to the critics and removed that plantation scene. Alas, it's still in there, in the final cut. It's the one major flaw in his revisions of his film. I feel the original theatrical cut got it right. The pacing was perfect, and it just kept the build up going. But this nagging french plantation, while interesting, so very out of place. It stops the movie dead in its tracks for a good 20 minutes. I kind of understand why Coppola wants it in there, because they give a bit of a history lesson on how things came about in the Vietnam conflict, with the french being the original colonialists. But the movie, the way I see it, is bigger than just the conflict. While it's set in Vietnam, it wasn't specifically anti-vietnam war. It was more like anti-war in general, and anti-colonialism, like the book. But by doing the history lesson in the plantation scene, it kind of ruins the metaphorical aspect of the film.
Anyway, that's my rant on that scene. It's a wonderful film to watch, at least I know the aforementioned scene is a good spot to go for a bathroom break!"

","I was born in the XXI century and do, naturally, have a clip thinking that does not welcome long preludes for something.That's why I started my exploration of Francis Ford Coppola's art works by this very film, considered by many to be the highest peak of his mastery, moreover, I managed to watch its extended version because of the 40-year jubilee. Well, as I was looking at the final titles, I could not more see the life the way I used to. I felt as if my head had been hit with something massive. Genuinely did I have some kind of a hangover: a terrible headache, a slight feeling of being sick and - the pain whenever I tried to think about the film, it's meaning and message.<br/><br/>However, the pain leaves, but your thoughts stay. What was the film about? The essence of war? The new perception of the one that was in Vietnam? Maybe about the concept of the Übermensch in the named realities? I can not know. All I know is that it scared me to death and made me wonder, reflect and sink in questions.<br/><br/>I will not speak of the excellent acting or soundtrack, which are nevertheless notable. Without any doubt, there were enough people to talk about this. But I can't not point out the operator work. I dare to suppose that it is these long scenes, that some of the reviewers called unnecessary, that actually make the film so utterly beautiful as long as cruel and horrifying. The film has its own poetry. Combined with a controversial topic and a meaningful storyline, you get a masterpiece. In my opinion, watching ""Apocalypse Now"" is like a marathon: after you have just finished it you can't believe you've done that, you think you are going to die and will not ever be able to do that again. But as the time goes by, you're starting to see the charm and the hidden depths. And you do.<br/><br/>I strongly advise you not to watch the movie alone and at home, with children or family. It will not reward you if you're looking for something light and fun. It will not give you a clue to itself.

","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠<br/><br/>Coppola's megalomania, Brando's behaviour, Sheen's heart attack - all of the behind the scenes stuff, 'add' rather than distract to the overall viewing experience of 'Apocalypse Now'.<br/><br/>Terrifying, brutal, experimental and an effective expressionistic War film masterpiece. A stunning piece of art and a filmmaker's apocalypse getting it made.<br/><br/>Coppola kept shooting and shooting and shooting, accumulating miles and miles of exposed footage without knowing precisely what story he wanted to tell or how he wanted to end it. Back in the bad old days Coppola claims in press notes for the new and improved Apocalypse Now Redux - 'We were terrified that the film was too long, too strange and didn't resolve itself in a kind of classical big battle at the end... 22 years ago I was under more pressure to make this into what was then considered a 'normal' war film. Now I have the opportunity to widen the focus.'<br/><br/>Coppola was required by the Philippine government to destroy the Kurtz compound after he was finished shooting. He photographed it being blown up and decided to use this footage over his closing 35 MM credits. The destruction of the compound was later confused as an alternative ending to the film.<br/><br/>It is well-known by now that the making of Apocalypse Now was fraught with trauma. Sheen had a heart attack, the Philippine locations were politically and meteorologically unstable and Coppola was reportedly in a paranoid coke frenzy to name a few. Somehow it only makes the grandiosity of the end result all the more impressive.<br/><br/>George Lucas was originally set to direct Apocalypse Now based on a screenplay by John Milius. Lucas's initial plan was to shoot the movie as a faux-documentary on location in South Vietnam while the war was still in progress. Coppola who was to be the executive producer tried to get the film made as part of a production deal with Warner Bros. but the deal fell through and Coppola went on to direct The Godfather (1972). By the time both men had enough clout to get the film made, Saigon had fallen and Lucas was making Star Wars (1977). Milius had no interest in directing the film and Lucas gave Coppola his blessing to direct the film himself.<br/><br/>Originally scheduled to be shot over six weeks, the filming ended up taking 16 months. The cow slaughter in the climactic scene is real. According to the editor Walter Murch, it took nearly 2 years to edit the movie with an average of less than one cut per day.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now can be either seen as a stunning work of cinema - or a mixed bag of raw excess and ambition.<br/><br/>HATCHED IN AGONY AND REDEEMED BY RECKLESS SHARDS OF CINEMATIC BRILLIANCE."

The violence could have been more powerful and gritty, but that's not what Coppola wanted, he wanted to show the horror of war by depicting it as an annoying and irritating experience. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie could have been way better. There are many sub-plots that could have been used in a way that adds to the main plot by emphasizes on the moral dilemma of the movie.

"lukeremail15","10","1","2","26 May 2017"," A masterpiece of epic proportions
","In short, Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is one of the few movies ever made that can truly be called a masterpiece. Fantastic acting, and unmatched direction both go into making this film a cinema classic. ""Apocalypse Now"" is considered to be of the war movie genre, however after watching "" Hearts of Darkness"" you can see the story is more about finding ones true self amidst the backdrop of a crazy war. This film is perhaps the finest work of direction and cinematography ever created. Unlike most movies made in the 70s it still holds up today. In closing this movie is an unmatched accomplishment that will inspire awe in viewers for many years to follow."

"filipemanuelneto","8","1","2","9 February 2017"," A dystopian criticism against all wars.
","Francis Ford Coppola played the sorcerer's apprentice in this movie but, contrary to what happened with the legendary apprentice, the magic went very well. But this film is not about reality or the real Vietnam War. We may regard it as a parody or a joke, but I think its deeper than that, its a statement of the director's opinion regarding the war, in particular Vietnam. And Coppola's statement is crystal clear: war was a total disaster where thousands of Americans died in vain and any war is always the apocalypse. Coppola wanted to give the public a view of this through this movies and we can prove this not only by the shocking graphic violence that punctuates it but also by the dystopic form as the conflict is portrayed and narrated. This way of facing the war is also evident in some of the dialogues. Its as if the war transformed the human being into the worst and raw of the animals, according to Coppola's mind. At first, the film was largely softened with various cuts but, recently, a DVD with an extended version appeared on the market. I understand the reasons: at the time, Vietnam was a hot topic, Coppola wanted to raise awareness and show what he thought about it but he might not want to hurt social morality. But today things are different. The scenes with the Playboy bunnies, however, seem to be left in the film, though they look as animalistic as the soldiers, as if they were objects and not real women.<br/><br/>The film features an extraordinary Marlon Brando (for me, it is his best film after ""The Godfather"") and a good Martin Sheen, alongside Robert Duvall (who would specialize in action films and hard characters), Laurence Fishburne , Harrison Ford (still far from stardom), Dennis Hopper and Scott Glenn. All the actors have been quite well. The film has a constantly very heavy environment and the combat scenes were filmed quite realistically. I know some older people who have been at war (not in Vietnam but in Portuguese Africa) and cannot stand it because they feel again at war and awakens traumatic memories. So I'll leave the warning: if you cannot handle violent movies, if you're sensitive, suggestible or underage, do not watch this movie. Giving good advice never hurts, does it?"
"aahari5","10","1","2","20 July 2014"," The Horror... The Horror...
","Apocalypse Now is director Francis Ford Coppola's best film, dare I say even better than The Godfather in a very close victory. The film is a harrowing and mesmerizing tale of the slow descent into madness and the effects that war can have on one's mind, and it also has the absolute best cinematography that I have ever seen. It is a film that has held its own despite a hellish production and it has become a masterpiece of its time.<br/><br/>The production of Apocalypse Now is well known to have been a complete nightmare, with such problems that included Marlon Brando's uncooperative demeanor and weight problems, Martin Sheen's near-fatal heart attack, sets being destroyed by multiple storms, and ever increasing production costs. Production took well over a year to complete and millions of feet of film were edited down to the final product. Despite all of these setbacks, however, the end result is a wonder to behold. The story is uncompromising and harsh and we the viewers can feel Captain Willard's grip on reality slowly fade away as he carries out his journey to find Colonel Kurtz. The masterful cinematography makes the nearly-four-decade old film look and feel brand new. Coppola truly suffered for his craft, but the end result was well worth all the trouble.<br/><br/>The film's antagonist, Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, is a very intriguing character despite his short time actually on screen. He is a highly regarded and honored military figure who has gone mad and formed his own kingdom of sorts in the jungles of Cambodia. He has become so powerful that he is even feared by the US military. When we are finally introduced to Kurtz, we learn that the horrors he witnessed and experienced during his time fighting in the war are what created his grim views on human nature and civilization. Kurtz has an almost god-like air about him. The way that he operates and commands his militia throughout the film without his physical presence gives him a mysterious yet powerful quality that make the character feel omnipresent. His back story and his influence over the lead characters even before they come to meet him creates the impression that he is somehow watching and controlling their every move and thoughts and that by the time they finally reach him, he already has some control and insight into their minds. Kurtz is one of the most interesting characters on film that I have yet seen.<br/><br/>Overall, Apocalypse Now is truly unforgettable and is one of my favorite films. The philosophical messages of insanity and man's breaking point haunt the viewer for some time, perhaps forever. This is a film that has to be seen to be believed."

","Watching Apocalypse Now by Francis Ford Coppola was a thought-provoking experience. The movie's plot is simple: During the Vietnam War, Captain Benjamin Willard is sent to go after Colonel Kurtz, who left the war and established his own civilization. I'm going to leave it there and not give any more details. <br/><br/>When I first watched this movie, I was amazed buy Vittorio Storaro's(The Cinematographer) use of the camera and colors. In 2001, when Coppola presented Apocalypse Now Redux(an extended version of the film) at the Cannes Film Festival, he said, ""This film is not about the Vietnam War, It is Vietnam!"". I agree, I felt like I was there with Martin Sheen and experiencing what he was.<br/><br/>I have to say that Robert Duvall's and Marlon Brando's Performances in the film as Kilgore and Kurtz were the best roles of their careers!<br/><br/>WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
"johntrenchcrowe","9","1","2","10 May 2014"," Cinematic Perfection
","Apocalypse Now is absolute perfection. It is the story of Captain Willard, who is sent into Cambodia to execute a rogue colonel, and faces the insanity of the 'Nam war, and the hypocrisy of western imperialism. We follow Willard, as he travels down the fictional Nung, falling deeper into the rabbit hole.<br/><br/>It is a fantastic performance from Sheen, he creates a three dimensional character that just seems to be on the verge of insanity himself, never really in control of the situation, a pawn on the chessboard controlled by the hierarchy of the US military.<br/><br/>He travels into the depths of Cambodia, where he meets his target, Kurtz, played brilliantly and terrifyingly by Brando. Kurtz is truly one of the most intimidating characters in all of film history, almost radiating with lunacy, looming over Willard.<br/><br/>A winding odyssey down the Nung River that leaves the audience emotionally and physically exhausted, it's the only film to make me feel so fully engrossed, felt like I was on the damn boat. A chilling performance from Brando, fantastic cinematography, and a great take on the mania of war. Plus, the best opening scene in film history."
"petarmatic","8","1","2","30 April 2014"," Watching it again, it does not loose its outstanding quality.
","When I saw this film for the first time when I was a teenager I was amazed with its quality and a message it wanted to share with the world. Message was: No one can stay unbruised by war. PTSD comes in various ways and it really keeps human being who is sick of it as a living corps. This was well portrayed in the character of the colonel played so well by Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is outstanding, from cinematography to action and plot together with interesting voodoo tribes and portrayal of the Vietnames jungle.<br/><br/>A lot of things had been said about this film, and I just can add my humble prise to it.<br/><br/>It is a must see, just as all the classics are a must see. This is one of those classics."
"zachlong-400-148221","10","1","2","7 April 2014"," Cinema at its Most Daring
","5/5 Apocalypse Now is one of the few movies about war that doesn't focus on the bloodshed it causes. It is an example of an audacious film that takes us in its dark universe and never lets us see the light.<br/><br/>The film is centered around the folly of man's sanity. It shows how some people's lives are centered around war and they believe it's their burden to only be in war. After witnessing one of the most brilliant opening titles ever, we cut to our center character, played by Martin Sheen who says ""Saigon...s***. I was still only in Saigon.Every time I think I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle. When I was home after my first tour it was worse. I'd wake up and there'd be nothing. I hardly said a word to my wife until I said yes to a divorce. When I was here I wanted to be there."" There as nothing left for him, but war. There are many symbolisms with the other two main roles RObert Duvall and Marlon Brando who gives a haunting performance.<br/><br/>The visuals in the film were also stunning, trying to sink us into the dark atmosphere. The very beginning with the credits shows a jungle getting destroyed by helicopters and the Doors hit The End playing hauntingly in the background. The battle scenes are greatly set and shot and are extremely realistic, even more realistic for some of today's standards. <br/><br/>This is probably my all time favorite films.Many have loved it, and many have hated it, I would say definitely check it out. Its not a film based on the brutality of war, but how war affects us to go to measures that play with our sanity. There are violent scenes, but really focus on the soldiers, especially Robert Duvall's character, how he reacts to war. Apocalypse Now is probably the greatest war movie ever and simply put as one of the greatest ever made. It a dark, haunting, visionary, and surprisingly accurate meditation on human nature."
"giancalvo98","10","1","2","18 March 2014"," A Classic
","This movie is spectacular. It has a very basic storyline, good guy turn bad, new guy kill old bad guy. It's not that simple however, being that Sheen's character begins to question his command and start to go insane. The characters, although some are forgettable, are outstandingly iconic. Robert Duvall's performance as a bad-ass Colonel is extremely memorable, and Marlon Brando's portrayal of the main ""antagonist"" Kurtz is phenomenal. The soundtrack is also superb, using classic 60's-70's songs like ""The End"" and ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" but the truly memorable song is ""Ride Of The Valkyries"". However I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone looking for an action intensive flick or a Full Metal Jacket-esque film. There is plenty of action in the film but it's main focus is the progression of Ben Willard (Sheen) in his reaching Kurtz (Brando). It is VERY slow at some points where we hear Willard's inner thoughts as he reads Kurtz's files. All in all it is the one of the most classic war movies and movies in general."
"phobonnika","10","1","2","11 February 2014"," The 11th greatest film of all time.
","What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? During the Vietnam War, Captain Willard is sent on a covert and dangerous mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade colonel who has set himself up as a god among a local tribe. Perhaps the problem that people have with Apocalypse Now is that they take it as a serious war film. I can't think of a genuinely serious American war film that could be considered a masterpiece, yet Coppola's proof that his top-running 1972 contender for the 'perfect movie' consensus could be made more perfect in every aspect: Apocalypse Now, is undeniably a masterpiece. So as logic stands, we must rethink what Apocalypse Now is generally assumed to be. Despite being one of the most well known and iconic films on the list, such a bright spotlight does not detract from its majesty. The opening scene to any film is always an indication of the shape of things to come, and Apocalypse Now benefits from one of the most stark, minimalistic sequences of intense pulchritude ever to be directed. What follows is both startling and balming. With a velvety narrative for company that relaxes for the most part yet still reminds us from time to time that what its discussing has the potential to be very upsetting, we are taken through a journey of immense significance to the world of cinema. It might not be a proper, thoroughbred war that the journey brings you through, but it is certainly one of startlingly beautiful decadence, torment and discovery. Just watch Captain Willard's (Martin Sheen) development and how he comes to terms with the task at hand as the jungle setting, filmed in such an aspect ratio to bring out its full potential of mystery and danger, rolls by in the background, and inhale and exhale. Of course, Apocalypse Now isn't just pretty to look at. It contains some of the most classic scenes of all time, above all the popular culture's all-time favourite of the strikingly bold attack on the Viet-Cong outpost in a fleet of helicopters beaming Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"". Although this scene is as intense and vivid as cinema can reach, a scene of pure sensation, dazzling audiences with light and noise, laying bare the stark horror - and unimaginable thrill - of combat, it's the arrival at Colonel Kurtz's (Marlon Brando) camp that is the most curved apex of Hollywood's camera-work ever to be pieced together, an audio-visual descent through the threshold of necessary insanity and surrealism with the single plucks of a sentinel double bass to reinforce it. It's a simply staggering piece of American filmmaking. Apocalypse Now isn't so much an important work, a turning point or a revelation about how to make films like the next feature on the list, but it's something that exceeds all prejudices in purely showcasing the depth, finesse and density of simply pleasurable art that celluloid organic matter has been able to create."
"GeorgeRoots","10","1","2","16 November 2013"," An Absolute ""Must-See"" Experience.
","This is my full review of this legendary picture. Whilst the original is a classic, I saw the ""Redux"" first and was blown away by the new material incorporated (Maybe the French plantation stuff still could've been left out). Obviously any film enthusiast can agree that ""Apocalypse Now"" is essentially a film like no other. A tense hallucinogenic, physically exhausting movie which can only be described as part War, and something else entirely towards its conclusion. It is something hard to describe unless you see it, and even then I find the experience hard to put down into words.<br/><br/>One thing I love about this movie is the success it had after going against all odds during production. For those who don't know Brando showed up too overweight, was reportedly very hard to work with and would require a body double during day scenes. Harvey Keitel was replaced by Martin Sheen a few weeks into filming, and Sheen had a heart attack at the age of 36 only to return to work a month later. What would be a 16-week shoot, took over 239 days of sweat & torture. Typhoon Olga destroyed many expensive sets, extras & the crew got malaria and many other diseases. Sam Bottoms (The actor who plays Lance), was constantly on drugs while shooting and Martin Sheen's brother did half of the voice-over narrative due to his brother's sickness. The killing of the water buffalo attracted obvious animal protection laws, and the ending was re-written countless times as Coppola had to make a film out of 2300 hours of recorded footage. Of course for obvious reasons, Francis Ford Coppola threatened suicide countless times. That's just a handful of problems and stuff that happened, if you're interested in learning more, I extremely recommend watching Eleanor Coppola's documentary ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"" (1991). <br/><br/>Based on the 1899 classic novel ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad. The story revolves around ivory trading, colonialism, cruelty, humanity and obsession. All this seems more than fitting to be adapted into a War tale. Finally beginning the movie, helicopters fly across a burning jungle all while ""The End"" by The Doors plays in the background. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is drunk, drugged out and wasting away in a room in Saigon (Anyone anxious to know this was shot on Martin's 36th Birthday, who actually WAS drunk and drugged out when he told Copolla to film what was happening and leave him to it. What happens as you see on screen he actually broke the mirror, bled out then reportedly attacked Francis. The crew were so frightened they wanted to stop yet, he ordered Coppola to continue filming). Being called upon by Generals (Most notably a cameo by Harrison Ford, under the name ""Lucas""), he is ordered to exterminate ""with extreme prejudice"" General Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando), A Green Beret who has gone AWOL.<br/><br/>What follows is Willard's mission up the Vietnamese river, on the boat he narrates his views on the War and Kurtz in the dossier given to him, questioning his respect for Kurtz as well as his mission. With his crew (Amongst them is Laurence Fishburne in his first role), all of them witness the horrors of the War and the one vital lesson: ""Never get off the boat"". On their journey they encounter a kind, yet insane Seargent Kilgore (A manic performance by Robert Duvall, who utters my favourite movie quote ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning""). They also have to contend with fellow soldiers, animals and even Playboy Bunnies (Including real-life playmate of the year Cynthia Wood).<br/><br/>Throughout the picture Kurtz is seen as a some what God-like figure to those around him, especially by an all too literal American photographer (An expertly casted Dennis Hopper). Seeing Kurtz for the first time is probably one of the most chilling, tense and surreal moments in motion picture history, and by the end of the movie Willard's goals and possibly your original thoughts are left so askew everything comes to close and certain fates are left unknown. Was the mission a success or what is the unexpected fallout after such events? Will Willard be destined to follow in Kurtz's footsteps?<br/><br/>In terms of negativity, I would like to throw in Stanley Kubrick's Interview with Michèle Halberstadt, October 1987. Kubrick: ""I think that Coppola was stuck by the fact that he didn't have anything that resembled a story. So he had to make each scene more spectacular than the one before, to the point of absurdity. ""The ending is so unreal, and purely spectacular, that it's like a version, much improved, of King Kong (laughs). And Brando is supposed to give an intellectual weight to the whole thing ""I think it just didn't work. But it's terrifically done. And there are some very strong scenes.""<br/><br/>Final Verdict: On the plus side it should be noted that many people who have seen it have declared it accurate to how it was like experiencing Vietnam. On the negative I would also say the films structure is so out of the directors hand given the events that happened behind the camera. What I can declare definitively is that Francis Ford Coppola manage to build something unforgettable with what should have been an absolute disaster. How he did it I don't know, and therefore I would say thank you sir for what was such an astonishing success and failure. 10/10. I guarantee there's never going to be anything like it again."
"tomsview","6","1","2","10 January 2013"," When redux turns to reflux
","When Francis Ford Coppola returned to ""Apocalypse Now"" in 2001, he produced more than just a director's cut – it was a veritable reworking of the original material.<br/><br/>Up until ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" the movie was generally considered to be a masterpiece – flawed – but in a category all it's own. Now, with the extra footage, it is even more flawed, and maybe not so deserving of its status as a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Burnt-out army officer Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, is ordered to find a renegade Special Forces officer, Colonel Kurtz played by Marlin Brando. Kurtz has been operating outside the scope of his orders and is believed to have gone insane.<br/><br/>Willard's journey upriver, where he is subjected to the same forces that eventually pushed Kurtz over the edge, gave this movie its resonance. The scenes added to ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" prolong the journey but diffuse the meaning in a way that surprises.<br/><br/>The greatest damage is done to Kurtz's character. That enigmatic presence has now been brought out into the light. The insights about the Vietnam War that were contained in the memorable monologue – ""the diamond bullet of clarity"" – are now referred to in a number of scenes and reiterated by Kurtz in a heavy-handed reading from Time magazine. Whatever the accusations about Brando's rambling style on the release of the movie in 1979, his performance was controversial and mysterious – you just couldn't be sure if you were witnessing genius. Now we have the answer, we probably weren't. ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" gives us too much information.<br/><br/>In an epilogue to the Kilgore sequence, Willard steals his surfboard. It makes Kilgore's character more human but also diminishes him. In the original version, Kilgore's last appearance is when he makes the ""napalm in the morning' speech. The effect at the time – Vietnam was still a comparatively recent experience – was to say that no matter how tough the Viet Cong, no matter how fanatical the enemy, our side has men who are tougher, scarier and more fanatical.<br/><br/>If the extended playboy bunny sequence was originally edited out because the filmmakers thought it slowed the movie down – they were right.<br/><br/>The French plantation sequence doesn't really seem to fit either. Coppola wisely cut the whole thing out the first time around. Although the river journey is meant to be allegorical, it is as though the boat has sailed into the ""Twilight Zone"". The sequence is also used to extrapolate political views about the Vietnam War – the original version made its point very nicely without having to deliver a sermon.<br/><br/>Coppola's method of working is to shoot lots of stuff, and then put it all together like a jigsaw puzzle. He enjoyed putting ""Apocalypse Now"" together so much that he decided to put it together again. However by adding more, Coppola has managed to do what two decades of critics were unable to do, and that is to cut his great movie down to size."
"jose-cruz53","10","1","2","15 October 2012"," Indeed a work of art
","Apocalypse Now is Coppola's most artistic work. A film fundamentally about one thing: War is Hell. To send this message this film fully utilizes all the possibilities of cinema: fully exploiting images and sounds in their capacity for generating brain stimuli. This is Coppola's most ""artistic"" film and it is a very, very different film from the Godfathers, which are much more traditional drama films. This is not a drama, nor action, nor thriller, nor any genre, though one could call it a War Epic, it is more of an art-house film made with a blockbuster budget, like the German classic, Aguirre, made with a budget 40 times larger.<br/><br/>I would place this film as the second greatest war film ever made (after the Japanese masterpiece, Grave of the Fireflies). Though these two are very different films (the second, however, generated a greater emotional response from me, that's why I put it first)"
"grantphil50","8","1","2","14 August 2012"," could keep watching this
","In making this movie, Coppola must have seen this thing that is not always visible. And if he did not see it in its entirety then in what must surely be a cliché by now, he saw enough of it to allow the heart of its darkness to pulse throughout this film.<br/><br/>And just as Coppola was changed by his experience in the jungle, so too his most mysterious character. Something happened to Colonel Kurtz. Something he saw fractured his mind, the diamond bullet shattering his perceptions into a single struggle that he himself, deep within his heart, knew he was unable to comes to terms with. And this is the crux of this movie, that this journey into darkness can promise a truth so clear that it blinds you, a truth so powerful that is keeps a hold of you and does not let you go and traps you into staying exactly, exactly where you are."

"gigan-92","10","1","2","23 January 2012"," ""Horror and moral terror are your﻿ friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies.""
","A+ <br/><br/>The 1979 Francis Ford Coppola legend, it's definitely a must see. There has been many a film to depict the nightmare that was Vietnam, among the most popular being ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987) and ""Platoon"" (1986). They're all incredible films, my personal favorite being ""Platoon"" (William Dafoe just won my heart), but when it comes to striking visuals this one takes the lead. The film is saturated with low-key lighting throughout, quite literally giving the movie the feeling of a horror story. The screenplay is greatly inspired by Joseph Conrad's novella ""Heart of Darkness""; hence the majority of the movie takes place on a fictional river. <br/><br/>While certainly a historical piece, the focal point to me would be the inner true savage nature of man which is brought out to the full by the war's onslaught. The notion it seeks to point out is that man has tried to 'domesticate' war, and to an extent their drive to kill. That is what Marlon Brando's character so vividly mocks; the top brass' attempt to make warfare humane. Though some consider his character to truly be insane, I believe he's simply ""a puppet who can see the strings"".<br/><br/>The cast is pretty exceptional, with Martin Sheen, Laurence Fishburne, Robert Duvall as the odd Kilgore, and Dennis Hopper in similar role to the one he had in ""Easy Riders"" (1969). And who could forget Sam Bottoms as the acid-tripping soldier who by the end of the movie had not much of a mind left. Adding to this is the psychedelic score by Carmine Coppola, which fits the time yet hasn't aged in the least. In fact, it adds dread to the atmosphere, a dread I honestly haven't seen in a war film since. But above all, I can say the film probably has the most epically shot battle scene of all time when it comes to war movies. Everyone knows it; in fact there was a nice little homage in Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" (2009). The timeless Wagner piece 'Ride of the Valkyries' plays as long shots show the extensive damage and mayhem. The music, the quick-cutting and the cinematography come together to make a perfect scene.<br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" is a Coppola spectacle."
"PapaRock145","10","1","2","23 October 2011"," An exciting war/thriller film
","I had heard lots about Apocalypse Now before I saw it. Mostly about how it was one of the best war movies ever made. After viewing it, I agree with that statement but I feel like it is much more. Besides just presenting the facts, Apocalypse Now takes a more artistic approach. The story is less realistic than other war movies (an American soldier gone crazy, forms his own army deep into Viet Nam.) Thats why I feel like even though it has a lot to offer about Viet Nam, it focuses less about the facts of the war and it's more about the story of Capt. Willard hunting down Kurtz. Great performances by Sheen, Brando, Hopper, and Duvall (who I only wish was in it more) Overall great movie and a great story. You shouldn't be disappointed!"
"atk92","9","1","2","23 September 2011"," The true war is within a man's soul.
","Apocalypse Now is a movie of complexity that is rarely seen in modern cinema. What I like about this movie is that it is not a Saving Private Ryan sort of war movie. This movie is narrative driven, not action driven. While SPR was a good movie in it's own right, there are no forty-five minute fight scenes to overshadow the fact that there is little to no character development in this movie. This movie examines the effects of war on man, which in the most extreme case (Kurtz) leads to the darkest depths of a man's soul. Captain Willard (Sheen) must also examine his own beliefs and inner being as he ventures further from all that keeps civilization is check and closer to true insanity in his pursuit of Kurtz. This is NOT a movie that is made to entertain, so if you want something like that, watch We Were Soldiers. This movie makes you think, and wants you to take something away from it."
"jzappa","10","1","2","7 September 2011"," All the Children Are Insane
","The most startling thing about Apocalypse Now Redux may not be the reinstated footage, but the new Technicolor dye-transfer prints. Rather than chemical color development, dyes are transferred to the film directly, bringing about the genuinely astonishing '40s, '50s Technicolor look: Sumptuous, striking, razor-sharp, glowing, with deep, authentic blacks. The consequently voluptuous and wringing wet material look of a film like this is what's threatened by digital projection. Coppola also thrusts the blanket off with the re-mastered soundtrack, which envelops us. To return home from the hell-on-earth production situation on the Philippines with a film of such specialized mastery is mind-blowing. It discredits modern apprehension. To watch it is to be elevated to the pinnacle where movies truly can actually take you, but just so seldom do. The film is a timeless cathedral hall echoing with the genuine reverberations of the war in Vietnam, in all their convolution and grief.<br/><br/>The story involves a voyage upriver by Capt. Willard, who orders a patrol boat to infiltrate enemy lines and determine the mysterious fortification of the virtually legendary Col. Kurtz, one of the Army's most decorated combatants, now commanding his own group of tribesmen. When you unearth who Kurtz has become and what he is thinking, you can see how the war took such a large role in malforming the elemental American idealism. The movie is a succession of set pieces. The most famed is the attack on a village, announcing itself with the helicopter loudspeakers blaring Wagner at the petrified students and teachers, enduring with Lt. Kilgore, hard-wired to disregard the value of Vietnamese life, and his blustering audacity on the beach, multiple times distracted completely from brutally killed or suffering Vietnamese villagers by the subject of surfing. Other sequences are also in the everlasting remembrance of moviegoers: The drugged tedium of the river expedition, the unexpected barrage of bullets that massacres a boat, the Playboy Playmates entertaining the much too frustratedly eager troops, the trancelike ultimate advance toward Kurtz's compound, the shadowed Kurtz and his grim maxims, the sniggering acquiescence of the stoned photographer, the Citizen to his Caesar.<br/><br/>To the magnificence of these scenes in their movement to Kurtz's famous last words, Coppola supplements 49 minutes, most of them invested in a stopover by the platoon to a French cultivated area, a colonial leftover that somehow endures. At dinner the Americans and French argue the colonial saga of Vietnam, and Willard's eyes encounter those of a widow who'll finish the night in his embrace. Other restored footage comprises dialogue and exploits on the boat, later comic relief with the Playmates, and added Kurtz interchange. Most importantly, this Redux is not merely a Lucas- or Spielberg-style ""special edition,"" a slight variation on the same song, but an original version of the movie, from scratch. Coppola and his longtime editor Walter Murch, one of the very best at his trade, re-edited the film from the initial uncut raw footage, and so probably even some of the shots that seem the same to us are different takes than those we experienced before.<br/><br/>The 1979 version frightened Coppola, he says, feeling it was too long, too bizarre and didn't answer itself in a sort of typical climactic battle. Confronting financial ruin, he fashioned it for the conventional audience of its era, and 20 years later, seeing it again, he found it comparatively meek. To deem this ordeal middle-of-the-road or tame in either form is a peculiar ruling for Coppola to decide on his film, but then he has a record of being rash and perplexing. My own sentiment is that the 1979 version was neither conventional nor tame, but grand, ambitious filmmaking on a magnitude within the spread of but a handful of directors, Tarkovsky, Lean, Eisenstein, Kurosawa. Right down to expressive decapitated heads and the shadow of arrows accosting a boat populated by lost, disoriented men, Apocalypse Now is the modern Aguirre in cinema terms, as well as modern Conrad in literary ones. The Redux consequently prompted my doubts. I was ecstatic to see the supplementary footage. But did the movie require it? No.<br/><br/>Regardless, some of the newly seen footage seamlessly crosses the work's threshold and evaporates, deepening it. That would take account of the river footage and some instants with Hopper's photographer. The new Brando footage, including some more barbed examination of the war, is an important adjunct. What gives me the most discomfort is the French plantation sequence. It's protracted enough that it sidetracks from the movie's complete sweep. The river passage sets the film's pulse, and too much time on the banks arrests it. But the sequence is cogent and even abrasive, despite the glaringly cringe-worthy music during the love scene. Carmine's inexplicable use of educational video-level synthesizer music, which is inspired when it's low-key, but is otherwise unforgivable and agonizing. Again, Coppola being completely baffling.<br/><br/>Longer or shorter, redux or not, and whether or not one morally agrees with using the actual ritualistic slaughtering of an actual animal as a dramatic tool in a fictitious story, and whatever other issue one may have with a unique cinematic affair of such runaway, limitless passion to an almost transgressive degree, Coppola's overpowering head trip is, regardless, one of the crucial dealings of a film-goer's life, a threshold test, a virtual reality even. To have it in this stunning print is a treat, your eyes and ears awash with its lingering vision and the reverberation from the continuous rotor blades of helicopters and from distant blasts."

","Francis Ford Coppola's controversial take on the Vietnam war still stands strong today as one of the best war movies ever made. It is a timeless classic, as well as a perfect example of the modern day epic. It's the story of Captain Benjamin Willard, played by Martin Sheen, who travels to Cambodia for an extremely confidential mission. That mission is to kill a renegade Colonel Kurtz, played by legendary Marlon Brando. It might seem like a simple synopsis, but as the film progresses it twists into a complex psychological journey, focusing on the absurdity and horror of war. The whole film encompasses a raw and visceral intensity that is beautifully constructed and perfectly paced. Its a fantastic focus on the disastrous effects of war on the human mind and it beautifully illustrates this throughout the films stunning visuals. Apocalypse Now is an incredible experience that is not for the weak of heart.<br/><br/>One of the greatest aspects of this film is definitely its visuals. They are beautifully, as well as very emotionally stirring in the context of the films events and subject matter. Coppola brilliantly utilizes light and smoke to create numerous dark and riveting effects in the film. Every moment is so carefully put together. Nothing about this film feels rushed or poorly paced in any way. And it shouldn't considering filming alone took 16 months, and the movie took three years to finally complete. Apocalypse Now is certainly extravagant, but not overdone. It never goes over the top and never feels flashy or boastful. The harrowing beauty comes in just the right amounts. It's not too much, and it's not too little. It will leave you with disturbing and also breathtaking images that are hard to forget. The film possesses the kind of indescribable passion and fervor behind its visuals that has such an intense effect on your mind when you lose yourself in this incredible experience.<br/><br/>Some of the best films ever made are war movies because of the deep and controversial subject matter they deal with. Yet with Apocalypse Now we experience something much deeper. War is but a backdrop for this film that is mostly a psychological thriller. War plays the role of ""the horror"" and its effects on the human psyche. The story and subtext of Apocalypse Now give it the dark and visceral edge that is exemplified by its visuals. The story has its strong points that drive home the purpose of this film but the characters are what fuel the psychological study of the film. Each character represents some branch of the effects of war. Martin Sheen's character the one who moves past it all and can most successfully wear a facade that suggests he can cope with the horrors he experiences. Colonel Kurtz, Brando's character, is the account of the man who has fallen off the deep end and into pure insanity. But he deals with his own insanity in his own highly unconventional way. Then of course there is Lieutenant Colonol Kilgore, played by Robert Duvall, who is the personification of the absurdity of war. He's the man who, in spite of the horrific and traumatizing events happening around him, figures it will be a good idea to surf on the beaches of your newly won encampment. He's also the speaker of the infamous line, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning."" This just about sums up what he's all about, and what he represents to the human psyche and its response to horrific events such as these.<br/><br/>I usually try not to base my opinion of a movie around what happens behind the scenes, and really try to focus on what the final product encompasses, but the cursed and horribly laborious work this film took to finish is not something that can go unmentioned. Francis Ford Coppola and his film crew flew out to the Phillipines for a scheduled six week shoot. But due to casting issues, money issues, and a typhoon that destroyed the set, those six weeks turned into sixteen months. It was one of the most stressful and exhausting shoots ever, and Coppola reportedly threatened suicide multiple times while filming. Just reading the trivia section on the movies IMDb page makes it apparent that this is the film that should have never been made. With all the unforeseen issues, it is absolutely incredible that the film was ever finished. But through Coppola's perseverance he was able to finish shooting with over 200 hours of footage, and then spend another difficult couple of years editing the film together for not just a great film, but a groundbreaking and absolutely revolutionary film experience. I can't say that there are many directors today who would stick a production like this out till the very end, and even if they did I don't know how they could manage to construct something half as good as Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>This film is a perfect look into the psychology of war, and it covers so much existential ground. It is one of the most intense and stunning cinematic experiences ever, without a single imperfection to legitimately criticize it on. It elicits emotions that are hardly describable with words, and it is something you have to experience for yourself. Apocalypse Now is one of the few films that I believe every person must see before they die. It's a massive scale epic that will withstand time, and never lose its relevance, as long as horror still exists in this world."
"mjneu59","10","1","2","3 November 2010"," Coppola's zenith
","The granddaddy of all Vietnam War films only improves with each successive viewing; in years to come, long after the others have been all but forgotten, this will be the one still being watched and talked about. Worthless as history (and never intended as such) it nevertheless is a triumph of filmmaking, showing astonishing craftsmanship in every moment of soldier/assassin Martin Sheen's obsessive search for renegade Special Forces Colonel Martin Brando. The plot is episodic (even rambling) as it follows a narrowing river deep into Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but unlike later, more popular treatments of the war it never pauses to stroke the viewer's guilt or wrap the conflict up in any sort of tidy resolution. Despite the obvious care lavished on every frame, the narrative remains even more messy and incoherent than the war itself, with each new sequence becoming more surreal and disturbing until the final, hypnotic confrontation with Brando and his native army in the pit of his own private jungle hell. Audiences continue to respond more to the helicopter attack on the Vietcong village, ironically the only conventional, 'old-fashioned' war movie scene in the entire film (a point driven home by the heroic Wagner fanfare). The last act, by contrast, is usually dismissed as too murky and cerebral, perhaps because it shows all too clearly how the human conscience becomes an irrelevant luxury when faced with the moral depravity needed to effectively exterminate an enemy. That's not exactly a message anyone wants to hear; witness the patriotic justifications for Operations Desert Storm and Just Cause, and the invasions of Panama and Granada, to name but a few of our post-Vietnam overseas adventures. The end result is a climate of horror few other war films have managed to capture."

","If you are looking for a film with a huge, muscular topless guy with a chain gun mowing down hundreds of men, then this movie is not for you, I would recommend that you watch Rambo instead.<br/><br/>Anyway, the only other war films that I have seen that I would believe relate to 'Apocalypse Now' would be 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987) and 'Platoon' (1986).<br/><br/>Firstly, what struck me about this film is the lack of the typical exaggerated, ultra-violent battle scenes which have become the norm for many war films. Instead, to capture the viewer, the mental effects of the war are highlighted by showing how the war in Vietnam has mentally broken and damaged the soldiers, and we can see how they almost deteriorate during the progression of the film, the two scenes that especially capture that are the first five or ten minutes were we can see Martin Sheen, pacing around his room in Saigon, and the scene where Colonel Kurtz speaks of the mutilation of Vietnamese children. This film is truly chilling and allows you to see the Vietnam War from a more realistic, dark perspective. This film is certainly worth a watch, but if your idea of a war film is two hours of violence, you may not appreciate 'Apocalypse Now'and what it aims to get across to you, the viewer."

","I watched this film for the first time with some friends round about the time it came out on video. I did not like it that much and decided it was just bad. Years later I watched this again on my own and unexpectedly tuned in to the themes which in my opinion is about madness and hope. In my opinion if you watch this film and see everybody as either being crazy or at the very least on the slippery slope to being crazy and in some cases knowing it then I think you will understand what this film is all about. Some of the characters at times act as if there is element of normality in what they do but it doesn't last as the world where this film is set comes crashing in to destroy any hope they may have. The destruction comes in various forms but the end result is always the same. This film is not a feel good film but it is wonderfully well made and everybody who were involved made a contribution and when it finished I said to myself but for the grace of my god I might have been there. I tried to put myself in that jungle on my own and ill equipped mentally or physically and I would have either died quickly or gone mad even quicker. It is a disturbing study of numerous people trying to survive under extreme circumstances and not succeeding. Where there is no sense there is no feeling and to me that is madness and is a horrible cushioning from reality. I would suggest anyone watch this film but please pay attention unlike me when I first watched it."

","When Francis Ford Coppola said 'Apocalypse Now isn't about Vietnam, it IS Vietnam' little did many realize how right he was. This isn't a war movie, it's a movie about madness, about insanity. The insanity of Col. Kurtz, the insanity of the war itself, and finally, and most revealing, is the real life insanity this movie caused the filmmakers and several of the actors in it. Beset by disasters, natural and otherwise, the production was over stretched, and way over budget, nearly killing it's leading man, and sending it's director to the poor house. <br/><br/>What remains is one of my favorite movies of all time. Sent on a secret mission to locate and terminate a rogue army officer, Capt. Ben Willard is astonished by what he reads in Colonel Walter Kurtz's dossier.

Based on Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness', we see Willard go deep into his own dark heart, as he ascends up the river to the final showdown with Kurtz. A confrontation that is memorable to say the least. Morality, philosophy, terror, and madness are all at the heart of Apocalypse Now..."

In a way, this is a reinvented and rethought version of Conrad's book. Coppola is subtle with his particular references to the book.<br/><br/>Coppola's daring direction and chilling music makes this film an experience to say the least. You experience the horrors of the Vietnam War as the alpha-male group of soldiers trudge up this river famously described as a snake uncoiled in Conrad's novella. Apocalpse Now is also one of my favourite beginnings of a film. The chilling blend of REM and the jungle's exploding in flames was the best possible way to open the film.<br/><br/>I would love to say what exactly this film is about in a deeper manner but its just too difficult. It raises issues about the morals of the war, the treatment of soldiers and the government's view of the soldiers.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is an astonishing war film.

"HalGuentert","10","1","2","3 November 2008"," The Movie Grows on You.
","""Apocalypse Now"" is a movie that is both disturbing and entertaining. It is also a movie that is complex enough to grow on you over time. Maybe as you learn more about the history of Vietnam and the corrupt US politics that got us there, and kept us bogged down in what seemed to be the last place on earth we needed to be fighting, the insanity makes more sense.<br/><br/>It first seemed to me like instead of a red or blue pill, everyone in the movie was on a different pill; but they were all on something to cope with their frustrating situations. Even the tiger had an abnormal attitude. No one seemed to take the war seriously except the most insane characters, and they were now being eliminated for going rogue.<br/><br/>I didn't really like the movie at first, but I had a friend who seemed to have an obsession with this movie that I couldn't understand at the time.<br/><br/>Now I see it as a brilliant trip further and further down the river toward the insanity of corrupting absolute power, losing the boundaries set by civilization & the military code of conduct, and becoming an uncontrollable, political liability.<br/><br/>At the beginning, the rogue Colonel looks heroic on paper and possibly salvageable if he will just communicate and start cooperating with his commanders. Along the way you meet people who need reality checks, but still operate within acceptable boundaries based on their stressful conditions. By the end of the eventful trip down the river, everyone knows that the Colonel has become intoxicated by his isolated & admiring tribe of soldiers and natives, and has tried to play god for too long. He has become more a native tribal leader with no respect for life outside his tribe, than an Army Colonel.<br/><br/>He is a rogue operator who gets results, an efficient killer of the enemy; but he has gradually broken away from the chain of command. In a politically motivated military, when winning is not the goal, this is the ultimate crime - sustained independent action.<br/><br/>It makes you wonder how different is Colonel Kurtz from MacArthur or Patton if they were faced with the same enemies?"
"ackstasis","10","1","2","14 October 2008"," ""Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror""
","Unlike the bulk of war films, 'Apocalypse Now (1979)' is not really about war, or, at least, it is only superficially so. The more significant conclusion to be drawn from Francis Ford Coppola's ambitious masterpiece is how the horror of war reveals the ultimate truths of our existence; how it exposes and illuminates the darkened shadows of the human psyche. The screenplay was adapted, very loosely, from Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness (1899)""  a novel not without its interest, but one that I found rather tiresome reading. Coppola transplants the story from the Congo jungle to the murky depths of the Vietnam War, which in 1979 still left a bitter taste in the mouths of American audiences. The allegory of a man, on the brink of madness, choosing again and again to pursue his own evil upriver is equally relevant in any setting  Nicholas Roeg's 'Heart of Darkness (1994)' was, from what I gather, a more traditional retelling of Conrad's tale, while Werner Herzog's 'Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972)' uncovered the darker side of Man in the desolate heart of 16th century Peru.<br/><br/>""We had access to too much money too much equipment. And, little by little, we went insane."" Fresh from the phenomenal success of 'The Godfather (1972),' its sequel and 'The Conversation (1974),' Francis Ford Coppola was among the most respected filmmakers of his era. For his long-awaited next project, he decided upon 'Apocalypse Now,' then oblivious to the extent to which the film would crush his spirit. As grippingly documented in the unmissable making-of documentary 'Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1991),' the film's production parallels that of the story it depicts  an intrepid director embarks on an impossible mission, its conclusion unknown, choosing against his better judgement to continue filming at any cost, risking insanity and financial ruin. A modest on-location shooting period soon ballooned into nearly 16 months; typhoons destroyed expensive sets; leading man Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack and battled alcoholism; the Philippine military frequently whisked away their helicopters to be used in active combat against rebel insurgents. It was Hell broken loose  for Coppola, the apocalypse had arrived.<br/><br/>The film's screenplay, by Coppola and John Milius (with Willard's memorable voice-over penned by Michael Herr), still retains many of the themes of Conrad's original novella, with Kurtz's distaste for British Colonialism replaced with his disgust at the needless hypocrisy of the United States' interventionism. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) certainly isn't a typical war hero: even at the film's beginning, he sits at the verge of breakdown. As he lounges in a sweaty Saigon motel room, Willard contemplates the seductive stench of a napalm strike, equates the beating of the ceiling fan with the muffled whirr of a military chopper; he craves the horrors of the jungle combat, and he's not alone. Many lesser war films are content to settle on the age-old cliché that ""war is hell,"" before hypocritically celebrating the overblown heroism of its brave soldiers. Coppola here does no such thing. In Vietnam, soldiers are mere pawns in this absurd, sadistic mockery of life and common sense; and war creates no heroes, but turns us all into monsters.<br/><br/>Note the progressive dwindling of humanity as Willard works his way upriver. At the river's mouth, the laid-back Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) casually goes about his duties, launching an explosive aerial assault on a Vietnamese village (to the bombastic notes of Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"") purely because of the beach's ideal surfing conditions. This nonchalant fool retains enough compassion to bring water to a dying enemy soldier, but discards the canteen as soon as he notices the arrival of a famous American surfer. We progress upstream: a love-sick mob of recruits overrun a USO show, a boatload of Vietnamese civilians are gunned down in a moment of panic, a final American outpost operates frantically without any form of command. By the time they reach Colonel Kurtz's (Marlon Brando) outpost in Cambodia, where natives have idolised him as a demi-god, Captain Willard and his remaining crew have shed every last sliver of humour, purpose and humanity. They progress, as in a drug-induced haze, towards the now-inescapable mouth of madness.<br/><br/>Watching 'Apocalypse Now'  particularly in the cinema, as I recently did  was an extraordinarily invigorating experience, and I left the theatre with a cold chill down my spine. As a work of film-making, it is, to quote Colonel Kurtz, ""perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure."" Vittorio Storaro's on-location cinematography is completely breathtaking in its scope and immediacy, shifting gradually from the open-air theatrics of Kilgore's morning aerial assault to the closed, claustrophobic shadows of Kurtz's compound. At the long-awaited premiere, Coppola described his film, perhaps a tad pretentiously, as ""not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam; it's what it was really like."" I'm inclined to agree. With respect to Steven Spielberg's accomplishments in 'Saving Private Ryan (1998),' I'd imagine that the human experience of war is not one of terrifying realism and clarity, but of a dream, the sensation of stumbling through a surreal carnival house of horrors. In the film's final moments, as that shadow of a helicopter flitters across the screen, we know that, wherever he goes from here, Willard will never truly leave the jungle."
"shortyrags","10","1","2","21 July 2008"," A Film that Transcends Its Genre!
","Let me be frank when I say this: Apocalypse Now is not a war movie. There aren't long, drawn-out gun fight sequences and there isn't a lot of confrontation. However, this film is so much more satisfying for what it truly is. Apocalypse Now is actually a modern retelling of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now reintroduces and builds upon the themes presented in Conrad's masterpiece. For anyone who hasn't read Heart of Darkness, I suggest it. This film separates itself from the rest of the similar Vietnam period films made when it comes to its core concept: its plot.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now tells the story of a young soldier, Benjamin Willard, played by Martin Sheen, who is sent on a mission to find and ""relieve"" the renegade Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando, of his duties. Willard is unsure of what he will find as he makes his way down the river toward the location of Kurtz, and as he travels deeper down the river, he descends into the darkness. I never want to spoil anything so I'll leave the plot at that, but let's just say that there are a fair share of disturbing and memorable scenes.<br/><br/>Of course, the characters are what really bring this whole story to life. Martin Sheen does a great job, portraying the gradual realizations of Willard, and his constant confusion in the midst of two powerful forces. Marlon Brando brings the character of Kurtz to life and accurately portrays him just as I always envisioned him in Heart of Darkness. I don't really want to tell you much about the character though. It's best that like Willard, slowly flowing down the river, you learn more and more as you watch the film. There are some great supporting performances too like Robert Duvall's performance as Colonel Kilgore, a cunning yet maniacal officer, who is best remembered for his trademark line, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning."" These performances really add so much more depth to this already powerful and pervasive film.<br/><br/>The camera work is great here and what else would you expect from Coppola. Coupled with large rounds of intense music and more subtle touches, Coppola's cinematography really brings the setting of Vietnam to life. The atmosphere is haunting at times yet enchanting at others. It truly feels like we are watching the events unfold from Willard's perspective.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, I was left satisfied and slightly perturbed, much like how I felt after reading Heart of Darkness. The film truly brings another dimension of Vietnam to the table, with classic themes told through the medium of war. Ultimately, this is not a war movie. This is a movie about a man's journey into the heart of darkness and what he finds there. It has its share of sequences with bullets being exchanged, but make no mistake; this film transcends the war genre and adds a novel magnitude to the film culture of Vietnam."
"padraigdeignan","10","1","2","25 June 2008"," A physiological journey through war
","Apocalypse Now is one of my favourite films and a great adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness to the Vietnam War by Coppola and Milius and under difficult circumstances and conditions there were exceptional performances by all the actors concerned. Coppola did a fantastic job capturing the whole physiological dimension of the Vietnam War, in particular, and all wars in general. The psychological and physical journey down the river, highlighting many of the aspects of the Vietnam War, including the distance of the generals from the war, commanders like Kilgore who enjoyed the war, the eccentricities and very different personalities of those involved, young inexperienced and confused soldiers, drugs, technology, the air war, the pointlessness defending of strategically unimportant places, the idea of no front lines, primitive and modern ways of fighting a war, the indigenous people of Vietnam, the politics of the war and arguments over how the war should be best fought, the conflict of ethics and civilisation, the humanitarian aspects of the war and the brutal measures adopted by both sides and a philosophical understanding of what possessed those to do what they did. The film also covers atrocities carried out by both sides, suffering of the civilians caught up in the middle of it all, and how powerless they were to avoid an acute involvement in the war. The movie also explores the idea of conditioning a soldier to go out and win battles but the difficulty of then asking him to only fight the war in a particular manner. The concept of the problem the army had with Green Berets, independent, intelligent and educated soldiers, allowed to operate on their own is also assessed. There is some disjoint in the Redux scenes, especially regarding the extra scenes involving the playboy bunnies as pointed out by some other submitters to this website. However, the French plantation scene provides a deeper insight into the war, comparing U.S. involvement with the French colonial war 1945-54, and showing the ghost like world in which the French settlers now live, neither belonging to France or Vietnam and is interesting from a post-colonial perspective. The French plantation scene also provides some continuity in the journey up the river and back in time, as Coppola wanted. There were also a couple of scenes from the 'Apocalypse Now  The Complete Dossier' which could have been including and may have cast more light on the characters in the film  'the tiger cages' scene with Kurtz and Willard and the 'Special forces knife' scene with Colby and Willard. The scene with Willard in the tiger cage while Kurtz discusses how he is prosecuting the war in a much more primitive and brutal manner in order to win at practically any cost, and Willard disagreeing gives a more in-depth insight into Kurtz and shows that Willard is not going to take the same path as Colby and join Kurtz. The scene with Colby and Willard gives a greater understanding of Colby's state of mind after he had refused to carry out his original mission and had joined Kurtz. However, he has not been completely taken over by the darker nature, and detached himself from his emotions, and he urges Willard to kill Kurtz and explain things to his wife and kids but unlike Kurtz's later request to Willard regarding his son, Colby asks Willard not to tell them everything. Although Milius sought a different ending, the ending Coppola decided on, the idea of the primal myth of death and rebirth, suggested by Denis Jakob, a friend of Coppola's was probably far more suited to the atmosphere and mood of the film."
"benjamin_lappin","10","1","2","19 June 2008"," The War That Led To Insanity And Beyond
","Attempting to stay clear of, by running parallel to, the clichéd ""what is the point of war"" motif, Francis Ford Coppola directs a stunning portrayal of loyalty, service and madness during the Vietnam war, perhaps the most surreal and nonsensical of all wars, through his most surreal and the most hard hitting about the condition of men in war, Apocalypse Now. Coppola never glamorises the war, he never shies away from showing the brutal nature of the war, capturing scenes of brutal savagery, the irony of which being that these acts of barbarism were not committed by the Vietnamese that were viewed as savages, but the Americans that came to liberate them. <br/><br/>Through the performances of his three leading men Coppola continually pounds in to the viewer the sheer insanity of the Vietnam war, that these were soldiers sent out to ostensibly protect the South Vietnamese (as well purge the ever spreading threat of communism) but ended up killing them as much as the Vietcong. That these men are trained to be killing machines and are then somehow expected to maintain morality. The jungles provide a wonderful backdrop to the film as they themselves become part of a transcendent blur, where these lines of consciousness and insanity meet, creating the feel of something out of a nightmare, when for many it was real life.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen as Captain Willard gives a memorable performance for as he progresses up the ever narrowing, ever encapsulating ever confining river the degrees of insanity he encounters increases, as does the ever increasing doubt in himself. Encountering Robert Duvall as the bloodthirsty war mongering Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore whose name sums up all that need be said. An officer who enjoys killing ""Charlie"" with a well executed plan as much as going surfing on a beach still hot with activity and gets his jollies from sniffing napalm in the morning breeze. As Willard learns more about the officer he must confront at the end of the mission the more of the officer he sees in himself, as a surreally erotic U.S.O shows turn the troops into lecherous madmen and he passes encampments where the occupants are permanently verging on schizophrenic he ponders over that line that others have crossed and he feels himself slipping onto. <br/><br/>The final confrontation leaves Willard in a state of moral upheaval, he sees why the men have succumb and understands their reasonings, and he sees that same potential in himself, which makes for the epic meeting between Willard and the seemingly deranged but philosophically poetic Colonel Kurtz. Kurtz is the personification of all that is whispering to Willard from one half of his being, apotheosising the negative aspects, into the god like being he presents before the natives. Finding himself in the uncompromising position of the head to head confrontation he must ascertain whether Kurtz is truly insane or whether he is seeing the world with unclouded eyes. Coppola's adaptation is an engrossing affair shot simply, in a realistically gritty manner. Delivered is a stark and brutal account of the nonsensicalities of war, the oxymorons and dichotomies, how the soldiers are expected to kill and yet somehow remain human. His leads carry the humanist element effectively and make it a convincing and utterly stunning affair into the psyches of men who must risk their all, and often in the process risk losing themselves. This isn't a story about Vietnam, this is the story of a man in pursuit, not of a colonel, but of himself against the forces that surround him."

","Coppola couldn't leave well enough alone. Redux adds an embarrassing scene where the Suzy-Q Playboy Bunnies sell their bodies for chopper fuel. There is also a long, boring episode at a French plantation where Sheen ends up sacking a Frenchwoman with an accent so thick that nary a word from her is comprehensible. Other scenes have also been expanded, making the film as bloated as Brando. However, the spectacular imagery remains intact, along with the soundtrack of classic 1960s songs and, in that rousing attack on the village, Wagner. Rather than improving the film, this overindulgent director's cut cancels out some of the positive qualities of the 1979 version, reducing the rating from 8 to 7."

","This is a classic Viet Nam film with an excellent cast and fantastic story line. I've watched it with Viet Nam vets and not only did they like it, they could actually relate some of their experiences to it. It was one film that got my father in law to open up his own experiences as a U.S. Army chopper pilot in country during 1967-68. I joined the U.S. Navy in 1977 and served with former ""grunts"" and ""brown water"" sailors. Every one of these individuals came back to the world a little messed up. It's one of my all time favorites; right up there with ""Platoon"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""The D.I."" I've lost count of the times I've watched this film and I always seem to find something new or gain more insight into what our men and women experienced in our long and protracted conflict in Southeast Asia. I think anyone considering entering the military should see this."

","Having seen this film for the second time about two months ago, I am yet to finish wiping my brains off the walls from when my mind blew. Going into the film I was slightly sceptcial due to the disappointment of the Godfather series. I had also seen The Conversation, which was impressive, so I decided to give this one a shot. To this day it is indisputably my favourite film.<br/><br/>I had always considered Heart of Darkness to be one of the great literary texts, and its adaptation is as close to perfect as I can imagine. The genius of Coppola is in the initial idea to turn Conrad's novella into a war film set in Vietnam, allowing him some flexibility with the characters. Captain Willard, played superbly by Martin Sheen, replaces Conrad's literary character Charles Marlow, and other replacements are visible throughout the film (Dennis Hopper replacing 'the Russian' for example). Coppola, whose understanding of the text seems absolute, saw that a literal adaptation of the novella would prove to be impossible, or at least fail (as the film 'Heart of Darkness' proved), because it could not possibly preserve the philosophical intensity prevalent in Conrad's writing. The film combines a brilliant script, great performances (particularly from Sheen and Robert Duvall), and stunning visual effects to do justice to one of the great philosophical works.<br/><br/>The main themes of Heart of Darkness, namely the underlying irrationality of society and the true violent nature of humanity, are explored cleverly and comprehensively through the setting of war, one of the great showcases for these themes. The intensity of the book which is impossible to translate into film is more than made up for by the incredible special effects which will have you gasping for much of the time.<br/><br/>I agree with IMDb's top 250 in one sense; a Coppola movie should indeed be at #1, but it isn't the Godfather part II"

","Apocalyse Now has been something that a lot of movie critics have been banging on about for a while! In fact they go on about it so much that they actually end up killing some of its magic I feel. Although it should be something that should be watched by every movie lover the truth was that I was putting of watching it for quite a while. Reasons ranged from me being young and not understanding it well enough to me not really liking war movies that much. However I came across a really cheap DVD copy of it some time ago and thought might as well give it shot. One should keep in mind that this is the review of the redux movie and not the original Copella film version. What I can say is that I understand why this movie won a few awards , I mean Martin Sheen is just plain cool and it is a joy watching him undertaking this journey into madness as well as the creepy but yet enthralling philosophical Brando. The whole movie is like conducting some sort classical music - loud and flamboyant one minute then calm and serene the other ! What I also just loved about it was that the scenes matched wonderfully with the music and thusly creating some sort of magical method of drawing one into its world. The lighting, colouring actually the whole way that the movie was shot actually showed us a trip into the jaws of hell , in which one hangs on for dear sanity but feels completely disconnected from the world around him and that is what I felt that Apocalyse Now is really all about. The down side about Apocalyse Now Redux is that it is a little way too long and does require a solid frame of mind view , one just like Martin Sheen has 'want' it to enjoy it. Although the movie uses visuals and colours nicely it just sometimes drags on a little to far which might cause one to lose interest in it I mean I understand it is a build up to a big climax but it should keep you building towards that and not sway away. To conclude I am glad I finally got a chance to see Apocalyse Now , although it might not have been the original but I am glad I got to see it , because to me it was not really a movie focusing on a war but a movie focusing on the horror of war and the madness it brings with it. As a wise man said 'war is only good to those who have not tasted it', so I would say check it out and draw your own conclusion , I am glad I finally got round to it.<br/><br/>APOCALYSE NOW : REDUX - 8.3 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>The Horror...The Horror..."
"DarthVoorhees","9","1","2","21 March 2008"," Nice atmosphere but the pay off for Kurtz is kind of a let down
","Apocalypse Now is a great film, one that doesn't follow the clichés of all too many war films and turns the war into a mental struggle. Instead of being offered the same war is hell or the large scale battle scenes of other war films, Apocalypse Now chooses to tell another story. The story told here is how the inner demons of men can come out during war.<br/><br/>The Vietnam War is different in the fact that there was no true clear cut enemy. The enemy was the jungle and what could come out of it, be it a child or a woman armed with a weapon. Apocalypse Now uses this very effectively. Willard isn't sure who the enemy is anymore and he can't believe he is being sent to kill a decorated hero who on paper he respects. Kurtz is driven mad by this. He was taught to fight in a war which had honor, and this new war makes him question how war is meant to be fought.<br/><br/>Brando was easily one of the all time greats, a master of acting. Apocalypse Now's plot and mental reasoning is constructed to the point where Brando is essentially the heart and soul of the film with only fifteen or so minutes of actual screen time. Sadly Ol' Marlon's heart isn't in the right place. In Apocalypse Now I can actually see the Brando we heard about, the difficult actor who could wrap the director around his finger. Brando's performance in Apocalypse Now is the center of much debate, some find the performance masterful others laugh at it, I found myself in the middle.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen is an underrated actor, many place him to the side a lot of the times in supporting roles but he carries this picture effectively. Essentially the film isn't the Vietnam War, we don't spend a lot of screen time on the battlefield but we do get the feeling that the jungle is hell, largely thanks to Sheen. The war in Apocalypse Now is largely a mental one, and how Willard and Kurtz have dealt with their shell shock and morality due to the war. Coppola has probably created the largest scale psychological thriller of all time.<br/><br/>I loved the fact that since Coppola is adapting Heart of Darkness, the journey down the river symbolizes many different things. Not unlike the other adaptations or interpretations of the story, the journey symbolizes a descent into madness or hell if you will.<br/><br/>The war is chronicled very well, the visuals and settings are amazing. I felt that the backgrounds here capture the state of fear that these men faced. The cinematography effectively creates a larger than life setting.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola does some of his finest work here simply because the main character is good and is in a really believable struggle unlike some of the beyond belief story lines in every Coppola film after Godfather II.<br/><br/>Brando is the flaw that keeps this film from being another Coppola masterpiece. I just found that he was too over-dramatic in his readings. Coppola effectively compensates for some of this by leaving Brando in the dark and creating more mystery to him. You don't get a good look at him throughout the original cut, the only shot of Kurtz in daylight is in the Redux edition of the film."

","This movie has given me one of the greatest movie experiences in my life. That is why I don't have a choice but to give it 10/10.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie countless times (the original one), I have had Eleanor Coppola's: ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"" on VCR and seen that one more times than I can remember and I have read several reviews of the movie from Magazines etc.<br/><br/>According to the legend it is based on Joseph Conrad's ""Hearts of Darkness"" and several directors (Orson Welles for instance) have tried to put that book into a usable film-script but failed.<br/><br/>So Francis Coppola tried, and told it as a story of a Captain Willard who, during the Vietnam war, gets the assignment to go up a river (into Cambodia (""that's classified"")) to find Colonel Kurtz whose ""methods are unsound"" and to ""exterminate him with extreme prejudice"".<br/><br/>The opening scene is simply outstanding. We see Willard in a hotel room haunted by his demons, bursting into tears and smashing the mirror with his bare hands. The score is the Doors ""the End"" - a superb choice. If you see Eleanor Coppola's movie you will realize that Martin Sheen is actually on the brink of a mental breakdown and that Coppola exploits it. The crew is afraid that he will actually attack Coppola but nonetheless Coppola keeps directing him, bringing out emotions of sorrow in him. So what you see in this opening scene is not so much acting as it is a man who is actually on the verge of a mental breakdown.<br/><br/>Willard gets on a boat with a small group of soldiers and as they go up that river we slowly learn about Colonel Kurtz through the dossiers that Willard brings along as well as getting acquainted with the madness of war.<br/><br/>What we learn about Kurtz is, that he has had an outstanding military career but that at a certain point he starts to use methods that cannot be tolerated by his superiors.<br/><br/>After a long and dangerous journey we finally reach Kurtz's hide-out and are greeted by a very nervous guy (Dennis Hopper) with pseudo-philosophical thoughts and a local tribe. From him we learn the Kurtz is clear in his mind but sick in his soul and that he expects something from Willard - understanding? Later Kurtz returns and takes Willard as a prisoner and talks with him about war in some dialogs that sends shivers down your spine. Kurtz tells Willard about his war experiences and of one in particular that made him realize what it takes to win a war. What he tells is that he earlier in the Vietnam war went into a village where he together with other US soldiers inoculated the children of that village. After they leave the village they are suddenly called back and upon returning they see that the north Vietnamese have been there and hacked off every little inoculated arm. And as if ""shot by a diamond bullet in his forehead"" Kurtz realizes that an act like this is what is needed to win the war. He goes on and claims that a soldier that can do an act like this is not a monster but just has an extraordinary amount of will; the will to win the war.<br/><br/>After having this ""revelation"" colonel Kurtz applies the same sort of methods himself and although they are very effective they cannot be tolerated by his superiors and this is why Willard gets the assignment to terminate him. Kurtz's way of viewing how a war should be fought poses some very interesting questions that are difficult to answer in a simple way. As I see it Kurtz's point is, that once you have decided to go to war it really doesn't make sense not to use any method available to win it. There can only be total war if you really want to win. The act of hacking off the arms of the children has been done in the attempt to win the war and should not to be seen as an act motivated by mere hatred. If you concern yourself with the civilians and human rights then you are a nothing but a hypocrite. Kurtz then becomes a very efficient soldier but his new war-philosophy makes it impossible for him to stay ""human"" (or makes him sick in his soul as stated by Hopper).<br/><br/>It has been stated that the ending is a flop. Coppola himself struggled hard to find a suitable ending and I am not sure that he was altogether satisfied with this one. To me I always understood it this way: Kurtz wants Willard to kill him as he has probably seen and imposed horrors beyond our wildest imaginations which makes it nearly impossible for him to carry on. When he at last is brought down by Willard the only thing that comes to his mind is ""the horror, the horror"". He is truly sick in his soul.<br/><br/>I will recommend this to anyone as I think it tries to give us some account on what war can bring out in the soldiers who are sent away to fight.<br/><br/>regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist. If you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews."

","I love the original Apocalypse Now, this is the Francis Coppola movie I saw, I love the director immediately. 20 years later, the Redux of AN came out, I was delighted to see some of the extra footages in it. But I had to say, I was disappointed, the Redux brought nothing to the movie except boredom, irrationality, and extreme length. The point of AN has gone and I felt like watching a complete mess. The scene Willard and his guys trade their fuel for bunnies is so ludicrous that made me laugh so hard, I paused a minute to calm myself down. The French Plantation scene was too long to watch, even though I have a long attention span, I still couldn't watch it through. After such loooooooong time, I totally lost my interest in seeing the Redux, I turned my TV off right before they got to Col.Kurtz. Francis Coppola cut out those scenes for good reasons and now he addded them again? I have to say this is my first time I was let down by Francis Ford Coppola."
"gcd70","7","1","2","11 January 2008"," The Insanity of the Vietnam War
","Francis Ford Coppola presented the world in 1979 a war epic about the insanity of Vietnam by telling us the story of much decorated Colonel Kurtz who, having lost his mind, had taken command of a motley crew of soldiers and natives and lead them across the border into Cambodia, leaving a trail of death and destruction behind him. Lieutenant Willard is assigned the unenviable mission of sailing up river through treacherous ""Charlie"" territory in order to locate Kurtz and terminate him.<br/><br/>Willard (Martin Sheen) takes us on a powerful tour of what was a crazy war, as he comes across more and more frightening people and situations the further he journeys, until finally confronting the ultimate madman.<br/><br/>Coppola's film, the first of it's kind to deal with Vietnam, is forceful and unrelenting in the extreme, and very much not for the faint hearted. Martin Sheen gives a very strong performance as the lieutenant whose own sanity is on a knife edge and whose heart may have already turned to darkness, while Marlon Brando delivers a typically memorable turn of commendable weight as the twisted Colonel. All other support players are impressive too, with Dennis Hopper, Robert Duvall, Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall and Larry Fishburne all striking in the memory. The technical crew weren't ignored at the Oscars, with cinematography and sound taking out that year's awards, along with a best supporting actor Oscar for Duvall.<br/><br/>Certainly ""Apocalypse Now"" achieves its objective, that is to show the true heart of an insane war and to disturb its audience in the process, though it probably never went a long way toward an in-depth and understanding overview. Rest assured however that Francis Coppola will never be forgotten for what is an astounding and shocking movie. I shouldn't neglect to mention that some of the cinematography is truly awesome, and is best appreciated at the movies.<br/><br/>Sunday, July 10, 1994 - Video"
"RJBurke1942","9","1","2","6 January 2008"," As somebody said: 'We've seen the enemy, and they is us!'
","I saw AN soon after it was first released. Years later, I forget when, I saw Coppola's documentary about the making of AN. That helped to clear up, for me, some of the very odd jump shifts and cuts that were obvious in the first release of this epic story about...well, I'll get to that below.<br/><br/>First, however, I'll say a word (or few) about the original novella  Heart of Darkness - from Joseph Conrad. Written in the style of Conrad's times  a series of nested first and third person narratives - it's not mainstream for sure. In fact, most of today's reading audience would not read it, I think. Moreover, the whole narrative is a bit of a chore to follow (it's many years since I read it). Conrad, however, wasn't interested in entertaining per se; he was more interested in asking fundamental questions about the human condition and this story went to the heart of the matter: what drives people to do terrible things?<br/><br/>That, in a nutshell, is what AN is all about; and, in this film, you see many people do terrible things. The fact that Coppola dressed up Conrad's central question within a fictional episode of the Vietnam War served two purposes: it brought Conrad's thesis into the mainstream and also allowed Coppola to make his own philosophical statement about the Vietnam War. Well, by all accounts, he certainly succeeded in both objectives. The phrase 'heart of darkness' is bandied about now so often, I'm sure most would know where they first saw it; and that wouldn't have been while reading Conrad, I reckon. Moreover, in all probability, the narrative Coppola constructed around Conrad's question will stand as the definitive criticism about war in general, and the Vietnam War in particular.<br/><br/>And I say that in full recognition of the other fine directors (Milestone, Fuller, Malick, Kubrick, Eastwood etc) who have given us great war movies that also stand as classics.<br/><br/>With the possible exception of Kubrick's Dr Strangelove (1964)  that savage, comedic satire about the Cold War  AN is, I think, the very best satire about war. But, it's not a comedy, although one might be forgiven for laughing at Colonel Kilgore's (Robert Duvall) antics when attacking the Vietcong village, attempting surfboarding during battle, BBQing on the beach, or loving the smell of napalm or ""victory"", to use the Colonel's word. And not to be missed is Captain Willard's (Martin Sheen, in his best work) coming ashore to met by none other than Coppola portraying a gung-ho documentary producer/director who keeps shouting, ""Don't look at the camera, keep going, keep going, don't look at us, look like you're fighting, keep going..."" And, all the while, the mortar rounds crump in the distance, the Hueys thump-thump-thump on by, and the people screaming for help go unheard.<br/><br/>The satire continues as Capt. Willard is carried up river aboard a Navy patrol boat towards Cambodia where he must assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), the officer whose methods, according to top brass, are ""unsound""  a euphemism for 'crazy'. Along the way, the crew of the boat and Willard first encounter some jungle jollies for the grunts  a Bunny show, staged at a supply depot on the river that, of course, gets completely out of hand as sex-starved soldiers attempt to get their lusts satisfied. The mute Vietnamese people  outsiders in their own land  watch through chain-link fencing with big eyes and must wonder at the crazed antics of the Americans. Grinning ruefully and shaking his head, Willard gets the boat going again, up river...<br/><br/>Further up, they encounter an all but destroyed Medic unit, mired in mud from incessant rain, and mired in lust from incessant sex with live-in Bunnies, there as 'treatment' for broken bodies and minds. Well, thinks Willard, no doubt: what else is there to do in this crazy and God-forsaken place? Trading some fuel for sex for the crew seemed like a good idea at the time. After which they again carry on up river...<br/><br/>And are stopped by some bizarre French colonialists who are mired in past glories of French colonial conquests and defeats. In a bizarre dinner, Willard is subjected to vitriolic abuse, from some at the table, about the stupidity of the American efforts in Asia and Vietnam in particular. However: there they are  the stupid French  still arguing about the merits of Dien Bien Phu and the French defeat  or victory, depending on your point of view. And, after bedding one of the women, Roxanne (Aurore Clement), Willard continues with his quest...<br/><br/>Which, as he gets closer, he realizes is not what it seems to be. However, it is when he meets Kurtz that his odyssey ends - or so he thinks. Because along that tortuous river, Willard has explored, via voice-over narration, the tortuous machinations of the rationale for and against the bloody conflict in which he had been mired in for years and finally comes to realize that, in the final analysis, he and Kurtz are kindred spirits. Weeks before, the brass had said to Willard: ""Cut the head off the snake, and the body dies."" And so, Willard completes his mission  physically and, most importantly, symbolically as he cuts power off the radio to air strike operations, thus keeping his location hidden.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the Redux version includes footage that fleshes out the interplay between Willard and Kurtz, so that when the denouement arrives, the reasons for Willard's final decisions are completely rational within the irrational world of war.<br/><br/>For me, the ending of the cinema version never made sense, psychologically or militarily; but, that's studio bosses getting their way, I suppose. The Redux version says it all. It's long (220+ minutes), but I didn't get up even once to get a drink of water.<br/><br/>Highest recommendation for all mature adults."

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that would care to do any introspection or even learn something about humanity. Brando does a spectacular performance as Kurtz and I applaud him for his presentation of his character. Sheen does an amazing job as well with his character.

"michael_the_nermal","7","1","2","17 October 2007"," Copolla's Apocalypse
","Warning! Spoilers Ahead! This movie seems like the high-water mark for Francis Ford Copolla; nothing he has made since has been as favorably reviewed in the eyes of most critics. This is the third Copolla movie I've seen, and, while I admire Copolla's ambition, the film does not compare to his two classic Godfather movies. Simply put, the acting is not as excellent, and there are too many extraneous scenes.<br/><br/>The movie is most definitely NOT a straight Vietnam war movie, or even a straight war movie, period. There is little attempt at realism here. It is, simply, an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" set in the Vietnam War. Kurtz, as he was in the novel, is an idealistic white man who is the best of the best in his own civilization but, when exposed to the other-worldliness of a non-Western tropical society beset with colonial exploitation and the white man's savagery while trying to ""tame"" this landscape, he himself becomes the most demonic of the savages. Conrad's protagonist in the framework story, Marlowe, is reinvented as an out-of-it army officer assigned to kill the savage Kurtz. While he moves toward's Kurtz's lair in the heart of the jungle, he encounters the madness of Vietnam, including the Americans' disregard for human life, a battle without a commanding officer, and crazed GIs, bereft of the veneer of civilization, assaulting a USO show featuring Playboy bunnies. The results are ultimately uneven, and this may be due in large part to the difficulties of adapting Conrad's novel to the screen, especially when set in the context of the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>Conrad's novel was meant to highlight the horrors of white cruelty towards Africans in the Belgian Congo in their pursuit for ivory and rubber wealth. The Vietnam War is a bit more ambiguous with regards to similar colonial ambitions. Historians today still debate the reasons for the Americans entering Vietnam, but it seems a bit of a stretch to compare Vietnam with the blatant colonialism Conrad was describing. Copolla made a rather odd choice by selecting Vietnam as a proxy for the savagery of Belgian colonial rule, and this made his adaptation all the more difficult. Secondly, Copolla also had difficulty translating Conrad's symbols in a visual format. The savage whites are shown as helicopter pilots who spray bullets and fluorescent napalm on helpless victims below. It all seems like too much for the senses to take in. The massacre on the riverboat seems too quick and abrupt, and does not flow smoothly with the theme of savagery Copolla apparently had in mind.<br/><br/>Copolla, unfortunately, did not have the perfect cast of actors he had in ""The Godfather."" Martin Sheen is very good as the Marlowe character, but, as he is the ""narrator"" of the story, his participation is mostly subdued. Marlon Brando has deteriorated greatly since his role as Don Corleone. His delivery is monotone and stiff, and his acting utterly lethargic. He clearly seems to be going through the motions as the Kurtz character. The actors on Marlowe's boat do well, but do not compare to the ""Godfather"" cast.<br/><br/>In all, this was a highly ambitious and worthy film, but the difficulty of placing this vision on screen makes it flawed. The best scene is in the ""redux"" version, where Martin Sheen faces the last vestiges of desperate colonialism on a French rubber plantation. That alone is a classic movie scene, and much closer to Conrad's work than most of the film's frantic, chaotic scenes. I recommend ""Apocalypse Now,"" but do not expect a masterpiece."
"jaredmw","10","1","2","7 May 2007"," Smells Like Victory
","""Apocolypse Now"" is more of a piece of art than a movie. The cinematography, acting, directing, score and screenplay work together as a whole better than any movie has ever done. As a period piece it is widely compared to ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" as to which movie more accurately depicts the Vietnam war. I have heard by many in my family who fought in Vietnam that ""Platoon"" does better at showing the experience of everyday life in Vietnam but that ""Apocolypse Now"" hands down displays the truest feelings of despair, hopelessness and loss that took place in Vietnam. Loss as in the loss of one's self.<br/><br/>Throughout the whole movie there is a constant elusive reality that the characters in the movie loose more and more as they travel up the river. The movie is so thought provoking and psychedelic that it entrances you and begs you to watch it. And what Brando does in this film is nothing less than perfect. Marlon Brando accomplished displaying sanity within insanity and makes every viewer of movie question what truth and power really are. <br/><br/>To watch Duvall stand in the middle of a battlefield affixed in a mechanic yet vulnerable state is quite an experience to witness and probably one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Not to mention, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed for twelve strait hours. When it was all over I walked up and we didn't find a one of 'em. Not one stinking dink body. But that smell, you know that gasoline smell-the whole hill smelled like...victory."" <br/><br/>Coppola takes one scene and morphs it into the other so smoothly that when the movie ends you finally realize that it is just a movie. I have never seen a movie more impactive. It was one of the very first movies I ever watched and it set a very high standard of what I consider true movie making. A true movie experience that takes you to another world."

But Captain Willard's intentions are different from Dante's: he is to go to the bottom and kill the devil. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie can be read as a progressive's interpretation of the Vietnam war.The gratuity of American violence, the vision of war as a macabre sport(""Charlie don't surf""), the despise of anything alien to American culture (and hence, the intention of bringing the USA with you to the other side of the world). Fear of othernerness as the mechanism that makes the soldier somewhat efficient. <br/><br/>As Willard and his group advance through a bloody Disneyland, filled with corpses of Vietcong and passive Vietnamese, they arrive to the line of front: the bridge that has to be reconstructed every night only to satisfy the needs of the propaganda machine. We are now at the middle of the trip (in both senses of the word), where Zombie soldiers, mad and calm, fight against an invisible and omnipresent enemy. <br/><br/>After the bridge is crossed, the film will become symbolic, and will try to explain Vietnam in a somewhat philosophical way: the forces of the barbarian, with their prehistorical weapons, decimate the supposed rappresentatives of Civilization, and the renegade Colonel Kurtz has installed a reign of terror and atrocities. He does it against himself, only to show (and to show himself) the vacuum that exists in the depths of Western Civilization: a vacuum that can only be filled with horror. The second part of the film is not as strong, not as tight, as the first one. <br/><br/>The music deserves praise. It works not only to put you in the times, but also defines the state of mind, the feelings of the characters and the feeling of war itself. On one side, it clearly shows the social function of music, as the expression of a generation that was involved, against their will, in the most atrocious violence and -uncapable of an organized rebellion against the system- turned their parricide vocation (""Father? -Yes, son -I want to kill you"", says Jim Morrison) against other peoples and, finally, against itself."

","briefly......... i love this film. i feel that this is without a doubt the best film ever to grace cinema screens.<br/><br/>i love it for its hidden meanings and the entire way the director leaves the viewer thinking about the different themes and meanings for days afterwards. however to be truly appreciated i feel that it has to be understood fully. although the general plot is easy to follow the truly epic end in the kurtz compound deserves praise for being cleverly written for instance, kurtz being killed out of respect rather than malice by Willard. finally i like many films such as pulp fiction an goodfellas for their style and brutality. what i feel sets apocalypse now from these is that it is very well crafted and i appreciated the truly epic scenery and high budget war scenes. apocalypse now simply is not for everyone however if you can appreciate the brilliant cinematography i think you will agree it is one of the finest films in existence and in my opinion the finest."

","Contrary to Martin Zimmermann above I would actually believe the Redux version very much adds to the development of the characters and the film as such ... there are as far as I remember three scenes added to the original. The first add (the mugging of the surfboard) shows some of the characters (Lance but also Kilgore) as the kids they actually are, plus the humor adds to the shock of the upcoming disturbing scenes ... The second scene (the tête-à-tête with the bunnies/hookers) is quite surreal and reminds me a bit of ""Catch 22"" ... it also explains why Chief Phillips is so bullheaded in frisking the Sampan (release of tension) ... The third added scene (the visit of the french plantation) is somewhat more difficult ... on one hand the dialog is highly valuable (seems like nobody is willing to learn from the mistakes of others) on the other hand the plot is not very credible ... personally, I would have put the scene at the very end of the movie, where the impact would gain more gravitas: once Willard takes a shower the dirt seems to be washed away, however the stains remain though invisible ...."

","First of all, I would like to say that the Redux was very bad. The original was better and smaller in terms of time. Perhaps the movie overreacts and all the dialouges and stuff are pretty overrated but the average grunt in Vietnam experienced this. Like the main character who hated going back to the World(USA) because of all the war protesters who were cowards not to go to Vietnam. He came back to Vietnam and the first scene is awesome and the song The End by Doors is a amazing setting to all the choppers flying over the jungle and then the jungle explodes. The sound and lighting were amazing. One can say that the dialouges were pretty overrated and in the Redux it got boring but overall it was good movie. My grandpa was a LT. in a grunt outfit in Vietnam and he goes very depressed when someone brings up Vietnam. So I guess, they saw really bad things there but the movie could have gone faster and had, not so overrated, dialouges"

","I would like to submit the following goof.<br/><br/>During the bridge scene, soldiers are seen wading out in the river, asking to be taken away and seeking to escape. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases. Soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone. They have duffel bags, packs and footlockers but not suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping. Additionally, if you look closely, you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water. This is probably a very good indication that it is empty,otherwise it would sink."
"DeeNine-2","10","1","2","10 April 2006"," Coppola's phantasmagoric ode to the madness of war
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>War is a kind of madness. It has its own logic. Kill or be killed. Follow orders, follow the leader. Go crazy. Do horrific things. Become a beast. Do all of this in a steamy jungle amid a alien culture for an unclear purpose in an ineffective way and you've got some idea of what Vietnam was like. Coppola's Vietnam is the Vietnam of a soldier's Thai stick/acid trip. The filming actually took place in the Phillippines, but no matter: that's better than Kubrick's excellent Full Metal Jacket which was partially filmed on constructed sets in England of all places.<br/><br/>The jungle is dark and green and deep and unbelievable lush, filled with snakes and tigers, insects that bite and swarm, bats and spiders and little tan men who dig tunnels and can't be seen. You shoot at the jungle, and you shoot and shoot and shoot. And you can imagine the effect it has. Like trying to kill flies with a .357 Magnum. Which is what we tried to do in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Army Capt Ben Willard (Martin Sheen) on R and R in a Saigon hotel, going stir crazy, drinking Martell Cordon Bleu and passing out, gets a knock on the door. He has orders: go up river into Cambodia and terminate an army colonel (Marlon Brando) who has gone AWOL. Oh, and by the way, Colonel Kurtz in his charismatic madness has built his own little unauthorized empire in the jungle, fortified with crazed admirers. You might want to approach with caution.<br/><br/>So this is the plot: a quest to a forbidden land with fantastic adventures along the way providing us with a view of the war from a gunboat. The flares at night, the ""purple haze,"" the tracers flying at the boat, the fog, the black nights, the little things the men do to retain some semblance of sanity, smoke a jay, polish your boots, reread a letter from home.<br/><br/>And then there is the ordinary madness of the war lover personified in Robert Duvall's swashbuckling army colonel who likes to take off his shirt and watch his men surf the waves as all about him bombs are bursting and bullets flying. But he never flinches because to flinch would show weakness and possibly a lack of love for what one is doing. In one of the most memorable lines in all of filmdom, Duvall declares, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like victory."" Well, there was no victory. There was only the blood and the bombs, the jungle that could not be beaten back or Agent Orange'd enough, the mud and Charlie, always Charlie hidden somewhere, disguised or invisible and unkillable, like a hydra-headed monster, and dead bodies of your buddies on their way back to the land of the big PXs in body bags. And yet there is always the mission, and so upstream Willard goes. And the more he reads about Col Kurtz the more he admires the man. And then when he gets there, the question arises, how can he penetrate the Colonel's jungle fortress? He has been advised, belatedly, aboard the boat when it was too late to turn back and refuse the mission, that he had a predecessor, someone else sent to terminate Colonel Kurtz. So Colonel Kurtz will know why you, Capt Willard, are coming to visit.<br/><br/>He calls you a messenger boy. You are put in a bamboo cage. A photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) turned worshipful admirer of the Colonel gives you water, lights a cigarette and puts it in your mouth. Delirious dreams and phantasmagoric nightmares, surreal imaginings and the haunting face of Kurtz and his poetry, quoting T.S. Eliot and Andrew Marvel, flood your mind. You have called an air strike should you not return, and then--was it a dream or was it real?--the head of the soldier who would call the strike is delivered to you on a banana leaf--something like that happened or didn't and maybe you will soon be, or already are, as mad as the Colonel.<br/><br/>Coppola and crew spent two years in the jungle filming this. It is a great epic of mystery and beauty, a fantastic picture of the war, part brutal reality, part imagined enchantment with fascinating characters indelibly spun out by one of the greatest of all film makers. By all means see this for Francis Ford Coppola, one of the few directors who could be considered a genius."
"bartverberne16","10","1","2","15 October 2005"," Apocalypse Now; This is the way the world ends
","Capt. Willard is sent on a mission in Vietnam to kill a man named Kurtz whose methods in the war became 'unsound'. Kurtz is a former officer who settled himself somewhere in Cambodia on the end of the Nung River, deep in the jungle. This film follows Capt. Willard on his seemingly endless journey on the Nung River that leads to the Colonel. On his journey Willard slowly becomes absorbed by Kurtz' life story and especially, his philosophy. Director Brian de Palma shows his true excellence in filming this trip; it is everything that film is supposed to be. It is full of tension and the dialogs are unforgettable. Not to mention the last 30 minutes of the film, which is to me the best ending to a film I have ever seen. When Kurtz (Brando) starts his monologue about the inoculated children, I sizzled. It was just great. The intriguing thing is that if you take your time to absorb the dialogs then you slowly start to comprehend what Kurtz had gone through. Apocalypse Now is definitely a work of art.<br/><br/>About the Redux version; many people are not pleased with the added scenes. Partly I agree, since why would we change something what is already perfect? On the other hand, the extra scenes are interesting when you concentrate on them; at least, that is what I think."
"Balthazar-5","9","1","2","28 September 2005"," A beautifully-structured metaphor for America in Viet Nam
","I can claim to be one of the first people to see Apocalypse Now - at the Cannes press-show - and it remains one of the most memorable filmic events of my life. The film announces its intention from the very beginning - 'This is the end...', the opening line of 'The End' by The Doors. A film that begins with that kind of irony is going to be some work, and so it is.<br/><br/>Though based on 'Heart of Darkness', I think that the war is so brilliantly embedded in the film that its debt to Conrad is small. In fact, for me, it supersedes Conrad, as his journey is primarily metaphysical. Here we have a metaphysical journey, but one which is totally infused with the greatest of all human 'darknesses' - war.<br/><br/>At the centre of the film is Martin Sheen's magnificent performance as Willard. Nearly everything Sheen has done has been wonderful, but here he is as close to perfect as we can expect from an actor - making sense of even his totally 'fou' opening scene.<br/><br/>Then there is the structure of the characters. The occupants of the boat are basically a cross-section of American society - hailing from the 'four corners' of the country - Chief Phillips comes from the north - Chicago, Chef from the south, Lance isfrom the west coast, and 'Clean' from the east. And Willard, he is from Iowa - in the heart of the continent. Here the film is showing us that the entire nation was involved in the war.<br/><br/>So who do we thank for Apocalypse Now's wonders? My own inclination is to give, perhaps, the lion's share of the credit to John Milius - the allegoric structure of the film is also not far from the methods of 'Big Wednesday'.<br/><br/>Are there problems? Yes. Sometimes it goes over the top - I think the Kilgore surfing scene is made more of than was necessary, the whole war is lunacy without underscoring it quite so firmly. Similarly the Playboy Bunnies sequence is also grotesque. I do not deny that value of humour in such an allegory, but I am a little uneasy about the glib way in which it is introduced.<br/><br/>And the sense of impending doom is magnificently presented, with scenes like the encounter with the tiger resonating with all of the major primal fears of our species. (Does the tiger itself have a symbolic function? It is an interesting speculation.) As the boat approaches Kurtz' camp, the horrors simply expand and deepen. To my mind, Kurtz is being represented as that part of the human psyche that rejects rationality, and that is exactly the psyche that embraces war.<br/><br/>Finally Willard succeeds in his mission, but at what cost...<br/><br/>This is, as I said, some film.<br/><br/>Oh, yes. Marlon Brando plays Colonel Kurtz and gives him a depth and complexity that would have totally escaped lesser actors."

","Being rather messy, it is a very good war film with lots of surreal twists and memorable characters. The helicopters attack scene is definitely one of the finest with a very proper soundtrack as a background.<br/><br/>It is a USA film devoid of patriotism. At certain points of the film the long running time of the redux version is a torture because it contains two embarrassing episodes: the one with the ""Playboy"" girls and the other – with the veiled smoking-sex scene in the French camp (?). More tough and mindless action scenes would be more suitable than these prolonged kiss-and-hug mishmash.<br/><br/>The main spoilers of this message are the following hints on how to make the best of ""Apocalypse Now"" viewing. Suppose that the movie should be a grand voyage with a glass of vodka consumed just before the opening scene. The TV colours are to be tuned to the maximum. The home phone must be unplugged, the mobile one - switched off, the door bell – disconnected. The windows - properly shut to keep all the street noises outside. And skip the two scenes mentioned above.<br/><br/>The abominable and suicidal redux cut of this ""death card"" movie still deserves a reliable 8 out of 10. Thanks for attention."
"alankbeck","9","1","2","18 July 2005"," Apocalypse Now - Vietnam being the perfect setting for the Heart of Darkness
","In contrast to the review by Donald J. Lamb from Philadelphia, PA I feel that Vietnam really was the perfect setting to re-render Conrad's The Heart of Darkness in the modern era. The point about US adventures in Vietnam - like European adventures in Africa in the late nineteenth century - was that the darkness at the heart of Vietnam/Cambodia (and Africa) was none other then the projected shadow of imperialism itself. As such it is an excellent war movie, showing the futility, degradation, and degenerative effects of war upon the psyche and cohesion of both individuals minds (soldiers, captains and generals) and communities (Cambodian villagers).<br/><br/>Its use of the Door's ""The End"" in the napalm sequences testifies to the simple but terrifying truth about the nature of genocide, while the Wagner blaring from speakers placed on U.S. helicopters about to blow up a Vietnamese village is symbolic of the militaristic egotism with which the Calvary division take up their own act of genocide (reflecting the militaristic egotism of Wagner's own music and attitudes). The soldier surfing to the Stone's ""Satisfaction"" is - in relative terms - a light rendering of the frustrations, and delusions of denial suffered by GIs in the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>It really is a great film - although Donald seems to have missed the point of it. Its not an expression about the directors madness, but about the collective madness, delusion and suffering that war brings about in ourselves (as conquerors) and others (as conquered). As Willard says (in the narrative) in the movie where the conquerors can go home, the conquered have only two choices, to die or to win."
"LordAndrew","Null","1","2","1 July 2005"," Kurtz's Final Judgment
","As a huge fan of the novella, and someone who actually understands it, maybe it isn't fair for me to comment on this movie. Even if the movie had been done correctly, and had done justice to the book, I probably wouldn't have been all that happy with it. But even so, I think I have the right to complain when a deep and though provoking story, with a fairly clear message, is drained of all meaning in the movie version.<br/><br/>In the novel Kurtz's dying words, ""The Horror, the Horror"" were a summing up of everything the story was saying. That man is basically evil, our hearts are black, all we seek is our own pleasure, and that the only thing keeping us from becoming savages ourselves are the carefully placed guidelines of society.<br/><br/>The movie isn't so clear about ""The Horror"" line. As near as I can tell, and from talking to people who haven't had the pleasure of reading the novel, ""the horror"" is referring to war itself. My response to this is ""duhhhhhhhh."" Of course war is horrible. The movie should have ended after it's only brilliant scene that makes this abundantly clear. The scene where the soldiers kill a child after she makes a silly move to save the life of her pet puppy. Now do you really need to be told that war is horrible after this? Is that a conclusion you need some help to reach? If it is then you're a moron!"
"mrx-14","10","1","2","15 June 2005"," A Most Important Film
","Many have made comments about the high quality of many different aspects of the film from direction, to acting, to screen writing, to cinematography, however I would like to concentrate on an aspect of the film which I have not seen discussed. Simply that it stands as a film version in the lineage of the most important of human mythic stories which extends back in time through Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness""(for which it admits to being a loose adaptation), to Dante's ""Inferno"", to Homer's ""Illiad"" and ""Odyssey"", which make it more than a simple war movie...<br/><br/>The film was actually a major start to my interest in such things as the human mythic as well as any number of offshoot interests.<br/><br/>What I want to convey is the important use of symbolic visual imagery that Coppola gets (or perhaps even finds) in the film. Knowing that he went to the edge and fought constantly with adversity in making this film, I'm consistently amazed at the film for its mythic genius in terms of both planned and unplanned aspects. As to the latter idea, I'm drawn to the early seen where Sheen, playing one of the main characters, Willard, punches a mirror, highly symbolic, yet as I know it the scene was unplanned that way, and Sheen in fact really is quite drunk, drunk enough to destroy his own image. That the movie kicks off in this powerfully symbolic, yet unplanned way, is quite fitting in my opinion.<br/><br/>Other symbolic details include Willard killing of a tiger in the jungle with a machine-gun, a powerful symbol of man in his most modern placement in his battle against nature. The tiger has no chance.<br/><br/>One should also notice when Willard first meets Kilgore, that a cow is being airlifted from the mopping up of this battle, even as a military chaplain is performing mass. The symbolic reference is to the sacred cow and the lunar bull cult and one can make a tie with these ideas and other works of art, notably Picasso's ""Guernica"". Still, even in the movie this cow basically symbolically reappears as the cow slaughtered near the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Another detail is the appearance of Frazier's ""The Golden Bough"" in Kurtz's quarters, illuminated for a moment and foreshadowing the conflict which will shortly take place between Kurtz and Willard. Too, then it should be noted that Kurtz deftly ducks Willards initial strike before standing up to face, and take, the death blow.<br/><br/>The movie may not be perfect, but it is these things, these many fine details along with other more obviously cinematic ones, which take some time to uncover, which give the movie a mythical depth rarely attempted and almost never achieved in a major movie and which also lends to the movies rare status of rewarding repeated viewings along with research into what such symbolism might mean. For me the movie is only rivaled by ""Bladerunner"" in these terms, and probably has more overall power being more grounded in historical reality and thus more accessible to more people.<br/><br/>Those who can watch the movie with a depth of vision and with an eye to the mythical history and nature of man find the movie to return a reward that few if any movies can match."

","I bought the DVD and kept it for 3 years in my collection. Finally thought I was in the right mood to watch it last night. I have mixed feelings about this movie. I think we have been spoiled by recent war movies that puts the viewer right in the action - started as Saving Private Ryan, then recently Black Hawk Down, The fire fights were so intense in these movies you feel exhausted after that. Apocalypse Now was made in the older style, but I think it was cutting edge for its day. Note the helicopter attack sequences had lots of long shots and wide angles, you have a 'birds eye view' but do not feel that you are in the thick of the battle. No feeling of bullets whizzing past like Forrest Gump. As a Vietnam War Movie, I thought it was rather abstract. The characters were extreme and did not have the realism of Platoon, or even We Were Soldiers in its depiction of real soldiers. This unrealism gets more extreme towards the ending, and I wasn't sure if it ended up like Mad Max meets Planet of the Apes there. I think this was intended no doubt, but I was expecting more realism. This made the violence unreal and I couldn't connect with that. e.g. decapitated heads should have been gruesome, but in the context of the surreal camp grounds, it had as much effect on me as an Orc head from the Lord of the Rings. Sorry, but I do have a big problem with the ending sequence The cinematography was good, but some night shots had too much glare and lens flare from spotlights."

The guy was dead by 1925, so presumably the slash-and-burn of his carefully worded novel was authorised via a spiritualist?<br/><br/>Nevertheless the book has a purpose, plot and a climax; something that the real Vietnam lacked: A war started and waged by people who knew or cared little about Asia and couldn't even tell you - in a sentence - what they hoped to achieve by waging it! <br/><br/>(Stopping internal Communism by military invasion is rather like trying to stop Italy being catholic at the point of a gun!)<br/><br/>We all know the danger of war looking like fun and AN fights it by showing that you can't - in modern battle - really trust anybody. Friend or foe. Comedian Spike Milligan once joked that he had a hard WWII because he was ""shot at by both sides."" Lead Martin Sheen probably can identify with this joke! <br/><br/>There are no scenes I actually dislike, but there is plenty that I don't understand. Famously Sheen appears out of water carrying a knife in full battle paint - but why? Because it looks clever? I also don't understand a lot of his actions anyway, especially towards the end - unless what he does is under a coverall of mental breakdown. <br/><br/>I would also like a bit more explanation about Colonel Kurtz (Brando) and his background. I am told the Redux version has more footage set in the jungle camp - but I have never seen it. Isn't this a classic case of cinematography taken over from story? He has gone mad because mad wars send people mad. Isn't there time for further detail and explanation in a two and a half hour of film?<br/><br/>(We are reduced to listening to a drugged out hippie - Dennis Hopper - for extra detail and insight!)<br/><br/>We are lucky in having some fine actors on show to disguise the nonsense and the murk - including the memorable Robert Duvall down by the beach. He tells us that Napalm ""smells like victory,"" while in reality it smells a lot like spilt petrol. They should have made AN a ""scratch and sniff"" movie!<br/><br/>(A horrible and desperate chemical weapon that dominated a horrible and desperate war. Destroying a country in order to save it!)<br/><br/>The film was helped on its way to becoming a classic by being about depression, alienation and loneliness. Any poll of film shows (and IMDb is the biggest) shows these topics to be especially important. If marks count for anything. <br/><br/>(The world loves a comedy or a musical - but look how rarely a comedy or a musical wins open film awards.)<br/><br/>We have a great cast and we are on the road (or is it river?) to meeting the now late Marlon Brando - although we are really supposed to believe he is a character other than Brando. A Brando gone mad maybe? It can't be meant as a surprise because his image dominates the poster.<br/><br/>Brando showed through his onset actions (which you can read about elsewhere) that he had no respect for director Coppola and no respect for the film.Yet he captures and dominates the screen like no American actor could or probably ever will again - bar, maybe, Orson Wells.<br/><br/>At the end things blow up - not because it is in the script or was planned that way - but because the sets had to be destroyed and this was filmed. The Doors music plays against these images like a dream and you conclude that this is what death would really be like - if only death had taken lessons in drama and cinematography."

He hitches a ride with the crew of a patrol boat. The crew (Albert Hall, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms and Fishburne) deal with the situation in different ways (Bottoms seems to be high all through the film, which he REALLY was)as they travel into the depths of hell to get to Kurtz, who is worshiped as a god by the inhabitants (Including Dennis Hopper as a photojournalist who is really out there).<br/><br/>The most famous scene of course is when the crew encounters Lt.Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall)who blows up villages while Wagner's ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" is blasting through the speakers of the attacking helicopters. That scene alone makes you wonder if the war in general was pure madness: Kilgore becomes more concerned about surfing than doing his job.<br/><br/>For those who are still avoiding seeing this version of a classic, put your fears to rest and rent it tonight."

If you haven't seen the movie and you're here reading this, you've read the hype already. People will preach to you about how this is an anti-war movie or an anti-Nam movie. These are the narrow-minded and short-sighted who fail to see the big picture. Thats not to say they're wrong, but they're missing the point. This movie is a commentary on humanity, not one short function of life known as war. <br/><br/>Its not the violence of war that throws Kurtz off the deep end. The war simply provides as a backdrop. Society and human nature is the culprit here. Coppola is not attempting to show us the horror of war, hes showing us the horror of man's violent nature.<br/><br/>Back to the movie itself. I've noticed my favorite films all have narrations by the main character (Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, American Beauty are some examples). This movie tops them all in that aspect. Coppolla uses the narration and psyche of Willard to create and detail the character of Kurtz.<br/><br/>We only know of Kurtz that Willard knows, and the suspense is amazing. No one can watch this movie and not be drawn to this character. <br/><br/>Along the way we are taken through hell on the banks of a river. One cant help but wonder what would cause humans to behave in such a way or subject themselves to such conditions. My example here is the bridge scene. You have a group of human beings in a world of s**t. Their existence has been reduced to nothing. They are only there to kill VC's. Their once normal lives back home no longer exist. They are too deep to ever go back. <br/><br/>I bought the Redux version of this film, and I think it makes the original seem more perfect. Every scene that was cut didn't belong. These scenes offered us a more personal look at Willard, and offers more compassion towards him as having a human side (when he steals the surfboard or gets close to the French woman). I personally prefer the cold, stoic character I came to know from the original. It gives the film a darker sense and does more for me. Had the movie been released in Redux, i doubt id feel the same way about it. Kudos to Coppola for knowing what to remove."

","The greatest war movie ever - the helicopter attack is still one of the great set pieces in cinema history, Robert Duvall with one of the most quoted lines in cinema history, and a film that captures the overriding insanity that war is propelled by and generates. Martin Sheen's performance has always been undervalued in this film - he is the heart of the movie, as he his dragged further and further into the nightmare of Vietnam - he is a professional solider, a special forces officer but even he is overwhelmed by the chaos caused by Kurtz in what was the hidden war on the Cambodian border. Sheen is a great actor and vividly portrays a character who has been finally been submerged by the horror and brutality of the American policy towards the Vietnam conflict. Brando is on a different planet, but that is the intention, given Kurtz has become completely removed mentally from the war around him."

","Apocalypse Now is an excellent film. Like other -specially about Vietnam-, I don't think is a war movie. Its a movie that deeply reflects on war brutality. At this point, I see Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Martin Sheen at their very best. This detail also make a huge difference with ""Heart of Darkness"", the novel of Conrad. I'm pretty sure that ""Apocalypse Now"" should be remembered for the reflection without concessions on all the war stuff. Of course, is not a commercial movie. Maybe for this, we should thanks Francis Ford Coppola. Is there many guys ready for movies like this, in this days?"
"paul2001sw-1","8","1","2","2 March 2004"," Apocalypse then
","Francis Ford Coppola was at the height of his powers when he decided to make his gramatically-challenged film 'Apocalypse Now', which pivots around the brilliant idea of using Joseph Conrad's novel 'Heart of Darkness', about Kurtz, a capable and idealistic colonialist gone mad in deepest Africa, as a metaphor for the Vietnam war.  It should also have been the first major American film to address that difficult subject, but it was subject to numerous, infamous delays in production and was not finished until 1979, by which time other films (like 'The Deer Hunter' or, indirectly, 'Taxi Driver') had already addressed the same subject.  What remains is a wildly ambitious film of vast scope, full of astonishing images but possessed of a certain fundamental silliness in a way that 'The Deer Hunter', for example, completely avoids.  Having read the book since I first saw the film, however, one surprising discovery is that the incoherence and relative absence of closure, which some may consider faults, actually derive from the source material.<br/><br/>Viewed solely as cinema, 'Apocalypse Now' is a flawed but original, thought-provoking and and highly distinctive piece of film.  But it's also interesting in terms of where it fits into the (by now, very well defined) genre of Vietnam movies.  The classic narrative now avoids the political question (should the war have been fought?) to concentrate on the hardships of the (mainly working class) young soldiers whose misfortune was to have to fight it.  'Apocalypse Now', although not overtly political itself, is arguably a stronger film than most, because it does not allow its protagonists to escape personal responsibility for their actions: the draftees may have been victims, but they were perpetrators too, and the film recognises the duality.  However, this does not make it a peacenik anti-war flick.  Coppola cleverly borrows the ambivalence that Marlowe, Conrad's narrator, has towards Kurtz, for his own narrator Willard.  Willard's (and Kurtz's) hatred of the war as is manifests itself in split emotions, one peaceable and the other hostile, the urge to destroy, to kill, to fight hard and with ""clarity"" of purpose - rather like the Viet Kong - with the implication that this way the war could have been won.  This double psychology is central to the mood of the whole story, and is a convincing mindset for these two professional soldiers.  But perhaps also serves to make the film slightly more palatable to its domestic audience, allowing the viewer to take away the message of their choice.  Another observation is that the portrayal of the ""natives"" is scarcely more advanced than it was in Conrad's book - the Vietnamese appear as little more than romantic savages, and others have commented how the largely uninhabited jungles through which Willard travels ignore the reality of densely populated Vietnam.  As with 'Heart of Darkness', 'Apocalypse Now' is best seen as a fable, that asks questions about the behaviour of supposedly civilised men, but which operates within terms of reference that the same men would recognise.<br/><br/>The final word must be on Marlon Brando, who is surely the perfect embodiment of the enigmatic Kurtz.  His is a great performance, though it doesn't last long - a shame, for he holds the screen with a quiet brilliance."

"MeanderingMegan","Null","1","2","3 August 2002"," Commenting on Apocalypse Now Redux, Not the Original
","I'm sure a couple of people would probably shoot me for this, but after seeing the 'new' version of Apocalypse Now that screened at Cannes last year, I was really disappointed that Francis Ford Coppola took what was, in my opinion, a perfect masterpiece and added so much more footage to the movie.  The thing that was so absolutely chilling and chaotic about the original was all the little spaces left where one understood the insanity and chaos of the war but did not get straight linear explanations for each step of it.  To me, not having been around for the war, it gave me (what I felt like to be) a really guttural feeling for just how confusing, violent and generally f*cked up the whole Vietnam experience was.  How difficult it was to figure who the bad guys were and who were innocent.  It brought up the pivotal question ""What is this war really about?""  I was truly mesmerized by the film and walked away with alot of compassion for both the men that fought in Vietnam and the innocent locals that got caught in the middle.  I also walked away with so many moral, ethical and psychological conflicts as to everything that went down there and found myself wondering how anyone who was involved with this war on either side could possibly come out any other way but scarred.<br/><br/>For me, Coppola diluted his film by redoing it and adding the extra footage. It took away it's strongest point - that of being a film that put you in the experience but made no overt statements about it - thus making the strongest statement possible.  What I walked away with after watching the recut is a little too much indicating and less of the chaos that made this film the classic that it is.  My advice to Coppola?  Don't mess with a good thing.  Sometimes things should be left well enough alone."
"bwaynef","Null","1","2","27 March 1999"," A wandering elephant
","""My movie is not ABOUT Vietnam,"" Francis Ford Coppola said at a press conference during the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.  ""It IS Vietnam.""  The men who actually fought that never officially declared war may disagree that ""Apocalypse Now,"" the movie is question, is what its director claimed, but there are similarities.  Like Vietnam, this film is long, pointless and costly.  It opens impressively, if pretentiously, with Lt. Willard, the almost ghostly protagonist, sprawled across a bed in a Saigon hotel room, mumbling through a voiceover reminiscent of a 1940s private eye movie, while helicopters are superimposed over his sweat-beaded face.  Before the scene concludes, Willard (Martin Sheen), seemingly suffers a nervous breakdown, smashing his hand through a mirror, then sinking to the floor, sobbing as The Doors perform ""The End"" on the soundtrack.  This surreal moment soon gives way to a scene that could have been lifted from a dozen James Bond movies:  Willard is ordered to track down and kill Colonel Kurtz, a mysterious figure who has established a military outpost that acknowledges no rule but his own.  What follows are some spectacular battle scenes, some good acting (Robert Duvall), some bad acting (Frederic Forrest), and some acting leftover from ""Easy Rider"" ten years earlier (Dennis Hopper), all of it as disconnected as the war itself.  When Willard finally confronts Colonel Kurtz, we find Marlon Brando, his head shaved and his enormous bulk swamped in shadows, lethargically mumbling incoherent dialogue that, instead of tying up loose ends, leaves them dangling as precariously than ever. The final moments are so darkly lit, it's debatable whether Willard carries out his mission or not. Peopled by actors who made their name in films with which Coppola was associated (Duvall, Forrest, Harrison Ford), or found renewed popularity under his direction (Brando), this is the biggest home movie ever made. It is essentially a vanity production fueled by the director's enormous ego. Who else but an egomaniac would make a comment like the one Coppola made at Cannes?  The true star of ""Apocalypse Now,"" however, is not Coppola or Brando, but Vittorio Storaro whose cinematography almost makes this wandering elephant worthwhile."
"b-a-h TNT-6","10","1","2","4 May 2002"," It'll take you out there.
","Capt. Willard: ""They told me that you had gone... totally insane... and that your methods were unsound.""<br/><br/>Col. Kurtz: ""Are my methods unsound?""<br/><br/>Capt. Willard: ""I don't see... any methods... at all, sir.""<br/><br/>Ah, Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite war film of all time.<br/><br/>Coming from the huge success of The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II, Francis Coppola was offered the possibility to direct a big-budget epic about the Vietnam war. Did I say big-budget and about the Vietnam war? Ok, I have come up with only a couple of statements and there is something to say already. While the planned budget for the film was undoubtedly large, the process of filming it was a true Odyssey; endless problems, including but not limited to a typhoon that destroyed most of the sets, difficulties with the authorities of the Philippines (where the film was shot), and personal problems with the actors and the crew, brought the costs sky high, and the shooting process from the scheduled six weeks up to 16 months. In case you are interested, there is a 1991 documentary titled Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse that is said to narrate the incredible adventure that the making of the film was, and how Coppola himself at the end was almost physically, financially and psychologically devastated. Sadly, I have not been able to see the aforementioned documentary, but it must be definitely worth a look if you are a fan of Coppola or filmmaking in general.<br/><br/>While Apocalypse Now's context is strongly related to the Vietnam war, its ambitions are higher and its implications much broader: it is not simply an opera about Vietnam, it is an adventure in human insanity where war is only part of it. Perhaps the most interesting quality of the film is that, far more than any other war movies I have seen, it works perfectly on multiple levels; on a more immediate level, it is a depiction of the struggles, the bad judgments, and the madness of the battlefield. On further analysis, it is a metaphorical, visceral adventure into the depths of the darkest side of the human mind, a trip that's most definitely open to many different interpretations and opinions. Of course, like in every masterpiece, the two layers complement each other perfectly and reflect one another, building a memorable picture of intense emotional power. Simply put, Apocalypse Now successfully goes where other popular war movies such as Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket fail to go, or more realistically (pun somewhat intended) just don't have the ambition to go.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now liberally adapts Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness, transplanting it into the chaos of the Vietnam war circa 1969. The main character is Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) of US Army Intelligence. Willard has already carried out ""assassinations"" for the Government and is, his own way, almost a war victim; he is alive, but he feels soulless, and his perspective for a regular life seems lost forever -- especially after the divorce from his wife, which he blames for the greater part on himself. In Saigon, he is handed a mission. Out there in Cambodia, the former outstanding officer Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) has stopped following the orders and is now conducting his own personal, ferocious war with his own army, who apparently worship him like a god; he is operating ""beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct"" and, as General R. Corman (G.D. Spradlin) informs Willard, his command must be terminated. Kurtz must be terminated. With extreme prejudice. Willard will have to track the Colonel by riding a small boat upriver with a few soldiers, then kill him. A long dossier on Kurtz is handed to Willard so that he'll be able to understand what is going on in Kurtz's mind.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the most memorable characters in Apocalypse Now is William Kilgore (Robert Duvall), the loud-mouthed Colonel whose orders are to transport and escort Willard and his boat crew for a brief period. Kilgore is just about the complete opposite of Kurtz, but he is almost as scary. The famous sequence where he orders to play Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries during an air raid is without a doubt an immortal piece of cinema, and the same can be said about his infamous quote, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning... It smells like... victory.""<br/><br/>Speaking of memorable scenes, there are so many that I just don't know where to begin; the film is visually a real tour de force. The opening, with The Door's ""The End"" playing while we are witnessing the destruction of a portion of jungle, sets the mood with apocalyptic undertones that will only grow stronger as the movie progresses; the near-riot caused by a Playboy show plays like a dream sequence, and seems to underline the progressive detachment from sanity and rational thoughts; the tragic consequences of the boat's crew incompetence in dealing with a simple canoe is a heartbreaking moment where personal regret and the horror of amoral choices come stronger than ever. Probably most riveting of all are the shocking images of an army without commanding officer and completely on the loose in a remote outpost.<br/><br/>The pacing is perfect. As we crawl along the river, we experience an ever-deepening spiral into darkness, madness, and seemingly unreal events; the conduction of war is taking wrong turns on all parts and Willard is progressively descending into mental instability. Like Kurtz, Willard is appalled by the incompetence and the horror surrounding him; the boat crew is slowly killed off one by one.<br/><br/>Col. Kurtz's compound is, quite literally, the end of the river: the last stage of madness, or the ultimate bowel of hell on Earth. And yet, it is strangely fascinating. Kurtz is part demon, part prophet. He has, quite simply, stopped questioning the morality of his choices and now lives and acts following the rules of the jungle. In many ways, Kurtz represents Willard's inner demon, and the final scene where Willard has to become Kurtz to get rid of him and what he represents is, in my opinion, absolutely outstanding.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent on all parts. Martin Sheen's restrained performance perfectly fits the emotionally disrupted Capt. Willard, and his voice-over does not feel obtrusive or grow boring. Marlon Brando is great as the man whose soul has hit rock bottom, Kurtz, and Robert Duvall offers what is possibly his best performance to date (ok, together with The Godfather). The supporting cast (that includes Frederic Forrest, Dennis Hopper, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, and Sam Bottoms) never fails.<br/><br/>One particular mention goes to the soundtrack. The mix of rock tunes and atmospheric sounds works in a magnificent way creating a mix of real/surreal that's been rarely matched in the history of cinema."
"peterperezus","8","1","2","15 September 2001"," Epic about Vietnam
","This is a ground breaking visionary film.  The acting is excellent.  I do have some problems with it, however.  Martin Sheen's character does not desend into madness as I think was intended - he is already there from the beginning.  I think the film would much more powerful if we saw this change in him as he got sucked deeper and deeper into the Heart of Darkness as the film progresses.  As it is, it is hard to identify with or relate to any of the characters.  I think some people like the ambiguity of the film, but I suspect that ambiguity stems from the divergent political viewpoints of the writers, Milius and Coppola, as opposed to it being carefully and purposely structured into the story.  Having said all that, it is quite an impressive piece of work."

","Really long movie just got longer!  I must have checked my watch in disbelief about 15 times.  And it's not like I hadn't seen the original several times.  I remember saying at one point, ""I think it's getting close to wrapping up,"" and seeing that it had only been one hour and seven minutes (out of three hours and fifteen minutes).  And now I unleash this really long review upon you.  Happy mulling.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, would you believe that I loved it, too?  I was blown away! ""Apocalypse Now"" is one of my favorite movies and it is now even more so.<br/><br/>True, it's not the most uplifting of movies.  But, obviously, it's not supposed to be.<br/><br/>And, while most of the ideas bandied about are very interesting and compelling, the truth is that the message of the movie is pretty unclear. Sure, we're all programmed to assume that wanton violence is meant to remind us that war is hell and inane military leaders are used to remind us that absolute power corrupts absolutely and that ANY Vietnam movie is meant to remind us that, while war is bad, Vietnam was REALLY bad.  But what does ""Apocalypse Now"" really mean?<br/><br/>One of the interesting aspects of the film is how appealing each of the main characters is and (as they dominate the screen) how sensible their ideologies sound:<br/><br/>WILLARD-""Bent"" but likeable, (even more so in REDUX).  Pretty much a cypher, though.  Most everything is ""done unto"" him (even his hand is forced in the climactic killing of Kurtz) but still a compelling ""Ishmael"" to guide us on our Odyssey.<br/><br/>IDEOLOGY- This war is bulls***.  We shouldn't be here.  Though billed by the government and the press as such, this war is not sane or decent.  It is hell!  The charges against Kurtz are bogus.  Kurtz's actions are inevitable in an environment so insane.  Nevertheless, if my orders are to kill him than that's what I'm gonna do.  Plus I'll kill anyone that gets in my way of doing so (however innocent).  Orders are orders.<br/><br/>CORMAN(The Lieutenant-General that commissions Willard's mission)- His monologue about the dark side sometimes winning out over what Lincoln called, ""the better angels of our nature"" is one of he film's best.  He sounds sensible and sympathetic as he decrees that Kurtz must be terminated. His reservation is palpable.  Even his homey directions regarding passing the food both ways to save time add to his multi-dimensional (however short) role.<br/><br/>IDEOLOGY-We are going to win this war and we are going to do it because God and our government require us to do the right thing even though it may require much sacrifice.  While we must fight in this war, we must remain faithful to the guidelines of conduct established by the US Military and to the mores given us by God.<br/><br/>KILGORE-Psycho but absolutely charismatic.  A complete idiot who was born for this conflict and laments the fact that ""someday this war's gonna end"". He loves his men and loves this war.<br/><br/>IDEOLOGY-I like to kill!  I also like to surf!  I love my good ol' American boys and I'm gonna watch over them and make sure that them damn gooks don't hurt 'em and if they do...God help 'em.<br/><br/>KURTZ-Beautiful and brilliant.  His description of the Ohio river and the plantation that looked like ""heaven had fallen on the earth in the form of gardenias"" and his recounting of the VC reaction to the inoculation of their babies are enthralling.  ""I cried...I cried like some grandmother.  I didn't know what I wanted to do.  I wanted to tear my teeth out.""  I could listen to him muse forever.  You can see why Hopper's character was so enamoured with him.  And yet, there is no doubt, that Kurtz is absolutely insane. And not in a glorified, ""so close to God he's crazy"" way either.  We're talking murderously psychotic.<br/><br/>IDEOLOGY:  We can not win this war or any other unless we truly unleash our id (on command) and become primeval killing animals (just as the VC does). Our problem, then is not that we are fighting this war but that we're not doing it well enough.<br/><br/>NOTE:  The restored love scene (complete with psychotic ""Fantasy Island"" music) with the French woman also carries this point home.  ""You are two people: a lover and a killer, a god and a beast."" (paraphrase)<br/><br/>As is the case in any great movie, each of these parts is played as if the actors truly believe in their roles and in the ideologies that motivate their characters.  The problem is that all these conflicting ideologies are directed as if Coppola truly believes them all to be true too.  As you watch ""Apocalypse Now"", you can't help but utter that banal statement we've all caught ourselves saying, ""Hm, this movie is important.""  But, at the same time, you have to ask yourself, ""Now, what the hell does it mean?""<br/><br/>Of course, as will always be the case with the enigmatic, the question is: Is it truly ambiguous or am I just an idiot?  And then, if it is ambiguous, is that a strength, weakness, or both?<br/><br/>I think (if possible) it is both.<br/><br/>I guess when you come right down to it ""Apocalypse Now"" is what Vietnam must have been: terrifying and confusing.  In that respect it will always be one of the best and most indelible portrayals of this war."

","I realize that I'm in the minority on Coppola. His sensibility is melodramatic and his penchant for freakishness is annoyingly distracting. I am also bothered by his frequent resort to bizarre camera angles and extreme lighting effects. For example, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is introduced at the beginning of the film with his head upside down on the screen while a dream- scape of attack helicopters and napalm bombs rushes through his mind, frequently obscuring his face. Toward the end of the film, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), whom Willard has been pursuing under orders to assassinate him, is introduced in blackness and only gradually emerges into light in an overly l-o-n-g scene. Among the freaks in this film are Robert Duvall as a commander of a helicopter attack squadron who likes to wear a horse-cavalry cowboy hat and is obsessed with surfing and Dennis Hopper as a crazed cameraman whom Willard finds among Colonel Kurtz's devoted followers. Coppola's visual imagination, which served him well in the Godfather films, undermines Apocalypse Now in my estimation. It was a VIOLENTLY successful film but the moral which is supposed to be at the center of this film is deeply buried under costly (but ultimately cheap) directorial trickery."

Has to be thankful that my DVD player allows me to watch these kind of ending with double or even quadruple speed. Couple classic scenes and characters and nothing else. And there is better +three-hour movies out there than this one (like each one in LOTR -series)."

As for Brando, it's The Godfather meets Moby Dick--and overblown, incomprehensible performance, much like the movie itself.  If you want to see a movie about 'Nam, Full Metal Jacket is a much better bet."

","Firstly: I did see ""Apocalypse Now"" in 1979, on one of the two biggest screens ever built in Australia. It was amazing, if flawed. It is also, I hate so say, the best version done of ""Apocalypse"".<br/><br/>""Redux"" (circa 2001) had three versions. The first was seen in cinemas, and it was way too long, ignored the logic of the story, and simply reminded people that Coppola's was 5 1/2 hrs long and where some of the money had gone.<br/><br/>""Redux"" 2 went to DVD only in 2003, and although it was shorter, it still was illogical. ""Redux"" 3 went to streaming services in 2005 and still wasn't logical.<br/><br/>Point to note: the story came from a book called ""Hearts of Darkness"", and ""Apocalypse"" was officially based on the book. No version of ""Redux"" follows the logic of the book or the 1979 original in which Willard kills Kurtz. If he doesn't, the whole thing becomes meaningless.<br/><br/>That problem - and others - are still in ""Final Cut"". It's shorter, and visually stunning, but it grates when compared to the original.<br/><br/>Back in 1979, I gave the original stars. You can see what I gave ""Final Cut"". The whole saga reminds me of Coppola's recurring of ""The Godfather Part II"", reducing a near-masterpiece into a hideous mess.<br/><br/>Final note: after the one day release of ""Final Cut"" cinemas here were offered a choice: the new version, or the 1979 ""Apocalypse Now"". Guess which one they all chose? The 1979 version is now doing great business here. ""Final Cut"" was only seen on July 25, and with any luck the original will remain with with us when ""Final Cut"" is reduced to a footnote in history. Hopefully ""The Godfather Part II"" can now likewise be restored to that film's 1974 original, and Coppola will leave his four classics from the 1970s alone."

","It might just be because I watched the Redux version, and from what Ive read the some of the stuff that I found to be the most detrimental were some of the parts added, so my opinion could be different based on seeing the original release, but I doubt that.<br/><br/>The issue is that there is a lack of anything to look to over the course of the film. The actual plot line is minimal and the movie just feels like a set of scenes that occur between the first act and the third act when the actual plot takes place. The main character, played by Martin Sheen, isn't very interesting, nor is Marlon Brando's antagonist. There are a number of themes portrayed in the movie, such as the madness of war, but that through line is weak and not enough to carry the second act of the movie on. Instead, it leads to a couple of good scenes here and there, such as the USO Show, but it ultimately doesn't elevate the film's quality.<br/><br/>Other than some colorful side characters like the four members of the boat crew (Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms, Fredric Forrest, and Albert Hall) and Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), the movie is dull and vacant."

","Know outright that this great film has no aspiration toward being a slice of life document of the average U.S. soldier's experience during the Vietnam conflict of the 1960's and 70's. Psychedelic or otherwise, the Vietnam War was simply the most apropos contemporary setting to place this adaptation of Joseph Conrad's mythic novel ""Heart Of Darkness"".<br/><br/>The plot is nothing more (or less) than one man's destiny to confront another man. It's Martin Sheen's Captain Willard floating through surreal chaos in existential angst on a clandestinely assigned mission to find this rogue-warrior-cum-mad-messiah figure of Marlon Brando's Colonial Kurts and either end him or succum to the same madness. In dreamy slow burn we hear the internal dialogue and intimate journal entries of a war wery Willard as he drifts futher down river with his army entourage encountering one bizzare event after another, all the while crystalizing his sole focus on finding the deep jungle compound of this enigmatic Kurts and ultimately eliminating him with ""extreme prejudice"". But will he? Can he? Should he? Why? Who's to say what is even the moral priority anymore in the midst of this grotesque farce of torrential terror and trivial turmoil? The final act and resolution is nothing short of a baroque masterpiece.<br/><br/>The tone is engulfing dread for impending doom. It's this heavy pull-down immersion into the sinking ""heart of darkness"". It's the apocalypse... right now. As Jim Morrison's voice announces over the opening shot of a carpet bombing napalm drop over a palm tree horizon - ""this is the end my beautiful friend"".<br/><br/>Vittorio Storarro's hypnotically tranquil anamorphic cinematography is astonishing in both its lushness and chairoscuro tenebrism. Walter Murch's editing and sound design is fluidly detailed, layered, and mercurial. With the vital contribution of Grateful Dead drummers Mickey Heart and Bill Kreutzmann - father/composer Carmine Coppola, and director Francis himself created an eerie vortex of percussion and abstract sonic experimentation that would become a prototype for the progression of ambient and industrial avante garde music. Francis Ford Coppola mounted a seminally bold vision of Cinema as myth at its highest level of narrative trandscendence. Truly an epic odyssey through the struggling volition of the sentient soul, oneirically seeped in perennial paramnesia. Utterly magnificent and profound.<br/><br/>And the behind the scenes making of the film itself is maybe even more harrowing. Following the experience of this magnas opus, watch the outstanding documentary ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"" as an essential peak into the ground level turbulence and strife that enduringly plagued the legendary production. As documented on location and narrated by director Coppola's stalwart wife Eleanor (with additional subsequent interviewee perspective), the curtain is totally stripped away as each calamity culminates into dangerous flirtation with complete catastrophe. Broadly considered the most transparent and enthralling behind-the-scenes companion piece to a biblically taxing production of a equally worthy Cinematic achievement ever.<br/><br/>Everything around and about ""Apocalypse Now"" is just stunning and rife with wreckage, resilience, and resonance.<br/><br/>I personally prefer the extended ""Redux"" version edit for its ever more sprawling surrealism."

"sandnair87","9","1","3","2 February 2016"," Francis Ford Coppola Lays Bare ""The Horror"" of Combat!
","With a famously horrific shoot, it's now almost unfathomable how Francis Ford Coppola managed to harness the chaotic energy into one of the most potent examinations of war and masculinity to ever grace celluloid in his masterpiece Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>The story, based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, centers on Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), a US Army intelligence officer with a mission to travel into Cambodia and terminate the command of the renegade Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) - a colonel who went crazy and went native, forming his own Montagnard army out in the darkness of the jungle.. Needing to get back in the game, Willard takes the mission and finds himself among a motley crew. Nobody on the boat really understands the mission, least of all Willard himself, who keeps squinting at Kurtz's dossier and marveling at what a model soldier he was. Perhaps Kurtz hasn't gone rogue; perhaps he has simply achieved military apotheosis, carrying out the logical extension of the armed forces. Along the way he bonds with the crew of the boat taking him up-river as they encounter a gung-ho surfing Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), a sexy French woman, a few Playboy Bunnies, a free-wheeling journalist and more war-time horrors than they could have imagined, until he finally meets Colonel Kurtz. This epic dark fantasia ends on a rather elliptical note, which seems the only way for it to end.<br/><br/>'Apocalypse Now' is a confounding mix of the conventional and the surreal, a man-on-a-mission war flick that expands into a meditation. There is greatness to it, but there is also madness, and they feed off each other. From its opening scene of Capt. Willard falling apart in a Saigon hotel, the movie is a nightmare trip into the darkest reaches of the human soul. The depth and audacity of Mr. Coppola's vision makes even the most ambitious of today's films look timid and dreary by comparison. His direction is impeccable, capturing both the intimate detail, overarching spectacle and layered depth of meaning, often all in one shot and thus delivering a harrowing masterwork that bursts with malarial, mystical images. The movie is stunningly beautiful to look at, remarkably moving and horrific, and jammed with memorable characters in unforgettable situations. The score is wondrous, the production design solid and never overdone, and the cinematography is just wow.<br/><br/>On the acting front, Martin Sheen brings astonishing sincerity to Willard and is entirely believable as the cipher, the burned-out husk who's seen too much death to be at peace. Robert Duvall's brilliant turn as Col. Kilgore - a near-cartoonish hawk who lives and breathes war, rings with bracing energy. But the movie ultimately belongs to the maestro himself – Marlon Brando. In a role that has all off 15 minutes of screen time - most of which is spent mumbling in the shadows, delivering hipster rants about atrocities – Brando is extraordinary as the great bald shambling mountain, who both does and doesn't seem to be the monster we've been waiting for.<br/><br/>By any standard, Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece, a towering achievement of sight and sound - an epic freak-out, a fever dream of immense proportions, laying bare the stark horror and unimaginable thrill of combat."

The flaws of this movie lies in its actors. Nearly all of the actors give just an acceptable performance. No performances stand out as impressive. The characters are just plot pieces fulfilling certain tasks to drive the plot. Martin Sheen doesn't communicate the degeneration of his mind, his environment does.

","It took me a bit to nail down the reason for my less-than-fawning reaction to ""Apocalypse Now"" - after all, this movie's so damn revered - but, surprisingly, it's Martin Sheen's voyage up-river (which is really the bulk of the movie). I'm surprised as anyone, seeing as I generally dig his stuff. But his journey into Cambodia just tends to meander through the film. Sure, there are firefights mixed in, but none of this is ever as exciting or mysterious as the film's two most winning features: Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando. And they're only present for such a short time. Duvall is just such a larger than life sociopath; it doesn't hurt that he's at the forefront of the movie's wildest set piece, but he owns the screen. I'm fairly certain the man's ruined ""Ride of the Valkyries"" for me (hijacked, not soured). And Brando looms so large over the entire movie that, you're left wondering what kind of answers are coming when Sheen finally tracks him down. And it's a hallucinatory payoff, to be sure.<br/><br/>6/10"

When the napalm hits that tree-line you know you aren't in for your typical Vietnam war film no, this is something much more, a story of prejudice and curiosity which will take captain Willard (Martin sheen) into a world of despair and one that will question his confidence in normal civilization, and raises the question 'what will he find when he reaches Col. Kurtz' ?<br/><br/>The dialogue in this film is just great, it has one of the most haunting monologues in film history acted perfectly by the legend Marlon Brando. It includes narration by martin sheen that takes us on a journey through the jungle, although we really don't know much about the characters' backgrounds apart form colonel Kurtz, since we hear first hand his dossier throughout the first half of the film. The cinematography is great and will deeply absorb you into the plot, this is particularly evident when we finally see kurtz, we do not see his face much just glimpses and so in the few parts when we clearly see, it is a frightening face.<br/><br/>We get a true portrayal of war here, the grit, the horrors and the damage it caused to not only the Vietnamese people but that damage it caused to the American soldiers. This does not make war look fun, like some other movies nor does it follow the cliché agenda of a hero and a villain, we do not know who the villain is nor who the hero is. <br/><br/>If you go into this expecting just a fast paced war film then do not watch you will be disappointed go watch fury instead, this film will take you on a journey that will be impossible to forget."

","Francis Ford Coppola's ambitious Vietnam War epic based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is my all-time favourite war movie. It can be a bewildering experience perhaps on first viewing, it isn't a perfect movie, less so in the Redux version, but at the end of the day, it is a masterpiece that shines through.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is an immediate attention-grabber, a series of hallucinatory images set to The Doors, and in itself, almost a brief short summary of the film itself, and a hint that we're not about to enter generic war film territory, but something else entirely.<br/><br/>From the start of his journey on a Navy PBR, we see the warzone almost entirely as Captain Willard - Martin Sheen - sees it. And we are treated to an increasingly bizarre series of images, scenes of a land where insanity prevails. A meet-up with the gun-ho Kilgore, a helicopter raid on a village with Ride of the Valkyries playing, a USO show, a base constantly trading fire with the enemy, and the trip into Cambodia, journeying ever further into 'the heart of darkness'. While many had misgivings about the Redux' additions, with another meeting with the Playboy Playmates, and the bizarre encounter with a French plantation, they do add to the sense of madness permeating the land.<br/><br/>Where the film often draws fire is the final act, when Willard meets Marlon Brando's character, Colonel Kurtz. It is true, this sequence is quite slow-going compared to the rest of the film, but it does stay true to the growing sense of senselessness, with Marlon providing the final touches with his rambling speeches, the film slipping further into cerebral territory.<br/><br/>Obviously, this is not a film to watch if you want just explosions and gunfire, though it does provide some of that. This is a magnificent achievement, and deserves all the acclaim bestowed upon it in the years since it's release."

","""Apocalypse Now"" is the end result of literary genius in direct collision with human madness. A film that took more than two years to make that crippled Coppola's confidence as a film maker and rendered many of its stars ill health -- Martin Sheen suffered a near fatal heart attack and Brando was border line mad -- would have to be meritorious to justify its arduous developments. It was. Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now is the story of a spiritually listless Captain Ben Willard (in a brilliantly understated performance by Martin Sheen) who is delegated with the task of executing the rogue colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has defected from the American establishment as the condition of a spiritual and psychological awakening. There have been numerous, and better, studies on the themes and popular significance of Apocalypse Now, so trying to encapsulate the essence of the film in a simple review would be discrediting it to say the least.<br/><br/>Its parallels to Homer's Odyssey are obvious, however while Odysseus' journey was fraught with danger it ultimately concluded on a note of harmony and enlightenment. Apocalypse Now, on the other hand, is a hell without purpose in which there is no coherent notion given to reason and logic. It is one of those incredibly rare films that transcends conventional genre and narrative and becomes an alien like experience that delves as deeply into its geographical heart as it does into the human spirit. The film is essentially composed of three acts: Willard's departure; the trip up river, and the destination. Along the way the viewer witnesses the en masse assault on villagers from a barrage of helicopters to the Wagnerian splendour of Ride of the Valkyries, GI's surf during a hectic conflict, and all of this surreal violence is to contrast the moral absurdity of Willard's mission, which by definition sounds straightforward, however as the film unfolds the mission becomes as questionable as the war itself. There's a double-emphasis with the narration, and it is used as a device to simultaneously guide the audience down the river and illustrate Willard's descent into moral chaos. In the first two acts the narration provides an insight into the mission and his mind, however in the third it becomes disturbed and suddenly Willard ceases to exist as a man and becomes a mere physical extension of the task he was relegated to – a ""Hollow Man"". The irony of this is punctuated between the existential dialogues Willard shares with Kurtz in that there is certain reasoning in the ravings of Kurtz which prompted the Army to surreptitiously assassinate him in the first place. So, Kurtz and Willard are the end result of their superiors. They are two men diametrically opposed, but their fates are cosmically intertwined. Kurtz is the existential Demigod that only could have resulted through war – he is the anti-thesis to the conformist American with conservative values, in fact he is so far removed from the ideal Western citizen that he can only be described as a crude prophet. Indeed his philosophical espousals become truths as he dissects everything from free will to humanitarianism to barbarism. And it is in these dialogues that the film transcends warfare, but aims for the human condition – man's war that is entirely spiritual and deeply personal. Neither man, nor nature, can endure such madness and perhaps it was Coppola's intention to comment on the banality of evil of the Vietnam War by compacting all of its toxic elements within one man's spirit. Apocalypse Now was one of the last of the ""great"" Hollywood productions in which its grandeur was the end result of a film maker's undying love for the medium. Fundamentally on absolutely every conceivable technical and artistic level, Apocalypse Now endures as a timeless masterpiece that reminds viewers that films can be an art form."

","Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"", a loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", is generally considered one of the greatest war films of all time. The movie is based around a mission to track down a renegade officer and terminate his command 'with extreme prejudice'.<br/><br/>The cast is enviable, with Marlon Brando portraying the 'unsound' Colonel Kurtz and Martin Sheen playing the man tasked with bringing him down. Robert Duvall received an Oscar nomination for his spirited portrayal of the eccentric Lieutenant Kilgore. Dennis Hopper also delivered a memorably unhinged performance as a photojournalist who's become a devotee of Kurtz. The rest of the cast is solid but not particularly distinguished.<br/><br/>The story is compelling but those expecting a typical war film may be disappointed. The story has none of the usual 'good guys versus bad guys' Hollywood approach and instead revels in darkness and surrealism. The film is, first and foremost, a journey. I'm not totally satisfied with the ending but I respect that the film makes its points with subtlety and verve.<br/><br/>Coppola's direction is flawless and the Academy Award-winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is breathtaking. The film also won an Oscar for its sound, which is excellent. The soundtrack is also notable due to the deft use of the Doors' song ""The End"". The synthesizer score doesn't really suit my tastes but, even so, I can't deny that parts of it are highly atmospheric.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a unquestionably a must-see film. It's not quite perfect but it showcases great artistry in terms of both story and presentation. By the way, I consider the 2001 'Redux' version to be inferior to the original version."
"cshep","10","1","3","25 May 2008"," Classic ! Testimony to the Insanity of War ! Not the Redux version !
","For everyone who knows of War, but has never felt or tasted its affects, then this film is REQUIRED viewing ! <br/><br/>From the Heart of Darkness comes ""Apocalypse Now!"" A truly visionary film , about the realities, and insanities that take place , inside the Red Zone of war.<br/><br/>The time is mid to late 1960's and the War in Vietnam is near its height of escalation, Capt. Willard is assigned to go to Cambodia, and assassinate Gen/Col. Walt Kurtz(Marlon Brando), a combat veteran who has become an embarrassment to the U.S., because he has gone insane, and is conducting his OWN war. <br/><br/>When Joseph Conrad wrote his book, it was originally to take place in the Congo of Africa, under different circumstances. Coppala reassigns the action to Southeast Asia, under dubious circumstances, and uses the Vietnam War as the backdrop for this insane asylum.<br/><br/>Capt. Benjamin Willard(Martin Sheen) is brilliant as the subdued young soldier, struggling with his own demons, as he tries to justify his mission of assassination.<br/><br/>Each sequence has its own reality, and the deeper they go up the river, the farther they remove themselves from civilized thinking , and the gray area between right and wrong, and moral justification, wow !<br/><br/>Truly amazing, each character has their own way of dealing with the daily horrors they face, and the viewer is drawn in with them, what a film ! From Col. Kilgore to Col. Kurtz, they all show the affects of the horrors of war, whether they recognize it , or not !<br/><br/>Beautifully framed and photographed, Coppala connects on a deep and personal level, about the value of life, and man's mortality.<br/><br/>This is one of the most visceral and moving films, not for the squeamish. I do not recommend the Redux version, it is not the same film. It does not remove you from civilized society like the original release, this is one time a director should not have final cut.<br/><br/>Dark and moody, you get a real feel for the soldiers and their families , that fought in Vietnam. The feeling of isolation and hopelessness, and abandonment !<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper is the reporter who embraces the view of Kurtz, and is terrific. Required viewing , for everyone on how not to fight a war, our enemies ARE watching. <br/><br/>Watch the Original release before viewing the bastardized version Redux, you won't be disappointed.I gave the original a 10, !<br/><br/>No faults, it does have 4 endings, but I have as yet to know of their release."
"johno-21","10","1","3","28 February 2006"," One of the best films ever made
","This is one of the finest films ever made. Francis Ford Coppala took a huge budget, a huge cast, made a location film outside of the US and took a controversial topic, being the Vietnam War and managed to put all this together and emerge with war film unlike any other. Martin Sheen as the principal character on his mission to his confrontation with the renegade colonel is outstanding. Marlon Brando as that colonel dug deep into somewhere to come across with his memorable performance. Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forest are among the excellent cast. This film has great acting, great character development, a great screenplay, fantastic sound, incredible editing, outstanding cinematography and it's art direction and photography are superb. Just so many elements that go into making a great movie so successfully accomplished here that it's hard to appreciate a single technical element with so much going on and cohesively coming together. The inventive storyline was such a departure to everything that had been shown on TV and in the papers and magazines about coverage of the Vietnam War and it's depiction and reference in other films. The trip up the river begins like a Tarzan movie and evolves into Road Warrior movie and to a Star Trek mission to a western to a psychedelic freak show with a war going on all around it. I've seen this many times but remember when I saw this in the theater when it first came out and people instead of talking among themselves about as they left the theater were just going Wow! This film had eight Academy Award nominations, all deservedly so, but only won two for Sound and Cinematography. I would give this a 10 on a scale of 10 and highly recommend it."

"theb_ronster","10","1","3","17 April 2005"," The horror...the horror...the brilliance.
","Apocalypse Now is among the most brilliant and powerful films of all time, if not THE. It undoubtedly has the best cinematography, and it is home to many of the most famous, brilliant lines in film history. It is a true shame that not only did this film not take home the Academy Award for Best Picture, but it has come to be a come when one can open up the TV Guide to see the title listed in the movies section with only three stars beside it. Martin Sheen jump-started his career with this epic masterpiece, and he was astounding. This film does not fit into any one genre. Many people consider it to be a war movie, but I strongly disagree. This film is a deep, moving drama, which could have been set at any time in any place, without changing the plot. Like many other great movies (The English Patient, Cold Mountain), war is an effective back-story, and it is used surprisingly well (I am not a fan of war movies at all). The most masterful thing about this film was the brilliantly effective choice of playing 'The End', by The Doors to open and close the film. I think that the opening and closing scenes are among the most memorable scenes in cinematic history. The entire cast is excellent, the direction is indescribable, and the cinematography is destined to blow all of its audiences away. This movie put the epic in masterpiece. The thrilling conclusion, where Willard (Martin Sheen) assassinates Kurtz (Marlon Brando) can be interpreted in many, many different ways, to the extent that one could stay up all night debating with his friends over the topic and not reach a conclusion come morning. This is, undoubtedly, a classic."
"Jude_E_Fitzgerald","10","1","3","28 March 2005"," I enjoy this movie every time I see it.
","The film ""Apocalypse Now"" is quite possibly the greatest war movie of all time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and starring Martin Sheen, as well as the magnificent Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now is the epitome of what a movie should be. Coppola sets out to show what war does to minds, to nations. He succeeds beyond the scope of what anyone could expect. You are immersed in the story, the characters' problems become your own, and by the end of the movie, you may never look at the world the same way again. This movie is tantamount to scarring in regard to how well it imparted its message. ""Apocalypse Now"" is the story of a psychotic quest by Sgt. Willard (martin sheen) to find and kill the renegade Col. Kurtz. (Marlon Brando). You follow his footsteps, as he immerses himself more and more in the hunt for Kurtz. At each obstacle you see more and more how disenfranchised Willard is becoming with the war. Finally, near the end of the movie, you what happens when Willard finally does find Kurtz. This is not really a movie about war; it's a movie about people. It subtly portrays how people act in a hellish situation, how their environment forces them to adapt, or sends them spiraling into insanity. One example of this is a scene where Willard makes a stop at the Do-lung bridge. The bridge is under attack, but no one can tell where the attack is coming from, and no one on the American side know who's in charge. This is representative of the war as a whole, because it occurs toward the end of the movie. In the beginning, The American presence was efficient, clean-cut, organized. By this point, the last American outpost on the Nung river, The Americans are shell-shocked and almost crazy. This shows quite effectively the course of the entire war. <br/><br/>The film looks wonderful. The composition of nearly every shot is perfect. The colors are vivid, and the scenery is captivating, adding vastly to the realism of the movie. As a director, Coppola puts the camera exactly where it needs to be. Coppola also makes heavy use of the fade, to go from one angle to the next, adding a sense of ""smoothness"" to the entire movie. This fade technique is critical to much of the character development of Willard, the main character. In the beginning of the movie, Coppola uses a montage, laden with faded layers of other shots, to convey the fragile state of Willard's mind. <br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes is the aerial attack on a NVA controlled village. Coppola makes astounding use of high/low camera angles, using them to bring to mind images of a traditional equine cavalry charge, even though they were helicopters rather than horses. This effect is enhanced by the music in the scene, Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. Coppola also uses the low camera angle to show the invincibility of the rather strange cavalry commander, while he reminisces about previous battles and proclaims his affinity for ""the smell of napalm in the morning"".<br/><br/>A rather interesting camera technique was used in one scene of the movie that caught my attention. As Willard was being pulled to the ground by a group of religious fanatics, he was tuned upside down, then dropped in the mud as he struggled. During all of this, the camera was rotating on the z-axis, producing a spinning picture, which sometimes had Willard as right side up and the rest of the world upside down, and for the rest of the time had it reversed. <br/><br/>Because of the stunning environment, the brilliant direction, and ultimately, how well the story was told, this movie is one of my favorite movies."
"tfrizzell","Null","1","3","23 July 2000"," My Oh My
","How can one describe ""Apocalypse Now""?  Well, it is certainly ambitious, perverted, wild, chaotic, insane, and overall exceptional.  The film deals with a war-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who is assigned to kill a Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a once great military man who has gone crazy and created his own civilization deep in the jungles of Vietnam.  While traveling upstream to meet Brando, Sheen reflects on his experiences and the film becomes stranger and more hypnotic.  He meets an equally crazy officer who ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning"" played by Oscar-nominated Robert Duvall.  Duvall leads helicopter corps to overhead assaults of Vietnamese villages, destroying everything in sight.  More situations follow and the film twists and turns into more chaos.  Coppola's film was a near disaster that somehow succeeds through it all.  The screenplay is strange to say the least (I think that was the plan all along), but everything else is right on target.  This is one of the greatest war (or anti-war films) ever made.  ""Apocalypse Now"" is also the last great film made in the 1970s.  The performances by Sheen and Duvall are excellent.  Brando just makes a token appearance during the film's finale and he is hardly seen because the cinematography is so dark near the end.  Also look for a young Laurence Fishburne and a crazed photographer played by Dennis Hopper.  Try to spot Harrison Ford in a cameo near the very start.  An excellent achievement, worthy of 5 stars out of 5."

","Every once in a while, some war movie is released and some brain-dead film critic said things like ""The best war movie ever""  I'm so sick of it.  I mean, that statement had been applied to countless war movies already. Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, etc, are all garbage.<br/><br/>After hearing so many good words about Apocalypse Now, I just had to go and watch it on video.  My conclusion after watching it?  It's an okay film with an amazing cinematography, but is way too overhyped.  Besides, I already watched a better film that also depicts a man's journey towards madness. Werner Herzog's film called 'Aguirre: The Wrath Of God' is a flat-out masterpiece.<br/><br/>First of all, no Vietnam war movies ever depict the other side of the story. I mean, directors always make them as though the US had won or something. Nobody dared to make a movie about the enduring humiliation that the US suffered due to the stupidity of global war against communism.  For example, movies like 'Dogma' is clever and challenging because Kevin Smith dares to poke fun out of Catholicism.  But I guess it's easier to cover up and bask in denial in a form of a hot-shot Hollywood director's chair.<br/><br/>The greatest war movie ever?  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  No comparison."

","Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 Apocalypse Now, is a Vietnam war story that is focused around an Army Captains trip up a river to assassinate a rogue Colonel. Martin Sheen is Captain Benjamin L. Willard who has been tasked with the assassination of former Green Beret Colonel Walter E. Kurtz played by Marlon Brando. Captain Benjamin L. Willard is escorted up the Nung River by Chief Phillips (Albert Hall) and his Navy patrol boat crew to carry out his classified mission.
This film has a very strong upside from the point of directing, editing and producing. Francis Ford Coppola maximized the effectiveness of lighting, colors, and angles to produce a cinematic masterpiece. The natural light and darkness often add to the effectiveness of the characters while providing a connective touch to the viewer. Francis Ford Coppola's introduction is unusual and quickly grabs the viewers' attention. The open starts without introduction or credits. Instead, the slow-motion action of helicopters and napalm bomb fires in a jungle setting is set in rhythm with music of the The Doors. The scene begins to fade-out/fade-in with Captain Willard in a room. A ceiling fan and the blades of the helicopter are used to create a smooth transition. Similar techniques and the same music are used to close the movie as Captain Willard slays Colonel Kurtz in the same fashion as a cow is simultaneously being slaughtered nearby. 
Though I believe this movie is worth watching, it does have its downside. The movie is very cryptic throughout and can be very slow at times. It is not a Vietnam war movie along the line of Full Metal Jacket or Platoon, instead, this movie is more artistic and may keep the viewer searching for a deeper meaning."

","I love reviewing older, classic films. When I watch a really great movie that was made in the 70's or some bygone decade, I get that tingle in my cinephilic being that I just gotta discuss it or bring it up to a friend of mine who may have never even heard of the movie! APOCALYPSE NOW, is a film like THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA or LAWRENCE OF ARABIA; it's highly acclaimed by nearly every movie lover out there. So it'd be blasphemous for me NOT to talk about this movie and perhaps even introduce the movie to younger cinephiles that haven't seen anything beyond what's been released during their recent lifetime. So is APOCALYPSE NOW, really a great piece of art or a long, boring war movie?<br/><br/>MARTIN SHEEN is Special Operations Vet., Captain Ben Willard, a troubled American soldier who is called back to duty during the Vietnam War. His mission is to track down and kill a renegade, Col. Walter E. Kurtz (the great MARLON BRANDO), who has made himself something of a god deep, in the jungles of Cambodia and now controls a small army of natives that obey his every attack and command. To get there, Captain Willard, travels by riverboat up the Nung River which is crawling with Viet Cong and we, as an audience, take this journey with him and meet a plethora of characters that include an extremely young LAURENCE FISHBURNE, ROBERT DUVALL as the darkly comical Kilgore, and DENNIS HOPPER as a tripped out photo journalist who has just been in a war torn jungle too long.<br/><br/>For my full, in depth review of APOCALYPSE NOW, please head over to my Tumblr.

"phd_travel","7","1","4","15 January 2015"," A brave fantasy but not the greatest Vietnam war movie for sure
","If you want a good movie about the Vietnam War watch Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth for the effect on the Vietnamese, watch Casualties of War for war crimes on the Vietnamese, or Platoon, Full Metal Jacket or Deer Hunter for the effect on the soldiers. For the impact of the War on the Cambodians, watch The Killing Fields. Apocalypse now is not mainly about the Vietnamese or Cambodians even though it is set there. It is a fictional dark fantasy allegorical tale inspired by Conrad about the ugliness of the Vietnam war and what it did to the soldiers fighting it. It's brave for the time, but it's by no means the greatest of the Vietnam War movies because it is so unreal.<br/><br/>In 1979 when this was released, the Vietnam war hadn't been over that long. This movie was an anti war statement showing the effect of the war on soldiers. Contrasting the ugly behavior of the soldiers fire bombing peaceful villages to Wagner and killing civilian fishermen and women. The ugly Playboy entertainment that gets out of hand shows the soldiers at their most base and primal. Finally holed up in a Cambodian temple they resort to some pagan mass murdering decapitating barbaric tribal society. Martin Sheen is good. Look out for young Lawrence Fishburne and Harrison Ford. But Marlon Brando is too overweight to have been a military man.<br/><br/>Brave, unreal and not the greatest."

","After years of hearing how great this movie is, all I can say is that i am beyond disappointed. Initially it seemed like I was going to love the film. Everything just looked and sounded perfect. Then, the film seemed to get lost within itself. In fact, there's a specific point in the movie where you can see it start to fall apart and then just get worse and worse.<br/><br/>Everything up to and including the scenes with Robert Duvall was interesting and almost gripping, then the movie just starts to slowly descend into pointless garbage. How the hell the movie gets as lost as it does I have no idea. It should have worked, everything was there to make it work...everything except the vision to keep it together I guess. Much of this movie leaves you feeling like your stuck in a bad trip or like your high and spacing out.<br/><br/>Maybe you need to be high to make sense of this film but all I can say is that there are much better films about the Vietnam era than this one. Would I recommend this movie? No. Not at all. Watch Deer Hunter (1978) or Platoon (1986). Both are far better films with solid story lines that rip you apart the way a movie like this should. Apocalypse now is just a mess that's not at all worth wasting your time on. If I have anything good to say about this movie it's that at least the acting is solid, the directing is good and the cinematography is excellent. <br/><br/>The problem is the story is a lost cause and the ending anti-climactic. Much of the movie is just a confused distorted mess full of scenes that serve no purpose and manage to go nowhere. To be honest, about half the film could have been left on the cutting room floor and the movie would have been better as a result. What else can I say except to end where I started. I am so incredibly disappointed with this movie."

Maybe - almost certainly - it was more powerful when it was made in 1979 but I didn't feel it had anything new to say for today.<br/><br/>Yes - the cinematography was great and the battle scenes were incredibly realistic for that time but that is not what makes a good film. The story line was pretty non-existent; the message (war is futile and dehumanising??) has been made many times before (and since) and I felt no empathy with any of the characters (with the exception, strangely, of the pilot of the boat). I really didn't care whether the Duvall character lived or died! The scene towards the end interspersing the sacrificial killing of a bullock(?) with the killing of the mad Kurtz was embarrassingly trite and the film in general - dragged....!

","Apocalypse Now started off with a confusion which made it hard to become interested, but the use of loud noises and action did manage to keep me somewhat involved. However, I was impressed with the film work and effects due to the time period, but it was still hard to pay attention. As the movie went on it continued getting strange which made it difficult to pay attention; the movie lacked interest and depth so did not see the point to try to understand what was going on when I was not the least bit interested, if anything I did not like it one bit. Besides the strange plot and actions the message in the movie itself is disappointing. It puts down the war veterans of the Vietnam War making it seem as if they were more interested doing drugs and being crazy that fighting for their country. This movie may have had a slightly intriguing plot, but it was nothing special. I was in no way impressed by this film and I would not recommend it on any circumstances."

I feel as though it just got crazier and crazier toward the end and went on this weird path that totally left the whole first hour and a half of the movie. I didn't like how it dragged you through all kinds of crap just to leave you hanging with all kinds of questions unanswered. I won't even get started about the stupid buffalo or the dog.

"diamondsparkle-657-746756","5","1","4","20 June 2010"," Well Begun and Left Half Done
","The movie opens with some painful scenes. An army captain laments about how his life is not what he wanted it to be. He sits there in his room naked, drinks, smokes, cuts himself, has almost lost his mind, and doesn't quite know what to do next. Tragedy in uniform never was this well captured.<br/><br/>As for the movie, tragedy in film-making was never this well accomplished. While the first half battles beautifully and successfully for your attention, the second half makes its duty to make you run away. This I hardly expected from Francis Ford Coppola.<br/><br/>With a running time of 202 minutes, Apocalypse Now: Redux is all about the Vietnam war and the wretched cruel havoc that sliced through every American soldier who happened to be part of the operation. While it details the slow but sure degradation of the senses of these soldiers, it weaves together the tale of a Special Forces guy tasked with a mission to assassinate another Special Forces guy who -fed up with all the bloodshed-has turned insane and wages a war of his own deep in the jungles of Cambodia.<br/><br/>I have no complaints about the first half. It's splendid and no matter how many superlatives you use, you just cannot do justice to its description. The visuals are stunning. There's never a moment the cameraman lost his control on his art. The battle scenes are dipped in sunsets reeking of gold that swerve all over the screen and make it a delight to watch. The beauty of the shores and backwaters of the Philippines is passed off as Vietnam and the action scenes swirl in majestic hues of green and ocean blue. The battle scenes themselves are black comedy personified: The commanding officer (Robert Duvall) bothers more about his surfing than the danger his men face. And he decides to play Wagner in the midst of the noise that missiles and machine guns orchestrate.<br/><br/>Coppola scripts and captures a truly fearful ambiance as the search unit makes it way down or up the river and the thrills are thrown in with just the right pace. But once the thrills are done with and the monologue starts off, inevitably, the film drags itself to the bottom of the river and mumbles to itself.<br/><br/>This is the veritable second half in which begins the deterioration.<br/><br/>The whole enterprise thereafter seems to have been shot on whims and fancies that ultimately decided to head nowhere. Even as the search party does reach its destination, you can sense the director doesn't quite know how to tie up his portmanteau and say goodbye.<br/><br/>So he dilly dallies. He throws in decapitated bodies, severed heads, mumbo-jumbo about the Vietnam war - all passed off as excuses why the rogue became a rogue after all. There was no need for an explanation, really. The agonies the army went through were established earlier on in the movie. So Marlon Brando repeating it all while the cameraman adds touches of arty cinema is quite irritating to watch.<br/><br/>I think Coppola got carried away - and it's easy for the artistic to fall for that - and ultimately was so in love with whatever he shot, he did not want to do away with anything. Either that or he shot the movie when he was high. In fact, I think Brando was on weed himself.<br/><br/>He's horrible as the alleged insane rogue. Apparently, he had put on weight and so, he's forever in the shadows. So you see none of the physical enigma that he is famous for. Worse is the fact that he doesn't look mean and doesn't even scare you - his love for decapitated bodies and severed heads notwithstanding. Brando is deadpan - almost like wood.<br/><br/>The aura that Coppola draws around Brando's character giggles and vanishes in thin air as Brando himself makes it to the screen. There's no command, no hint of power, scarcely a mean look, and he looks quite uninterested in making an effort to do his job. Let's say he chose to be a lump of meat embroidered with acres of fat and thought his name will shoot down all criticism of his act.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is wasted in a two-minute role that could have been easily edited out. Why he allowed himself into this venture I have no clue. Perhaps the star cast attracted him into the venture, or maybe it was the money. Whatever it was, the role he landed needed skills that could have come with any Dick, Tom, or Harrylina!<br/><br/>A young Laurence Fishburne makes quite an impression as a 17-year old sailor and Martin Sheen's expressions make you feel the angst and depression his character toys with every second of the movie.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is in synch with the scenes and The Doors have been used extensively in the finale. However, the end comes as if it's served as a complimentary side dish to placate your annoyance with the entire course. And so you end up appreciating neither the music nor the scenes woven around it for you just want to finish your meal before you fall asleep. <br/><br/>All said and done, the movie brings out the tragedy of Vietnam with a flair necessary for such a saga. All the frustration is well filmed and the idiocy of the generals in charge makes for some nice black comedy. If only Coppola had to stick to subtlety as he did in the first half and not let himself get dragged into a rather Bollywoodish explosion of drama, Apocalypse now: Redux would not have limped in dreadful slow motion to the finishing line."

","""Apocalypse Now"" is almost impossible to give a numerical grade to. The reason why is simple, while the first part is very good, the film simply falls to pieces once Marlon Brando appears. Full of unforgettable scenes and images the first part might qualify as great cinema except for the need for a narration to make sense of the material - a sure sign of the mess the script was in as shooting began. Brando in the end manages to destroy everything with a mumbling, mannered wreck of a performance. If Brando had given Coppola one of his great latter turns in ""The Godfather"", here he gives the worst performance by a name actor I have ever seen. It stinks and anybody who tries to persuade you otherwise is deluded. Apparently Coppola was influenced by Herzog's ""Aguirre"", and certainly both movies are a mixture of the great and the awful, what lifts Herzog's film though is Klaus Kinski's performance. In my dreams I have an ""Apocalypse Now"" with Kinski in the Brando role -it's a much better film even though I'll never see it. The ""Redux"" version adds running time but detracts from the film by much more and should be avoided."
"wmarkley","6","1","4","15 November 2006"," A Few Great Moments but Many Poor Ones
","""Apocalypse Now"" shows some greatness here and there, but its also one of the most over-rated movies. Its a very good illustration of why egotistical directors often need someone to make big cuts in their work due to self-indulgence. Here and there, much of ""AN"" stretches on seemingly endlessly, with very little compensation in imagery, especially in the longer version. Some of the images and other elements might satisfy those with a taste for the surreal, but that's not a lot to say for such a long movie. And often ""surreal"" is just a fancy name for pretentiousness.<br/><br/>The whole French episode is silly, and seems pretty pointless except to show that the French once had a presence in Vietnam, and to exhibit the physical attributes of one French actress. Much of the dialog in this segment is unintentionally comical too, including at a funeral. The French episode along with an extended stay with some stranded Playboy bunnies badly break up the continuity of the plot, with very long interludes in which nothing much happens except for some sophomoric humor in the case of the bunnies. On the other hand, an advantage of the longer movie version over the one initially released in theaters is that it includes a few brief clips early on which reveal a bit more about the major characters on the boat.<br/><br/>I'm unimpressed by the characterizations throughout the movie. The characters mostly seem as if they were pulled from a comic book. For those who remember the old Sergeant Rock comic books, AN is sort of like a spacy, cynical, hip version of them. And its fashionable nowadays to criticize earlier war movies for their inclusion of soldiers from all walks of life: the poor kid, the farm boy, the immigrant, the rich kid, etc. AN, for all its pseudo-sophistication, does a 1970's version of this, particularly with the boat crew.<br/><br/>For me, Dennis Hopper and Robert Duvall are by far the best elements of the movie. Hopper as a wacked-out, guru-following photographer is very much like a few 1960's relics whom I've known, and he nicely captures their wackiness, obsessions and paranoia. Robert Duvall is also good as the cocky, driven, combative officer who shows flashes of compassion. He and Hopper were much more memorable than the main characters in the boat, except maybe for the Fishburne character nicknamed ""Clean."" Brando shows off his weirdness, which is somewhat appropriate for the role of Kurtz. For my taste, it would have been more satisfying to see Kurtz more, but the filmmakers probably wanted to keep some mysteriousness about him, which is legitimate.<br/><br/>Don't watch AN thinking that this is a ""Vietnam movie."" Please people, remember that you won't get history from movies like this! Sure, AN shows some of the absurdity and horror of that war, but there is absurdity and horror in every war, and in many other major human undertakings. AN does touch upon a few aspects of Vietnam such as the jungle settings, draftees, poor morale in some sectors, and no front lines, but it seems to fit more into some sort of adventure/mythology/noir genre than a realistic depiction of war.<br/><br/>On the plus side, AN serves at times as a pretty good adventure story, or it would if it was drastically cut. Much of the credit for its good story elements and major themes should go to Joseph Conrad, who wrote Heart of Darkness upon which AN is very loosely based. The combat scenes with the Air Cavalry are also pretty well done, and some of the imagery is nice and imaginative, such as the boat floating underneath a wrecked plane. Overall, though, the sophomoric humor and pretentiousness which saturate this movie are big flaws."

","This is hands down the best War film ever made, and in my opinion Coppola's best work(yes even better then the Godfather). It has 2 of the best performances ever in a movie in my opinion by Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando, plus, it's very engrossing throughout. If your looking for a war movie with lots of war, look elsewhere, however if your looking for a powerful, amazingly acted, and intense war film, look no further. The character development, is absolutely fantastic, and you really start to root and feel for Sheen's character, plus when Marlon Brando finally does show up, it's one of the creepiest things you will ever see.It's a film with a powerful message and if you haven not seen it yet, you must right now, get it now. The Direction is absolutely amazing. Francis Ford Coppola does an amazing job here, with realistic war scenes, creating lots of tension, great use of shadows for Brando, awesome zoom in's, and some amazing camera work,it's one of the best directing jobs i have ever seen, i won't spoil the rest for you. there is lots of harsh violence. We get a hand cut graphically on glass,lots of bloody corpses,guy holding his guts in,lots of bloody gunshot wounds,gory impaling with an arrow,gory surgery on a guy with no leg,severed heads,slicing and dicing,and a live cow is chopped to pieces. The Acting is absolutely incredible and no doubt Oscar worthy. Martin Sheen is incredibly amazing here, and gives one of the best performances i have ever seen, he is extremely likable, vulnerable, was intense and it really looked like that some of his emotion was on screen , he was really into his role, (Martin Rules!). Marlon Brando is amazing, here, he didn't have much screen time but he was on you knew it, he gives one of the creepiest performances i have ever seen, always lurking in the shadows, his creepy voice just a wonderful, wonderful performance. Frederic Forrest is very good with what he has to do here, and was likable. Sam Bottoms is okay here and nothing more. Albert Hall is good but wish he didn't go so soon. Robert Duvall is excellent in his scenes, and seemed to be having a blast. Laurence Fishburne is excellent as usual , but looked very very young. Dennis Hopper is an awesome actor but annoyed the crap out of me here.Harrison Ford shines in his scene, wish he had a lot more screen time though. Overall this is hands down the best war film ever made and if you have not seen it yet, see it right this instant it's one of the greatest films ever made, and it's Coppola's best work! ***** out of 5"
"movieguy1021","8","1","4","11 December 2004"," Apocalypse Now: 8/10
","I think filmmakers need to know that the Vietnam War is over and done with. Although most were made in the 70s and 80s, there's been way too many Vietnam War movies. What's worse is that almost all, if not all of them, are great movies. And what's worst of all is that almost all of them are forgettable. No one can deny the power that Platoon had, but can you really remember much about it six months after seeing it? One month? That's the trouble with war movies in general. It's been about a month since I've seen Apocalypse Now (I've been busy), and I don't remember much about it. Even while watching the movie, I thought to myself, ""Man, this movie is amazing, but it won't have any lasting effect."" That's exactly the case.<br/><br/>Col. Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent by the military to eliminate Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) ""with extreme prejudice"". Supposedly Kurtz set himself up as a god among men in Cambodia, and Willard and Co. have to go and destroy him and his compound. Along the way comes Robert Duvall and a horde of random soldiers-the token black man (Laurence Fishburn) who has an odd nickname, the fish-out-of-water (Sam Bottoms), and more.<br/><br/>Sure, Apocalypse Now is long (two and a half hours), and at times it drags-especially when it comes to Duvall's random character. Perhaps I just don't remember it that well (see my first paragraph), but he just popped up. However, Francis Ford Coppola's movie does create a feeling of isolation and desperation. That's what all war movies are supposed to do, but Apocalypse Now does it better than others. In fact, the effect that the movie had on me while watching was tremendous-easily as heart-pounding as the first part of Full Metal Jacket, and was mixed with the sadness of inevitably knowing that I wouldn't remember this. But the acting's good (but Marlon Brando, man-he must've been in for about ten minutes), and as you're watching it, you'll love it. If you remember it afterward, you'll continue to love it.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for disturbing violent images, language, sexual content and some drug use."

","The film (redux) is three hours and a 15 minutes long and that's just too long for this story. The director has gone crazy in this film with cloud curtains in all kinds of colour. The film loses its pace after the scene with the surfers. And why is Marlyn Brando so important you only see him at the end of the movie. The message of the picture is that war is crazy but that doesn't mean you have to make some surrealistic movie that isn't funny, shocking or moving. That river goes on and on.

It was all too clear to me that this was A Movie Set, not reality, and people only did things because Mr. Coppola's script said they did.  Seeing ""Heart of Darkness,"" the movie about the making of Apocalypse Now, was probably a bad idea too.  Instead of American helicopters attacking Vietnam, I saw choppers borrowed from the Filipino army flying through synchronized special effects. Kinda took the fun out of things. I dunno.  It's heralded as one of the greatest war movies ever, but I found it just too fictional to be believable (even though it IS beautifully shot)."
"jgcorrea","5","1","5","20 August 2018"," Often auteurs are hollow just like inspiration is fake
","Joseph Conrad's 1899 novella Heart of Darkness was about venturing into the moral depths of colonial Africa. Though it wasn't an immediate sensation, it evidently was not ignored by the literary community. The famous line announcing the antagonist's demise, ""Mistah Kurtz-he dead,"" served as an epigraph to T.S. Eliot's poem ""The Hollow Men.""
Eighty years after Conrad's book debuted, the Coppola film Apocalypse Now hit the big screen. Though lightly influenced by Heart of Darkness, the movie's setting was not the Belgian Congo, but the Vietnam War. And though the antagonist (played by Marlon Brando) was named Kurtz, that particular Kurtz was no ivory trader, but a U.S. military officer who had become mentally unhinged. 
The book began and ended in the United Kingdom. Though it recounted Marlow's voyage through Belgian Congo in search of Kurtz and is forever linked to the African continent, Conrad's novella began and ended in England. At the story's conclusion, the ""tranquil waterway"" that ""seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness"" was none other than the River Thames.
The well-traveled protagonist, Marlow-who appears in other Conrad works, such as Lord Jim-was based on his equally well-traveled creator. In 1890, 32-year-old Conrad sailed the Congo River while serving as second-in-command on a Belgian trading company steamboat. As a career seaman, Conrad explored not only the African continent but also ventured to places ranging from Australia to India to South America.
Colonizing was then, when the book appeared,all the rage . Imperialism-now viewed as misguided, oppressive, and ruthless-was much in vogue when Conrad hit shelves. The ""Scramble for Africa"" had seen European powers stake their claims on the majority of the continent. Britain's Queen Victoria was portrayed as the colonies' ""great white mother."" Since the wise magi saw the star in the East, Christianity had found no nobler expression. Conrad, however, did not echo the imperialistic exuberance. He no champion of colonialism, 
Chinua Achebe-the Nigerian author -delivered a 1975 lecture called ""An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness"" that described Conrad as a ""thoroughgoing racist"" and his ubiquitous classic novella as ""an offensive and deplorable book."" However, even Achebe credited Conrad for having ""condemned the evil of imperial exploitation."" And others have recognized Heart of Darkness as an indictment of the unfairness and barbarity of the colonial system.
Heart of Darkness managed to ascend to immense prominence in the 1950s, after the planet had witnessed ""the horror""-Kurtz's last words in the book-of WWII and the ramifications of influential men who so thoroughly indulged their basest instincts.
Coppola's film was based on a terrible misreading of Conrad. Coppola turned a brilliant piece of fiction into a visual disaster. The complex narrative was transformed in ordinary Kitsch. The final scenes, involving Dennis Hopper and Marlon Brando , are lame. 
What, then, can one see in ""Apocalypse Now""? 
Little more than all the one-sided anti-American, anti-Vietnam-war stereotypes of those times: Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries subtly suggesting that America might be a counterpart to National Socialism); the denunciation of the ""Ugly American"" alienation; the irony & smartness of metaphors like juxtaposing warfare and surfer-safaris ; and so on. Hardly ""the most honest account of the futility of war."" A better description is ""a schizophrenic approach to the randomness of guerrilla warfare."" An ambiguous fantasy. But people are welcome to read into it any way they want."
"KineticSeoul","10","1","5","7 January 2017"," Imaginative and deep look into the Vietnam war and the indoctrination of evil.
","This is a very interesting, dark and somewhat surreal look into the Vietnam war. It's a intense and deep movie with a lot of imagery that shows the evil side of men. This was a very very difficult movie to produce and direct because of many different set backs, budget constraints and conditions. Marlon Brando's condition was one of them, because he was a difficult actor to work with. Despite his excellent portrayal of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. The plot is about Captain Benjamin L. Willard(Martin Sheen) who has his share of seeing the dark side of humanity, horror and evil getting sent off on a mission to find and track down and eliminate Kurtz for unspecified reasons. For Willard, Kurtz is someone that he secretly has somewhat of a respect for and to a certain extent understand where Kurtz is coming from. In another words Kurtz is someone that resonated with Willard. It's actually very clear where Hideo Kojima got some of his ideas for the first ""Metal Gear"" video games. When it comes to a soldier who is facing his own demons and longing for war trying to track down and eliminate a legendary soldier. When it comes to this films portrayal and mentality of most soldiers during the Vietnam war, it is shown for what it was instead of glorifying it. It delves into the inner persona of the soldiers during the Vietnam war and how to some of them it was just a big game. Maybe to show how seeing so much death and carnage can numb the human conscienceness. As a matter of fact the more Willard and his group delve into the jungle the more he experiences dehumanization. And how some people may play nice to hide the evil within their hearts. This is a very ambitious, ambiguous and masterful film that really immerses the audiences into the indoctrination of evil on screen because of war.<br/><br/>10/10"
"robert-259-28954","9","1","5","16 October 2016"," A landmark work of filmmaking.
","This iconic motion picture can be summed up in a single phrase: A descent into Hell. In essence, the sum total of the Vietnam War. It begins as a relatively bland exploration of life in the military in those days, more specifically in the life of a single soldier, given the distasteful task of the elimination of a rogue officer. Then it immediately, inexorably morphs into an abundant panorama of the horrors that characterized the horrors of that tragic and unnecessary conflict. The director, a superb Francis Ford Coppola, wisely relies on intense visual imagery to tell the story, instead of using the heavy-handed moralizing or storytelling so liberally used in most depictions of war, allowing the ever changing landscape to reveal this soldier's tale of both inner confusion and his unflinching, rigid implementation of military code. In his incredible use of the filmmaker's art, Coppola gradually develops a sense of fear and dread unseen in previous war films, epitomized by the final appearance of an incredible Marlon Brando in one of the most memorable and controversial roles of his career."

Marlon Brando was really disappointing. Otherwise this movie is a 10/10 one.<br/><br/>Finally Sheen Shines and Brando Doomed.<br/><br/>Since I don't like animal cruelty, it took me a lot of time to decide whether to watch it or not.

","Wow. I just don't even know where to begin. Have you ever had one of those dreams where you are attacked by a grizzly bear while on an African safari so you swim to the surface and turn into a pterodactyl in order to fly away to safety? Yeah, Apocalypse Now is a little bit like that. It starts off as a Vietnam War movie, and looks great all the way to the end, but the story – the story – it is insane! The film would have been more aptly titled, ""Captain Benjamin Willard's Expedition to the Temple of Nonsense"".<br/><br/>The further up the river they get, the more drugged out the movie starts to feel, which at first I thought was going to be a reference to post-traumatic stressnope, just good old fashion lunacy. It starts with the impossible behavior of Lt. Col. Kilgore, but I just wrote that off as a strange & misplaced attempt at humor, but then we get to the bridge battle and the movie begins to become mind-numbingly odd. I can't even describe how this movie descends swirling around the toilet bowl of absurdity before it flushes down to the sewer of utter madness. My head began to hurt the last half an hour; it was so supremely bizarre. It is hard to imagine how it gradually changes gears from a normal enough war movie to a drugged out nonsensical waste of time in the jungle! I'm not being facetious, I am serious, literally, my head actually hurts from my exercise in futility in trying to weave together this mess of loose ends.<br/><br/>Film critics can be such sheep. Sure you can be black sheep if you want, but you are every bit as much cowardly conformists as your more numerous mainstream counterparts; mindless cowardly conformity to a subgroup is still conformity. To argue this film a masterpiece requires a desperate search for figurative meaning, a smothering of common sense, and is a sad attempt at acceptance into a group of pseudo-intellectuals. This films reputation is because of who made it, when he made it, and groupthinkperiod. Colonel Kurtz was not some great free thinker (there have been many about whom films have been and could be made), nor was anyone in his outrageously improbable personality cult. How did he persuade this brutally savage & primitive people to exalt him by the way? How did he even communicate with them? I suppose he learned their languageright.<br/><br/>This is not a matter of taste. This movie is simply terrible, the story is crazily incongruent, and anyone with eyes to see and a mind to think will agree. The film itself is very well made, but that is not even close to enough to make the movie as a whole worthwhile. If you want a film about humanity's imperfections, if you want a film about the horrors, consequences, or idiocy of war, if you want a film about thinking for yourself and doing your own thing, if you want a film about political hypocrisy – whatever you want, please, just do yourself a favor and watch another movie. In fact, Apocalypse Now is so long you can watch two."

","I'm a middle aged, suburban bread, ordinary guy. Until yesterday I'd never seen Apocalypse Now. That makes me VERY UNORDINARY!<br/><br/>I count many war movies among my favorites including Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down and Band of Brothers and I really liked first two Godfather movies but somehow, I'd never seen Coppola's iconic Vietnam war movie. That makes me uniquely qualified (in my mind) to share my experience. Here goes:<br/><br/>Stories have been told and movies made about the difficulty of making this movie. The lead actor was dumped, the script was trashed, the cast and crew was stoned and the director didn't know how to end the movie. It shows! The story is very uncomplicated, Captain Willad (Sheen), a grizzled military assassin is ordered to track down a rogue colonel (Brando) in the jungles of Vietnam and Cambodia.<br/><br/>But really, this is an art movie! It is clear that Coppola wanted to show off his skills behind the camera. The entire film is an incredible contrast of color and darkness. Each and every scene is a piece of visual art and it's very distracting. It totally removes any sense of realism. It's the definition of ""theatrical."" Even more distracting is the non-stop synthesized 70's era soundtrack.<br/><br/>The lack of a script is obvious in almost every scene. I'd imagine 90 percent of Sheen's EXTENSIVE voice over work was added during the editing process in an attempt to pull the disjointed story together. In the end, the one and only story line was resolved (as foreshadowed a dozen times) and the screen faded to black.<br/><br/>This movie was probably a fraud dressed up like art in 1979.

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","5","7 November 2006"," There is no justice and no justification in any war
","A long awaited version of this cult film. Even Francis Ford Coppola has been submitted to cuts in one of his most important films. They say it was commercial. They know it was not entirely. One main scene was cut off : the French plantation scene that reveals how the Americans had played a double game during the war in Indochina between the Viet Minh and the French : they had helped the Viet Minh and hence had produced the French defeat. Poor loser's explanation, for sure, and yet not entirely false. Think of the Americans helping Saddam Hussein against Iran, or the Djihad in Afghanistan against the Soviets. We know the results. Double agents are always those who lose in the end. But this full and final cut of the film, though it does not change the meaning of the film, does change the depth of this meaning. We get down into horror little by little as we go up the river. Of the five men on the boat the first to die is the black soldier, and then the second to die is the black sergeant. The blacks have been eliminated first : quite a symbolical truth. The third victim will be the white soldier from New Orleans who speaks French. It is also very symbolical today, though maybe less in those days, though it was symbolical of what happened to the French in Indochina : they were defeated. The only two survivors are the two white pure Americans. But what is shown under a new depth is the meaning of this horror. We could have thought Kurtz used the basic and daily horror of those historically-retarded jungle people to impose savagery and total carnal violence. But what appears now is that it is not the savagery of these people that produced their war but it is the war imposed from outside that produced the savagery, or liberated this savagery from its box. In other words a war that comes from outside, and I have the propension to think all wars always come from outside, even the most patriotic and justified defensive war, such a war liberates the deepest layers of the survival instinct in man, not even the animal instinct of survival. These men who commit gratuitously-embellished violence do not plainly aim at surviving which would simply imply killing their adversaries, enemies or challengers.They survive in a completely different way : they have the feeling to be alive because they make the other die in atrocious suffering and in the most barbaric way. It is not so much the dying of the enemy that gives them this feeling of being alive, but the torture, the suffering, the horror in which this death is performed. In other words it is no longer only the survival instinct that is at stake but it is also the pleasure instinct. In other words they transform the cold necessary killing of an enemy into a hot pleasurable sexual event that replaces real sexuality. Killing in such a horrible way becomes a pleasurable intercourse and the victim is seen as fulfilling its destiny, just like the buffalo that is killed at the end of the film. A man who enters such a war is supposed to accept his dying in such a sacrificial way because that is his ultimate function. But then where is the war ? We have regressed to the emergence of humanity from animality, of man from the animal he was before : this dire moment when human beings felt that killing animals had a religious dimension, when human beings felt that killing their enemies had a religious dimension, that is to say in both cases a pleasurable power dimension. That led humanity to inventing religions, religions that originally always justified the killing of enemies and that provided the believers with the conviction that they had special powers enabling them with unfailing and totally justified capabilities, powers. But what will remain after this thrilling sensation of absolute power provided to soldiers by those sophisticated new technologies that kill with a microscopic precision ? The horror, nothing but the horror, the haunting and gnawing question : Why did I do this ? Why did I feel pleasure when doing it ? Why does it feel so easy to go beyond limits that should never be trespassed, such as into torturing activities ? And for us the film brings up one question : Is there a Kurtz in each one of us ? Is there an Eichman in each one of us ? Is there an Auschwitz in each one of our memories ? Coppola seems to tell us that war is a Pandora's Box that we better not open. Coppola is in phase with Clive Barker who tells you war, and maybe life, is a secret cube that you must not open because beyond it there is nothing but suffering and the pleasure of inflicting as well as receiving that suffering. The old film was a masterpiece, this new director's cut, or redux is a biblical masterpiece : think of Abraham who is going to sacrifice his own son with the full assent of everyone around him, or at least no protest from them, including the son himself, and God replacing the son with a ram at the very last minute to symbolize that humanity has to move away from any type of human sacrifice, even in war. Human life is sacred and no human being has the right to take one single human life away. That's where Kurtz is wrong : everyone has the right to judge him, to call him a murderer, but no one has the right to perform justice and to kill him to do so, except in a completely perverted version of rightfulness.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

A yellow tinged filter applied to the majority of the shots to highlight the fire and harsh sunlight. The lighting was exquisitely minimal to enhance shadowy figures and the darkness of the jungle. Coppola's direction is yet again perfect. The narrative was consistently paced. The build up of Colonel Kurtz as a character was stupendous. He was portrayed to be a myth, a legend, with such anonymity yet with ominous overshadowing. Martin Sheen took on a transformative role and portrayed his character with class. A no nonsense captain who's mind is solely focussed on his classified objective. The supporting cast were good, albeit slightly unmemorable (except Robert Duvall). The lavish action set pieces were grand in scale and the mass usage of explosives made the depiction of war feel authentic. But...there lies my problem. On one half the narrative explores the war and its devastation, the other it attempts to expand on the psychological analysis of said war. The two didn't marinate. The only character that evolved psychologically was the captain. Everyone else was just there to exist and further the plot. It wasn't really executed intelligently. Then the confrontation with Kurtz felt like a let down. Brando's performance was great, but his character really didn't feel insane. It was subtly ambiguous, but his build up was loud and clear so it felt like a juxtaposition. Epic war film, mediocre psychological drama."

","I just watched the ""Redux"" extended version of this film.  I watched it after reading a number of these comments.  I think my tastes in movies are rather broad; they include epic adventure and war movies--I like the Lord of the Rings movies very much, The Last of the Mohicans, Saving Private Ryan, etc.  Still, this movie left me quite underwhelmed!  I'm not saying that I wasn't -affected- by the movie, but the effect it had was to sober me to life, but at the same time to put me into a strange post-LONG-movie stupor. And so I spent 3-1/2 hours of my life watching this movie--one of the best of all time?--and I saw no value in it!  I wasn't entertained, educated, or encouraged to do anything about anything.  I call that a waste of time, even though--as others have noted--the cinematography was masterful.  Many other movies have great cinematography: watch one of them."
"stamper","5","1","6","27 November 2002"," Did I miss something?
","Apocalypse Now is one of those classics' I did not find so classic at all. Maybe it is because I missed something, but I really do not understand what all the fuss is about here. The story develops very slowly, there is almost nothing of the horrorthe horror and although the insanity of war is presented by soldiers we see going nuts, we get no explanation for that insanity. It might be that I'm just too young, but maybe someone will be able to explain this films greatness' to me someday. Personally I believe, this film is so highly regarded, only because it was made shortly after the Vietnam war and handled some subjects the Americans rather hadn't seen on their plates. Marlon Brando certainly did the film some good but was not around long enough to make it good.<br/><br/>

","Most people that I know hailed Apocalypse Now as the greatest and strongest war film ever made, however I have a slightly different approach to this film. As it said in that above title, this entire movie is weird, it seems to drag on struggling for greatness, but it never quite gets there. The whole film is based on Martin Sheen hunting down Marlon Brando to terminate with extreme prejudice. But so much time is wasted on such unnecessary factors, such as Brando's character development, and the Playboy bunnies who entertain the soldiers in Vietnam, a scene that seemed to come out of nowhere. To be fair, this is not at all a bad film, but I believe that it is the film's own excesses that drag it down, failing to achieve the goal that it so desperately wants to achieve."
"MyDarkStar","8","1","6","5 December 2001"," Overrated !
","I'm a very big fan of ""The Godfather I & II"" (notice I didn't say III). With that said, everytime I hear the title ""Apocalypse Now"" the first word that automatically pops into my head is the word ""overrated"".<br/><br/>This movie had almost as much hype to it as Harry Potter. It also was the most expensive movie ever made at the time. Yet, after watching it time after time after time, I can't help but think that half the budget went into Brando's pocket.<br/><br/>This movie has never has ""connected"" with me. God knows I have given it plenty of chances (I've probably watched it about 10 times). Everytime I see it I keep telling myself ""This is going to be the time that I understand what all the fuss is about""....but it never happens.<br/><br/>This movie was made in 1979, approximately five years after the last American troops left VietNam. Personally, I think that is a significant factor in the popularity of this movie. I believe in 1979 Americans were JUST starting to accept the fact that we actually lost the war (and I mean on a very wide scale - just beginning to accept). This movie plays into that mentality by showing a General who is going against his orders. It also shows disillusioned American soldier looking for answers. I think people saw one of the great American directors coming out with a ""Vietnam"" movie (starring one of the all-time greatest actors) portraying the American troops that way, and instantly deemed it a ""classic"".<br/><br/>It seems as though it kinda gave alot of Americans something to refer to and point at and say ""see, that's what it was like""...because of the names involved. So the testosterone started flowing, college dorms started putting up the movie poster, and next thing you know a huge snowball effect had started, and ""Apocalypse Now"" was more-less deemed the standard when it came to Vietnam movies.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong ""Apocalypse Now"" has some great moments. Some of the camera work in it is really breathtaking. But to call it a classic is simply ridiculous."

","I just watched Apocalypse Now a few days ago and was not impressed.  Yes, the movie did have a few well known actors in and out of every scene, but that doesn't really mean anything.  Some say it's a classic because it's dark, moody, and realistic.  Well, I say Platoon and Full Metal Jacket are just that and are more deserving of someone's time than Apocalypse Now. Overall, I didn't see anything that I haven't seen before.  I hardly even believe that watching Apocalypse Now is worth your time unless you want to view an overrated film."

","I had seen this critically acclaimed war film maybe once or twice, but maybe I didn't pay the fullest of attention to everything or perhaps didn't get it, but I am glad I gave it another chance and can appreciate it now, from BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather, The Conversation, Bram Stoker's Dracula). Basically the Vietnam war shows no signs of ending, and U.S. Army Captain and special operations veteran Captain Benjamin L. Willard (BAFTA nominated Martin Sheen) has returned to Saigon and called upon by Lt. General Corman (G. D. Spradlin) and Colonel Lucas (Harrison Ford), military intelligence officers, for a secret mission into the remote jungle. His orders are to follow the Nung River and find Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone rogue, and apparently insane practising ""unsound"" methods of dehumanisation, and he may have also developed a cult following from both his troops and the native people, so he is to be terminated for extreme prejudice. Willard heads down the river on a Navy patrol boat, commanded by Chief Phillips (Albert Hall) with crew members Lance B. Johnson (Sam Bottoms), Jay 'Chef' Hicks (Frederic Forrest) and Tyrone 'Clean' Miller (Laurence Fishburne), and on the journey they rendezvous Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who commands a squadron of armed helicopters, he agrees to escort them while the napalm airstrike attacks the locals below, while the music ""Ride of the Valkyries"" plays on loudspeakers. Willard and the crew continue upriver, he looks through files about Kurtz and how was once a promising officer, they encounter Vietnamese civilians on the way, but a snap judgement gets them killed, he and Chief get in each other's faces, and Willard later finds out that another soldier was sent on a similar mission to kill Kurtz, but this soldier defected and joined the cult the rogue commander has created. Lance and Chef are under the influence of drugs are getting out of control, Mr. Clean is killed when the boat is attacked by an unseen enemy in the trees, Chief turns hostile, but they are ambushed again and he is killed being impaled by a spear, but Willard confides with surviving members Chef and Lance who reluctantly agree to continue on the mission, and upriver they find a bank littered with corpses. While Chef is able to leave and call an airstrike, the other two soldiers end up captured by Montagnard warriors, and they meet an eccentric Photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) who praises Kurtz as a genius, the soldiers see several heads scattered outside a temple, the cult leader's temple, Willard is taken to see him in the dark lair, he sees him as an errand boy, and Willard screams as Chef's severed head is dropped on his lap. Willard is released and free to explore the compound, Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, humanity and civilisation, Kurtz wants him to tell his son everything about him in the event of his death, but he kills the cult leader with a machete, his dying words are ""The horror... the horror"". Covered with dark stuff on his face, and having read the written chilling words of the now dead commander, and taking them, he descends from Kurtz's chamber and drops the blood covered weapon, the villagers kneel like he is their new cult leader, but he and Lance are allowed to leave and get back to the boat, having experienced all this devastation they ride away with the last words of Kurtz eerily echoing. The performances by Sheen, Brando, Duvall and Hopper are all very good for the characters they portray, and the direction by Coppola is masterful, there were loads of problems during the making of the film, such as firing Harvey Keitel from the lead role, and Sheen having a heart attack, but the idea was to create an idea of what being in Vietnam would be like, and indeed you get that sense of surrealism messing with your mind and the danger of the environment, it is a very interesting epic war drama. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Carmine and Francis Ford Coppola, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Sound Track and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Dennis Hopper was number 80, Marlon Brando number 30, and Harrison Ford number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Brando was also number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and Hopper was number 49, and Brando number 1 on The World's Greatest Actor, ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning"" was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 2 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 1 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, it was number 28 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Films.

","Being in my twenties and never seen this movie, I decided it was time to do so since its high rating on IMDB. The pace starts good and soon the squad is on its way to take out a rogue soldier. They team up with another group that needs to help them out on the river. They do so and their journey continues. What follows are unnecessary scenes and slow pacing. Most shocking was that they arrive at some base with a huge show. At that moment I was thinking: What the heck was all that stuff about travelling with their boat and that big fight in that village when they could just have flown to that military base with the show??? Afterwards they came in some half deserted base where to those Miss july's etc. are holed up. What are such national celebrities doing in run down base that do not even have normal tents? More funny was that they apparently offer intercourse for oil. Like what? I guess I try that next time I go out as well.<br/><br/>So far I did not continue with the movie yet but I do plan to do so. But people calling this the greatest movie is just nostalgia speaking (pink tainted goggles on their eyes while watching this average war movie) Some others talk about the horrors of war this movie shows.

"haroldareynoldsIV","7","1","8","7 August 2017"," Review as if it was just released today
","For years I heard so much about Apocalypse Now, but just tonight I finally got around to watching it. Since so much has already been said about its importance, significance, and achievements, I'm going to do a raw review, like I just watched a brand new movie that came out today so rather than analyze, I'll be a reactionary film-goer just exiting the theater.<br/><br/>Wow, this movie is crazy! It is one of the craziest movies I have ever seen. <br/><br/>From a technical perspective, it is really phenomenal. Coppola directs a stunning depiction of the Vietnam war as a backdrop for the story of a man on a classified mission to find a former well-respected Colonel who has lost his mind in the midst of the war and is now running some kind of a cult in Cambodia with a small colony of Vietnamese, Vietcong, and Cambodians in the jungle. <br/><br/>Most of the aspects of the film are perfect, from the acting to the directing, writing, cinematography, action sequences, and editing. In addition, there are several unforgettable characters (Kilgore) and some unforgettable lines along the way (I love the smell of napalm in the morning).<br/><br/>But the story itself is insane as it unfolds and you get to eventually see Colonel Kurtz, the mad soldier who went astray from his command and formed some crazy pagan-worshipping like cult, where he is some sort of high priest of some sort. <br/><br/>I still am not sure what to think about it. I don't know how much I like the film because the end is sort of disturbing and open to interpretation. all I know is it seems possible to assume that the whole entire point of the film was to expose and reveal the horrors of war, especially the Vietnam war. It is not a movie that is meant to take lightly, it seems. <br/><br/>It is more of a social commentary on the questions of war. For that, I would say it succeeded in most ways, but for a movie that is going to become one of your favorites because of entertainment purposes, it won't be that kind of movie. While some parts, you'd want to watch again (anything with Kilgore and a few of the scenes in the beginning), as a whole it doesn't have much rewatch value. But it is definitely a riveting film and technically it is excellent. The story, however, is just a little too disturbing and dark to become a favorite. <br/><br/>I'll give it a high score for the technical achievements, but it is not even close to being one of my favorites because in the end I thought the story was too dark and needed more explanation. For example, we knew the guy was nuts from the beginning, and while it was hinted he might be a genius, he never spoke anything that was totally mind blowing and his character therefore could have been developed more once the assassin arrived. The open interpretation works as a contemplative trick to produce an uncanny reaction and unique response, but more explanation or perhaps more plot development once the film arrived at Kurtz would have actually worked even better, and the potential was there. <br/><br/>7/10"

","I watched this film, as I am currently working through a lot of the films that you are meant to have seen before you die. I was very excited about this title, but must say I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>A bizarre tale about an assassin in the Vietnam war, a large portion of the story takes place on a boat that's ambling down rivers, encountering oddballs and little else.<br/><br/>It makes the American Military at the time seem like a heap of buffoons at best, with a commanding officer insisting on trying to surf in the midst of a land invasion in one of the most surreal war scenes I've ever seen. Very unrealistic and completely broke my immersion.<br/><br/>Performances are non-compelling, all Martin Sheen had to do throughout the films over 3 hours duration was stare into the middle distance, and it was still poorly acted. None of the characters have a compelling arc, with most being downright annoying, so when one of them dies, you find yourself all but thankful.<br/><br/>I would say at least 90% of the film is pure irrelevancy, having nothing to do with the plot, making it very verbose and a struggle to see through to the end, which turned out to be an overwrought monologue by Marlon Brando, before he is hacked apart, with images interspersed of a cow being pointlessly mutilated.<br/><br/>All I took away from the film was some facts about Ray Dolby, as I got bored, and started reading articles on Wikipedia.<br/><br/>I gave it three stars, as I thought there was some interesting imagery, and the sounds was actually quite good."

","Set during the Vietnam War, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is assigned a mission to assassinate a man known as Colonel Kurtz. The Captain is told that Kurtz has gone rogue and is now leading a small tribe as an army. Kurtz is also being treated as a ""God- Like"" figure by the people who surround him and is considered highly dangerous. Captain Willard accepts his mission.<br/><br/>I love how this film begins. Without giving too much away, the audience gets an insight about the current life of Captain Willard thanks to his inner narration. Once the Captain has received and accepts his mission, the film is well and truly underway.<br/><br/>As Captain Willard begins his journey to Cambodia to hunt down Kurtz, he is joined by a small group of fellow American soldiers who will assist him in completing his mission. Apocalypse Now never feels like a boring film. At all times I found myself engaged with the film's story, but I was also passionate to see how this mission of Captain Willard's came to an end. The film goes above and beyond to create suspense and loads of tension, which makes the viewer more determined to see the outcomes of their journey. Needless to say there is a great change in key characters as they progress further throughout the film.<br/><br/>As for the film's visuals... there is lots to love thanks to the director, Francis Ford Coppola (best known for also directing the Godfather before this film). Our director wanted to achieve something different and greater than anything he has done before. I would comment and say that what he set out to do he has done successfully. From the opening sequence alone viewers will witness a true audio- visual masterpiece. Watching this film on Bluray I was surprised and speechless as to how good it looks considering its age. From a filming aspect, I would to say that if it were to be released in cinemas today as a new film it would stand along with the many other great war films we have seen before. To say it clearly, this is an incredible war/drama film and comes highly recommended for the Audio and visual lovers out there (bring on a 4K Edition please).<br/><br/>Overall, Apocalypse Now comes highly recommended and is classed as a must watch from Finesse Movie Reviews. With jaw dropping cinematography and brilliant performances from Martin Sheen & Marlon Brando, you will be thirsty for more. After watching this film the 1st time, I honestly started rewatching it again right after. Considering this was filmed in 1979, thanks to Bluray and remastering technology, it's incredible to see just how great this film looks (especially if you comparing to films in cinema today). The making of features on the Bluray set is also worth your time watching as it's incredible to hear the about this film's developing journey.<br/><br/>10/10

","Apocalypse Now is not a war movie. Conceived initially from Joseph Conrad's book Heart of Darkness, which tells of the pursuit of an adventurer in the jungles of the Congo, he was transposed into the Vietnam War, where he certainly found a scenario even gloomier than the original story.<br/><br/>What you see in the movie are guns. Weapons that, at first glance, would be the most obvious element of a ""war"" movie, but which, during the narrative, show their power to bring forth the horror and power of destruction that, we discover, dwells in each one of us.<br/><br/>The main plot shows Captain Willard, from the so-called ""special forces"" (read license to kill), who, like a backward Ulysses, heads to a remote location on the battlefield in Cambodia, with the mission of exterminating the Colonel Kurtz, a decorated officer who, insane, starts to command an army of mountaineers as if he were a demigod.<br/><br/>On board a US Navy patrol boat in the company of four crew members, the captain climbs the Nùng River on a mind-blowing bad trip laden with icons of the American way of life as background for destruction.<br/><br/>Thus, a surfing competition is why Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (who loves the smell of napalm in the morning) destroys all the vegetation of an island. On a routine inspection on a fishing boat, a puppy becomes a motive for slaughter. Two of the boat's characters are equally ridiculously killed.<br/><br/>Strangely, the encounter with Colonel Kurtz (the moment we finally find Marlon Brando, though half hidden by Vittorio Storaro's magical lenses) is not as shocking as the expectation of reviewing the best actor in the world in action.<br/><br/>But nothing, neither the revivals nor alternative endings nor criticism nor problems of production take from Apocalypse Now the brilliance of being one of the darker films already released, and one of the majors in the history of the cinema."
"AleksandrBelenko","9","0","2","19 March 2019"," Post-Apocalyptic review
","Several days ago I watched this movie for the first time. The movie is a long lived classic, that I know as long as I live, but never was too interested in it. The version I have is is over 3 hours long. Currently holds #50 of 250 best movies with raiting 8.4. The review might content spoilers.
The movie has a slow pace narration, which feels even slower in director´s cut version. Though anyone who watched previous Coppola/Brando work - ""Godfather"" will find the pace comforting.
The music and the scenery ooze you into dark and terrorising atmosphere of war. There are no fun mments in this movie. Pure depretion. Either Americans bombard the natives or natives bomb Americans. Many scenes are filmed in the rain and moments of good weather are shown during thoughts of protagonist about his mission and war in itself. The lighter parts accompanied by presence of girls dancing or being naked, or guys talking about naked girls. That is understandable, the guys are soldiers and lacking female attention. But even those scenes are followed by unfortunate events in any way.
Yet again, the movie portraits the war greatly, in its unique way. The boat trip, so called adventure of the crew is full of struggles. Mostly moral. Author shows horror of war in his own manner. And then there is the scene of comming to native tribe by main characters.
Cambodians are portrayed as somewhat wild, uncivilized people, using straws, sticks and spears to kill Americans. That creates a dissonance as they live in ruins of great architectural value an aesthetic beauty.
We find out by some French photographer, that Cambodian tribe thinks of Colonel, as their father. Obviously, for the crew of newcomers he is crazy and evil. Willard plans to find the Colonel and finish the mission.
The main character is dragged by tribe members to Colonel, who asks him standart questions. And what he says after the place on Ohio river , the flower plantation, which leads to the speech about freedom.
That part is philosophic yet prosaic. They talk about Willard´s mission, if he is an assassin. So Willard responds to it, saying he is a soldier. Colonel says that he is neither. In my opinion that is the best scene in the movie.
Finally main character resolves his struggles by finnishing the mission. Or does he?
Overall it is a good movie. Slow paced during first half though. After watching this film I had a feeling as if I´ve read some epic novel.
How do I feel after watching the movie? How should I feel?
I definitely like cinematography, and the playing is good. It deals with psycological aspect of war and I enjoyed it as it is distinct to most of the war movies, that either show battles or spy operation.
I would like to say that it is great movie that is providing new perspective on war. As much as I enjoyed this movie during watching it, I will not rewatch it at all. No that is not that type of movie."

","""Apocalypse Now"" has a lot to say about colonialism and American interventionism, and some unintended statements about how the West -- white folks -- see the rest of the world. Conrad's original novella compared the darkness in men's hearts to the unknown interior of Africa, and the movie draws similar comparisons to the jungles of Southeast Asia. Both stories feature characters journeying upriver and slowly losing their civilized, Western identities.<br/><br/>But the stronger effect of the movie is its bold redefinition of the aesthetics of war. Older war movies showcased a different sort of martial spectacle: uniforms, discipline, and impressive formations of soldiers, tanks, and airplanes. War was a pageant choreographed to stirring marches. In those days, war was a good thing, a struggle against evil and tyranny.<br/><br/>In ""Apocalypse Now"", the soldiers are shirtless young men, smoking joints and blasting rock music as they joyride up the river, terrorizing the locals. The enemy is barely seen. War is more like an anarchic gap year: there's no authority, no structure, but plenty of intoxicants to enjoy along the way. If you're into that sort of thing, it can be a great time. Surfing, LSD, machine guns, Playboy bunnies. When Colonel Kilgore says, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning,"" you know there's nowhere else he'd rather be.<br/><br/>It's this aesthetic that makes the biggest impression, much more than the anti-war or anti-colonial messages. Vietnam, according to Coppola and his screenwriters, is a place where there is no responsibility, no morality, a place where a young man can massacre an entire family with a machine-gun and get away with it. Actions don't have consequences, and when death inevitably comes it does so randomly and unpredictably. Violence is a risk you take, something you live with, but not something you really have to think about.<br/><br/>I don't know if that's what Coppola intended. He probably thought the sight of armed helicopters obliterating a Vietnamese village to the sound of ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" would be ironic and shocking, rather than exciting. To most people watching the film, it probably just looks like fun."

","IMO, this is one of the greatest movies made. In terms of direction, cinematography & the sheer scale of the enterprise, it represents a major achievement. In its portrayal of the craziness of the Vietnam war, the eccentric performances of Brando, Hopper & Duvall are unforgettable. I thought the redux version that was released years after the original offered little of great value & the original was well left alone. I've watched this movie many times since & have never tired of it. The eerie Doors' music adds to that other worldly feel.

"Mackiatoe","10","0","3","6 January 2019"," The ultimate cinematic experience.
","As far as cinematic experiences go, this is hands-down the best.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is not conventional. Instead, it is a masterfully choreographed, mesmerising exploration of what evil and darkness truly are, being a soldier means, the terrible way in which the US fought the Vietnam war and a representation of what insanity ""is"". In some weird, almost sadistic way, it could even be seen as a set of short stories. But that's far too simple.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is built on incredibly strong foundations, not least because of its inspiration from Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. Its underlying story is rakishly simple: our protagonist has to go down a river and kill the antagonist. You cannot go wrong there; the motivation for our characters is dead set. And that means that there's plenty of space for Coppola to build up an authentic, worryingly realistic and terrifying world that is ""Vietnam"". Yet it's not an accurate representation, mainly because it's not supposed to be. Other Vietnam films do that job - instead, Apocalypse Now creates the atmosphere of the war and then sets a fictional, philosophical story within that. It is a stroke of genius.<br/><br/>I don't know how to begin dissecting this film, and I don't think I'll ever be able to summarise it entirely. All at once, it is a criticism of the Vietnam war, an attack on the way militaries work, an exploration of what madness and darkness truly mean and a story of the potent power of insanity. Conrad's themes which were aptly explored in his fantastic novel are blown up to incredible scale here and realised in overwhelming relevant and brilliant fashion.<br/><br/>And that's before you get onto its other, groundbreaking aspects. The cinematography, for instance, it astounding. Symbolism is used extensively to fantastic effect; just look at the scene where Kurtz talks to Willard about him being killed - it's groundbreaking in multiple ways. Then there's the use of lighting, one of the strongest visual metaphors in the film. In almost every scene, especially the show at Hau Phat and the Do Long bridge, it plays a pivotal role in creating atmosphere and conveying the message of the film. Sound too is incredible. The score is a mix of Kraftwerk-esque dark synth sounds, The End by The Doors and the all famous Ride of the Valkyries.<br/><br/>You don't so much watch Apocalypse Now as do you experience it, live it and breathe it. It lingers in your mind for days after, constantly bringing up questions as to what the hell you actually watched. It's one of those films that gives you goosebumps just thinking about it.<br/><br/>There can be no denying that this is one of the most profoundly disturbing and truly scary films of all time. I certainly rank it as the scariest film I've ever seen because of its potency, a potency that have left me thinking about Apocalypse Now for longer than I could ever have contemplated. All at once the most awe-inspiring of actions films, the most brutally realistic of war films and the darkest, most desecrating of psychological thrillers; the most intense cinematic experience I've yet come across."

The hidden message of the movie was the catastrophe that war war brings in the minds and hearts of men; the horror it creates and the disturbance it brings.

All of it which made its name at the time, but its reputation now is based on the film, which still works today, with some epic set pieces, and excellent depiction of the lunacy of the Vietnam war, and a flawed, but still interesting, journey into the madness and immorality of war in general."
"tyson-hunsaker","10","0","1","31 July 2018"," A psychological journey into the human heart of darkness.
","""Apocalypse Now"" has been hailed as not only one of the best war films ever made but as one of the greatest films ever created. The mighty status is definitely earned but on an individual level, must be discovered after several careful viewings. It's a film with much depth, substance, and meaning than one can divulge in one viewing. It's a profound piece of cinema that continues to stagger above the rest as a fiction with a lot to say. <br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola and his incredible team achieved what could be the creative climax of his career. Based on the novella by Joseph Conrad (having read the book I believe inspired might be a more appropriate word), the story follows a U.S. military captain and chronicles his journey up the Vietnam and Cambodia river to find and terminate a rouge Colonel.<br/><br/>Technically, the film, both the theatrical and redux versions both show superior craftsmanship in not only telling a great story but in suggesting feelings and thoughts to the audience through meticulous editing, sound, music, and cinematography. Edited by the great Walter Murch, ""Apocalypse Now"" is cut together beautifully with tremendously enthralling pacing and tempo. Even with the redux version clocking in at over three hours, the film never feels dull or uninteresting. Each sequence presents something new to think about and ponder and adds to the previous sequence. <br/><br/>Of the few academy awards it won, cinematography contributed highly to the film's overall atmosphere and meaning. Providing nuance and complexity to the characters, this film is shot gorgeously with dreamlike contrast and surreal color. As the story progresses, we see how the filmmakers used the lighting of day to tell the story in the editing room. The beginning of the film reflects a lighter sunrise feel to the picture as the journey begins. Near the end, we gradually see less and move towards the sunset of the story. Until the very climax shot in the dark twilight of night. As the cinematographic aesthetics reflect the gradual change in character through the darkness, so too does the audience take the journey along until they no longer know how they feel or what they think. <br/><br/>Narratively speaking, the story's progression and sequences of events may be off-putting to some viewers. Some have complained that the film's direction is random and confusing which makes it difficult to understand the theme of the piece. I would say it's important to understand that ""Apocalypse Now"", much like ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad, is allegorical. It's a symbolic and psychological journey into the darkness of the human heart. Each scene does indeed not only become easier to accept over several viewings, but the meaning behind each scene is there.<br/><br/>For any film-lover, ""Apocalypse Now"" is a must see. Each piece of the film provides a profound commentary on the human condition while also making anti-war statements which have always been relevant. It's a film for those who are ready to surrender and be completely affected by what the film has to say. It may not be for everyone but it sure is an experience that must be felt by everyone. In my opinion, ""Apocalypse Now"" is indeed one of the greatest films ever made and continues to impress me with each viewing."
"Equalizer16","10","0","1","5 August 2017"," Here are my thoughts
","After a long journey in pursuing this film, I finally got my hands on Frances Ford Coppola's epic war movie Apocalypse Now (1979). With two accidental purchases of the Redux, version, my anticipation for the original feature was high and hoped my efforts have been worth it. So this is my review/analysis (some slight SPOILERS) During the orange heat of the Vietnam War in 69, isolated Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is tasked with a classified mission of seeking out and terminating Colonel Walter E Kurtz: (Marlon Brando) a officer who has gone insane and become a demi-god among his own native followers in Cambodia leading his own war attacks against the Vietnamese and US. As Willard pursues the fragmented dictator, him and his unit explore the dark depths of the war.<br/><br/>From Robert Duvall's famous battle line of ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning"" to Brando's harrowing whispers of the ""the horror, the horror"" Apocalypse Now takes a revolutionary journey of war, morality and truth, such a transition is a rare expedition for cinema. Arguably one of the deepest, heaviest films to be made to date, Coppla's work in my eyes is a poetic tale of Vietnam War or war in general. To be perfectly honest, the films wade on me too much for me to even conjure an opinion yet.<br/><br/>To someone with no idea of the context of the film, the title 'Apocalypse Now' probably suggests a post apocalyptic setting, but it is more complicated than that. Now titles are very important to me, and I can't help but partly try to consider what the title means while watching the film, until its explained itself. So I'll admit throughout the 2hr and 33mins duration that 15% of mind was trying to work it out while the remaining 75% was fully focused. And what typically ends is being one of those titles with multiple interpretations or implications based on what you have witnessed on screen. The gratifying majority opinion agrees that the title's significance represents the weight of horror and terror in the Vietnam war There's one line that implies soldiers forget their home lives and there is only the war. Coppola shades the majority of the film in a ghastly brown orange colour pallet, mimicking the sandy environment but possibly the horrific atmosphere of a post apocalyptic world. So the title should probably make perfect sense, if I was in Nam at that time, I'd probably think its the apocalypse too.<br/><br/>What we find the character of Willard enter is a revolutionary experience of the war, which gets him early closer to Kurtz. Willard is fascinated by the mad Colonel story and continues to read his file throughout his mission. Each part of the war they encounter along the way only builds up intrigue and gradual understanding for Kurtz so called insanity. Coppola slowly constructs great tension and anticipation as we get tot know the character of Kurtz through his file, and await the confrontation. Brando's voice only springs sinister. What we discover is a damaged soldier tired of the killing but still welcoming it as it all he has. There's no doubt about it that Brando is creepy as a ghost, and sees the only truth in the world is continuous destruction demonstrating his sight of the real apocalypse that we live in.<br/><br/>One masterful aspect that Coppola constructs in Apocalypse Now, is its magnificent cinematic presence. Brought to live sensationally by Vittorio Storaro's cinematography amazingly capturing the extreme, and at times documentary character to the Vietnam War. Featuring one of the most fierce battle scene when the choppers arrive and begin shooting down below with the sound of Ride of the Valkyries (one of the most influential moments in film history).<br/><br/>Coppola's 1979 work earns the name as a work of genius and master art, one of the most 'mad' and heavy pieces of cinema standing against the weight and horror of the Vietnam War, and war itself. I would agree this was an important point in cinema history to be witnessed by all."

","Apocalypse Now is a 1979 war drama starring Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Laurance Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, and Harrison Ford. The story follows Captain Benjamin L.

Captain Willard is tasked with assassinating Colonel Walter Kurtz, played by Brando, who has committed war crimes. Willard's journey drags him through the horrors of the Vietnam War, facing AWOL units, Viet Cong, and death.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is a powerful film with a great soundtrack and an all-star cast. The acting and the writing are great. The movie can be politically poignant at times, and is incredibly moving throughout.<br/><br/>The only criticisms that I could make of Apocalypse Now is the occasional, overly dramatic, almost cartoonish, death scenes and intoxication scenes. The world constructed in this film is also a bit over-the-top. It seems that every character in the story is insane.<br/><br/>Overall, Apocalypse Now is a great film. This war drama has action, thrills, and adventure that can satisfy all adult audiences."
"The_Hateful_Citizen","7","0","1","2 July 2017"," The Redux is perhaps the worst mistake of Mr. Coppola's career
","Apocalypse Now, a cult movie, or rather, two cult movies. There are two versions of this film, a release in 1979 that lasts (already) 2:20 and a release in 2001 called ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" that lasts 3:15. I made a mistake, I looked the version ""Redux"". Why is this version available? 45 more minutes that do not serve anything, it's really stupid. Let us now turn to the film itself. The film is intriguing, we get into it, through a captain Willard played by Martin Sheen who is very good and endearing, furthermore it must be said, it's true that the attack scene with helicopters is mythical. The basic scenario of this film is good and it shows well the absurdity of the Vietnam's war and had better still show it in 1979 at the release of the film. However one begins to feel a film more boring and annoying a little after spending the two hours, the film becomes worse. And what about the appearance of Colonel Kurtz played by Brando who, when looking at the Director's Cut version, is expected for almost three hours? Disappointing, that's what it is, I was expecting something epic but no, it's just naught. Finally, after seeing the scenes that were added in the long version, I told myself that I would have appreciated much more this film in ""normal"" version, so I decided to note somewhat the two versions, the 2:20' version will deserve for me 8/10 when in the Redux' version, it does not deserve more than 6/10 for me, so, (8 + 6) ÷ 2 = 7/10, which makes Apocalypse Now a ""well movie"" whereas it could have been an excellent film without this Redux. The Redux is perhaps the worst mistake of Mr. Coppola's career."

","Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is a masterpiece. It's in-depth look at the Vietnam war and the horrors of the event is intriguing and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>A few things I would recommend to people who enjoy this movie or didn't like the film are the following-<br/><br/>1) Read into the making of this film. I find it incredible the amount of pain and sacrifice that went into crafting this film. The ""war stories"" of the making of this film are truly incredible.<br/><br/>2) Read the book. It provides much more philosophy into the ideas and themes of the story. <br/><br/>3) Perhaps watch reviews and analysis' of the film. Channel Criswell has a wonderful analysis on the movie that I would recommend to everyone.<br/><br/>If you still don't enjoy this movie, or at least appreciate it, after these steps, I don't know if there's much hope for you. <br/><br/>Yours Truly,<br/><br/>Cinema Swagmaster"

","In 1967, during the Vietnam War, Army Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) has gone insane and now commands his own Montagnard troops inside neutral Cambodia as a demi-god. Colonel Lucas (Harrison Ford) and General Corman (G.D. Spradlin), who are growing increasingly concerned with Kurtz's renegade operations, assign U.S. Army Captain and Studies and Observations Group veteran Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) to terminate the Colonel's command with extreme prejudice.<br/><br/>Ambivalent about the mission, Willard joins a Navy Patrol boat, riverine (PBR) commanded by ""Chief"" (Albert Hall) and crewmen Lance (Sam Bottoms), ""Chef"" (Frederic Forrest) and ""Mr. Clean"" (Laurence Fishburne) to head upriver. They rendezvous with surfing enthusiast Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall), a commander of a cavalry squadron, to discuss going up the Nung river. Kilgore initially scoffs at them, but befriends Lance when he discovers he is an expert surfer and agrees to escort them through the Viet Cong-held coastal mouth of the river where surfing conditions are particularly good. At dawn the helicopter raid commences. Amid the attack, Kilgore calls in a napalm sortie on the local cadres and the rivermouth is taken. Willard gathers his men to the PBR, which has been transported via helicopter, and begins the journey up river.<br/><br/>Tension arises between Chief and Willard as Willard believes himself to be in command of the PBR while Chief prioritizes other objectives over Willard's secret mission. Slowly making their way upriver, Willard reveals part of his mission to the Chief to assuage the Chief's concerns about why his mission should take precedence. As night falls, the PBR reaches the chaotic last US outpost on the NÃ¹ng river, the Do Long bridge. Willard and Lance enter the base seeking information on what is upriver. Unable to find anyone in command of the base, Willard orders the Chief to continue upriver as an unseen enemy launches a strike on the bridge."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) is to simply put - a true movie masterpiece. There isn't anything new that can say in a praise for this movie. This is one of a few best war movies ever made, and this is simply one of the top 5 movies ever made. <br/><br/>I don'e even know where should i start to praise this movie. This movie is probably one of the cases where you not only ""love it"" or ""hate it"" - ""Apocalypse Now"" won't leave anyone, and by anyone i mean casual or true movie buff in some way ""unmoved"" - it has everything (well maybe except for a love story- but save that for a ""Director's Cut""). <br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" is in some sort a ""road movie"". It is also a ""war movie"". It is also a ""finding yourself"" or even ""coming of age story"". It is about finding a true horror in surrounding of nature, and how this horror becomes part of you. But no matter the way in which you will see this masterpiece - one thing is clear - it is simply one of the best movies ever made. <br/><br/>Overall, i saw the original cut like 3 or 4 times, and 2 times ""Director's Cut"". For all rookies of ""Apocalypse Now"" I would recommend the original cut first, and after this masterpiece will become a part of your mind, then you can see ""Director's Cut"" - it is a deeper road into a rabbit hole."

","This movie needs to be watched multiple times, it's simply that good and definitely one of my all time favorites! It is by far the best Vietnam war movie I have seen due to its great camera-work. The dialogue is very impressive. But the music used makes some of the scenes in this movie instant classics! Francis Ford Coppola delivered a classic here and makes you feel you're part of the war. Also the famous and nowadays legendary (some still pretty young) actors in this movie brought this to another level.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend people to watch the ""Redux"" version (a 2001 extended version of this movie) since it's considered the best version available and adds another 49 minutes of footage left out of the original version."

","A good war-film should do two things. Firstly, unflinchingly portray the brutalities of war and secondly demonstrate the unshakeable bond that soldiers share with each other. Apocalypse Now ticks both of these boxes. Despite how Robert Duvall has only fifteen minutes of screen time, he is brilliant as a psychotic American colonel. He is by far one of the best parts of the film. Perhaps even better than Marlon Brando. I was very disappointed with Brando's contribution. He had little to no presence and was largely forgettable in his role as the film's antagonist. Also at two and a half hours, the film's pace does drag a little and it gets boring at times.<br/><br/>Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/pw044Z"

","I think this film is very strange to say the last. Apocalypse Now is an amazing piece of cinema. It's really one of the finest films around and is the Citizen Kane of Vietnam movies. In this film, with excellent camera work, an impeccably chosen sound track and legendary performances make for one of the greatest war epics of all time. Apocalypse Now captures the madness and terror of war, perhaps most perfectly in any scene not directly dealing with combat. The simple hunt for a surfing spot or the bizarre USO show scenes are more rattling than the movies' visceral gory moments. A viewer is inescapably left with a deep sense of unease and confusion throughout this film. Overall in my opinion, this is a classic Vietnam war film, and it is good, that is it's made well and it's an interesting story, but I didn't care much for it. Mostly because it's very slow, but that's part of the atmosphere of it, I guess. If you like Vietnam films, you'll like it."

","Apocalypse Now is a poem of human nature, a reflection of what we are achieving of doing from a good vs evil perspective; its production qualities are the pinnacle of artistic achievements (good), its story and content the pinnacle of human depravity (evil).<br/><br/>Considering this is Coppola film, you just can't expect to see something poor or average, as Coppola has taught us what good filmmaking is.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is not an action movie, as many would expect considering its setting, but it needs not to have flashy action sequences or epic battles, for its flashy action sequences are translated into beautiful cinematography, and its epic battles into profound and complex dialogue.<br/><br/>The plot is without a doubt an embodiment of genius, inspiration and storytelling. The portrayal of Vietnam and its horrors, the development of its characters, the scope of its content, the essence of its dialogue, all of these things are woven together like a grandmother's sweater: impeccable.<br/><br/>Everything in this film works perfectly, which leads me to highlight the villain, the source of conflict and malice found in every minute of this masterpiece. The villain is without a doubt one of the best Hollywood has ever seen, and getting to understand his reasoning, the motivations for his actions, is truly an exercise of the mind, a questioning of how life can come falling down when one is placed in the wrong moment and place. The villain is majestic, a mad genius.<br/><br/>The production design is superb, it just feels vivid and fresh, and it never fails to be consistent throughout the entirety of the film. The cinematography just works in every shot, and the story unfolds in beautiful ways one could think could never be topped. The performance of Marlon Brando shines brightly in the few minutes of screen time he receives, and that is satisfying enough, even for so little time, and the renowned dialogue only makes everything even more satisfying.<br/><br/>I cannot find anything bad to say about this film, except the evil it represents. It is truly the best adaptation Conrad could have hoped for."

","Apocalypse Now is a 1979 Vietnam war film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall. Coppola having previously made a name for himself with The Godfather and The Godfather Part II takes us into war torn Vietnam and follows the story Captain Willard (Sheen) after he is assigned a mission to hunt down a former war hero now insane madman Colonel Walter Kurtz (Brando). Apocalypse Now in reality is a story of two halves and with many different themes throughout, the first being an insight into the horrors and brutality of Vietnam, the second a psychological journey of wits and strength to find and terminate the erratic colonel. Throughout the film we are introduced to a cast of interesting and realistic characters all affected by war in their own ways. Coppola presents his film on a grand scale with masterful visuals, stunning presentation and phenomenal special affects, with possibly one of the greatest soundtracks in film history. The Doors- The End fits the opening and closing scenes perfectly with both having similarly themed lyrics and music, as well as its beautifully haunting, primitive and climactic start, middle and end. Apocalypse Now also extends beyond a regular action-filled war movie with a huge change of pace during the middle and end of the second act, with even more interesting back stories, characters and themes. Apocalypse Now has a thrilling ending perfectly completing the picture and bringing a satisfying and conclusive end to an already spectacular film. The only flaws with the film are some relatively slow moments that do little to advance the plot and some minute comedy moments that take a way slightly from the scene and distract from the atmosphere. Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest movies of all time. 9/10"
"schroeder-gustavo","10","0","2","3 April 2016"," Apocalypse Now
","Much like The Evil Dead, a lot of the reason why I admire Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece Apocalypse Now is because of the trouble he went through to film this. Hearts of Darkness is a great documentary that tells the story of the production of Apocalypse Now and I definitely recommend it. Pretty much everything that could have gone wrong did and it's amazing that they could come up with what is now considered to be one of the greatest movies ever made.<br/><br/>Saying Apocalypse Now is a war movie is like saying Fight Club is a movie about a fight club. Sure the movie takes place during the Vietnam War and it is a very important part of the movie but it's more about the characters and the things that they go through, both psychologically and physically. In a nutshell? For me, Apocalypse Now is a movie about dehumanization because of the War, losing one's mind and, commonly agreed, a descent into madness.<br/><br/>Most of the film takes place in the river, going down to where General Kurtz is and every stop represents a part of the dehumanizing process. Example, the first stop is where Robert Duvall's character is. He is a man who loves war and the ""smell of napalm in the morning"". He takes pleasure in killing and has no morality left in that area. Another stop, where the playboy girls are, everyone loses their morality and they try to harass the women. The stop in the bridge, there is no one in charge and people are just killing. The last stop, Lance completely loses his mind and everyone there has gone insane. Our main character, played by Martin Sheen is also very damaged. The contrast between him and Kurtz is also very intriguing.<br/><br/>I don't want to talk too much about Apocalypse Now because most of what needs to be said has already been said by many critics. But it's a perfect movie, with amazing sound effects and practical effects, amazing direction, perfect and inventive cinematography, a haunting score, great characters you come to care about and amazing dialogue. It's one of my favorite movies."

","Please note, this review/guide contains references to drug and alcohol use. It is not intended as a recommendation or instruction for anybody to follow. It is just what worked for me.<br/><br/>--- I watched Apocalypse Now a number of times through my life, and while I always enjoyed it I found it slightly beyond my reach. Drug use is a (minor) theme in the movie, and I suspect a major theme in the making of it (it certainly was for at least one of the cast). I'm somewhat unusual that I started experimenting with different substances later in life, and was never really much of a philosopher, so I never really understood some of the more abstract aspects of this movie. However I finally watched Apocalypse Now and it all made sense, as much as it can. Part of that was to stop expecting it to make sense, which is an obvious metaphor for how many felt about the war itself.<br/><br/>So here's my recipe for ""getting it"". This could be unique to me and how I interpret things. It is in no way intended as an instruction or recommendation, it's just what worked for me. The following are chronological steps that can be separated by months or preferably even years.<br/><br/>Step 1: familiarise yourself with the Vietnam war. Watch movies, the likes of Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, even Hamburger Hill and some lesser known ones. Read the literature, both fiction and non-fiction. Listen to the music of the era.<br/><br/>Step 2: know what it's like to consume lots of alcohol. Note the above point where I say this is not a recommendation - health authorities will tell you this step and the following ones are bad...<br/><br/>Step 3: smoke some weed.<br/><br/>Step 4: experiment with hallucinogenics. LSD, mushrooms, mescaline, whatever floats your proverbial boat.<br/><br/>Step 5: know what it's like to question your own sanity. This step definitely isn't recommended, but chances are if you've followed the above steps you might have some idea.<br/><br/>Now revisit step 3, sit down, and watch this movie. I personally prefer the redux version but that's a matter of preference. Enjoy."

","Let me come out and say it: this is the best movie about the Vietnam War. I'd call it the Schindler's List of Vietnam, but it's possible that one of these days, they will make a better WWII movie than Schindler's List. They will never make a better Vietnam War movie than Apocalypse Now. In fact, they will likely never make a better war movie than Apocalypse Now. No film has ever described war better. Describing war is not just about describing the bombs that go off or the people whose lives are affected. If that's all there was, The Hurt Locker would be as good of a film as this is. And it's not.<br/><br/>No. Describing war involves personifying it, portraying it as an animal or a reaper or, in this film's case, a maddening plague. This movie is often described as being anti-war, but I don't think that's accurate. There are very few anti-war movies, and they are all terrible. The great war movies involve conveying the experience to the audience, and letting them feel it for themselves.<br/><br/>And there's no film that does a better job of that than Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>That is one of the all time great movie titles, by the way. The word 'apocalypse' conjures up images of a destroyed future aka Terminator or some fantastical force ruining everything, like Sauron in TLotR. But this movie doesn't concern itself with all that. It is not talking about some far off or fantastical apocalypse. It is talking about an apocalypse in the world right now, hence the name 'Apocalypse Now.' And notice that it doesn't just throw out this term; it enforces it. The napalm-drenched skies look like a war zone, yes, but they also look like harbingers of the end of the world. Think of the tone of this movie. It is hopeless and maddening and often nihilistic, just like a movie about the end of the world would be. Coppola makes the case that the Vietnam War is comparable to the end of the war in environment and mood and happenings.<br/><br/>There are two versions of this movie. There is the original cut, released in the 70's, and there is also the Redux Cut, released in 2001. The original cut is better, but not significantly so. Anyone who's already watched the film should give the Redux Cut a shot, but any newbies should stick to the original. Either way, it's a long haul. The original cut clocks in at about three hours, and the Redux is about twenty minutes longer.<br/><br/>Our main character is Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, who is sent to assassinate a rogue colonel, played famously by Marlon Brando. Madness ensues.<br/><br/>If you look closely, you can see a very young Lawrence Fishburne. He was only fourteen when he auditioned, so he lied about his age to get the role. The funny thing is, by the time this film was finished, he was almost eighteen years old.<br/><br/>Why did the movie take so long to make? Because it had one of if not the most troubled productions of all time.<br/><br/>I don't have time to list out everything that went wrong, so I'll just talk about one example. Anyone who's seen the movie knows the helicopter scene. Not a lot of people know that the music- Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries- which plays during it is supposed to evoke the Nazi army, but I digress. Those choppers had to be given back to the country from which they were borrowed- The Philippines- because they had to be used for actual war.<br/><br/>As I said, it is either to say what went right during filming than what went wrong. It's kinda like the Vietnam War, now that I think about it.<br/><br/>Most films try to either manipulate the audience's emotions or get them running. This film manages to do both. It shakes your emotions free of their coffers, then takes control of them. Every time I watch this movie, I am shaken. It is ungodly perfect."

Most of us only know by here say what that is, and almost all of it has been brought to us in film art. Some of us read, and have gotten accounts from literature. Regardless, there can be a demarcation between modern humanity and all the rest of humanity. That line might actually be moving pictures shown in a dark room,the medium of motion pictures. The human psyche has never in history been raised in consciousness as a species by a single medium, accessible to all, literate, not, ignorant, not, rich, not, in whatever language handy. Those who made, make, and control this media know it's power. Motion pictures has changed how humans relate to the world more than any other factor in our existence. Even religion has had less effect on how humans think. This is why perhaps there is a real difference in BM(before movies), and AM(yup).<br/><br/>Apocalypse is the madness AM humankind enters into when faced with war. If war is madness, being mad is the sane, natural state of a human in war. Apocalypse is this, now, now, now, totally, completely, absolutely. If you love the smell of napalm in the morning..."

","A masterpiece - one of the greatest movies ever made.<br/><br/>Vietnam, 1967. An elite soldier, Captain Willard (played by Martin Sheen), is sent on a top secret mission to ""terminate with extreme prejudice"" Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Colonel Kurtz is a US Army officer who has apparently gone insane and is fighting his own war from within Cambodia with an army of native soldiers. To find Kurtz, Willard sets off down the river on a patrol boat...<br/><br/>Searingly brilliant. As a story alone this movie is fantastic. Superb plot with some iconic scenes (eg Ride of the Valkyries), great, quotable dialogue (eg Napalm in the morning, The Horror) and some very funny lines (""Charlie don't surf!"").<br/><br/>Director Francis Ford Coppola expertly builds the tension. The movie starts off quite light-heartedly - the first third or so of the movie is quite funny, especially anything involving Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall). It is actually over-the-top funny (eg surfing in the middle of a fire fight), which might seem strange but shows you the insanity of war and soldiers at war, and prepares you for what comes later.<br/><br/>As the movie goes on it becomes much darker. Coppola slowly tightens the rope around the viewer's neck, until the intensity is suffocating. By the end you're in the middle of a nightmare, a hell on earth. This demonstrates the slow progression from balanced soldier to insane maniac.<br/><br/>So many deeper issues tackled along the way: the duality of man, good vs evil, the morality of war and why the US lost in Vietnam. <br/><br/>Excellent performances from Sheen, Brando and Duvall. Duvall received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance. Good support from a cast that includes Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford and Laurence Fishburne.<br/><br/>One thing: regarding the Redux version (the 2001 director's cut which included 43 extra minutes), its add-on scenes are of mixed value. Some are great - anything involving Colonel Kilgore / Robert Duvall is definitely a win as his character is comedy gold. Some parts of the French plantation scene are very useful, and give you a clue to where the US is going with the war and why they will lose it, but some of it feels like padding. The entire Medevac scene (with the Playboy bunnies) is unnecessary.<br/><br/>So a bit hit-and-miss. Overall the extra scenes probably enhance the movie, slightly."

","One of my favourite films. Let's get that said and done with and not drag on my personal love for it like so many reviews do. For anyone not getting the reference, the summary depicts both my love of the film, and the constant orange glow that simmers through this film. Francis Ford Coppola has created an incredible adventure of the mind, which parallels Capt. Willard physical and mental journey to find and 'terminate with extreme prejudice' Col. Kurtz. One can watch this film with many frames of mind, in which you can draw upon politics, barbarous acts, war in general, a man's state of mind, and even military family life. But putting all aside is to witness a man execute orders given to him by his superiors, with the help of a small naval crew, along a treacherous river in Vietnam. Martin Sheen should be commended more than he has been, which is difficult when he becomes overshadowed by 3 amazing performances by Brando, Duvall and Hopper. But Sheen is brilliant too. Some may not see him as a Captain who could've carried out some of the tasks he has been accredited (secretly) for, as mentioned by his superior Colonel Lucas. But it's more a state of mind that Sheen has to portray in Willard's character. Which I should say is what I believe to be the most important factor of this movie. The mind. Willard possesses the ability to achieve what none of the predecessors to his current task could. Whether or not the brilliant crossover images that Coppola uses in this film, such as the fire burning in the head of Willard near the start, are intentional, they certainly sat right with me. Coppola of course, had to overcome the overweight Brando problem and transform his movie. Boy are we glad he had to now. With the help of Brando, they created the core of this movie. Kurtz' 'demise'. Despite the lack of screen time for Brando, you feel his presence. Of course, we see pictures, and hear recordings, but we are nowhere near him. Yet you feel you get closer, and not just physically, as they travel up the river. Aside from all the war politics that come with Kurtz' new found philosophy, the words are not just all about war. I believe that the essence of this film comes from many aspects, but importantly, the dialogue, and script. As if written by Hunter S Thompson, we are taking an acid trip throughout the movie. Jumping from fear, to comedy, to brutality, to philosophy, and even to Playboy Bunnies. I, as I'm sure a lot of people are, am glad the Redux version was released. As Coppola states, it gives more of the immediacy, horror, sensuousness and surrealism of the Vietnam war. We see Coppola as a director within the movie, which shows a surrealism in itself to the act of war. Especially the Vietnam war. Despite the peace loving belief of people that all wars are unnecessary, this one may well be one the most famous wars that should never have been. A quote from the film as 'the biggest nothing in history'. A lot of morals can be gained from this film, and at many points (as a member of the military too), I see comparative instances in how the world works. For instance, the 'terminate with extreme prejudice' I mentioned earlier, is delivered by... A civilian. This then transcends to superior officers of our main character, stating the 'insanity' of the subject of this mission, but do they, or would they ever understand? They just want the problem dealt with. Governments and Military (not forgetting the vast majority of general society) find it difficult to appreciate the thought process of man when one figures out that there is more to life than politics. 'The horror... the horror'. Despite the fact that Kurtz admits his mind has drifted down river, and that he wants Willard to do what is necessary, the key link is the Photo Journalist. Hopper as mentioned earlier, plays a fantastic role in this film, and to me ties up all the aspects of this film into one. Philosophy, beauty, fear, and also drug appreciation. The latter is made obvious by his characters personality, but the others are entwined a bit tighter. The beauty aspect is the fact that he is a photographer. He wants to innocently capture the events of this war, and now especially, the incredible transfixion of Kurtz' 'putting the world to rights'. His fear is noticeable in two senses; one physically, but more intelligently, the fear that Kurtz won't be understood when all is said and done. This to me, is the nail being hammered in. Fear is all around. Willard has to end this some how. Like I had stated earlier; he has the mind-set, for both mission, and ultimately, Brando's awe-inspiring bald 'joined the SF at a strange age' Colonel. My favourite personal viewpoint, from a quote related to Willard's mind through this journey is Kurtz' question.. 'How far do you live from the river?'."

","For me War movies had always had a special place in my heart. I remember watching them as a kid and becoming so influenced by them that I would pretend to be a soldier for hours and hours. I loved the action that were in these films and they always were able to hook me. However, when I watched the Redux version of Apocalypse Now there was something different about it that made me fall in love with it by the time the credits had finally started to roll across the screen. The fact that the redux version had been almost over three hours which is something I love to see in a film. For me that says that they wanted to be able to tell the story as long as possible without having to take anything out. Instead of watching an action filled, guns shooting, bullets flying war movie like with something like Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down. What i found was instead what to me seemed liked the psychological break down of a United States soldier in Vietnam. I won't go into any more details that could possibly spoil the movie for you reading this. If there was any film that you had to see this would be it. Those last 15 minutes of the movie are without a doubt the greatest moments of the film. The music and scenery are just so beautifully done. It amazes me just the type of work that Francis Ford Coppola is able to make. And i'm glad that I finally got around to watching it."

"willcundallreview","10","0","2","21 November 2015"," Dedication pays off in a masterful way
","Masterful, precise and trippy, Apocalypse Now is one movie that only after it's over do you fully appreciate the astounding work on show. With Francis Ford Coppola in the directors chair and a cast that just seem to all mould together beautifully, there is no doubt in my mind that this movie is just purely a masterpiece. The film see's Captain Benjamin, L. Willard (Martin Sheen) who is tasked with finding out the whereabouts of a US army Colonel who has gone rogue and is apparently leading a small devout army of locals. Marlon Brando is Colonel Kurtz the man who Willard is after, but before we ever get even near Kurtz, first we go through a series of insanely bright and colourful battles, live shows, a tiger and some fantastically chosen music to accompany you as well.<br/><br/>The majority of the movie is spent on the deck of a Navy Patrol Boat led by a man only known as ""Chief"", the crew are a good mix of personalities, some miss home, some want to just get the trip over with and some just want to kill some Viet Cong. Throughout the trip down the vast networks of rivers in Vietnam, we encounter brutality and truly come to see war from two perspectives, some say this is Pro-war, and some the opposite and that for me is what makes this so perfect, it never condones or condemns, it just shows normal people in a war. The true human cost is on full show, all the way through I didn't want people to die, I know in some action movies death can seem basic and just common place, but here we see a world where you don't feel anyone really deserves for their life to be ended in such ways.<br/><br/>Coppola draws inspirations and my word do they work for him, he works this movie like a true war film should be, raw but intelligent, thunderous but ultimately horrific in equal measure. As the story goes along you just get to delve into his mind even more and what he was trying to do with each scene, for me the thing that stands out most from him directing is the rich light and textures that show not only the beautiful locations picked, but also the trippy way in which he makes you feel. Seriously after finishing this it gave me a headache but it wasn't so much because the lights hurt you're eyes no, it was the ending which really only after makes you feel kind of weird.<br/><br/>As for the cast in this we have of course as mentioned Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen, both doing undeniably great jobs in their roles respectively. Other cast members include Robert Duvall as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore whose reference to napalm is one the best and most remembered in cinema history. A young Laurence Fishburne appears on Willard's boat as the young solider from the Bronx Tyrone, whose cocky approach to the way in which war works makes Sheen's observations of the things around him even more compelling.<br/><br/>If I could recommend one film about War, then this is one I could not leave behind because it's just so damn flawless, this kind of movie is a rare thing. I think all concluding praise really has to go to Coppola for his work and tireless dedication to it, plagued by troubles throughout filming and Sheen suffering a heart attack this is one film where hard work truly applies. So all in all an unflinching look into the minds of a soldier, the darkness of fighting a battle and the way in which beautiful lands can be ravaged by war."
"luke-a-mcgowan","8","0","2","20 October 2015"," A bold audacious masterstroke that should dare Hollywood to be better than it is
","Apocalypse Now is a bold, audacious directorial masterstroke that dares Hollywood to be better than it is, and for that it deserves high praise. The movie that almost claimed the life of both Martin Sheen and Francis Ford Coppola himself is absolutely stunning to behold. If this movie came out in present day, it'd be shot almost entirely with special effects rater than on location, and not only would we have a less genuine film, we'd miss one of the greatest movie-making ordeals in the history of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Coppola and team chose to adapt Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness into a modern day setting. Let's just pause and ruminate on the novelty of that approach. Its absolutely glorious. I read Heart of Darkness a number of years ago (not very well) but I became more aware of its themes when I played Spec Ops: The Line. Seeing those themes of horror and darkness transplanted is among the boldest filmmaking projects ever brought to cinema. Vietnam may just be the best setting ever for this hellish story.<br/><br/>Coppola's direction of Vietnam is unlike anything I've ever seen. I've loved Vietnam war films like Full Metal Jacket, but not until now have I ever appreciated the horror of the fighting. As Captain Willard says, the only out for Viet Cong soldiers is death or victory, and Coppola shows us this in heavy but not heavy-handed ways. A battle over a bridge, with Americans fighting without a CO and for no reason other than that's what they do, is the most reflective. Without exposition, we know that Charlie will never stop until every American is dead. Unlike conventional wars, they aren't going to retreat to their base for the night. They have no base. Its victory or death, anything else is just procedural. As Willard and his team wind their way up the river, the glorious Oscar-winning cinematography bathes Vietnam in red, the colour of hell.<br/><br/>If there's one scene that screams masterpiece, its the dawn attack sequence. This is a masterpiece of sound, camera-work, visuals, scripting - the lot. The iconic blasting of Ride of the Valkyries while helicopters (which would have been real in 1970s!) swoop over this village and kill everything without asking questions is incredible. Helicopters explode, and bullets seem to ceaselessly rain out from the surrounding jungle. We never see where they are, and so we never let our guard down. I also have to give props to the almost sadistic death scene of Mr. Clean, with Chief sobbing over Clean's blood soaked corpse while a message from Clean's mother plays in the background. Hope has no place in hell.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen plays Willard in a very subtle performance. He flexes his physical presence enough times so we know he's a soldier to be reckoned with, but for the most part he's withdrawn and haunted. His single-minded obsession with the mission is his only defining characteristic- the war has taken all else. The rest of the cast all do solid work but by far the most unforgettable performance is Robert Duvall as Colonel Kilgore. A hard soldier if there ever was one, Kilgore subscribes to the delusions of victory and struts around like a GI Joe, ordering his men to duck whenever an explosion is imminent, but remains upright himself. His obsession with surfing is a great character trait, especially his blunt ""surf or fight"" instructions to one of Willard's men. <br/><br/>Apocalypse Now comes a bit off the rails with the introduction of Brando as Kurtz. While he cuts an imposing figure and has impeccable delivery, Brando's refusal to learn Coppola's screenplay and instead improvise all of his lines makes the Kurtz-Willard interactions a little too subjective and not nearly as engaging as the rest of the film. While Apocalypse Now never lets up its glorious look, the final half an hour or so was nowhere near as enthralling.<br/><br/>I'm very glad I watched Apocalypse Now. It deserves to be seen just to be believed. Its just short of a masterpiece, but I'm going to check out Hearts of Darkness so I can learn more about the ordeal that was the process. Just as Willard had no idea what would happen when he reached Kurtz, Coppola had no idea what would happen when he reached his end game."

","The legendary film Apocalypse Now was directed by a wonderful director F.F. Coppola in 1979. It was nominated for 8 Oscar nominations and succeeded in 2 of them. At that time it was probably one of the best pictures of the decade and today it's considered to be a masterpiece of cinematography. It's not a surprise that nowadays it's in the top 45 best films of all time.<br/><br/>The plot is setting during the Vietnam's war. The main character Cpt.Willard gets a task from military authority go to the Birma's jungle find and kill colonel Kurtz as they found his war methods unlikable. Captain gets a small boat with crew for help and they go to complete this risky and controversial mission.<br/><br/>The actors' cast is excellent. It includes many Hollywood legends whose characters are memorable and widely-drawn. Here we have a thoughtful Martin Sheen, mysterious and peculiar Marlon Brando, charismatic Robert Duvall whose phrase: ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"" became classical, crazy and weird Dennis Hooper and ambitious Harrison Ford.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is not an action movie as it suppose to be. Here the war goes background because the film's idea goes deeper to the most dangerous and dark sides of human psychology. It is also shows the war from the philosophical side. Despite it length which is more than three hours I was engaged to the events from the first shot and was not bored till the last scene. The atmosphere changes every time and it includes humour, irony, tragedy and suspense. You just can't predict what is going to happen next.<br/><br/>In addition, I want to say that music was awesome and marvelous! From the fist scene where we can hear a famous song ""This is the end"" and through the rest of movie it's perfect. Also, what is worth to be mentioned is the scene where is playing ""Ride of the Valkyries"". You'll never see something similar in any other film.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to every movie geek and to the just usual spectators. Apocalypse will keep you in tension till the end, and after watching it you would probably be sitting with an open mouth and your brain would be trying to answer the question How to stay yourself in extreme and controversial situations? If you like old movies you should watch it. If you like epics you should watch it. Don't miss a chance!"
"celestekent","9","0","2","21 September 2015"," Is this a war or politics
","As we learn going along that the anti-hero Kurtz knew what the Vietnamese war was really about and chose to position himself where he could force change. By the time Kurtz is given his new command he knew all about the lies and political compromise of the American generals and especially the politicians who ""ran"" the war.<br/><br/>Time after time Kurtz's successful actions embarrassed the powers that be, so eventually he just went off into his own little world and made war the best he could and he was just a little too good.<br/><br/>So along comes Capt Willard, ready and eager to get back into the fray. But upon reading Kurtz file, he comes to admire him, to understand him. Still his own mission must be fulfilled, what to do? Notice at the end Willard taking Kurtz's notes and other papers with him as leaves. He knows just how important they are.<br/><br/>Unlike many here who claim this movie is NOT about war, well I disagree. It is about the hypocrisy of war, and most specifically how the American politicians and generals fought that war in the public square unable or unwilling to prosecute the war as ""just war."" Sadly the US has yet to learn that lesson."

","This movie is my favorite of all time. It's not just a war movie. It just has so much to say and so much to offer of its content that every second of the movie is as intense as the rest of the three hours. Not only does it offer a great screenplay, the representation of the screenplay is flawless. Martin Sheen's character is well- developed. Even young actors who were still launching their careers, like Laurence Fishburne, did great performances. Marlon Brando's screen time is the only thing that bothers me about the whole movie, but it's just because I wanted to see more Marlon Brando in it. But the decision to keep Marlon Brando's screen time restricted to the movie's penultimate is completely understood considering how they wanted the story to end. This movie is the next in list to show Francis Coppola's directing capabilities after The Godfather. Thanks to his directing, every performance, major or minor, was spectacular. There are already close to a thousand reviews to the movie pointing out its great aspects, but I still wanted to leave a review of why enjoy this movie. I would agree on how the scenes added in the re-release weren't necessary. The overall experience of that movie is just mind-blowing."
"londonmapper","9","0","2","23 August 2015"," A Timeless Classic - Watch it with ""The Platoon""
","2 hours + long - and yet I simply could not stop watching it once I had started.<br/><br/>I had seen The Platoon before watching Apocalypse now. The latter is absolutely amazing, and one touch less hard hitting than the former, yet leaves a lot to our imagination. Actually, I watched ""the making of Apocalypse now"" before watching the actual movie, and this made me enjoy it even more.<br/><br/>I think one reason is Francis Ford manages to tell this story ""as it happened"" rather than the way The Platoon was told, in other words getting emotional. Perhaps this is consciously done, as the ""players"" of the ""war"" (or should that be ""interference?) in Vietnam seem to have gone about it all in an entirely un-emotional manner.<br/><br/>We can see repetitions of Apocalypse Now and its theme all around today too - whether it is Iraq, Afghanistan, or any other country in the Middle East that catches the fancy of Uncle Sam.<br/><br/>Keeping in mind that Josephy Conrad wrote this (US = Belgium, Vietnam = Congo) a good hundred years ago, I have a strong feeling that this movie and its theme will remain relevant for a long time to come - as long as humans behave like idiots and greedy war mongers.<br/><br/>I have added a few trivia based on the interviews of Francis Ford Coppola and his crew."

Since the first time I saw ""Apocolypse Now"" I am still awed by the opening helicopter/ceiling fan/napalm sequence.

"Samtheshrikker","9","0","3","20 July 2015"," Haunting...
","Apocalypse Now is unique among the many films depicting Vietnam. In fact, it isn't explicitly a war film. Rather, the war in Vietnam serves as context through which the much deeper, uglier themes of the human condition are exposed and analysed. <br/><br/>Martin Sheen is arguably at his best portraying Willard, a man who we see struggling at the edge of his sanity from the beginning. Sheen narrates the film with haunting tones of depression and world-weariness, and through his narration, the viewer very much experiences the film's events as Willard does. Through his eyes, we learn that war is merely a key that unlocks the inner, primordial workings of the human psyche. The picture's characters react to this in various ways, but in so doing, Francis Ford Coppola doesn't create a movie about war as much as one about the depths of the soul. Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece in this regard alone. <br/><br/>But equally reflective of this is the movie's use of symbolism and metaphor. Close viewing will reveal the light levels fading as the boat progresses further down-river, symbolising the possibility for human descent into madness and chaos. This develops until we finally meet Kurtz (the insane soldier whom Willard is sent to kill), who is shrouded almost entirely in darkness for the duration of the scenes in which he features. Marlon Brando is outstanding in his portrayal of Kurtz... he gives a truly sobering impression of a man pushed over the edge by grief, insanity and an inability to rationally process what he has witnessed during his tours. Coppola's essential climax is that of our meeting with Kurtz. This is done masterfully through the escalating events of madness encountered by Willard and his team as they progress down-river. <br/><br/>Only more poignant is the script of Apocalypse Now, which does a perfect job of exploring how each of the characters' minds and souls are affected differently by what they witness. Willard, for example, is clearly conflicted by his experience: he's so traumatised that normal life is an impossible return for him to make, and so he views war as the only drug that might keep him sane. Yet on the other hand, he admits and realises that the extent of his distress has pushed him to the brink, and that the only thing keeping him from insanity is his acceptance of war as an unbearable thing. For others, the war is a liberation of sorts through which moral restrictions and responsibility for one's actions are blurred. And for some, like Kurtz, war is a completely unhinging experience that leaves people tortured and broken by the duality present in both judgement and morals. <br/><br/>Understand this: Apocalypse Now is not an ""easy watch"". It's an extremely potent, meticulous exploration of the soul; of what it means to be human, and of how civilised human beings attempt to grapple with war's ability to unlock the primal instincts that we try so hard to repress out of daily life. Francis Ford Coppola has created a vision in which the very soul of a person is under the spotlight, and his actors are instrumental in helping him achieve this. Whether it's through this, the excellent soundtrack or the pervading use of symbolism present, viewers will be left numbed in awe by the haunting poignancy of Apocalypse Now."
"Leofwine_draca","6","0","4","3 July 2015"," Ties with The Deer Hunter and Bullet in the Head for being the darkest war movie ever
","Francis Ford Coppola's epic Vietnam story is a classic film by public definition, there's no doubt about it. Fully conveying the horrors of a useless war and the psychological effect upon the people fighting in it, this is powerful and challenging viewing. It's a beautifully shot movie and a highly influential one, helping to launch a whole Vietnam sub-genre at the time of which the Italians were extremely fond. Although if I hear that damned pretentious Coppola quote ""this film isn't about Vietnam - it IS Vietnam"" one more time I'm likely to scream!<br/><br/>The acting is very good and the actors (there are no women here) are frighteningly adept at playing insane men. Martin Sheen provides the focus piece of the movie and his deterioration into madness is so subtle that it's hard to realise that he has become deeply desensitised at the film's end until his final act of brutality. Marlon Brando is, well, Marlon Brando, thankfully on screen for only a short while as his babblings quickly become irritating (although I did like the bit about the snail on the straight razor) Cameos from Robert Duvall as a cowboy-type general and Dennis Hopper as a spaced-out photographer just add to the insanity of it all and a young Larry (now Laurence) Fishburne has the sympathetic role of a young soldier whose life is cut tragically short.<br/><br/>Aside from the realistic action sequences, this is mainly a jungle-trek film, shot on location to give it that extra real look. Fans of the Italian jungle genre would be wise to check this out, as at times this covers very similar ground. The powerful ending has Sheen and friends arriving at Kurtz's hideout to discover all manner of corpses hanging from trees and laying scattered around, with heads everywhere. Sheen's killing of the mad general is intercut with (real) footage of a bull being slaughtered in a native ritual - for me, this was sickening, and made the dying words of Brando - ""the horrors, the horrors"" seem all the more appropriate. An unforgettable film, and one that is both dark and very disturbing, although hardly an enjoyable watch."

","""Apocalypse Now"" stars Martin Sheen as U.S. intelligence officer Capt. Willard who's assigned to travel to Cambodia during the Vietnam War to terminate the demented Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz is in the midst of attempting unapproved and bloody operations in the deepest jungles lead by local tribesmen and U.S. soldiers. Willard is joined by staff members Chief (Albert Tucker), Chef (Frederic Forrest), Clean (a very young Laurence Fishburne) and Lance (Sam Bottoms). Willard teams up with loopy Lt.Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his helicopter brigade and some Playboy bunnies for entertainment purposes and a French family stubbornly not wanting to leave the premises. This leads up to an epic battle against the sadistic Kurtz.<br/><br/>After finally seeing the redux version of ""Apocalypse Now"", I can admit that it exceeded everything the shorter version of this classic film has to offer. The AFI has ranked it as one of the top film in movie history and I have no reason to argue that analogy in any way possible. It was truly an amazing masterpiece film and I am just so greatly honoured to witness one of the greatest films ever made. <br/><br/>If anyone was expecting a feel-good movie, well what the hell were you smoking? There's no feel-good elements to this film. This is the threshold to hell. The weak at heart is not invited to this party. I'm not trying to be mean, but if you can't take the brutal grimness of this movie, then it's really not for you to see. There are some comical elements, but not intended for chuckling, but for a much darker tone. Martin Sheen truly delivers as Capt. Willard a hired assassin sent on a dangerous mission to track down and kill one of his own kind named Col. Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando who was his demented best), who has now gone on the brink of dementia has developed an operation set up the deepest darkest jungles in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. One thing I don't understand is why couldn't the Army just simply sent him home via Section 8? I mean lots of Vietnam vets fell too dementia during these harsh moments. Robert Duvall as a tough, but eccentric Lt. Col. Kilgore who enjoys the aroma of Napalm in the morning. Every scene that Duvall is in he just steals every scene he's in.<br/><br/>It was very smart of Sheen to take this role, if anything, by the end of this movie, his character should have been rewarded a Silver Star or a Purple Heart or something. I mean he's aboard in a vulnerable navy boat as he crosses the jungle as he eerily gets closer to Kurtz and his insane demesne and as he draws near, I fear that Willard might be on the brink of the dark side himself. With the conditions they're up against, anyone can go bonkers Kurtz, Willard, Kilgore, anyone. You really can't rest on your laurels and say ""what will be will be."" <br/><br/>By expanding the film to an extra 49 minutes, I don't know what the story would be without the French plantation in Cambodia. I think it would be lost in the shuffle that we see these people argue over issues like politics as they exchange brandy and cigars maybe it's a ploy for Willard to have his last chance in preserving his sanity. <br/><br/>I had a chance to see it on my outdoor theatre. Just the whirling sounds of the helicopters and the explosions of the bombs sound so close to you that it could almost blow up right into your faces. This film is the perfect war movie with great acting, lots of intense scenes and a film that truly won't insult your intelligence. You're more crazier than Kurtz if you choose to neglect this movie."

Both movies tackle the Vietnam War, but Apocalypse Now travels down the into the darkness of human nature. Using the Vietnam War as a backdrop for the story, it comes out as an anti-war film. Or does it? I never feel comfortable labeling what a film is in itself, because it is all about the audience's interpretation. Please see this as my recommendation. Don't be discouraged by the dark themes, it is not glorifying violence or war in any way."

","Apocalypse Now (1979): Dir: Frances Ford Coppola / Cast: Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Frederic Forrest: Perhaps the most powerful of all war films. Director Frances Ford Coppola claimed that this film wasn't about Vietnam, it was Vietnam. At any rate, he creates a masterpiece. It is the gruelling story of an emotionally tormented Lieutenant whose mission is to ""terminate with extreme prejudice"" a Colonel who was responsible for the deaths of Vietnamese leaders. This will involve a journey by water to Cambodia where the Colonel dwells. Another achievement by Coppola who also made The Godfather and The Conversation. Martin Sheen does a tremendous job as a Lieutenant torn between the life he left and the hell he's drawn too. Marlon Brando delivers a powerful performance as the Colonel thrown between greatness and insanity. Robert Duvall plays a crazed Lieutenant who barely flinches at turmoil, and appears more interested in surfing the waves during a violent raid. Dennis Hopper plays an unstable photographer who appears completely strung up on drugs and devoid of any form of reality as he chants to Sheen about the gruesome society around him. Frederic Forrest play Chef, whose passion for cooking leads to a jungle search for mangos and an encounter with a tiger. Tremendous masterpiece about the horror that war truly is. Score: 10 / 10"

They are two movie that are closest to perfection. I cant say which aspect of this movie i think is the best, because they are all just great. The cinematography is the best I've seen in a movie so far. When you see the beautiful scenes of war or just jungle and river in Vietnam, you will know why. The fact its been shooted on Philiphines probably helps, but Coppola is the one that made it so great. The actors: unforgettable Marlon Brando as a disturbed commander Kurtz or cinema legend Martin sheen, acting is at the same level as other aspects of the film. The script is amazing too, as well as sound and colors. But the best is what this movie has to say. Just like Coppola said:""this movie isn't about Vietnam, it is Vietnam"". This is not a movie about war, if you see it as a movie about war, you should see it again because you just didn't get it. Its about people and human nature, its about madness. The book movie is based on- The Heart of Darkness- is set in Africa and river Congo, and I think that Vietnam is a much better setting. Also I think that Kurtz character is much better in movie then it is in book. If you consider yourself a movie fan, you should not miss this Coppola masterpiece."

This is something special, this plays with your mind.<br/><br/>Scene after scene, the movie keeps getting weirder, but it's such a slippery slope up until the end that you don't even realize that what you are watching is completely bizarre. From the beginning, Coppola sets the rules of the game and makes the public abide to them. And once you're deep down in the movie, there's no way out. This is not an ordinary Vietnam War movie, yet in its insanity and surrealism there's no other movie that depicts the cruelty and madness of war so well. Coppola makes no effort in trying to show a realistic Vietnam War, but because of that is that no other director has fully apprehended the meaning of war so well. To understand the traumas that war veterans go through, it is not enough with just showing a lot of cruel scenes, blood and friends and foes dying, you need to go beyond reality, you need to grasp the subconscious part of it. And Coppola does it terrificly.<br/><br/>Music deserves a special mention. A big part of the state in mind in which Coppola puts you in is because of the amazing soundtrack. I had never seen another movie with such a good use of sound effects and music in order to convey the desired message.<br/><br/>I didn't really know what to expect of this movie before seeing it. I only knew is about Vietnam. I really did not expect this movie to have the effect it had on me. Needless to say, this movie is a must- see."

","This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. <br/><br/>This movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn't at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is 'Platoon' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers."

Memorable for many lines such as Duvall's ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"". Brando's performance in this film is simply awesome. Another Coppola masterpiece which took 16 months to film.

","Apocalypse Now was made in 1979 by Francis Ford Coppola. This film takes place during the Vietnam war. Captain Willard is sent by his superiors to Cambodia for a secret mission that « does not exist ». During this undercover operation, Willard has to find and assassinate Colonel Kurtz , a highly decorated Green Beret who has gone insane during the war. Kurtz is now in the jungle in Cambodia where a local tribe worships him and obeys to his orders. Willard and his crew go up the river which will lead them to Kurtz in a US patrol boat. Along the way, they encounter several interesting characters such as Captain Kilgore who is more concerned with surfing the waves than with the death of the soldiers and the outcome of the war. This movie shows how Willard confronts the horrors of human brutality, hypocrisy and the violence of war that drove Kurtz into insanity. During the whole film, Willard details his thoughts and discovers the darkness of his own heart. Usually I am not a fan of war films. However I really liked this one, mostly because it is not only about men on a battlefield, gunshots and blood but it also focuses on the psychological consequences that war has on soldiers. <br/><br/>On top of that, I was surprised by the amount of aspects of war that are treated in this movie : the use of drugs in the US army, the mentality of destruction that Captain Kilgore embodies etc. <br/><br/>I won't forget Apocalypse Now because it delivers a reflexion about moral issues : there are not good and bad guys but men lost into the madness of war."

","During the Vietnam War, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on a confidential mission into Cambodia to terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has gone insane and commands as a god his own army.<br/><br/>For the whole movie, we follow the journey of this Captain and of his crew as they are getting closer from their goal. This is why this film is more focused on the soldiers and their feelings than on war itself. Indeed, knowing more about the everyday life of the soldiers helps us to understand the loneliness and despair they could have felt. Through Willard's understanding, we even manage to get how Kurtz, one of the army best's soldiers, has turned completely mad. However, this movie is not all dark as there are also funny (and surrealistic ?) times as when one soldier water-skis behind the boat on the Rolling Stones.<br/><br/>To conclude, I'll say that in spite of the vision of the war that this film offers and the way it is filmed made it unique and a must-see, it didn't manage to keep me interested the entire movie as there are a few really boring parts.

","Apocalypse Now is probably the most disturbing film I've ever seen. During the Vietnam war, the main character Captain Willard is given a secret mission : to kill General Kurtz who is presented as a man who became insane and actually is settled in Cambodia. Unlike other war films where the main characters are lively and dynamic, Willard is expressionless. But still, we become attached to him as he seems to be the only one not to lose his mind in this war, may be except for the end when he brutally kills Kurtz. Throughout the film, Kurtz is seen asa goal and Willard learns progressively about him as he goes up the Nung River. Little by little he wonders about the meaning of this mission. It shows how soldiers go blindness to war due to order from superior. More than that, this film shows in a general way how Americans used heavy artillery in a war where they did not have their place. For example with the famous helicopter shooting scene quite shocking because accompanied by the lively music ""Walkyries"" by R.Wagner. The music plays an important role all along the film for example putting us in a agonizing atmosphere when soldiers go crazy. I liked it when at certain times there were Rock music (The Doors, The Rollings stones). This put us in the mood of the end of the sixties. To conclude, this film sure is a masterpiece, raising the question (just like other excellent movies such as Full metal Jacket) of the psychological effects that war has on soldiers."
"tiphaine-guillet","9","0","2","15 February 2015"," A revelation
","What a complete revelation when I saw Apocalypse now! It helped me to change my opinion about the Vietnam War radically. Of course I already knew it was one of the most traumatic episodes America has ever experienced, but I could not think of such brutality in conflicts, such hypocrisy of politicians and such deteriorating effects war has on the human psyche. The plot is basically very simple and brief: Willard, an officer who has lost any hope in life and humanity, is sent on secret mission to kill the renegade colonel Kurtz, who has set up his own little society in the jungle. However, it is so much more than that: it is the Willard understanding of how Kurtz discovered the reality of war to such depth that it drove him crazy. The feature also offers philosophical analysis on war and soldiers conditions. <br/><br/>The film's beauty comes from the remarkable visual scenes, like the one where Willard goes into the forest searching mangoes and encounters a splendid tiger. It also comes from the surrealistic atmosphere which is set up since the opening scene thanks to the world-famous tune ""the end"" by the Doors. Music is indeed part of the film and enhances unreality of moments; especially when Walkyries by Wagner is played through helicopters speakers during an attack in order to ""scare the hell out of the Vietnamese"".<br/><br/>As a conclusion I would highly recommend this film to whoever is tired of meaningless brutal war movies and wants to discover how Vietnam really was. As the director film once said: ""the film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam""."

There is so much symbolism and hidden layers to everything that happens that I'm both excited to watch it again and terrified. All I can say to you is that Apocalypse Now is for two hours an extraordinary film that jumps from a fast- paced, balls-to-the-wall action film to a slow-moving war drama faster than it jumps scenes.

","This is an excellent look at the Vietnam War by Francis Ford Copolla. While this work demonstrates great content and form, it is also a window into history, as it accurately portrays the setting and actions performed during this war. The story follows Benjamin Willard into the depths of Vietnam as he searches for a colonel who has apparently gone insane. The lighting is notable in this film as Copolla makes effective use of contrast, hard, and soft lighting. The music featured in the film was also popular during the time of the films events, which adds to a more authentic quality. My favorite aspect of the film was Marlon Brando's acting as Colonel Kurtz. The viewer not only gets to witness the man's insanity, but also his intelligence and leadership skills.

Francis Ford Coppola, also known for directing ""The Godfather"", directed ""Apocalypse Now"" only a few years after the Vietnam war in which it was set. <br/><br/>Known for its vivid imagery and often weird sequences, ""Apocalypse Now"" will forever be a movie that I can always find something new to love about it. It's just one of those movies that is just so confusing that on some level it just makes perfect sense. I may not have yet achieved that level in which this movie makes sense, but for me that's absolutely okay. I honestly enjoy the fact that this is one of the most trippy, confusing movies I have ever seen. I think that's kind of the point. This movie was not supposed to be about the actual war. It was supposed to be about how crazy the emotional, mental, and physical influences of war were for the people involved. For me, this film is easily one of my favorite war movies because it explores the situation of war in a way that many other war related movies refuse to acknowledge. With the crazy editing and the vivid cinematography, I can personally say that this is probably my favorite Coppola film of all time."

At least in my opinion however, the two-and-a-half-hour-long depiction of war's atrocities is not that great when regarded simply as a film; it's much more a work of art, drastically showcasing the futility of this notorious bloodshed, resulting in millions of casualties over its duration of almost 20 years. Apocalypse Now fuels hatred and incomprehension for these happenings in the audience and makes a major pacifistic statement through the metaphorical journey of one man. But apart from the stunning cinematography, the 1979 epic lacks some cinematic traits to make it a thoroughly thrilling and rewatchable experience and can thus not get a top rating from me when regarded as a film."

","Do you have a favorite movie that you could watch over and over again? What is it about these certain movies that appeal to our senses that makes it so interesting that we could watch them a thousand times over? For me that movie is Francis Coppola's award winning war film/drama, Apocalypse Now. The vast magnitude and vivid scenery of the setting in this movie, as well as the spectacular action scenes and intense social drama plays an impactful role in making this a great film to watch.<br/><br/>The film is set during the Vietnam War and is about the troubled Captain Willard who is on his second tour of duty. He is portrayed by Martin Sheen. As the plot goes we find the Captain sent on a mission upriver on his way into Cambodia to find and kill the renegade and presumed insane U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz played by Marlon Brando. Through this ""minor task"" the movie really unfolds. We see the brutality of war. Not just a bunch of yoked up marines firing their M16's. It truly is an emotional piece on the effects of war, not just on the physical body, but also of the soul and of the mind. The story is slow to start; gradually build ups and has a very rewarding ending. Coppola does a great job in involving all major characters in this deep portrayal of men in war, struggling against an unseen enemy as well as trying to get along with those around you. Basically Coppola intended this movie to be more of a study of human behavior, compromises and confrontations, then an all out blood and guts war film.<br/><br/>This movie falls under the list of movies that drag on far too long, it was in my opinion a film that was longer than it should have been. For instance there are a few scenes where music will start eerily playing in the background and the actors will get into certain overly dramatic acting roles, the movie could have gone without these scenes. This movie is intended for the viewer to make his or her own interpretation of what the Coppola was trying to convey. This movie is intended for deep contemplation and thought, rather than for immediate satisfaction.<br/><br/>This movie was released in 1979 and although it is quite old, it remains in the top 50 best movies according to IMDb. The acting was authentic, and quite out of the ordinary at times making it all the more appealing to watch. What would one expect to see when you see names like Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, and other big Hollywood stars. The ending of this movie is simply left for viewer interpretation and just like the rest of the movie there are certain major questions that will be left unanswered. If you are the type that does not like films without the obvious happily ever after type of an ending, Apocalypse Now is probably not a good choice. But what it does offer is a deep perception, and understanding on the stark horror and reality of war."

","The opening scene depicts Martin Sheen's Captain Willard having a breakdown, drunk and covered in his own blood, wrecking his hotel room in frustration. His voice-over hints strongly at what we now recognize as PTSD, which for him manifests as an inability to readjust to civilian life. He knows he's unwell, unfit for duty even, so when the army sends a couple of fresh-faced soldiers to his room with a summons, he assumes they're there to arrest him. But no, it's an assignment. Because, as it turns out, he's the most level-headed person in the movie, and as it unfolds he seems to be the most well-adjusted Westerner in all of Vietnam. That comparison says less about him than the people he encounters as he heads upriver: Robert Duvall as a hilariously (a better adjective would be ""sickeningly"" if the tone wasn't so hyperbolic) amoral colonel, young soldiers turned feral by the loss of their commanders, and finally Colonel Kurtz, a man perhaps so unmoored by the horrors of war that he's come full circle and achieved a kind of clarity. In much the same vein as Werner Herzog's ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" (1972), which follows a conquistador's journey down the Amazon and into madness, Coppola's cameras and the atmosphere of the river work to make Willard's boat journey a disorienting, mind-altering experience. ""Apocalypse Now"" is not a critique of a futile war, at least not any more than Herzog's movie is a critique of conquistadors: it doesn't try to provide answers or even to depict reality, but to convey the feeling of becoming lost in a primeval place that makes civilized notions of identity and morality seem like quaint inventions. In other words, it is much more a ""Heart of Darkness"" adaptation than it is a Vietnam War movie, and is best enjoyed with that in mind. Visually, Coppola nails it. Misty jungles loom around the boat, grinding away at the sanity of those aboard. The camera spins and rolls, faces come in and out of view as the light waxes to spotlight brightness and fades to pitch black, and bodies are strewn everywhere like a house of horrors. The soundtrack and script are more debatable. The music of The Doors fits the atmosphere perfectly, but it's so well-known outside of the movie that it takes me out of it. At times, Sheen's voice-over narration seems overwritten, like something from Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe. ""I hardly said a word to my wife, until I said yes to a divorce,"" he deadpans at the beginning. But if ""Apocalypse Now"" is not perfect, and if the runtime of the director's cut is a bit too long, it is easily a substantial and artful enough work to reward repeat viewings."

But the big question is if the new version is all its worth or not? If it in anyway pushes forward the unprecedented legacy of the original version or diminishes it? Although, Coppola went ahead with the Redux version thinking that this is the version people will remember his magnum opus as, it certainly didn't turn out to be as planned.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now Redux, in my opinion, is quite inferior to the original 1979 version for a number of reasons. First, it slows down the entire film by a great deal. Second, it doesn't add anything that changes the overall impact of the film. And third, many of the new scenes added are boring & in some ways a little deviation from the tightly structured & meticulously edited original plot. Although, it does connect many dots that were missing in the original & many new scenes help the character development process, its 202 minutes of runtime is deeply felt.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Apocalypse Now yet then go for the original 1979 version instead of this one. Apocalypse Now Redux can exclusively be enjoyed by only the die-hard maniacs of the original film. Even after 22 years, it's clearly visible that Coppola still hasn't fully recovered from what the traumatic production of this film did to him as the creativity in the re-editing isn't that classic anymore.

It's possible to see the influence of the french film movement in Apocalypse Now!. For example, the narrative , which follows a very non-linear 'conflict' construction. You can see in various moments, specially in the Redux version, that the story is not going ahead. In fact, the only and crucial difference between a 'French New Wave' film and ""Apocalypse Now!"" Is that the latter has a definite premise, unlike the vastly majority of Novelle VaguÃ¨ films.<br/><br/>Now, talking about the film: The story itself is just fantastic. The perturbation of the men when he faces the horror is arguably the most explored subject in the film,and Sheen did a very good job portraying this kind of men. But for me, the most interesting thing in the film is that we have the protagonist, a war veteran, just watching the totally unexperienced guys becoming crazy due to the bizarre atmosphere and situations of the war. Another spectacular aspect in this film(which can't be forgotten in any means) is the cinematography. It plays a very huge part in the film. I could describe it how great and insane it looks,but no words could really explain nothing about it. It need to be seen to be believed,trust me. Apocalypse Now! is one of the most genial works in the cinema history. 10/10"

","I watched this movie for the very first time last night. However it was the Redux version, slightly longer than the original version with a few scenes that were cut from the original that were put into this.<br/><br/>What a great movie! Great acting by Martin Sheen as Captain Willard, Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Laurence Fishburne and a small but intriguing performance by the great Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>I loved the camera work and cinematography. Francis Ford Capolla really put his heart and sole into this epic and it really showed. They must have payed a fortune to finance the helicopter and aircraft and pyrotechnics in this flick.

"Robert_duder","7","0","2","2 October 2013"," Mind numbing but I have finally seen the horror
","Here is the irony of this film for me. I am a student of US History and Politics. I have studied the Vietnam war for years. I have quoted this film, talked about it with many people and yet now I am not so sure I have ever watched it until this very day. How bizarre? But it also shows just how embedded this film is into our very culture, the very definition of a classic. How many of us could poke fun or recreate a scene from this iconic film having never seen it? Now the thing is this film was either brilliant or a steaming pile of crap or something in the middle. However, after reading some other reviews I think we all feel this way. I felt like the final closing scenes of Apocalypse Now were just freaking brilliant. It had one of the most ominous, dark, disturbing, twisted ambiances I had ever seen in a film. It was really interesting to read about the incredible issues Coppola had with Brando because it ended up being breathtaking. But really the whole film is that way. It is dark and twisted and often sickening and I don't think I understand a lick of it because from square one you start to lose your own sanity and just go deeper and deeper into sheer madness. In this way the film is brilliant. Entertaining? Somehow no. I mean the film is excessive in everything and so much of it leaves you with a furrowed brow wondering what is happening.<br/><br/>You cannot deny Martin Sheen's intensity in this film. He gives a subtle, brooding and disturbing performance. His quiet, steady, deep voice narrating much of the film gives it at least most of its power. Honestly, everyone else that rides the boat with him down the ""Nang"" river left zero impression on me. I could hardly tell you the difference between them and their characters are left completely undeveloped and you just know they are there but not much else. This is especially the case when you have such terrific small cameos from iconic actors, some of whom were just starting out. Robert Duvall was brilliant at being complex, insane and basically making no sense at all but in the context of this bizarre film. He delivers one of the most iconic movie lines of all time ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning,"" and makes your eyes wide with how insane he comes across. Dennis Hopper is equally as good and disturbing as photo-journalist who clearly has lost his grip on reality. Hopper's fast talking, neuroses is really fascinating. I think the only thing I have seen Marlon Brando in are films that he small cameos in. I knew the film was leading up to him because everyone knows his infamous role in the movie. He is a powerful force on screen and certainly his charisma makes you take notice of him. I wouldn't say he was amazing in the part but somehow he has become iconic in the role and there is just something magical about his performance so he lucked out in that way.<br/><br/>I would certainly never begin to bash Francis Ford Coppola on his film making abilities. The man is a god to the film making community. There is absolutely no denying his style in this film and I would guess that every decision, every shot, every character, every odd thing you see was planned by him to make a statement. If there was ever a film I saw that literally made you feel like you were going down the rabbit hole this was it. There is imagery and metaphors and then in the same breath just in your face message about this war. The film is full of gratuitous violence and bad language and the entire thing seems chaotic. However, that only serves to prove you could study this film for decades and find new things about it or new opinions. I think I expected it to be more entertaining and more mainstream but I am not disappointed to say this is a ferociously intelligent and artistic film that I don't necessarily understand or deserve to understand. Perhaps it is a testament to its time and perhaps you need far more experience in film making to truly appreciate it. Until then I am going with my gut. It is worth seeing for those of you willing to dissect and spend two hours+ scratching your head and analyzing every detail. There is absolutely no denying its classic status. 7/10"

","Let me start by saying I only made this account so I could write a review of Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>I'm out of college now, but I remember watching this movie when I was in high school and I remember boredom and confusion and, truthfully, a lack of interest. I didn't ""get"" the movie. It was too slow. What was the point? What was the mission? Why weren't they getting on with it at a breakneck speed like in Bond or Bourne or ... you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Fast forward to college (I majored in English for the plentiful job prospects ha ha) and studied Heart of Darkness, completely forgetting about Apocalypse Now. Just as many people hate this movie or love it, many people hate the novel by Joseph Conrad or love it. It's slow going and easy to miss the point. I've learned that sometimes we just have to slow our thoughts down to match the pace of the storyteller, instead of trying to outdo him or her.<br/><br/>If you enjoy Heart of Darkness then you will enjoy this movie. Even though the era and location is completely different, this movie is almost an expansion on Heart of Darkness. You get more juicy bits of dialogue, you get to fall a little bit deeper into the crevasses of Kurtz's cracked mind. And if you're any bit a sane human being, you'll find yourself strangely comfortable with the violence and cruelty and language of the movie. You don't get the feeling that the screen is hiding anything from you and at the same time there're no morals getting stuffed down your throat. The characters on screen deal with the gruesome details of war in their own ways. Pick whom you agree with. Some you will pity, some you will find hilarious. One question the movie begs: what, in war, is right?<br/><br/>The music for this movie serves the setting excellently, at one point the bass thumping two beats like a heartbeat. Some rock and roll from the era prevails (like The Doors's ""The End""). All of it to make Martin Sheen's journey utterly foreign, exotic, yet familiar.<br/><br/>The visuals in this movie are fantastic. So vibrant and colorful, sometimes it's like a good acid trip. You don't see colors like these in movies nowadays. Watch it and you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>I don't want to say anything about the plot, but here... This movie, even though it is slow, wastes no time with dialogue. A lot of it is voice-over! If you don't pay attention, you'll miss a new development either on the mission, or on the character. (If you fail to understand the characters in this movie, then you will probably not like the movie.)<br/><br/>Watch This Movie!!<br/><br/>Slow your mind down, try to enjoy it. Give it your undivided attention. Amid all the carnage, callousness, and ruthlessness, you may find a story that is very human, and very close to your soul."

","Francis Ford Coppola directs this fascinating but very strange, unique film about Army Captain Willard(Martin Sheen, fine shell-shocked performance) who is sent ""Up River"" on a secret mission to assassinate renegade Col.

Willard encounters many strange sights and people(even among his own crew) as he tries to make sense out of the enveloping madness of this war, and his own inner demons.<br/><br/>Film is a visual marvel, and holds your attention as it unfolds its increasingly philosophical, even existentialist narrative.

","Strange, fascinating, grandiose, paranoid, overwhelming, epic, disgusting, gigantic! These are the many adjectives that can be used to describe the monument of cinema. The Redux version extended by about 45 minutes, was fully supervised by Francis Coppola for the 20th anniversary of the film and to its operation on DVD. Sequences reintegrated not distort the original about the film. We have the right to more playmates, more madness and especially more Brando, for the benefit of the character Kurtz. Only the sequence of the French plantation (30 minutes alone) is questionable digression because it has the French so naive and causes a break from the narrative. The film, supported by a director prey to megalomania, was brought forth in pain. The sets were ravaged by a storm. Helicopters lent by the army of the country where the shooting took place, were requisitioned to fight against a coup when turning the aerial sequences. Lead actor Martin Sheen, drunk all day long, had a heart attack. The director gave her tray for a whole week for a romantic extramarital under the eyes of his wife incorporated the technical team.

"silva-w-pius","9","0","1","14 August 2013"," a tale of a world teetering on the edge of Darkness
","In film it's a very rare occurrence – thus highly sort after, that a film can possess the holy trinity of a combination of a; great script, a legendary director and an almost god like actor. But such is the elusive nature of this endeavour, it never has quite has been attained in the history of film – well that's before a certain masterpiece going by the name of Apocalypse now graced our screens with this almost mythical alliance of this magnitude. The director: Francis Ford Coppola (Godfather trilogy). The story: a tale of a world teetering on the edge of Darkness almost ready to descent into primal madness, as Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) has to navigate his way through hell on earth to find and kill AWOL Col. Kurtz (The actor:) Marlon Brando (On the Waterfront and Godfather 1) - whose very name is translated into greatness in almost every language known to man. The epic tale of this coming together will probably never happen again or would even have another three components assembled that will ever parallel it. So it something to be marvelled at, as you sits down in your comfortable chair to watch such a spectacle. <br/><br/>It has been widely reported from a variety of different sources about the hardship endured by the production team. Such as shooting in a country notorious for typhoons, even at one time the place they were story the film burnt down, but luckily it remained safe, and the little fact that the main character Martin sheen was a supposed alcoholic, and would turn up on set with hangovers. All this helps to perpetuate the legend that is apocalypse now, and the irony that they were facing their own war, just at the same time they were filming it.<br/><br/>But what I love most in film, is when bold story and director hold up a mirror to society, penetrating through the shards and illusions of morality and believing that we are able to distinguish between good vs. Evil as if it was between black and white, that we like to delude ourselves with every day, but then when we enter the battlefield it seems our civilised selves gets left behind as lines get blurred. And that is what Apocalypse now does best, it blurs the line. And with lines blurred it not a surprised that the main characters go insane, pretty much anyone would, in the face of a world that turns the world you lived and knew upside down. <br/><br/>But my only criticism of film, is the focus of the film, I feel it waved far too much into the obsession of Martin Sheen's character as he tries to find Marlon Brando, when I feel that they could have taken time aside to explore the war from the perspective of the other men accompanying him on his journey, particularly Laurence Fishbuornes character who was just 17, so it would have been interesting to hear things from a black boy fighting in a white man's war.<br/><br/>It obvious my stance on the film, that I believe is must see for all, but if the first paragraph wasn't enough to persuade you into watching Apocalypse now, here is another, I would go as far as to say that Vittorio Storaro cinematography was as if watching a walking and talking Picasso piece, such was the extent of the visual art mastery he conjured up in Apocalypse Now, as if he were the offspring of Gandalf and Dumbledore. The final few scenes with Marlon Brando were simply captivating, short but sweet. Vittorio Storaro's blending of darkness and shimmers of light streaking across Brando's face was simply breathtaking, giving Brando an almost god like aura. The scene itself probably belongs hanged up on a wall in the Tate Modern as much as it deserves to be on a film screen. The benchmark for all to follow."

","Apocalypse Now is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. It depicts special operations veteran Ben Willard on a secret mission to Cambodia to kill a colonel Kurtz who is said to have gone insane. This movie is not for the squeamish. There are many civilians in Cambodia that are shot and killed and the movie shows how war corrupts morality and human decency. Willards journey as he travels through Cambodia is surreal and hellish and brought to life with great directing. It shows how war can create mass confusion on both sides.

"StoryCharts","5","0","1","19 July 2013"," War is horror
","Apocalypse Now does not make much sense to analyze with Story Charts because it's not really a movie. It's a piece of historical social commentary on the non-nonsensical nature of war by showing us a collage of scenes that outline the ridiculousness and craziness of war.<br/><br/>You can see this on the Story Chart: there is no Internal Change for anyone (Willard starts out dazed and broken, and he ends up the same way). There is no Relationship change. There is just the external quest of the mission to kill Kurtz by going up river (seems like a metaphor for some sort of mindless journey). And an illustrative tapestry of crazy scenes you find along the way.<br/><br/>The movie does not PROVE the central idea that ""War is horror"", it just shows us the effects of war. That's why to me it's not a real movie, just a series of muddled situations that is somehow supposed to mirror the craziness of war. It shows us as opposed to making us feel the central idea by seeing a tight story propelled by the choices of the characters. Sure the scenery is memorable and the situations weird and unforgettable, but so is a National Geographic article.<br/><br/>My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca"

","Apocalypse Now is an experience so weird, disturbing, and dark, I had to take a class to fully understand it. The key thing is that it's more than a mere war movie; as an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's book, Heart of Darkness, the film is a dark and primal exploration of the savagery of the human heart, and a journey into insanity.<br/><br/>Set in the Vietnam war, there are just a few combat scenes in Apocalypse Now. The beach attack in the beginning half of the film is probably the most impressive action scene, for it is well-staged and thrilling. The rest of the film, however, settles into a slower, moodier, and more trance-like pacing. Action and violence occurs sporadically, but most of the film plays out like a mesmerizing nightmare. Much like a nightmare, there are gnarly and scary things to see, but it's hard to turn away from it.<br/><br/>Therein lies the film's greatest strength: its ability to convey horror and insanity within its narrative. The story itself is all about the journey into the ""heart of darkness,"" figuratively and literally. As the characters traverse deeper into enemy territory, civilization gradually breaks down, until they reach a savage core. Thus, things become crazier, more insane, and more brutal, right up to the end. By the time you reach the end, strong themes emerge concerning savagery, the darkness of the human spirit, and morality. As a war movie, the film also harps a lot on the futility and insanity of war.<br/><br/>Even on the surface level, the story is pretty solid. The plot is pretty random, but it follows the structure of Joseph Conrad's novel pretty closely, and uses a lot of the same characters. The film treats the story and characters with diligent respect; even though it adapts a lot from the original book, it makes things fit into the Vietnam setting really well, and makes them stand out in their own unique ways. Whether you look at it as an adaptation or just another war movie, it works.<br/><br/>The filmmakers went through Hell and back to make this movie. The actual shooting went on sixteen months and went well over-budget, and in all that time, there were horrendous problems. Martin Sheen nearly died from a heart attack during filming. That scene in the beginning when he punches a mirror is not acting, and that was real blood on his hands. Marlon Brando arrived on the set totally unprepared for his role, causing even more grief. Other actors succumbed to substance abuse. Director Francis Ford Coppola lost a ton of weight during this project; later, he had an affair, which strained things even further. A typhoon destroyed some of the sets, delaying the production even further. The helicopters, which were on loan from the Filipino government, had to be withdrawn at certain times (even in the middle of shooting) to fight rebels in the area. The sheer amount of stress is palpable on-screen, and helps make it feel more real.<br/><br/>The film has splendid photography and editing. Acting is quite decent from the whole cast, and is admirable considering all they went through. Writing is good. This production uses a plethora of very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. A lot of scenes are specifically staged to reflect actual iconic events of the Vietnam war, for decent effect. Music is wild: the actual score is really funky, but the use of the Doors music and Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries is iconic.<br/><br/>There are at least two versions of this film available. The theatrical cut is a good, trim version that runs for two-and-a-half hours. The Redux edition adds on another 49 minutes: a massive wealth of new scenes, which slows things down a bit, but offers a lot more to the story and themes. There are a few scenes in the Redux version I didn't care for, but it is well worth seeing at least once. An alternate end-credits sequence was filmed (a fairly awesome scene where everything blows up), but never used for any of the film's cuts; it can be seen as a DVD or Blu-Ray special feature only.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is a sobering and mesmerizing exploration into the dark pit of mankind's primal soul. It gets pretty weird, dark, and violent, but the film is never distasteful about it. Even though it might be a hard thing to watch, in terms of its content and storytelling, it is worthwhile seeing at least once.<br/><br/>5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)"
"zepptallica","10","0","1","15 July 2013"," something special
","Apocalypse Now. The title alone is a perfect fit for this beautiful and horrifically honest portrayal of the lost effort in Vietnam. The haunting voice of Sheen, the supporting cast of Ford, Fishburne, Hopper, Duvall, Brando, and many others form the dream team of talent in front of the camera. Every scene felt like it belonged. Every speech, monologue and one liner never came off forced or felt like it had to be there.. it all needed to be there. <br/><br/>From each beautiful shot to the other, the cinematography of morning, noon, evening, and night glisten on film, adding realism in that from the moment it starts..we're attached and invested in the characters. Everything seems so organic, flowing naturally with the conversations and stories the characters passed along to each other. The experience Willard and his team go through is so unique. Deeper, more personal and ultimately more painful than any other war film in my opinion. This is an impossible story that could have easily translated as illogical or stupid on film ,was in the end masterfully crafted into a methodically paced, believable journey into darkness and truth. Coppola keeps our eyes glued to the screen, like a a great page turner that cant be put down.<br/><br/>All of Apocalypse Now's philosophical lessons, be it personal or simple bullshitting around the characters do, give this movie a depth beyond a good vs evil re-run. What I loved most of all in the end are the characters. Unforgettable moments, amazing dialog, every scene exactly where it needed to be that showed audiences things they never realized happened in the war. This is and will always be my favorite movie of all time."
"donuthaters12","10","0","1","15 July 2013"," Needs To Have The Right Mindset
","This history and production behind this film is almost just as spectacular as the film itself. Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War epic that tells the story of Captain Willard on a mission to terminate Col. Kurtz command as he has become rogue and conducting operations with the locals. This film does not focus on the exciting action part of the war but rather what the war does to a person. The film does have moments of epic destruction but it supports the point that Coppola is trying to make. To truly enjoy this film, you must come in with the right mindset or this film would be seen as a big disappointment.<br/><br/>The film is based on a novel by Joseph Conrad titled Heart of Darkness and was written for the screen by Francis Ford Coppola and John Milius. Coppola and Milius has taken Conrad's story and placed it within the Vietnam War which I thought worked. Coppola and Milius has created a screenplay that gives us a look on the horrors of war whether it's on a grand scale, like the killing of civilians, or on a personal level, Willard in his hotel room. Willard is escorted to Kurtz by a boat crew who at the start seems like normal guys in the war, just having fun and doing what they are supposed to do, but as they go further and further down the river they start to lose themselves and become more primal. The writers have not only added a straightforward story of a mission but also the disintegration of one's super-ego and has been stripped down to just the id. When they have gone past the last outpost, where every soldier seems to have gone mad, they found Kurtz. This is the point where things become less easy to tolerate as I had to watch this film at least 4 times to at least get a grasp of the point. Is Kurtz more evil or insane than any of the other soldiers napalming villages? It's really interesting how Coppola and Milius tackled this and makes us think about morality and whether or not our own super-ego is really more wiser than our own instinct.<br/><br/>The 1970's is a great decade for him, as all of his directorial efforts in that period were nominated for Best Picture and two of which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Apocalypse Now is definitely his most ambitious film as the first 3 quarters of the film just shows where most of his budget went. The napalm, ordered by Col. Kilgore, on that village was a fantastic scene and knowing that back then post production effects couldn't do something like that made the scene all the more impressive. Though this film has it's epic moments, it's the intimate scenes in the boat or at Kurtz's compound where I felt this film really shined. Too bad Coppola did not find the same acclaim in his future films, maybe except The Godfather Part 3.<br/><br/>The film was photographed by Vittorio Storaro who also did The Last Emperor, and his efforts here is just as important as Coppola's contributions as he is responsible for making the scenes look spectacular. Storaro's best captured moments in the film were at the big time war sequences, and as the film progresses it becomes more darker and moody. On daytime scenes, the image gives off a sunrise or sunset kind of feel to it which I think worked for the film. I like the way Brando was captured, consumed by the darkness making it feel artful.<br/><br/>Carmine Coppola is the composer for this film. The film's score sounds like something that came off either from A Clockwork Orange or The Shining, using some sort of synthesizer to manipulate the sound in order to create that tension in the track. I don't think it was that much of a standout but it does work. What did standout was the soundtrack, they come in full force. Moments like the helicopter scenes using Ride of the Valkyries or that scene on the boat where The Rolling Stone's 'I Can't Get No Satisfaction"" was playing through Clean's radio. Coppola's score is more present as they go down the river and pop songs that were found in the first track were gone. Also this film is loud, this was one of the first films to ever have a 5.1 mix and the results are booming.<br/><br/>The acting is on this film is great. I especially like the subtle things that are found on the boat ride that makes the scene just a little more realistic and gives a little more personality to the characters. Willard, for the most part, doesn't try to outshine anybody but rather just keeping it simple. There is a scene though in his hotel room where you can really feel the damage of Willard and it's one of the moments that really stand out in Sheen's acting. I'm not even sure he was acting because he was an alcoholic then. Brando didn't wow me like he did in The Godfather but he was poetic and artful in his acting. He was consumed in Darkness for the most of the film so most of his acting came from his facial expression. I preferred him here than he was in The Godfather. Dennis Hopper as the photojournalist was the one where I never really understood because it felt like his lines were improvised and was talking in code, but it was still somewhat relevant to the plot.<br/><br/>This film is something that grew on me with multiple viewings. This is up there with my Coppola favorites and at par with The Conversation, which I think is his best work. This film is deep and doesn't try to wow you but rather have you thinking. Just try to make sure you watch this with the right mindset to truly enjoy this film."

","I saw the Redux version. I saw it and I thought it was one of the most thought provoking, yet disturbing depictions of not only war, but life. I will never see it again, because the effect is permanent. I had very high expectations for it. Not only because it is revered as one of the greatest films of all time, but because in this case: it's the director's cut. A whole hour of released footage, all packed into it. I have to say that the majority of it, it had an impact, even though some people viewed the original one as better, it had an impact. The opening scene is one of the most powerful openings in movie history, all the destruction, all the damage that we did in that country is beautifully depicted. Robert Duvall is definitely one of the major highlights of the movie, the reckless lieutenant colonel Kilgore, his performance is haunting, in the way of a man who was made for war, a man that lives and breathes death and destruction. His appearance is brief, but his effect is permanent. Martin Sheen gives a very nuanced, calm performance as the film's protagonist, the man that doesn't know what he's fighting for, which in itself is very a very compelling subject. And last but not least, Marlon Brando, makes colonel Kurtz one of the most compelling characters of all time (in my book), Kurtz is a world weary, manipulative and insane fascist. But at the same time, he knows his problems and he knows them well. That's what's compelling. But in the end, this is a war film best left for interpretation. I thought it was a well-made, staggeringly powerful, work of cinema."
"bakerr02","5","0","1","20 June 2013"," Apocalypse Now: My Review
","The film Apocalypse Now, directed by Francis Ford Coppola tells the story of a Captain in the United States Army that has been given a classified assignment to terminate (with extreme prejudice) a Colonel that has gone rogue. The film is driven by Martin Sheen playing the above Captain Willard who in attempting to carry out his orders gives the audience a front row seat to what the landscape of Vietnam had been like for the souls that were a part of the conflict. Supporting Sheen in the movie was Marlon Brando, an eccentric Dennis Hopper, a young Lawrence Fishburne, and Robert Duvall (who provided the often quoted line ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning!""). There was also a brief role in the beginning of the film by Harrison Ford whose name in the film is homage to George Lucas who helped with the script of the film. <br/><br/>The theme of the film focuses on the horrors of war and how conflicts can change a person, from how they think to how they behave. As many other films have shown in terms of warfare (Platoon, Black Hawk Down, and Brothers, among others) the reasons for the fighting is sometimes not cut and dry and the results or aftermath of what soldiers experience can certainly change them. Without spoiling the movie there are many instances in which the stress of fighting affects all of the characters and how they go about trying to continue on with their mission. Sheen's performance in this regard is also worth noting as through the journey of his character the ethicalness and understanding of the person he had been assigned to kill makes him question the leadership with the Army is the best, and maybe more to the point whether the conflict that they are waging so far from home is worth it. The theme however carries over throughout the film in terms of how the film was shot and the lighting being effectively utilized. Throughout the film there is darkness, shadows that hint at the conflict that the characters are engaging in and how they are shooting upon enemies that they cannot see.<br/><br/>The theme is also driven home through an effective soundtrack that heightens some of the most dramatic scenes in the film and also reinforces how the war and his previous assignments affected Willard and led to an internal debate over if he should actually fulfill his orders. Further the theme is central to the climax of the film as Willard ultimately carries out his mission terminating Colonel Kurtz (Brando), with Kurtz's final words being ""The horrorthe horror"". These words seem to speak to Willard's character as he leaves Kurtz and begins to make his way to his boat he had arrived on. Throughout the scene Willard maintains a distant look, a far away glance that through his journey and everything that he had experienced up to that point he had lost something that made him human, which was his soul and yet he still relinquished it to carry out orders given to him.<br/><br/>As the film fades to black, Kurtz final words are repeated as Willard and Kurtz's faces are visible on screen. The image of the two men seems to symbolize that the men are perhaps more similar than Willard would've initially wanted to believe or could hope to understand which is perhaps another horror of war, when the assignment is to kill someone that is just like yourself."

","What can I say that hasn't already been said? An epic masterpiece that captures the true insanity of war. Francis Ford Coppola's films dominated the 70's. The trouble with the making of this film has been well documented. As they say 'There is no true beauty without decay.' There are powerhouse performances from Sheen, Duvall and Brando. I think the sound and narration are perfect. I can't think of a film where a narrator has blended the story so seamlessly. The music by The Doors with the surroundings capture something truly special. It offers something different from the standard war movie. The sense of disillusionment and detachment from the war itself really stands out."

","I think this movie did a decent portrayal of the ugliness of war. Not only did it show the brutality of it, but it also showed how unseriously and irreverently some of the combatants took it, especially the American soldiers. Especially good was the showing of the blatant disregard of life of the Vietnamese - lives that the American soldiers seemed to deem worthless or at the very least of much lower value.<br/><br/>The narration was good and done well in a noir-commentary type style.<br/><br/>The only issue I had was of the ending. I don't feel Brando in reality would have let himself be killed so easily after establishing such an empire and army. This part was a bit unbelievable.<br/><br/>Other than this, a pretty good movie."

","Apocalypse Now and the Redux version are in my opinion Coppola's most memorable films because they pack more into one film than his entire Godfather trilogy. It features possibly Brando's best performance as the almost god like Colonel Kurtz who despite not appearing in the first half has a powerful presence throughout. Duvall's performance as Kilgore is also noteworthy for summing up the insanity of war in one character better than some films. But it is Sheen's narration that hold the epic together as his character just like the viewer attempts to understand the madness and senseless destruction happening all around him. The connection between him and the viewer is only increased in the Redux version making the character more approachable.<br/><br/>While it may not be the most realistic Vietnam war film it immerses you into the war with visually stunning images like no other. The fact that the war is sidetracked by Willard's hunt for the American Kurtz demonstrates how who the enemy is was never clear in Vietnam"

","Apocalypse Now is a Vietnam War masterpiece by Francis Ford Coppola.<br/><br/>The good. This is an other one of those movie you could list everything here. Once again, I'll just mention what makes it special. The impeccable photography, the viscerally poignant visuals, and the incredible score perfectly emphasize the dark chilling gloom of the situation, the sense of impending doom. The story is a solid tale that exposes the twisted nature of the conflict. The long and slow scenario really lets you sink into the morass faced by the main character, like feeling a centipede crawl across your skin. Unexpected events popup all the time.<br/><br/>The actors. Martin Sheen shines and quietly shows his talent as the tortured special force soldier sent on a mission of a lifetime. Robert Duvall is the perfect blustery unshakable commander. Marlon Brando displays all his talent as he portrays a genius commander gone mad. An extremely young and unrecognizable Laurence Fishburne already shows us his potential. And finally, Harrison Ford, fresh from Star Wars, plays a small role as a colonel.<br/><br/>The bad. Nothing.<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. A difficult movie to watch, but a must for anyone with enough fortitude. The redux version should be seen to really understand the whole story.

"Sonic_Ocean","10","0","2","16 May 2013"," The End
","With a movie like Apocalypse Now, the ambiguity in its approach may be offsetting to some, but in my opinion, when a story is ambiguous and the lines are blurred on who is the 'good guy' and the 'bad guy,' I feel a stronger human connection to the story and the characters, despite their flaws in morality, because that is what real life is truly like. It's not necessarily about letting the so-called 'good' triumph over 'evil.' Sometimes, the main question is is it even necessary? Perhaps, sometimes we are no different from the villains.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, Apocalypse Now is a story about our human psyche and how it can easily become corrupted by the tragedy of violence. Whether our spirits can become pure again is a question to ponder. And how these points are born from the story being told shows that Apocalypse Now is more than just about war, but about our war with our own humanity. Whether it means to do the right thing or to find some sort of redemption from the wrongdoings of our past, we are all searching for something just like Willard traveling down the Nung River.<br/><br/>As we keep searching, will it take us to our breaking point? Will it kill us or will we rise above it and reach that destination we have been searching our whole lives for? These are only a few of the questions that this film has brought to my attention and I assume many who watch this film will pick up something different from it, as the story is wide open to many different interpretations.<br/><br/>With its heavy hallucinogenic atmosphere, Apocalypse Now seems to evoke a very spiritual feel. It's cinematography shows the beauty of nature being contrasted with the ugliness of man-made destruction. The scenes where it's tranquil and slow really immerse you into the movie and as the movie becomes more despondent in its tone, the use of chiaroscuro becomes more evident. I cannot find the right words to do justice as to how much this film is a beautiful piece of art, not only in its story and its characters, but also in its visual aesthetics.<br/><br/>To sum things up to the point, 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that differs from many straight-forward Hollywood movies, in that one can develop many conclusions, due to its very subtle nature in its story. It may sound like a simple story at first, but upon multiple viewings, you will find there are many layers beneath the surface. Apocalypse Now is more than just about Captain Willard trying to accomplish his assigned mission, but also about him questioning what HIS real mission really is underneath it all. It will make you, the viewer question that just as much as I question what my own objective in life is and whether it is even attainable. Philosophical ramblings aside, 'Apocalypse Now' is a stone cold classic and it is one of the best movies of all time."
"phbasketball6","10","0","1","5 May 2013"," Greatest War Film of All-Time
","Best war film and the best of 1979. Even the filming of Apocalypse Now was a war with the many production problems it had. Francis Ford first asked Roger Corman for his opinion on shooting at the Philippines with Corman responding, ""Don't Go."" At first the film starred Harvey Keitel but due to arguments with Coppola he was fired. Then Martin Sheen was hired for the part and later on had a massive heart-attack. A typhoon also ruined the film's production and set them behind schedule. Also Marlon Brando arrived at the set late to admit that he never read the ""Heart of Darkness"" and was overweight. Coppola even threatened suicide a couple of times and lost 100 pounds while filming. Even though Apocalypse Now had many production issues, Coppola didn't give up and made it which turned out to be one of the greatest movies ever.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie starts off with Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) being drunk and troubled. He is assigned to find Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has gone AWOL. Willard is told that Kurtz has gone insane and is commanding a group of his own Montagnard troops. He is also told to terminate with extreme prejudice. Willard and his crew take off in the search of Kurtz and encounter many things on the way.<br/><br/>This film shows the glory yet sadistic side of war with the Robert Duvall part playing ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" in the helicopter scene, forcing people to surf, and giving his speech stating that he wishes that war never ends. It also shows the mentally endorsed pain that the war can give you with the Marlon Brando part.<br/><br/>The direction was amazing by Coppola; it's his best work besides The Godfather films. Coppola did an outstanding job filming a bloated Brando to make him seem stronger and thinner by avoiding his belly, making him wear black and filming him in the shadows. The cinematography was also at an all-time best especially at the night scenes.<br/><br/>The screenplay was amazing and the ending had a good twist to it. The acting by Sheen, Brando, Duvall, a young Fishburne, Hopper, Forrest, and Glenn was amazing. This film made Martin Sheen a notable actor, was one of Duvall's best performances and started Fishburne's acting career."
"raphaklopper","10","0","1","16 April 2013"," What can I say about this film?? Brutally INSANE!
","Coppola already showed us his vision of the American Mafia in ""The Godfather"" (family and honor above the business), now in ""Apocalypse Now"" he show's his vision of the Vietnam War (pure insanity). This leads to the problem of how can I even begin to comment on the film. Comment technical aspects, the performances; the superb script, everything is so PERFECT!<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director, but he is a total genius on writing as he was as a director, I said ""was"" in the past, because while making this film his seems to have exhausted all creative brain cells in his head (compared with the films he does today), but the sacrifice was worth it. We have a script that is so insane and disturbing as it is on screen, but the involvement of Coppola on the script injected a narrative that reflects exactly the war.<br/><br/>The story is set during the Vietnam War, when Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on a dangerous mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade colonel (Marlon Brando) who defined himself as a God among a local tribe. During this journey we see the spectacle that Coppola planned from the beginning, we see a little of everything War; Adventure; Sex; Partnership, a bit of humor, all coated in a script and scenario that are simply spectacular, and as I said before, INSANE.<br/><br/>When Coppola says: ""This film is not about Vietnam - is Vietnam"" he's right. What began as a patriotic war to defeat Communist aggression, changed America's view of the world and of himself and world view of America is the beauty of the folly of Apocalypse Now, which makes it a masterpiece of film and says more in its running time on the brutality of the conflict and hypocrisy of politicians. ""Apocalypse Now"" is the ""Insane Masterpiece"" of cinema!"

","I never thought I'd ever use the word ""Beautiful"" to define a movie, especially not one that dealt with the combat of Vietnam. But this movie truly is Beautiful. The colors in this movie are just so vivid and mesmerizing, that when combined with the mood the story gives, you feel like you're on the same drugs the Director Coppola was on.I don't do drugs by the way, the movie is just so good at captivating and transplanting you that you get in that mood while watching it. My rating for this movie is actually a 9.5 and that is just because it does not include any crazy unexpected twists, or any interesting philosophical themes like every other of my Favorite movies, but I guess that the lack thereof is just a testament to Coppola's directorial capabilities(I'm not a Godfather fan by the way, I liked the first one but I did not love it).

","Apocalypse Now was definitely a lot different from what I was expecting from it. I had expected a war movie, with loads of blasts adorning it. Some sort of a battle that would eventually lead to the apocalypse or even the onset of a new species or some sort of an alien race. Obviously, that was not to be but thankfully, I was not disappointed with the movie. Some things that struck me deeply were the use of 'The End' by the doors, Marlon Brando's short yet impactful performance and a genuine portrayal of the emotions associated with the war, most notably by Kurtz's ""The horror, the horror"".<br/><br/>The build up till the part when their boat enters Kurtz's territory is brilliant. That is followed by some scenes involving the locals that are quite thrilling. Their depiction as them being aghast, dazed and in a state of trance was creepy at times. The end of the movie with the Doors song and the two concurrent slaughters is also quite impactful. In between are spread the usual Vietnam war content that one sees in all the movies. Noobs being sent to Vietnam and not knowing what they're doing there, unnecessary deaths in the process, Locals being killed for no reason but to assert military authority over some specific part. What ""The Deer Hunter"" explored, Apocalypse Now went deeper and presented it more as a psychedelic experience. Use of music in the movie is a distinguishing feature: The End, Ride of the Valkyries, Satisfaction all used quite effectively."

","GOD BLESS America AND GOD BLESS ""APOCALYPSE NOW""! ""Apocalypse Now"" by the legendary, Oscar-winning Francis Ford Coppola is the best depiction of the Vietnam War. It is pretty obvious onto how a dedicated soldier could meet his ""breaking point"" at that time. Honestly, being in Vietnam, fighting the Communists, and experiencing torture for 21 years is brainwashing. There is a tremendous amount of symbolism toward the famous lines in the film, which are ""The Horror. The Horror."" and ""Terminate with extreme prejudice."" Yes, ""Horror"" has a face. But it does not need a friend because it is ""Horror"". Kurtz is seen as a god because he is a friend of ""Horror"". Very respectfully, Willard is mainly the only man in the war to not have the same downfall as Kurtz's and the other soldiers', may they rest in peace. ""Extreme Prejudice"" is self-explanatory, but it means much more than killing an insane traitor. Although America went out to give Vietnam a helping hand, specifically the Southern Government, there is ""Extreme Prejudice"" towards an American who becomes close with Vietnam. Except, Kurtz became WAY TOO CLOSE with ""Horror"" and even a god with a ton of clever morals in ""lIFe"". That is why Willard must ""Terminate Kurtz with extreme prejudice."" Even though a Frenchman said that the Vietnam War is ""the biggest nothing"" in American History, the Vietnam War is not ""the biggest nothing"" in American History because A. the man is French and B. there were plenty amounts of American casualties in the war. Personally, I am a Mexican American and 17 years old, but very patriotic. Other than WWI and WWII, I would enlist in the Vietnam War. Hopefully, if I ever become a doctor and WWIII breaks out, you can definitely, without a doubt, count me in. Reason being, there is no greater feeling than serving for a cooperative, great, and respectful nation. Lastly, I sure do hope that this world does not end in the way the photojournalist said it would, which is for everyone killing each other. GOD BLESS America AND GOD BLESS ""APOCALYPSE NOW""!"

","Francis Ford Coppola knew exactly what message he wanted to send with this film and he nailed it perfectly. He captured the inhumanity of war and the whole thing echoes of evil. We are shown into the mind of Captain Willard in the opening scene. Which is as nightmarish as the war around him. His crew can be summed up into the stereotypes that are found in war, from the pacifist chef who never wanted to join to the drugged out Lance. They show us the alternative views on the war and on their mission. <br/><br/>Most people seem to lose interest as the film progresses due to the film slowing down as Willard's idiosyncrasy is manipulated by the environment. After watching both the cinematic and director's cut, the cinematic one, to me, is the superior. I found myself getting tired in the director's cut as certain scenes seemed to drag on beyond their use. <br/><br/>Overall the film is an enthralling and intense message, and it sets the bar higher than any war film released after it can reach."

","I saw Apocalypse Now almost two years ago, before I really got into film. I had previously seen Saving Private Ryan, and loved and respected it. I was in disbelief it wasn't the #1 rated war film on this website, so I sought out Apocalypse Now. <br/><br/>I hated it. I hated Apocalypse Now so much. It wasn't boring, and cheesy, or even pretentious- it was just wrong. But over the next few months, something changed, and it really grew on me. And it grew. And eventually I realized: I loved Apocalypse Now. I bought it on Blu Ray, the tremendous 'Full Disclosure', and just saw it again because one of my classes is studying Heart of Darkness.<br/><br/>I was right. <br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is more than just the greatest war film ever, it is one of the greatest films ever, period. A tower of cinema, an achievement in both the technical and artistic fields.<br/><br/>In the Vietnam War, parallelling Conrad's original ideas in Head of Darkness, Cpt. Willard returns to Vietnam and is given an assignment to kill Colonel Kurtz, American war hero. But after the first act, the war is really stripped from the film. Context is established. It's bigger than that.<br/><br/>From start to finish every aspect of Apocalypse Now aims for absolute perfection. The opening montage mixes helicopters, Willard's hotel nightmare, and The Doors. Not The Beatles, not the Stones, but the Doors' raw, controversial track, The End. We learn who Willard is, and over a really unnerving tape, about who Kurtz is. Or may be. There are beautiful shots of vast forests and mountains, more intimate walks through the jungle and of the river, brilliant lighting of characters, horrifyingly beautiful sets with hanging bodies, ancient ruins and bizarre alters. The sound quality is without a doubt the greatest in film. Apocalypse Now is more than a film with a plot and an idea, it's an experience. No credits, no titles. Nothing to distract.<br/><br/>And in the end, what does it come to? Knowledge, perspective, accidental strength from the weakness of others. What, where is freedom? It isn't spelt out exactly what the intent is, but there are several, and having knowledge of the source material is a huge help.<br/><br/>A second chance is one of the biggest rewards I'v ever given myself.

Although I have not seen the regular version, I found this version far to long, and assume the regular version cuts out much of the pointless extra scenes that were in this version.<br/><br/>However on a lighter note I felt the team that the viewer would relate too were portrayed well and the fact that each of them were sufficiently different so that there expansions into madness were so much more diverse and relatable to the viewer, whether you were a Lance character who completely became mad, or a Martin Sheen character who semi became involved in the madness, everyone became mad, and that is the power of the jungle.<br/><br/>The cyclical nature of this film shows how it is all one big cycle in the jungle and is completely separate to real, life and that is what appears to be the main message of the story, whether its the strange French plantation the team encounter or the idea that the target has separated himself from real life, and that there is nothing for these men once they return home from war, and they almost want the jungle to kill them. <br/><br/>The other main negative about this film is that the viewer actually saw very little of the war at hand and all the main characters who died, died in between locations and so their deaths were seen as insignificant in a way. <br/><br/>I could go on for days analysing this film but all in all it was a good story spread out over a period of time that was far to long, supposedly giving the viewer a feel for the history of the moment and what the people went through (similar to Schindler's List) Because of the fact this film was elongated it cannot be seen as a truly good film despite its amazing story. <br/><br/>Good but FAR to long."
"estebangonzalez10","7","0","1","25 July 2012"," Robert Duvall is the highlight of this film
","¨I love the smell of napalm in the morning.¨<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Apocalypse Now will be considered by many as one of the best films of all time because it is a very memorable and unique film. It feels surreal at times and has some great performances. It's also hard to define what genre the film belongs to because it doesn't seem to have a structure or a pattern we find in other films. Apocalypse Now is a classic and powerful film, but I really wasn't blown away by it and didn't enjoy it very much. The problem I had with it was that I watched the Redux version which is almost one hour longer than the original, so there were several moments that seemed to drag forever. What I did enjoy about this movie was the first hour which I felt was an absolute masterpiece. Those first sixty minutes were a lot of fun and had the best moments in the movie. Then the next two hours dragged way too much with all the surrealism. I got the point, the soldiers were getting crazy over the minute and the film succeeds tremendously in pointing that out as we see how nonsensical this war really was. The minds of these men seemed to be lost completely and there was chaos reigning all over the place. For me nothing will replace those brilliant first sixty minutes with a performance from Robert Duvall for the ages. He was perfect in those few scenes he was in and I wish the film would've dealt with him instead. The entrance in the helicopters with the classical music and then the surfing in the middle of the war zone was so hilarious; one of the best scenes in film history. I was really feeling good about this movie, until the film went completely in another direction and lost my interest.<br/><br/>The movie takes place during the Vietnam War and it begins with a voice over narration of the main character, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen), who has recently returned from the United States to continue fighting. He is beginning to lose his mind while he awaits his mission. He says all he wanted to do when he was in the jungle was return home, and once he was home all he wanted was to return to the jungle. War has taken its toll on him. Finally he receives a new mission from Colonel Lucas (Harrison Ford) that is highly classified. He has to go down the Nung River all the way to Cambodia and find a former Colonel who has seemed to have lost his mind and gone haywire. He has built an army of his own and is killing off several Viet Cong officials without taking orders from anyone. Colonel Lucas wants Captain Willard to locate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) and kill him. Willard is sent on his mission along with a Navy patrol boat to escort him. Chief Phillips (Albert Hall), Chef Hicks (Frederic Forrest), Lance Johnson (Sam Bottoms) a known surfer, and Clean Miller (Laurence Fishburne) are Captain Willard's only companions on this classified mission. In order to begin their course down the river they first have to infiltrate a Viet Cong outpost so Lt. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his cavalry help them do so. As Captain Willard and his men begin their descent through the river they come across several bases (friendly and enemy) and the further down we go the more chaotic and wild things begin to get.<br/><br/>The descent through the Nung River was probably my least favorite part of the film. I enjoyed much more the scenes with Lt. Kilgore and his men that helped them begin their mission. Duvall as Lt. Kilgore steals the movie and he is brilliant in every scene. He is more concerned with surfing than he is with the actual War. It's as if he is living in an alternate reality. This is just a small glimpse of what we are going to see further on in the movie as we encounter different outposts that seem to get weirder every time. Everything is escalating up to the very end and seems to get more and more chaotic thus making the title, Apocalypse Now, very appropriate. This isn't your typical war movie, people are losing their minds and the film becomes more and more surreal and harder to fit into one specific genre. Francis Ford Coppola was at the top of his game during the 70's with The Godfather films and you can see how brilliantly directed the scenes were. The cinematography and lighting was excellent. The reason I don't give this film a higher grade despite admitting it is a memorable and unique movie is because I really wasn't entertained that much with it. It would be hard to watch it again, unless I could just see that first hour with Robert Duvall. The all star cast makes it a little easier to watch: Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Harrison Ford, and Laurence Fishburne. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

Each sequence contains a beautifully contrasts of colors with continues beautiful set pieces which enormously contributes to the film surrealistic and physcological mood. There are three particular sequences that display this brilliantly, first the opening sequence with the slight noise of the helicopters and explosions inter-wined with 'the end' establishes the mood like no other, the 'Ride of the Valkyries' attack is simply one of the best battle sequences committed to celluloid and the 'do long bridge' conveys a surrealistic nightmare.<br/><br/>The characters also contribute to the films mood and atmosphere. At first we are introduced to Willard who is already mental unstable however the other individuals that occupy Willard through the river seem quite normal at first until they slowly descend deeper into the clutches of the jungle, as the river works brilliantly at metaphorically representing the decent into madness.<br/><br/>Like many masterpeices, 'Apocalpyse now' will withstand the clutches of the time because it's a film that gives your more than just an exercise in watching but creates an authentic and surrealistic expericence like no other film I have seen before.<br/><br/>'Apocalpyse now' is filmmaking at it's best."

Willard meets an absolutely eclectic cast along the way, none more so than Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore, a cowboy that orders his squad to surf in the middle of a firefight before letting out ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning!"" as he fries a plantation.<br/><br/>The deeper our foursome get into enemy territory, the deeper they sink into mistrust, insanity and hair-trigger violence. They are briefly saved by a USO show featuring Playboy bunnies but ultimately collapse well before meeting Kurtz. An unneeded boarding of a civilian boat ends with its crew dead and a small puppy adopted by Lance as the only survivor. Willard shoots the last passenger, a middle-aged woman, with the warning he told them not to stop. As the trek deeper they lose two crew members to native arrows and when they find Kurtz's tribe only Chef, Lance and Willard remain. Chef is ordered to call an airstrike if Willard doesn't return by 22:00 but he'll never have that chance as Kurtz has his head delivered to a captive Willard later on.<br/><br/>The final segment, while otherwise strong, is ruined by an overwrought Dennis Hopper and his flaky hippie mantras. If they had cut a few of these scenes and focused more on the natives and their feelings on Kurtz, the movie might have gained...Kurtz himself is now a pseudo-philosopher mixing The Golden Bough with The Bible and his army know-how to hold the tribe captive. No one attempts anything since Kurtz has so much charisma (think Jim Jones) that his word is law. Willard does eventually dispose of him and the words ""The horror! The horror!"" echo from Kurtz's mouth as Willard parts the tribe and return to the boat, his face in native paint and irrevocably changed. We know when he closes the radio comm that this is the end for him and Lance, they will either become the new lords or will end up dead. Unfortunately, their minds and hearts are broken beyond repair.<br/><br/>Is this an accurate depiction of the Vietman war? Couldn't tell you. Coppola said it was and in either case, this is essential viewing for anyone that wants to witness the internal changes of combatants, especially in the oppressive confines of Vietnam's jungles."

"janecamacho","9","0","1","5 May 2012"," A long journey through the gates of hell.
","I saw the redux version of Apocalypse now the day before yesterday and it's stuck in my mind since. I had already seen it, nevertheless the experience of watching it again was (as it always is) very refreshing! It's like admiring a painting by Michelangelo or DaVinci for a second time and being mesmerized by every detail, every color, every line.<br/><br/>For a bit of plot summary, the movie follows captain Willard (Sheen) who during the Vietnam war is given the mission of killing a highly decorate Colonel, Kurtz (Brando). Kurtz has retrieved deep within the Cambodjian forest, exercising his command without any restrains and leading a group of native followers who constitute ""his"" army. So Willard must pick up his track and get to him by hitchhiking a ride with a patrol boat crew up the river and into the heart of the forest, or more fittingly into the heart of darkness.<br/><br/>This movie should not be viewed as a docudrama from the GI's point of view, shedding some light on the horrors of the War in Vietnam, or of war in general. Apocalypse now is more of a soul searching experience within a war background, a war whose worse aspects provide the elements needed to create the canvas in which the story evolves. If I'm allowed to indulge in some free interpretation, the movie is an exercise on the worst side within the human psyche, its darkest side, and the path leading to it, a path that Sheen's character is forced to pursue as he searches for Kurtz. As he begins to understand him he also starts to get closer to that darkness within him. So the whole journey up the river can be understood as an allegory for a journey into the soul, into that dark side where Kurtz supposedly has reached and which is very well suggested in the narrative by his encroaching in the heart of the jungle. As a matter of fact there are enough suggestions and key moments in the movie to support this (possible) interpretation. It's as if John Millius and Francis Ford Coppola tried to adapt Joseph Conrad's book (""The heart of darkness""), as a kind of Dante's Inferno blended in the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>But this abstract and stylistic journey isn't brought fourth by merit of the script alone. The visual style, the editing, the score, all contribute to this complex canvas as I called it: Vittorio Storaro's cinematography alternates between a pale daylight and the dark night photography, sprinkled with only a few bright lights giving a sense of otherworldly atmosphere to the whole movie. That along with Carmine Coppola's eerie score ultimately emphasizes Willard's psychedelic journey.<br/><br/>I must say that although I haven't seen the original version for over ten years, I think the redux version is better. The biggest throwback in this version might be the French plantation scene in which Coppola indulges in considerations about colonialism and patriotism. And although its subject is not devoid of merit (or mishandled for that matter), the fact is that this scene completely stops the movie just as Willard's journey is near the end. However the scene itself can be appreciated for its worth as it doesn't play down all the other inserts in the movie which add a little more depth in secondary characters (like Willards boat companions) alluding to the fact that they too join Willard in his human hellish descent.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be fare to go without mentioning the acting: the trio Sheen, Brando and Duvall stand out! Martin Sheen is very convincing, as a man that doesn't fit in society. A soldier aware of his terrible part in the war and a perfect Dantesque character for the journey ahead; Brando and Duvall impersonate the characters already gone that far ""up the river"", which highlights the hypocrisy of the generals who condemn Kurtz yet condone Colonel Kilgore's (Duvall) equally unsound warfare. As for Marlon Brando well, he always distinguished himself portraying characters on the edge of a strait razor, and here he paints yet another wonderful performance in the history of cinema, despite his short screen time.<br/><br/>Aside for this a note worth mention: the arduous work by Francis Ford Coppola in making this masterpiece possible is documented in ""the hearts of darkness"", a documentary about the already known troubles that plagued the shooting and production of this movie. But that, is for another review I hope my words have been of some help to you!"

","Disturbingly surreal and real, Apocalypse Now is so classic because it is the first, and to this day the only war movie of its kind, in that it conveys the darkness and brutality of Vietnam through not just a deception of the grim reality of war like any other preaching drama film would to hammer their message through, but by the psychological torment to come from the horrors of war, by vividly expressing its reality through the means of hazy and bizarre experiments in thick atmosphere, and bleakly unsettling nihilistic philosophy based upon its reality. This results in a film morbidly shocking and gruesome on the surface, while at the same time being subtle in its strangeness, with the latter ending up being more disturbing than the gore, and both nevertheless just as impressionable as one another while sharing an epic scope. A literally pitch-PERFECT piece with prevalent dark overtones, and the masterfully executed ambition to heighten the impact to such an effective level to be a cinematic experience unlike anything else in film history."

","""Apocalypse Now"" throws away standard narrative rules, and establishes itself as a tour de force of visual achievement.<br/><br/>The storyline is truly amazing. Adapted from Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", it moves the story from 19th century imperialist Africa to Vietnam. Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is on a mission to ""terminate with extreme prejudice"", a renegade colonel, Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has created an army of natives and holed up somewhere in Cambodia. Willard is to travel up river to find him. Along the way, he comes across many encounters that make him realize the insanity and horror of Vietnam. While it is mostly excellent, the ending is a little unfocused.<br/><br/>Willard is a superbly developed character. He begins in a paradox - he hates to be in the jungle and he hates to be on leave, trapped in the city. He is simply following orders. Along the journey, reading about Col. Kurtz, he begins to identify with him. Every character is acted perfectly, except for Kurtz. It seems that Brando had little focus about what he wanted his character to be like, and it shows. Robert Duvall particularly does an excellent job as Lt. Col. Kilgore, who is obsessed with surfing.<br/><br/>The technical achievements of this movie are in its visuals and its atmosphere. The atmosphere of going up the river, further into a strange, unknown land, is incredible. As Willard travels into the jungle, he becomes more and more like Kurtz, the setting parallelling his descent into madness. Visually, this movie is one of the greatest of all time. The entire helicopter raid sequence is perhaps the best fifteen or twenty minutes ever committed to film. It is indescribable - rather, it must be viewed to appreciate.<br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" is not a flawless movie.

While we get there more and more questions are raised about the nature of the war that is being fought, as madness isn't only waiting on that other end of the journey, but becomes a principle in itself on the way - thus questioning the mission, the causes and the means: Man's position between animal and god is uncertain, but as self-assigned master over life and death his decline into madness only seems like a natural reaction..."
"arodmitton","9","0","1","16 March 2012"," Blown away!
","This film is based on a 1906 Joseph Conrad novella titled ""Heart of Darkness"". I would suggest to everybody that enjoyed this movie, to read this story. It's not very long, about 80+ pages, but well worth the time. Reading the novella actually increased my enjoyment and understanding of the film. Obviously, the film is ""loosely-based"" on the novella. The time period, setting and circumstances were completely different in the film than in the story. Coppola, and the screenwriters, however, managed to capture one of the most important aspects of the story in the savagery that exists in the jungle and the effects it can have on the human psyche. I found Marlow's growing fascination with Kurtz in the book to be an interesting parallel to Willard's , played by Martin Sheen, fascination with the colonel. As both men travel up their respective rivers, getting ever closer actually meeting the man that inspired the admiration and obsession in both of these men, they come to start to understand the reasoning's and methods to their respective Kurtz's insanity. <br/><br/>As Willard sets upon his journey, he encounters obvious examples of the Army's hypocrisy in their wants to remove Kurtz from his post. Was Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore's insanity more excusable than Kurtz's? From the brutality of war that he witnessed in his prior tours of Vietnam, to the savagery that plagues his current mission, he starts to see the world as Kurtz does, understanding the inner machinations of the man's mind. There is a contrast here to Conrad's Marlow, in that Willard starts out as a jaded character, and judges Kurtz from different point of view than Marlowe does. As Marlowe is just a steamboat captain that works for ""The Company"", his interpretation of Kurtz is different. Both, however, come to realize their own inner darkness that occupies a hidden corner in their heart. With Willard, his transformation at the end of the film after he kills Kurtz and is standing in the doorway of the temple(?), covered in mud and blood is a perfect allegory to the darkness that filled his heart.<br/><br/>Kurtz is the most powerful character here. As in the novella, Colonel Kurtz is a man shrouded in mystery. As Willard learns more about him, we start to see a different side of the man than the man Army Intelligence portrays. They portray him as a monster, whereas, we start to see the multi-talented, enigmatic side of Kurtz as Willard starts to learn about him. Even though he is in less than 10% of the film, much like the novella, his shadow casts a darkness over the entire jungle and his presence is felt throughout the entire movie. Marlon Brando turned in another excellent performance as the mad colonel, with his philosophical ravings and soliloquies being some of the best he's put on film. A large part of the success of the portrayal of Kurtz does definitely have to go to the film's director though. Coppola does a fantastic job of keeping Brando in shadows and Brando uses the shadows to his advantage, almost wearing the darkness like a thick blanket. He is often portraying Kurtz as hunched over, as if weighted down by the darkness in his heart. This performance left no doubt as to why Coppola would want to work with this genius again, after previously working with him on The Godfather. <br/><br/>This is one of the finer films in film history and certainly deserves its place as a classic piece of cinema. Both the novella and the film go to lengths to warn us of the darkness that exists in all of us, and what may be madness to most people, may just be enlightenment.<br/><br/>The horror... the horror..."

","""Apocalypse Now"" is as powerful a war film as you're ever likely to see. The film is basically a mad-house of powerful imagery, sounds, and moody atmosphere - all this is done at the highly capable hands of director Francis Ford Coppola (working from the novella ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad). Coppola is not one of my favorite filmmakers, but ""Apocalypse Now"" is the one film of his I've always admired and had a deep fondness for. The film works on a base level that seems to appeal to your worst feelings. ""Apocalypse Now"" is a dark, violent, visually disturbing motion picture. Set during the Vietnam War, the film concerns the covert mission of Captain Benjamin L. Willard (the great Martin Sheen, in my favorite performance of his), a military assassin, to kill the rogue Colonel Kurtz (the late Marlon Brando), who has proclaimed himself god in a heavily fortified fortress located deep in the heart of Vietnam. Willard accompanies a small Army boat crew to take him up a river for him to complete his mission. ""Apocalypse Now"" is a war film that does not play around in the visually disturbing imagery category, including the graphic combat violence and the (reportedly) live slaughter of a live a water buffalo for a ritualistic sacrifice by Vietnamese villagers. Kurtz's powerful final words signify the meaning of the whole picture - the utter ""horror,"" and the utter insanity of war.<br/><br/>10/10"

","On the surface of the film, it is directly about a crew of American soldiers who are travelling during the Vietnam War down a dangerous river leading to Cambodia, in order to escort the commanding officer, Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen), on a classified mission. He must find a man who was once a great American fighter who was in the Special Forces, but unfortunately began to lose his mind and became the leader of a murderous colony. The commanding officer is clearly distraught by the fact that he must slaughter one of his own people, and not just an American, but a former soldier. Benjamin Willard and his group of men are forced to deal with many situations as they arise and not everyone makes it out alive. Many scenes show the disturbing factors of the war and utter insanity. Underneath the general story line is an intense transformation of the men over the duration of the film. It provides an inside look at the journey into darkness the men must face. It has a contrast in moods through the movie because at some points it shows the chaos and the torment caused by the war, and other times the setting is bright and everyone is smiling and joking. The film establishes many moods and settings through montages and long shot pictures. The film can be extremely difficult to follow however because scenes jump around often and there are tons of characters, some of which are only around for a scene or two and then never reappear.

","Apocalypse Now is based on the incredible challenges of the Vietnam War. The plot revolves around the mission of Martin Sheene's character Captain Willard. He has been affected by the War in such a way that it has become impossible for him to act as a normal citizen and war is the only thing that makes sense in his life. Captain Willard has been sent out deep into the jungle to destroy Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, played by Marlin Brando, who has taken the war to a whole new level, and has left the controls of the Army behind him. Colonel Kurtz has gone off the reservation and the Army wants his reign of terror put to an end. The movie revolves around the steps that Captain Willard must take to get to Colonel Kurtz and how he completes his mission. While this is the action sequence the actual theme of this film lies in the manifestation of fear, pain, and horror that grips the lives of the men that live through it and die from it. Director Francis Ford Coppola masterfully brings the pain of the solider directly into our minds with the incredible cinematography that is used to bring life to the film. The shots of the jungle illustrate how solitary and confined the American soldier was in Vietnam, yet how close the enemy could be at any time. Coppola dares to expose the reality of life in a land that destroyed the lives of so many young men from this country. He does this with a sense of love and respect for the living veterans, and honor for the fallen, yet he has refused to sugar coat how painful and disgusting war is. Coppola has created a masterpiece that will be acknowledged as an incredible example of the plight and trials of the Vietnam Soldier. Watching the way that Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, played by Robert Duvall, seems to make light of the war and ignores the danger and destruction of everything around him paints a picture of how easy it is for these men to walk the thin line between insanity and bravery. If it is true that a man can actually ""Love the smell of napalm in the morning"", it forces one to wonder if that smell can been disconnected from its effects, or if a man can actually enjoy the smell of burning and death. The film is an ire reminder and example of how devastating the Vietnam War was to so many people. It also connected us with the very real truth that every man has a breaking point and every man is capable of doing things that they would never imagine possible when placed in dire situations. The darkness that engulfs the film is evident throughout the film everywhere from the fear of soldiers who are seemingly deserted, to the darkness of the jungle. The lighting in the jungle shows the viewer how quickly one could be lost in the vastness of the country, and how dangerous it is to be anywhere in Vietnam. The enemy is more than just a man with a gun, it seems like everything in this place wants to kill them. Darkness surrounds every character in the film even if they are intent on ignoring it or seeking every opportunity to find an escape from it. There are moments of carefree living where the crew seems to have not a care in the world, but these moments become obvious failures in experience and understanding. Fear drives the movie from a sometimes unseen seat, yet the truth and reality is fully understood that the seriousness of the situations will have effects lasting a lifetime to all the characters, no matter how long or short those lives may be."

","Apocalypse Now is the story of a US Army Captain named Willard who is ordered to travel to Cambodia to kill a renegade US Colonel (Colonel Kurtz) who has gone insane and is fighting on his own, with his own army. At first, Captain Willard can't possibly understand why that man had gone ballistic, but as his journey moves forward, he starts to witness the insane side of war (the only one I believe) and how much the war has affected the ones he met and his crew itself. This film is the best war film in the sense that depicts what war is really about: loss of innocence, madness and death. There's no ""good war"" as someone said, and Coppola let us know through this incredibly filmed masterpiece, that there are no winners in war, everybody involved in it lose something: an arm, a life and most of all sanity. So, as I stated before, this film is a kind of ""there's more than meets the eye"" thing. Sure, the backdrop is the Vietnam war, but the main theme is how much a war can affect the human psyche of those who fight in it. Knowing beforehand that war is barbaric act, does the men who fight in a war need to become barbarians to be able to cope it?. One thing is certain, and that is that we are civilized people and when we are out of our social environment, our barbaric instincts emerge to take hold of our life in order to survive. That's what happened to Kurtz and Willard understood it well when he faced it and saw where he was at. Did he became like Kurtz after he killed him?. For what I could sensed, I say no, but I really think he became aware of what is (in my opinion) may be the real horror of war, and that is to lose your mind by becoming someone else opposite than you totally were, in this case, a civilized human being.

War is a state of mind, yes, but war is made of fights, guts splattered, instant deaths, cries, shouts, explosions of napalm and insanity, genuine breakdowns and orgasmic thrills  everything is real, yet, with a depth never reached by another War film, before or after. There will never be another ""Apocalypse Now"".<br/><br/>The film challenges your perceptions with an incredibly haunting cinematography, taking you in a road whose end is uncertain  but uncertainty is like the uncomfortable pillow while patriotism acts as sleeping pills. In more comprehensible words, the value of life is so questionable in wartime that the very idea of winning and losing is useless. Are we humans or are we tools? Why the war? If ""Apocalypse Now"" answered these questions, the script would have lost my respect. But instead of telling us why the war exists, Coppola shows what war is. It doesn't even make it more rational, or more understandable, but the film is not about answering questions; it's about making us question ourselves.<br/><br/>And we question ourselves. In the boots of Captain Willard, a man whose strange top secret mission will plunge him into the depth of the insanity governing a War. But ""Apocalypse Now"" is not a descent into madness; it's a thought-provoking script inviting us to a journey introspecting the very meaning of War as a conflict that tortures our minds. War starts inside us. And the first victim of a war is not the man we'll kill, it's our spirit that we destroy forever, this part of us, for which, human value had a meaning. And forever means forever  we banish ourselves from human community as soon as we participate to war. It's a duty condemning us for eternal alienation, for a purgatory, whose symbolic incarnation is the Colonel Kurtz's tribe, the objective of Willard's mission.<br/><br/>Kurtz, created a universe where War has been pushed to its more extreme expression. He reached his breaking point and literally went insane, alienated by a desire to grave War in golden letters, to give a meaning to his military duty. And Coppola's approach is a stroke of genius, because it leaves us perplexed, torn between fascination and disgust, and our guilt to lean towards the former one. The movie doesn't try to inspire our disgust; it respects our intelligence enough not to be judgmental. On the contrary, we respect these men fallen in the trap of an inevitable insanity. They may be assassins, soldiers; they're still men as long as they tried to follow a path made of an idea of what is duty. Yes, they're morally wrong, but in wartime, the only right is to win. Fighting is obligatory. The rest is bullshit.<br/><br/>And this is why ""Apocalypse Now"" is the movie that best defines war. Because this bullshit, whatever it is, is made of the most precious things you have in your life. And you, soon, get the feeling, that the movie invites you to discover a universe where your only choice is to die or to survive by becoming more ruthless and cold-blooded than your enemy. Kurtz knew that. Willard will know that. And we learn that. ""Apocalypse Now"" is not about war, it IS War in the most horrific and realistic view. It's real, it's made of feeling, not ideas, the only ones who express ideas in the film (I'm talking of the Redux version) are those who don't fight. Fighters don't think, they cry, they shout, they object, but ultimately, they kill or are killed, there are no alternatives, and when you kill, it's not to be killed. <br/><br/>It's about learning to kill; it's about exploring the most efficient ways to terminate the enemy, about desensitizing ourselves to feel the power not to fear war, but to spouse it in a bloody nuptial nightmare. Desensitizing, indeed, no passion in War, no excitement, no entertainment, no enjoyment, whoever enjoys war condemns himself for death or failure. This is why the first segment of Willard's twisted odyssey is to enlighten us about the inevitability of the American defeat, and the exhilaration driven by the iconic Ride of the Valkyries' helicopter scene, by Colonel Kilgore's charisma, by the bunnies' sexy dancing, or the psychedelic effects of the ""Satisfaction"" scene, with the water skiing, are just misleading. The road is on the river, the boat is the only referential, but the closer they'll get to Kurtz, the more palpable will be the effects of war. And to get Kurtz is to become Kurtz, and to understand Kurtz is to understand war. To understand war, is to understand hell.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola is a genius, because he offered to Cinema a unique creation, defining Cinema as an Art, as something meaningful, with a strange capability to make us feel something we didn't experience, like the emptiness of a hellish War where the only way of survival is killing, and passionless killing though. No room for feelings, this is the Apocalypse. And the way the movie opens, speaks loudly the horrific message to humanity  This is the end."

","Apocalypse Now (1979) chronicles a decorated and respected Captain who is sent on a mission to locate and terminate a fellow green beret who has ""gone rogue."" Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) learns of his mission and is instantly mesmerized by the eccentric Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who appears to have established a camp in Cambodia and has effectively gone AWOL from his military duties in the Vietnam War. During his trip up the Nung River, Willard encounters many conflicts and loses half of the Navy crew who is escorting him upriver. Upon reaching Colonel Kurtz's camp, Willard quickly realizes that those who have remained at the compound are under the spell of their charismatic leader. They firmly believe in his cause and regard him as a hero. Among those living at the compound are numerous dead bodies and severed heads lying around—presumably to warn anyone who is considering removing Colonel Kurtz from his post.<br/><br/>This film is primarily plot-driven and uses period-specific music to convey emotion and stress. The Vietnam War, having only just ended a few years prior to the filming of this movie, was the underlying theme of this film. All of the struggles faced by soldiers—political, emotional, physical, and psychological—are documented in this picture. The beginning of the movie starts with Willard reminiscing about his previous tour in Vietnam, and we know from the voice over that he wants to return to Vietnam. He states that he is waiting for his next mission. However, when the two soldiers come to give him orders, he is visibly shaken and seems to be reluctant to return to war. He finally receives his orders, only to learn that his mission is to terminate one of his own—a highly regarded Colonel no less. Following the trials of young soldiers sent to Vietnam to fight a long and difficult war and the aftermath of psychological issues is a theme present in many movies, like Platoon for example.<br/><br/>Sound effects were very important to this movie. Most of what we learn about Willard is conveyed via voice-over, and he shows little to no emotion in this film. He speaks to the viewer matter-of-factly, and the music or sound effects in the background assist in conveying emotion and stress or creating anticipation. Also important to the film was the use of natural lighting. Since this movie was shot on location, the director took advantage of the natural beauty of the surroundings as well as using the natural light to create the proper atmosphere for the various scenes. For example, while filming the scene where the soldiers are sitting around a campfire, the only light in the scene is the glow from the campfire. This makes the viewer feel as if he or she is actually there on that beach with the rest of the unit.<br/><br/>Movies about war serve to remind us that we should never take the sacrifices made by soldiers and their families for granted."
"Steffi_P","8","0","1","14 February 2011"," ""Better than Disneyland""
","There were a lot of movies made about the Vietnam war in the fifteen years or so following its end. They varied considerably in their approach, but one thing they all had in common was an attempt to understand and come to terms with what was surely the most unpopular and widely condemned war of the 20th century. Apocalypse Now tries to explain the war in abstract terms, as part calculated slaughter and part incompetent chaos, part Mad Max and part Lord of the Flies, and presents its story in the form of a surreal, operatic nightmare.<br/><br/>Although Apocalypse Now's in-the-field production notoriously became an almighty cinematic endeavour, at its heart is a classy screenplay by John Milius and Francis Ford Coppola that has two totally perfect aspects to it. The first is its perfect pacing, designed for a tense and exciting and carefully controlled build-up to a finale. The first half hour or so deals with a no-holds-barred depiction of the brutal realities of warfare. From here on situations become increasingly bizarre and removed from reality – a descent into a surrealist maelstrom. The little revelations about Colonel Kurtz's past are interspersed throughout the picture, feeding us this fascinating man's story one titbit at a time. The second aspect is its perfect dialogue, most of which was presumably provided by Milius, the acknowledged master of such. Milius has the true touch of the poet, creating dialogue that, with just a few teasing words, conjures up images more vivid than a whole paragraph of description - ""Every minute Charlie squats in the bushes""; ""He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam""; ""I realised, like I was shot with a diamond bullet"". Notice the unusual choice of words that just makes a sentence that little bit more characteristic. For example, instead of ""the walls moved in a little closer"", we get ""the walls moved in a little tighter"". Unconventional, a little less logical, but far more evocative.<br/><br/>As a director Francis Ford Coppola has the difficult task of giving the movie its strange and stylised tone without making it too obviously ""filmmaker-ish"". There is a clear attempt here to maximise the viewer's sense of immersion by avoiding any reminders of cinematic artifice, right down to dispensing with end credits. However in order to give the picture the rhythmic, dreamlike quality it requires there are occasional odd manoeuvres, such as panning over to the white curtain at the end of the briefing scene, but this sort of thing is never obtrusive because the stylisation of Apocalypse Now is all of a piece. Camera movement is slow, smooth and repetitive, with frequent use of horizontal tracking shots such as the one with which the picture opens. What's more, a lot of the odd look of Apocalypse Now is within the scene, not in what the camera does. The early scenes like the massacre at the village are filled with surreal but plausible images such as the coloured smoke bombs or a cow being airlifted. Towards the end of the movie, characters' movements become eerie and dance-like, the lighting becomes more stark and the sound design more ominous. A lot of the credit also goes to cinematographer Vittorio Storaro and editor Walter Murch for completing the finished look.<br/><br/>But there is a problem in Apocalypse Now's precision and stylisation. The build-up to the crew's arrival at Kurtz's compound is so effective, so promising, that the actual finale becomes a bit of a letdown. And by this point, the creeping weirdness of the picture is verging on the tedious. And while Marlon Brando's Kurtz is an awesome presence worthy of the character, Dennis Hopper's annoyingly hammy and formulaic madman act is too little too late. The lack of a sympathetic protagonist also makes for somewhat unrewarding viewing. Apocalypse Now is a grandly ambitious movie, a noble envisaging of the Vietnam war as a hallucinatory horror, but in its perfection of style it lacks a little heart and soul."
"dave13-1","9","0","1","14 February 2011"," One of the most ambitious movies of the 70s
","Apocalypse Now is one of those movies on which few critics agree. It was extremely ambitious, and what you think of it really comes down to what you thought those ambitions were and whether you thought they were met. The original theatrical version had a couple of scenes missing, a scene with a French family at a plantation and scene where the boat catches up to the Playboy girls a second time at a fuel dump. The studio wanted them cut because the movie was running long, but without them you get a feeling that some story threads are left hanging. The director's cut is more structurally coherent and more fully explored thematically, but also longer and a bit draggy. The shorter version feels a bit more episodic and disjointed, which critics who disliked it when they saw it in the 70s seized on as a major flaw, but it really wasn't. Simply a shortcoming of rather grand ambitions.<br/><br/>In Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, a guy goes upriver in Africa to find a white jungle trader, now sick. The corruption caused by illness parallels the corruption of the man's soul. It's a rumination on the nature of evil in men. But the movie doesn't really follow the plot of the book. The movie's other major conceptual influence was Dante's Inferno, an epic Italian poem in which the narrator is given a tour of Hell. Vietnam is presented in the movie like Dante's conception of Hell, and the illustrations of Hieronymous Bosch who created several famous paintings of Dante's vision. Nightmarish images of waste and the futility of life and wages of sin.<br/><br/>Images like that damaged helicopter hanging out of jungle tree are designed to resonate with the work of Dante and Bosch. It's not just a wrecked helo, it's an image of human failure and corruption. Anyway, Dante's work is episodic, as the narrator tours one area of Hell, then another with little or no connecting narrative thread. The movie is rather this way too. Then when the movie makes it to Marlon Brando's camp, it comes sharply back to Conrad's book, as Brando is Kurtz, Vietnam equivalent to the Brit trader in Heart of Darkness. Brando forces Willard to confront his ambivalence about the war. Is Kurtz himself evil, or just more in tune with an evil enterprise than they are? It's a story about war as a human activity, in which war takes on all aspects of the human experience. Exhilarating, horrifying, nightmarish, grotesque, elusive, unfair and above all illogical. Kilgore and Kurtz are clearly insane, but did the war make them that way or select them because they were that way? Willard is presented as the only rational man in an irrational situation and his inability to make sense of the experience is a key how the viewer should respond."
"jayson_valentine","10","0","1","10 January 2011"," One of the most brilliant films.
","Apocalypse Now is a Vietnam film that distinguishes itself from all others; not insomuch in its caliber of artistry, but in its unique existential perspectives on how the macabre settings of war effect the human psyche. Whereas other Vietnam movies are more politically themed, whether patriotic or communist sympathetic, Coppola's undisputed masterpiece (in my opinion) remains to be the greatest film made on its subject.<br/><br/>Aside from the delicate philosophical undertones in the haunting narratives and gruesome anti-war messages, the film's strongest technical aspect is the uncanny cinematography and editing; not to mention amazingly constructed large outdoor sets and relentless action. Along with the choice of filming location and authentic acting, the realism of this film surpasses all that I've seen. There is never a dull moment in this film as it is completely hypnotic from the starting montage.<br/><br/>As much as I admire this film, I do not recommend it for everyone. This film is for intelligent and open-minded viewers and not for everyday, average moviegoers. If you haven't seen it, I personally recommend the 2001 Redux Cut."
"Tom-But","10","0","1","19 December 2010"," ""Do you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'......?""
","After discovering that the running time for the Redux of Apocalypse Now was more than 3 hours, I dreaded watching it much like one might dread a 12 hour non-stop flight in Economy Class with no television privileges and male flight attendants while seated next to an overly chummy and flatulent overweight man named Huey who thinks that an arm rest is supposed to allow for the comfort of separating his monstrous ass cheeks from one another so as to avoid chafing... Seriously, that entire scenario played out in my mind. That being said, my love for Coppola, Brando and Duvall as a collective entity had been well and truly instated ever since The Godfather, as had my profound respect for Martin Sheen in light of more recent fare such as The West Wing and The Departed. Bearing all of this in mind, I was compelled to at least attempt sitting through this thing. I remember watching the original many years before the Redux and, while I found it compelling and provocative, it was probably not the ideal environment, and so I felt that watching the Redux was necessary. With that, I took myself downstairs to my small and wholly improvised home theatre, sat myself in a precarious position upon the edge of a beanbag and pressed play on the remote... Approximately 200 minutes later, as the final credit rolled, I suddenly became aware of a sharp pain in my lower back, and it wasn't until I laid back in the beanbag that I fully realized what had happened. I was instantly reminded of a small article written by actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, in which he recalled a visit to a local theatre as a young man to see Scorsese's Goodfellas. He remembered the film finishing only to discover that he was sitting on the very edge of his seat, much as he had been when the film began. ""I'm sure I meant to make myself more comfortable"", he writes. ""I guess I just never got around to it..."" That is the best endorsement I can offer for Apocalypse Now, for the original 1979 version and for the Redux. The film transcends its own frail medium, indelibly imprinting itself on one's memory as if it were some tragic yet revelatory personal experience. It may very well be responsible for more cases of post-traumatic tendencies than the Vietnam war itself! But of course, as anyone with dimensional grasp will explain (often condescendingly), this film isn't really about Vietnam, or any war for that matter, but instead how humanity is tainted and almost always permanently crippled by brutality, by immorality... by horror. The elements that naturally occur during warfare. Really, this film could have been set at any time or place (real or fictitious) in which the boundary between what is right and what is necessary is irrevocably blurred. Speaking as an Australian (and not in a way that condones any atrocious actions as ""necessary""), this film could have been made during the Stolen Generation period, with many liberties taken and altered to fit the context of course. But I suppose at the time for America, and for the rest of the world, Vietnam was the relevant component needed; it was, perhaps, even the actual entry point for the audience, the very element that they related with, despite the terrible emotional counterparts associated with it. It's redundant to say that the performances are spectacular; if you're at all a well-travelled film-goer, just a glimpse at the cast list should give you an idea. Complaints will and effectively have been raised regarding the two longest additions to Redux, being the intervals involving the Bunnies and the French Plantation. Over-analysis is a practice designed for the very purpose of robbing art of its intangible beauty, so to speak too much on these scenes would kill them. Suffice it to say that I myself was entirely befuddled with these additions until the final moments of the latter, in which a character says to Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), ""There are two of you, don't you see? One that kills, and one that loves."" Think long and hard on that in relation to the film. I think it's probably one of the best inclusions Coppola made. How about you?"

","I've almost worn out my copy of Apocalypse Now. I'm proof of the theory of Poor-Cheap-Alternative Existence, where I will buy tobacco or alcohol instead of a nice copy of one of my favorite movies. So yesterday, I got The Complete Dossiere from a mall. Contains the original film as well as AN Redux. So on with my review of maybe the greatest war film made for kids under 60 and over. Who wish that they are kids. In the movie, Dennis Hopper as the photojournalist(no name given), is as spaced out as Lance On The Forward Fifties. Lance has dropped acid during the long odyssey. The more the journalist talks about dialectics and different theories, it becomes quite clear the guy is ""out there somewhere"". But Colonel Kurtz is a little different in his mental state after losing it. The Colonel is dangerous. He has to be.. he has had too much training in the art of military strategics and tactical movement. I thought at one time what would happen if Willard had tried to bring the Colonel back to the U.S. Not a good idea. Throughout the trip to where Kurtz' encampment was, Captain Willard kept thinking the same way. This isn't right, he thought. Did not make any sense. The dossier did not describe a Colonel who was on his second foray into Southeast Asia, and had shown his skills as a commander. Kurtz was taking situations into his own hands, I believe that is what bothered the generals. Yet Kurtz, the captain found later, was going over the line, not operating within the restraint of HQ or within the limits of good reason.<br/><br/>The photojournalist said to Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, ""you don't talk to the Colonel. You listen to him."" He was right. Willard listened and listened, and the things the Colonel said verified what Willard had been told was a foregone conclusion at the beginning of his journey to Cambodia."

"jackfelter","10","0","1","26 October 2010"," Richly engrossing film
","Of all the movies about Vietnam, Apocalypse Now is certainly not the closest to reality. Movies that showcase units of soldiers fighting the war are a far more accurate representation of modern-day war. Although mercenaries are necessary in some scenarios, they are not practical for a great majority of operations. Also, the military would never send a lone mercenary to take down another. Perhaps a unit of Special Forces, but never a separated person with no way of reporting back to the base. However, in the case presented in the movie I can see why it might be necessary. One of the most deadly personnel of the military completely at home and integrated into his environment might require a knife in the back. Especially if he was in a friendly nation neighboring the one currently at war."

","I just saw the terrific documentary Hearts of Darkness, all about the making of Apocalypse Now, and it made me curious to go back and watch the movie again. It's a great film, and it plays better now than it did when I first saw it. The virtuoso Wagner scene with the helicopter attack has actually improved over time, in part because it's so startling to see a complicated, beautifully organized battle sequence that's not done with any CGI. And a lot of the things that bored me or annoyed me the first time I watched the movie now add interesting depths and detours to the film. The storyline is about as straightforward as possible: an assassin goes upriver on a mission to kill a renegade colonel. But the film keeps veering off from the mission to asides that are much more enjoyable on a second viewing: the weird interlude with the Playboy bunny performance (a great satire on all those old sugary USO shows from the past), the jungle conversation about sauces, the search of the local boat that ends in a bloodbath, the walk along the trenches around the bridge that ""keeps getting built back up every night, just so the VC can tear it down again."" I also found myself enjoying the Brando scenes much more than I did before. They actually follow Conrad pretty closely, both in spirit and in action, and a lot of thought has gone into them -- enough to make you realize how little thought goes into most war movies nowadays, how satisfied they are with not even bothering to ask any troubling or difficult questions. Apocalypse Now doesn't have any answers to those questions, but neither did Conrad, and the movie is actually better than the novel in one sense: Conrad, because of the era he was writing in, couldn't really show us what Kurtz meant at the end when he talked about ""the horror, the horror."" Apocalypse Now shows us, and does it so well that Kurtz's last words hold more meaning for us at the end of the film than they do at the end of the book."

","Terminate with Extreme prejudice.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now begins with no opening credits, just a shot of trees and some helicopters. Then, the forest erupts into flames as the song ""The End"" begins. I can think of no better way to begin such a film with. It sets the mood perfectly for what is about to happen. The, it transitions straight into a voice-over from Captain Millard, masterfully played by Martin Sheen. In the first five minutes, you go deeper into Willard's character than some films can take you in 3 hours. Willard is given a mission to go up river and kill the renegade Col. Kurtz.<br/><br/>I love the smell of napalm in the morning.<br/><br/>Willard is taken down the Nung river by PBR Streetgang, a crew consisting completely of strange characters. They take him right to the front lines, where they are met by Lt. Col. Kilgore, played by Robert DuVall. Though his screen time is brief, about 25 min. of the 2 1/2 hour film, he makes each minute count, giving an astoundingly believable performance. His character is also somewhat frightening, as he gives you the first glimpse of the horror of the war.<br/><br/>Don't get out of the boat. Absolutely godd*nm right. Unless you were going' all the way.<br/><br/>After departing into the river, the crew enters what seems like another world. Throughout the journey, it slowly gets darker and further from reality. Sheen's voice-overs give the viewer a terrifying picture of Kurtz, and you also learn about the true characters of all the men. Even Willard himself, you see, has a very dark side to him. As they get closer to Kurtz, the insanity builds, both around them and in them. Then the deaths begin, and they are some of the most terrifying on-screen deaths ever.<br/><br/>You're and errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect the bill.<br/><br/>Willard and the survivors of the crew arrive at the compound in Cambodia, where Kurtz has been set up as a god by the local tribe and a group of Americans that live there. Kurtz, played by THE Marlon Brando, is very obviously insane...or is he? They were gonna make me a major for this, and I wasn't even in their f*cking army anymore.<br/><br/>When Willard meets Kurtz, he finds he has no clue what to do. He questions Kutz's mental state as well as his own. The difference between right and wrong, good and evil, and life and death is blurred.<br/><br/>The horror..The horror.<br/><br/>In the end, Willard kills Kurtz during the natives' highly symbolic caribou sacrifice. As Kutz dies he utters those famous, resounding final words. Willard and the only survivor of PBR Streetgang depart without a word.<br/><br/>The entire film is a descent to madness and to hell. From the very start, it is terrifying, and it only intensifies as it goes. It never lets up. Just when you think it can't get any scarier, it goes off the deep end, and especially so with the ending.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is quite simply a brilliant piece of film-making and tied for my favorite movie of all time (see review for The Godfather) and it may perhaps be even superior to that masterwork. Coppola, who directed both films, is a genius. The acting was flawless. The cinematography, sound, visual effects, music, etc. are some of the best that film has ever produced. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who loves film. It is an experience that should never be missed. The descent of the human soul is one of my favorite themes, and it has never been portrayed better than in Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>To describe this film curtly, ""Wow"" almost does it justice."

Showing just how far of the lengths Coppola went to show the pain and endearing it took a person during the war in Vietnam. Coppola wanted you to be aware of the sense of the horror, madness and the overall moral dilemma of soldiers in the Vietnam war. The film depicts a group of U.S assassins and soldiers that need to clear out a former Colonel of the AWOL and while doing this they deal with the trials and tribulations of being a soldier at the same time. I feel that at times Coppola made the movie the way it is to not only show you what was happening in Vietnam but to have you visually absorb the feelings of the people as they forego on one of the most physically and mentally challenging mission anyone could imagine."

","Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic stands out as one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. I regret that it wasn't until 2005 that I finally made an effort to see this film but I'm eternally grateful that I eventually did. I am personally a fan of the 2001 extended REDUX re-release though the original is still an amazing piece of work. The film follows Captain Benjamin Willard as he embarks on a classified mission into the jungles of Cambodia to hunt down the estranged Colonel Walter Kurtz, who has broken off from the military and embedded himself deep in the jungle. He has established himself as a deity over a native tribe and the military has deemed his methods ""unsound"". Over the course of the journey down the river, we witness how the horrors of the war affect Captain Willard and the crew of the PBR Street Gang.<br/><br/>I've seen this film countless times at this point and, even at it's over three hour run-time (for the REDUX version), it never ceases to amaze me. I really can't say enough about this film, as I truly loved everything about it: the perfect casting, the beautiful cinematography, the interesting characters, and the feeling it gives as I watch these characters slowly change over the course of the movie. Vittorio Storaro did an amazing job with this film; I loved his use of light and shadow (especially in the final act) and his use of color throughout the film. His Academy Award for this film was well-deserved. Coppola shot this entire film in the Philippines and the story of the film's creation is just as enthralling as the film itself; if you are able, I highly recommend listening to Coppola's commentary on the DVD or, if you can find it, do yourself a favor and watch his wife's documentary HEART OF DARKNESS.<br/><br/>The heart of this film lies in the intriguing characters. From the start, the character of Willard (Martin Sheen) has had his life ruined by Vietnam. His wife divorced him and all he can focus on is the next mission. As he traverses the river, reading Kurtz's dossier and witnessing travesty after travesty of the war, we witness changes in him and we begin to wonder if he's beginning to understand the ""madness"" of Kurtz. Colonel Kurtz is infamously portrayed by Marlon Brando and, despite the notorious problems on-set with the actor, I loved the cold, strong demeanor Brando brings to the character. We see what Kurtz has become through his time in the jungle and we may even begin to sympathize with him (or at least see what he meant to accomplish).<br/><br/>The supporting characters in the film are equally as impressive as the main players with Dennis Hopper as the tripped-out photo-journalist at Kurtz's compound (one of my favorite characters) and Robert Duvall's Oscar-nominated performance as surf-enthusiast Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore of the Air Cavalry in one of the film's most memorable (and often imitated) sequences. Accompanying Willard on his mission is the crew of the PBR Street Gang, including a young Laurence Fishburne his first major film role. I loved the character of Lance Johnson (Sam Bottoms), California surf pro turn Vietnam soldier. He starts the film as your average young soldier but drugs and stress nearly make him a jungle native by the end.<br/><br/>I truly adore this film and I hope the negativity surrounding it from some won't affect the decisions of those who may not have seen the film yet. I do recommend starting with the original theatrical and, if you find yourself wanting more, move on to the REDUX version. Every time I watch the film, I'm blown away and I hope those who are just now watching it for the first time feel the same. Enjoy."

","Captain Benjamin Willard (Sheen) is sent into the jungle during the Vietnam War to find a respected but apparently insane Colonel Kurtz (Brando) and kill him.<br/><br/>Renowned for being one of the finest war films ever made Apocalypse Now 30 years still remains a shocking punch to the face, an emotionally powerful battle of wits and certainly a memorable picturesque collection of direction by Francis Coppola.<br/><br/>Replicating the dramatic war of the late 50's to the mid 70's this picture is a remarkable and dramatic achievement to compare to the real terrifying experiences soldiers and societies experienced during times of warfare.<br/><br/>The film opens with Willard sitting silently in his hotel room, reminding himself of his experience in the jungle and how his life has changed since then. Martin Sheen's narration invites us into his mind filled with regret and turmoil, a mind so blinded with past experiences its difficult to see the future. His turns of mad drunkenness spell disaster for anyone in his vicinity and when marshals come knocking the character regains some moderate composure as he learns what he must do.<br/><br/>The mission is outlined by some splendid supporting characters including Harrison Ford and the mission adds delicious tension and a dramatic conflict for the film's main character. How he must murder a man who has become a rising hero within the military ranks. This whole concept is thrown into the way of a man who has inspiration to achieve what his target has achieved and the mission becomes personal and the tension rises right until the very last moment.<br/><br/>Along the way there are inclusions of the rough warfare spreading out across the surroundings in the Philippines and Godfather and Dracula director Francis Coppola implements a beautiful selection of shots despite the dark story.<br/><br/>The film is renowned for the sunset pictures and by juxtaposing them with machines such as helicopters adds a strong dilemma to proceedings.<br/><br/>The rising silhouette of the airship is an unforgettable montage and the synchronization and formation as more join in a line is simply unbelievable, a renowned piece of filming that carries on throughout the world of film and whilst there have been attempts to replicate such beauty, e.g. Top Gun, none have matched the originality and lighting and breathtaking sweeps as here. If there was a major reason to see this film that is it.<br/><br/>The score adds the tension alongside the picturesque styling of Coppola but it has to be said the inclusion of meaningful emotions plays a vital role in confiding the plot's main themes of duty and truth. The inclusion of renowned poetry come the end, the line of work the main characters are involved in and the grasp of freedom all seek builds up their personas, generating an overall splendid array of plot, of power and precision that has rightfully found its place as a cinematic legend."
"Red-Barracuda","8","0","1","19 January 2010"," Hallucinatory and enigmatic war film
","This is a review of the Redux version.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is a visually spectacular, cryptic movie that explores the psychological madness of war. This trip down the river is a metaphorical journey, from the gung-ho naivety of the surfing crewmen, via the leaderless and directionless soldiers who don't know what they are fighting for, to finally the battle-hardened madness epitomized by Colonel Kurtz in his Cambodian retreat. The assassin, Captain Willard, has clearly been chosen to hunt down and exterminate Kurtz on the basis that he too is of a similar mindset. He is an extremely damaged individual whose experiences in Vietnam have irrevocably altered his psyche, such that he is a cold and emotionless killing machine. His crew are identification figures for the audience. Clean represents the very young men who were destroyed in this extremely violent conflict and Chief is an example of the committed professional soldier. But perhaps Lance is more illustrative. He enters the story fresh-faced and naive, beginning his journey down the river on a surf board; soon he becomes a part of a massacre of civilians; before long he descends into madness. Lance's journey down the river is the metaphor for the experience of the average combat soldier in Vietnam; from enthusiasm via horror to mental breakdown.<br/><br/>Vittorio Storaro's photography is stunning throughout and really helps create the somewhat hallucinatory tone of the film. Apocalypse Now does not go for the realism of war that the likes of Platoon epitomized. Instead it adopts a slightly surrealistic approach, which works because the movie is more of an expression of the madness of war than an expose of the horrors that the troops had to suffer on the ground in Vietnam. This slightly more artistic manner may be off-putting to some who prefer their war films to be more realistic. Everything is very stylized, from the Flight of the Valkyries helicopter attack to the nightmarish Cambodian retreat of Colonel Kurtz. The film is also bookended by memorable sequences soundtracked to The Doors psychedelic classic 'The End'. The whole Vietnam experience is presented as a bit hyper-real.<br/><br/>The extended directors cut of Apocalypse Now – the Redux version – is an interesting but inferior alternative to the original release. It's debatable whether any of the new scenes actually improve the film. For the most part they break the inertia of the movie, knocking the pacing off, sometimes going into thematic cul-de-sacs or altering the tone unnecessarily. Although I think it's unquestionably a fascinating version with a considerable amount of new material to digest, it's also true that the shorter cut has more purpose and direction, and proves less is more. Nevertheless, I enjoy Redux as an optional, if lesser, alternative. So in summary, the definitive version is the original but Redux is still good. This is certainly a one-of-a-kind war movie and is yet another classic from the fertile 70's film-making period now referred to as New Hollywood."
"takx24","9","0","1","23 December 2009"," Simply Insanity
","In this movie, it demonstrates real insanity. I have never came across a film that portrayed such insanity. A movie with a great cast and a great story behind it. Starting off with Martin Sheen as a Special Force Captain who finally gets the mission he has been waiting for. A mission that involves killing an insane and deranged Colonel (Marlon Brando). With a great secondary cast which contains great modern day actors including Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper, and Frederic Forrest. Each actor in this movie shows outstanding talent, I was simply awed by the performance in this. Mainly what this movie portrays is the insanity war can make you experience. This film captures this in the best way possible, each character shows this in a different way, some of the minor characters such as the playboy models even show how insanity effects them. But the effects used in the film and the music in the background play a an important role in creating a certain tone for the movie, in which Jim Morrison does an amazing job at. The Doors song, The End, showed insanity and brutal mentality in it which played great in the film. Even as an opening song saying The End was a very clever and very entertaining aspect of the video. Overall this movie gives you an experience that no other video will ever give you, and experience that will take your breath away and will leave you thinking for weeks as I have been."
"Brawl_666","10","0","1","19 December 2009"," Rain of Madness
","Apocalypse Now is a nosedive into madness, both literally and metaphorically. A film made with sheer egoism, but in the spirit of uncompromising art.<br/><br/>We know that this film arose out of the director's attempt to adapt the modernist novella Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad. We also know that Mr. Coppola actually went to the Phillipines to shoot this film, that too just after the war had ended, and that the film was very nearly not made at all, because of immense production hassles which might have seemed obvious to a more sober (and less successful) director.<br/><br/>Being well acquainted with the novella, I can confidently say that the film version is NOT successful at articulating the ideas of the original work. Some of the dialog in the film - the briefing given to Willard, the photographer's rants, Kurtz's last lines - seem to be simply lifted from the novella and pasted onto the film, without any proper explanation or context. No Country For Old Men is a film adaptation of a book that is obstinately true to its source, articulates its ideas correctly, and also stands independently from the novel as a film on its own. If we didn't know the source for Apocalypse Now, there would be no way to make sense of the climax. Definitely not. In fact, the film is anticlimactic - the first two thirds are a surreal tour-de-force of visuals, sound and fury ; the last third is a disappointing damp squib.<br/><br/>I would say that this film demonstrates the limitations of cinema. In a play or a novel, the writer has all the freedom to conjure up whatever he likes, and it is all upto him, it is as he wills. Whereas a film relies on the co-operation of literally hundreds of artists and technicians, and rarely does the director, producer or writer have complete authority over the final product. For instance, everyone knows how Marlon Brando behaved on this project, and the climax' failure is more his fault than the director's - the film was doing fine precisely till Mr. Brando shows up. Also, literature has far more freedom of technique - for example, Heart of Darkness relies heavily on ambiguity to play up the readers' perception of Kurtz and his life - while film-making often has no comparable equal to many of these techniques.<br/><br/>The film is a must-see, however. Forgive me, thats putting it way too lightly. What it lacks in consistency and coherence, it more than makes up for in sheer visual and technical virtuosity. In an age when there was no CGI, no sophisticated camera rigs and steadicams, and no optical FX, Mr. Coppola and master cinematographer Vittorio Storaro conjured up a surreal montage of imagery that leaves one breathless, and nearly appalled in fact. The film seems to shuffle colors, textures, tones, light and shadow like a pack of cards. In particular there are two sequences - Willard's first encounter with the Air Cav, and the chopper assault on the village - that are more surreal than anything made by Kubrick or Fritz Lang or anybody. A chopper airlifting a bull for a meat roast, the choppers taking off and approaching the village with Kilgore kicking off Wagner at full blast, ""Hi tiger, bye tiger !"", the playboy bunnies' lap dance, colored smoke grenades, the flare attack, the ghostlike bedlam at the final bridge - these images indelibly stab your memory.<br/><br/>The additional footage in the REDUX version doesn't really add anything more to the original version, by way of greater insight or substance. The French plantation sequence has one comment on the Vietnam war that would not have been allowed back in 1979, had the US government had its way. For instance, Black Hawk Down was made entirely with US military support. Which is to say that the Pentagon suitably airbrushed the script, completely throwing out the Somali perspective (which the book included) and portraying the Somalis as the bad guys and the American troops (surprise surprise) as the good guys.<br/><br/>In short, far from perfect, but perfectly insane, and also perfectly unavoidable."

","""This is the end,beautiful friend. This is the end,my only friend,the end. Of our elaborate plans,the end. Of everything that stands,the end. No safety or surprise the end. I 'll never look in to your eyes...again... Lost in Roman,wilderness of pain,and all the children are insane. All the children are insane,waiting for a summer rain""-Jimmy Morison,The Doors-The end. Year is 1969 or 1970. Does n't matter. We hear sound of rotor blades and see jungle being burned by napalm. Then we see helicopters flying around, but helicopters blades noise turns to noise of blades of an air conditioner on a wall of a hotel room in Saigon. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is laying on a bed in some sort of mental brake down because he haven't seen any action for months. We see his story, why he is there. He is one kind of people dependent of adrenalin and his new mission is liberation from monotony driving him crazy.<br/><br/>But from this point,he will go on a journey of his life. His mission is to go to Cambodia, find renegade colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) and kill him. Colonel Kurtz ran out of any control and he is wagging his own war doing terrible crimes to local populations. We see his state of mind through captured recordings emitted from Cambodia. Captain Willard and his crew of four travel by rivers on a patrol boat through Vietnam before they enter Cambodia and on their journey we see their adventures and war madness. In my opinion ""Apocalypse Now"" is the best movie about Vietnam war,and not just war movie. This is film about duplicity of our society and most importantly, about Killer in our selves. You have to feel hatred and betrayal if you want to understand what made colonel Kurtz, intelligent and energetic man to become ""Ghost of the Jungle"". Movie offers most comprehensive picture about war in Southeast Asia. There is most famous scene of any Vietnam war movie when UH-1 ""Huey"" helicopters attack a village controlled by Vietcong. From their loud speakers they play ""Ride of the Valkyries"" of Richard Wagner,melody which i call ""Symphony of Destruction"". After village is captured colonel Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall) gives ""historic statement""-""I like the smell of napalm in the morning...Once we bombed one hill for 12 hours and found no body. I climbed on the hill just to smell that. It smells like victory"". This tells a lot about American approach to Vietnam war that ultimately led to victory of-Communists. Important scene in movie is conversation which they have in fictional French plantation in jungle (more then 10 years after French left). They talk about origins of war,about Vietminh (later Vietcong), about political betrayals and military mistakes. Their conversation is very interesting and useful in understanding the war. We see colonel's Kurtz perception of war. He says that ""as long as American soldiers come in tours,as long as rock and roll and cold beer are inescapable for their deployment they will remain war tourists and dilettantes"". He says that he could win war with two times less force but composed of dedicated people. But generals in Pentagon did not agree with him and after he killed four people working as double agents for Communists he ran away and formed his own forces to fight his own way.<br/><br/>When we see Playboy girls being brought to entertain soldiers and what happens, when we see fighting at the bridge that US forces defend from Vietcong and confusion in which they don't know who is their commander we understand why colonel Kurtz is right,even if he had gone mad and became mass murderer. Slowly we understand his state of mind, his mental pain. He talks about some village where they vaccinated children lots of years ago and after they left, guerillians cut of vaccinated hands of those children. When they returned and saw that,he suffered mental brake down. That changed him forever. He accepted that dedication necessary to commit such a terrible crime,it means mental strength of how he called them ""educated and moral men"". He became like his enemy. For local people and obsessed Photojournalist (Denis Hoper) he is greatest idol. Of colonel Willard 's crew of four only he and L.B.Johnson survived. Only reason for that is because Kurtz wanted them to stay alive. Kurtz wants somebody to kill him and exempt him from further suffering. He says to Willard-""You have a right to kill me,but you don't have a right to judge me"". So in the end Willard kills him and liberates him from his mental hell. Nobody tries to stop Willard and L.B.Johnson when they leave at the end. ""The horror,the horror"" final words in the movie tell us about duplicity of those who send people like Kurtz and Willard to do ""dirty job"" for them and then disclaim them.In their moral hypocrisy Kurtz is their own mirror and this is what they are afraid of. There is an old saying-""Don't blame the mirror if you are ugly"".But primarily last words in film tell us about our own dark side and what every one of us is capable of doing if put in a situation in which you lose your last regards. Side of us which we are afraid to admit that it even exists. Psychedelic perception of war and human soul. Both sides of what we are. Like when French woman says to Willard-""Don't you understand.There are two of you. One that kills,and the other that loves""."

","Bookended by firestorms, and featuring some of the most outlandish, unforgettable set-pieces in cinema at all points between - see the air cavalry attack to the strains of Wagner - Apocalypse Now is usually cited (with the usual dispensations for M.A.S.H. and Catch 22), as the film that most accurately portrays the utter insanity of war. Within this moral vacuum, to impose any kind of morality seems absurd, but that's the hypocrisy exposed here by Brando's doomed renegade Colonel Kurtz. Rarely has a Hollywood film worn its myriad literary and philosophical influences so heavily and proudly (it was penned by Nietzsche nut John Milius), while the story behind its making is as crazily compelling as the movie itself."
"mustaphai82","10","0","1","22 October 2009"," The Horror
","""The horror"" in the movie is not just a dialog but it pretty much sums up the message of the film. It is easy to start a war on the issue of communism or terrorism but the price tag of the war is too costly when compared to the issue. When Brando's character asks sheen's character who he actually is, sheen replies by saying that he is just a soldier to which Brando says. ""You're just an errand boy sent by the grocery clerks to collect the bill."" In th film Col. Kurtz was not a rouge officer. He was just someone who had hung his boots on war as he could not bear the horrors of it. His unit followed him which caused an upset for some high ranked army people back in the U.S. War was important for them no matter how horrendous the outcome was. Apocalypse now is a complex film and probably the best by Francis Ford Coppola."

","There aren't many films which run for over 3 hours and still keep you glued to them, this is one of them. Top-notch narration, breathtaking cinematography, excellent dialog and great characterization. well, I would say the characterization is what made this film what it is. The use of music in this movie is another astounding and contributing factor, Coppola picked variety of soundtracks, ranging from The Rolling stones to The Doors, and it gels beautifully with the narration. ultimately, this is a very daring, realistic piece of art, something which is totally absent in today's world of cinema. Watch it for Martin Sheen's effortless non-dramatic performance,Coppola's surrealistic camera-work, The Music-which gives this film a slight psychedelic feel, and of course MARLON BRANDO-You could give him virtually any damn role and he would nail it right out, that's Brando for you.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","10","0","1","11 September 2009"," Production elements are the prominent feature of Coppola's war masterpiece
","It's hard to argue that ""Apocalypse Now"" is anything but one of the top three war films if not the best ever made. There's just nothing wrong with it. Sure, there might be parts that don't resonate as well and the film certainly doesn't broadcast its messages in the most direct of ways, but confusion has nothing to say to the film's breathtaking visuals and impeccable post-production craftsmanship.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's non-""Godfather"" masterpiece is a Vietnam update of the classic Joseph Conrad novel ""Heart of Darkness."" Capt. Willard (Sheen) is ordered on a mission to travel up a river in Vietnam to find a former army Col. Walter Kurtz (Brando), who has gone ""rogue"" and taken charge of a local tribe. Willard is ordered to terminate Kurtz ... with extreme prejudice. With a band of ordinary soldiers, he travels upriver on a patrol boat on a mission that drastically changes his perspective.<br/><br/>It's funny, because what most people look for in movies -- great story, epiphany, great acting -- are not the strongest points of ""Apocalypse Now."" The level of practical effects, explosions and the sheer scale of some of the war sequences — all of which were pulled off on location in the Philippines —creates an unbelievably palpable experience for the viewer. The fact that D.P. Vittorio Storaro captures it all with stirring beauty in spite of the mayhem of this production and the undoubtedly testy elements makes his work one of the most remarkable achievements in cinematography of all time. The lights, the glare spots, the explosions and the jarring but effective changes in color palettes are so impressive that they tell a story in themselves.<br/><br/>Sound-wise, helicopter blades dominate the first significant chunk of this film and they begin to haunt you as a sound of war and danger, not to mention the challenges of mixing sound when that noise is so overpowering. The way it's all strung together is bound to be under- appreciated considering how much is going on and that the plot demands a lot of our attention.<br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" has a complex view of war that goes way beyond mere protest. In fact, it's not about war, but the inner struggle within the persons stuck in the middle of it. It's about the choices humans make in dealing with the complicated forces inside them beckoning them to do one or the other and how war puts an incredible and terrible strain on that process.<br/><br/>I watched ""Apocalypse Now Redux,"" the 2001 re-edit of the film including nearly 50 minutes extra footage. Having not seen the original but knowing which scenes were added, I think the extra footage makes a difference. Scenes involving the stranded Playmates and the French woman who takes kindly to Willard add a sensuality to the film that brings a new layer of meaning to the journey of Willard and the young PBR crew. It make it all the more apparent just how out of place these soldiers were in Vietnam and why the US couldn't ""win"" despite more than adequate numbers.<br/><br/>Although the production elements of the film are its crowning achievement, the script by John Milius and Coppola along with Michael Herr's narrative additions provide the bedrock. The way Willard's journey allows him to understand more about the man he's after and pushes him into Kurtz's shoes is one of the clearer points of the film and the turning points are all based around it. <br/><br/>Willard himself is an interesting protagonist in that with the exception of his first scene, we get no real sense of who he is. All his voice-over narration is expository with philosophical ponderings peppered in that set the stage for the greater moral questions that will come to a head once he finds Kurtz. Essentially, Willard is a stand in for us. Sheen's strength is that when we do see him on screen, his expressions our open-ended and allow us to project our own reactions to what happens in the film.<br/><br/>Once Kurtz arrives, we reach the film's poetic, philosophical core. Brando's shadowy presence punctuates the moral dialogue happening both on screen and in our minds as we process. Actors of his gravitas don't really exist anymore, and his legend maintains that mystique nearly four decades later. Nothing about his scenes disappoints — the combination of performance, writing and directing result in a climax that lives up to its hype and billing.<br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" makes not just a war statement or a political statement, but a human statement. The Vietnam War feels less essential to relaying its messages than is the case with most Vietnam War films. Human nature, morality and judgment play out in a cryptic, poetic dance on film, one that begins loud and journeys inward. Few films manage to brilliantly achieve both.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"

","The Redux version of Apocalypse Now is just way too long. There I said it.<br/><br/>The hellish road to get this film made is not a secret. The film turned out to be a success and people described it as the most honest depiction of war put to film, until Private Ryan came along that is.<br/><br/>My views on the film are different, because the only version I have seen is the Redux one. I apparently have a knack for watching the lesser version of supposedly great films. Redux is a good film, hurt by those added scenes, or so I'm told. I can say this though, what was cut for the original film should have remained on the cutting room floor. We get it, the French were there, did we really need to spend all that time with them.<br/><br/>Just when I found myself getting interested in the film it began to bore me, again I'm mainly talking about the French Plantation scene. This added nothing to the overall arc of the film and just stalled the viewer getting to the final climax. Suffice to say I'll place my money on saying this, Apocalypse Now is a better film if it were left alone.<br/><br/>It's a flawed film that inches on greatness. Memorable characters with real life problems? Awesome, I'm there. A cast that work well together and embody the characters? Even better. The film is epic and sits near the top of the important films of our history. Redux doesn't ruin a classic film, it just makes it boring.<br/><br/>Coppola is far from a favourite director of mine. I find his films overly long and tedious. He is talented, no doubt about that and deserves his place, but to me he should have left Apocalypse alone and not George Lucas it up. Pretentious or not, you decide.<br/><br/>I would still love to see the original though."
"valadas","8","0","1","18 July 2009"," Madness always and everywhere
","In this movie everybody is insane and not only Colonel Kurtz because any war is insane in itself and can only produce insanity. Values are so much degraded that we cannot distinguish between right and wrong anymore. It's the story of a captain who during the Vietnam war is sent on a special mission aimed at killing a former American colonel who went insane and left the army to go into the jungle in Cambodia where he formed a private army with local tribesmen and went on fighting the war on his own making lots of atrocities. Horror is more or less his motto and his obsession. Besides that he is also a poet and a philosopher and this feature of his discourse fits well in his behaviour. The movie develops itself by showing the course of the captain on his way to colonel Kurz's stronghold on a small Navy boat up a river through the jungle. During that course he and the crew of the boat find themselves involved in several happenings showing the true face of war, some violent and some delirious like for instance in the beginning the attack of helicopters against a Vietcong position by the sea, accompanied by Wagner's ""The Valkyria"" commanded by a crazy Cavalry colonel insisting of surfing on the sea while bombs explode everywhere around; another delirious scene is when the boat on its course arrives to an army post where there is a musical show for the soldiers performed by a few Playboy bunnies coming from USA who in the end have to seek sudden refuge in the helicopter that had brought them to avoid being molested if not raped. Another curious but full of meaning sequence is when the boat arrives to an old plantation owned by a French family who refuses to leave despite the war. The conversation at dinner between the family members and the captain is rather interesting to follow showing how differently French and Americans faced the war going on there. The movie is well directed and well performed by the whole cast and Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurz who appears only in the end is not better than the rest. Most sequences are really moving and touching and composed by impressive images. Perhaps the only flaw of the movie are the last scenes, a bit too theatrical in relation to its general atmosphere."

","When I watched this film for the first time at a reissue screening of the Redux cut, I was utterly devastated because of the never ending destruction within this picture. Everyone seemed to be dead inside, lost in fear and regret, gone crazy because of the experience of unspeakable things. I pitied them so much and learned to dislike war for what it is - it only causes devastation in any respect. Later I watched it again and again and still this film puts some kind of a spell on me. It took me some time to figure it all out. Well, there is this outstanding cinematography which I could never enjoy again in this quality. Combined with the editing all the pictures are more like music, very sensual and very attached to the characters' feelings and notions. Somehow a lot of the story is told by the images whereas the music is more subtle and only underlining what the images try to tell you. When it comes to storytelling, this film is very classical in a sense that we just follow Cpt. Willard's descriptions and we can only learn what he knows. So after a while we become his mate and begin to judge the things from his perspective. Well, he does some questionable things and we still do not know if he is really reliable, so we keep distance all the way. Finally, we are attracted and repelled by his weary appearance all the way, so here comes the suspense from. Really nice technique to keep the audience focused on the plot. Furthermore, the cast is incredibly talented - actually they do not even act in this film. They become as real and authentic as anybody. Due to their performances I felt like I was on this very boat, I was scared with them and I was happy for the mail to arrive. Maybe this is the great and outstanding nature of the film: That it feels so real. There is not so much deception in it - as a matter of fact everybody was in the jungle, everybody was fighting a little war there and everybody seemed to despair of their deepest horrors. I reckon that is what the film is all about: What we are looking for lies within and we cannot cover up what we are with shams and lies. To my mind this is film making in a very purified manner."

","I first saw this movie about 8 years back - and as I remember I had rented the movie after reading the rave reviews. I probably rushed through the movie and simply didn't get it (this was the original 1979 version)... I just thought that it was obscure and incoherent. Recently I visited my library and after looking through the available DVDs stopped when I saw a copy of AN - Redux. I hesitated for a long time before I decided to check it out... after all I did not want to waste 2-3 hours of my valuable holiday break. I watched the movie which lasted about 200 minutes and I did not miss a moment in time.<br/><br/>The beauty of the film was the screenplay that built up the image and stellar qualities of Col. Hurtz (Brando). Every moment in Willard's (Sheen) long journey was an opportunity to understand the intelligence and brilliance of Hurtz from a philosophical perspective.<br/><br/>Hurtz is a highly decorated All American hero set to have an illustrious career even before the war. But the excesses and more over the general ineptitude during the war breaks him beyond repair... Willard's journey is an effort to understand the general operating strategy (or non-strategy) and the excesses of a war terribly gone astray with the ultimate aim of understanding the horrors of the Vietnam war (or any war for that matter).<br/><br/>Robert Duvall is one of the stalwarts of American film industry and he most certainly did not disappoint in this one. He brilliantly portrayed the excesses during the Vietnam war. Kilgore (Duvall) is a very brave soldier who probably would stand-up and fight under any circumstance but the problem lies with the moral standards... the standout dialog was the utterance of ""savages"" by Kilgore for the potentially suicidal bomb attack by the Vietcong sympathizer when the savagery was probably initiated by Kilgore.<br/><br/>I have seem some comments here that did not put the redux version of the movie in its best light... but let me tell you that this version made a big difference for me to understand the film and the underlying message better... especially the French episode and the extended coverage with William Hurtz.<br/><br/>The gore and the surreal feeling is indescribable when Willard finally ends up in Hurtz's territory. The power wielded by Hurtz seems unreal but stands paramount amid his moral standing. The impending doom and inherent realization of the inevitable is palpable all along. Hurtz lets his assassin to linger long enough to let his reasoning and philosophy be understood before allowing to end it all. <br/><br/>Marlon Brando was magnificent as Hurtz and I cannot imagine anyone better for the role. If you have 3 hours to burn please do not hesitate to watch this masterpiece. This film will enrich you."

","Apocalypse Now (redux) was the first DVD movie I owned (my father bought it for me), I was originally looking for the DVD to assist me with my reading of 'heart of darkness'. What I found was very different and more mesmerizing than the novella itself, Apocalypse Now paved the way for my uncontrollable obsession with fine cinema.<br/><br/>Dark and mysterious, the cinematography is characteristic of Francis Ford Coppola. No other film I have viewed has ever bought such a hypnotic, bizarre and strange world to the screen as apocalypse now does. It is realistic visual and auditory art at its finest and if not admired for its honesty towards presenting the complications of a particular life, then surely apocalypse now must be held in high regard for the indescribable unique atmosphere it produces, in which the enraptured viewer cannot help but simply become encapsulated within from the very beginning to powerful ending.<br/><br/>You wont come across another movie that will hypnotize you in the way that apocalypse now does. Martin Sheen is simply brilliant, his character, Marlowe, is strong willed and torn simultaneously - yet Martin Sheen gives the infinitely complex character of Marlowe an undying consistency and commitment that comes through as stunning and forever interesting. You will feel privileged to watch a film in which the main character is just as unexplainable and astounding as the setting in which he interacts with, the duality is purely artistic, and through the interplay of rationality and savagery, suggests that there are no answers to the complications of life itself.<br/><br/>Although not a cult classic, apocalypse now is an indication of the capabilities and possibilities that cinema could offer for audiences, contemporary Hollywood cinema is failing in its ability to make its audience not just see, but actually FEEL strange new worlds and open doors of perception for individuals. It makes me sad to see the kind of movies that are released as of today, MOST of them are horrible junk movies with no point and no taste, movies which you know your money was never worth because they don't provoke thoughts or emotions within you to a sufficient extent.<br/><br/>Hats off to Apocalypse Now for what it is.

","Apocalypse Now (1979)<br/><br/>Number 1 - 1979<br/><br/>Top 4 - 1970s <br/><br/>Top 15 - All Time<br/><br/>""The Horror...The Horror""<br/><br/>""My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam"". Coppola's famous comment at the Cannes film festival, pretty much sums up this astonishing masterwork. No other film pushes the boundary so much, no other film is so probing about questions of morality, judgement, war, man and 'good' and 'evil'. After consideration, I do think this is the best Vietnam War film ever made, possibly the best war film ever made and definitely one of the very best films ever made.<br/><br/>It is as poetic and poignant as it is vulgar, violent and unsettling - Apocalypse Now is a cinematic rarity. Only a handful of other films are so impacting on the psyche and soul as this film. This may be the greatest film ever made.<br/><br/>Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's novella 'Heart of Darkness', Coppola extracts the skeleton of the book and adapts it to Vietnam. Starting in 1969 at the height of the war. Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) has returned to Saigon; a seasoned veteran, he is deeply troubled and apparently no longer fit for civilian life. A group of intelligence officers (G. D. Spradlin, Harrison Ford, and Jerry Ziesmer) approach him with a special mission: journey up the Nung River into the remote Cambodian jungle to find Colonel Walter E. Kurtz(Marlon Brando), a former member of the United States Army Special Forces.<br/><br/>They state that Kurtz, once considered a model officer and future general, has allegedly gone insane and is commanding a legion of his own Montagnard troops deep inside the forest in neutral Cambodia. Their claims are supported by very disturbing radio broadcasts and/or recordings made by Kurtz himself. Willard is ordered to undertake a mission to find Kurtz and terminate the Colonel's command ""with extreme prejudice."" While the storyline of the film is fiction (although the film is based in a very non-fiction war), the heart of the film is as true as it can get. Apocalypse Now is deep and draining, a rare masterpiece indeed.<br/><br/>The fact that this film did not win the 1979 Best Picture Oscar and Coppola was denied an Oscar for his bravura direction is a travesty indeed.<br/><br/>The definitive Vietnam film; breaks boundaries and sets new standards. The film drills into the depths of the soul, while exposing the insane degeneration of humanity in Vietnam - breathtaking cinema. <br/><br/>""This may be the greatest film ever made"" <br/><br/>10/10"

","Wow. After seeing Apocalypse Now (redux version) i was left amazed. Shocked in a good way. What i'd heard about the 'Nam war epic led me to believe this film would be Napalm strikes and Huey's ahoy. Actually, i wouldn't have minded that.<br/><br/>But everything changed after viewing the opening credits. The brilliant treeline shot couldn't have had more atmosphere. The Doors 'The End' has since become one of favorites. And then we're hit with an excellent monologue by Martin Sheen, brilliant but disturbing. As soon as Capt. Willard is given his mission to terminate Kurtz, the film destroys all war-film convention; spearheading the viewer down a river of madness. The fighting sequences are far and few between, but all were visions of perfection. When the VC aren't shooting, the film still doesn't lose any of its tone. The haunting scenery leaves nothing to be desired in the cinematography department. The script is near perfection. And the acting is second to none. Sheen remains solid throughout, perfectly depicting his gradual descent into madness. Robert Duvall's portrayal of Kilgoare is brilliant for the time he is on. From the second he hits play on the 'Ride of the Valkyries' you know your in for a treat. The Pibber crew all put in great solid performances. A real standout is Marlon Brando. I can't help but picture the look on Francis Ford Cuppola's face when Brando showed up 40kgs overweight and without knowing his lines. Despite the apparent lack of preparedness by Brando, he still does a wonderful job as Kurtz, the insane military prodigy.<br/><br/>Now for the unfortunate cons. Some of the redux additions are great, whilst there are some very cringe worthy new scenes. The addition of the Playboy bunnies scene at the abandoned medical camp is useless. It adds nothing to anything, and almost completely destroys the wonderful mood set up by the film entirely. Another useless input is the French plantation sequence. Not that bad if you think about it, but half an hour crapping on about the French position on the war is ridiculous. Cut in half, then squeezed further, it may have worked. But it does a similar job of letting the films atmosphere slip at an important moment.<br/><br/>Despite some shaky scenes, and the useless crap shoved in by Cuppola for the redux version, Apocalypse Now delivers on every front. Everything just seems right about it. It is an emotional struggle at the best of times, but i will no doubt leave you thinking long after you've seen it. If you want to watch this expecting a die hard action film, think again. YES the action is brilliant. But this film is oh so much more than a war film. It will toy with your mind, screw it up, and ship it home in a body bag. But you HAVE to see it. And once you do, i guarantee, you too will love the smell of napalm in the morning."

","Apocalypse Now"" was originally 200 hours of footage shot in the Philippines over the course of 16 months. Director Francis Ford Coppola was responsible for funding several million dollars for the film during financially difficult times. On the set, the cast faced many set backs, including the destruction of sets during the monsoon season and the fact that helicopters that they were using to film with were called back by the government to be used in actual combat. Marlon Brando appeared on the set overweight to play a character written as noticeably underweight. Brando also had not read the script or the novella that it was based on and after receiving a million dollar advance, he at first refused to film. Martin Sheen was an alcoholic during shooting and during an opening scene of intoxication he is actually inebriated and his actions were improvised. He also suffered a life-threatening heart attack on set. During the filming of the movie, Coppola faced financial difficulty, marital strain and mental deterioration. Throughout filming, he threatened to commit suicide on three occasions and lost 100 pounds. Following the completion of shooting the movie took an additional year to edit. However, despite setbacks upon release the film grossed over 100 million dollars at the box office and earned two academy awards for best cinematography and score along with six other Oscar nominations. <br/><br/>The dictionary gives two definitions of apocalypse ""a prophetic revelation, especially concerning a cataclysm in which the forces of good permanently triumph over the forces of evil"" and ""any universal or widespread destruction or disaster: the apocalypse of nuclear war"". ""Apocalypse Now"" shows the viewer not only the ugliness and chaos of war but also the darkness of the human heart. It leaves the viewer to question did good truly triumph over evil? Captain Willard is a special agent ordered to ""exterminate with extreme prejudice"". He is told to assassinate Colonel Kurtz who has countered the American army and is a murderer. The movie follows Willard's character further and further down the river with four others on the boat each trying to deal with the horrors of a questionable war. As the film progresses you see senseless killing and the deterioration of the mental health of soldiers in an unimaginable situation. The characters travel further and further from regular civilization and deeper into the heart of darkness.<br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" begins with the haunting voice of Jim Morrison ""All the children are insane, waiting for the summer rain"" while featuring images of senseless destruction the Vietnam War. This film is an artistic triumph, featuring gripping, unforgettable sequences and incredible cinematography. The film has hallucinatory images of a wasteland created by violence coupled with a lack of light, which truly takes you into the heart of darkness. It not only shows the violence and absurdity of war but also is a study of man. The film is intended for interpretation with subtext and metaphors, which leave the audience thinking when the credits roll.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie, and consider it well worth the time. ""Apocalypse Now"" is of historical importance and features great characters. This movie greatly captured the descent of man into madness, and the horrors of war. This film was hard hitting, with scenes that were not easy to watch, in fact, at times, the viewer may wish to look away, but it is this that adds to the film and makes it more of a cinematic accomplishment. As Francis Ford Coppola said ""this film isn't about Vietnam, this film is Vietnam."""

","""Apocalypse Now"" could very well be considered Francis Ford Coppola's ""Hells Angels."" Quite possibly anything that could have prevented the film to continue shooting happened. In the jungles of the Philippines, people got sick, people got hurt, and people got sent home. The story of ""Apocalypse Now"" is that of pure insanity. In the beginning of the film when Martin Sheen (Captain Willard) is dispatched by some higher ups in the army to go on a secret mission to assassinate a renegade Colonel everyone is relatively sane. As Coppola's epic film progresses and grows, so does the insanity of everyone on the boat taking Martin Sheen's character up river. Deeper and deeper into the jungle they go, the further away from ""society"" they get and the more primitive things become to them. Starting out with modern warfare such as napalm, planes, and machine guns quickly turn into rocks, arrows and spears. Willard narrates most of the movie as he reads his mission briefs or scouts upcoming bends in the river. Set on his mission Willard keeps in mind what he is after, thus making him more immune to the disease of insanity, whereas, his shipmates have no idea why they are going up river and what they are getting themselves into, hence why they start to lose it before Captain Willard. When they finally reach the camp of Colonel Kurtz, they find that the natives love him and his wisdom. Mostly because they probably haven't been subjected to such power before he came along. By the time the deed is done, Willard has become so immersed into his character of this guy who is suppose to kill this other guy, that he is completely unfazed by what he does and walks slowly back to his boat and goes home."
"citizenchris","9","0","1","25 August 2008"," it is not a war film nor is it necessarily a Vietnam war film
","Apocalypse Now (redux) 8-25-08<br/><br/>I'll begin this comment by saying that I don't find this film to be either of the things its often prescribed to be...that is to say that it is not a war film nor is it necessarily a Vietnam war film. Yes the film narrative takes place during a war more specifically the American conflict in Vietnam but it it about neither of those things specifically. It is to my way of thinking a film about our human tendency towards war and how utterly hypocritical said institution is viewed in our modern world. The film is hallucinatory to the point of being almost dream like. It is both pensive and insane. The narrative is more akin to a fairy story than any war film. Alice and Wonderland comes to mind...Willard following the white rabbit down the river to meet the red queen that is Kurtz all the while running into some colorful characters. Its impossible for me to think about this remarkable film with out thinking of two actors and how completely essential components they are to making this one of my all time favorite films. Martin Sheen is a miracle in this film, words cant describe how f^%$# amazing he is. On screen he is both pensive and brooding but its is his narration that is utterly brilliant and it is this narration that glues the myriad facets of this film in place. In many ways Mr. Sheen is Apocalypse Now but he is not the star. The star of this picture is a man who appears on screen only briefly towards the end but whose presence carved out a place in my conscience. That man is Marlon Brando. He is the star for so many reasons not the least of which is that the whole god d%$# thing is about his character. We spend what feels like a week hearing about this guy, the whole film is building to this climax that will surely disappoint. Not only did it exceed what I was expecting but it completely overshadowed the three plus hours that preceded it. If I were to muster any complaints about this film is would perhaps be its pace...it feels like a long film. The version of the film I viewed had it split between two discs and this is appropriate as one might want to take a break. Though I certainly prefer the film in this longer version (redux being a more recent extended cut of the film) and would not want to see anything excised from the film so take my complaint with a grain of salt."

","Another movie genre which I had decided to keep away from was that of war movies. My idea of a war movie is that of just blood and gore and directors and producers taking advantage of a problem that gets more critical every day. Some of these movies might just suit this description, but Apocalypse Now does not.<br/><br/>I had previously become familiar with Francis Ford Coppola's work on his Godfather movies, both of them which I greatly enjoyed. This time, along with John Milius, Coppola created a script for Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", hired the cast and crew, and flew over to the Pacific, to start filming what will end up in more than eight hours in footage of Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>The story basically deals with Captain Willard being assigned on a secret mission to hunt down Coronel Kurtz, an ex-American soldier charged of murder, and who seems to have lost his mind and is worshiped by the native Cambodians as a god.<br/><br/>Actors would have killed in order to get one of the main character roles. There are many interesting ones, very complex characters; starting by Coronel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando, whose story would be revealed by Captain Willard as the movie goes by. Willard, played by Martin Sheen seems to have a high sense of responsibility in completing his mission, but as the story develops he becomes more convinced of the unnecessarily battle. And finally there is the supporting role of Robert Duvall as Colonel Kilgore. That is, without mentioning the guys who accompanied Willard, their different ages and personalities and the problems that this differences cause.<br/><br/>The redux edition features a new movie cut, which will take through four hours of great landscape shots of the Oriental region, comedic moments, and situations which will portrait the whole context of the Vietnam War. Don't be scared by its running time, I'm not going to say its fast-going, but it will keep you seated enough time to watch it in one try.<br/><br/>This is clearly an anti-war movie, and when the Pentagon found about this, they started a censorship campaign which resulted in the movie's failure at the Oscars. But in the end, time has given reason to Apocalypse Now, making it one of those movies every so-called movie lover must watch."

","My youngest daughter met Martin Sheen today, which prompted me to file this review of one of Hollywood's greatest movies. Based on Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, APOCALYPSE NOW follows Army captain Martin Sheen into the jungles of Southeast Asia as he searches for renegade colonel Marlon Brando, who has gone native and frankly stark raving mad. Sheen gets far more than he bargained for when he finally finds Brando. Along the way, Sheen encounters a real cowboy of a lieutenant colonel played by a young Robert Duvall, who utters the film's classic line, ""How I love the smell of napalm in the morning."" Sheen had a heart attack while filming this massive epic in the Philippines. Frederic Forrest, a great character actor perhaps best known as the crazy military goods store owner in FALLING DOWN, has a plum role as the doomed ""Chef."" The film is absolutely amazing and can never be duplicated or equaled. Brando was in his glory as a larger-than-life madman, and Sheen justifiably became one of Hollywood's biggest stars after this. A must-see, especially for those of you who, like my kid, only know Sheen from THE DEPARTED."

","Saw this on one of our dedicated film channels a couple of days ago for the first time since around 1991. The first time I saw it, ""not another Vietnam war movie"" crossed my mind because this subject got saturation coverage from Hollywood up until around the end of the cold war. Pretty much everything was covered by films such as this one, Hamburger Hill, The Deerhunter, Platoon, Good Morning Vietnam, Born on the Fourth of July etc. So what makes ""Apocalypse Now"" stand out?<br/><br/>1) Outstanding acting. Particularly Martin Sheen who portrays Captain Willard to perfection, resisting any temptation to overplay his character but instead allowing the audience to travel into the jungle with Willard and share his experience as he journeys into an abyss. The ensemble cast all play their parts to perfection as well, Robert Duvall's comic book turn as Lt Colonel Kilgore being especially memorable.<br/><br/>2) Fantastic cinematography. The use of imagery is amazing, as almost every visual is memorable but also in context of the story meaning the viewer is kept interested throughout. This is the only way to watch a 2 1/2 hour film (or the unofficial cut of nearly 5 hours) without becoming twitchy.<br/><br/>3) Great editing. I didn't realise the original length until I wrote this review because when watching AN it was obvious huge chunks had been taken out. My guess is editor Walter Murch got rid of lots of spoken dialogue and kept in the imagery. Because of 1) and 2) this works just fine. We don't need to know the whole mechanics of how Willard winds up in the jungle or see every scene, just what's needed.<br/><br/>4) The Accidents Work! Marlon Brando was far too fat to play a special forces colonel and looks like he's reading his lines off cue cards in every scene. However, shooting Kurtz in dark shadows hides these flaws and turns Brando's performance into a masterpiece. Anything that works....<br/><br/>5) Inspires imitation Writing this and I now realise all the other Vietnam films must have been inspired by AN as all bar The Deerhunter came afterwards!<br/><br/>Finally, Apocalypse Now has a fantastic and rarely achieved quality: it won't date. Usually great films get mixed reviews initially and then gradually seep into people's consciousness over many years and finally top the ""Greatest Films"" charts of sites like IMDb. People will still be moved by this artwork in 2079, 2179 and even 3079."

He is joined by a small crew consisting of Chief Phillips (Albert Hall), Chef (Frederic Forrest), Clean (Laurence Fishburne), and Lance (Sam Bottoms). As they get closer to their destination, they start to run into crazier and crazier people. Eventually meeting the king of crazy himself.<br/><br/>The acting here was all great. Martin Sheen was excellent as Willard. Robert Duvall was entertaining as the slightly insane Col. Kilgore. A young Laurence Fishburne gave a great performance as Clean. Frederic Forrest was fun to watch as Chef. Albert Hall was good as Chief Phillips. Sam Bottoms was also very good as Lance. Dennis Hopper was very good as the increasingly insane Photojournalist. Harrison Ford was great in the small role of Colonel Lucas. And Marlon Brando was pretty good as Kurtz, not quite his best part ever though.<br/><br/>The story was pretty dark.

And when Brando finally makes his appearance, the film becomes a philosophical search for a resolution to the insoluble mysteries of madness and evil. I've rarely seen a film that is so well made. Vittorio Storaro's cinematography is way ahead of its time and the sound AND editing by Walter Murch and company is amazing. Major props to Coppola for his brilliant direction and the cast and the acting couldn't be better. Awesome sequences such as the electrifying opening montage played to The Doors' The End, the epic and breathtaking Ride of Valkyries helicopter attack sequence, the Duvall's ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning"" speech"" (Duvall almost steals the entire film) , the the terrifying firefight scenes, Dennis Hopper's crazy photojournalist, the spellbinding scene where Brando and Sheen finally meet, Brando's thoughts on horror, and the climax where Sheen finally kills Kurtz once again to The End.

I liked it well enough but I guess it's one of those movies that I will be content only seeing once, well at least the Redux. I need to check out the original because I hear it's much better.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen is awesome and so is everybody else, especially Laurence Fishburne who I was surprised to see. I haven't seen a ton of Coppolla's films but I will try to catch up one his work, he did a great job directing this movie. I liked the story as I loved Heart of Darkness and I really like what it has to say about war. It also shows how absurd war can be at times, I'm talking about the playboy bunny scene and the surfers. I'm glad I saw it but I don't know if I will again.<br/><br/>Everybody should see this movies because of its status in the film world. But don't make the mistake I did, see the theatrical version first."

","Diane and I watched this movie last night many years after our first viewing when it was initially released and we both were almost incredulous at the complexity, power and brilliance of the movie. I had thought that Deer Hunter was the most important and powerful movie to originate from the Vietnam War but after last night I realise that I was badly mistaken. In a way I did not understand that it was possible to make a movie as powerful as Apocalypse Now; I did not realise that one person could assemble the actors and the script and select the camera shots that could produce what we watched last night.<br/><br/>Beyond the superb movie making, there is the consideration about the film's alleged anti-Americanism because of the surreal overview of the war. Personally, from my reading and absorption of war visuals, I found the movie all too real. Of course Coppolla exaggerated, massively, but this exaggeration was based on the truth of this extraordinarily nasty war. As crazy as he made events look, read a book called ""Bloods-An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans"" and I am sure you will finish it thinking that Apocalypse Now was almost a fairy tale. Maybe many veterans do not want to admit to themselves the horrors that America inflicted on an innocent people but it did happen. <br/><br/>I am not a complete neophyte with cinema although I do confess to a huge lack regarding the technicalities and subtleties of the movie making process; however, after having said this even I was amazed at the quality of each individual scene which, under a lesser hand, could have constituted an entire movie project on its own. The brilliance of the scene of Duval's village attack, the French dinner party and the final cataclysm with Kurtz each of which has total standalone brilliance is beyond us mere humans to appreciate.<br/><br/>Is it the century's best?"
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","0","1","31 December 2007"," A cinematic masterpiece... easily Coppola's best.
","More than twenty-five years on since it's initial cinema release, Apocalypse Now still stands as one of the most powerful and hypnotic visionary depictions of the madness of war ever committed to film, with director Francis Ford Coppola using Joseph Conrad's legendary tome Heart of Darkness as the metaphorical backbone to this surreal, episodic and hallucinogenic rumination on man's capacity for tyranny, and his ultimate search for redemption.<br/><br/>The basic crux of the story remains simple, with Coppola drawing on certain elements from the aforementioned Heart of Darkness, as well as various influences from the classic Werner Herzog film, Aguirre, the Wrath of God (in which Klaus Kinski's jungle trip mirrors that of the soldiers here) to give weight to his own cinematic ideas, manifested here by the two warring characters of Kurtz and Willard. Unlike the majority of Vietnam related films (like the Dear Hunter, Platoon, Casualties of War and Full Metal Jacket, to name the most obvious) Coppola's film relegates the technical and factual aspects of warfare and the period in which the film is set to the background, in order to more closely examine the relationship between the soldiers (particularly the above-mentioned Willard and Kurtz) in this intense and to some extent dreamlike situation. Coppola's depiction of 'Nam bares no similarity to those films listed above... with his Vietnam becoming a place where surf-mad soldiers bombard villages from helicopters to the piercing strains of Wagner; playboy bunnies entertain the troops in the middle of the jungle; out-posts are attacked at night by unseen mercenaries, whilst monotonous carnival music plays incessantly in the background; whilst the whole climax of the film juxtaposes rock music, arcane philosophy, decapitation and the ritualistic slaughter of a bull.<br/><br/>Coppola's visuals - aided by cinematographer Vitorrio Storaro, production designer Dean Tavourlarus, and editor/sound designer Walter Murch - are powerful and lingering, with the film offering up a number of astounding sequences and set-pieces (as well as some of the standouts listed above, the opening scene - which finds Willard freaking out to the sound of the Doors in a Saigon hotel room, whilst superimposed images of napalm explosions and juxtapositions of ceiling fans and helicopter rotor-blades drift across the screen - is a great way to introduce the sense of madness and escalating atmosphere that will build throughout the film). Much like the aforementioned Aguirre, Apocalypse Now has a great narrative momentum, with Coppola and co-writer John Millius (...though apparently, much of his contributions were scaled down) keeping the film moving forwards, much like the soldiers in the boat, by offering up a strong and enticing mixture of surreal visions, philosophical discussions, and abrasive action.<br/><br/>It's probably the only film to take the idea of ""the madness of war"" and makes the description a reality, with the filmmakers evoking a Vietnam that is more like a carnival freak-show than something approaching the hyper-real depictions of combat found in Oliver Stone's Vietnam trilogy (Platoon, Born of the Fourth of July and Heaven & Earth). Some have, and indeed, still, criticise the final act of the film, in which Martin Sheen's no-nonsense Willard finally comes face-to-face with Marlon Brando's barmy colonel Kurtz, in which the king of method acting turned up over-weight, moody and baring a serious grudge against the director and his co-stars. Regardless of this, I think Brando's performance is exceptional, as great as his portrayals in films like Streetcar Named Desire, On The Waterfront, The Godfather and Last Tango In Paris, as he sits hunched over in the shadows, stroking his shaven head and mumbling about T.S. Eliot and the horrors of militaristic genocide.<br/><br/>His appearance in the film is as iconic as the scene with Robert Duvall on the beach, with that oft-quoted line ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning... smells like... victory"" and is as tense and as surreal as any of the film's major (for lack of a better word) action scenes. The hallucinogenic atmosphere established throughout ties in with another Herzog film, Heart of Glass, and would be an influence on the Russian anti-war drama, Come And See, which is probably more important than Coppola's film... though it's certainly less accessible, and a lot more abrasive. Everything about this film is perfectly judged... from the production design, location work, sound design and music (the two are really integrated seamlessly here) and the heavily-colour-tinted cinematography (...getting away from the documentary-like approach of war favoured by many other filmmakers in favour or something more ethereal).<br/><br/>I'm not that familiar with the re-cut ""redux"" version, released in 2001... being much too attached to this version after years of watching it as a teenage. Also, as someone else pointed out, it's much easier to trust the directorial instincts of the man who just made The Godfather and The Conversation... but not so easy to trust the instincts of the hack that made Jack, and The Rainmaker. Apocalypse Now, in it's original 1979 version, more than stands up as one of the greatest films of the 20th century...blending together the gorgeous, hypnotic transcendence of Storaro's cinematography and Coppola's idiosyncratic take on warfare, with some startling moments of real-horror, philosophy, reflection and character."
"zolaaar","8","0","1","7 December 2007"," Heart of Darkness
","The film is considered to be the most remarkable account of the experiences in the Vietnam war and one of the best war movies ever. It tells the story of Joseph Conrad's novel ""Heart Of Darkness"" of an American officer, who gets the order to ride up the Mekong and liquidate an outrageous colonel. On his journey he witnesses the annihilation of the Vietnamese society, while the American army collectively degenerates into madness, absurdity, and horror. Because of that experience the officer becomes aware of the reasons of the American defeat. The movie shows the Vietnam war as a collective experience of the evil within the scope of the wide crusade against communism.<br/><br/>""Apocalypse Now"" is a film that works on so many different levels. On the one side, it is a completely new valuation of the role of the USA in the Vietnam war, its goals and the way how the war was fought. On the other side, it is a very personal movie which is realistic in its presentation of the futility of war. The viewer dwells into the story and still is reminded of what you always have to remember: That war means hell and horror and must be prevented at all events."

","Exciting, groundbreaking, epic, and that's just the opening scene I'm talking about. The Doors playing over a wall of fire, it can't really be beat. This is the movie that makes so many other Vietnam movies redundant. There are no heroes, there is no patriotism, there's just a group of people in a situation they really don't want to be in. And they really want to go home. This is an anti-war movie more than anything. There are no guns and explosions, well there are, but this is a war drama more than an action movie. The pace is pretty slow, making room for a lot of beautiful cinematography. Man this movie looks great. Those shots of their boat hovering over the water, bathing in the sun, so powerful. This movie is also about anticipation. Who is this Kurz? The viewer just really wants to know. The last half hour has a really great atmosphere to it.

A FILMMAKER'S APOCALYPSE was chock full of newsworthy bits, as was the REDUX (which, with the exception of the ghostly French Plantation sequence, only proved that Coppola had been right all along to excise the scenes he'd excised).

"johnnyboyz","10","0","1","22 August 2007"," A 'road movie' war film that incorporates just about everything you'd want in both genres and much more.
","Apocalypse Now is a great film full of great things. People compare it to Saving Private Ryan as the best war film of all time and although I probably prefer Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now is still up there amongst it. A reoccurring quote from Apocalypse Now towards its dramatic concluding twenty minutes is 'the horror' and what a great thematic quote to use, not only as the film's tagline but also as a statement to sum up what goes on in Apocalypse Now and to sum up the Vietnam War in general. Apocalypse Now has a theme already and thus; scores points with me before it's even begun.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is just full of the basics done brilliantly. The cinematography, the mise-en-scene, the atmosphere, the voiceovers powered by the screenplay  they all combine in pretty much every scene and deliver on such a level, it's so very difficult not to like. It truly sucks you into the film and into Vietnam. What the backbone of Apocalypse Now is that makes it so great is that its story is that of a single line journey; Apocalypse Now is a war based 'road movie' since it takes place down one stretch of track (a river) and involves the protagonist Benjamin Willard (Sheen) and his 'crew' getting into all sorts of conflict and adventures which is something that these sorts of films have that I just love.<br/><br/>When people think of Vietnam films, they think of the jungle and jungle warfare. Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and We Were Soldiers are all acclaimed in their own right but Apocalypse Now moves away from the jungle in a way that feels so refreshing and new, it makes for fantastic viewing. There is so much to read out of this film, it's incredible. The first 'taste' of warfare we get is presented to us much like it is in Saving Private Ryan although it doesn't come as soon: it's presented in a state of absolute chaos. We have several choppers flying along, music blaring out, cut to the village they're about to attack: calm and peaceful until the American's arrive: more chaos, shouting, gunfire, orders being passed down, destroyed buildings bridges and cars as well as distressed villagers. What makes them even greater then what they actually start out as is when the American's actually start to struggle in their fight as a chopper is destroyed and someone is brutally injured in the fire fight. Epic, truly epic and a fantastic introduction to the warfare to expect.<br/><br/>The journey not only of discovery but of self discovery Willard undergoes in fascinating in its own right. The numerous incidences involving things like: the supply boat they search, the bridge checkpoint they reach and the trench encounter as well as the ambush from the jungle they suffer and the scene after that when someone is lying there dead whilst a tape from home plays over a shot of their corpse  it's all ingenious film-making. One such scene I loved was following the girlie show the Americans have that descends into chaos, Willard states that the Vietcong's idea of nightly entertainment probably consists of 'a bowl of rice and something nice and simple'. I feel this is a statement of how something that should have gone so straightforward (a girlie show and the winning of the Vietnam war) can quickly get really out of hand and thus, turn into a mess.<br/><br/>If there is a criticism, then it occurs during the final act of Apocalypse Now. The film goes from a war film with a mission and a plan to a much darker, more disturbing display of a character gone mad (Kurtz  Brando) in a dystopia full of strange characters, disorientating settings and a cow getting hacked up but this is in no way a major criticism. The film does slow down slightly when Willard is caged and spoken to through the character of a photojournalist (Hopper) and Kurtz just seems to be on the brink of a philosophical breakthrough one minute but spouting rubbish the next in almost all of his scenes. The payoff, however, as the mission reaches its climax is superb.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that I really enjoyed Apocalypse Now and although Kramer vs. Kramer is still great; how this and Saving Private Ryan lost out on the best picture awards in their respective years is still beyond me."
"slokes","9","0","1","18 August 2007"," The Jungle Is Giving The Orders Now
","""Apocalypse Now"" is one of the most exciting classics in American film, a singular work of art offering both benediction and indictment. Benediction for those who found themselves suffering and dying through the futility that was the Vietnam War. Indictment of those like me who watch its vividly horrifying yet magnetic depiction of man's inhumanity to man and come away asking: ""Yes, but what about that poor puppy?""<br/><br/>Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is an airborne intelligence officer holed up in a Saigon hotel room, his life a wreck as he awaits an order, any order, to rouse him from his soul-killing lethargy. One comes in the form of a mission to track down renegade Special Forces Col. Kurtz, no longer taking orders from the Pentagon as he prosecutes his own war.<br/><br/>""Terminate the colonel's command, sir?""<br/><br/>""Terminate with extreme prejudice.""<br/><br/>Everyone talks about the killer beginning, with good reason. Everything from Willard's opening remarks about still being in Saigon to a scene aboard a sampan 90 minutes later is simply remarkable. Every time I watch it, I'm blown away again by some element of it. The great dialogue (""Charging a guy for murder in this place was like giving out speeding tickets at the Indy 500""), the hellacious acting (Sheen is so outstanding in his opening breakdown scene that he hardly needs to twitch a face muscle for the rest of the film and we're still with him all the way), the editing (the attack on the Vietnamese village is so intense it makes the accompanying Wagner music sound like the Archies.)<br/><br/>None of the three elements mentioned above won an Oscar. Editor Walter Murch did win one for the sound of the film, but otherwise this was something of a Waterloo for director Francis Ford Coppola, at least at the time. It took a while for people to recognize ""Apocalypse Now"" for the masterpiece it is.<br/><br/>Two reasons for that, I think. One is that the film is incredibly dense and ambitious, really requiring video and cable for its greatness to sink in, as was the case with ""The Right Stuff"". The other is an ending that, while good by itself, is a marked letdown from all that came before. When we meet Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), it's clear he's not equal to the build-up. No one can be, but he decidedly isn't. After hearing him billed as the one American officer successfully outfighting the Viet Cong, we meet instead an overweight pundit who holds court in a kind of Woodstock with weaponry, reading high poetry and declaiming the use of napalm as if Brando hijacked his character with his own legendary leftism.<br/><br/>But there are too many majestic sequences to carp about that very long. Coppola and co-screenwriter John Milius set up the helicopter attack in such a way we root for the Americans though we are painfully aware that the village they are attacking contains women and children. Robert Duvall, sensational as an Air Cav commander named Kilgore, calmly sips coffee as ack-ack flies around his copter cabin. The first time you see it, you're amazed at his cool. Then you realize why shouldn't he be cool? He's holding all the chips. The real heroes are the ones shooting at him.<br/><br/>The sampan scene (that introduces the puppy) shows the Americans in an even worse light, yet the anxiety of the Navy personnel in the sequence is understandable. Nothing is glorified, but the liberal anti-war message is more subtle than we are used to seeing from Hollywood, and thus more effective.<br/><br/>Everything about ""Apocalypse Now"" is more effective. So what if it didn't win any Oscars, or hold its singular greatness all the way up to the end? What it gives us is more than enough. It's probably too much for many people even today. But that's what's so great about it."

","Apocalypse Now, perfect example of ""War is hell"", you'll know what i mean when you see it. I think it's a great idea, a story of a young soldier traveling with a boat through 'Nam, looking for some veteran. Francis Ford Coppola does great movies, but i have to say this movie was very weird, OK i admit it, i was very tired when i watched it, it was finished at 2:am so i guess i wasn't paying full attention to the movie. But some things catch my mind, as i wrote before, this movie really shows the words ""War is hell"". Not to many battle scenes in this one either (wich usually gets boring after 3 mins or so..), instead it shows how the soldiers lived and behaved under the Vietnam war. How they got mad and did everything to survive, the real hate against the Vietcong. Martin Sheen is great in this one. <br/><br/>I noticed one thing though, A young Harrison Ford appears. And Coppola and George Lucas was arguing about something, i don't know, but anyway: In the very short scene where Harrison Ford is in, you can see small letters on his name tag pronouncing: G.Lucas Just a funny easter egg....<br/><br/>A little resumé of the movie: Great, A bit weird 8/10"

","This has to be the greatest Vietnam movie ever made. Its not a surprise that the director of The Godfather I and II made again another great epic. The most memorable scene in the movie has to be the opening scene of the movie.<br/><br/>The opening scene begins with just a shot of the Vietnamesse jungle with a helicopter going around the jungle. Then all the sudden napalm all over the jungle, with ""The End"" by the Doors playing, that is just an incredible scene. Then again it comes to no surprise that Francis Ford Coppola has yet another great opening scene. <br/><br/>The story is simple. Its about a Sargent Willard getting a mission to terminate a renegade Colonel named Walter E. Kurtz(Brando). The whole movie sets in the Vietnamese river, Williard is with U.S. army sailors. The names of the sailors are Lance, Mr. CLean. Chef and Chief Phillips. During the whole time Williard is reading dossiers of Kurtz including records he set in his academy. Willard is impressed of Kurtz's records and does not know why the U.S. army wants him killed. With Chief Phillps and Mr. CLean dead, Chef, Lance, and Williard go to their destination. Willard gets caught and he is impressed with the wisdom that Kurtz has. Then he now realizes why they want Kurtz dead. It's a human feeling, a temptation to be God.<br/><br/>This movie is my top 10 period. Brando's acting is just awesome.

","From my point of view out of all the movies about Vietnam, and there is really a lot of them, this is the best. With its surrealistic approach, it goes a different way than the Vietnam films at that time did. A way that lets the viewer see the absurdity of war even clearer. A war like this can never produce anything good. Soldiers go (or have to go) to a foreign country, they see a culture, which they are not trying to understand, because they feel superior. That's what they have been told: ""We are the civilized modern humans, these are uncivilized savages."" The soldiers kill or get killed. And for what? That's what Marlon Brando's character General Kurtz means, when he says he's seen ""the horror"". ""Apocalypse Now"" is the most philosophical influenced Vietnam war movie with elements from many different genres, the horror film among them. A few words to the Redux version: It's a little bit less dark, a little bit less horror, a lot more of politics. It makes not a better film, but a different one. But still excellent."

","There is not much more you can say about Apocalypse Now. Some people on the message boards are talking about which scenes in the movie affected them the most. Me, I can't name just one scene because there were so many. I'll name a few though. The first scene with Kurtz was memorable, the helicopters coming in to attack while Flight of The Valkeryes is playing is another. The Vietnamize boat where Willard ends up killing a wounded Vientnam woman after everybody on the boat with her has been shot by his group. The bridge scene and the utter chaos when we learn that there is no leader for those guys protecting the bridge. The tiger, the scenery. I can go on and on. That's because Apocalypse Now is one of those rare war movies that just sweeps you into the plot with its epic storyline and doesn't let go.<br/><br/>The story involves Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who is given the duty of going into the jungles of Cambodia to kill one Lieutenant Kurtz (Marlon Brando) because the U.S. military believe that he has gone totally insane and is not looking out for his country's best interests anymore. Willard takes the job, and along the way runs into all kinds of trouble and horror. His mission, on a boat, leads him deeper and deeper into darkness until eventually he finds Kurtz.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola based his story of the Vietnam war on the novel Heart of Darkness which was written by Joseph Conrad. His own story follows that novel rather closely, and just as the novel becomes darker as the story goes on, so does Apocalypse Now. It all leads up to a very chilling and gripping ending which will never be forgotten even years from now. Apocalypse Now affected the conscious of everybody who watched it.<br/><br/>The movie is magnificent. Francis Ford Coppola, who also directed the Godfather Trilogy, has created another masterpiece here. The acting was superb by everyone. Some of the other familiar faces besides Brando and Sheen would include Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Frederic Forrest, Harrison Ford in a minor role, Dennis Hopper, and Scott Glenn. Great scenes, superb pacing, and epic storytelling make Apocalypse Now one of the greatest movies ever made."

","Apocalype Now is a good movie, but not the greatest movie ever made. It definitely portrays the horror and devastation of war. Scenes of the rampant, mindless destruction of what little possessions the Viet Namese had are especially horrible. It is easy to see how a person could lose their mind under the pressure of war. The question is: ""Did Kurtz lose his mind or was he the sane one of the bunch?"" He was called insane simply because he didn't follow orders. His mission to destroy was the same as his superiors, but he didn't follow the instructions they gave him.<br/><br/>""We cut 'em in half with a machine gun, and then give 'em a band aid.""

Marlon Brando is excellent as usual with his portrayal of the insane Colonel Kurtz, and Martin Sheen takes the audience in with him into the jungles as troubled Captain Willard. The main plot that we see at first is a mission to bring Kurtz back to the Army, but as Apocalypse Now goes on, it melts into a study of the human soul and mind, and what can happen to right and wrong in the insanity of war.

","I just feel you could really get into this movie quickly and that's what Coppola does so well and I've seen the same in Godfather and The Outsiders, just to name a few. And that's the connection right there and maybe since Coppola was the first to beat around the bush of Vietnam, this movie was harshly criticized. I do believe he could have waited and maybe he should've waited, I don't know. However, I don't think it could've gotten much if at all better if he had waited but maybe it wouldn't have gotten harshly criticized. Although, someone could've beaten him to the chase and that's when you've lost it. I do believe the reason why Apocalypse Now was so well received was because it was the first movie to give real life accounts of Vietnam. Controversy creates criticism but it also gets you out and establishes you, whether you're perceived to be bad or good. What I liked most about Apocalypse Now was the visual effects in the movie. They were just dazzling and I think they gave the movie a gritty, disturbing (in a sense)look and appeal. I especially liked the latter half of the movies scenery/effects. I think it was probably generally disliked the first couple of years it was out. I think you just need to get used to it. Maybe 1979 was too soon or maybe it was just right.

At the end of the river is the man who came before us, and we see the uselessness of the journey. It is the Heart of Darkness. There are death masters like Robert Duvall. There are those who can only hope to survive, but the war is the master. The Doors music as the napalm settles gently on the treetops and across the ground, sweeps us up gently. Meanwhile it is consuming the flesh of the Vietnamese people, as well as an occasional American soldier. The ancient Romans could not envision peace without war. We and much of the world seem to have embraced those tenets put forth some two thousand years ago. This film gets into the marrow."

","Cpt Willard (Sheen), an Army assassin with serious issues, is sent up the Mekong into Laos to ""terminate with extreme prejudice"" US Colonel Kurtz (Brando), who has either gone native or turned genocidal. He travels by boat through devastated Vietnam, searching through Kurtz...<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now appears to be, on the surface at least, merely Joseph Conrad's Hearts of Darkness in the Vietnam War era, but it is so much more. It is pure chaos on film, a visceral depiction of a war that has run out of anyone's control, through which the stunned Willarde errs, encountering fascinating characters similarly disconnected from reality: the warmongering fanatic Kilgore (Duvall), who leads air raids to the sound of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries and has a napalm fetish, a crazed US reporter (Hopper, just being himself really), an entrenched family of French colonists, and many more. And at the heart of the film, at the end of the stinking river of murder and mayhem, lies Kurtz (a god-like Brando).<br/><br/>The making of this colossal film was long, chaotic, painful and sufficiently well chronicled in the excellent documentary ""Hearts of Darkness"" not to be retold in this review. Suffice to say that it is a miracle that the film survived, and even benefited from its troubled conception. The unconventional editing and Vittorio Storraro's glorious saturated photography make this feel halfway between a nightmare and an acid trip. In short, it is a journey into hell, that begins with a storm of fire and ends in the devil's den.<br/><br/>The most telling moment of this film is of a siege against an unseen enemy, where Willlard encounters a raving soldier and asks him who is in charge, to which the soldier shrugs: ""Ain't it you?"". Apocalypse Now is every civilization's nightmare: that a war justified in a distant past would degenerate so foully, that men are reduced to less than animals.<br/><br/>One of the best and most unsettling films of all time."

","Watching Apocalypse Now has been a bit like watching a nightmare you once had but can't quite figure out. While on a surreal river journey that connects one classic, memorable scene to another, using some of the more daring cinematography I have seen in a war movie (in terms of originality), this movie can expose feelings of loneliness, terror and, maybe worst of all, the fear of learning how meaningless everything might be. Of course, if there is any resolution, its in the journey and each time I re-visit hoping that maybe this time I'll figure out something more. Brando may not have been trying his hardest in this movie, but he was given an almost impossible task at the end. In roughly 2 and a half scenes he had to hold up almost 2 hours of unbelievable hype and suspense. Almost any other performance could have sunk this movie or (maybe worse) rendered it conventional. Here he was what the movie was: dark, intriguing and inaccessible.(Re: Apocalypse Now, 1979)"

When they arrive at the US camp and it has no superior officer. Just guys smoking dope, shooting everywhere. 'The west is the best' ? But this film goes further than anything you could imagine, every scene, every part furthers characters and to an extent the human mind, this is very true of Martin Sheen, Brando and Hopper. The latter are already past coming back and soon enough Sheen joins them, but it was inevitable. War itself changes men, and the further he got to Kurtz the farther away from sanity he got.

","The way I am to understand it,Francis Ford Coppola got the go-ahead to film this re-adaptation(or re-envisioning)of Joseph Conrad's novella in 1974 and started filming it in 1975 or 1976.<br/><br/>Almost four years,plenty of re-shooting,a near feud with Universal over the production and one heart attack(Martin Sheen's)later and the film finally got released in 1980. Good reviews couldn't save it from being a very modest producer at the Box Office,but cable,VHS,DVD rentals have garnered it a cult following(not to mention a re-released,uncut edition)and I COMPLETELY understand why.<br/><br/>The story of Colonel Ben Willard(Sheen,looking every bit haggard and sickly),a mentally on-the-edge officer who is dispatched to eliminate""with extreme prejudice"" a rogue officer named Kurtz(Marlon Brando,bloated,dazed and foreboding.More of a reflection of the persona he'd be remembered for now than he was pre-Godfather)is one that seems to be more focused on the violent nightmare that was Vietnam than the actual mission itself. Along the river(the Mekong?),Willard and his small crew(which included Frederic Forrest and an under-aged Laurence Fishburne!)encounter various traps and locals,all driving them slowly to wits end themselves. By the time Willard reaches his intended destination,most of his squad is decimated and what awaits is a primitive society of ""natives"" who all nearly worship Kurtz,including a ranting photojournalist(a very memorable,and probably very tweeky,Dennis Hopper).<br/><br/>This film is strictly visceral(as Coppola rightly intended),but it works brilliantly at it. I haven't seen much of the Redux version,but what I have seen tells me it seems to add to the emotional range of this film. With a small cameo from a then-unknown Harrison Ford(as a dispatch Intelligence officer)and a somewhat larger cameo by Robert Duvall(as a nearly mythical gunnery Sargent),this film's images,sound and economy of lines allows the viewer to get the same unpurgeable,acrid and vivid experience of the madness that can be found IN war(as opposed to the madness of it). A must see for any film fan!"
"ziga321","9","0","1","23 November 2006"," Good film, but REDUX v. SCREWED it all
","One thing about i liked about the original version is that it is totally version is totally >>political incorrect<< and meaningless. It doesn't gets represented in good guys and bad guys, but get a human as a whole structure, and it gets this really well. Like in example you didn't see Kilgore as a bad person. In fact you didn't see him at all. All you see is his dreams and thoughts, which actually led to his destruction.<br/><br/>But what about political incorrectness with the new REDUX version: It licks the French butts, giving the Frech plantage scene on of the crappiest and meaningless IDIOTIC scene ever shot. I give the idiotic term, because it actually destroys the whole point of the movie, which is not about race and condition, but human as a whole!<br/><br/>One thing about Redux. The original was >visual astonishing< masterpiece, but what redux adds is A WHOLE LOT OF VISUAL EFFECTS. If this would set to minimum, i would love it, but after watching it, i get a filling of too much candy taste!, and you get that the whole point of this scene...and that...and this is avout This. About candy.<br/><br/>Giving this two reasons, i still have the ORIGINAL version in one of my favourite movies of all time and it would be hard to describe this film as a whole of my experience, because i still try to give it out of my head. What I actually liked about original is that it explores the 'dark side' of human, and it did with such a way, that you will remember this film MONTHS or maybe even years after you have been watching it. I watched it more than 20 times already. It's a true classic!<br/><br/>Like someone already said, the redux version didn't add nothing to this film, while i would say that it makes this film horrible!! I would too preferred to have two different versions in IMDb, giving viewers a choice, which is actually good and which is a crap. I actually scored the original. With REDUX i would give it minimum.<br/><br/>Sorry for my bad English and expression, i am not a native speaker. I still tried my best, to describe my feelings and emotions."
"Air America","8","0","1","2 November 2006"," The Best Thing About Redux
","The best thing about Redux is the color restoration and clarity. In the old version, you could hardly read the red letters below the crossed swords of the Cavalry, but now it stands out in perfect clarity, ""Death from Above."" <br/><br/>Many comments can and have been made about the content of this version, but overall I feel it was Coppola's intent to make a classic in the vein of ""Gone with the Wind,"" which I believe he succeeded at. While perhaps rightfully subject to some criticism about the storyline and editing which others have pointed out, I feel that overall, this version will insure Coppola's place as a producer of another classic. I have watched this film since it first came out on videotape, the first copy from about 1982 at a cost of $92. Even with the inherent poor quality of tape and the what must have been poor transfer of the original version, I have enjoyed watching this film many times.<br/><br/>I too have watched ""Heart of Darkness"" and ""The Search for Colonel Kurtz,"" a film made by a television channel, and I find the story compelling. Change the topography and the jungle to sand and the story is just as valid today or indeed in any time. I feel sure that in time, some writer will find a way to remake this film as the story is timeless. Yes, I am and always have been a great fan of this film. It may have its foibles but I can enjoy the bad with the good nonetheless."
"a_jordan_77","10","0","1","21 October 2006"," sympathy for the remake
","Like many people, I have mixed emotions about AN Redux. I was a devotee of the original, and I had difficulty imaging how it could be improved upon. Watching ""Redux,"" I felt like the quality of the dialogue in the added scenes lagged behind that of the rest of the movie. Plus, rather than being inexorably pulled toward Kurtz's lair, you felt pulled off course by some of the scenes. All that being said, the added scenes do give extra insight into Willard's character. For that, I think they are worthwhile.<br/><br/>In the original, you see the Captain as a shell of a man, haunted by the ghosts of things he has seen and done. As he travels down the river to meet Kurtz, you know that he recognizes the similarities between himself and his intended target, but you don't as completely realize what the differences are between the two men. This is important, because the differences are what give you hope that Willard may be able to escape the insanity that has overcome Kurtz.<br/><br/>In ""Redux,"" Willard displays that, though emotionally damaged, he is still capable of compassion toward other human beings (namely the PBR Streetgang crew). In the infamous Playboy bunny scene, where Willard trades 2 barrels of precious diesel fuel for 2 hours with the Playboy bunnies for his crewmates, his actions are not expedient, but they are kind. ""Charlie doesn't get much R&R,"" Willard says earlier in the film. Yet, when he has a chance to grant his men what is basically a dying-man's wish, he does it unhesitatingly. One knows that Kurtz would not have not have done the same thing, having abandoned compassion long ago.<br/><br/>Similarly, the French plantation scene depicts Willard as someone who, although racked by guilt, is not so far gone that he would refuse grace, in the form of a lovely, sympathetic French woman. Although I think the dialogue in this scene is awkward and clunky, I get the point. Sex becomes a metaphor for forgiveness, grace, etc. The person who is capable of accepting grace may be able to escape with their sanity. Again, Kurtz is beyond this, but Willard might not be.<br/><br/>The added scene with Willard's encounter with Kurtz in the shipping container prison, surrounded by Montagnard children is also, I think, helpful in clarifying the ending of the movie. After his final, symbolic act of killing Kurtz, Willard has the chance to call in the Arclight strike, and destroy completely all traces of the compound. You sense that this is what Kurtz would have done, innocents, children, and all. Willard's turning-off of the radio back on the patrol boat is a clear rejection of Kurtz's philosophy of horror. With the addition of the scene with the children, you have a better sense of exactly what he is rejecting.<br/><br/>In the end, I thought for all the remake's flaws, Willard's character came out of ""Redux"" as more well-rounded character, with a sense of compassion and honor. Even the act of killing Kurtz comes across more clearly as an act of mercy (among its other meanings). After watching ""Redux,"" the original film seems richer, and the ending a little less dark. For the doubters out there, my suggestion is to give ""Redux"" a chance (flaws and all), because it gives you an opportunity to watch the original with new eyes. Just remember the good parts, forget the bad."

","Excellent cast billing,without a doubt the best film i've seen with Martin Sheen.

It gives you a different outlet about the Vietnam war, this film wasn't just about action scenes as is so often the case with war films that i have experienced. A Bridge Too Far and The Deer Hunter are two other war films of this generation.Its easily better than A Bridge Too far and is as good if not better than The Deer Hunter. It gives you a better portrayal of the Vietnam war than Deer Hunter, i think I've just got a soft spot for Robert De Niro. To summarise the film, its one mans(Martin Sheen) journey across the river and through the battle grounds of Vietnam and Cambodia and he has to conquer his fears and obstacles that try to prevent him from completing his mission.

The spirit of this film is incredible though because it hardly mentions Vietnam, encounters with Vietcongs and battle but broader issues of human loss. It captures the surreal, psychedelic spirit of Vietnam. These are those cut off soldiers spending three sweaty years shooting at trees.

"grey-fox-kw","10","0","1","10 October 2006"," Satisfaction yet again
","The very first time when I've watched Apocalypse Now was about a year... say two years ago, the version with additional scenes. I must say that back then it didn't really make a powerful impression on me. I thought ""Hey, so this is Apocalypse Now, cool, let's move on to other stuff and leave the war for a while"". <br/><br/>Recently however, I have found the movie in the original version, and I watched it again in the soothing solitude of my household. After the credits started rolling, I was close to being awestruck. Not only has it been the most accurate movie about the Nam war I have seen in my entire life. More to that, the war story isn't the main thing going on in the movie still making it the best on its field and that is what I call a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Like one of the users said, the entire war event is a background to a personal and yet a universally metaphorical quest, a mission to carry on, a clash of idealistic views and political reality. To me, the greatest achievement of the movie is telling the Vietnam war story beside the point, in a very unique way (as it is a tale worth telling), loosing the historical style radiating either with pathos or overgrown dread.<br/><br/>The main plot, surprisingly, Willard's journey and his way of viewing his surroundings (evolving during the film), his attempts of understanding Kurtz and finally the act of confronting him, is far more powerful than the already strong background construction.<br/><br/>Another really interesting thing is that Francis Ford Coppola mixed the typical war climate with an element of, well... coolness. The choppers, the napalm, the troops... what they do does now transcend beyond a mundane war assignment and turns it into a kind of ritual, in a way that viewers are bound to remember for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>Next, the actors. I'm very proud of Coppola and basically the 70's, 80's and the early 90's for their crew combinations of great, really great movies. Although they may not be packed with the mega stars of the current decade (if you know what I mean), the important thing is those movies' actors have merged with their parts, making them indivisible from their roles. This does not always result in a skyrocketing career, but I greatly respect lesser known actors who had played a medium role and they played it good than a superstar who had plummeted from the peak of Olympus to the pits of Hades and still remains a superstar.<br/><br/>Sheen creates a kind of demented, wild and in the same time craving for peace, character. I believe it was a quite difficult job to do and I respect that. Duvall as the big old' USA cowboy with a liking of Wagner and the smell of napalm is an interesting and pleasant interlude. Same goes for the cracked up Dennis Hopper. The character of Kurtz however is a real cherry on the cream mountain. Those few scenes which include him or remains of his speeches, photos, history are conjured with evident mastery of storytelling. The last scenes when Brando is shown emerging, bathing in the shadowy sea, bearing the weight of existence and the burden of his actions... beautiful. <br/><br/>Luckily, the soundtrack does also not disappoint the craving viewer. A sophisticated set of great songs which act very well on their own as well as a greater part in Coppola's production.<br/><br/>I'm sure I'll watch Apocalypse Now a few more times in the future to ultimately memorize some speeches, gestures worthy memorizing. A very special movie, indeed one that every human being should see."

""crystalline"" clarity, on the specific Viet NÃ¢m conflict (which should have come in first, paradoxically...); and on the almost perfect performances of the actors, each one in itself (Robert Duvall alias Col. Kilgore is of course my favorite). I feel that much more than I could write in my whole lifetime has already been so.<br/><br/>I will try to ""explain"" the mystery that made me a zillionth fan of the movie after watching a version that a lot of the other fans consider a sacrilege insult to the original one. Since I have still not seen this latter, I will use another comment (thank you JohnIL), which by chance happens to list the differences between the two cuts.<br/><br/><ul><li>the additional footage in Col. Kilgore sequence is not superfluous. Nothing could be excessive in the description of this maniacal, sickly vindicative and epicly insane fan of surf, which also happens to be at the command of a whole airborne division, with its apocalyptic firepower. Concerning the stealing of his board, it is not contrary to the character of Capt. Willard. His almost gloomily taciturn behaviour during the journey up river is of circumstance (his reading of the dossier+the not so happy personal situation which precedes his being sent on the mission).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The sex-for-fuel scene is not the best of the movie of course, but it gives an additional note of craziness to the film; and is not craziness what this is ultimately all about ? Even if it was not worth, I would have added it only for the sake of Lawrence Fishburne last replica, which made me hilarious.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The supply boat scene is in my opinion irreplaceable... I can only say that I was truly amazed to read that it was not in the original cut. Capt. Willard intervention at the end of it is perfectly in context. It is not hurry that explains his act, so much as what he says just afterwards: ""Cutting people in half with a machine gun, and then giving them a bandage"" borders to cynical hypocrisy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The French plantation sequence is long. It almost breaks the pace of the movie (probably the primary reason for its suppression from the original cut). But first in the dinner scene, although the performances of the French actors are heterogeneous, there are very good things: the actor playing Hubert Des Marais is truly convincing, and the overall scene illustrates the fact that these people are eventually the only ones who fight for a sane reason among all the protagonists encountered during the voyage upriver. Secondly I love the opium smoking scene. Its delicious sensuality is precisely what could solely justify the excessive length and pace-breaking character of this addition.</li></ul><br/><br/>*** WHAT FOLLOWS MAY PARTLY BE CONSIDERED AS A SPOILER ***<br/><br/><ul><li>Finally the Time-magazine sequence is in my opinion magnifying two fundamental aspects of the character of Col. Kurtz: first his total, ferocious and unmitigated detestation for lies, which cover the pages of this newspaper as melted sugar on a love-apple; and secondly the fact that, despite his superhuman strength of character, Col. Kurtz is ill, and slowly dying. Although it is not emphasized in the dialogue nor the direction, Marlon Brando always inspired acting gives here the in a way disappointing vision of a man who was up to now anticipated as a Rambo coupled with a Lincoln. But reality (which is so absent of the rest of the world depicted here) caught with him: his body is eroded by a tropical illness, and his mind is every day more ripped apart by the weight of the contradictions with which ""the circumstances of this conflict"" are filled.</li></ul>"

","This movie blew me away when i first saw it in 1979. I've seen it many times since then but the last time had been a 10 year gap until i bought the ""complete dossier"" DVD for 15 bucks. I had forgotten just what a truly stunning movie it is - visually, dramatically, and in many other ways - it truly is an artistic triumph in my view. Somehow Coppola's vision ultimately morphed itself into a movie that was both a pro- and anti-war statement at the same time...but i believe the basic moral might be something on the lines of absolute power corrupting absolutely, etc. <br/><br/>It only comes undone just a little near the end; when Captain Willard finally reaches Kurtz's jungle compound. From this point on the movie becomes slightly comic bookish, if anything, and seems obviously written by someone who's never been in the military let alone been at war. I realize this isn't supposed to be a documentary or something but at some points it becomes senseless. (And it didn't help the film much when Brando himself became difficult to work with, and even insisted on improvising all his lines!)<br/><br/>However all is redeemed and made whole at the point when Willard finally kills Kurtz with a sickle, (while intercut is footage of natives slaughtering a buffalo with a sword, symbology of the most blatant kind), appears at the top of Temple Ruins holding Kurtz's notes for which Kurtz has asked him to be the bearer...and all Kurtz's Montagnard troops kneel before him as if acknowledging him as their new leader...this part is truly chilling and one of the profound moments in film history... Anyway I bought the DVD because i knew i will continue to watch this excellent and profound movie from time to time, for the rest of my life. Film as art, yes indeed, Coppola succeeded admirably with this one. It's safe to say, there will never be another movie quite like Apocalypse Now."

","I have seen several versions of this film. Years ago, when it first came out, in the theater, several times. A year or so ago I went to the theater to watch the newly edited and much longer version that had all that extra material added on. I just recently purchased a very inexpensive VHS version of the original; this version had the ending without the bombardment.<br/><br/>So, I've seen most of the iterations of this film. I want to first comment on the extra long version that came out recently. For me the extra hour or so of added material just added weight that was totally unnecessary to the plot. It made the film too long and the plot diversions with the French added nothing but padding. Willard's character didn't need to visit with them and so I was left wondering why it was included. I understand that legend has it that Coppola shot about 200 hours of film. Heck, with all that extra stuff lying around, I guess the temptation to put it back was too great. The extra material with the Playboy bunnies was useless.<br/><br/>Watching the original again reminded me of how much I did not like the soundtrack. OF course I liked the Wagner and The Doors. The rest was just awful to my ears. I found that the only redeeming factor that the longest version has over the others is the outstanding colors that come out in the fresh print. The additional material with Robert Duval was silly and not necessary. As well the additional Brando scenes did not add to the ""darkness"" but detracted by making his appearance seem too normal.<br/><br/>The actors: for me what is sad is that the film is really Martin Sheen's best opus of his entire career. While nearly dying in the process of making it, he gave as much gut wrenching inner being in this film as Brando gave in Last Tango. What I cannot grasp is that most critics talk about the colors or the amount of money or the travails of shooting the film and very little on Sheen's contribution. It is, after all, his journey into the darkness and it is mostly through his eyes that we frame our thoughts. Sheen's characterization of the descent into chaos and hell is as good a performance as a human being could have given. He reflects the full ""horror"" of hell without the slightest hint of over-acting or romanticism. Brando, it is reported, had not read ""Heart of Darkness"", which is a bit hard to believe, in that he was very well read. He had not read the script but upon doing so hated it and continually argued with Coppola. That's Brando for you. It is said that it was Brando's idea to be shot in shadows for the majority of his time and in this I think he was dead on. It is a big shame that instead of having Brando's 45 minute improvisation that was edited out of the final edition, Coppola instead put in the extra rubbish as I've reported above. I bet you that the Brando material, if it ever sees the light of day, will prove to be far and away more interesting and captivating than the extra stuff that was added on. Brando as an improvisational actor had no peer and only a few could come close to his levels. Imagine watching 45 minutes of a man descend into his own hell.<br/><br/>In closing, the original film even though not as visually stunning as the re-edited cut of last year was a far better product in it's slimmer format. The story, while still a bit loose holds together whereas the longer version gets sidetracked into paths we don't need to tread. The entire supporting cast is superb and of course Duval just chews up the scenery in all his moments. While still a really great film, the soundtrack bothered me quite a bit and so it's not a 10. It is a film that looks better if you've read Conrad and are familiar with those themes. Coppola almost succeeds to create the film this could have been; the result is still very much worth absorbing if only for the searing paths of hell Sheen walks."

","Perhaps I missed this in other comments, but I have not seen anyone recognize the fact that this movie is a film version a novel. Titled Heart of Darkness, it is set in Dutch-controlled Colonial Africa. The book was written in the late 1800's, I think. Most of the characters are the same, just tweaked a little bit. Thought you all would enjoy this bit of trivia.<br/><br/>Kurz is in the book, too. He even says ""The horror...the horror."" Coppolla's work is awesome, considering that he has fantastically translated that book into a Vietnam-war movie. The fact that he was able to use the same characters, and some of the same words is amazing, and that he completely switched the time and place from traveling up the Congo in the 1800's to Vietnam is a phenomenal piece of work. <br/><br/>Apocalyse Now proves that a director who follows his own instinct will make a masterpiece, rather than a director who will kneel down to voices from the big studio. Sure, many scenes seem too ""fantastic"" or ""unreal"", but isn't that the point--to get us thinking about western domination over the 3rd world? Just a thought."
"ginger_the_Wolf","10","0","1","3 September 2006"," One of the most harrowing film experiences...
","It's rare that you watch a film, and from the opening shot you are dragged in, and can't let go until the last frame. Even, as the credits began to roll at the end, I was transfixed, I sat through them all as if still under the spell of perhaps one of the best films I've ever seen. I'm not usually one who is so quickly to judge, but there are certain movies that get you that first time, and this is it.<br/><br/>Set during the Vietnam war, this is the story of a Captain Willard(Martin Sheen) who has been given a mission to assassinate an American commander, who they believe has lost his mind. There is little story to this film, it reminds me greatly of Aguirre: The Wrath of God. They follow the river, looking for a Holy city. When Willard finally finds Kurtz, he has come across a seemingly ancient city, where Kurtz has been deified and is worshiped. Also like Aguirre, we see human self destruction... but unlike Aguirre this time it's not necessarily stemmed by greed, but in uncertainty and anarchy.<br/><br/>Visually, one of the most stunning films I've ever seen. It's beautiful and grotesque all at once. Smoke is almost always looming, hiding behind the trees, seeping down to the water, hiding what should be clear as day. It's like looking at the biblical art of the middle ages, and early Renaissance. Eerily beautiful, almost surreal...unsettling devout, truthful and lying all at once. The use of music is also one of the best examples I've ever come across. I always feel as though many soundtracks feel so forced, but this one... it just works. The opening scene with ""The End"", is incredible. It's almost as if The Doors had this film in mind when they composed it. It's not just this scene though, it always works... this film seems to almost have created itself.<br/><br/>Finally, as a war film... it's still hard to decipher what it has to say. It's easy enough to say ""this is an anti-war film"", but it's really so much more. This film does so much more than point out the faults of the Vietnam war, and war on a universal level. It strips away at humanity itself, our own impulses and moral natures. One of the best films I've ever seen, honestly, good thing I started this project or who knows how long it would have taken me to get around to seeing this masterpiece."

","Apocalypse Now tells the story of a soldier who is sent out to find and terminate Col. Kurtz, a highly decorated war hero who has been driven insane by the horrors of Vietnam. We follow Captain Willard and his crew through their journey up the river to find Col. Kurtz, including battles among the enemy as well as amongst themselves, and we see the toll war can take on the human mind. This is a chilling portrayal of the Vietnam war, and it's not your usual war movie.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola was hot off the success of The Godfather, The Godfather Part II and The Conversation when he tackled this movie, based off a book called Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Coppola went through utter hell making this movie, but it was all worth it, because he churned out a good project. This movie isn't your conventional tale of war. It is more a tale of the inner turmoil that can be caused by war. The action scenes are few, but the dramatic scenes are so well done that you find yourself not craving the action. I truly enjoyed the style the film was made in. The movie starts off with a realistic atmosphere, but as Captain Willard's journey progresses, things begin to look more and more unhinged, more and more surreal, until he reaches the utter insanity of Col. Kurtz's base camp.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are great. The movie is filled with great actors including Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper, and Robert Duvall, and they all give knockout performances.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very chilling and very stylish war film, and I'd recommend that anyone who watches it not sit down expecting a film like Platoon.<br/><br/>8/10"
"newsjunkie356-1","8","0","1","19 August 2006"," DEMAND Redux Version
","Like its basis, Jospeh Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", ""Apocalypse Now"" isn't so much a story as an experience. In a way similar to Kubrick's masterpiece, ""2001"", this movie is a sensory experience that is, at once, a metaphor for the American (and French) experiences in Vietnam, and an examination of men in the most extreme human experience: war. As Nietzsche wrote: when you look into the abyss, the abyss looks into you. And America, like Coppola's hero, is never the same again.<br/><br/>The ""Redux"" version's added footage fleshes out both the metaphor and the film in a way that makes for a much more satisfying cinematic experience. The protagonists' stay with the French family heightens both the insanity and intensity of the movie's denouement and very much belongs in the film. <br/><br/>Ultimately, however, like the Vietnam-era itself, the movie lacks coherence. As in the ""Godfather, Part II,"" Coppola disregards traditional cinematic structure. Thirty-three years after American military involvement in Vietnam came to end, the country is still as divided as ever. Thus it is little wonder that reactions to this movie will vary as much as the individual's opinions, and experiences, of that tragic, and seemingly interminable, era in American history.<br/><br/>The film is also unique for the roster of actors who would later become superstars. It also noteworthy for being Marlon Brando's swan song; after ""Apocalypse"" his sad decline into overpaid cameos, depression, obesity and family tragedy would begin. <br/><br/>Coppola's three masterpieces, ""The Godfather,"" ""The Godfather, Part II,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" all examine the nature of evil, especially that of an essentially good man losing himself in evil. Without the razorsharp plotting, brilliant character development of the Godfather films, ""Apocalypse Now"" is a chaotic miasma lacking nearly all of the qualities that made the Coreleone epic the greatest family story in film history. Despite its defects, which are manifold, ""Apocalypse"" is utterly unforgettable."

My favourite scenes are towards the end with in a darkly lit temple featuring Sheen and Marlon Brando, who is stunnning in his small performance.

","Just finished reading a very lucid and well prepared argument against the redux version of the film released in 2001. I must admit, at the moment i am neither particularly lucid nor well prepared, but i found the redux version superior to the original release for several reasons, a few of which i suspect to be sound. Clarity. I am as much a fan of drug induced incoherence as anyone (a quick stroll through my other IMDbposted remarks should prove that); but the expanse of the redone film film with its little morality play Playboy bunny arc and Renoir homage French Plantation sequence adds so much moral weight to the vision that it is barely the same film. The 1979 version is like an acid trip, jumping from one great scene to the next where the mind spend much of its time trying to catch up. In the Redux version all scenes seem connected, everything makes sense, even if the sense is somewhat uglier than the original. To me the French plantation sequence is of paramount importance to establishing the gravity of the film as a grand indictment and not just a heady horror story with intellectual presumptions.<br/><br/>Sure, rent either, preferably both, but i believe if you do rent both you'll agree the extra clarity and gravity of the longer version was worth the 22 year wait."

","Apocalypse Now still leaves me with the feeling I've just had a dream that I can't remember. That feeling that something special happened, but I have no idea what. Here are a couple case in points. The air assualt on the VC village, the Playboy Bunny dancers, and the river boats cruising past the downed B-52. I remember the plot, but something about the pacing seemed like it was part indulgence, part burden. Writing this doesn't clear up what I'm thinking. My problem may be that Conrad's, ""Heart of Darkness"" is a moody work, and the moods in this film seem to have blunted what Vietnam was reported and recorded as for mass consumption. An artificial construct like Apocalypse Now requires more nimble story telling. The character study of Kilgore was great, the surfing inane and perfect. The image of the helicopter carrying the cow in a net doesn't get any weirder, but it was like looking a paint pallet. The story needed to be blended better. It's tough to say how, and maybe Apocalypse Now is a true product of it's time. As developed a film about could be 1979, but still too imersed in the culture of the time to get past itself and on with the story."

","Even for those who find Conrad a bit much, this film brings the quagmire that we call the ""Vietnam War"" into clear focus. Like Lawrence of Arabia, the film forces us to ask the question of what would induce a high-ranking officer of the dominant Western country to ""go native."" In forcing us to reconsider the justification of military intervention into other peoples' cultures--and especially in light of recent U.S. efforts to democratize Iraq--this film provides provocative social commentary. Although disturbing, the film is a reminder of what happens when we blindly follow the ideology of a dominant elite that falls prey to its own rhetoric. Astute observers will see that Conrad's discussion of early British coloniailsm in Africa, this film's focus on U.S. intervention in Vietnam strikes a familiar chord to the present occupation activities in Iraq."

Still, this is a wonderful movie, with amazing acting and a compelling story, just don't expect it to be the same throughout.<br/><br/>If you've read Heart of Darkness, or are supposed to read it, don't expect this movie to follow it any further than general plot.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now Redux gets an A for being an amazing movie, with many parts that stick in the viewer's mind."

What the hell was that?!?!? I've just spent the vast majority of a night watching the Redux version of this film & I'm a bit confused. I mean, technically I can appreciate why people rave about this film & there is certainly something special about it. However, I just don't get what the fuss in general is about. The plot is good up until a point & then he meets Brando. I mean, even with the Redux added French bit which people seem to condemn, the film was still entertaining. I just don't understand why the film switches from a movie about the horrors of war (of which it shows brilliantly, not least in Fishburne's death) to some sort of art house film featuring natives & dancing. I just don't understand what happened. Coppola is amazing as director & I don't think anyone's acting can be questioned (Duvall & Sheen being especially worthy of mention), but I just feel that if they'd done a decent ending, the film would have been so much more satisfying. I feel like I've watched a movie on video & the video broke halfway through the movie & switched to a different one alltogether. I guess it could be just me, but I do feel that with a bit more thought into the ending & this film could have been in the imdb top 10 movies rather than at 32 (last time I checked anyway).<br/><br/>Having said all that, despite a weak ending, for the first 3/4 of the film, I was entertained (and this coming from a Brit who isn't too keen on american Vietnam films).

","One of the most overrated films ever made.  ""Apocalypse Now"" is the confluence of brilliant directing and horrible screenwriting.  Wait, what script?  Coppola lifted the most memorable moments from a coffee table book on the Vietnam war (I think most fans of the film don't know this). <br/><br/>
War films are problematic from the get go because directors face overwhelming pressures to sensationalize the violence and preach to the audience.  Coppola does both.  What's worse is by film's end it's clear he doesn't have much to say (""the horror""? come on).<br/><br/>Fortunately so many films have now been made about Vietnam that its intent to be some ""definitive statement"" has receded and one can now appreciate the artistry.

Well, I don't know, but I'm going to give it a shot....<br/><br/>First and foremost, its view of the Viet Cong is more of a literary pretention than any kind of realistic assessment.  Charlie may have been ""moving too fast, or dug in too deep"" to have his own version of USO shows, but, according to historians, he also rioted in the tunnel systems on any Fridays that there was no film.  Furthermore, to judge from the work of Gen. Harry Sumner, and Gen Moore's book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young, the guerillas were not reverting to some cruel, primitive self, but simply trying to keep alive in the absence of regular supplies or the support of regular forces.<br/><br/>Likewise, in this film, Col. Kurtz is supposed to be the man who actually understands the war.  In many respects though, he's just a William Calley type who broke free and pursued his methods on his own.<br/><br/>To repeat my point, this film is not about Viet Nam; it's about what some film-makers living in California wanted that war to be.  It may be interesting as a ""trip flick""--the original script, The Psychedelic Soldier, was in fact just that--but as a statement of war, it fails."

Willard(Martin Sheen)accepts a classified mission to terminate Col. Walter Kurtz(Marlon Brando), who is a loose cannon that has strayed from the program. Kurtz is not of sound mind or deed and has crossed over into Cambodia where he reigns God-like over a renegade outpost. Coppola succeeds in presenting his highly ambitious depiction of the disturbing horrors of war. Not only are Brando and Sheen excellent; Robert Duvall is in top form in his short screen time. Other notable cast members are: Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper. Scott Glenn, G.D. Spradlin, Harrison Ford and R. Lee Ermey all have minor roles. Sam Bottoms and a young Laurence Fishburne are cardboard and pedestrian.

","This movie has many powerful scenes.  It deserves it's status as an American film classic.  However, I found the redux version way too long.  I felt some of the restored scenes in the movie took away from the flow.  Especially out of place was the scene where they arrive at the French plantation.  I think the picture does a good job of conveying the hopelessness and confusion that probably existed in the battlefield.  Duval's character was my favorite of the film.  His character's willingness to attack a difficult target was more inspired by his desire to surf on the beach than to accomplish a military goal.  I think that conveyed a sense of the way that some military decisions were made.  However, I didn't buy the Kurtz character.  I thought Brando's acting was great, but the situation of him forming his own little army to fight the war was too outlandish.

Marlowe in ""Heart"" can't bring himself to tell the truth, so he lies about Kurtz's last words, telling his ""intended"" they were her name, instead of what we know they were, thus nailing himself to the heart of darkness. The movie is a journey up river & to the center of the earth.<br/><br/>Maybe ""Now"" is even the retelling of the Odyssey: Willard in search of Kurtz is Telemachus in search of Odysseus. But Brando's Odysseus is as mad at the end here as Odysseus tried to be in the Iliad. Then the Oedipal twist: kill the father & marry the memory (""It's no mistake that I got to be the caretaker of Walter E. Kurtz's memory."").<br/><br/>Everybody here is mesmerizing: coldly professional assassin Capt. Willard is as dumbfounded as a 10 year old when confronted with the TV news team (""Make like you're fighting!""). The war may run by four-star clowns, but it's OK, because ""Charlie don't surf!""<br/><br/>Just like Conrad threw up walls of words to bury his story, Coppola erects walls of symbolism to hide ""the horror."" There are endless diversions from the inevitable: ""I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead.""<br/><br/>Maybe one day there'll be a Redux redux: the post-Cold War ""Now."" Could there be dozens of Kurtzes, forcibly sequestered in caves or deserted monasteries by the war profiteers? With Willard the real Telemachus? What happened when Kurtz died? Did the tribes disband?

Maybe Coppola is just trying to get too much across in the movie.

Of course, there are valid stylistic/artistic reasons for doing that but I'm not thoroughly convinced straight after seeing the movie.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is for the most parts visually well made, even stunning at time, and the story is interesting enough.

"andrew7","9","0","1","5 February 2002"," Amazing Achievement
","I have very little to add about this remarkable, powerful, incredibly demanding film.  But I would like to draw special attention to the performance of Marlon Brando as Col. Walter Kurtz.  I know, everyone talks about how great Brando is, but I want to really focus on what it is that makes him so great in this particular role.  <br/><br/>While the character of Kurtz is utterly central to this film, Brando does not appear (except as a disembodied voice on an audio recording) until the final act of the film.  In the meantime, as we follow Capt. Willard on his journey, the image of Kurtz in our minds becomes bigger and bigger.  Like Willard, the more we here about Kurtz, the more fascinated we become, and the film quite cleverly intersperses the various episodes of the journey with additional information on Kurtz, thus constantly building the tension toward the ever approaching finale.  <br/><br/>When Willard finds Kurtz's followers (including Dennis Hopper's memorable photojournalist), our image of Kurtz changes and grows again.  What sort of a man could inspire this sort of reaction in these people.  When Willard finally meets Kurtz, the dramatic tension has been ratcheted up so high, no one has any idea what will happen.  Will Willard kill Kurtz, or become another of his followers the way his predecessor did?<br/><br/>After having kept the audience waiting for so long, the introduction of Kurtz has got to at least fulfill, if not transcend, the expectations of the audience.  If not, the last act will be a terrible anti-climax, and the film as a whole will be a dramatic failure.  Has there ever been a film which put so much pressure on one performance?  If there has, I don't know it. <br/><br/>
But Brando nails it.  He takes our expectations and he trounces them.  The image of that massive hand on top of that bald head will stay with me forever.  The voice, almost ethereal.  To build an entire film as a massive, gradual build to a climax, and have that climax surpass even the promise of the build-up... it's an exhilarating movie experience. <br/><br/>
After the climax, Willard walks slowly back to his boat.  Kurtz's followers first make way, and then follow him.  Clearly, the idea is that, in their eyes, Willard has no attained the God-like status of Kurtz.  In their eyes. Not in ours.  We get the point, we understand the message, but we don't feel it in this way.  Why?  Because Martin Sheen just walks back to the boat.  He just walks back to the boat.  There is nothing about Sheen's performance here that makes the audience see him as a God-like figure, the way we saw Brando.  We get the God imagery from the way the others respond to his walking back to the boat.  Sheen isn't acting like a character who is seen as a God.  Sheen is walking back to the boat.  The others are acting like characters who see him as a God.  So, the perception of Willard as God-like has nothing to do with Sheen's performance.  <br/><br/>But what about the prior perception of Kurtz as God-like?  The most remarkable thing about it is that we barely see Kurtz interact with anyone except Willard.  While the long, gradual build-up certainly helps to build up the mythology around Kurtz, in the final analysis, Brando is solely responsible for bringing it on home.  [Well, to be fair, the lighting helps a great deal too.]  Because we don't see hundreds of extras treating Kurtz like a God, Brando has to act like a God in order for us to get it, and in order for the film to work.  <br/><br/>It's stunning."

","I've never thought this movie was really about Viet Nam, but rather used the Vietnam War as a context, a backdrop about much more complex, and philosophical issues.  It has very little, it seems, to say about the political or military experience, in that war.  However, it has enormous things to say about humanity, madness, death, nature, technology, and civilization.  I suppose any book or movie will mean different things to different people, and seeing something may not have been what the writer intended--but I don't think that detracts or means its false, sometimes writers or artists don't fully appreciate their own work (always makes me think about the scene in ""Back to School"" where Kurt Vonnegut ghost writes an analysis of his book Slaughterhouse Five for Rodney Dangerfield, only to have the professor declare it to be the worst paper she'd ever seen.<br/><br/>As for Apocalypse Now, the basic story or central purpose seems, to me, to show how thin the veneer of civilization really is--that our darker savage selves are only to ready to come struggling to the surface.  As Martin Sheen goes up the river, he loses sight of civilization, as if jungle were sucking it up, overcoming all of it. I've seen it also described as a journey back in time, which in some sense is the same idea--to that end, the last twenty minutes or so with Brando shaded in darkness is genius.<br/><br/>
As he sits there pondering the true nature of man--and how in warfare, horror becomes a friend--you can see the culmination of Willard's trip; the high tech helicopters and munitions have been stripped away (seeing the downed helicopter just before reaching Kurtz was an interesting example). When Chef says ""I don't care where my soul goes as long as it isn't here,"" he's looking straight into the black nature of humanity.  It's interesting to compare the conversation Willard has at the very beginning of the movie, with the General and the CIA, in the comfort of an urban setting, with a nice lunch, silverware, calmly talking about assassinating Kurt; with the last conversation between Sheen and Kurtz in the middle of the jungle, surrounded by barbarians and death, without the first of civilization's comforts.  The General talks blandly about ""good and evil"" and the need for control, to eliminate the insane Kurtz's command. Kurtz on the other hand talks about horror--and the will to butcher, it's almost like he sees a place beyond good and evil (must have been reading his Nietzsche). <br/><br/>
The Redux version adds a few things to the original that tend to detract from the tempo and the flow, and aren't needed.  I'm still glad Coppola put it out, I find it interesting to see different versions, but for anyone who's seeing it for the first time, definitely check out the original before going to Redux.  Both are great movies, but, as others have noted, one scene seems bizarre--when Willard steals the surfboard, it's just totally out of character as is his swapping fuel for some play time with the bunnies. <br/><br/>
This is not an upbeat movie, it seems to portray humanity as a creature of nature--and not in a good way: Nature comes off as teeming, brutal, endlessly damp and unforgiving, and ultimately--cruel.  Civilization is easily lost, and the ""better angels of our nature"" are mythic.  I'd expect others have different views and interpretations, which is another virtue of this movie--it's very rich and complex.  I'd suggest it to anyone who likes a thoughtful flick."

The journey that Willard had to trek was an arduous and dangerous one. And very mental too. As the journey to Kurtz got closer, the more we can see what kind of madness reside in him (Kurtz).

","Apocalypse Now is a truly stunning film. It is supposed to be a modernization and adaptation of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"". I can't comment on that aspect as I have never read that novel in it's entirety. I should also point out that the version I've just seen is the Redux version which is Francis Ford Coppola's true vision of the film as he originally intended.<br/><br/>Visually, this film is sumptuous. The cinematography is excellent and the use of camera angles and juxtaposition of images is well-done. The use of lighting is always appropriate for the progress of the film and adds to the atmosphere of the various locales.<br/><br/>I should also comment on the performances. Martin Sheen is terrific. The supporting performances are also terrific. My two complaints about the cast would be that Dennis Hopper plays a very typical role for him and his character seems unnecessary to me. He's good, but it's no stretch for him. Also, Marlon Brando, as the rogue Colonel Kurtz, seems miscast to me. I'm sure the filmmakers jumped at the chance to cast Brando and his performance is very good but I can think of other actors who would have fit a bit better perhaps. It's also disconcerting that he seems to be wearing make-up around his eyes. It looks like mascara. This may have been intended and it's really not important but I found myself repeatedly noticing it.<br/><br/>My main problem with this film is that the message of the film, that war is insane and that participating in war will make YOU insane, is not delivered subtly but with a sledgehammer. The character of Kilgore played by Robert Duvall is not really a character but a caricature. Even his name is an intentional coincidence. In a film like this, you like to find yourself delving into the film but I found myself crashing back to reality too often as several characters behaved not only insanely but unrealistically. No matter how insane a Cavalry Colonel may be, there are certain things he wouldn't do, at least not for long.<br/><br/>This film is also very long, and while I never found it dragging at all, there were scenes that were possibly unnecessary. The entire French plantation sequence could have been dropped although it may have been Coppola's intention to humanize Sheen one final time before the conclusion.<br/><br/>This film has to be appreciated. It was obviously a labor of love for Coppola and it shows. There are many scenes that are awesome in scope and vision. The film is also consistently beautifully shot. Thought provoking and certainly inspiring conversation, this film should be seen by everyone. I give it a solid eight out of ten, possibly even a nine.

"Nick-145","10","0","1","12 January 1999"," Masterpiece microcosm of the Vietnam War.
","What most commentators and critics overlook about this film is that it has encapsulized in one film the entire political scandal that we have come to know this war as.  It is a microcosm of the tragic scandal the U.S. was involved in S.E. Asia for almost a decade.  Martin Sheen (a military intelligence officer) is hired (by a general and an ominous looking civilian) to kill a ""hero"" officer single-handedly responsible for multiple victories in a region considered a ""no man's land"" by other general officers.  During Sheen's journey he encounters ""druggie"" enlisted men, ""cowboy"" helicopter warriors, a government sponsored ""girlie show"" where drugs are trafficked by a quartermaster. Sheen is escorted by a boat crew that includes a fellow with the initials ""L.B.J.(!)"" who is responsible for every bad incident that is encountered. This character, L.B. JOHNSON (get it?) even remarks ""This is like DisneyLand!"" and of course he remains unscathed to the end. Sheen, upon completion of his mission, has killed a prolific American officer, destroyed his military escorts, crushed his own allegiance to the U.S. and has his host's village ""bombed back into the stone-age""... A fairly good microcosm of the war.  Oh, and by the way, the character ""LBJ"" is the only person other than Sheen who survives the film.  Look for a brief cameo of a young Harrison Ford in the first 15 minutes of the film."
"claudonio","7","0","3","8 November 2000"," My candidate for the most overrated movie of all time
","""Apocalypse Now"" in my opinion is the most overrated movie of all time. It is not a bad movie but it is not a great one either. I kept waiting for this film to climax, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. I liked a few of the attack sequences and the cinematography but other than that, nothing. I just don't get what is so great about this film."
"Arnold-10","7","0","2","22 March 2000"," A good film that could have been better.
","This film is one of the more disappointing ""great"" films I've yet to see. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a _good_ movie.  The cinematography is excellent, I thought the Helicopter attack scene was magnificent, and the performances by Sheen, Duvall, and to an extent, Brando's as well, and I felt the pacing was great, if not just a bit slow, but was an excellent parallel to the nature of the war in Vietnam.  For the first 3/4ths of the film, I thought this was a great movie... <br/><br/>And then I reached the ending.  This ending was so drawn out and mind-numbingly slow that I couldn't wait for the film to wrap up.  I heard that the reason behind this was that originally Brando's part was relatively short, but he wanted to get more screen time, so he stretched it out as far as humanly possible.  It certainly seems to be the case.  And as such, it is a detriment to what otherwise is a fantastic film."
"seancolins","Null","0","4","19 March 2000"," How part of the world did end with Vietnam
","I have seen a few Vietnam War movies.  None of them were honorable or were depressing.  Oliver Stones Vietnam is only dark and wants you to die miserably.  Coppala depicts The Vietnam War incredibly well.  The cinematography is great and it is very anti-war.  Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando are great.  This show that the soldiers in Vietnam were not all monsters and knew more than the word ""F***"" and such.  It does however show that there were some evil soldiers with Martin Sheen.  (The boat incident). Coppala show how men went insane in the war with Marlon Brando.  The film is a masterpiece.  The oscar went to a lower class ""Kramer Vs. Kramer."" This should have won.  This is much better than the idiotic and disrespectful ""Platoon.""  This is one of the best war films out there.  If you want to see a great film about Vietnam and its horrors see this.  If you one to get realy depressed and start hating an honorable people see ""Platoon."" There are several great speeches in this film that you've probably heard being made fun of or what ever.  Coppala will take you away with this masterpiece Vietnam War film."
