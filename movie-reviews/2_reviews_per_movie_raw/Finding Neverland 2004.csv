","Johnny Depp takes us by the hand and in the gentlest most reassuring way leads into the heart, soul and mind of an artist. How easy is for the world to judge. How frightened we still are of all we don't understand. The very nature of innocence is suspect because innocence belongs exclusively to the innocent. Every time the world claims to protect it, tends to destroy it. ""Finding Nerverland"" is filled with moments of enlightenment. Moving and powerful moments but none more so than Julie Christie's face as she applauds, converted to the fantasy transported into her daughter's house. The moment and the enlightenment are short lived, but, somehow, remains in my mind as a glimmer of hope. If for a moment she accepts the mystery of it all, maybe we all could. Johnny Depp is the best American actor of his generation, period. Kate Winslet is a stunning rarity among her contemporaries. She doesn't look like anybody else and the camera catches every tiny little thought that crosses her marvelous face. Congratulations Mr. Forster you can count on me from this moment on as a devoted fan."

","I am not a film critic by any means, and don't aim to pose as one. That being said, I felt that this movie was by far one of the most touching and entertaining movies I have seen in my short 22 years. The cast is fabulous, every actor plays his/her part so to speak. <br/><br/>The story centers around J. M. Barrie, creator of Peter Pan, and his journey to writing the well-known play. It highlights his genius, while also showing the painful isolation that comes with being a mind ahead of your time. There are some liberties taken when put against the actual events that led up to the birth of Peter Pan, but don't let this dissuade you from watching--""Finding Neverland"" was never slated as being a documentary! <br/><br/>Being a huge Johnny Depp fan, one would think that my judgment would be tainted by his involvement in the film. However, even I can admit to a failed Depp movie (i.e. The Secret Window). At first, I thought that putting Depp outside of his usual character type, a mildly strange pirate/writer/doctor/investigator/man with scissors for hands, might signify a substandard film. Boy was I wrong! He nailed J.M. Barrie and was absolutely captivating throughout the entire film. I hate to sound like a starry-eyed fan but I thought his performance in this movie was downright Oscar-worthy! <br/><br/>Depp is magnificent, but he does not carry the weight of this film on his own. A slue of other fine actors and actresses, Kate Winslet and Freddy Highmore just to name a few, give absolutely divine performances. Do yourself a favor, shell out the eight bucks and go see this movie!"

","I don't know how good this movie is and I don't care because I loved it. It left me kind of numb. Moved, transported, enchanted. That's exactly how I want to feel when I get out of a movie. ""Finding Neverland"" gave it to me, in spades. Johnny Depp, hey Johnny you're the best we've got. I forgot that it was you two minutes into the movie, I only knew I loved that character. That in itself is part of the many miracles the movie has in store. Yours, is a performance of perfect beauty. Kate Winslet is quickly becoming my favourite actress. Julie Christie is, was and always will be my ""Darling"" but Freddie Highmore, you and your brothers gave me one the best evenings in a movie theatre I had in a long, long, time. My girlfriend just read my comment over my shoulder, her comment was very succinct: ""You write like a woman"" Okay, let's see if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Good night kids."
"merrywood","10","187","236","2 December 2004"," The Wings of Imagination
","The real J.M. Barrie was influenced and inspired as a child in Scotland by the adventurous stories of Robert Louis Stevenson of pirates, Indians and kidnapped boys. As a young journalist in London in the peak years of the Gilded Age his vivid imagination took him from novels to stage-plays. <br/><br/>Barrie loved games and founded a cricket club with fellow writers Arthur Conan Doyle and P.G. Wodehouse. An old nugget describing his personality tells of his comments upon himself and others that often appeared in the newspapers. He once remarked to H.G. Wells, ""It is all very well to be able to write books, but can you wiggle your ears?"" It was in the very early years of the 20th Century, now 101 years ago and the same year that in the windy Outer Banks of North Carolina that the Wright Brothers took flight that Jamie Barrie's Peter Pan soared into the air on wires in the London stage. <br/><br/>Marc Forester's fascinating film biography adapted by David Magee from Allan Knee's play, ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan,"" now comes to us in this delightful, moving account, 'Finding Neverland.' It presents historical reality between lushly imagined expeditions to a fictitious Neverland. It's performed impeccably by Johnny Depp as Sir James Mathew Barrie and an extraordinary cast under the able direction of Marc Forster.<br/><br/>This is the loveliest film of the year, highly recommended. Bring Kleenex for the final scenes and see how difficult it is to leave the theater and return to today."
"jasonflum","10","450","585","11 December 2004"," Wow
","I always tell my students that they can't claim a movie they just saw as their favorite movie ever because it has yet to stand the test of time. Every now and then a movie comes along that defies that rule for me -- a movie that as soon as I finish seeing it I know that it is an instant classic, if not ""my favorite movie ever."" American Beauty was such a movie.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland is such a movie. Every minute of this movie was simply incredible -- I felt like the kids in the theater on the opening night of Peter Pan. Johnny Depp is absolutely astounding, as he usually is, as JM Barrie. The rest of the adult cast doesn't quite come up to his level, but are uniformly strong. The kids, especially Peter and Michael, are wonderful. Maybe I just love the British accent, but one of my favorite scenes comes very early when Barrie meets Michael in the park -- Michael's accent reminded me so much of the kid in The Little Prince!<br/><br/>What raises this movie above standard fare, though, are the clever entries into Barrie's imagination. The magical moments in this movie seem to literally jump off the screen. Without a doubt, a film worthy of Oscar nominations for Depp, screenplay adaptation, cinematography (the pirate ship scene is gorgeous), and best movie of the year. Treat yourself - despite the PG rating, this is NOT a movie just for kids -- believe... 10/10"
"lochnessmummy","9","150","189","29 December 2004"," Now that we're past the hype... don't miss this movie!
","Every holiday season Harvey Weinstein and Miramax talk up one of their properties, fully expecting everyone to bow and throw awards at it as soon as it's released. This year it's Finding Neverland, which has produced a lot of buzz in favor of Johnny Depp's sophisticated performance. Although the film deserves all the praise it gets, it is understandable that moviegoers are a little weary with another dramatic period piece, with another ""oscar caliber"" cast, about yet another take on Peter Pan.<br/><br/>The bottom line is, this movie is phenomenal. Exploring the major theme of Barrie's play (that of a boy who never grows up), Finding Neverland refrains from condemning grown-ups, but exalts the wild magic one can enjoy as a kid. For James, who had to deal with his family's reticence upon the death of his brother, the real tragedy occurs when a child is forced to grow up too fast. <br/><br/>My favorite idea from this film is this: life finds a way to put into our lives the people we're supposed to be living our lives with. James and Sylvia needed each other, and they needed each other at that particular time. Life took care of them.<br/><br/>The film does indeed move at a snail's pace. Consider that part of the set design. Just as the characters go about 1905 London in top hats and buttoned-down gowns, so does the movie develop in a manner which would have been fitting for a time which preceded MTV-generation attention spans by about a hundred years.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it is wonderful. Depp is understated and gallant, Kate Winslet is lovely and tragic, and they're both better than I've ever seen them. Julie Christie is brutally ominous as the matriarch who can gum up everyone's happiness. Dustin Hoffman, although out of place, brings a dry wit as a risk-taking businessman. The boys playing the Davis kids are a lot of fun to watch and play their dramatic parts perfectly.<br/><br/>If you want something where all the pieces of the magic puzzle that is movie-making come together with grace, charm, and humanity, you won't find a more rewarding film than this."
"blackburnj-1","9","154","196","8 December 2004"," Superb Acting and Brilliantly Made
","Finding Neverland is one of the best films I have seen all year. Depp and Winslet are superb and their supporting cast is very strong in particular Julie Christie, Dustin Hoffman and Freddie Highmore. Forster's direction is tight and he maintains a story which had the potential to drag. Depp delivers a performance that is truly believable and he interacts with his co-stars well, in particular, Freddie Highmore who delivers a performance that outshines Depp's. It is a tour de force of acting talent. Clearly Highmore has a great career ahead of him. 9/10 for a superb piece of film-making, made diligently but, unfortunately, up against such strong contention, it had to make do with a disappointing award haul."
"mellowsongs","9","160","207","17 December 2004"," This movie totally changed my perspective on Peter Pan!!!
","**no spoilers** Finding Neverland covers a short period of the life of Sir James Matthew Barrie (the writer), between the release of his last play and his classic masterpiece Peter Pan.<br/><br/>This movie totally changed my perspective on Peter Pan. I was fascinated by the creativity of Sir Barrie. Seeing how the people and events around the author have inspired the play, and afterwards, how the play has affected them (Sylvia, her children, her mother and even an audience of all ages...) It makes you realize that even though the story of Peter Pan seems simple, it is rich with symbolisms and metaphors. <br/><br/>I don't know if this happened for real, but the 25 seat idea was an act of genius!! (This is all I can say about that without spoiling it for you)<br/><br/>When I was really young, I remember being captivated by Disney's animated version of Peter Pan. It had so many fascinating elements (for a young boy) such as: pirates, Indians, flying kids, faeries, sword fights... I was never tempted to get into Peter Pan again until today. Now that I know who the characters were based on, and their connection to Sir Barrie. But mainly because, Sir Barrie was true to himself when he wrote the play (towards the end, Peter (the boy) says to Sir Barrie ""you are Peter""). The author strongly believed that the power of imagination can overcome age, sickness and death, and he tried to pass it on to everyone, but most importantly to the people he cared about (when he showed Sylvia Neverland).<br/><br/>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie to anyone who would like to go back in time and meet Sir James Matthew Barrie and follow the creative process that led him to Neverland. <br/><br/>Great performances by Depp, Winslet, Hoffman, and the Davies children were very impressive; specially Freddie Highmore (the one who played Peter)"
"gradyharp","Null","232","305","23 November 2004"," 10 Stars! If you see no other movie this year, see this one!,
","FINDING NEVERLAND is that rare work of art that transcends the medium of film and becomes a spirit-altering experience. Strong accolades? Gush? Perhaps so, but squeeze time out of the clutter of life and the holidays to see this movie and be transported to a place that nurturingly reassures us that the cycle of life is indeed good. Find Neverland!Marc Forster ('Monster Ball') has created a lovingly tender look at the playwright JM Barrie (Johnny Depp) in 1903 when, down on his luck with theater flops, unfulfilled by a marriage of Victorian standards to a beautiful but aloof and social climbing wife Mary (Radha Mitchell), and with writer's block, he encounters the Llewellyn Davies family - a widow Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her four boys, George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Michael (Luke Spill) and Peter (Freddie Highmore) - playing blissfully in Kensington Gardens. Barrie is captivated, draws the boys to him with his patient and infectious enthusiasm for play, and bonds with this family, gaining the obvious seeds for his highest achievement or creation, PETER PAN.How these seeds grow, despite the soft, yet supportive, growling of his producer Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) and the not so soft interference of Sylvia's wealthy haughty mother Madame du Maurier (Julie Christie), form the storyline of this film. The magic comes from the skill of the writers (Alan Knee and David Magee) and director, the cinematographer (never has Victorian London glowed with such elegant gaslight presence), and the musical score by Jan Kaczmarek. Cameo roles are treated with tremendous respect: Eileen Essel as Mrs. Snow, Ian Hart as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Kelly MacDonald as the first Peter Pan, etc all are brief but fully realized and poignant. Given this support it is obvious that the talents of the lead performers will shine, and they glow they do with such understated performances that make the simple story of the sanctity of the inner child so cogent that there is not a dry eye in the house during the thankfully long credits. Johnny Depp continues to prove that he is one of the finest actors on the screen today: his Barrie has a flawless Scottish accent and a manner of movement and facial expressions that make him a gentle hero. Kate Winslet, never more beautiful, likewise embodies Sylvia with exactly the right amount of perk and pathos, and as her mother, Julie Christie is strikingly beautiful and unfailingly solid in a role less than loving. The boys are artfully recreated, never absurdly over the top, always very close to the bridge that crosses the craggy canyon between childhood and adulthood. Growing up has never been better portrayed - by all of the characters!In a time when too often films that address magic and imagination rely on computer effects to create creatures that are comic book absurd, FINDING NEVERLAND relies on simply showing the stage mechanics of the play, suspending wires and all, even in the climax of the story when Barrie brings his successful play to the living room of the ill Sylvia in order to keep his promise to her to take her to Neverland. No gimmicks here, just solid stagecraft very much in keeping with the inherent magic of Barrie's enduring play. This is a brilliant cinematic accomplishment - a feast for the eyes, the ears, the brain, and the soul. Please don't miss it! Grady Harp, November 2004"
"dbreazer","10","362","489","28 November 2004"," FINALLY! Sentiment you can swallow!
","I don't cry at movies. No eyes welling up . . as a rule. Okay, I cried during Henry V (the Kenneth Branagh version) when the French army slaughtered all the pages in the English camp. I don't even tend to care for movies that might make me cry. I spend my hard earned big screen cash on movies with big effects or epic vistas ( think The Matrix or The Lords Of the Ring) Finding Neverland was a glorious exception. <br/><br/>Beautifully acted, sweet but not syrupy and perfect for a break from all the holiday madness, Finding Neverland was a true gem. I don't believe its for as young of a crowd as I watched it with ( the 4 year old beside me was constantly needing plot clarification from her mother) but both my 47 year old husband & my 32 year old self were enchanted! In this jaded day & age it was a relief to see a movie that had romance without overt sexuality, a PLOT , and true emotion without sentimentality. And where did they find these child actors? Luke Spill, Joe Prospero, Nick Roud and especially Freddie Highmore were excellent. Rarely have I seen children perform on screen so realistically and charmingly. I'm sure they'll all have brilliant futures if they chose to stay in the business.<br/><br/>I would say something here about Johnny Depp but what is there to say? Besides, I'm biased- I've never seen a Johnny Depp movie I didn't like, & I'm sure I've seen every one! Julie Christie was a powerhouse playing a difficult character in the most likable way. <br/><br/>Don't let this movie slip under your radar! Finding Neverland will warm your heart without your having to turn off your brain. By the way, if you have a soul, take some tissues to use at the movies end."

","I had heard that this was merely a ""chick flick."" Hey, my wife is the one who wanted to go see it. As it turned out, I went with three other guys, and we all loved it.<br/><br/>Some movies entertain; some teach; some open up new worlds. This movie opened up new worlds. With each passing scene, carefully woven from the previous ones, it was like crossing yet another threshold into another world. The story unfolded deeper and deeper with each new scene, each layer adding not to complexity (the story is rather simple), but to the depth. Depp and the others (esp. the young actor who played Peter) easily lead the audience deeper and deeper into the paths of authenticity, healing, love, friendship and the triumph of inner strength. The other characters, likewise, garnish the central story excellently.<br/><br/>The only flaw I saw is, I'm sure, a matter of taste and perspective; I felt the grandmother was simply too two-dimensional and not as believable as she should have been, though she, too, had some beautiful moments that truly added to the film.<br/><br/>Having much experience with divorce (being a divorce attorney) I found the unfortunate relationship between Depp's character and his wife believable to a tee: two people deeply in love with each other yet more committed to personal pursuits than tending the difficult relationship we call marriage. Ironically, though Depp's character ultimately became the main caretaker of the four boys, by following the tender feelings of his heart, he allowed his marriage to evaporate by not following the other tender feelings of his heart.<br/><br/>Nearly perfect. I give it a 9 out of 10."

"alexkolokotronis","10","17","21","29 June 2009"," Finding Yourself
","I am not one to warm up to movies centered around themes such as this film. This is not because the idea of adults finding their inner child is ridiculous or immature to me. Its a result of films facing that theme also face a very big challenge on managing to correctly portray a transformation of an adult by children. Also if it actually extremely benefits the adult character in many profound ways. Most of the times films never succeed at this and are done so irresponsibly promoting dangerous styles of living that could be just as hurtful to others around us. Now the major question that is posed then, is why does this film succeed where others do not? What makes this film so precise yet so open? <br/><br/>With Johnny Depp as the lead character, James Matthew Barrie, you know he will be ideal for the role of someone inspired by creativity considering the unique feeling Depp can bring to any film. At the outset of the Finding Neverland, Depp's character is in dire straits to not only find himself as a writer but flat out just find himself. Eventually he does succeed at both through the help of three children he befriends whose mother, played by Kate Winslet, is ill. Depp discovers what he had long been missing, imagination and open mindedness. The children bring him that which is throughout is so wonderfully conveyed. His new lifestyle in no way endangers the people around him rather it enables his decisions to be more enlightened and thought out. Yet it still brings him into question. The cast is filled with talent ranging from of course Depp and Winslet as well to Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman. What the cast does not just play their characters, their characters are embodied by them all the way down to the performances of the kids.<br/><br/>Marc Foster takes on this challenge of an adult searching for himself with complete success. The writing and dialog is always engaging as well as the music and all the other technical aspects that go into making a movie. Still, remains the question what sets this film apart from others that attempted to be like it? Unlike other films this film is centered around youth equaling imagination and creativity. Not always is it a must to abide by the rules, maybe not the rule of law but the unwritten rules of being an adult, being a writer or any other sort of unwritten or written rule relating to anything. Nonetheless this must be done at a responsible and safe level which this film never fails to display. These rules can limit our creativity which limits the capabilities of our mind and ultimately drastically decreases the chances at happiness on any pure or genuine level.<br/><br/>Too often is youth simply associated with fun, stupidity and meaningless entertainment. It never falls into that trap. What this film shows is that we make meaning of our lives and this should start from our youth but not dissolve as our lives become further complex and self contradictory. Depp shows with his reclaimed youthfulness his life can only go up as does his happiness yet this is unjustifiably rejected by ""responsible"", ""sensible"" and ""mature"" adults. Depp's characters knows they are wrong through his writing and newfound appreciation of life but more importantly the people close to Depp know it and can see it to be true. In this way though, Finding Neverland may give us the key clue on how to find ourself."

","Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, two amazing performers. Now, throw in Dustin Hoffman, Julie Chrisite, and four adorable children and you're in for a treat: Finding Neverland; a story about a play write, Sir James M. Barrie, who meets a woman named Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, with four children, who doesn't have a husband. The family inspires him to write a story about children that don't want to grow up, evidently following the path of the story ""Peter Pan"". I really didn't expect to like the film as much as I did. I heard about it and was anxious to see it, probably for the fact that Johnny Depp was in it. I thought, ""Hm... story about a writer... whatever"", when I first heard about it. It didn't seem to be much of a big deal, but it is. I read about it on the computer to see if I'd want to go see it. It seemed interesting, but I wasn't dying to see it. I decided I'd wait until it was out on video. I was nudged by many of my friends to rent it and watch it, since they had thought it was stunning.<br/><br/>Three words: They were right! I watched it with lots of my friends at a party. Lots of them were goofing off at random points in the movie, but I felt hooked onto it. It was wonderful. I was pleased by Kate Winslets terrific and tragic performance. Johnny Depp was, as usual, stunning. He delivered a most sophisticated performance that was very touching, especially the ending scene. The children in the movie were perfect. Freddie Highmore was amazing. His acting was wonderful for such a young child. His performance was beautiful, especially in the last scene. If you see or have seen the movie, I'm sure you'll know what I mean. The emotions that wave throughout the movie are beautiful, and really touch your heart. Not only is there plenty of drama, tragedy, and make believe, but there's of course plenty of comical moments, too.<br/><br/>The film will most likely bore younger children, but I think teens and adults will find it quite lovely. This movie is full of beautiful use of imagination and delivers a sweet message. I think the ending was just beautiful, despite the fact that the screen was rather blurry, since my eyes were filled with tears. I remember hearing sniffles and seeing tissues being pulled out of their box from my friends as the credits rolled on. The ending is bitter sweet and very touching. This movie is magical, and I'm sure families around the world with think the same. Ah, yes, and If you found this review"
"ccthemovieman-1","10","17","23","16 April 2006"," A Deceptively-Good Movie, Better Than What First Meets The Eye
","I found this to be just as nice a movie as it was advertised. I've seen it twice as of this review and liked it immensely more the second time. It helped that I now knew Freddie Highmore from his subsequent starring role in ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" and it helped to watch this on my best TV which highlighted the magnificent cinematography in here.<br/><br/>This is simply a beautifully-filmed movie, stunning in parts, and a touching story that gets you involved and makes you think. It's nice to see Johnny Depp step out of character and play a clean-cut, wholesome-looking guy instead of some wacky weirdo. He did a great job of it, too, coming across as a very likable character: J.M. Barrie, the author of ""Peter Pan.""<br/><br/>The story offers an interesting dilemma: was Barrie an innocent friend helping out a family desperately in need a father figure, or was he ""out of bounds"" spending too much time with another family while he had a wife sitting home alone? The answer is the latter, even though the movie slants in favor of the former. Despite Barrie's good intentions, his first commitment was still with his wife. However, he was so good with those four kids in this film that it's hard to totally find fault with him.<br/><br/>Hightower is the youngest of four kids left without a dad. The older brothers are good kids and all of them are good actors. You rarely hear their real names, so here they are: Joe Prospero, Nick Road and Luke Spill.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet plays the mother and she, too, is excellent in this film. Radha Mitchell plays Barrie's wife and handles a tough situation in an interesting manner. Also in smaller-but-important roles are two big-name actors: Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie.<br/><br/>I really can't find much fault with this movie except that the first 30 minutes might be a little slow. If you know that in advance and stick with it, it's a wonderful and rewarding movie experience. Except for a quick one-second outburst in the beginning, there is absolutely no offensive language and anyone of any age should be able to watch and enjoy this. Overall, it's an interesting story of how the man who wrote ""Peter Pan"" came to do so."
"onepotato2","4","47","75","30 December 2004"," Barrie Reassembled.
","When watching this movie, with it's deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how Barrie's life played out? You watch it in a posture of disagreement. Hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore, they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics. If Hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you'd barely recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all-explaining, simplistic backstory. Your story would resemble ""Rocky"" because it's the only life-arc Hollywood knows how to produce anymore. We couldn't leave the audience pondering anything left open-ended as they exit. This movie doesn't trust an audience to figure things out without being led to them. I perceived the captain hook/mother reference eons before the movie literalized it for me. I could see the 25 kids twist coming for days.<br/><br/>This is a completely average movie. Not horrible but not great. Hence it's likely to be showered with a few Oscars next year. There's nothing the Academy likes better than congratulating itself for finally noticing patterns put in place over the previous thirty years.<br/><br/>From the New Yorker article ""Lost Boys"" by ANTHONY LANE: <br/><br/>""Arthur Llewelyn Davies, also adored his boys, and it may be unfair of ""Finding Neverland"" to omit him, for streamlining purposes, from the scene; by the time that Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, she is already a widow, whereas Arthur was very much alive when Barrie first entered the consciousnessand, little by little, the homeof the Llewellyn Davies family.<br/><br/>""Finding Neverland"" is a weepie. From the moment that Barrie met George and Jack, and started to ponder the means by which they might be rendered immortal, the story is sad, but the reality is even more dismal: 1907Arthur Llewellyn Davies dies from cancer of the jaw. 1910Sylvia dies of lung cancer. The five boys are orphaned; Barrie is made their guardian. 1915George is killed in the First World War, fighting with his regiment in Flanders. 1921Michael, an undergraduate at Oxford, is drowned while swimming with a friend. The two bodies, when recovered, are found clinging together.<br/><br/>On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davies, by then an esteemed publisher, threw himself under a subway train in London. We should not presume to read a mind in torment, but we may note in passing that, if he had lived another month, he would have reached the centenary of Barrie's birth and thus, one imagines, a fresh flurry of interest in ""Peter Pan""""that terrible masterpiece,"" in the words of Peter Llewellyn Davies."
"ga82","10","12","16","13 February 2005"," A beautiful and moving peace of art
","I understand it now. The movie on the play has to be many times more beautiful than the play itself. The play showed the beauty and freedom of magic. But the movie about the author of the play on the other hand, will show through the author's own eyes, the magic that he saw in the real world.<br/><br/>This is precisely what the movie has managed to achieve. It also shows that happiness can be found in just our imagination too. It shows that human beings though made cynical and calculating by the reality of the world would grab the chance to be in a world that has beauty, wonder and magic to set them free.<br/><br/>I have watched many movies. I barely shed a tear through any of them. This one had me sobbing. It is not all that sad. It's just beautiful."
"nick suess","7","10","13","25 February 2005"," fantasy within a fantasy
","This movie is a fantasy about a fantasy, and as such it poses questions as to how we should view it. As a work of art, it evokes wonderfully the 'belle epoque' that centred on the first decade of the 20th century, when life was still permitted to be beautiful before it was torn apart by the shells and mustard gas of the decade that lay in store. And it does so with characters who enter stage left, exit stage right, and deliver the occasional sensitively lit monologue along the way. The most revealing moment is a shot of barely a couple of seconds duration, when after bidding goodnight to his wife who has entered her own separate bedroom, Barrie opens the door to his and reveals the briefest glimpse of a fantasy landscape within.<br/><br/>This is Barrie's fantasy, and the whole story is Barrie's life as he would have wished to fantasise it. Perhaps least satisfying is his cardboard cut-out wife, whom we see portrayed as a minor hindrance to his creative genius, especially as she dares to express jealousy that he prefers to spend all his time with another woman. We don't see the jealousy of Sylvia's husband Arthur, who was sufficiently inconsiderate not to die of cancer until about 9 years after Barrie first met Sylvia, and who most definitely resented his intrusion into their family life. This emotion has been transposed into Sylvia's mother, whose antagonism towards Barrie somehow does a 180 degree flip in the five-tissue fantasy scene that brings Neverland to Sylvia's home as she is on her deathbed.<br/><br/>Viewed as a work of biography, it falls apart through its gross inaccuracies. Viewed as a fantasy, it really ought to spend more time in Neverland, where it really belongs. If it is to successfully bridge the gap it needs to establish the link and better explain why Barrie needed his frequent departures into Neverland, certainly going a little deeper into this than the bland statement that his brother had died. This had in fact been an utterly profound event in his childhood. His mother had referred to this brother, David, as a boy who would never grow up. It was David who was the inspiration for Peter Pan, and Peter Llewelyn Davies merely provided the name. Peter Pan first appeared on stage three years prior to Arthur's death, so it was not inspired by the tormented angst of fatherless Peter. That's fantasy.<br/><br/>Pretty to watch. 7/10"
"movieking1979","10","8","10","29 March 2005"," One of the best movies ever! Johnny Depp is excellent!
","Any fans of Johnny Depp you can't miss this film. I must say also that Freddie Highmore who plays Peter is very impressive as well. He is so serious and emotional most of the film and does such an excellent job for a child actor. No wonder Johnny Depp recommended him for the role of Charlie in the upcoming ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". If I could I would give this film a 12 out of 10, I would. From beginning to end you get so into the film wondering what will happen next. It's funny, serious, heartwarming and it is a family film as well as a film for just about anyone. I have seen a lot of films in my time and even though I am not officially a film critic as far as my occupation, I most highly recommend this film to anyone. You won't be disappointed!"
"IridescentTranquility","10","6","7","12 January 2008"," Sometimes we need some magic
","Being as I am something of a historical costume fanatic, I loved the look of this film. Quite often I see period films where the period costumes either look perfect but unflattering or have been re-interpreted, for want of a better word, (the recent series The Tudors leaps to mind) to give them some kind of sex appeal for today's audience. But Finding Neverland bowled me over with its wardrobe department - it has achieved that rare status where it combines the image of the typical Edwardian outfits with a kind of wearability and yet the clothes still manage to flatter ever character. Even the four small Llewellyn Davies boys look comfortable and natural in their little suits.<br/><br/>The cinematography looks similarly ""antique"", and I mean that in the complimentary sense. There is a softness to the look of the film, the colours look like you would expect Edwardian colours to look, nobody has quickly dipped a dress into some bizarrely vivid dye then put it on an extra and hoped it wouldn't be noticed. There is great attention to detail - when Barrie and another character walk down a street, even the extras are immaculately dressed.<br/><br/>Returning to the small boys, whoever cast these children made an incredible decision. They don't even seem to be acting, they behave - whether playing, arguing or just interacting - as though they really are brothers. It's as though they couldn't care less whether the camera is there or not. The set-up of their room - whether by accident or design (I suspect the latter) - is eerily reminiscent of the animated film Peter Pan. The moment when Barrie is summoned into another room by Sylvia's mother and one of the children pipes up, ""Is he in trouble? Because I've been alone with Grandmother and I know what it's like,"" is perfect - just the sort of thing a child might say. <br/><br/>Barrie's discussion with Arthur regarding the appropriateness or otherwise of the time he spends with the boys is something I half-expected. Perhaps then, as now, society's awareness of paedophilia has reached such an extreme point that we look for it where it doesn't exist. (I recall a similar quote from the commentary of another Kate Winslet film, Sense and Sensibility, where the writer and producer are keenly aware that the innocent friendship of a young man and a little girl of twelve would most likely cause panic and questioning of the young man's character if it occurred today. From what I have read of J.M. Barrie, the comments made by the real Llewelyn Davies family and from viewing this film, I don't leave with any impression that there was an inappropriate relationship between Barrie and the young boys but I think it sad that such conclusions are often leapt to just because some outsiders see a situation as potentially sinister.<br/><br/>What I felt Depp's Barrie gained from his association with the children was the ability to explore and indulge his ""inner child"" in a way that the Edwardian society he lived in would not accept and that his very prim and proper wife did not approve of. It was interesting and rather sad that Mary Barrie seemed partly to want to belong to her husband's world but knew she just couldn't access it as he could. It is almost like Barrie can see into the children's world. There is a whimsical quality to Johnny Depp's performance that reminds me of his character Sam in the 1993 film Benny and Joon - it has exactly the same light touch. <br/><br/>People often think writers, composers and other followers of artistic pursuits are prone to be a little eccentric. As an artist and writer, I love the way Depp's Barrie is so disrespectful of his own work and I can relate to the way the film shows his imagination taking over - I have had countless conversations with my own literary creations. <br/><br/>There were some genuinely touching moments in this film - I don't cry easily watching films and few have moved me to tears. I really believe you can only have this reaction to a film if the characters have been fleshed out sufficiently that you can empathise with them and in Sylvia's final scene (a role in which Kate Winslet looked realistically Edwardian and yet still accessible and aesthetically right to modern eyes) I was in tears. I also liked the way Mrs. Du Maurier softens at the end, realising she should have shown her daughter more respect - she could easily have just been a caricature, a stereotypical ""Victorian"" grandmother bossing her daughter and grandsons around and ignoring everyone's needs, but she wasn't. A lighter, but still touching, moment came when Barrie revealed what he wanted his twenty-five reserved seats for - the reactions of those audience members who were inconvenienced so that the occupants could sit down were priceless.<br/><br/>On a final note, in this world of ours where we're bombarded with technical wizardry and ever more complex expensive special effects, it should be impossible for me - a person born in the mid-1980s - to imagine how magical the sight of ""flying"" children would have appeared to Peter Pan's theatre audience in 1903, but somehow I not only understand why the audience find it so, but feel it myself.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have watched this film otherwise - I never saw it at the cinema - but I'm glad I didn't miss it."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","6","7","4 May 2005"," Very charming, very lovely, this is the most beautiful film I have seen in years
","After every single excellent review on this film, I had to see it. ""Finding Neverland"" is such a wonderful and moving film. The whole ending, I was just in tears. I don't think they were tears of sadness, but tears of joy. This movie just made me feel so good inside. I think ""Finding Neverland"" brings us all back into childhood for an hour and a half. What was so fun, imaginative, and wonderful of just having this innocence. As a child, we never had to really worry until we became grown up; ""Finding Neverland"" is a perfect example of that. I would always recommend this movie to anyone. It's the perfect film to watch with your family and kids. It's charming and absolutely breath taking.<br/><br/>10/10"
"shanfloyd","10","6","7","19 April 2005"," The beauty in it all.
","So when the screen went white with a small black ""The End"" written subtly in the middle, I felt the tear which tried four times in the past one-and half hours to roll on my cheek, finally did so. But I didn't feel what it was for: grief, joy or nostalgia. Whatever it is, ""Finding Neverland"" touched me like no other movie I saw this year did. And I don't think I know why. One cannot attribute this responsibility to any single aspect of a film like excellent acting by the whole cast, wonderfully written screenplay, magnificent set designs or brilliant cinematography to make Barrie's visions come alive. A movie such as this simply has to excel in everything to build such a strong emotional framework in the audience's mind. If any one is to give credit, the closest person is then director Marc Forster.<br/><br/>Today, when showing young-age imagination on movie screen inevitably means large bouts of special computerized visual and sound effects, it is a relief to see Forster depended primarily on detailed set designs and camera-work to achieve that. I don't know, but that seems paying actual homage to James Barrie himself. And what a treat that was. Every time the sets abruptly changed to make us see through Barrie's vision, when he played with the children or when he pictures Neverland to himself or to Sylvia, what I admired is Forster's vision. Just see this: when Barrie was playing the pirate scene with the kids in his cottage garden, it's all the ship, the rain, the artificially-made water etc on his (as well as ours) eyes, but every time Peter utters an out-of-place word, the scenes changed back to the cottage garden. Oh, how I liked that part. And when Barrie sees the children fly out through the window when they were jumping on their bed, that was perhaps the most beautiful scene in the movie.<br/><br/>If the credits for the visions of Mr. Barrie goes to Forster, that for the attitude certainly goes to Johnny Depp. Depp once again proves he is one of the few finest actors in Hollywood today. It's just unfortunate for him that he faces tough challenge every time he gets nominated for the Academy Award. Depp's J.M. Barrie comes with a calm, reserved yet strikingly warm and caring personality. And Depp managed that Scottish accent extremely well. And how nicely he fits into every character Barrie himself plays in his sessions with the kids. And he belts out some memorable quotes like no one else could have done... ""Just a dog?"" or ""See? The boy is gone."" for example and if you've seen the movie you'll know what I'm talking about. It is by far the best performance he has ever done, keeping in mind ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or ""Donnie Brasco"".<br/><br/>And definitely, it is the best Kate Winslet I've ever seen too. I haven't seen ""Eternal Sunshine..."" but Kate as Sylvia is much more masterful than even Kate as Iris Murdoch. She is one of the rare actresses with a physical beauty that really makes such roles possible now-a-days. And how glorious she looks in a simple early twentieth century outfit. Her portrayal of Sylvia is flawless in every aspect of the character: joy, grief, contempt or sufferance as a patient. Watch her when she asks ""What's it like?"" despite of her grief for her dead husband and her chest pain when Barrie tells her about Neverland.<br/><br/>But it'd all be wrong if there were not Dustin Hoffman, Julie Christie and Radha Mitchell for the supporting roles. Hoffman plays Barrie's producer with immense personality. He is intimidating, but never harsh. He is a realist, yet he believes in talent. And he is never egotistic. These traits suited Hoffman nicely. For Mitchell, hers was not the best, but she manages to do what she was supposed to do. But Julie Christie's performance is a real surprise for the film. I'd like to see more of her in such character roles.<br/><br/>All the kids did a great job. It's not feasible to point out little mistakes in their acting but I think it would be a little better if the eldest boy, George could be played with a bit more emotion. But let's forget that. As long as we got this level of mastery in acting, directing and script-writing (""He is the real Peter Pan"") I think I'd leave this review utterly without any kind of negative remark. Once again, it is a movie to watch in every kind of mental condition and definitely needs a second viewing. As someone else pointed out, if I see one movie this year let it be that."
"rapt2aT","10","6","7","4 April 2005"," One of the best movies I have ever seen!!!
","Perfection <br/><br/>by Amber Farnham<br/><br/>Johnny Depp puts on a Scottish accent for his new role as J. M. Barrie in Finding Neverland. It is an absolutely fabulous movie depicting the life of the famous playwright and the family that inspired his celebrated masterpiece. Filled with an excellent cast with perfect chemistry, this movie is bound to become an instant classic. J.M. Barrie is a famous playwright who has not been able come up with a decent piece of theater in a long time. That is until he takes his dog for a walk one day in the park. There he encounters the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (played by Kate Winslet) and her sons. They play in the park for hours and their relationship was forged. As he spends more time with the family, especially young Peter (Freddie Highmore), he becomes inspired to create a play like none other, but as he spends more time with the family rumors begin to spread that Barrie's relationship with the Davies improper. Believing these rumors is Sylvia's mother Mrs. Emma Du Maurier (played by Julie Christie) and Barrie's wife, Mary (played by Rahda Mitchell), but Barrie refuses to give up his relationship with the family and treats them like members of his own family. Life is wonderful until Sylvia becomes ill.<br/><br/>Her sons are forced to carry the huge burden of their mother's illness on their shoulders and all of them seem to handling it well, except for Peter. He is devastated by the recent loss of his father and hates the fact that the adults are not telling him the whole truth about his mother's sickness Sylvia's mother, Mrs. Emma Du Maurier does not allow Barrie to visit Sylvia or the boys, saying that he has done enough harm, and then Barrie's wife leaves him because he is spending more time with the Davies than with her. Through all of this, Barrie is able to write his masterpiece, and pretty soon it is the night of his most unconventional production, Peter Pan. Sylvia and her boys are rushing around the house trying to arrive at the theater on time, when Sylvia becomes sick again. Forced to stay home, Sylvia sends Peter to go see the play while she stays home. The play begins. The audience is awed by what they are witnessing and soon the play is over. At the after party, the audience is even more shocked to find out that Peter Pan is a real boy, the one who is standing there with Barrie! The ending, beautifully done, presents the viewer with one of the most touching scenes in the movie and a glimpse of Barrie's land through his own eyes. <br/><br/>This movie is one of the most beautiful pieces of cinematography that was ever made. The cast was perfectly selected, and they all gave the performances of their lifetimes. Young Freddie Highmore was excellent as Peter in this movie, and he and all the other cast members deserve every award and praise they might receive for their performances. I would recommend this movie to everybody. From the moment you sit down to the moment the credits scroll across the screen, this movie will keep you enthralled every second you're watching it."
"Naoum","10","6","7","18 March 2005"," The reparation of magic!
","This was an excellent movie with all the cast working like a superbly orchestrated cast with magnificent performances especially by Johnny Depp. Depp never ceases to amaze me with his hidden power that captivates me. The young boys were also very good at playing their roles. The boys' relationship with their mother, Mr. Barry and their Grandmother is especially moving.<br/><br/>The movie had a very touching almost healing effect on me with me actually bursting into tears. That hasn't happened in years (well almost), me being a grown-up male and all that. So, those who have forgotten the magic of being a child and of the fairies that guide them in their every step should let this movie remind them of the magic they lost on their way to adulthood. Neverland is the most magical place of them all! <br/><br/>Allow yourself to be enchanted by the spell of this movie and you won't regret it... You might start seeing fairies afterwards! Who knows?"

","Another great Johnny Depp film. A warm film about one mans great mind. The acting is great, story is wonderful, costumes are magnificent. The question is if the movie has any real truth in it...It is suppose to be based on true events but as always in Hollywood it is a bit ""hollywoodish"" if you know what I'm saying. I made some research on the subject and it seems that the main character wasn't the saint he is pictured in this movie. A lot of charges on his head including some loose ones about child-molesting. According to the articles I've read he didn't even have that good of a relation with the mother in the family. Anyway you have to see the movie to know what I'm saying. If you don't take any regards of what really happened this film is excellent. <br/><br/>So nevertheless you should see this movie!"
"wizard-70","10","6","7","13 March 2005"," Peter : ""I'm Peter, just Peter. I like my name.""
","I'm writing this comment right after I've seen the movie, because I'm so full of it so I can't stand it. I've seen a few movies about Peter Pan and I didn't like them so much. But this one is masterpiece. The movie consists of three parts. The funny childish part. The sentimental adult part. And the very sad part.<br/><br/>The first part shows young man who does not want to grow up. He's married, but he spends more time with the boys in park than with his wife. He likes to play. He dances with the dog and acts as it is a bear and has more fun than the audience watching him. And when he played the captain of a pirate ship? Who can be better for this role then J.D.? <br/><br/>The second part is about adults. Grown up people desperately trying to ""find Neverland"". But they can't. It's gone. It vanished long ago, because they had grown up. But a few of them still can find it and even show it to others. I liked Mr. and Mrs. Snow from this part. The old couple that still ""believes in fairies"".<br/><br/>The third part will make you never forget this movie. It shows the young boys confronted with the real life. When one parent is dead and the other is going to die, the children simply cannot be fooled. They grow up instantly, in the second they realize there is no room for children's games. When young George (Nick Roud) talks with James (or with his grandmother afterward) you see that it's not the same George who ""imprisoned"" his younger brother under the park bench just because ""he was his younger brother"". The young kid Peter had really taken my heart. I've seen him before in Mists of Avalon as the young Arthur and there he was very good too.<br/><br/>I cannot pick one badly acted role in this movie. Even the man playing the dog Nana was perfect. The young boys really outdid themselves. Johnny Depp was wonderful. And even all the other small roles were very good acted. So don't wait, go and WATCH it.<br/><br/>P.S. : Sorry for my English."
"marcin_kukuczka","8","6","7","13 March 2005"," The film for all that can still find ""child"" in themselves
","As I found out that Jan A.P. Kaczmarek got the Oscar for the music in this film, I went to see it. As a matter of fact, I partly ignored the content being predominantly interested in the music combined with scenes. However, when I saw Marc Forster's FINDING NEVERLAND a few weeks ago, I was touched into tears by the movie in general.<br/><br/>The whole story is very touching. The playwright, James Matthew Barrie (1860-1937), though an adult, has a soul of a child (played memorably by Johnny Depp). He writes a play PETER PAN and finds inspiration for this in family Llewelyn Davies and his relationship with children Davies(consider the moment of their first meeting and James dancing with a ""bear"", not ""just a dog""). He sacrifices most of his time for these children, including the most memorable Peter (Freddie Highmore) who is going to play the major role in Barrie's PETER PAN. A widowed mother, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), gets used to the magical world that James brought to their house. The play occurs to be a huge success... however, the mother slowly dies away...<br/><br/>The moving moments are particularly powerful in this movie. The most memorable of them, for me, personally, were: <br/><br/><ul><li>orphans coming to the theater to see PETER PAN. In the beginning, the people there seem to be annoyed, but later... the theater turns into a harmoniously joyful place for all.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the final moment and James talking with small Peter. How he consoles the boy is particularly touching: ""She is always with us, she is on every page of your imagination..."" And isn't everything so simpler when we believe? </li></ul><br/><br/>The cast give great performances, from Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet to the children, particularly Freddie Highmore as Peter. Fans of Dustin Hoffman will also have a chance to admire him in several scenes in the role of Charles Frohman.<br/><br/>The music by A.P Kaczmarek is very profound at multiple levels. If you like ambitious music in films, you will realize that here, it is in perfect harmony with every single scene. Great experience! <br/><br/>In sum, I will put it like this: FINDING NEVERLAND is not an average nice film, but it reveals one's attitude towards life and reality. It's a film about being different, about dreams that can be fulfilled ONLY if you believe.<br/><br/>Skeptical people will probably find it strange; realists will treat it as a nice fairy tale for kids; materialists will see no benefit in what the movie shows, particularly in what james does. Yet, all people who perceive the world through heart and their dreams through imagination and faith will absolutely love it. Only such viewers will find a reflection of their character in James, who, to the contrary of the world's trust in reason, has never lost the goal of achieving ... the ""neverland""."
"fanfare71","10","6","7","14 February 2005"," Loved it!
","I Particularly like the movie's imagination and generosity of spirit. It risked sentimentality, but its boldness of vision kept it on track. One tiny quibble; I'd have liked Barrie's troubled relationship with his wife resolved more satisfactorily, but I bought everything else in the story. It was beautiful to look at without being self-conscious, and the acting was superb, not only (as expected)the leads, but what a joy to see Julie Christie so splendid in her maturity. Likewise the four boys were terrific, as were the old lady who played Mrs Snow and the young lady who played Peter Pan. I'd rate ""Neverland"" my favorite movie I've seen this year, along with ""The Woodsman"". Bu the way, the boy who played Peter looked just like Kevin Bacon."
"aubreysparrow","10","6","7","10 February 2005"," Truly Touching Movie that will give you a Different View of the World
","Finding Neverland, a movie of the life of Sir James Matthew Barrie, his relationship with the Lewellyn Davies family, and imagination. All of these points were delivered perfectly. Johnny Depp portrays J.M. Barrie, a playwright who recently had no acclaim for his play. He needs to think of a good one because his impresario Charles Frohman is breathing down his neck. While in the park one day he runs into a perfect inspiration for his play, the Davies family, Peter, Jack, George, Michael, and Sylvia, the mother, which leads him to write Peter Pan.<br/><br/>Much speculation has arisen over the years that Barrie had an inappropriate relationship with the Davies boys, so this story would be short lived today. But with Johnny Depp in charge, he makes the character believable, and 100% acceptable.<br/><br/>And Kate Winslet delivers an outstanding performance also. With her Oscar Nominatated performance for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind behind her, it is amazing that she can come so close to rising above that. Barries love for her is not shown much, because he makes it so innocent. The drama in her life is kept to a low level, and the movie does not focus around that, even though she comes down with an alarming cough.<br/><br/>Also a surprisingly good performance comes from Freddie Highmore, playing the part of Peter Davies. This new actor most likely has an amazing carrier ahead of him, already done with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, again with Depp.<br/><br/>Another incredible point this movie drives home is imagination, with multiple references to it by Barrie, and multiple scenes such as a pirate ship and...I wont spoil it. Barrie keeps telling the boy to imagine things, by believing, dreaming, and making it real for yourself.<br/><br/>Honestly, best movie of the year. It was amazing, and do not be scared of the PG rating. Much better than Depp's performance in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. <br/><br/>I came out with a different view of the world, and I think you will to. It's a moral, wonderful movie, and is number one on my list."

In many moments, when we're watching it, maybe we can realize how simple it is, just because there's nothing totally outstanding about it, visually. But its story, is just one of those that carry you all along, no matter what. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this one, in fact, it shows adults some things also.<br/><br/>The characters in this film are as warm and natural as possible.

This is a man who has so much inside waiting to let go and show, and he has found the people to reveal these things.<br/><br/>Then there is acting. Johnny Depp is a genius, in everything he's ever done. He knows just, no the right, but the only notes, for the specific moments in this film, and in many others. How does he do it? Well, I don't mind to know if he continues to show magic every time he's on screen. Here he has given another performance of those he can only give. Freddie Highmore reaches some moving extremes, handling them very well, becoming the revelation of the young cast.

"curtman2","9","6","7","3 February 2005"," Memoirs of an Imaginer
","""Finding Neverland"" brilliantly and passionately chronicles the enchanting and fascinating identity of James R. Barrie, the imaginer behind one of the most beloved and inspiration children fantasies, ""Peter Pan"". The film deftly explores Barrie's many personal inspirations behind the making of his ""Peter Pan"", as his experiences with Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her adorable, remarkable children become the dominant subjects of Barrie's ideas, fantasies, and emotions. Take a critical look inside the mind behind the magic of ""Neverland"", and you will discover that his personal background was every bit as human, endearing, and enchanting as is professed in the ""fairy tale"", Peter Pan: Barrie is fascinated with the prospect of dreams becoming reality, and his life's effort is to somehow bestow his wonderful, magical outlook on life's whims and wonders onto the lives of innocent souls who might become better developed in life with these unfettered hopes and dreams. Johnny Depp perfects a curious Scottish accent to lend his eclectic, imaginative personality to the magical architect, in a way that impressively studies perhaps Barrie's idiosyncratic, quirky nature. One discerns that Depp seems to have provided a lot of study and calculation of Barrie in acting as convincingly passionate as Barrie purported to be, in his remarkably adept and human portrayal of this remarkably human character. This is definitely an Oscar-worthy performance, and Depp is so absorbed in his portrayal of this mystifying imaginer that if it weren't for an ""allusion"" to his recent Jack Sparrow in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (in imagination, Barrie plays ""surly pirate"" with the children), one would conclude that Barrie was the only role he was born to play. Kate Winslet, through most of the film, is much dissociated with the action, yet much immersed in the film's somber theme, as Sylvia, and distinctly grows into an important object of Barrie's heart and soul and compassion with the film's progression; a fine, genuine performance as a tragically disparaged, yet cherished, woman. As a film, this is essentially a ""theater"" of exploration, into the depths of hear and soul, and how it is sometimes best to ""keep pretending forever"" in order to evade the disparities of life, as Barrie apparently realized in his beloved ""Peter Pan"". This was a man who cherished the wondrous fruits of life, in finding companionship and inspiration with innocence (with the children, particularly Peter, who is inspired to challenge his surroundings to develop into his manhood), and realizing it is essential that life accept the notion that to ""never grow up"" and stay young at heart forever is to entertain your hopes and dreams, in flying to escape to an imaginary world, say, ""Neverland"". Perhaps ""Finding Neverland"" is at times overly sentimental in its message and excessively fantastic in exploring the realms of James Barrie (sometimes lingering too heavily on fragmented social themes), yet it is precisely adroit in bringing Te ""theater of Barrie's heart, mind, and soul"" into the conscience of a perhaps busy and disillusioned contemporary audience, who have perhaps yet to realize the spirit of this remarkable, fascinating imaginer who realized the essentials and realities in life through acquaintance, discovery, and experience: courage, hope, tragedy, development, happiness forever. ***1/2 out of ****"

","Sir James Barrie was a man who refused to grow up. In doing so, he lived in a Neverland world where children had a prominent place. Mr. Barrie thought the world belong to children.<br/><br/>Marc Forster has brilliantly succeeded in showing us Sir James Barrie, whose ideas were ahead of the times in which he lived. He plays homage to the legacy this man left behind, namely, ""Peter Pan"", the eternal hopeful story of what's good in mankind and how children will always know better that believing and hoping are the best ways to counter attack the cynicism around them.<br/><br/>The casting of Johnny Depp as Sir James, is one of the most felicitous details this movie has going for itself. Not only does Mr. Depp is a natural actor who shines in everything he does, but he goes under the skin of the writer and makes us think we are watching the man himself. Mr. Depp is at his best.<br/><br/>Equally brilliant is Kate Winslet. She is Sylvia Llewelyn Davis, the mother of the four boys that befriend Sir James in the park. She sees in him a surrogate father since the real one has died. Evidently the facts have been changed somehow by the authors of the play and the screen treatment because supposedly the real father was alive and well at the time they met Mr. Barrie. Ms. Winslet is charming as Sylvia. This actress conveys the idea of the love of her children and loyalty for the man that came to become a friend and a platonic admirer.<br/><br/>Julie Christie plays Sylvia's mother, Emma du Maurier, the bourgeois woman who resents the friendship between her daughter and Sir James. Ms. Christie has not had a big part in films recently and she does wonders to make Mrs. du Maurier to be the hateful person she is, until the end, when she realizes she had been wrong about Sir James all along.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell appears as Mary Barrie, the woman who was against the involvement between her husband and Sylvia. She is a complicated woman who will condemn her man before he is proved guilty. Ms. Mitchell is excellent also in everything she does, although she has little to do in here. Freddie Highmore is Peter, the young man who inspired the character of ""Peter Pan"" and he is wonderful as the confused young man until he is asked to believe by the man who was like a father to him and his brothers.<br/><br/>A delightful time at the cinema for those young at heart!"

","This film was truly magical and perhaps helped us to remember that there are truly wonderful people in the world. Neverland is an escape it is true, but could someone please show me the way to the door? Little Peter's performance was quite extraordinary and I do not seek to take anything away from Johnny Depp or Kate Winslett. Quite the first time that Julie Christie has had to take such a role (so far as I am aware). I suppose I have been in love with her since Far from the Madding Crowd...The garden backdrop in the scene before Kate's character dies has been created with enormous imagination. There really is nothing one can fairly say against this film - let the Oscars appear!"

","Finally, finally, I saw this movie. I had taped it on my VCR a few months ago but was hesitant to watch what I call a ""period picture"". You know stories about the wealthy, spoiled class of folks in England during the last century. Yes, it was briefly about this class of people but only because they were in the audience of Barrie's wonderful plays. His relationship with the children made me jealous; I wish I could have been one of them. Johnny Depp (who I think is a fantastic actor)brought the character to life in a quiet, subtle manner which added to the charm of the movie. I'm usually a fan of movies that make me think and become angry at man's disregard for his fellow man at which time I want to rise up and say ""Right on"". However, this movie ""charmed the angry beast"" in me and gave me the feeling that ""all's right with the world"". At least, at that time and that place. Today, I still feel the warmth that emanated from the play ""Peter Pan"". If only we could enter that world more often and forget all the ills of the world."

You can tell his heart was in it. So genuine and kind and that's why I believe he is one the greatest actor. He can play any part. Kate Winslet also was great and these two had great chemistry.

","Finding Neverland is a really great, powerful family film that discusses the life of J.M Barrie and his inspiration for Peter Pan. I never thought much of this film in the past despite positive reviews and Academy recognition. But I should have because it's sweet, heart-warming, emotional, and a perfect example of a family film. I would have never thought that the director of this film, Marc Forster would go on to direct a James Bond film.<br/><br/>Forster's film is about a failing playwright named J.M Barrie. He meets this family of a woman and her three kids as he is sitting in the park. He becomes great friends with this family and little did he know how this changed his life for the better and created a story so magical, that many children around the world cherish the beloved Peter Pan.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is really good in the film. This is a departure from his other roles of Jack Sparrow or Edward Scissorhands. He shows why he's better than people give him credit for. The guy knows how to act. Kate Winslet is really good as the mother and Julie Christie is great as the stern mother of Winslet. However, Freddie Highmore deserves the highest credit in his role of Peter.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very heartwarming story of a man who invented one of the most famous childhood figures of all time. I shouldn't have doubted this film but this is a true example of a biography. It's one of those rare ones that are safe for kids. I really loved this film and it will remain in my heart for years to come. I rate this film 10/10."

Freddie Highmore also gives an incredibly moving performance in this film.<br/><br/>For those of us who spend most of our waking hours as serious grown-ups focused on the many responsibilities and stresses of 21st Century adulthood, Finding Neverland provides an emotional escape and reminds us to treasure creativity and time."

","""Finding Neverland"" was really an enchanting tale for the masses to enjoy. Eight years ago at the theatres, I had the pleasure of seeing this movie and it was truly something you don't see everyday from the life in the fast land pictures that has infested the screens over the past few years. It is a rare find to see an exhibition of story filled with fantasy, imagination and an original story about the inspiration of J.M. Barrie and the muses he took in creating one of the greatest classical children stories of all time, ""Peter Pan"".<br/><br/>Johnny Depp stars as Mr. Barrie, a Scottish writer who falls through troubled times because his previous work was a complete bust. As he was walking through the park, he runs into Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four sons and they get together for a warm and friendly chat. As the film progresses, they start to get closer and it eventually leads Barrie to write his greatest work which would become a classic in the making.<br/><br/>The centrepiece of the film is on Barrie and his closeness to the Davies clan and by using his observation skills to understand children's behaviour, the path that led to the creation of ""Peter Pan"" and adding Indians and Pirates for added texture to the iconic children's story.<br/><br/>Marc Forster who also directed the 2001 hit ""Monster's Ball"" was behind the director's chair in this one adds magic towards the character of Barrie as we follow him through the whole process that led his masterpiece that is ""Peter Pan"". Depp was excellent in his portrayal as Barrie and the Scottish accent was spot on and his performance was quite sublime. Great performances by the cast, especially from Kate Winslet, Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman (he played Captain Hook in ""Hook"" go figure!). But the real standout was from Freddie Highmore who played the youngest boy Peter Davies and his bravado materializes near the end.<br/><br/>I truly believe that this was one of the best films that came out in 2004. If you've seen movies like ""Big Fish"" than this movie will surely please you."

"greyface7","9","3","3","9 May 2012"," Finding Neverland
","I don't know whether the events of Finding Neverland actually occurred or are fictionalized in this account of playwright J. M. Barrie's life. Forgive me for lazy journalism, but I don't care, and I don't want to know. A good film is a good film is a good film, regardless of whether it actually happened or not. And I can't help but think that such an lovingly crafted film as Finding Neverland - one with wit, wonder, and a sense of magic - is better left ambiguous.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays Barrie, the playwright best known for writing Peter Pan, as a true gentleman. He's charming and friendly, all right, but in true Depp style, he's also an odd creature. For better or for worse, Barrie doesn't live in reality: he lives in Neverland, a land of pirates and Indians and fairies. In everyone else's version of reality, he's an unhappily married playwright with a floundering career. In short, he wished he hadn't grown up. To this end, he's befriended a widow (Kate Winslet) and her family of four precocious children (Freddie Highmore, Nick Roud, Joe Prospero, and Luke Spill), who he spends his afternoons with make believing.<br/><br/>What strikes me is how well-meaning all of the characters are in Finding Neverland. There are no true villains or antagonists. Barrie is apathetic in his marriage, but he never stops loving her or wishes to divorce. Mrs. Barrie (Radha Mitchell) is upset with her husband's seeming affection for Winslet's character, Sylvia, but she gives him numerous chances to repair their relationship. The theater financier (Dustin Hoffman, in a fun supporting role) seems greedy and grumpy, but ultimately admits the play is genius. Even Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie), who's antagonistic towards Barrie at every turn, is acting out of love. It's pleasant to see a movie so lost in the clouds firmly rooted in reality, for in our own lives, is there anyone truly despicable, who's motives can be written off as ""simply hates the world""?<br/><br/>Finding Neverland's beating heart is Depp's relationships with Winslet and her most troubled and volatile son, Peter, played by Freddie Highmore. Depp and Winslet have no apparent romantic feelings for each other. The movie doesn't presume to create a romance story, but it weaves a heartfelt love story all the same. As Peter, Freddie Highmore displays a sense of vulnerability that's absolutely heart-wrenching, and, much to Highmore's confusion, Depp becomes a loving surrogate father. I won't spoil the ending, but it's safe to say that Depp, Highmore, and especially Winslet deliver poignant, heartbreaking performances.<br/><br/>The film is perfectly paced by director Marc Forster, and the music makes your heart soar while seeming as light as a feather; look for traces of perhaps Forrest Gump and Millions in the score. One of the additional delights of Finding Neverland are all the connections to Peter Pan. The play has never been better when bits and pieces are lovingly shown here, and Barrie's inspiration for the scenes and characters make for a remarkable game of connect the dots. A"

",". Given this support it is obvious that the talents of the lead performers will shine, and they glow they do with such understated performances that make the simple story of the sanctity of the inner child so cogent that there is not a dry eye in the house during the thankfully long credits. Johnny Depp continues to prove that he is one of the finest actors on the screen today: his Barrie has a flawless Scottish accent and a manner of movement and facial expressions that make him a gentle hero. Kate Winslet, never more beautiful, likewise embodies Sylvia with exactly the right amount of perk and pathos, and as her mother, Julie Christie is strikingly beautiful and unfailingly solid in a role less than loving. The boys are artfully recreated, never absurdly over the top, always very close to the bridge that crosses the craggy canyon between childhood and adulthood. Growing up has never been better portrayed - by all of the characters!In a time when too often films that address magic and imagination rely on computer effects to create creatures that are comic book absurd, FINDING NEVERLAND relies on simply showing the stage mechanics of the play, suspending wires and all, even in the climax of the story when Barrie brings his successful play to the living room of the ill Sylvia in order to keep his promise to her to take her to Neverland. No gimmicks here, just solid stagecraft very much in keeping with the inherent magic of Barrie's enduring play. This is a brilliant cinematic accomplishment - a feast for the eyes, the ears, the brain, and the soul. Please don't miss it! Grady Harp, November 2004"

The cinematography, costumes, locations and scenery are absolutely stunning, and the score gives the film its magical feeling. The script had its deft touches, the story had a perfect balance of the humorous and the tragic, and director Marc Forster deserves credit for making even those mundane events into something somewhat enchanting. The acting is wonderful too- Johnny Depp is nothing short of magnificent as JM Barrie as he alternates between being playful and sensitive, it was his sensitive side especially that made his performance so good. Kate Winslet is very tender as Sylvia and Dustin Hoffmann impresses in a smaller role.

","Powerful acting from an impressive array of names makes Finding Neverland a deeply moving film. The play Peter Pan is the shining light Barrie crafted to clear the shadows that clutter everyday life. The film, like the play, has a magical, translucent quality. Depp inhabits Barrie fully. The accent wobbles now and again with patches of Leith and Brigadoon breaking through, but Barrie's quest to show the child in us is the best of us is lovingly depicted in Depp's characterisation. Winslet, once again, rises to a challenging role. With outings like this and her stint in Little Children and Jude, she is inheriting the mantle of Streep as actress with the most range. We don't see enough of Julie Christie these days, but her rare gifts are all the more appreciated when so potently displayed. A great actress doing justice to fine writing - every word she utters is like cut glass. Hoffman cruises but does not disappoint in a role that seems to have been written for Jim Broadbent. And all credit to young Freddie Highmore - in such distinguished acting company, he elicits and earns our tears the most.<br/><br/>An air of sadness orbits Barrie, his child-like behaviour a counter-point to it. His writing, his take on life, are triumphs of the human spirit. Elegiac, life-affirming, and timeless, the movie embodies the life and work it chronicles."
"daddyo21","9","3","3","19 August 2008"," Great performance by Freddie Highmore
","Finding Neverland is about the life of J.M. Barrie, true. But at its emotional heart, what this film is really about is how a child deals with a great loss, the loss of a parent. Freddie Highmore plays Peter, the son of Kate Winslet's character, Sylvia, whose husband has died. All the other children seem to be handling the loss okay but Peter is sensitive and feels the loss more than his siblings. He is the emotional core of this movie. He inspires J.M. Barrie to write Peter Pan. This movie would be a failure if it wasn't for the wonderful performance by Freddie Highmore. I was really surprised that he didn't win an Oscar for his performance. As usual Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp are really good too but the film really belongs to Freddie."
"dead47548","9","3","3","8 January 2008"," An uplifting beauty.
","Some may call this epic tale of finding happiness in the most unexpected places to be too 'cheesy' or overly sentimental, but I'm inclined to disagree. In this day and age of modern cinema where every week there are three new films released that are gritty, hard-hitting and feature devastatingly pessimistic finales it's a wonder to find a film like Finding Neverland. Something so euphoric, uplifting and purely joyous. Especially when I've been hitting such a brutal case of depression, a film as optimistic as this was the perfect thing to get my mood in a state of happiness for the first time in as long as I can remember. Forster creates a fantastic fairy tale dream of one man's loneliness being cured by a wonderful family, who are full of their own flaws.<br/><br/>The story centers around playwright J.M. Barrie, played by Johnny Depp in the most perfect decision of his career, who is suffering a terrible case of mediocrity in his writing abilities. This lack of ability seems to stem from troubles at home where his wife Mary (the increasingly diverse Radha Mitchell) barely notices his existence and is far more focused on their social status than their marital one. In a wonderful meeting of chance, Barrie encounters the Llewelyn Davies family at the park one afternoon. This chance meeting turns into the luckiest experience of Mr. Barrie's life and also happens to be quite the blissful experience for the Davies' as well. We are then taken on a journey of watching J.M. burst out of his writer's block with the help of this beautifully imaginative family, and see that they needed his help just as much as he needed their's.<br/><br/>After a devastating loss of the families male lead, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (played masterfully by Kate Winslet) is left with four boys all to herself. Her slowly decreasing medical condition only makes matters worse and the film is filled with a constant state of approaching dread. Of course, since the film is perfectly magical, even as she passes on it's the beautiful imaginative hearts of Barrie and her four boys that help Sylvia leave this world in a complete state of happiness. With this wonderful relationship established between this family and this married man, we do get glimpses of the obvious tolls it takes on everyone's life. Barrie's marriage falls apart, he receives criticism from the community at large for the nature of his relationship with Sylvia and even the boys and Sylvia's mother constantly tries to bring the spirit of the family down. But it's the magic of these characters and this story that carry the picture on and keep joyous spirit alive.<br/><br/>Another interesting subplot to the film is the relationship between James and one of the Davies boys in particular, this boy being Peter (the inspiration for Barrie's title character Peter Pan, played by relative newcomer Freddie Highmore). Peter seems to be the one who struggles the most over the loss of his father and the addition of J.M. into the family life is one of painful sorrow and needed relief for him. He struggles with his feelings of James seemingly replacing his father and the lack of respect he gets from adults. This climaxes in a gut-wrenching scene as Peter destroys the faux-stage that the brother's set up in what is a brilliant display of acting from the young Highmore. Ultimately, Barrie takes Peter under his wing and teaches him the magic of imagination and appropriately helps him to find the infamous Neverland which represents the blissful place in your imagination where no harm can come to you.<br/><br/>I mentioned it before, but I would like to go back to Depp's fantastic and deservedly Oscar-nominated performance. The genius of Johnny Depp is clearly displayed in his decision to take this subtle and beautiful role after the eccentricity and wild charisma of playing Captain Jack Sparrow. His performance is very reserved, but this in no way makes it any lesser than his other work. In fact, I believe it to be one of the best portrayal's of his entire career and his best work of this decade so far. All of the performances in this sensational film are excellent (Winslet is another one to be remembered) but this truly is Johnny's show. A dynamic feat in what is now surprisingly one of my favorite films."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","3","3","3 September 2007"," The young kid of the cinema is ramming his way up to the top
","Pirates are Johnny Depp's curse for ever and even when he becomes a Lord in late Victorian London he manages do choose the author of Peter Pan and thus gets some Captain Hook to shake his hand. But his role is a composition of the best and most difficult type, the type of stunts you don't need a stuntman to do in your place. The film is a real gem for two main reasons. First of all because it is a love story in a time when love was some kind of forbidden goods in the aristocracy. And the love story is so pure, so beyond any doubt that he avoids melodrama when death decides to play his own game with that Johnny who invades the widowed mother's life a little bit too much. Dramatic but not tear-wringing. And the second reason of the beauty of that film is also the reason why it remains feeling intense without being heart rending or heart breaking. The whole film is centered on a bunch of boys and brothers and Peter is so young that we are amazed by his being so present, so good, so mature in his performance. He does not miss a word, a sentiment or an emotion and his so deep acting touches us a lot more than the obstinacy of Death to come and take away what he considers his owed property. And all the rest is nothing but the clothing and beefing up of that power. Johnny Depp becomes a real prodigy in this composition and he looks so serious that we forget the genial clown he is quite often in other films. Peter Pan is a legend and his author is like the Peter of Heavens, the guide and majordomo of our imagination who can introduce us to what real spiritual happiness can be. And we discover we are still able to dream because somewhere the film wakes up the child or even the baby who has never died completely in our life of needs and wants and remembers the cradle that a motherly hand was rocking in a regular and powerful rolling that has inspired our most intimate desires as soon as we were big enough to sleep flat on our stomach in an adult bed. Regular and religious rhythm of that rocking. The religion of coming out of the dream to wake up in a sunny world of pure tenderness.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

Johnny Depp wonderfully portrays the writer Sir James Matthew Barrie, more commonly known amongst children as the creator of Peter Pan and Neverland. The film shows that the imagination in this man definitely didn't die and produced probably the most successful children's adventure ever.<br/><br/>Depp is the standout through both his comical but touching performance. But personally, the acting roles of the minor characters shaped the film into a genuine movie. Kate Winslet induced a fabulous character to Sylvia Davies and especially the young actors of the children that meant the world to Barrie. In particular, Freddie Highmore (Peter Davies) I believe has a huge future on the screen. His emotional presence definitely held the audience (my family) to the credits.<br/><br/>In summary, ""Finding Neverland"" pictures a playwright attempting to hit the news through children comedic theatre with huge success. Similar to Depp's original acting choices, the film's title ""Finding Neverland"" didn't ask me to rent it. But surprisingly the movie brought me close to tears (a rare occasion) and should be rightly commended."
"jamie-pooh","9","3","3","5 February 2006"," - a terrific movie -
","This movie was one of the best movies I've seen yet. It's a very emotional movie - one of Kate Winslet's greatest. Also, Johnny Depp has shown another side of him that hasn't been shown much in other movies (Johnny Depp, well known for Pirates of the Caribbean). Here he is portrayed as a very serious, high-classed man, as well as a friendly, warm sort of person - very open towards kids. As the movie progresses he goes through many obstacles and challenges he must overcome - emotionally and socially. I've enjoyed it tremendously; is a great movie for any movie emo and a fan of these wonderful actors and actresses. A brilliant movie about a man bringing out the childish imaginations and wonder in himself and others."
"mxracer157","9","3","3","25 December 2005"," ""But I'm not Peter Pan, he is!""
","best picture out of the year 2004. this movie shows the true story of the Peter Pan character being created through the eyes of the author. Each of the child actors do a wonderful job. Watching them portray their fantastic creations and stories reminds each of us , or should remind us of the joy of being a child. Winslet does an admirable job forecasting a sick mother and looks hauntingly pale through out the story but as always is pricelessly beautiful. anyone that has ever acted on-stage knows the difficulty in creating a character. watching the cast from the opening failed play try to figure out how to be children, and pets, is a wonderful job of acting.Johnny Depp once again proves why he is one of the greatest actors of all time. with the detail and accent that he adds within his character, Oscar winning acting. This script is wonderful. the music direction is top notch. definitely a must have DVD to add to your home collection!"
"rbverhoef","9","3","3","5 October 2005"," A wonderful movie
","Here is another Johnny Depp performance that makes a movie worth watching no matter what. After 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and 'Secret Window' (that basically only offers the Depp-performance) he once again disappears in his character; this time it is ""Peter Pan""-creator James M. Barrie. Fortunately the movie offers a lot more. The story of Barrie is changed a little. Here the playwright, who just had a terrible release and therefore needs another play, meets the family of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet). She is a widow, left with four children named Peter (Freddie Highmore), George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero) and Michael (Luke Spill). Barrie is able to let his imagination go free, creating his own world together with the children. Especially the little Peter, perfectly played by Highmore, is more an adult than he is. His time with this family results in his famous ""Peter Pan"".<br/><br/>Barrie, who is married, of course raises questions. What does a married man do with a widow and what does he want from the children? The way Barrie is shown we assume he really wants to be a child himself, loving the children not in a sexual way, but more as his brothers. In fact, he loves Sylvia but even for her we never get the idea that he loves in the sexual way. The villains, if you can call them that, is Sylvia's mother Emma de Maurier (Julie Christie) and a little cough Sylvia is having. A funny thing in the film is the man who needs Barrie to write a new play, Charles Frohman. He is played by Dustin Hoffman who was Hook in Steven Spielberg's adaptation of the play.<br/><br/>The changes made in the story seem to be right for the movie. It is very funny from time to time, and actually moving when it wants to be. Besides the fine performances the movie looks very good too. Art direction, costumes and cinematography all add to the quality of the movie and Jan A.P. Kaczmarek's score fits the events perfectly. It is there, giving a scene strength without us really realizing it. 'Finding Neverland' is one of 2004's best movies."
"anddontblink","9","3","3","25 September 2005"," Amazing
","There are spoilers...but nothing too bad <br/><br/>Wow...just..wow. I absolutely adored this film. I love both Depp and Winslet as actors, in general, and they were both marvelous in the film. While Finding Neverland may not have been exactly the story of Barrie's life, it was astounding nonetheless. Maybe Barrie wasn't like Depp portrayed, but hey, whoever Johnny portrays makes the movie great. This may not be the best movie of all time. Actually, I doubt it is. But it left me with such a feeling of satisfaction that I would like to believe it is.<br/><br/>The way Barrie's mind is displayed, without him having to speak lines to say it, is amazing. Whenever anyone talks about the movie, the first thing I think of is the scene where he and his wife are going into their rooms, and his is a colorful nature scene, rather than a door. It makes me smile, and usually, after thinking of this, I start talking about how great the movie is.<br/><br/>The only reason I'm giving it less than a ten is the ending. It could have ended just fine in Neverland, rather than going past that. When that scene ends, you know what's going to happen after it, and it disappointed me that they played everything out.<br/><br/>But, in all, it's a must-see. It'll make you think, but you'll probably enjoy this kind of thinking. :)"
"tethlon4321","10","3","3","17 September 2005"," Beautiful, Enchanting & Magical...
","I never tend to write reviews, or even feel the desire to do one after seeing a movie. But, there are those rare films that you manage to come across, some by accident, and some just by word of mouth. This was a movie, I felt I needed to see, for the most part because I'm a huge Depp fan. So, I actually bought this before I saw it and went in with high expectations, which I rarely do. Without surprise, it surpassed my own expectations. Johnny Depp was again, wonderful as ever. <br/><br/>I fell in love with his works after coming across Edward Scissorhands. He's just good at what he does, there's no way to explain or justify the life and passion he can bring to whatever movie he decides to devote himself to. I also now know why he suggested the boy from this film to be in the new hit, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. This is one of those movies that just touches you, and if it doesn't, I'd be shocked. I don't think anyone can watch this and not love at least something about the magic it creates and lets enter your heart. (I'm starting to sound corny). <br/><br/>Of course, it is sad, but it doesn't leave you feeling depressed. It's just extremely beautiful and uplifting. I just wanted to voice my love for this movie, and how I was lucky enough to get a chance to view it. This movie was bought as a small birthday gift to myself."
"kevin142","9","3","3","18 August 2005"," Think like a child
","When we grow up, we cannot think like we were children. We are losing the ability of imagination. The exhausted writer James was in sagging spirits. When he met the family of widow Sylvia, he refreshed himself. Through playing with the children, he got much inspiration. Finally he wrote a well-known work.<br/><br/>The interaction between James and the kids was the best part in the movie. Every time I laughed as if I came back my childhood. In fact from a child you can learn much. The kids can be good examples for us. They are full of imagination.<br/><br/>The final part was unforgettable. When sick Sylvia watched the Neverland, the splendid place also touched my heart deeply. I think everyone has one's Neverland. If you really want it, it will come to you.<br/><br/>I think that Johnny Depp was the most appropriate man for the role. His character was fully in accordance with the role. His acting was impeccable. Kate Winslet also brought us wonderful performance. As similar subject, FN was better than Peter Pan (2003), Hook (1991).<br/><br/>One of the best movies in 2004. 9/10"
"godan0","9","3","3","12 August 2005"," Outstanding drama.
","I will make this short. Finding Neverland is quite likely the best dramatic movie in 2004. Johnny Depp plays a fantastic role, easily the high spot of his filmography. The movie its a brilliant journey to a man's mind. The very man who imagined the Neverland, and made us dream with a world unlike any other. Peter Pan sure is an incredible character after all. By watching the movie, my childhood memories were mixed up with some kind of an emotional spirit that drives the plot since the first minute. Finding Neverland comes out as an outstanding, spirited, heart-driven movie which may and will probably appeal to anyone. I highly recommend it."
"jimbethmag","10","3","3","20 July 2005"," Highly recommended for all family members 6+
","This is a wonderful movie. I can't recommend it highly enough. You don't have to be a fan of Peter Pan to enjoy it either. It's just a great story with terrific period costume thrown in and a wonderful theme as well. It is certainly appropriate for some younger viewers as there is no sex, no violence and lots of neat scenes depicting J.M. Barrie's staged plays and looks inside his Imagination. It also deals with the issue of death in a very mature way without being maudlin at all and without delivering platitudes, religious or otherwise -- and also without talking down to children (the Davies boys have recently lost their father when the movie opens)"
"Doylenf","8","3","3","9 July 2005"," A touch of magic...and some inspired performances...it soars like a kite...
","A behind the scenes look at a portion of James M. Barrie's life is given the sort of superb visuals one expects from high quality British films of this sort. The magic is there when the story reaches the part about Barrie's inspiration for ""Peter Pan"". From then on, the film soars like a kite into an enchanted land.<br/><br/>What I wasn't prepared for was the fact that the story takes a sadder turn when dealing with Barrie's relationship with the widowed mother of the four boys (who, by the way, are wonderfully played by the most natural and appealing youngsters I've ever seen on film!) But the balance between laughter and tears is a nice one, finely controlled, so that at the conclusion you've been rewarded with a really satisfying piece of entertainment and a new perspective on ""Peter Pan"".<br/><br/>The performances are all first rate, exceptional in fact. Johnny Depp continues to stretch with each role, nailing the character so perfectly that he hardly seems to be acting. The same can be said for Kate Winslet, Julie Christie (in a rather thankless but well played role), and, of course, by the magnificent child actor Freddie Highmore, who plays Peter. Not since Freddie Bartholomew has a child of this exceptional talent and appeal appeared on the screen. The chemistry between him and Depp is magical.<br/><br/>Despite the tear-jerker elements, a film the whole family can savor and enjoy right up until the final credits. The most magical moments are the theater scenes, but the cinematography throughout on various locations is awesome.<br/><br/>The pace is a bit slow at times but this is the film's only flaw. Most will fall under the spell of the storytelling right from the start."

","Having a son who is a filmmaker I try to view all the movies that are deserving of consideration of Oscars. This one was by far the most beautiful film of the year; the cinematography was awesome. This was lost in the cracks as a victim of the obvious politics that is in Hollywood!! Very disappointing results.What was equally frustrating about it not receiving more recognition by the Academy was that for a long time now there have not been very many movies that meet the interest of a wide audience...this one could be appreciated by all ages. Another appealing aspect of this film was that it allowed all of us to return to our childhood innocence and get so absorbed in fantasy that we were allowed to escape the woes of our not so innocent reality. So;I say, ""Shame on the Academy"" for not rewarding this film ."

Barrie's vision better than all previous attempts to date including the Disney Cartoon and the mediocre live-action film released in recent years. Freddie Highmore should now play Peter Pan in an actual movie of the character, for he captured the look and feel of the character in the book perfectly, managing not only to be merry and fun but also possessing a slightly sinister, sadder quality underneath.<br/><br/>Wait, I do have one complaint.

"mmrobins","9","3","3","23 April 2005"," Now I understand Peter Pan
","This semi-fictional movie about the writer of Peter Pan, James Matthew Barrie, truly surprised me. I knew nothing about it going in, something that I'm usually glad of, and thought I was in for another rendition of ""Hook"" with Johnny Depp instead of Robin Williams. I was confused as to who the characters were and why I should care about them for the first half hour, but as the relationships began to take form I was completely sucked in. Although none of the ideas were amazingly profound (growing up too fast, belief transforming reality, the importance of imagination), the presentation of them was magical. Even though throughout the whole movie they prepare you for what happens at the end, I found myself crying, something I almost never do at movies. I kept waiting for the fairly basic plot to become sappy and overdone, but it never really does, even with all the child actors. Johnny Depp is wonderful as usual and I find that I'm liking Kate Winslet more in every movie I see her in. I thought this movie was made more for children, but I think most of the subtlety of emotion in this movie will be lost on children, while adults may find themselves understanding their childhood a little better."

Barrie's recapturing of his own childhood (which ended abruptly when he was just a lad) through his relationship with the Davies family is at the heart of this film.<br/><br/>The 25 orphans that Barrie sprinkled around the theater for the opening night performance of Peter Pan have the same effect on the movie's audience as the play's.

Neverland was a very sweet, emotional movie that did not get bogged down with sappy, syrupy fluff. It had many wonderful lines, and the boys were perfect. Johnny Depp was amazing, as always, but something else too. He was, as I told a friend ""so cute"". And not ""cute"" in the usual manner applied to Mr. Depp. He was perfectly adorable, truly becoming Peter Pan--a little boy who never grew up. From my experience with his other movies, his pure-hearted role and flawless playing of it completely caught me off guard. Julie Christie was impressive as well, and I adored watching the ""cast"" of Peter Pan as well as Dustin Hoffman struggle with the childish play.

Visually the movie is very beautiful with top-notch production. Moreover, I'm glad the director avoided being too sentimental with the material. Instead, the movie develops with emotional scenes that carry real value in the characters and the audience. I also have to applaud Johnny Depp, giving a quiet performance that was very wonderful.

","What a what a wonderful surprise! This movie was a wonderful story from a small segment of the life of Sir James Barrie. Johnny Depp is outstanding as is Kate Winslet and Julie Cristie.<br/><br/>Barrie is a much more complex character than one would guess from his famous play or the book about Peter Pan. He was truly the boy who never grew up. But his ability to crate this magic world for children is exquisite. I am always amused by the way the British view ""Red Indians"" from the New World. They never get it right, but it is charming anyway. Captain Hood and the crocodile who ate the clock always amuse me. He included little girls in his adventures which wasn't always done at that time.<br/><br/>However, this story was about Barrie and his love of children and play. It is certainly not the usual picture of the dour Scot. I read in his biography that he never physically matured which may explain why he stayed childlike. Johnny Depp was outstanding and mastered his dialect perfectly. Kate Winslet was excellent, but certainly didn't look like a consumptive. Julie Christie was a surprise since I hadn't seen her for a long time. I hope we see more of her."

I just can't say enough for his performance. Kate Winslet as the mother of the boys that Barrie associated with was more than adequate. The one that nearly stole the movie away from Johnny Depp was the child actor Peter Davies. His acting was like he had been in rolls like this for many years. He is precious.

Yet it is brave; in repression in imagination, that shows the universe 'inside' encapsulates an entire theater of similar whimsy and magnitude. Its key exploring Barrie's romantic identity, though I'd conclude it's a small reading is its point, but one it makes a point in addressing. Basically because...the inside-outside is that romance and art functions as the same repression-expression, In stories... art, love and nature are always the enlightenment. So the film's initial basis is JM Barrie's motive so it's not unfair ground to conclude there is something there. Of course his nobility is its 'out' in showing him as harmless and longing to tap into purity and innocence sprung from pretentious bores being of use to no one. (Give the audience what they don't know they want.) But I could not ignore what the film itself was putting down: literally the couples retreat into different bedrooms not together; her into shadows, him into enlightened isolation of the mind. You can read that as imagination as proxy for the romantic, or you could read the impulse of love channeling into grand visions instead, as a pursuit beyond human understanding, as channeling the divine. ""Be disciplined and reserved in life so you can be savage in your work."" His presence then is healing and therapeutic by exposing them to this 'enlightenment.' See how the boy's emotional breakdown is destroying 'art.' The brave. ""This isn't one of your plays."" Sometimes Hollywood is so on the nose it achieves great insight. ""I've only wanted good things for this family."" Julie Christie wonders 'why'; -- from her perspective, he comes in, riots the children, kills the mother, for his own selfish pursuit. AKA the eternal as framing the inward through ritual therapy is uncomfortable for the repressed. ""The boy is gone."" It comes at a cost. See the consequences of 'art' as ritual payment for actualization. But the opposite is death by silence. Every one of them is envious of what Barrie has. See how her illness on opening night like cramping birthing pains. Art operates as this same inevitable force as life and death. How about the wonder of Dustin Hoffman's character being the second half of the spell. He doesn't understand 'why' but is deeply driven to do it. Both are so prim, proper and fashionable for 'why' requires our utmost. Notice how he never, ever intervenes. (The quotation of Hoffman as Captain Hook and Depp as Jack Sparrow were great.) As vivid and exciting as that feeling of something happening across it, the sorrowful sobering note it ends on is brave; the fade-out in Neverland with end text would have left a fine conclusion, but the film is interested in imparting the entire spectrum of wisdom, including art as both coming up short, as in it's not a process in therapy for the pains of living, but a form of living itself."

","I watched 'Finding Neverland' one Sunday afternoon. I could have never imagined a more wondrous, poignant storytelling of behind-the-curtain events which inevitably led to the greatest achievement of James Barrie: the much treasured 'Peter Pan'.<br/><br/>The movie follows Barrie (Depp) who, faced with a failing marriage and a writer's block, serendipitously encounters and is captivated by the Davies' boys. He indulges them with his powerful passion and enthusiasm for plays, and becomes more than a father figure to them, and in doing so gains the inspiration for his greatest creation.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's characterization of Barrie is worthy of applause. With a brilliant supporting cast, particularly Freddie Highmore and Julie Christie, the movie enraptures the audience, engaging them in its mellifluous narrative only to be left in a pensive mood for all its bittersweet and heart-wrenching moments.<br/><br/>This semi-fictional work of art isn't just a film, but a cogent story of cherishing the child within, capable of welling up the eyes of the driest soul.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","I watched this film and I totally got blown away by it. Johnny Depp is most convincing in this tale of true imagination! I am a fond reader of the wonderful story of Peter Pan and I truly adore the movies that express the imagination of the marvellous writer J.M Barrie.<br/><br/>When I found out they was making this film, I knew instantly I had to see it. 1: Because I love J.M Barrie and 2: Because I love peter pan! I love the story of a young boy never growing up and I love that it was an adult who thought up the idea. It was beautiful, the first time I read the Peter Pan novel, I cried. I cried because I finished it. Peter came back to see Wendy and she had grown, she didn't keep to her promise, but you know after finishing this book, she is still a child.<br/><br/>I think this film portrays the life of Mr J.M Barrie perfectly, the way he walks into the door and he walks into a imaginary world and his wife walks into a normal room. It was beautiful. It took me ages to cry, but when I thought the time was wright, I cried, this film is so emotionally moving, that it will moving any grown man to tears, and it will change any adults view of the world.<br/><br/>We all have an imagination, we should use it, I use mine. How about you? (If anyone wishes to comment on my review, please email me on, shuichi_shindosan@yahoo.co.uk)"

","I saw all of the candidates for the Oscar, and still feel that Johnny Depp and ""Finding Neverland"" should have won in the Best Actor and Best Film categories. Depp is probably the most talented and versatile actor in the world today, and the movie was terrific -- a wonderful addition to his brilliant portfolio. He is truly in a class by himself.<br/><br/>Also, anyone commenting on this film cannot ignore excellent performances by Kate Winslet, Freddie Highmore, Dustin Hoffman, Radha Mitchell, Julie Christie and others in the ensemble cast -- who have brought magic back to the silver screen where it has been lacking far too long. This film is apt to be considered a classic in the years to come."
"berlin_brigade","10","5","6","7 November 2005"," A remarkably moving story
","Fellow Movie Afficionados, I walked into the movie theatre: 1) to see two of the best actors of my generation (Depp & Winslet), 2) not having any background on JM Barrie, 3) not really even knowing the story of Peter Pan, and 4) not really ""believing in Neverland."" This protocol (seeking out films with good acting regardless of the storyline) has served me well in the past; I'm sure I am not alone in saying that there are occasions in which I am driven by a film to read the book or more upon which it is based. Although I later found that certain artistic and factual ""liberties"" were taken to tell this version of the story of ""Neverland"", I am not disappointed. This is a telling that brings to the foreground the universal truths and feelings that become more warm and hued -- if sometimes difficult to accept -- as one grows older. Johnny Depp is exceptional in turning in an appropriately subtle, moving performance as a man who can't be who his wife, theatrical agent, and other adults want or expect him to be. At least not until he meets a young widow (Winslet, in a poignant turn) and her sons, who adore and accept him just the way he is. I will not further elaborate on the plot; instead, I offer that, for those of you who are,like me, sentimental ""fools"" who spend most of their work-week as ""human-doings"" in an effort to project a hard-bitten corporate visage that may serve us well on the promotion ladder but does little to improve us as human-beings. . .this is definitely a DVD to buy for the Sunday afternoons in which you can take a private break from the rat-race, and believe once more that ""whatever lies ahead is nothing compared to what lies within."""

","I loved this film. It's probably the most normal character Johnny Depp has ever done. It was magical. I was laughing when the part with the pirate role playing came up because Johnny was talking like he did in POTC. By the end, I had a million different emotions inside me. I was crying and laughing. Felling sad because of what happened to Mrs Dacies but I also has a warm, cosy feeling inside me that I haven't had from a film since E.T. Ande in E.T. the feeling wasn't quite as pure. I'd recommend this movie to anyone. It's a wonderful film and, even though the storyline is quite basic, it transports you to another world (literally in some places). There's nothing bad I can say about this film. It has no language, no drugs, sex or violence. It still makes me feel great when I think about it. It's the perfect film to watch if you want to be transported back to a time of childish innocence. It's also great if you need to be inspired for writing. It definitely inspired me."

","To review a film like Finding Neverland, rather to APPRECIATE a film like Finding Neverland, you have to know what it sets out to accomplish. <br/><br/>It's clear that Marc Forster, along with practically everybody involved with the production, has a deep connection to J.M. Barrie's play. Because of this, it accurately depicts J.M. Barrie's life. Are there a few ""poetic license"" liberties taken? Naturally. As we all know, real life is simply not that interesting. <br/><br/>Forster's direction is amazing. The coordination with the cinematographer, along with his usage of grace notes (the tainting of the tea is brilliant) is perhaps the film's strongest points. The score, winner of the Oscar, is brilliant: whimsical while melancholy. <br/><br/>The performances are subdued, yet they still qualify as exceptional. Some on this board have criticized Johnny Depp. Most on this board are not bona fide film critics, nor am I. Even so, Mr. Depp gave an intricately laced performance, complete with a terrific dialect, while refraining from eccentric mannerisms. Winslet and Julie Christie are charming and, in the case of the latter, somehow lovable by the end. Hoffman is his usual terrific self, and the newcomer Freddie Highmore delivers a breakthrough performance. <br/><br/>The film's only weak spot is the very thing that makes it fantastic. This film will probably make you cry. I did. My family did. We all did. Some may feel manipulated into crying, and in a sense you ARE. Even so, Forster succeeded in making you cry or at the very least feel an overwhelming sense of awe and beauty. Not many films that I can think of, and I'm really racking my brain here, have been able to derive tears from sheer beauty rather than manipulated guilt. <br/><br/>In closing, this is a professionally done, admirable, beautiful film. It has its detractors, but I'd presume many of them are just too emotionally closeted to reveal their inner child. And revealing ones inner child is exactly what Finding Neverland does. Perfectly."
"laughing_cat","10","5","6","28 March 2005"," Beautifully Touching and Perfectly Cast
","Imagine a wonderful film with no violence, no obscenities, and no torrid love scene...FINDING NEVERLAND proves that, yes, it still can be done successfully in this day and age and stand strongly against other films.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp play the title role as the author of Peter Pan, struggling from writer's block after his last play flops. Kate Winslet is wonderful as Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies, the widowed mother of 4 boys and head of the family who inspire Barrie to write Peter Pan. Julie Christie is great as the grandmother you love to hate--fearful for her daughter's reputation, but also ""protecting what she has"" as she puts it during a strong talk with Barrie.<br/><br/>The 4 young men who play the Davies brothers are especially impressive. They look and act like brothers and hardly seem to be acting at all because they are so natural. Note that all 4 of the boys lended their names to the story: John (Jack) and Michael are Wendy's younger brothers, George is the father (and the oldest son), and of course Peter is the boy who refuses to grow up. Legend has it that Barrie created the name Wendy and it was first heard in Peter Pan.<br/><br/>Of course the stand-out young man is Freddie Highmore, who plays the young Peter from whom Barrie borrows the name of his title character. I think we'll see great things from him in the future. He'll be playing Charlie Bucket in Tim Burton's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. Johnny Depp will be Willy Wonka. These are great roles for Johnny, who seems to be defying aging himself. Who knows how FINDING NEVERLAND would've turned out if Johnny Depp hadn't been cast as J.M. Barrie? Fortunately, we'll never know.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman does a superb turn as Charles Frohman, Barrie's producer. Of course, we all know that Dustin Hoffman can do anything on screen, but it is fun to see him linked to Peter Pan once more after his hilarious turn as Captain Hook in HOOK, with Robin Williams.<br/><br/>If differently cast, with different editing, this could've been a very boring movie. It certainly doesn't play like most of the modern-day films. Luckily for the viewers, it IS extremely well cast and well edited and you'll find yourself wanting to find Neverland again and again. It is sure to become a modern-day classic."

Before this movie, I had just seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and I was amazed that it was even the same actress! She truly becomes each of her characters. I think she and Johnny Depp are two of the most impressive actors of our day. The child that plays Peter is a phenomenal actor, with a lot of potential. The storyline is very well developed and you get engrossed into the relationships of the characters. Everyone in this film I thought did a spectacular job. It's truly one of my favorite films of 2004. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in a talented film."

","In a word this movie was stunning. Bravo to all involved. This is truly one of Johnny Depp's finest performances but alas I think that as he has not already won an Oscar he will not win one again (I'm sure he does not care though, even if many of us think it is / will be a crime.) Kate Winslet follows Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind with this and shows her versatility again, an actress at the very top of her game. Also the young boy Peter was amazing. I don't have much more to say, just see this movie and don't be put off by the slightly slow start, believe me it doesn't take long before you are hooked. Go out and rent or buy the DVD when it becomes available unless it is still at theaters then go see it with a crowd. I guarantee few of you will find it less than almost magical.

","This is the kind of movie that can bring tears to the eyes of the most insensitive. It is brilliantly played by all the actors, particularly Depp, and it is brilliantly crafted and directed. I went to watch this with my girlfriend and I was expecting nothing, thinking that it would be a childish movie. However, after only 20 minutes I knew that I was wrong and that I was watching one of the greatest movies I had ever seen on a cinema on a long time. I also seen Million Dollar Baby, Ray, Sideways and the Aviator, and thought that they are all great pictures. However, Finding Neverland delivers something extra, it delivers a magic that I didn't think I could see on a picture again, since I grew up. Very touching, very deep and wonderful.

","I went in to this film with high expectations, which is usually dangerous. I fall prey to this action quite often, and have found that movies that transcend this predetermined experience are remarkable. Finding Neverland is no exception.<br/><br/>This movie is well cast, well written, and well acted. The cinematography shines above all. The foreshadowing is exquisite in that most, if not all viewers, do already know, at least, the story of Peter Pan. So the experience is not empty. When little details of what went into the play show their faces throughout the first half of the movie, every viewer feels like they're one up on the characters on the screen. But, the viewer also understands each portions of the plays relevance to what is being experienced in the film. It's a learning experience in both directions.<br/><br/>But, the heartfelt sentiment of this one man's love for this unfortunate family is ever-present.<br/><br/>I am a man who has no problem admitting that a film brought tears to my eyes. So, this film brought tears to my eyes. Tears of happiness and sadness at the same time. A movie that can portray these two ends of the spectrum so eloquently and honestly deserves a bid for movie of the year. I don't know if it will receive the honors, as I have only seen two of the nominees, but the nomination alone is very justified."

However, this is one of the most wonderful movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It's a movie with a heart that just makes you smile. Not because it's a funny movie, but it's just a very sweet and magical movie. You feel like you're in James Barrie's mind and that's very interesting, since everything is in one way or another fairytale-like to him. James truly was Peter Pan and this movie showed that over and over again. He was still a little boy and it's wonderful to see how he expressed that. His relationship with the Davies family was so extraordinary to see and I loved every single second of it.<br/><br/>Let's not forget the brilliant acting. I didn't expect otherwise from Johnny Depp, since he's my favorite actor of all times and he convinced me once again that he deserves to be called 'the best actor of all times' by me. Kate Winslet pleasantly surprised me. I always thought she was a great actress, but I never really enjoyed any of her movies. Now I had the chance to see what a great actress she is and I loved how she played her character and her commitment to her family. The children are all played by very talented kids and especially little Michael made me laugh, although I believe all three of them have something special. Like the boy that played little Peter. He was amazing.<br/><br/>I think every adult (and probably some teenagers too) will enjoy this movie and it might remind them of the little child inside of them. I give this move 9 out of 10 stars.

Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet give strong performances with genuine emotion, yet the most outstanding performance of the movie belongs to Freddie Highmore (Peter).

"lduperval","10","5","6","28 January 2005"," Beautiful story, beautiful setting, beautiful acting
","This is easily the best film I've seen in the past twelve months. As I left the theater, it dawned upon me that I don't remember a bad Johnny Depp movie. The man has a golden touch and he knows how to pick his roles.<br/><br/>""Finding Neverland"" is the story of James Barrie, the author of Peter Pan. It revolves around his relationship with the Llewellyn Davies family: Sylvia, the mother; her four sons, George, Michael, Peter and Jack; and Mrs. Emma du Maurier, Sylvia's mother. Sylvia and her four sons were his main inspiration for the characters in Peter Pan.<br/><br/>The movie is a particularly effective portrayal of what occurs in an author's head as he is developing a story. It shows how he takes little bits of his own life, and that of others around him, creates a metaphor for the events, and translates it into a story.<br/><br/>It also maintains the adage that an author must live through personal pain if he is to produce a masterpiece. In this case, Barrie has a difficult relationship with his wife. Try as he might, he cannot get her to embrace and accept the fantasies that inhabit his mind. Like Peter Pan, Barrie is a man that hasn't grown up. He lives in a world filled with Indians and pirates, crocodiles and sharks, fairies and flying children.<br/><br/>When he meets with the Llewellyn Davies family, he finds warmth, smiles and happiness that don't exist at home. He spends more and more time with them, at the expense of his wife. All the while, he is slowly crafting his masterpiece.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch. All the characters are believable and draw you into their world. I was amazed by the various children's performance. The camera work is dazzling. I especially enjoyed the way certain scenes alternated between the real and the imaginary.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that stirs a deep longing inside of me, a longing to write something significant, touching, and entertaining. I'm not one to buy movies but as the credits started rolling, my first thought was ""I have to buy this movie when it comes out on DVD."" Hopefully that will be around my birthday.<br/><br/>""Finding Neverland"" is a definite and very enthusiastic 10!"

","Ended up going to see this movie on a whim. I had no expectations, and found it to be inspirational. It seems like most living in this commercial driven society are used to structure; they are used to living the way society ""expects"" them to live. This movie, more so than revealing the story of how ""Peter Pan"" came to be, reveals a message for the need to never lose your imagination - it is what allows us to create our opportunities rather than choose among those created for us. Not sure that I'm onto anything either, but at the age of 24 I feel that this story also attempts to make the point that the only truth is love - that you can't know it - you can only feel it. Hence, you can't be afraid to feel; yeah sometimes the truth hurts, but fear is even more hurtful.......<br/><br/>and so my life's (up to now) philosophy is told, but in a beautiful way, visually.

"JohnnyDeppfloatsmyboat","10","5","6","18 January 2005"," The magically told story of James M. Barrie's inspiration for writing his most popular work Peter Pan is 5 stars beyond brilliant!!!
","Finding Neverland is a fantastic piece of work. The acting is amazing. Johnny Depp achieves such greatness in his role as J.M. Barrie. He does such a great job of illustrating subtlety, which is not only more effective and believable, but also harder to do. Also, it doesn't have that big blockbuster feel, which means the risk of feeling like someone is shoving this story down your throat isn't present. No, there'll be no choking down of this film. It flows with the greatest of ease. Depp's sheer and utter brilliance is complemented by an amazing supporting cast consisting of Kate Winslet, who gives an awe inspiring performance as Sylvia Lewelyn Davies; Freddie Highmore, who as Peter himself,proves to the audience, that he is quite the scene stealer; Radha Mitchell as Mr. Barrie's beautiful (and lonesome, once Barrie meets the Lewelyn-Davies family)wife; and Julie Christie, as Kate Winslet's mother. The film shows Barrie's good heart, through his various acts of kindness for the Lewelyn-Davies family. He gives them what they need: a trip away from reality, but by the end, everyone in the story learns, that ""you can't just go on pretending,"" to quote Depp as Barrie. The beautiful world Barrie has created in his limitless mind is more than just a place. It's a point of view: a state of mind. With a tear-jerking ending conversation between James Barrie and Peter, any human being with a heart will at the very least feel the souls of the characters drawn into their own hearts. It's completely absorbing and undoubtedly one of the VERY best films of the year. And finally, out of the most important lessons of all that are conveyed throughout the film, stands the one that applies to both reality and imagination: ""just believe."""

","In 1903, in England, the play writer James Matthew Barrie (Johnny Depp) has a complete lack of inspiration, and his last work was a deceptive play. When he meets the children of the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), he becomes friend of the family and Sylvia becomes his muse and her children the source of inspiration. James writes the successful play about ""Peter Pan and Neverland"".<br/><br/>This romanced version about the life of Sir James Matthew Barrie, the author of Peter Pan, is really a very beautiful movie. Who has not read the book of Peter Pan and the Neverland? Who has not seen at least one movie of PeterPan? However, the screenplay of ""Finding Neverland"" is completely original, showing the ""behind the scene"" of the creation of Peter Pan in a magnificent way. There are many deviations from the biography of James Matthew Barrie, but the wonderful screenplay highlights the essence. The story is touching, the direction is outstanding and tight, and the brilliant performances of Johnny Depp, Kate Wisnlet, Julie Christie and the children are awesome.

"jon.h.ochiai","10","8","11","27 March 2005"," Just Believe
","I finally saw Director Marc Forster's ""Finding Neverland"" on DVD. It is an absolutely wonderful movie that is so very touching. It is a great movie. It was one of the best movies of 2004-- very deserving of its Academy Award nominations. Johnny Depp as J.M. Barrie, author of ""Peter Pan"", is simply awesome. Depp again demonstrates that he is the most gifted and versatile actor of his generation. Depp has this mercurial air about him, and is so present in every scene-- he is just being. There is a breathtaking scene half way through ""Neverland"", where young George expresses concern about his Mother (Kate Winslet), and Barrie (Depp) acknowledges George (a very good Nick Rod) for becoming a young man right before his eyes, ""...The boy is gone. In just the last 30 seconds..."" Young Freddie Highmore as Peter Davies, the muse of Peter Pan, is amazing. Peter's on screen relationship with James Barrie is deeply compassionate and inspiring, and makes ""Finding Neverland"" a very special movie and experience.<br/><br/>Screen writer David Magee's ""Finding Neverland"" is based on the play by Allan Knee, ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan"". Magee's words are equally magical. ""Neverland"" tells the story of how J.M. (James) Barrie created Peter Pan in 1904. Barrie (Depp) at the time was a renowned play-write, who is in the midst of a dry spell. He along with his benefactor and producer, Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman, who injects a great light touch), have weathered a stage flop. Barrie must create something that audiences will embrace. Barrie develops a relationship with a widow, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), and her four young boys, George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Peter (Freddie Highmore), and Michael (Luke Spill). Barrie is married, and his wife Mary (a good Radha Mitchell) is not pleased that her husband is spending all his time with another family. Though their marriage seems to have died years ago. Also displeased is Sylvia's mother, Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie). By Barrie spending so much time with the family, Sylvia's value is depreciated. In a more contemporary sense people start talking about Barrie, in particular his spending time with the Davies boys. There is a strange and unintentional allusion to Michael Jackson, a Peter Pan fan, but that goes no further.<br/><br/>Barrie notices that Peter, who is at first resistant to him, seems in a hurry to grow up, thinking that things are less painful as an adult. Peter has taken the death of his father especially hard. In a stirring scene with Barrie, Peter tells him that he will not tolerate adults ""lying"" to him. That had happened with his father. Kate Winslet plays the strong Sylvia who is keeping her family together, and at the same time battling her mother (Christie) for her sons' futures. Kate also guards a secret. Julie Christie is a excellent as Emma du Maurier-- she is not at all what she first appears to be. This in part illustrates what is so special about ""Finding Neverland""-- it celebrates the very best in people. Freddie Highmore is the standout as Peter, though the rest of the Davies boys are amazing and such mature performers.<br/><br/>The last 20 minutes of ""Finding Neverland"" is so very touching and inspiring. I now will read Barrie's ""Peter Pan"". I finally got that ""Peter Pan"" is not just a fairy tale, rather a metaphor. We all grow old, in this we don't have a choice in the matter. However, if a part of us remains young, the part that makes the world always new and miraculous, not necessarily believing in fairies, rather remembering what that was like, then we grow old, without being truly old. Maybe that is finding Neverland. Barrie says to Peter at the end, ""Just believe."" That is well said. Forster and Depp have made something very special here, and have also made a bold request of the audience in ""Finding Neverland"". Just believe."
"LilyDaleLady","1","19","32","14 July 2010"," An appalling travesty of a film; built on misleading lies
","I think that ""Finding Neverland"" is one of the worst films I have seen in the last couple of years and certainly the worst I have seen with actors of the caliber of Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet.<br/><br/>For anyone who knows even the barest outline of the life of J.M. Barrie, or has bothered to even READ ""Peter Pan"" (the play, or any of the novels...and I do NOT mean the Disney cartoon version) knows everything in this film is predicated on falsehoods. ""Peter Pan"" is a dark psychological study in the form of a children's story...it's also a painfully honest look by Barrie at his innermost demons, especially his refusal to grow up and become a man. ""Peter Pan"" doesn't CELEBRATE the idea of refusing to grow up, so much as show it as the hollow refusal to mature and accept change.<br/><br/>As other commenter's have mentioned, it is widely believed that J.M. Barrie was a pedophile, with a seriously twisted interest in only young boys. He was obsessed for many years with the Llewelyn boys, and this was mostly over the objections of BOTH THEIR PARENTS, who were very much alive and married at the time Barrie met the children and wrote the play. Their correspondence survives and it clearly shows their discomfort with the intrusions of this adult man into their personal lives. Unfortunately, both parents met with untimely deaths due to cancer (not TB, as indicated in the death of Winslet's character), and the wealthy and influential Barrie was able to take custody of the boys.<br/><br/>There are those who do not accept the pedophilia of J.M. Barrie, because there is no smoking gun -- he was never caught with his pants down, molesting a child in the park -- but he clearly had an obsessive and abnormal interest in young boys.For example, he wrote thousands of love letters to one of the Llewelyn children, which the parents destroyed) On top of this, Barrie is believed to have been impotent, which eventually drove his wife away. There is not the slightest evidence that the real life Barrie had an affair or any interest at all in the adult Mrs. Llewelyn -- this is the worst and most misleading part of the film, designed to take the emphasis off of the unnaturalness of his interest in someone else's children. (No one in the film or real life bothered to question why Barrie, married for years to a beautiful and devoted wife, never had children of his own or even adopted any.) It is worth noting that the Llewelyn boys grew up to tragic lives -- two died in WWI, two of them committed suicide, and the one survivor considered the play ""Peter Pan"" to have been a blight on their lives.<br/><br/>Many people watching this have only the memories of the Disney cartoon and the famous Mary Martin musical version from the 50s (often shown on TV) to base their memories of the actual play ""Peter Pan"". These are charming adaptations, but in many ways untrue to the real play and novels (the earliest of which is called ""Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens"" and is a must read for anyone interested in Barrie or Peter Pan.) Like most great children's literature -- think of Grimm's fairy tales -- ""Peter Pan"" is actually a very dark and sometimes scary story. Peter himself is a conflicted and troubled character, not a little harbinger of joy.<br/><br/>Besides it's absolute dishonesty, and storyline changes that are not for clarity, but instead utterly obscure the true (and rather unpleasant) real life story, this is a terribly dull movie simply to watch. We only get to see bits and pieces of Barrie's theater work (he did actually write many other plays besides ""Peter Pan""; some, like ""The Admirable Crichton"" are quite good, he was not the hack he is portrayed here). The lovely and talented Kate Winslet is wasted in a soggy Victorian role that really should be done away with -- the beautiful girl dying of ""mystery movie disease"" (i.e., cough cough, she is dead). The normally very gifted Johnny Depp struggles here with the obviously dull character (his real life conflicts utterly stripped away) and he can't quite handle the Scots accent, which is awkward. I hate to criticize young child actors as their performances are often more a reflection of how they are directed, but little Freddie Highmore is terribly overpraised here for a very maudlin, weepy performance. He's one of these too cute, too precocious youngsters who seem utterly unlike complicated, prickly real life children.<br/><br/>It's a shame in the present day that we are apparently unable to handle an authentic look at J.M. Barrie, such as the excellent biopic ""Kinsey"" -- a film that was able to tackle a complex individual with all of his brilliance represented alongside all his flaws and failures. Instead, in ""Finding Neverland"", we are force fed a lot of sticky treacle about day dreams, never accepting adulthood and ""just believing"" in fairyland....perhaps in the end an accurate reflection of a society that can't accept the reality that a person can be a talented genius AND a pedophile at the same time."

","Based in the real life of James Matthew Barrie,the author of Peter Pan and the Neverland, this movie is beautiful and also make us know how the character of Peter Pan and the lost boys were created.( I would never imagined that it was based in Mrs Sylvia Llewelyn's sons.) Mr.James Barrie, a very famous English writer,was having problems with ideas: he didn't have any! All of his recent plays were boring,making his supporter have financial problems. Until one day, at the park, J.M. Barrie meets Mrs Sylvia Llewelyn Davies and all of her four sons:Peter,Jack,George and Michael; it was the beginning of a big friendship, who would inspire him to write his most delightful and famous story and also finish his wedding with Mary Ansell Barrie, being always with Sylvia and her children."

A very touching film, certainly touches your heart. Johnny Depp as usual played to the galleries, Kate Winslet played her part very well, Dustin Hoffman in his short role made his presence felt, the child playing the part of Peter was brilliant, the whole cast was excellent. This film has to be seen to be believed. Such films are a rarity these days and is surely going to make to my DVD collection. The director has done a fantastic job.

","Almost definitely certain to quite surreptitiously lead to the formation of at least a lump in the throats of even the most stoic, 'Finding Neverland' does an excellent job of tugging at the heartstrings, and pleasurably so, with no perceptible trace of melodrama.<br/><br/>The famous Peter Pan himself takes backstage, as the events leading to his conception comes alive in this well-crafted story about the struggling playwright J.M. Barrie's creative process, and his muse, the Davies Family. The relationship between them, and in particular the young Peter Davies, develops in bursts through the movie, as J.M. Barrie scripts his play drawing from his experiences, which culminate in the joyous and climactic zenith of Peter Pan's opening night. Inexplicably, the audience, and we, are drawn in to the fertile imagination of the playwright. As it comes to an end not on bed of roses, but rather on a bittersweet note, the best notion one could probably take away from this movie, is that perhaps dreams, however surreal, are worth having, if only for their ability, at times, to alleviate reality.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp delivers a commendable and understated performance, and is done justice by the whole cast, recreating Victorian turn of the century London for the viewer, in all its grandeur and social mores."
"BadWebDiver","5","18","32","12 January 2005"," Fantasy squelched by schmaltz
","This is a reasonably interesting and fascinating look at J M Barrie, and his relationship with the Llewellyn-Davies family, and his inspiration for one of the greatest literary pieces in English - Peter Pan.<br/><br/>The recreation of the original stage productions was very interesting and impressive. The actors playing the actors were very fun and sincere, and the whole backstage subplot was certainly a highlight of the film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has certainly come a long way in his career, and this role is certainly a demonstration of the nuance and emotional depth he can achieve in his performances now. Very dramatic serio-comedy with a large dose of imagination seems to be his specialty. I can remember when he was just a young teen magazine heart-throb starring in a TV drama show with ambitions of being a pop star. And I thought the oldest son George was very convincing and well-played, with another good performance that mixes light comedy and light drama.<br/><br/>(Spoiler Warning)<br/><br/>But this storyline is totally killed by the deadly slow pacing, self conscious ""serious"" drama delivery, maudlin story developments, and heavily clichéd ""big sentimental tearful"" moments. The final scene had me heading for the doors in stomach-churning nausea. In fact the whole final fifteen minutes or so just about erased the whole effect of the rest of the film, which I thought was rather tolerable. Let's face it; this script has ""pretentious award-nominated"" practically stamped all over it. It doesn't really say anything meaningful to a contemporary viewer. It's just a cynical exercise in emotional manipulation which is what's passing off for ""serious, legitimate, proper drama"" in modern cinema.<br/><br/>Sure, the idea that people need to keep their inner child and be accessible to the vivid imagination within is a commendable theme. But illustrating it with a sentimental character death and feel-good phrases presented by a weeping child is not the most creative or interesting way to present the idea. It's almost like we're going backwards to the sensibilities of the Victorian Age all over again. I guess Peter Allen got it right - ""Everything Old Is New Again""."
"hitchcockthelegend","10","4","5","18 June 2009"," He is the irrepressible spirit of youth.
","Under pressure due to his success, in a token socialite marriage, playwright J.M. Barrie is less than enamoured with his lot. Then whilst out walking his dog in Kensington Gardens, he meets widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies and her four young sons, George, Jack, Peter and Michael. It is the start of a long lasting friendship that revitalises Barrie and brings about his masterpiece, Peter Pan.<br/><br/>OK, lets get the grumble out the way, you know the one, the one that so many are quick to mention. No this is not a definitive take on J.M. Barrie and this time in his life. Much like Allan Knee's play, ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan"", from which this is adapted, there are liberties taken and it's most definitely chronologically unsound.<br/><br/>But this is not a biography is it? This is basically asking what sort of man conceived the magical world of Peter Pan? It's a celebration of childhood, life, whimsically asking us if it's wrong to keep the inner child in us all locked away as adulthood takes control? A tale of comedy blended with tragedy, from which glorious art is born to live long and forever, the kind that will be touching generations long after we have left this mortal coil.<br/><br/>Elegantly crafted by director Marc Forster and his screenwriter David Magee, Finding Neverland could so easily have given way to over sentiment and floundered in the search for emotional kickers. Yet it doesn't because Forster (immeasurably aided by the lush cinematography by Roberto Schafer) has created a quaint Victorian world, a world where fantasy is never far away. What emotion is here (and there is lots of it) sits perfect within this setting. We are actually being asked to be Barrie himself, the makers daring us to not be swept up in the magic being born. Wonderful, wonderful stuff.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Barrie, delicately fusing childish playfulness with inner sorrow, Depp doesn't put a foot wrong. It will be a crime if this multi talented actor doesn't finish his career with the highest acting honour on offer, the Academy Award for Best Actor (nominated three times, including this performance), it's practically impossible to imagine another actor in this generation nailing the role of Barrie like Depp does. Playing off him expertly is Kate Winslet as Sylvia, raw and honest like, it's emotionally driven and gnaws away at the audience's heart strings. Yet it's young Freddie Highmore as Peter that steals the show. Very much the film's heart, his relationship with Barrie has a grace about it, with Highmore (just 12 at the time) able to portray a subtle tenderness that drives the relationship forward.<br/><br/>Nominated for seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture), Finding Neverland won just the one for Jan Kaczmarek's poignant score. It matters not, because to me at least, this will forever be a personal favourite film. Something that just like Peter Pan himself, will never ever get old. 10/10"

I as being a writer myself could easily identify with Johnny Depp and his yearning for inspiration which he eventually found in the magic of pre-teen imagination and adventure.

Barrie, best known as the creator of Peter Pan. The story takes a few liberties with the truth, just like every good biopic always has done. There is never anything wrong with taking some liberties with the story, as long as it is good for the movie its story and main character.<br/><br/>The movie its story is truly magical. It shows in a beautiful way that there is a child in all of us and we should not be afraid to show that at times and stop wanting to grow up so eagerly but instead enjoy the little playful things in life.

The movie is not all joy, there also are some dramatic moments that work really well and powerful in the movie without ever going over-the-top.<br/><br/>The cast is impressive; Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Freddie Highmore, Julie Christie but perhaps the most underrated actor of the movie is Dustin Hoffman.

","Before I go on I must admit that I never saw this film in the cinema, but having now seen it an average of about 6 times and finding that it still manages to move and inspire me I really wish I had. Jonny Depp is amazing as the author and playwrite J.M Barrie bringing the character to life with his inspirational and moving pertrayal of a man whose childhood was raviged with grief with the death of his older brother and the regection of him by his mother that insued. When Barrie (Depp) meets Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Winslet) in a local park whilst writing his latest play little does he know that his life is about to change in a most drastic and unexpected way. Their friendship quickly blossoms and so does Barries relationship with her four young sons. He soon becomes a playmate and mentor to the young boys, who all quickly grow to adore him (much to their grandmothers disapproval and disgust), that is except Peter who is still grieving for his late father and is determind that this new man in his mothers life should never replace his father. Although there is never any indication that Barries relationship with Sylvia is based on anything more than a strong bond of friendship his life starts to take a dramatic turn as rumors about his relationship with the Llewelyn Davies family start to circulate and his own wife leaves him. Then when Sylvia becomes ill Barrie and the rest of her family are convinced it could be something serious but Sylvia just wants life to continue as normal. Then when it becomes clear that Sylvia is dying everybody realises that their pretence is over and it's time to face the reality of their situation, meaning the children must come to terms with the idea of a life without not only without their father but now without their mother. However Barrie still has one more trick up his sleeve to give her the send of he believes she deserves and to forfill his promise to take her to Neverland. When she is unable to attend the opening night of 'Peter Pan' the play Barrie wrote about their summer together he decides to bring the play to her. This will be their last evening spent together but Sylvia still has one more card to play and on the day of her funeral her mother reveals to Barrie that Sylvia's last gift to him is something truly special, something that will enable him to remain part of all their lives forever. This is a magical and moving masterpiece that I think should never fail to move, thorally recomendable."

Of course, Johnny Depp is my favorite actor of all time, but besides that, all the other actors play believable performances, as if you forget they're Johnny Depp or Kate Winslet (reminiscent of Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray Charles.) Freddie Highmore (who co-starred with Depp in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") is a promising young star who has much talent... I hope he'll go on to play more great roles. David Magee's script is beautifully crafted, and the cinematography and direction of the film under Marc Forster is beautiful and breath-taking.

More than feel-good treacle, we get to see how Barrie became disenchanted with England's stuffy culture and was inspired to write ""Peter Pan"".

","This is a good movie. Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, and the others are very good, as they always are. However, paying scant attention to the advertisements for ""Finding Neverland"", I got the impression that it was a fantasy story, but it is rooted entirely in reality. Some details are changed, but it is mostly the story of how Barrie (Depp) met and became an active part of the Llewelyn Davies family of boys, and through that involvement was inspired to write his famous story of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, and Neverland. The parts of the trailers (from scenes in the movie) where young boys appear to magically fly out the bedroom window are simply depictions of Barrie's imagination.<br/><br/>The boys' mother (Winslet) suffered from a respiratory problem (TB??) and died early, her will requested that Barrie, who had no children of his own, be co-guardian of her boys along with their grandmother (Julie Christie). History tells us that Peter (played wonderfully here by Freddie Hightower) grew up despondent that he was attached to Peter Pan and as an adult threw himself under a London Tube train after failing to inherit Barrie's fortune.<br/><br/>However, the movie, taken as a rather brief snapshot in time, the period where Barrie meets the family and gains his inspiration for his stories, is a very good one. The DVD is a nice one with an excellent picture and sound presentation, with interesting making-of extras."

","The boundless imagination of the man behind ""Peter Pan"" and the poignancy of his journey combine in this emotional tale inspired by events in the life of Scottish author James Mathew Barrie. In FINDING NEVERLAND, director Marc Forster (""Monster's Ball"") and an accomplished cast including Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie take a fictional look at the creation of ""Peter Pan,"" the classic of children's literature that speaks directly to the child in all of us. FINDING NEVERLAND traverses both fantasy and everyday reality, melding the difficulties and heartbreak of adult life with the spellbinding allure and childlike innocence of the boy who never grows up.<br/><br/>It all begins as successful Scottish playwright J.M. Barrie (DEPP) watches his latest play open to a ho-hum reaction among the polite society of Edwardian England. A literary genius of his times but bored by the same old themes, Barrie is clearly in need of some serious inspiration. Unexpectedly, he finds it one day during his daily walk with his St. Bernard Porthos in London's Kensington Gardens. There, Barrie encounters the Llewelyn Davies family: four fatherless boys and their beautiful, recently widowed mother (WINSLET).<br/><br/>Despite the disapproval of the boys' steely grandmother Emma Du Maurier (CHRISTIE) and the resentment of his own wife (RADHA MITCHELL), Barrie befriends the family, engaging the boys in tricks, disguises, games and sheer mischief, creating play-worlds of castles and kings, cowboys and Indians, pirates and castaways. He transforms hillsides into galleon ships, sticks into mighty swords, kites into enchanted fairies and the Llewelyn Davies boys into ""The Lost Boys of Neverland."" From the sheer thrills and adventurousness of childhood will come Barrie's most daring and renowned masterwork, ""Peter Pan."" At first, his theatrical company is skeptical. While his loyal producer Charles Frohman (HOFFMAN) worries he'll lose his shirt on this children's fantasy, Barrie begins rehearsals only to shock his actors with such unprecedented requests as asking them to fly across the stage, talk to fairies made out of light and don dog and crocodile costumes.<br/><br/>Then, just as Barrie is ready to introduce the world to ""Peter Pan,"" a tragic twist of fate will make the writer and those he loves most understand just what it means to really believe."
"seventenths","9","4","5","30 March 2005"," Believe the hype-it's true!
","I'm not surprised. Why you ask? Johnny Depp proved me wrong for like the 100th time! 6 months back when I constantly overlooked this movie in any film magazine, I kept thinking to myself ""is Hollywood that desperate for new movie ideas?"". Then it got multiple nominations, and then I was like ""is the academy made up of kids?!"". But now after seeing the movie (and not so reluctantly, I actually eventually gave in to some of the hype) I can assuredly say this is definitely a movie not worth missing. I won't go to the length of saying ""it's the best movie ever!"" but will contently admit that I was wrong for ever doubting this movie and it's merit. If you aren't a stranger to drama and don't mind a little bit of ""imagination"" don't hesitate when you see your hand reaching for it at the movie store."

","This is a great movie and I recommend it to everyone! It's a magical film that will make you feel like a kid inside. People of all ages will love it, kids will love it and so will adults. My family and I gather around in the living room to watch it together because it is a wonderful family movie and I highly recommend you to watch it, I feel in love with it the first time I ever saw it. Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Freddie Highmore, and the rest of the cast do a wonderful job of portraying their characters. I give it a 10 out of 10! If you could only watch one movie in your life-time I would definitely pick Finding Neverland! Anyone that believes in magic and has a very imaginative imagination will simply fall in love with this movie!"
"excrementa","9","4","5","29 March 2005"," What an exceptional experience it was..
","First of all I just have to wonder how easily a grown man turns into a weeping little girl. All I needed was to watch Finding Neverland. It left me wondering what the heck just happened? I can't remember crying in a movie for a long long time.. First thought that crossed my mind was: how gay was that? As I read IMDb forums I found out that I wasn't the only guy who had been crying like a baby. That was comforting..<br/><br/>That's how good Finding Neverland was. From the first moment that Barrie (Depp) started to introduce the Davis boys to the world of imagination and fairytale I was sold. Peter Pan is something we can all relate to. And maybe it's just me but I felt like the creators of this movie had captured the spirit of Peter Pan perfectly. For a moment the movie made me feel just as invincible as the book did when I was six years old. That was the greatest thing about Finding Neverland. It was once again a great lesson to remind us how important it is to never grow up. Anything that gets a grown man in a sentimental mood like that has to be great. Anyway the movie is as magnificent as hyped."

","This movie is the best movie i have ever seen in my whole life, and i have seen many movies. It just touched me in many different ways. It was magical and sad and it made you realize that without magic and imagination this world would be nothing, at least nothing exciting anyway. I thought Johnny Depp was perfect for this movie, he is such a great actor and shows such great emotion in this film. He brought the movie to life! I loved it and i hope to see another like it maybe even something close to a sequel. Though i'm not sure you could expand that one anymore it just said it all right there, and there was no other point to be made. It was a lively extraordinary movie and i would and will watch it over and over again. I could never get tired of watching it.

"loenigma_69","10","4","5","15 March 2005"," Fantastic
","This movie was fantastic. Not only was the story and plot fun and moving but with Depp it, of course, had that comedy quality but also the wholesome and serious quality that he brings to the Silver Screen. The movie reminded me of Big Fish due to its inspirational aspects. Movie's like these need to be played more often. I really enjoy action movies and exciting movies-those rated R-but, movies like this should be what people really want to see. An inspirational film of the imagination. I think that is what we need to get back to. Out of all of the ""Peter Pan"" movies, I say this one is the best. It is not the story of Peter Pan but the story of the man behind it. It really captivated me and it compelled me to look at my own imagination and want to captivate others. It really did. Again, this is the kind of movie we should really look forward to."
"Tyhoid_Puddle","9","4","5","15 March 2005"," simply awesome
","Finding Neverland, a brand new perspective of Peter Pan was amazing. The incredible Johnny Depp, as usual, made the movie even better, and the entire cast did an excellent job. For all those people that give bad reviews for this movie you must have your panties in a bunch because this is the real deal right here. I'll admit i am not a big fan of sentimental films but this was different in the way it was presented and the movie was so entertaining. No guns swearing and especially no sex and violence so the entire family can go for a change. I give this movie 9/10 because thats the best in my book. A MUST SEE!!! Johnny Depp has an effortless Scottish accent which is absolutely not easy to accomplish no matter how easy he makes it seem. The three children were all superb and added to the quality of the overall product. Even though this may not win any awards, it certainly deserves recognition.<br/><br/>MUST SEE 9/10"
"hath1","9","4","5","13 March 2005"," Beautiful cinematographic masterpiece
","I was hoping this movie would be good though I didn't know much about it before viewing, but it exceeded every possible expectation I could have had about the movie. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet give masterful performances, and the British children-cast does a beautiful job of making the movie believable. Dustin Hoffman of course also gives a great performance, though his character in the movie has a very minimal exposure, and is not very likable; yet Dustin again shows us he can assume any role given to him with no trouble at all.<br/><br/>The production team did a wonderful job in mastering the final cut of the movie. It is an emotional, touching movie which is not seen often in Hollywood in recent times.<br/><br/>Kudos to all the people who made this release truly magical! P.S.: There are a few ""tear-jerking"" moments in this film that will leave you feeling personally involved in the storyline, but also make the movie slightly more memorable."

"mbaldassi","9","4","5","6 March 2005"," A perfect title for a wonderful film
","This is modern film making at its best. While it was a treat to both the eyes and the ears, the story and the actors were what carried the movie. I had already held both Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet in high regard as actors, but their performances in this film have turned that regard to admiration.<br/><br/>As playwright JM Barrie, I was expecting that Depp would be a man searching for a child's imagination, but he finds so much more, with the love and compassion of a child unfolding in him throughout his performance. Perhaps what he does best in this film is he does not steal any scenes, instead acting as more of a vehicle for the subject matter. Seeing this movie made me want to watch Edward Scissorhands again, as Depp really seems to have built on that subtle style of his, and found brilliance in this movie.<br/><br/>If you want to find a parallel for Kate Winslet's role in Finding Neverland, just think of a woman in a desperate situation, who has a very pushy mother, who finds somebody that opens up a new world of possibilities. Of course, as we have seen in Titanic, Winslet is perfectly capable of playing such a role. But, like her co-star, she goes beyond mere capability in this film, and again it is done through interaction and subtlety, as opposed to overpowering speeches and ""heavy"" emoting.<br/><br/>Of course this interaction which is carried out so wonderfully by Depp and Winslet cannot exist without a strong supporting cast. To have four children do such a wonderful job as the actors who played Sylvia's (Kate Winslet's) sons, is a genuine treat to see.<br/><br/>As for the story, it is quite simply about finding Neverland, as the characters each endeavour to find their own Neverland in their own way, no matter how great or small. If you want to find it, if you're an adult who still takes to daydreaming, or if you just like the story of Peter Pan, then you will probably enjoy this film as I did."
"ciprian-cucu","10","4","5","4 March 2005"," what is the meaning of life?
","It's the oldest question in the book... What is the meaning of life? Is it to be rich? Is it to be famous? To climb up your social status? Or can we just live the day, enjoy every moment, try to inspire others without any interest in our well-being and in the consequences? This is what this movie has been about, for me. About being different. About not wanting what everybody wants, not seeing what everybody sees or wants to see, not being afraid to act childish and in someways stupid, letting go of one's imagination and allowing one's self to dream. This makes the film for me an excellent piece of work. The actors, especially Johnny Depp were great. Every one fits their role nicely and feels it 100%. The craziness of the writer for Depp, the business man / art promoter for Hoffman, the ultimate mother for Winslet and so on. The direction was also great, playing with the scenes, going in and out of imagination leaving me with only one regret: that I live in the information age, where all of our imagination is slowly killed by television and special effects. It's kind of strange when you think of it, but we now see on the screen what ""they"" saw in their imagination. And it makes me wonder if we have any imagination left... So go see the movie. It will make you at least wonder about yourself."

","My all time favorite movie. It honestly was amazing. I usually don't cry at movies, but I saw Finding Neverland four times and I bawled each time. Johnny Depp is my favorite actor and I've seen nearly all of his movies. He's amazing no matter what, but this was his best role I've seen yet. Back on topic, yes, I would recommend this movie to ANYONE. It's got tons of drama and comedy. Amazing. Johnny Depp does an excellent job. Kids would love it, adults would love it, the elderly would love it. It's a heart warming story. I wont give it away to those who haven't seen it. All I'm trying to say is that EVERYONE should see it. It's shot well, the story is great, how can you go wrong?"

How can he be so damn cool all the time.<br/><br/>I suppose most people have read lots of previews about this movie, but I guess that was kind of the point of this anyway so I will write it.. Basically, in 30 words or less, Finding Neverland tells the story of J.M Barrie and how he wrote Peter Pan. Great acting by Johnny Depp & co-stars, notably the young Freddie Highmore. <br/><br/>Anyway, if you haven't seen Finding Neverland yet then ... you should. Right now. Why are you still reading this??? GO SEE FINDING NEVERLAND"
"Fong_Chun_Kin","9","4","5","23 February 2005"," Convincing Co-stars
","If you think this movie is made up of only Johnny Depp, then you'll be seriously mistaken. Never have I seen Depp being actually outshone, at times, not just by one, but by two others from the cast. No doubt his presence is commanding, but his performance alone wouldn't be substantial enough to carry the entire movie, definitely not without the outstanding efforts by Kate Winslet and Freddie Highmore.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet has come a long way since her very prominent but not universally ""well-accepted"" role in Titanic. Frankly speaking, I thought she was crap. But she has really proved her acting credentials since then, taking on one challenging role after another. In Finding Neverland, Winslet touches hearts as a widow struggling to handle her four boys and her true feelings for the married Barrie (Depp). She brings the audiences along on her emotional journey and they in turn emphatise with her in her plight.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore is even more amazing; a young boy his age overshadowing the famous, Oscar-nominated Johnny Depp is truly no mean feat. Even Depp himself endorsed the massive potential this kid possesses. Forget the ""has-been"" Haley Joel Osment and the progressively irritating Dakota Fanning... this boy is the real deal. He is so matured and convincing beyond his years that you wonder if he's constantly possessed while acting. Or is he even acting? He is that scaringly good.<br/><br/>I've concentrated purely on the extremely strong cast simply because the film is really just about those characters. Finding Neverland is a simple, uncomplicated and beautiful biopic that tells a story as pure as Peter Pan the play.<br/><br/>Who should watch: Fans of simple story-telling through great acting; day-dreamers searching for more inspiration <br/><br/>Who shouldn't watch: Day-dreamers who have killer bosses; better not unleash the ""potential"" and risk getting the sack<br/><br/>Rating: 8.2"

It does not come off as a love story, but a story of discovery, adventure, and family. I dare say it is the best love story of all time. Finding Neverland made me feel emotions that I either have never felt before, or that I haven't in a very long time. It is safe to say that it changed my life. I won't add any spoilers...but this movie is a must see for everyone. If it doesn't make you feel, then I think it is fair to say that you don't have a soul.

","This movie takes you through the trials and tribulations of the man who wrote one of the most recognizable stories of our time (if not the most recognizable). I found the beginning to be a bit dull, and has a lot of informative things that may not interest most people, especially children.<br/><br/>The story does pick up however, after all of the formalities have been dealt with. This film will take you from being an adult to a child again, then suddenly wrench you back to adulthood. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has children that love the Peter Pan story, although it is a little over the standard six or seven year old's head.<br/><br/>I will admit that this movie can make the tears come forth, not so much as to cause a room full of balling babies, but they're there. This tale will take you to places that you have not been since childhood, it can cause a great deal of memories to come flooding back after it has finished (though I may be in a bias position, certain things in it ring very close to home for me) I would have to guess that this film will win best picture.<br/><br/>What can one say about Johnny Depp... splendid performance as usual, however, the most commanding performance was not by someone we all know! It was by a young man named Freddie Highmore, not since ""The Sixth Sense"" (Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear) have I seen an actor so young land their role so perfectly.<br/><br/>I give ""Finding Neverland"" a 9 out of 10"

Of course it made me wonder about the reality of this compared to other ""peter pan"" stories that are out there. I now will be doing some more research into this to see what I can find out. Did this really happen? Were there really these kids? My curiosity gets the better of me now. Overall it was a great movie and I enjoyed it. I would recommend this movie to others who enjoy a good ""fairy tale"" type story."

","This is without a doubt one of Jonny Depp's finest performances. He shows us a man of many characters within and without. Although we do not find out as much about the man as a biography we do get a glimpse of the period of time he wrote Peter Pan. This story of that period of time in J. M. Barries life brings many exciting insights to a tale most of us know. The supporting cast has quite a job and does it admirably. Just keeping pace with Depp's energy is a daunting exploit. A movie that you can bring the whole family to and not worry about scenes that would be objectionable in any way. I highly recommend bringing a box of tissues with you. You will be having tears of joy..."

"alexsaba","10","4","5","14 February 2005"," A great ""new"" director
","First of all, I like the work of Mr.Deep. I saw many movies with him and always great movies and ""Deadman"" is one of my favorites. Now I can go on.<br/><br/>I will saw this movie because of Mr.Deep, but also I'm was curious about the man who create Peter Pan. As a 47 old man Dysney's Peter Pan was very important when I was a child, but as a composer and writer, I'm an always curious about the creative process behind each master piece and the life of the creators.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland was one of those movies when I lost the floor or pull my carpet. I was not prepared to see something like that. Create is a delicate process. Many times I discovered myself drowned in inner thoughts while reality around me continuous gives me feedback, but it seems I'm not connected. I saw all of that in the big screen.<br/><br/>There are few movies without murders, blood, fear or sex today. It's difficult to see and to tell a story about real people and the great here is the mix of reality and dream, like a child playing. I don't like to use the word ""great"" a lot, but sensibility is the key. The world seems to lost it's own. The old ones forgot to play, to dream and to share.<br/><br/>Mr.Marc Foster had the ability to give us all of this in a movie that seems simple. A movie where the special effects don't block the view from the story. I remembered the delicate movies of Truffaut and others European directors.<br/><br/>Mr.Deep was great as the dreamer, the obstinate writer and builder of a bridge between dream and reality and also as the man, not so fragile as in other roles.<br/><br/>I can't remember about a movie in the last years when I have no words immediately after the end. I stayed with my wife seeing the credits (as usually we do) but we don't want to leave the room. We wanted to stay and see it again, but reality knocks our door and we return from a deep dive. Three hours after seeing it I'm still moved. It seems I know a bit more about myself after this movie and I didn't feel something like that since my 20's.<br/><br/>Nice feelings...great feelings."

This film is silent, beautiful, full of grace and big feelings, never loud and really heartbreaking. I think everybody of us, who just forgot how to dream and what dreams, fantasy can build, had to see that film. Just to remember to see the world with our children's eyes. This film made perfect what Tim Burton begins with ""Big Fish"" and for me, this film is one of my favorites. Just entered my top ten in just some wonderful minutes.

With average child actors, a talented adult cast, and most important, the one and only Johnny Depp. But, Finding Neverland is much more than that.<br/><br/>It starts with Johnny portraying the legendary J.M. Barrie. He has not had much luck with his recent plays that send even the most important people in London off to sleep. He needs some inspiration, and that just happens to come from a family he finds in the park one day. The Davies brothers just lost their father due to cancer of the jaw.<br/><br/>Their mother, Sylvia( Kate Winslet) is having a tough time making ends meet. George(Nick Roud), Jack(Joe Prospero) and Michael (Luke Spill) have begun getting over their father's death. Peter (Freddie Highmore), the second youngest, is still mourning. One look at Freddie and you're blown away. He acts like someone with 20 years of experience. When J.M. (""James"") decides to put on a fantastical show with his dog pretending to be a circus bear, the other boys are thrilled, while Peter says ""it's just a dog.""<br/><br/>James quickly becomes very dear to the Davies. Everyone except their Grandmother(Julie Christie), who does not believe that a widow should be around a married man, especially when his relationship with his wife is not going well. Sylvia does not listen to her mother and has James over often. It is best for Peter, for he is slowly warming up to James.<br/><br/>Throughout his time with the Davies, James has begun writing a masterpiece, Peter Pan. He soon submits the script to Charles Frohman(Dustin Hoffman), the producer of his plays. Charles is desperate for a success, and accepts it, even though he thinks that it's rubbish. It turns out to be the best choice of his life.<br/><br/>This film is like you were watching the first showing of Peter Pan. The cast is superb, the direction is amazing, the screenplay is incredible. Everything flows perfectly. There isn't one part I would change. This is one of the best films I've seen and I'm sure it will remain that way for many years. Grade A"

This movie has reformed me.<br/><br/>The way I view films relies almost singularly on one set of criteria: where are the flaws, how many are there, and can they be forgiven/overlooked? Finding Neverland destroyed my method beyond all repair. It was a bit like inserting a metal rod into a wood chipper. <br/><br/>Where are the flaws? What flaws? How many are there? There are none to be found. Can they be forgiven?

It's like being a millionaire for only 2 glorious hours only to be forced back into our sad, wretched lives.<br/><br/>You owe it to your children (I would suggest ages 8+ because some scenes are just too powerful for young minds) to take them to see this movie. Heck, you owe it to yourselves. I defy you to endure the entirety of this movie with dry eyes. I defy you to walk out of the theater without a knot in your stomach or a lump in your throat.

Depp is a master. I don't say that lightly.<br/><br/>The movie is heartwarming. The actor who played real-life Peter did a marvelous job with his character. Child actors rarely have that sort of skill express itself so early.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet is well cast.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a winner through and through.<br/><br/>My wife did not want to see this movie thinking it would be a fantasy, etc. She loved the movie and was moved to tears with the poignant ending."

","This is the second movie I watched in yesterday's 3 movie marathon.<br/><br/>Who would've thought that even James Matthew Barrie can get writer's block and his latest play proved to be such a bore. The film opens with high English society going a cinema of yesteryear - the theatre - and by the end of it, JM Barrie knew he needed something special to stay at the top of his game.<br/><br/>Chance allowed him to meet a widower with 4 boys, and needless to say, their life experiences together form the basis of his most famous work - Peter Pan. However, through spending much time with this family, his own loveless marriage spun out of control, while at the same time, he finds new meaning in life with his teaching of imagination and escapism to his new surrogate family.<br/><br/>This film briefly explores the nuances of high society in the Victorian age, as things like these set tongues wagging, and is equivalent to the current day scandals. We're also treated to a behind the scenes look at how the theatre group pulls off the fantasy elements of the play - you'd have to believe it's there, and Barries' masterstroke in inviting orphans to the premiere of Peter Pan.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does it again with his top notch acting. He's one of the few character actors around, and takes his performance to another new level. This film, given Barrie's encouraging use of imagination, allows Depp to showcase multiple roles when he plays with the kids, and one which audiences immediately identify with, is the shade of Captain Jack Sparrow when he portrays a pirate.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet does a commendable job as the children's mom in a single parent family, being the strong pillar to 4 young boys, and yet, being so vulnerable because of a critical illness.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman chews up his scenes, and the best irony comes in his initial disbelief that Peter Pan can pull it off (There are some of you who remembered that he played Captain Hook in Spielberg's Hook) This is a nice touching drama on soaring life with imagination, the background tale behind the boy who never grew up, and ladies, be prepared to bring some tissues for this one - even my eyes did well at the end of this one."

Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet provide superb performances and if they don't get at least nominations for Academy Awards, then the Academy needs new members. Johnny Depp gives his best performance to date, proving that not only can he act in the quirky films that he has done so far, but he can also carry and perform a straight actor in a drama such as this. Depp's performance is one of the highlights of this movie, as he brings J.M. Barrie to life. The little boy who plays Peter in this movie is a phenomenal actor for such a young child.

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Never have I been so disappointed. This movie is right up my alley: I'm studying so-called 'folded' films. A fine example is when you have a movie that has a play inside it and the reality of the two blur, like with 'French Lieutenant's Woman.'<br/><br/>This has another layer, the 'neverland' which folds into both. And the physics of neverland contain the mechanism for folding: 'just believe.' Somehow the producers knew that the material required folded actors. These are rare, possibly fewer than ten but include Kate and Johnny. I suppose the producer in question was Michael Dreyer who worked on a very similarly folded 'Iris,' also with Kate. They also made a very obvious choice: Dustin and Christie to represent the 'old' school of non-folding. Hoffman's character does nothing but shake his head over the lunacy of the project.<br/><br/>A built in advantage is that everyone knows 'Peter Pan.' And most filmgoers will know some of Depp's man-child characters. Some may even know Kate's first significant role (Juliet Hulme) was based on Wendy.<br/><br/>Starting with those astounding advantages, the writer and director proceed to turn fluid motion into mechanical clanking; movement into poses, emotion into cloying emotionalism. These actors must have hated it, as all the blending and folding became telegraphed shifts. This wasn't folded reality: it was quirky imagination.<br/><br/>Julio Medem would have made this into a lifealtering experience for all concerned instead of Oscar Wilde lite.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

A shallow unmemorable character for a shallow unmemorable movie. It's the Shakespeare in love formula applied to kids (minus gwynet and the good humor). It wont decide between the actual subject of the movie, either the creative process, the relationship with the kids or the relationship with the mother, IT could be considered as a whole but since obviously the director doesn't have the talent to touch all this points at once, the uncompromised movie fails to deliver almost every message it tries to get across.<br/><br/>Save your money, rent it if you'd like, don't keep feeding the greedy industry, rewarding it for bad movies with good PR executives."

","Today I viewed the premiere of Finding Neverland and found it most disappointing.Entertaining?Yes...but very factually incorrect. Johnny Depp was pleasant, but too young,too attractive and too tall....with no sign of the pipe.<br/><br/>Barrie didn't meet a young widow, but,after meeting her, and also her boys in the Gardens,became very friendly with Sylvia and Arthur Llewellyn Davies.This friendship lasted for the 10 years until Arthur finally succumbed to his facial cancer, and on his deathbed, Lleyellyn Davies made Barrie promise to look after his boys and wife for the rest of their days. The film showed J.M. and the family sharing his country cottage, but did not show the fact that the whole family took a nearby house for the season and lived separately. <br/><br/>In the movie, Sylvia basically said she was in love with Barrie and they both admitted they expected it to go on forever. It has been suggested that Barrie tampered with her will to get control of the boys. <br/><br/>Factually, both Arthur and Sylvia trusted Barrie with their boys, and rightly so, and wanted him to oversee their futures. Any suggestion of impure thoughts towards them are disgusting.<br/><br/>When his wife left him and they eventually divorced, he was distraught....and lost.<br/><br/>The film does rightly show Barrie's sense of fun and tremendous imagination, but it should be remembered, and shown,that he had deep sense of empathy with many characters and ""Peter Pan"" was the only play of his to survive the years to be completely written for the ""young at heart""."

","Finding Neverland is a semi-biographical film about the story focuses on Scottish writer J. M. Barrie, his platonic relationship with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, and his close friendship with her sons, who inspire the classic play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up.It stars Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet together with Radha Mitchell,Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman.The screenplay by David Magee is based on the play The Man Who Was Peter Pan by Allan Knee.It was directed by Marc Forster.<br/><br/>Following the dismal reception of his latest play, Little Mary, Barrie meets the widowed Sylvia and her four young sons in Kensington Gardens, and a strong friendship develops between them. He proves to be a great playmate and surrogate father figure for the boys, and their imaginative antics give him ideas which he incorporates into a play about boys who do not want to grow up, especially one named after troubled young Peter Llewelyn Davies. His wife Mary, who eventually divorces him, and Sylvia's mother Emma du Maurier, object to the amount of time Barrie spends with the Llewelyn Davies family. Emma also seeks to control her daughter and grandsons, especially as Sylvia becomes increasingly weak from an unidentified illness.Producer Charles Frohman skeptically agrees to mount Peter Pan despite his belief it holds no appeal for upper-class theatergoers. Barrie peppers the opening night audience with children from a nearby orphanage, and the adults present react to their infectious delight with an appreciation of their own. The play proves to be a huge success.Because Sylvia is too ill to attend the production, Barrie arranges to have an abridged production of it performed in her home. She dies shortly afterward, and Barrie finds that her will is to have him and her mother to look after the boys; an arrangement agreeable to both.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland is not exactly the way it happened, but this is a movie with a higher truth, one we need to believe in. And you will believe. You will.Like Big Fish and The Neverending Story, this is a film that reminds us that life, colored by our perceptions, is what we make it; all we have to do is believe.It won't pass muster for those looking for historical and Johnny Depp gives a graceful performance as Peter Pan creator J.M.

I could feel her sufferings, from one side she wholeheartedly enjoyed the fairy tale created by james, from the other, it's too good to be true, she was so afraid that she put all her hope on to a promise that was never made.At the end when James showed her the play, she smiled sincerely with tears in her eyes.Wonderful things do exist.

","Johnny Depp takes us by the hand and in the gentlest most reassuring way leads into the heart, soul and mind of an artist. How easy is for the world to judge. How frightened we still are of all we don't understand. The very nature of innocence is suspect because innocence belongs exclusively to the innocent. Every time the world claims to protect it, tends to destroy it. ""Finding Nerverland"" is filled with moments of enlightenment. Moving and powerful moments but none more so than Julie Christie's face as she applauds, converted to the fantasy transported into her daughter's house. The moment and the enlightenment are short lived, but, somehow, remains in my mind as a glimmer of hope. If for a moment she accepts the mystery of it all, maybe we all could. Johnny Depp is the best American actor of his generation, period. Kate Winslet is a stunning rarity among her contemporaries. She doesn't look like anybody else and the camera catches every tiny little thought that crosses her marvelous face. Congratulations Mr. Forster you can count on me from this moment on as a devoted fan."

But it should be(though I must say that I couldn't quote it).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives one of his best performances as James M.

I don't think i've heard a better Scottish accent before in my life. But thats not why his performance is so wonderful. Depp reaches into your hearts(and the characters) and tugs on your heart strings. Really, a wonderful performance.<br/><br/>The other performances are wonderful also. Kate Winslet(she can never let us down) gives a delightful performance also. And so does Freddie Highmore, who was Barrie's interest for his main character(you'll have to see it in order to find out what the story is).<br/><br/>The whole movie really tugs on your heart strings. And it also has a wide imagination, as you can tell by the scenes when Barrie and the kids are make believing. The movie shares their imagination, and its really wonderful.<br/><br/>I was so touched by the imagination and the final scene of it. Oh, the final, most beautiful scene of Finding Neverland.

","""if you find any little bit of happiness in the world, people try to crush it"", says James M. Barrie with a deep intensity. such is the stuff of Marc Forster's beautifully conceived and executed work of profoundly deep emotions, 'Finding Neverland'. it's a good old fashioned emotional tear jerker without being corny or mushy about anything. like Tim Burton's emotional and moving 'Big Fish', i still cry every time i see this. the fact that i've experienced the death of a close, loved one, makes this film feel very real and insightful.<br/><br/>as a long time fan of JMB, i can also appreciate how reverent and sensitive this is to his legendary children's masterpiece. sure there is some embellishment of history, and Johnny Depp's JMB is more dashing and charming then the real JMB who was somewhat stuffy and proper, but this film very effectively conveys the true essence and purpose of JMB's famous fairy world. 'Neverland' becomes a beautiful metaphor for the threshold of death. i'm not sure that's exactly what JMB meant to say, but Peter Pan always did say, ""to die would be an awfully big adventure"". except of course, in the Disney version which left that dialog out in order to ""disneyize"" the whole thing.<br/><br/>the understanding of Victorian/Edwardian England and it's prudish observance of conventionalities and mores of that time period is deeply insightful and basically historically accurate. in fact it's probably a more accurate depiction of England at that time then a hundred percent accurate telling of JMB's exploits. however, the accusation made about Barrie's interest in the children was very real and very unfortunate.<br/><br/>there is one very revealing moment about the stuffiness of the period when JMB and his wife retire to sleep. not only do they have separate beds, they have separate bedrooms. revealing of the period and the deterioration of their marriage.<br/><br/>the performances here are beyond reproach. it's hard to think of any recent film within the last decade where the performances are this good, this real, and this deeply felt. everyone in this is just so perfect. even though Depp is far too handsome to be JMB, he brings so much depth and refinement to this role you can't find him any fault. Kate Winslet is incredible here and equals Depp's performance with every frame and scene without overshadowing the importance of his performance. Winslet does the whole 'Dark Victory' bit without any trace of maudlin mawkishness. in fact, dying has never seemed so beautiful in film as her acting makes this. Julie Christie gives a performance worthy of more recognition then it received. and she should have won an Oscar for this. Freddie Highmore gives his usual first rate delivery. Highmore was definitely one of the best child actors of the decade. the always fascinating Toby Jones also does a delightful bit as 'Smee'.<br/><br/>the film direction and editing here are refined and perfect. Marc Forster aptly depicts the austerity of the time period as well as some beautifully conceived and brief fantasy flights. the flights of fantasy here are reminiscent of Peter Jackson's brilliant 'Heavenly Creatures', a film which also starred Winslet.<br/><br/>very few films have got away with the whole tear jerking emotionalism of the ""dying young"" drama. Julia Roberts couldn't pull it off. this kind of thing is usually botched and badly. that is why it is such a surprise that this film not only handles it's emotional sentimentalism well, it is great and effective cinema and wonderfully memorable entertainment."

","Johnny Depp is probably one of the most diverse actors of his generation. Just his name has become a brand of quality because when you see his name on a poster for a movie, you now it will be worth it. The same thing can be said about the always beautiful Kate Winslet but i don't need to mention many films to make you understand that she is one of the greatest actresses around. For example she was amazing in The Reader and Titanic but that's just the top of the iceberg. Finding Neverland is a very well done and mostly very carefully directed movie. This could be a mix of many things, we are talking about a package that includes; drama, comedy, interesting subjects and a truly amazing character study with a little doze of fantasy.<br/><br/>The story is fantastic, both beautiful and charming. The acting is brilliant but that is of course expected when you look at the main actors, Depp completely fits into his role and shows that he can easily be a serious actor and Winslet shines like always. Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman give us entertaining, maybe not playful performances. The technical side of it but specially the cinematography really pays of for this movie and it looks great. The best way to describe Finding Neverland is that it's a very confident film, something that the whole family could enjoy. It's lovely to see how the entertainment value flows through the whole movie and you never really feel bored. Only thing i can say bad about the films is how the ending is so cliché. I do realize that we are talking about a movie that is built on a true story but the drama just doesn't reach enough height to give us a more delicate ending.<br/><br/>8/10 - I completely recommend this film just because of Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet."
"taradiane","10","2","2","17 March 2010"," You're never too old to be a child.
","Finding Neverland (2004), a film by Marc Forster and starring Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, and Julie Christie is primarily a story about imagination. What author J.M. Barrie showed us when he first presented his story, Peter Pan, to a London audience in 1904 was that you're never too old to be a child. Finding Neverland is the story of just how much that belief meant to Barrie, and how he lived that belief, day to day, in good times and bad. It's the story of his struggles as a playwrite, his ultimately failing marriage, and most importantly, his friendship with Sylvia Llewellyn-Davies (wonderfully played by Kate Winslet) - including her four young boys and her overbearing mother (Julie Christie) in the aftermath of her husband's death.<br/><br/>We first meet Depp's Barrie in the opening scene of the film as the playwrite anxiously awaits the opening curtain for his new play. You instantly know from the way he nervously titters about backstage, spying on the audience to see who has arrived and their reactions to the first act that Barrie isn't the typical stiff-upper-lip Englishman (Scottish, actually, but everyone knows that London is where you make your name in theatre). Indeed, even his nervousness comes across as childlike, as do his ramblings to the stagehand when he tries to pry from him his reaction to what ends up being a disaster of a play – a play which the stagehand hasn't even seen.<br/><br/>When Barrie first meets the Davies boys in a park, there is a near instant bond with all but young Peter (in a stunning debut by Freddie Highmore of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fame). ""It's just a bit of silliness,"" Peter often says derisively about Barrie's antics, though he doesn't refrain from joining in his games with his other brothers. Barrie's subtle, understated attempts to show Peter that ""a bit of silliness"" is okay. There's a poignant scene in the film where Barrie gifts Peter with a leather-bound journal in which to write his own stories, and Peter seems at a loss as to what to do with it. ""Write about the talking whale,"" Barrie says to him. ""What whale?"" Peter asks, to which Barrie replies, ""The one that's trapped in your imagination and desperate to get out."" The tentative bond that eventually develops between Barrie and Peter, and separately between Barrie and Sylvia, is the heart of this film. While the lush scenery of London in the summertime, and the creative ways in which director Forster weaves fantasy in reality (brilliantly depicted in an early scene where the boys and Barrie are playing a game of cowboys and Indians in their back garden) are but backdrops (albeit seemingly integrated) to the ultimately bittersweet story of a newly formed family (Mr. Barrie eventually becomes Uncle Jim) – not through marriage or birth, but through friendship and affection, and the desire of one man to help a young boy remember that it is our imagination that keeps close to us the things we think are lost forever.<br/><br/>That Barrie has come into these boys lives while still grieving the loss of their father, and during a time that Barrie is struggling personally and professionally, seems to be one of those happy accidents that later proves to be a transformative moment in our lives. For Barrie, it is through young Peter that he finds the story that would go on to define Barrie for generations to come – that of Peter Pan, the boy who never grew up, Depp, Winslet, and director Marc Forster take a story that could have been an overly-saccharine disaster, and brought it to life in the same way that Barrie brought Peter and Wendy to life for the Llewellyn-Davies family, sharing the same time-tested truth that there is a child in all of us no matter how old we get."

Johnny Depp uses his magical powers as a chameleon to transform himself into the Scottish storyteller of the 1800s. ""Finding Neverland"" takes the viewer into the personal lives of the relationships that Berrie used to create the magical story of a boy who refused to grow up. These relationships although not acceptable for the time, would none the less survive and flourish as the widow Sylvia and her 4 sons, Michael, Peter, Jack and George, become enamored with the boyish playful nature of Barrie. This story shows that the hardships of life can have devastating effects on children, to the point where it can rob them of their childhood. When Barrie first meets the Llewelyn Davies family the young son Peter has become old beyond his years due to the loss of his father to cancer. Barrie uses his fascinating imagination and creativity to bring the children back to a more innocent happy time in their lives. After meeting Sylvia and her sons Barrie is faced with the lifeless marriage that has developed over the years within his own life. Barrie develops a deep love for Sylvia and her boys and is determined to lead the family to the peaceful place in his imagination ""Neverland."" ""Finding Neverland"" was reminiscent of the 1990 TV Movie, ""The Dreamer of OZ"" which chronicled the life of the famous author L. Frank Baum who created ""The Wizard of OZ."" Both stories gave the viewing audience a perspective on the power of imagination for these two gifted storytellers. Throughout the filming of ""Finding Neverland"" the cinematography was exceptional. Clear, crisp, colorful, on location filming was done to perfection. Scenes out of the imagination of Barrie were so bright and focused to the magic of his mind that the audience is taken right to the heart of ""Neverland"". I felt an immediate admiration for both the writer and the man Sir James Matthew Barrie."

Even the child actors, particularly Freddie Highmore, are convincingly authentic.<br/><br/>The directorial style is accomplished, with Marc Forster quietly adding to a resume of diverse and challenging films.

While I normally can't stand screenwriters 'improving' history this film is not an egregious offender since the script is mostly devoid of cliché. One of the most interesting questions that the characters are confronted with is how to maintain innocence in the face of life's trials and tribulations. This is not a meaningless Hollywood fluff piece, it is a film that attempts to provoke thought while it entertains.<br/><br/>If you're looking for historical accuracy, look elsewhere.

In-depth look at James Barrie is moving and accurate, bringing him back to life with a youthful, charming Johnny Depp. The study of the writer makes his person interesting in the process and never looses the conductive string.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with emotional tones and scenes, some too over the top, but the most of them clearly focused. For the ones that are sensible on movie watching, load yourself on tissues. The movie reveals a world which was relentless, conspicuous, close minded. The character of Barrie is a delight and one will fall in love with this child in a grown up body.<br/><br/>The art direction revives the Victorian era, with great architectural designs and a beautiful matrix of wardrobes and clothing. The story is emotional and passionate top notch.<br/><br/>Don't believe in fairy tales, it's fine. But release your inner child and see this movie, this poem. A great movie that accomplished its goals. A delight."

","Finding Neverland totally surprised me. Considering the Hollywood flicks that we are used to see, even in the fantasy genre, this movie represents the best of both worlds, following the life of Sir James Barry, the author of peter pan and how he was influenced and inspired by a family, is portrayed in the finest manners. <br/><br/>With star cast involving Jonny Depp, who is brilliant in adapting so many biographical roles, truly one of the most versatile artists in the industry, being the roughish yet charming jack sparrow and being the elegant and gentle James Barry in Finding Neverland , alongside Kate Winslet which i believe was an excellent choice, having a British accent and notable innocence one her face, she intensifies the drama and their on screen chemistry shines even with out a single kiss or love scene, Director Marc Forster's great direction makes this movie a treat for all ages. But truly along side screen greats as Depp and Kate Winslet the young star Freddie Highmore looks a promising actor of this business. The supporting cast of Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman is also very well executed and one never forgets their short but yet great performances on the screen.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to to every person who is creative in his nature or wants to be. this is not just a fantastic film but also makes the viewer ponder upon the idea of what he or she can get out of simple but lovable relationships and how we can be touched by the lives of people around us and how it effects our own perspective of life.<br/><br/>My advice do watch it, take your kids along with you and see the magic of fantasy in a way that has not been told for a long time on the film screen."

","I've never been a big fan of Johnny Depp and I never fell into the ""Pirates..."" saga, but he pulls one out of the hat in this world of make believe that comes to life with just a hint of imagination.<br/><br/>Depp plays J M Barrie, the author of ""Peter Pan."" After a flop on his last play, he stumbles upon a woman and her children in the park, where he strikes up a friendship with them (under the un-approving eye of society) and forms a bond with the children, thus basing the book on the many adventures he takes with the children.<br/><br/>A little bit of knowledge of the lore of the book is a must, otherwise you'll never understand what's going on. Even I, myself, have never realized the connections the book had with real life, such as the crocodile chasing Captain Hook while harboring a ticking clock in his stomach, signifying how time catches up with all of us.<br/><br/>A touching movie and one I don't think I'll be able to top for a long time.

","My strong liking for ""Finding Neverland"" is very strange, being that I despise every other film on Mark Froster's resume. However, this is a great film and Forster's usually annoying sincerity and sentimentality is the perfect touch for this film. Johnny Depp shows what a great actor he really is when he takes off all the makeup and quirky mannerisms to pull off a phenomenal performance as Mr. J. M. Barrie. His acting, which in this film is restrained on the surface but powerful within, takes away the possible dullness of the film. The story itself moves along at a rather slow pace, but is charming and enjoyable the entire time. It is driven by stand-out performances by the above-mentioned star as well as Dustin Hoffman and the lovely Kate Winslet. If not already nominated for ""Eternal Sunshine,"" Winslet would surely have received an Oscar nod for this film. The other show-stealer in the movie is actually the young Freddie Highmore. Having not yet received all the fame and offers he did after ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" Highmore acts without any of the arrogance or pretentiousness that we have now become accustomed to seeing him with. The story itself, which is mostly true, is saddening, but at the same time breath-taking and deeply emotional. It's a tear-jerker to the highest degree, and is a great film for men and women of all ages. See it for the fascinating story and the stellar performances."

"thomas-tammy","10","2","2","7 January 2006"," A beautiful film
","For years, ""Peter Pan"" has been iconic, the lost boys, the never aging Pan,untouchable, whimsical and tinged by sadness without knowing how he came to be, but finally we were allowed to glimpse the soul of his creator,J.M. Barrie, masterfully played by Johnny Depp. The ever so soft Scottish accent was perfectly rendered , not blustery or over the top with all of the rough rolling of the rrrrrrrrrrrrr's and glottal stops that many performers affect while using imitating the language, but Mr. Depp delivers a believable Scottish 'burr"" that gives the appearance of having been softened from years in the world of the English upper crust. Mr.Depp's performance was warm, inviting and thoroughly convincing as a man of kindness and compassion but also possessing the child-like wonder of the world around him. His co star, Freddie Highmore, provides the inspiration for Peter Pan to Depp's Barrie, however, one comes away from the film feeling as if a true and lasting friendship has been made off screen for the two. I highly recommend this movie, it is one of the infrequent treasures of cinema that one can take every member of the family to see and yet have each member come away happy and thoroughly enchanted by the film.

","What can I say...is there a word I can use to describe this movie after the end credits are coming on screen...yes there is.WONDERFUL is that word.In a nutshell Finding Neverland shows the audience how the Peter Pan story was created. This movie showed me and anyone that knows anything about acting that Johnny Depp must get an Academy Award for Best Actor sooner or later. Sooner would be better. This movie was wonderfully written and directed from start to finish. Kate Winslet did an excellent job. Johnny Depp, as usual, was superb. He just becomes his character no matter who it may be. Believe it or not though..it wasn't Johnny Depp's acting that I was talking about after the movie(well...a little)but instead it was a young actor that I was seeing for the first time by the name of Freddie Highmore. He appeared very comfortable in the role. He was just as enjoyable to watch as Mr.Depp. Excellent work young Freddie Highmore.<br/><br/>If you want to sit down one evening and watch a nice family movie with good acting and story telling...don't bypass Finding Neverland. By the way...if you're a sentimental person...be prepared for the last two/three scenes. Touching is an understatement.Have the tissues ready. I can see a lot of ladies crying during these scenes. Wonderful last scene with Johnny Depp & Freddie Highmore. WONDERFUL!!!"

I was in tears near the end of the movie and not just because of the death, but because of the wonderful idea. The movie seemed to create a real world and when I saw it I was in awe of Johnny Depp's acting abilities. He is a wonderful actor and I love him and the character he plays in the movie. The movie shows a side of a person which you don't see in real life and not often in movies. He maintained the character throughout the movie, but made sure it stayed with the plot. The movie was very sad, and if I could give only one movie in the world a 10 out of 10, it would most definitely be this one.

"Buddy-51","8","2","2","17 November 2005"," strong performances
","Johnny Depp gives one of his most subtle performances to date in ""Finding Neverland,"" a film about the creative process that has a thing or two to say about the part imagination plays in all our lives. In this adaptation of the play by Allan Knee, Depp plays J.M. Barrie, the author who, in 1904, introduced the world to Peter Pan. According to the movie (though not necessarily reality), Barrie gleaned the inspiration for his creation from a beautiful young widow and her four sons whom he met one day in the park and with whom he forged a deep and lasting relationship (there are a few factual errors in that synopsis, but in the interest of keeping your confusion to a minimum, I'll recount the story as the movie presents it). In his endeavors to entertain the children, Barrie brought them into his world of magical make believe, eventually weaving the story of Peter Pan out of those experiences.<br/><br/>When we first meet Barrie, he is already a well-known and successful playwright in the London theater world - although his latest work has bored his audience and critics so thoroughly in its premiere performance that it is forced to close on opening night. Suffering from creative stagnation and stuck in a stifling marriage, Barrie eventually finds surcease and an outlet for his creativity with his new-found ""family"" from the park. However, even though the film technically takes place in the Edwardian Era, the iron hand of Victorian Era morality still holds England firmly in its icy grip. For soon rumors are flying not only about the ""unseemly"" relationship between Barrie and Mrs. Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, but even about the questionable and potentially sinister nature of Barrie's relationship with the boys.<br/><br/>Written by David Magee and directed by Marc Foster, ""Finding Neverland"" offers a touching, fascinating glimpse into the mind of a man in the process of creating one of the most enduring tales of modern literature. One of the marks of any ""classic"" work of inspiration - be it art, music, literature or drama - is that we are never aware of the nuts-and-bolts process that has gone into its creation. The greater the work, the more we are inclined to believe that it dropped fully formed from heaven, a rare gift from the gods that seems somehow always to have existed somewhere. That is certainly the case with ""Peter Pan,"" which is why ""Finding Neverland"" provides such an invaluable service. It forces us to acknowledge that even the greatest of creations, which we tend to attribute to that mysterious and intangible entity known as ""genius,"" are really the product of one part inspiration to two parts fortuitous timing and hard work. ""Finding Neverland"" flows effortlessly between the events as they happened in real life and the fantasy scenarios that Barrie eventually wove out of them to create his masterpiece. As a result, the movie itself has a kind of heightened fairy tale feel to it that works well in the context of the story. The movie also affords us an entertaining behind-the-scenes view of the creation of the play itself and a breathless recreation of its opening night.<br/><br/>In addition to Depp, the film is filled with fine performances by Kate Winslet as Sylvia, Julie Christie as her stern, disapproving mother, Dustin Hoffman as Barrie's sympathetic theater manager, and Radha Mitchell, as Barrie's cold, status-conscious wife. The four young actors who play the boys are also excellent, with Freddie Highmore, as the precocious and too-cynical-for-his-own-good Peter, a particular standout.<br/><br/>Historians may find room to quibble about some of the liberties the film takes with the facts. Sylvia was not a widow at the time of the story and her husband resented the intrusion of Barrie into their lives. Even one of the sons has been dropped. This is acceptable, however, since an over-cluttered plot would likely have robbed the film of the simplicity it needs to sustain its fairy tale ambiance. Moreover, the movie telescopes a number of key events to enhance their dramatic impact (i.e. his wife's affair with writer Gilbert Cannan, which is shown as being a contemporaneous event, actually occurred a number of years after this part of the story). But such nitpicking seems fruitless in the overall scheme of the film.<br/><br/>Was Peter Llewelyn Davies the real inspiration for Peter Pan or was it J.M. Barrie himself? The film doesn't answer that question, but it certainly hints at the distinct possibility of the latter. For Barrie was clearly a man who much preferred the warm fantasies of carefree childhood to the cold cynicism of responsible adulthood. And that, of course, has always been the heart and soul - as well as the life's blood - of his own paean to eternal youth, ""Peter Pan."""

","It takes a lot for a film to make me cry, and this one did! Finding Neverland is film that is very rare in today's main stream cinema. Although it has a couple of special effects shots the story is primary. When I first saw the film I had brought a cast of 50 from a production of Peter Pan I was co-directing. When asked to clap if we believed in fairies the whole cinema did. The film is so simple but powerful and to me this is the true magic of film. For two hours we are allowed to escape from the fast moving modern world of today and relax in a place were the inner child can smile. The cast all give excellent performances and the film's direction is great. We all know the story of Peter Pan but watching this film you will discover how rare and truly inspirational it is. I would recommend this film to anyone because it deals with the people we once were and want to be again. Finding Neverland is a must have for every family collection."

I actually expected to be a silly little Peter Pan movie Johnny Depp was doing for his son and daughter. Therefore, at the end when Kate Winslet's character died I was completely shocked. I did not expect it and I was soon overcome by tears. It was, however, a very good movie for people of all ages. By the end of the movie I did not even care that Johnny Depp was in it. This movie has a great story line, cast, and I absolutely adored the setting. It was such a great time in history. Everything was so much simpler back in that time period. Overall an absolutely great movie made better by the fact that it is a true story."

I had never seen Johnny Depp in anything before that. Shortly after that publicity about Johnny Depp caused me to ""write him off"", I decided I did not want to support his behavior by paying to watch his work. In May of this year (2005) I went to Blockbuster to pick up a movie. I chose ""Finding Neverland"" based solely on the case picture.

It does help that it was Depp playing Barrie.<br/><br/>I have yet to find an actor who can add that element of whimsical mystique, as can also be seen in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, so characteristic of Depp. Not mention the elegance that only Kate Winslet can bring to the screen would doing the movie injustice.

"marntfield","9","2","2","23 July 2005"," A Moving Period Piece
","I just saw this film for the first time last night and was quite pleasantly surprised. Overwhelmingly so in fact. Knowing a little bit about the true history of Sir J.M. Barrie and yet comparatively little about ""Finding Neverland"" other than its Oscar hoopla, I expected the film to focus largely on the often controversial life of a man deemed capricious, anomic, and asexual by many historians, with the inception of Peter Pan as a backdrop perhaps. Instead the film celebrates Barrie's brilliant vision of what would become a timeless tale and cultural staple for the ages, and the power of imagination that we all possess and, if willing, are able to unleash. It celebrates the whimsical, the eccentric, and the ""silliness"" which make life, even in the stilted atmosphere of Victorian London, worth living. The film is both an artistic period piece and a rich character study (though not a biography), and features some of the best and most convincing performances from child actors in recent memory. Depp is brilliant as usual and Dustin Hoffman as his tightly wound producer/financier also makes for one of the more enjoyable, though secondary, characters to watch. The film starts somewhat slowly but seamlessly evolves into an engrossing and emotionally engaging story which unlike many other critically acclaimed dramas wrought of style over substance, is unquestionably worthy of its high praise. It has both the substance, as well as a style all its own, and should make even the most jaded and cynical viewer well up a little bit. 9/10"

The acting is fantastic by adults and children alike and the story is, without a doubt, fantastic and adventurous. J.M. Barrie (Depp), playwright, has written a play.

He develops a friendly relationship with the boys and their mother and is what inspires him to write the great play called Peter Pan, the story of a boy who never wanted to grow up.

I definitely would recommend this movie for all movie-goers out there who want a movie about simply believing."

","this one loving film to watch. johnny Depp is superb as always and his accent is brilliant and sexy. Winslet and Depp together are a great team especially with newcomer Freddie Highmore. the film is about how J.M Barrie develops his famous story of peter pan. the film is heart warming and very emotional if you have not seen this film you must see it family fun.WHEN I FIRST Wtched the film i fell in love with it Forester is a superb director and has made a wonderful job of it. johnny Depp is great and i am a huge fan i think this film has shown his true quality and potential of his acting. Winslet is absolutely fantastic as Sylvia and i found her as a lovely character who just wanted to make everything lovely for her children which is great as it shows her in a similar light to that of her own character."

","Absolutely wonderful. I've always loved Johnny Depp but now i think i really love him=) Its an excellent, wonderful and very see-worthy movie. Highly recommended. I can watch it over and over again and i will never get bored of it. It had it all: romance, laugh, a good cry etc. It is absolutely the best movie that have been done in a very very long time. If you like Johnny Depp you will love it even if drama isn't anything for you in normal cases. If you like drama you are going to watch it over and over again and never get sick of it. It is extremely good, thats all i need to say. It is a very well-done movie and the actors are perfect for their characters. If you don't like either Depp or dramas you will find this movie very boring and i don't think you should watch it in the case. Enjoy"

","Finding Neverland, finding the interior of a genius' head, his endless imagination, in the certain knowledge that keeping ourselves away from the adult world is what give us life and joy; finding a bear under the skin of a good-natured dog, finding the far-west in the garden of any given house of Victorian London; finding how an universal piece of art is developed.<br/><br/>Finding that Johnny Depp knows how to be a great big actor, that he knows how to be sober and how he controls a different accent. Finding a little big man called Freddie Highmore, one of those children with an ancient look and an innate talent for performing (just like his female counterpart, Dakota Flanning). Finding a soundtrack and an editing that will drive you to the verge of crying.<br/><br/>Finding what we already knew: Kate Winslet is one of the best, and Julie Christie or Dustin Hoffman have grew old in the wisest possible way. Finding that every day that goes by there are less Peter Pans left and that Captain Hook and his crew have won the battle. So if you want to be moved, if you want to laugh, if you want fantasy, if you want to feel like a child again and forget about the f***ing real world, just go and find Neverland.

","This film was the reason I subscribed to IMDb, I used the site a lot, but never posted, this film changed it all! The moving story along with a great cast made me want to write a moving report. After a while the only thing I can say is, this movie moved me to tears. The only thing I can add is, watch this movie! You won't regret it! Now comes the hard part, if I want you to read this I have to fill enough lines with text so as to get it posted. The performance of the never aging Johnny Depp was inspiring to say the least and Kate Winslet didn't spoil it for me, forgive me for my slightly biased opinion. The kids were great and the ever imposing Julie Christie made an impression in her few camera moments. The journey into the unknown or forgotten memories of our childhood fantasies seen acted out by an adult made me want to go back to my childhood or make me the wacko uncle, forgive the word choice, kids deserve. This movie doesn't only tells a beautiful tale but also gives us an insight in who we should be. AAAAaaahh don't listen to me, just watch it and form your own opinion, I guess you will like it a lot and maybe learn from it. Have Fun"
"worstpirateever","9","2","2","13 May 2005"," One of Johhny Depp's Finest Performances
","Finding Neverland is a fine film with excellent acting and a grand performance by Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean) who easily adapts himself to this type of role. The film delivers a great plot and a great script and the film continues to prosper the whole way through thanks to the excellent directing by Marc Forster. Johnny Depp engages the audience throughout the whole film and the character he plays is a kind, warm-hearted man. Kate Winslet also delivers fine acting, showing off her skills that she also used in films such as Titanic. Freddie Highmore (also be working with Depp in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), young at age, also delivers great acting through the film with the rest of the children. The film shows a range of relationships and difficulties in life, with compelling scenes, Johnny Depp persuades the audience that sometimes you need to sacrifice some relationships for others. This film exceeds my expectations and definitely is worth seeing. This is one Johnny Depp's finest performances and also paves way for the acting life of Freddie Highmore. I recommend the movie for the whole family, but be warned, it may make you cry."
"dfranzen70","9","2","2","12 May 2005"," Perfect!
","Finding Neverland is the story of how struggling playwright J. M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) created Peter Pan, inspired by an equally struggling widow (Kate Winslet) and her four rambunctious boys. Exquisitely detailed, with sumptuous and elaborate set pieces, Marc Forster's filming of the Allan Knee play is artful without being arty.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Barrie, although there's the usual caveat that Johnny Depp is perfectly cast in almost anything. He might well be the best actor working today, especially since he refuses to let himself become typecast. Hard to believe now that he used to be on that old Fox TV show, isn't it? Depp is dead-on earnest as the wise, soulful Barrie, who becomes a sort-of surrogate father to the four Davies boys, whose father has since passed away (although in real life he hadn't yet died when Barrie met the family).<br/><br/>Although the movie is about the creation of Peter Pan, at its heart are smaller dovetailing storythreads about relationships, particularly those between Barrie and his wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell), Barrie and Sylvia Davies (Winslet), and Barrie and the youngest Davies boy, Peter (Freddie Highmore). Depp's mastery of expression and pathos are on display here, as he turns in an utterly commanding, pitch-perfect performance; his Oscar nomination for this role was well deserved indeed.<br/><br/>Depp is supported by an excellent cast that looks like it's been performing the roles for years. In particular, Winslet and Mitchell were magnificent, as was the venerable Julie Christie, who plays Sylvia's mother Mrs. Emma du Maurier. Dustin Hoffman turns in decent work as Charles Frohman, the proprietor of the playhouse in which Barrie's plays were performed (in other words, his patron). As Depp is now, Hoffman was long known for being able to disappear into a role - his roles in the 1970s alone are mighty eclectic indeed.<br/><br/>This is a sheer beauty to behold, a movie that should certainly stand the test of time to be regarded in a few decades as a true classic. Your jaw will drop at some of the set pieces on display - check out the pirate ship! - and you'll marvel at the jaunty forays into the imagination of the playwright who never grew up. Finding Neverland will have even the most jaded and heartless melting and shimmering with pure, unadulterated joy."

","Before viewing this film, I happened to see the 1924 silent Peter Pan. This made my viewing of this film an even richer experience & if you have not seen either, would strongly recommend seeing both, the silent first & then the sound. Walt Disney did a brilliant animated version of Peter Pan in the 1950's, but I feel the silent film relates & gives more meaning to seeing this film.<br/><br/>This Neverland film is brilliant. Johnny Depp shines again in another outstanding performance. Kate Winslet, Julie Christie, & Dustin Hoffman are fantastic support. This film is touching & has a strong heart that beats through the drama. Dramatic films as well done as this are too rare today.<br/><br/>This film shows how the human imagination can rise beyond even what an animator can put on film. It creates a perfect stage to show where human imagination can go. Just imagine an artist in front of you with a blank canvas opening up their imagination, creative process, to you as the viewer, and then filling that canvas in. I never believed this process could be done on a movie film, until now."

","Winslet keeps getting better with age, and of course Johnny Depp is his usual, top-notch best. British actress Julie Christie plays the seemingly evil 'Captain Hook' grandmother, Mrs. Du Maurier, who tries to prevent a social scandal among the upper-crust Londoner set; Johnny Depp's character, J.M. Barrie, ingratiates himself on a widow (Du Maurier's daughter) and her four children. <br/><br/>The scandal involves the fact that Barrie is already married, and that--from Victorian society's perspective--the close relationship that develops between Barrie and the young boys is... suspicious, to say the least. But there is no such ulterior motives afoot: Barrie develops a healthy, platonic bond with Mrs. Davies and her children... and innocence and love reign supreme. <br/><br/>Obviously, the widow Mrs. Davies (played by Winslet) is the inspiration (or corollary) for the 'Wendy' character in Barrie's play/novel ""Peter Pan,"" but this is just my personal hunch. The viewer of this tear-jerking gem will have to do the research for him- or herself. Finally, it is not surprising to know that this film was nominated for several Academy Awards."

","Finding Neverland is VERY good movie. It is WONDERFUL Story telling. We laughed. We cried. The cinematography was beautiful, the costuming and casting was great. Generally speaking, kids can be difficult in dramas, but young Peter plays his role very well. Nick Roud plays the eldest Davies son powerfully. Depp and Winslet are a wonderful team together and play off one another great. Depp is funny, sentimental and debonair. Winslet is a perfect matriarch for four precocious sons. Superbly acted and an amazing adaptation to Big Screen for this play. A beautiful, piece of writing with some very sentimental moments about growing up sons. Beautiful all the way around."

Prior to seeing the movie, I questioned how well they would be able to make us envision Neverland. To my surprise, and gratitude, I remembered being a child, with flashes of Christmas' and Halloween's past, as I watched the story grow from Mr. Barrie's experiences, to his Neverland. Kudos also to Mr. Freddie Highmore, the young man that played the role of Peter. Had there been any lesser acting by either Mr. Depp or Ms. Winslet, surely he would have carried the movie.

"benihana83","9","2","2","19 April 2005"," Touching story and performances..
","The master of the perfect accent, Johnny Depp, leaped onto the big screen again this year in the immensely successful Finding Neverland. While the film's title may lead some to poke fun, with the Michael Jackson trial in full swing, this movie is nothing to laugh at. It is a touching look at the life of J.M. Barrie, the playwright behind the legendary Peter Pan.<br/><br/>The film follows Barrie as he struggles to complete the story and production of Peter Pan. Along the way, he meets up with a widowed mother (Kate Winslet) and her young sons. Barrie helps one of the boys, an introverted youngster played by Freddie Highmore, discover his joy for writing and life. Through the boys, Barrie finds the inspiration for his next play. Through Barrie, the boys re-discover the father figure they lost years ago.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland tugs at all strings. At any time it can be funny, touching, poignant or agonizing. The goal of the story is to pull at your emotions and the film succeeds in every way. While all aspects of this movie were very successful, it's the performances by the actors that put it over the top.<br/><br/>Depp earned - and I do mean earned - yet another best actor Academy Award nomination for his performance as J.M. Barrie. Despite the fact that he was nominated last year for his role in Pirates of the Caribbean, the committee had no choice but to give him his second straight nod. After being snubbed by the Academy for several roles in the 1990s, including Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and especially Donnie Brasco, he's finally getting his just desserts as an actor.<br/><br/>Winslet also turns in a heart-wrenching performance as Sylvia Davies, an ill-stricken, single mother of four. Pair this role with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Winslet managed to turn in a year of performances in 2004 that most actresses would love to have in a lifetime.<br/><br/>In addition to Depp and Winslet, 12-year-old Freddie Highmore burst onto the screen in Finding Neverland as perhaps the next great child actor. In fact, Highmore was so good playing one of Davies' four sons that acclaimed director Tim Burton decided to cast him alongside Depp again this summer. He is set to play Charlie Bucket in a new version of Roald Dahl's children's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, due out in July."

","I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters around Thanksgiving. I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and figured the movie would have cute storyline. A friend and I were home from college for Thanksgiving break and had not seen each other since we both left for school the past fall. This movie was incredible. It really is the perfect ""all-around"" masterpiece. It made me laugh, cry, get angry, be frustrated, and hopeful. It has been a long while since a movie was able to create such a wide-range of emotions. Over the past few years I have been very disappointed in the movies Hollywood has been putting out. They all seem to be going for the big epic to try and grab an Oscar. This movie got back to basics and I felt like I truly connected with all the characters. The best part of this movie was how my friend and I felt after seeing it. We had both just started college and were so stressed with school and money and moving and starting new friendships, that we were having trouble remembering what's important. In the words of Mr. Barry, we were ""growing up"". This movie took us back to our childhood. It allowed us to remember what it was like to play in the backyard with our siblings, act out imaginary stories as we played ""dress-up"", laugh at silly, perhaps ridiculous things, and see the magic in everything as we did when we were kids. This movie reminds us that family and friends is so important in life. And that you should not take life too seriously because if you do, you will suffer the worst fate in the world: losing the ability to have fun and find joy in almost every situation. This movie is great for all ages, but I highly recommend it to those of you who have forgotten what it is like to loose yourself in your imagination. Those of you who may be ""growing up"", or already have grown up. ""Finding Neverland"" has the ability to bring you back to your child hood."

The colors and pictures presented were lovely, and when Barrie presents his play especially for Mrs. Llewellyn Davies... so very touching. The boys were excellent, and Highmore was a joy to watch. He never over acted and was completely believable the whole time. Considering the movie is nothing more than dialogue and imagination, it does a wonderful job of keeping your attention. Everything is so eloquently stated that you can't help but become enthralled. It makes me want to go grab my copy of Peter Pan and read for the rest of the evening. Just a beautiful movie."
"helen-kerslake","8","2","2","31 March 2005"," Heart-warming escape from reality
","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, as even though it turned out to be entirely different from what the title suggested to me, it was an amazing story of fantasy blended with a degree of reality. The movie is based around the idea that a brilliant man, Sir James Barrie played by Johnny Depp, brought his failing career as a playwright back to life with a children's play inspired by a family he meets by chance one day in the park. The beginning drags a little as everything seems cheery and there is no conflict at all, but luckily Depp's acting is so great that he holds the interest of the audience until the story moves onto more exciting events and revelations.<br/><br/>I was slightly disappointed in the way that many of the characters had been written and can only assume that the stereotypical traits they displayed were incorporated so that young children could more easily follow the story without being distracted by complex characters. However, this assumption goes against the fact that 'Finding Neverland' is a fairytale for grownups. The issues it deals with are more suited to a mature audience: dealing with heartbreak and loss, the notion of 'growing up' and being expected to shoulder responsibility rather than enjoy a carefree life, as well as the idea that the mind is a powerful tool and imagination limited only to each individual.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp stands out as the star of the show, and was the perfect choice for the role of a grown man who remains a passionate child at heart. I was also very impressed with the final 'production' of Peter Pan within the movie. The sets were astonishing and really made you believe that what you were seeing was real, in a way similar to the effect created by earlier scenes where we saw through the eyes of the main character. I have high praise for the young girl who played the role of Peter Pan within the play, as her belief in what she was saying came through convincingly without the overdone acting so common with inexperienced actors/actresses.<br/><br/>Overall this film was charming with the innocence of a childlike mind and I found myself in tears during the final few scenes as my emotions, which had been subtly manipulated over the course of the film, rose to such a level that I felt pain as if I were one of the characters in the story myself."

Out of all the possible nominees, THIS IS THE FILM that SHOULD HAVE taken BEST PICTURE and each of them should have taken home best actor/best actress. Would love to see this pair teamed up for future such INTELLIGENT endeavors in film. This is a far more intelligent, substantial, and ultimately MOVING film (more worthy of Winslet & Depps capacities) than either of the glossy plastic Hollywood productions of Titanic or Pirates of The Caribbean. Additional acknowledgment should be given to Freddie Highmore(the child who played Peter)who proves to be unbelievably affective/shockingly beyond his years and may just prove to be one of the best actors of the next generation.

","I was in another country for some time and hadn't had the pleasure of seeing many of the Oscar nominated films this past year. Watching this film I laughed, cried and torn through several mixtures of the two. So I can only imagine politics played a behind the scenes part of why this powerful and well scripted and photographed film fell short on the big night. I applaud the winners and fellow nominees but still remain disappointed this gem was lost among all else. Whatever the reason, the Academy missed how it was beautifully brought to life, of course by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, but also Freddie Highmore. This actor is as talented as he is young, definitely someone to watch for in the upcoming Willy Wonka also with Depp. Neverland had all the right parts for a great story, but sometimes it takes the child within to look past the adult business of success."

It has all aspects in it that we people please. All kinds of emotions we like. We like to laugh, it's good to cry, we like drama we like childhood, it's all in there and more. It is one of those movies that don't really exist anymore these days. It's not a movie with sex for once, it is not a commercial movie. It has love in it though. This movie is so pure and innocent; it touches the soul! And above all, I think it is inspiring. It shows that we are all children still, and in this society people want to grow up so soon, and they think using fantasy is childish. Well my opinion is that using your fantasy is a fantastic thing. It makes you happy when you are sad, it makes you laugh when you feel like you want to cry. I believe that people who use there fantasy more are happier people. And those kind of people can achieve more, because they are more open for other ideas, and they can see things from different (unrealistic) point of views.<br/><br/>To make a long story short; Finding Neverland is an inspiration for young and old.

"FilmOtaku","7","2","2","23 February 2005"," Okay, I'll admit it  I got sucked in
","Never having been a fan of ""Peter Pan"" and therefore ambivalent to J.M. Barrie himself, I wasn't in a big hurry to see ""Finding Neverland"" despite the many accolades it received. However, since it showed up on the IMDb Top 250 list and as a Best Picture nominee I figured I'd better check it out.<br/><br/>To my surprise, I found the film to be extremely beautiful and charming. ""Finding Neverland"" chronicles the creation of Barrie's play ""Peter Pan"" and its profound effect on the lives of the people in Barrie's life as well as theatergoers in England. Barrie, (Depp) a mediocre playwright who is not able to reach his audience and is therefore beginning to bankrupt his faithful producer Charles Frohman (Hoffman), is writing one day in the park when he happens upon the Llewelyn Davies family. Sylvia (Winslet), the mother (and a young widow) is trying to corral her four young boys and when they run into Barrie they immediately become friends. Barrie begins to spend increasingly more time with the family, much to the chagrin of his wife Mary and Sylvia's mother Emma (Christie). It becomes clear that the Barries' marriage has been slowly falling apart for some time now, but because of their time apart and his obvious adoration of the Llewelyn Davies family, the deterioration becomes more rapid. Emma, on the other hand, is the typical overbearing mother who disapproves of Barrie, mainly because he is ruining Sylvia's chances of ""landing"" another man. When a crisis strikes the Llewelyn Davies family, Barrie grows closer to Peter, the second youngest son, who is still grieving the loss of his own father, and the loss of his imagination; something that Barrie tries to help him through.<br/><br/>The only other Marc Forster film I had seen prior to ""Finding Neverland"" was ""Monsters Ball"", a film that I really didn't like, but more for its actors and story than for the production of the film. I was therefore intrigued by what his treatment of this film, a completely different subject matter, would be. I found this film completely and utterly aesthetically beautiful. Even before the ""Peter Pan"" and Neverland scenes, I was struck by the gorgeous Victorian sets and costumes, and the interesting way that Barrie's imagination was expressed. (Opening up his bedroom door and seemingly walking into a green meadow is just one of the many examples) The Neverland scenes were simply stunning, so much so that they were profoundly emotional. I particularly loved a scene when ""Peter Pan"" was premiering, and orphans that had been invited by Barrie to watch the performance experienced it for the first time  I can't stand children, but the looks on their faces and the reactions of the aristocratic members of the audience to the children was so very touching. There were things about the film that I did not care for regarding the film of course; without giving a lot away, I thought that there were a few moments of easy resolution (particularly involving Barrie and his wife) and I think that the relationship that Barrie had with Sylvia was a bit TOO subtle, because when he discloses his feelings for her I remember thinking, ""Oh. Really?"" Obviously there was great affection, but not to the extent that was realized. I also noticed that the alleged pedophilia was obviously not addressed; something that I expected but was hoping wouldn't be glossed over.<br/><br/>I've come to expect top-notch performances by Johnny Depp at this point, and he absolutely did not disappoint in his portrayal of Barrie. He was utterly charming, and without the use of makeup or Tim Burton, really became somebody else that was not recognizable as ""Johnny Depp playing (fill in the blank)"". I'm not a huge fan of Winslet, though I do recognize her acting ability, and I thought she was very good in this film. Certain actresses do period pieces well, and she is definitely one of them. She was entirely believable as the mother of the boys and exuded warmth and protectiveness, yet showed that she is still young and can horse around with her sons and Barrie because she enjoys it.<br/><br/>I was kind of expecting that I would feel this film took the place of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" as a Best Picture nominee, but after experiencing the film I feel it is very deserving of its nomination. Those who know me will probably be shocked that I enjoyed this film so much because I normally have no interest in cute sentimentality (and furthermore, children) in film, but because Forster created such a beautiful film, I have to give it a solid 7/10.<br/><br/>--Shelly"
"gurl_48","9","2","2","31 January 2005"," Very touching, another superb performance from Depp and well worth the wait
","I had been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I first saw the trailer. Anything with Johnny Depp instantly appeals to me (for obvious reasons, ask any girl and she'll probably melt at the sound of his name). So when I entered the theatre to see it I really wasn't expecting much else except to drool at Mr Depp. Of course, I was pleasantly surprised to find a touching and warm film before me.<br/><br/>The film begins with J.M. Barrie realizing his play is terrible. The problems between him and his wife are shown clearly as they sleep in separate rooms. Barrie meets the Davies boys and their mother Sylvia in Kensington Parks and is immediately fond of them. The boys lost their father and Sylvia is a widow who has no income. Barrie crows increasingly close to the boys despite gossip and rumours circulating about his intentions with Mrs Davies as well as the boys. Sylvia's mother disapproves greatly of Barrie's interest with the family. Through the experiences he shares with the Davies, he gains inspiration for his next play, naming the lead character Peter Pan after one of the Davies boys whom he has become closest to. Sylvia falls ill and it becomes obvious that her illness is serious. However, she doesn't want to admit it and simply wants life to continue as normal.<br/><br/>Depp rose to the occasion magnificently, sporting a perfect Scottish accent and portraying the real boy who never wanted to grow up very effectively. We can see why he feels the way he does, his mother's neglect of him and his eagerness to please her after the loss of his brother. He sees himself so vividly in the Davies boys, especially Peter. Freddie Highmore gives an amazing performance that will break anyone's heart. The scene when he destroys the set of his own play when he realizes that his mother is sick is so heart wrenching you can't help but get sucked into this world. All the actors give great performances, Winslet is the warm and kind mother who will do anything for her boys, Christie as the domineering grandmother and Mitchell as Barrie's wife who has given up hope are all realistic and give wonderful performances. Hoffman adds some humour but I thought was rather unused and could have had a larger part perhaps.<br/><br/>The film is expertly put together. The plot may seem slightly predictable but when you are actually watching the film, it never occurs to you that you could easily figure out what is going to happen.<br/><br/>Overall, a very touching and moving film which I enjoyed thoroughly and definitely deserves its Oscar nominations, though I highly doubt it shall win anything."
"marypoppins145","10","2","2","30 January 2005"," Brilliant!
","This film and it's childlike elements touched me deeply. As a lover of Peter Pan and Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, I was blown away by this film. The performances of the young boys, particularly Peter and John were very well acted for such young children. Kate and Johnny's interaction on screen is spectacular. The so-called ""polite affections"" as they were called in The New York Times, were what made the movie for me. The music conveyed a sense of childhood, yet an acceptance of responsibility and adulthood on the part of all the boys. This film, though almost certain to move you to tears will leave you feeling more complete as a person. As the other reviewer said- this film is most certainly not just for children."

","I just came back from seeing this movie in high spirits. It was one of those rare movies which manages to be both funny and touching at the same time (""Man on the Moon"" comes to mind as another example). The movie is quite straightforward and does not break new ground in any way. But the story is good and uplifting (I wonder how much is actually true), the direction is good if not brilliant, and the acting is overall outstanding. I have had some reservations about Johnny Depp before, but here he is perfect. And the little boy who plays Peter; what can I say, the final scene just blew me away. I laughed out loud and was moved to tears several times during this film. Recommended!"

","I don't think i've seen many movies like this one - enjoyable from start to finish. Beautiful and understated performances by all - particularly Depp - just the right amount of humour and timely surreal splices of fantasy. i can't believe being a 33yr old male that i get sucked into the emotion of these films but, when you see this stuff on your own there's no one there to maintain the Stiff Upper Lip so mine just wobbled (a little). It's nice to see that the tearjerker scenes were also understated and i liked the way Sylvia wandered into the garden (to her Neverland) as her *final* walk - this could have been sooo much more sentimental. Let's hope this thing gets some recognition in the coming months."

","It isn't very often that a movie makes you think about how much you are smiling during it. But that is exactly what this movie will do. The movie is about the author of the beloved story Peter Pan, but it is so much more than that. This movie is about believing. This is the type of movie that makes you want to go into the world and make it better somehow. A moving tale that has complex situations but will bring the viewers mind back to the simplicity of being a child. The simplicity of the knowledge that anything can be real if you just believe in it. This is a movie that dives into the mind of a creative genius as he searches for a way to reveal the world that he sees through a play. It is a movie that deals with relationships and what can happen if you open your heart up to people. It is a movie that will make you laugh and cry, but most importantly, it will make you smile.

Winslet, Mitchel and Hoffman are also awesome, and make this movie a magnificent work of art. This movie is definitely one of the best movies of 2004. The story is powerful, believable and touching.

","OK, this film is about the guy who wrote ""Peter Pan"", and what led him to write it (just for one review, I don't want to be accused of including spoilers). Much of what has already been written, particularly the comment by the divorce attorney and the 'Trivia' section, is worth reading. So what can I say that hasn't already been said? How about: boys in Britain really did dress like that once; Johnny Depp's Scottish accent is nearly realistic but not quite right; and despite being about Neverland, it's one of the most realistic portrayals of humanity to come out of Hollywood for some time. If you liked it, particularly the boys, you might also like ""Hope and Glory"" from 1987 -- less of a tear jerker, but another good angle on British childhood in difficult circumstances."

"I_have_a_brain_cloud","8","2","2","25 January 2005"," Fantasia on the Life of James M. Barrie
","I love this movie. I really do. I've seen it multiple times and will try to see it again before it leaves theaters. But it needs a different title: it should be called ""Finding Neverland: A Fantasia Loosely Based on the Life of James Barrie."" It is not the life of James Barrie, nor the life of those four (five) boys and their mother. Most of the factual errors of the script have already been pointed out in these comments, but I'll reiterate those that to me seem most egregious: Barrie was an interloper in the family, never really accepted, a surrogate father only in his own mind (heart); much of his acceptance by the family was based on his pocketbook; Sylvia did NOT name him as guardian after her death. His relationship with Sylvia and Arthur's family was always uneasythe movie locates the source of this stress solely in Sylvia's mother (the Julie Christie character), but unfairly. There is no evidence that Mary was a frigid social-climber. Barrie was emotionally damaged himself but (probably) harmless. He was small and peculiar-looking. Of the five Llewelyn-Davies boys, one died at 19 in a suspicious drowning accident at Oxford (suspicious because it might have been a suicide--I believe this was Michael, Barrie's favorite); one was killed in World War I; Peter committed suicide in 1960.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp as James Barrie is Barrie as we might have liked to see him, the Barrie we might wish for in our own dreams, no more real than Peter Pan. This movie also gives those boys the childhood we might like to see--and the promise for them of long, non-tragic, and creative lives. <br/><br/>But it is a pleasure to see the fantasy, and as a fantasy, it is a great movie."

","Johnny Depp is finally starting to get the recognition he has long deserved. After his film debut in 1984's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', Depp worked 19 years to get his first Oscar nomination for 'Pirates of the Caribbean' in 2003. His other roles in 'Benny and Joon' 'Ed Wood' and 'Donnie Brasco' are all Oscar worthy but he was never recognized. In 'Finding Neverland', Depp plays J.M. Barrie, creator of the Peter Pan legend. The film innocently tells of the inspiration for his literary creation of miracle and wonder. Kate Winslet plays the mother in a family of boys from whom Barrie draws his inspiration after courting her and becoming a father figure to the young men. Julie Christie plays the boys' grandmother who disapproves of Barrie's relationship with the boys. This film is told with Victorian style and a tender pace of emotional tranquility."

","I thought Finding Neverland was very good overall. Yes, it is one of this year's best, and Johnny Depp continues to be one of my favorite actors. It was charming and well acted, but I was not overwhelmingly impressed. The strength of this film is the enchanting telling of a story based on ""true"" events. The novelty lies in the interweaving of the real life story with the fantasy story of ""Peter Pan"", and since it is a fictional story about the development of a fictional story, I just did not find it that brilliant or innovative in the many references to the well known children's story. It kind of reminded me of the film formula of ""Shakespeare in Love"" (about the behind the scenes development of Romeo and Juliet) or the lesser known ""Dreamchild"" (about the development of Alice in Wonderland) or even ""Santa Clause The Movie"" (about the whole Santa mythos). It was well acted, particularly by Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, and the kid that played ""Peter"", his performance alone might elicit tears. Probably because of Kate Winslet and the late Victorian costuming, I was reminded of one of those Merchant/Ivory E.M. Forster English parlour dramas which seems to lend it a more sophisticated art-house ambiance. I would recommend it, but I think it would be just as enjoyable at home on DVD. Also, would I need to see it over and over (the true test of a future classic)? .....honestly, no."

","This movie was very moving and emotional, a serious tear-jerker. The acting was excellent, especially in the children, and of course Johnny Depp was stunning. (and gorgeous.) One of my personal favorite aspects of the movie was that when J.M Barrie was telling stories to the children you saw exactly what he imagined, say if they were on a small raft on a lake he imagined it as a pirate ship in the ocean, and you saw that. Small touches like these were scattered throughout the movie and it made it all the more real and fantastic to watch. Very enjoyable and humorous at times, with a sweet, if sad ending. Its sort of 'Chocolat' mixed with a little costume drama, and a sprinkling of Titanic romance. The soundtrack was also beautiful. a must see, and a personal fave."

"abum190","8","2","2","3 January 2005"," The best movie I've seen all year
","Granted, I haven't seen all of the critically heralded films of 2004, but I believe this would stay my favorite no matter how good the others turn out to be. The magic and wonder of this story captured me from the very first moment that Barrie meets the boys and gives them his dancing bear show.<br/><br/>J.M. Barrie (real-life author of Peter Pan (please tell me you've heard of it) played by Johnny Depp in the film) is a playwright whose last play was not up to his usual snuff, most likely due to his lack of inspiration from his life with his wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell). Seeking solitude and ideas, Barrie goes for a walk in the park where me meets Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (a widow, Kate Winslet) and her children, a meeting that sparks many more meetings and imaginative games that inspire the story of Peter Pan.<br/><br/>The cinematography is spectacular. Director Marc Forster makes excellent choices with the camera that seem to play along with the screenplay and the score. These three elements work together quite well and turn a simple story into a masterpiece. There are a few times when I felt I was being rushed through certain parts, but the movie makes up for it with it's incredible cast.<br/><br/>After seeing Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean, I was shocked to see how well he can underplay a character. Depp gives an already poignant character and even more strikingly poignant manner with every inflection, movement, and look. Kate Winslet is equally touching, and while she does not have as much to do as Depp, she matches his talent with brilliant skill of her own. Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman give good turns as Sylvia's mother and the producer of Barrie's play, respectively.<br/><br/>I think the player that the critics have sinfully underrated is Radha Mitchell. I barely read any praise for her wonderful job as Barrie's wife in any review when she deserves just as much as Depp or Winslet.<br/><br/>This is a moving story that everyone should be subjected to, no matter what age or mindset. Man, I loved this movie."

","First off, I have to state my one complaint...*sorry* I'm a little disappointed that this film didn't contain a little more fantasy. Maybe I expected something a little more like Big Fish, or maybe I relied on the trailers more than I should have. Anyway, I thought the movie was fantastic...The art, the story, the transitions between reality and fantasy, and the acting. I was extremely surprised at the children's acting abilities, and I thought that the boy who played Peter was wonderful. Depp's accent was a surprise at first, but I got used to it and actually began to enjoy it. The art was wonderful, and the pirate ship scene was amazing. As for the transitions, I felt that they were very well done, especially when Barrie (Depp) was questioning the boys about becoming pirates. I do feel that the ending was a little too centered around tear-jerking, but that was just the situation, wasn't it? I would strongly suggest seeing this movie :)"

","First of all I want to say that Winslet an Depp are 2 of the best actors of their generation. <br/><br/>I find Finding Neverland a touching story. Depp convinces as Barry (nice accent) and all other actors are well known and show their best. Nothing wrong with the acting. The story is emotional, but not too emotional or too smooth. The magical elements that come in when Barry takes the children into his imaginary world is beautiful and well balanced. Nothing wrong with that. <br/><br/>And that is maybe also a little criticism about the film. It doesn't bother itself with deeper things, like rumours about Barry's pedophilia, however mentioned briefly. There could have been a nice opportunity to make this film more special.

","With no prior knowledge other than speculation of Oscar nominations did I watch Finding Neverland. It's the films that surprise you that are the true classics and gems and this one will forever be one for me.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland is the story of Peter Pan creator James Barrie. A brilliant playwright, an imaginative, playful man who is surrounded by the adult world and feels rather held back until he meets a widow with four very interesting young children. One of the middle children Peter is quite devastated by the death of his father and lashes out against the world of children. Barrie introduces laughter and fun and above all else amazing imagination into the Children's lives and their mother. Despite all others around him trying to repress his imaginative spirit he uses the children as inspiration to create the amazing world of Peter Pan.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp who I am an enormous fan of is brilliant as Barrie. He encompasses the character perfectly and shows us a man who just wants to have fun and show others how to imagine and have fun as well. Kate Winslet, who I have always saw as an extreme over actor is actually very good, her best role in fact as the mother and widow of the children. Depp and Winslet's character share a deep friendship, and an understanding and love but are never romantic together. Depp's character is married and although unhappy he works to try and make his wife understand him. Dustin Hoffman who also is one of my all time favorite actors, (Captain Hook himself) makes a cameo appearance as Barrie's financier for his plays. He doesn't really have faith in this carefree spirited Peter Pan play but he allows Barrie to have his way and the rest is history.<br/><br/>The film is moving, and interesting, and captivating. The characters are brilliant and the story is just amazing. The cast is perfect and everyone does an amazing job. It truly is a wonderful story. But in addition to all that the film is also very unique and pushes your imagination to the limit with beautiful imaginary scenery and bazaar moments when everything changes around them as they create their Neverland. You must see this film, it's one of the best I have seen in a very long time. I do believe this film will always be one of my favorites and I can't think of a thing wrong with it and therefore must give it a hearty 10/10. I loved it."
"DaveinFtLauderdale","10","2","2","22 December 2004"," Movie worthy of a different era.
","One word can be used to sum up ""Finding Neverland""- Brilliant! My wife and I are longtime fans of Turner Classic Movies and find the cinema of says 1940 to about 1970 superior to what you have today. Special effects, with the actors supporting them, seems to be the rule rather than the exception! Character development, script and skill full direction, are often lacking in the movies of today. Here we have an achievement worthy of the Academy's consideration. Forster's directing is wonderful, he weaves a powerful story full of emotion, imagination, thought and feelings, with great skill and tenderness. The principles take their characters to mean something we can identify with. The children are all excellent, particularly the young boy who plays Peter. His screen chemistry with Depp is remarkable. A word about Mr. Depp. In my view, he has ascended to the level of THE great actor of this generation. He can stand eye to eye with Gregory Peck, Lawrence Olivier, Clark Gable, Paul Newman- all of the GREAT actors of yesteryear, and be right at home. Other than the obvious theme in the movie's second half, the rating could be ""G""."
"shattenjager777","10","2","2","15 December 2004"," My best picture of the year
","This film is formulaic, predictable, and even downright sappy at many points. But it's fantastic.<br/><br/>A playwright who has the imagination of a child befriends a group of children and their *SPOILER* dying *SPOILER OVER* single mother and they inspire him to create his greatest play. It's almost exactly what one would expect from a film about the creator of Peter Pan--a film about the power and importance of imagination and loaded with fun. However, as opposed to the famous Pan, this work clearly sets out to show that there are boundaries to the use of the imagination. This film also turns out to be, despite or perhaps even partly because of the fun, heart-wrenching. I have never seen so sad a movie in my life.<br/><br/>The acting is what saves this from being a silly, sappy little movie, really, headed of course by the always-brilliant Kate Winslet, the overrated-but-excellent Johnny Depp, and the always-brilliant Dustin Hoffman. Depp plays his character with a surprisingly subtlety and understatement, hitting every note perfectly. Kate Winslet and Dustin Hoffman don't have much to work with, but the charisma of each makes the character far more interesting than either deserves to be. In a supporting role, Julie Christie also (again expectedly) performs excellently and makes her character more than she should have been (And hasn't she gotten an awful lot of work since retiring a decade ago?); so that while watching the film, one feels surrounded by fascinating characters who, upon further study, aren't so interesting--just wonderfully acted. The surprise of the movie was probably in the performance of Freddie Highmore, who gave one of the best child performances I have ever seen (right with Anton Yelchin in ""Hearts in Atlantis"" and Emma Watson in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"").<br/><br/>That said, the acting is not all this film has to offer. The direction by Marc Forster surpassed the excellent direction of his previous film, ""Monster's Ball,"" which is no small feat, and made for an interesting watch, with his constant employment of visual trickery. He gives us some odd angles, some special effects where we don't expect them, and a number of other effects that hold the viewer's attention wonderfully, which may be necessary considering the somewhat flimsy story and overused themes.<br/><br/>In all, ""Finding Neverland"" is a fantastic emotional movie led by amazing acting and wonderful direction. Under close scrutiny, it almost comes across as a fraud, but with the emotional punch it packs, it doesn't need to provide any intellectual satisfaction to make a fantastic film.<br/><br/>I would also like to point out that, although I've heard people around town talking about it as though it's a somewhat dark portrait of a possible pedophile--it's not. Kids may even enjoy the film, because it's got a bit of a Disney feel to it and much of the interaction between the children and Barrie is very fun, so don't fear the film. I don't know how widespread this talk is, but I wouldn't want anyone to miss out on such a wonderful viewing experience due to misinformation."

","I've never been a big Depp fan... I still think ""21 jump street"" and shudder. I was pleasantly thrilled , therefore, to see him in a commanding performance as Sir James Matthew Barrie in the movie. It is by far his best feat of acting and quite possibly will earn him a nomination. The direction of the film was well played out and had no loss of continuity. Also it was quite artfully done. The soundtrack enhanced and did not overpower the scenes as is common in many modern films.<br/><br/>My only complaints about the film were the lack of subplots that were vastly hinted at. A more involved level of conflict between Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie) and James would have been welcomed and lent some depth to all of the characters involved. The resolution of the film seemed a bit hastily done after the gentle expanding of the plot up to that point. One wonders if the deleted scenes that will be present on the DVD will add more flavor to the film... in fact I wonder if the deleted scenes or any subplots were actually planned by the filmmakers in advance... to further DVD sales.<br/><br/>A must see in the theatre.

"movito72","9","2","2","19 December 2004"," Johnny Depp turns in another wondrous, heartfelt performance
","Johnny Depp shines in this wonderful, clean, and fun family film about the man who created ""Peter Pan"" and the real-life boys who inspired him. That man's name was J.M. Barrie, a Scottish playwright living in turn-of the-century London and trapped in a loveless marriage to failed actress Mary (Radha Mitchell). One day, while in the park writing down his thoughts in a notebook, he meets the lively Davies family, consisting of a mother (Kate Winslet), and her four boys. The one that affects Barrie the most is Peter (Freddie Highmore, soon to be Charlie in Tim Burton's remake of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) because he sees his own younger self in the boy. He teaches the boys to use their imaginations and because of their free-spirited, youthful adventures Barrie begins to think of a new play, the one that will make him famous: ""Peter Pan."" <br/><br/>Johnny Depp brings a sense of grace and fun to his role, in a very non-showy performance that somehow still manages to be the center of the film. He is almost overrun by young Highmore, who at the film's conclusion delivers the most piercing scene in the film with Depp. One of the shots, when he gazes straight at the camera as a tear slowly rolls down his cheek, would make anyone ashamed of growing up and betraying their own inner Peter Pan. Dustin Hoffman provides outstanding support as Barrie's grumbling but kind producer and Julie Christie as Mrs. Davies' overbearing mother, who provides Barrie's inspiration for the villainous Captain Hook. And as Mrs. Davies, Kate Winslet shows once again how fine of an actress she is, stepping back into her normal British accent after playing an American in this year's earlier ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" with Jim Carrey.<br/><br/>Director Marc Forster (""Monster's Ball"") uses subtle techniques and themes throughout the film without trying to be too artsy. He just lets the actors do their work and infuses the scenes of Barrie's imagination with a youthful splendor that helps infuse the movie with an emotional tenderness that is no longer seen in today's films. There is barely anything offensive in this film. Forster uses no clichés except a tear-jerking conclusion, but it works so well, and the actors never make it too melodramatic. Because of its heartfelt acting and scenes infused with the wonders of the imagination, ""Finding Neverland"" proves to be a magical ride for the whole family, with Johnny Depp showing his chameleon-like acting abilities yet again in a flawless Scottish accent and carefree attitude. It's an uplifting, joyous film, and I recommend it to anyone who longs to relive the grand innocence of youth."

","I have never been disappointed with a Depp movie, and all the performances in this film add to the the rich texture of the film. My criteria for a film I would recommend to others are that it provide characters that you care about, and that the performances be believable. This movie does that and more. There are wonderful costumes, a good story (romanticized a bit perhaps), and the mood created carried me along without confusing me or going overboard.The young man who plays the part of Peter does a beautiful job, equal to Anna Paquin's performance in The Piano. This is my favorite movie of 2004. Hard to say much more without getting too deep into the story or revealing things that are best viewed without too much information."

","WOWWWWWWWWWWW This movie was great! It's a series of intrinsic events revolving around a playwright, Mr. Barrie, and his inspiration from four young boys to compose the well-known and highly popular play-turned-movie, Peter Pan. This movie follows Mr. Barrie as he grasps little details from his everyday life and adventures to the country with the boys and their recently-widowed mother to create such a wonderful masterpiece. As he experiences difficulties from his estranged spouse and his demeaning financier, he turns to his journal in hopes of composing a wonderful piece of literature. This movie is highly recommended for those who grew up a little too fast in life. If this is the one movie you see all year, it will have been worth it!"
"justjudy75","10","2","2","18 December 2004"," Giving ""Finding Neverland"" a 10
","Once again a Johnny Depp movie has sent me to the internet for research. He has hit the mark in his character portrayal of Barrie. The research shows. Depp's quiet unassuming manner never upstaging for the sake of upstaging. Actively engaging the other players. Each nuance delivered with ease and purpose. Each projected mental picture in the development of the Peter Pan story was a delightful process to watch. The setting and dress brought to light that which I only pictured in my mind.....the way I suppose it REALLY was....not typically Hollywood gussied up! The whole cast moved easily through the time period. Never seeming out of place. Perfect casting.<br/><br/>My only disappointment was that our theater said it was not getting the movie. Guess word got around how good it was and protests went out. We are having a limited engagement! Glad I didn't miss it and was told about it through the grapevine.<br/><br/>I could roll the credits here and say.....""each and every one of you did a job worthy of honors upon honors, awards upon awards"". Job well done!!! This movie only proves, once again, that a good movie doesn't need foul mouthed language, hot bedroom scenes, shoot 'em or blow 'em up to tell a story with meat. A good story at that! An enduring story. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"MeanMrPepper","10","2","2","18 December 2004"," A rare film of beauty. *Many spoilers*
","Finding Neverland is easily one of the best pictures of recent years, and certainly the best of its type.<br/><br/>The movie's greatest achievement is that it either forgoes the standard clichés or uses them very subtly. First is the humour. Films of this type often go overboard, but not this one, it doesn't go for cheap (Or cute) humour. It does have humorous parts, but they are few and it did not put them in at the expense of the plot.<br/><br/>It also is above going for cheap emotions, it earns its sadness and it's happiness, it doesn't go for cheap manufactured Hallmark card sadness or cotton-candy happiness.<br/><br/>At one point it dawns on Barrie to invite 25 children, mostly orphans, to the opening of his play. On the outside this seems like something from Patch Adams, but the movie ignores the standard clichés, and this doesn't seem manufactured.<br/><br/>Another cliché they ignored was the standard ""You're not my father."" Scene which is inevitable in any movie with children without a father. While pretending to be Indians, Barrie does call Peter his son, and Peter does stop pretending and he does tell Barrie, ""You're not my father."" And run off, but that's the only time you see it. The film never brings it up again because it's quite clear Barrie doesn't want to be the children's father.<br/><br/>Child actors are usually hit or miss, but the children in this film were excellent. There are times in which the boy who plays Peter even outshines Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>During a play Peter wrote for his mother and Barrie, the mother goes into a fit of coughing and the doctor has to be called, Peter runs outside and starts demolishing the set. Barrie tells the boy that his mother claims that it's only a chest cold and that she'll be okay. But Peter went through this with his father already and tells Berrie, ""I will not be a made a fool of!"" He then recounts how is mother told him his father was going to take the family fishing in a few weeks, and how his father then died the very next night.<br/><br/>The film manages to seamlessly integrate reality and fantasy. When Barrie and the children play, it switches back and forth between reality and fantasy, one moment the children are standing against a tree and Barrie is dressed as a pirate, the next they are tied to a ship on the sea and he's cutting them loose in exchange for them agreeing to be pirates. This manages to be more believable than Robin Williams filling a tank with spaghetti, because they don't ask you to suspend your disbelief, they tell you that it's just make-believe.<br/><br/>But the movie is anything but a fantasy, it's most likely the most realistic of its kind because it gives you a realistic ending, not manufactured, and not something you see in major movies anymore.<br/><br/>The saddest scene comes when the mother is close to dying, she tells Berrie that she would once like him to take her to Neverland, so the next time he sees her when she is very sick, he brings the actors from his play to the house and they recreate the play in the house. The walls open up and Neverland is revealed, people are flying, there is Captain Hook, the alligator, mermaids, fairies. The mother walks out into Neverland in a flowing gown. It's an incredibly sad scene, but it's also happy. My first thought was that this was the ending, and even though it was unrealistic, I would have had no problems with it ending right there. But it isn't the ending, the movie flashes forward to the mother's funeral. Peter runs off, Barrie follows, he finds Peter sitting on a bench, they talk about his mother. Barrie tells him that his mother isn't gone if he believes he's there. You see Barrie and Peter together on the bench, and they start to fade transparent. The ending was one of the most beautiful I've seen, no happy ending, no sad ending, just an ending, a perfect ending, an ending that you rarely in mainstream modern films."

","I loved this movie. Johnny Depp was a wonderful J.M. Barrie. If his performance hadn't been so genuine and heartfelt, he'd be receiving lots of kudos for his mastery of the Scottish accent -- but a real emotional performance always overshadows technical skill. Kate Winslet was also fantastic, as Barrie's platonic friend and mother to four orphaned boys.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell and Julie Christie has less to do in fairly one-dimensional roles, but both are able to surprise you in their respective final scenes of the picture.<br/><br/>But it's the final-final scene that will slay you. Without ""giving it away,"" I'll simply say this: If you don't cry at the end of this movie, you're not human. Either that, or you've had your tear ducts surgically removed.<br/><br/>I was immovable during the final scene of ""Finding Neverland,"" rendered helpless and unable to get up from my seat until I had composed myself after the final credits had finished rolling.<br/><br/>Definitely see this film.

"jlarmstr","10","2","2","18 December 2004"," Power Acting, Powerful Film
","Probably one of the year's best, but first the acting. Johnny Depp is one of those diamonds in the rough. Starting with a small, supporting part in Nightmare on Elm Street (where I first saw him) to 21 Jump Street, I would not have considered him anything more than another entertainer on screen. Tom Hanks, similarly from Splash to Busom Buddies to Bachelor party, who would have thought. Depp has matured into his own, so much so that within this genre of actors he will be grouped into sames like Hanks, Crowe, Brody etc as we group actors like Gable, Bogart, Peck and Stewart. (He absolutely carried Pirates of the Caribbean BTW). Next comes Winslet, who also is proving herself from Titanic, to Heavenly Creatures, to this.... not to mention Julie Christie (Dr. Zhivago)....If you are simply a fan of the art of acting and wish to see an ensemble cast of great performances, intertwining seamlessly to pull together a beautiful story then you will find no finer example than Finding Neverland.<br/><br/>Next, the film, inspired by a true story, we well adapted (though liberties taken). Superbly written and powerfully directed, I cannot exit this comment without giving anyone a strong encouragement to GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Oddly, it came out in limited release, a shame, it should play in EVERY theater around the world. It reminds you what it was like to be a kid again......"

","I wouldn't dare presume to tell people what they are and are not going to like. I'm going to instead describe what I like. I love the imagination in this film. I love it that Johnny Depp is acting like the 40-year-old he is, and I think he's matured beautifully as an actor. As someone who doesn't speak with a British accent, he nonetheless had me convinced he was Irish or Scottish or whatever he was supposed to be. Compared to Jodie Foster's trying to be British in the otherwise wonderful ""The King and I"", Mr. Depp was fabulous. I loved the Tim Burtonish touches in this film that reminded me so much of another wonderful movie, ""Big Fish"". And the children. What wonderful children, especially young Freddie. As the trivia section suggests, the screenwriter took some artistic license with the truth; but since when has the truth gotten in the way of a good story? I have no idea what the criteria are for Oscar films; but I wouldn't be surprised if this were a contender, even though I want ""Ray"" to win."

This film was probably the best I've seen all year. I went into the film expecting it to be wonderful, and the film definitely delivered. Kate Winslet put on an absolutely glowing performance, and her personal search for Neverland was intertwined beautifully with the coming of age for four little boys growing up far too fast. Particularly touching was the innocence of Johnny Depp's character, who through all suspicion and criticism, held onto his beliefs and stayed strong in his purpose, and changed the lives of an entire family, and perhaps an entire world.<br/><br/>A must see, a beautiful movie, and I definitely cried through the entire end. =) Go see it!"

While I did have some problems with Johnny Depp's accent in the film, it bothered me less and less as it went on, because it wasn't as distracting as other accent fouls.

","This is by far the best movie I have seen this year! It has been a long, long time since I have been to a movie theatre where the audience broke into genuine spontaneous applause at the end of the movie! With just a hint of the POTC's ""Captain Jack"", in some scenes, Depp gives a masterful performance as J.M. Barrie, the creator of ""Peter Pan"". Once again Depp is superb in a demanding role. This guy has to be the best and most versatile actor in Hollywood today! The supporting cast is excellent too. Hoffman as Barrie's gruff but faithful and patient backer and producer, Mitchell as an increasingly frustrated wife and Winslet as a devoted and tragic mother-figure. As for Julie Christie, all that I can say about her is that, like the old cliché of ""a fine wine"", she just gets better and better with age! Although I would like to have seen more of her character in this movie, I think there is a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Ms. Christie for her work here. The screenplay is superb as is the film work. No blood, guts, foul language or over excesses of special effects here! Just a beautifully scripted and acted movie with a great cast and excellent direction. As usual, Hollywood takes some liberties with the script, but what Marc Foster does so well is show us how Barrie got his inspiration for Peter Pan while only hinting at the possible darker side of Barrie's life. In real life Barrie's world did not imitate Hollywood (it unfortunately seldom does!). However, the storyline is so good and well written that you won't care! Just remember to bring a few extra handkerchiefs for the final scenes. A wonderful movie full of drama, tragedy and the triumph of the human spirit! This movie is surely a lock for an Oscar nomination. As for ""JD"", if he does not get an Oscar win never mind a nomination for this movie, then the folks who cast their votes at the Academy should be promptly sent to ""Neverland"" themselves for a ""wake up call!"

","While recuperating from a critical and audience drumming of his latest writing effort, J.M.Barrie finds solace and inspiration from a local widow and her 4 young sons. One of which goes by the name of Peter.<br/><br/>Despite being born and growing up in Germany, Director Marc Forster seems equally comfortable in victorian London as he did in the deep south of 'Monsters Ball'. By these 2 films alone he doesn't seem to have to much more to prove to anybody. <br/><br/>Finding Neverland is a beautiful and engaging film from start to finish in the finest tradition of sumptuous storytelling. Funny, dramatic and heart wrenching in equal measure, it never once drops the ball. Jonny Depp is excellent in the lead role of J.M.Barrie (creator of Peter Pan). His family friend and father like affection for the 4 boys is impossible to dislike and never once leans towards suspicious, despite the accusations of other characters, especially the boys Grandmother, another commanding performance from Julie Christie. Kate Winslet puts in another perfect English Rose as the Widowed mother of 4, and cold is the heart that isn't moved by her plight. <br/><br/>Part of the reason this film stands apart from the usual, true story, period piece, is in its continual flirtations between reality and fantasy when Depp is entertaining the children. Jumping between the real and imagined several times in a single scene you'll fondly remember how, with a little imagination your back garden could be anywhere you wanted it to be. It also serves as a beautiful way with which we see Barrie slowly creating the world and characters for his most famous creation. <br/><br/>Finding Neverland deserves all the praise and accolades it may or may not receive. Direction, script, acting and cinematography are all first class. Go on, treat yourself. Search for Neverland and you too will find yourself clapping saying ""I believe in fairy's"". <br/><br/>One warning, don't be mislead by the Peter Pan back story, while I wouldn't advise against little children seeing it (There's certainly nothing they shouldn't see). This is a family drama and children under 10 may get a little bored."

","Though I went to the movie with some reservations, I was totally enthralled by the performance of Johnny Depp in the role of James Barrie. The simplicity of his motivation combined with the deeply complex portrayal were riveting. The movie covers Barrie's disintegrating relationship with his wife, the innuendo as to the nature of his relationship with a widow and her children and the possibilities in everyday life. I couldn't talk my eyes of the film and was alternately laughing and in tears with the poignancy of the relationships portrayed. Definitely a must see and I certainly will be going to see it again. It was probably a bonus( at least for me)to see the film without children in the audience as I went to a showing while our local Santa Claus Parade was taking place.

","Okay, so I may be a little biased here because when I was a kid, Disney's Peter Pan was my favourite thing in the world, but bear with me. Finding Neverland is a truly wonderful film that is touching, uplifting, moving, happy and sad. Johnny Depp plays Barrie exceptionally well, eccentric and excitable but all the while still restrained enough to be convincing of the time period. His attempt on the Scotting accent was admirable, not perfect, at times he sounded a little too like Shrek, but on the whole better than I could have done, and I have Scottish heritage!<br/><br/>Kate Winslet also makes a fine turn, but the real gems of this movie are the children. The young boy playing Peter was exceptional, he really convinced me of the trauma he was going through and I found it heart wrenching that this sweet little boy with a wonderful imagination was having to grow up and deal with the pains of the adult world. <br/><br/>Finding Neverland revolves around themes that are all present in Peter Pan, the escapism, the power of belief, the importance of friendship and adventure but most of all the theme of not wanting to grow up. Finding Neverland doesn't really add much that hasn;t already been said about Peter Pan, but what it does do is tell the story of its genesis beautifully. It re-inforces the Peter Pan message of enjoying childhood and that within us all we are all children at heart. It shows that even though J M Barrie had the best and honourable intentions, his actions also caused sadness and grief to those he loved. The film shows his dilemma and the pain this caused him, but also how he need and will to delight the world with wonder and magic drove him to do the things he did. J M Barrie may have upset some people and had personal heartache along the way, but his gift to the millions of people who have enjoyed and loved Peter Pan is a testament to the man's vision. I think this film is a fine reflection of Mr Barrie, his inspiration and the legacy that he has left behind. <br/><br/>A wonderful and touching film. 8/10."

","Johnny Depp continues his excellence in acting by making each role different and believable. But its a newcomer playing the role of young Peter that reels you in without mercy. It's an remarkable cast, a well written story, and a wonderful evening at the movies. Take a tissue box for the rewarding sentimentalism, but know that you will leave convinced there is a Neverland. Because it is so identifiable, the story of Peter Pan is easy to blend and jog the memory of every viewer until they are drawn in yet again to the Peter Pan story and all its nuances. But the subtle weaving of the play and the real life story together, involve the viewer slowly into the climax as the play itself is unveiled, and the movie theater audience is as drawn in as the screen audience they are watching. Watch for this not only at Oscar time, but also as a video favorite through the years."

All of the actors were outstanding but Depp was exceptional and I have to say he definitely deserves to win the Oscar for his performance at next years Oscars after missing out this year. He put on a Scottish accent to play the role of Barrie, which was flawless. The little boy in the film who played Peter was remarkable, he showed real emotion and I think we will be seeing a lot more of him in years to come. The film should definitely be labeled a tearjerker as this is exactly what it is. The last twenty minutes of viewing left the audience with more emotion than a week of Eastenders does.

Kate Winslet is also back on form with a tour de force performance of great emotional depth. But for me, the real honours go to Freddie Highmore, who plays Peter. Forget Hayley Joel Osment from Sixth Sense, Highmore gives such a moving performance that he is definitely one to watch for the future. I can't wait to see him as Charlie in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The last scene with Highmore and Depp on the park bench will stay with me for a long, long time. For anyone with an affection for the innocence of childhood and the infinity of an imagination, this movie is an absolute must."

","Herewith we provide a spoiler-free report. I have seen the film twice now -- the first time, at the U.S. premiere in Shreveport, La. at the Peter Pan Centennial Celebration (which continues through December). The renovated turn-of-the- century Strand theater was a lovely setting for the film, providing consonance with the debut performance of the play 'Peter Pan' as it unfolded on screen.<br/><br/>Before the showing of the film, three writers were on stage: William Joyce (children's book author/illustrator and Shreveport native) and James Hart (screenwriter of 'Hook') also a Shreveport native), who conceived the concept of the Peter Pan Centennial in their hometown, joined by screenwriter David Magee, representing Miramax. Magee said the whole FN project took 6 years from when he started writing it. He made a point of telling the audience that this film was shot BEFORE Johnny Depp played Captain Jack Sparrow. The screenplay and directing were superb. Depp is perfect. Perfection. His performance is understated, touching, gentle, sincere  the camera, the director, the screenwriter et. al. make brilliant use of his eyes. The on-screen chemistry between Johnny and Freddie Highmore is immense -- Johnny has met his match, at last, in this sprite of a child. Now I have an even greater enthusiasm for Charlie & the Chocolate Factory. The other supporting actors do well, including Angus Barnett and Mackenzie Crook who later filmed Pirates of the Caribbean. In essence, the film should be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and, of course, Johnny will be nominated for Best Actor. And this time, my dears, he may take home the statue. The marked contrast between Johnny's portrayal of this character and the next major character he played (Captain Jack) underscores the breadth of his range, and hopefully the Academy will appreciate that. After viewing the film, I had the privilege of attending the high- toned and fancy to-do (dinner), which included a Q & A session with Magee (the screenwriter). My question: 'What did Johnny Depp bring to the role that you did not put down on paper?' At that point, I was under the influence (of Depp as well as alcohol) but I remember that Magee replied Johnny gave a brilliant performance, as expected, with an undercurrent of sadness that was most appropriate for portraying J.M. Barrie. Ah, the Deppth! Upon viewing the film for a second time, I was moved just as much as the first time. One interesting note: the Elton John song that originally played over the credits is now GONE! I guess, after the director and the star both publicly stated they didn't care for it, Miramax decided to delete it. No big loss ... much as I like Elton John, I didn't think the song fit the film."

","What a fabulous performance by all. The story is the star. Is there anything Johnny Depp can't do? A must see for the holidays. Come one, come all. It will touch all hearts that attend. The glimpses of imagination are a welcome change to the seriousness of the world today. This movie proves to be a much needed escape. It is reminiscent of Shadowlands. Johnny Depp as J. M. Barrie rivals the performance of Anthony Hopkins as author C. S. Lewis. Sometimes, the love between two people is too much for this world. It cannot be contained by this life but continues on through eternity. My heart broke for Barrie and the widow Davies. Love finds us when we least expect it. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie. Allow yourself to be vulnerable to it's childlike humor and content.<br/><br/>Find your imagination again."
"EagletHarbin","10","2","2","30 October 2004"," A fantastic film
","Here's what you'll hear about 'Neverland': it's 'Shadowlands,' only with Johnny Depp instead of Anthony Hopkins, and much better. That, to be sure, is the movie in a nutshell, although it does not do it near enough justice. I won't bother going into the plot, but, as everyone knows, Johnny Depp plays J. M. Barrie, Scottish author of the play Peter Pan, in the early 1900s.<br/><br/>The accent is impeccable. You'll forget he's doing one after the first ten minutes, in fact, you'll forget you're watching Johnny Depp (and comparing him to his other roles), after twenty. Some movies are horrible, but watchable because of Depp ('Secret Window'), some are good, but needed Depp's performance to give it the edge it needs ('Pirates of the Caribbean'), but yet others, including this one, are fantastic pictures that have Depp so at the heart of the movie that he becomes the character, and the character becomes him. I could not see 'Neverland' working without Depp, not because he makes a bad film good, but because he is so integral to what the picture is, the two become inseparable. Think of a cake, and Johnny Depp is the sugar.<br/><br/>The movie itself, however, is the flour. It melds together Barrie's imagination and reality in such a way as I've never before see. Marc Foster cuts between shots of Barrie playing with the children to shots of the same people in various fantasy worlds, and the effect is mesmerizing. I was supremely impressed by the cinematography as well. There were numerous times that I simply marveled at a brilliant camera move or framing. Many of those all-important moments that send chills down your spine are also there.<br/><br/>All of the acting is magnificent, especially the little boy playing the child Peter Davies, to whom Barrie takes special attachment to (and for whom Barrie names his titular flying boy), who will also be playing Charlie in the upcoming Burton adaptation of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' next to Depp. Kate Winslet and Julie Christie also impress as Peter's mother and grandmother, respectively. If there is one ill note I felt in the acting, it was in Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Barrie's producer. Hoffman's acting simply felt a little too Hoffman-y for me. Take from that what you will.<br/><br/>The film moves along at a perfect pace. The film was about an hour and a half, although it felt nowhere near that short. In fact, the film began exactly when it should, did not rush through anything, and then ended exactly where it needed to.<br/><br/>Do not expect perfect historical accuracy. The film's opening credits include the title 'Inspired by True Events,' and so do not be surprised when the film deviates from true events, or eliminates people here and there.<br/><br/>How did 'Neverland' stack up, then? Let me put it this way: About halfway through the film I decided that every writer should see this movie. By the end I decided every human should. The picture becomes more than about a writer and the family he loves, it becomes a story about what love is, and how it is best expressed. I cannot describe how incredible the movie is. I won't say that to me it was a life changing experience, but perhaps it will be to many in the audience.<br/><br/>Go see 'Neverland.' 5 stars out of 5."

","I have nothing but praise for this movie.<br/><br/>The grace and ease with which the movie handles the beauty of imagination is startling and moving to watch. Depp must surely scoop some award for this. His performance is mesmerizing and his accent flawless. Winslet, Hoffman and Christie give excellent support, Hoffman demonstrating wry comic timing.<br/><br/>The children in this movie deserve praise also. Often a movie is spoiled by wooden child actors, but the main little character of this drama is a delight to watch, giving a natural and suitably childlike performance.<br/><br/>A brilliant movie that everybody should go to see."

Johnny Depp's portrayal of JM Barrie was one of his best performances to date, moving, enlightening as well as highly comical at times. Kate Winslet as the boys mother is also exceptional, and changed my opinion of her. Haven't ever cried as much as when i saw this. A great acheivment from all involved.

","A simply beautiful and touching film that brought tears of joy and melancholy. Script, performance and direction working as one to bring a magical cinema visit. Not a genuine drama and no more so a biopic of J M Barrie's life, this film takes a look at the times and influences that shaped the writer's penning of Peter Pan. Marc Forster has done a fantastic job and it seems that for the performers it was a labour of love as they infuse every scene with beauty and majesty. Kate Winslet, Julie Christie and the rest of the cast are uniformly excellent but it is Johnny Depp to whom the greatest plaudits must go. I feel he is unsurpassed as an actor who chooses his roles with great integrity. Not for him the easy and lucrative route of blockbuster movies (save for his work in Pirates.. which MADE it a smash), Depp is alone in taking such risks."

"melikah_celeste","2","16","32","16 May 2005"," A Huge Lie of a Movie
","This movie is very touching and would have been a masterpiece had it not been so misleading. <br/><br/>Many historians have called Barrie a pedophile, and for good reason. Barrie was impotent and unable to love women (that is what apparently drove his wife in Gilbert's arms) so he turned his affection to children instead. He would take nude pictures of the 5 Davies boys (does child pornography come to mind?), would write George Davies 2000 letters a day (which were later burned by the family), even in one confessing that he was ' more and more wishing you were a girl of 21 instead of boy, so that I could say the things to you that are now always in my heart '. In his writings (such as 'Little White Bird', read for yourself) he reveals a disturbing and darker side of himself - a sexual desire for children and even his frustration with it. <br/><br/>Even though none of the Davies boys ever said anything about such an incident happening, one is left wondering as to why two of the boys committed suicide. Michael drowned himself with a male friend in some sort of strange pact, and Peter, despite becoming a successful publisher later on in life, threw himself under a train a month before the centenary of Barrie's birth. <br/><br/>The whole of ""Finding Neverland' makes Barrie out to be some sort of loving and very wise father figure when in fact he was a deeply disturbed, lonely, and insecure social outcast who was sexually aroused by children. This is only typical of Hollywood, who the same year produced a movie celebrating another pedophile, Alfred Kinsey.We cannot forget last year's 'Monster', which is done so brilliantly it even makes us feel sorry for serial killer Aileen Wuornos. When one watches this movie after having read about the true twisted character of Barrie, everything about 'Finding Neverland' just seems artificial in essence. <br/><br/>I found it intensely depressing, knowing that with it being such an immaculately made, touching story, not to mention the Oscar nods and rave reviews it received, people who don't care enough to dig any deeper will forever see Barrie as the wonderful, practically perfect human being he is made out to be in 'Finding Neverland'. This movie is a tragedy, just like the lives of the Davies' family and James Barry himself."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","8","14","4 February 2005"," A different Depp, good enough to win an Oscar
","The year was 1987 when I for the first time saw Peter Pan performed on stage, at the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-lake, Ontario, Canada. In complete ignorance, I marveled at how well they reproduce the fairy tale on stage, not knowing that a stage play was the very first form of Peter Pan's existence, in 1904.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland opens with the opening night of a play by James Mathew Barrie (Johnny Depp), a play that becomes an instant box office disaster, to the dismay of its financier Frohman (Dustin Hoffman, in a not much more than cameo role). One angle of looking at the movie could be as the story of how Barrie redeems himself to Frohman by conceiving, writing, and finally showcasing his next play Peter Pan, which turns out to be a roaring success. But that's missing the point..missing the WHOLE point actually.<br/><br/>Peter Pan is about keeping a promise, about believing, about making a dying dream come true, about pure selfless love. With so much goodness put together with such elegant and heartfelt filming, it is hard to find a dry eye in the cinema when the audience is brought to ending climax, when Neverland is found. Some may fault the actual entrance into Neverland as an overkill. However, the way to look at this scene is of course as something symbolic rather than real. It is a link between what Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet) physically experiences in watching the play and what she mentally experiences in her final moments.<br/><br/>The journey in search of Neverland in a shared experience between Barrie and the Davies family (widow Sylvia and 4 boys). Shunning conventional society, Barrie finds immense pleasure in playing with the Davies kids who in turn become his muse for Peter Pan (one of the 4 kids is called Peter). Quite illuminating however is a scene during the intermission of the successful opening night, when the appreciative audience, upon hearing the name of Peter Davies, exclaim in mirth, ""So you are Peter Pan"". Without a moment's hesitation, the little boy replies in a matter-of-course manner, ""No, he is Peter Pan"", pointing at Barrie.<br/><br/>Winslet is excellent, particularly as the role she plays is not terribly challenging. Her Oscar nomination, therefore, is rather for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Not a trace of Depp's characteristic eccentricity is seen in his portrayal of the gentle, sensible, courageous man who befriends this widow, not so much even out of kindness or charity, but purely as one human soul that happens to click with another. Hope he wins this year's Oscar.<br/><br/>There are two supporting roles. Julie Christie playing Sylvia's traditional-thinking mother is somewhat one-dimensional. Radha Mitchell, who seems to come from the same line as Jessica Lange and Robin Wright, is a delightful surprise playing Barrie's wife. Her two previous roles that I've seen, in Phone Booth and Man on Fire, were more straightforward. Playing Mary Ansell Barrie requires some depth to avoid making it one-dimensional like Christie's character. Mitchell's underplaying the character is successful in making it believable and even sympathy-earning.<br/><br/>From what I've heard of other contestants, Finding Neverland does not seem to have a good chance of bringing home the Oscar. But it certainly deserves its place ""with the rest of them, and the best of them"" (Barbara Streisand in ""Hello Dolly"")."

"personare","1","18","39","11 February 2005"," Bad composition, Bad story-telling, Bad imagery, Bad character depiction
","This movie relied heavily on (1) simplistic facial expression set in predictable scenes, and (2) the basic outline of the story featuring cliché message encouraging laughter and imagination. Everything else was distasteful. The director did a terrificly horrible job. He was bad.<br/><br/>(I) Problem of Image:<br/><br/>(a) Most shots remained too close to the actors' upper body... little variety in composition... the transition became monotone... the background was not well utilized...<br/><br/>(b) The image quality was ordinary... nothing special... very movie...<br/><br/>(c) The beauty of the time or stage was not used...<br/><br/>(d) The theatrical and fantasy scenes lacked imagination...<br/><br/>(* The rare good image was of Depp and Pete at the end. Most of the rest were junk.)<br/><br/>(II) Problem of Story:<br/><br/>(a) The character depictions went from surface to surface... There's Depp writing a little... There's his wife who reads a little bit... complains a little... There's Winslet who's a mother and who says Depp is fine... There's Winslet mom who's a little worried but who becomes quickly open to Depp... There's the children, who's cute or mature or rebellious or touching at times... There's Hoffman worried about money but who eventually recognizes Depp's achievement... But no depth... Nor is there great imagery... We see a bit of Peter Pan... just a tiny little petty bits... We have a tiny bit of fantasy... Very biographic movie... with little actual life in it.<br/><br/>(Why did Depp get together with his wife... Depp seems very nice but also very weak... There's mention of the neglect of his mother... envy towards his brother... there's a sense that Depp's character is far more problematic than the movie depicts... most of Hoffman's character is left unknown... we don't get a good sense of who he is, and why... This movie could of been better if it depicted Depp as someone more sad... and the kids fate (childhood to their suicides and accidental deaths in actual life) as a tragicomedy of life... the mothers as sad object and embodiment of instinctive affection and traditional society... a more kubrick version of this film with a tim burton orientation would of been better than the current ""i'm so sweet"" version.)<br/><br/>(b) The message about imagination is conveyed with little fantasy... Most scenes are very earthly in a boring sense... Most shots are face oriented... thus dependent on facial gestures... while the general image quality is ordinary... The characters display simple emotions within a predictable cliché situation... The result is plain.<br/><br/>(c) The message about belief is conveyed with strong reliance on the sickness and death of the mother... (We're supposed to swallow the message by the power of the tragedy of her situation... and the need to overcome it... ) The distinction between good and bad belief is unclear... And the importance of believing and imagining is only affirmed in a microcosmic way (in relation to the mother) and thus the message remains shallow in a broad scope... The movie shows little of what Depp achieves with imagination... we just see bits of his play... that tries to be cute and moralistic, but risks being just cheesy and preachy because they lack both sophistication of words and craftiness of composition. And the movie shows little of what anyone else achieves with imagination.<br/><br/>Imo, ""Finding Neverland"" stinks."
"bob the moo","Null","16","34","9 November 2004"," An enjoyable film, but its sense of wonder undermines its status as a real and emotionally involving story
","With yet another disappointing play under his belt, JM Barrie is understandably down, and a cold and distant relationship with his wife doesn't help simulate his creative juices. Writing in the local park as he does, Barrie meets widow Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies and her four sons. Enjoying his day with the children, Barrie gets to know Sylvia and become her friend; however the social circle that Barrie moves in looks down on such relationships and the whole thing further damages his marriage. However it is in his friendship and imaginative playing that Barrie finds his inspiration and begins writing what will turn out to be his most successful and memorable play.<br/><br/>On the basis of a five star review from Empire Magazine and the presence of the ever worth a risk Johnny Depp, I came to this film without a great love of Peter Pan or Barrie and it was more the appeal of the actor that drew me more than it was the man Barrie. Maybe it is for this reason that I enjoyed the film but was not totally won over by it in the same way as many other viewers seem to have been; maybe it is because I didn't approach the film filled with the sense of wonder that the film drops on us and, although I recognise how important it was to the film, I couldn't help feeling that it also took away from the reality of the story at the same time. The plot was interesting but I was more interested in the real side of the story that I was in the flights of imaginative fancy that it regularly heads off on. I enjoyed these scenes as well but they only had value beyond adding a sense of wonder to the film and to the story whereas I felt the film gave short change to the actual reality of the story  especially the scandal around Barrie and Sylvia's friendship and the decay of Barrie's marriage.<br/><br/>In a way is that the film wanted to be too full of wonder and shy away from the darker stuff that made it lose some of its impact and appeal to me. It seemed that either issues were simplified or they were simply resolved (or lessened) by Barrie's insistence that things could be solved by just going into your imagination and so on. However this does the alleged darker side of the story a disservice because, although we hear of the chatter of paedophilia (a claim the boys have always totally denied) the story tends to make things like Barrie's marriage break-up and so on easier to swallow by encouraging us to see his marriage as already at an end (and we are encourage to blame his wife) and also to look more to the wonder he brought that the harm that we know he was actually causing to the Llewelyn-Davies family. Of course to bring these out would have damaged the sense of wonder the rest of the film encourages us to buy into and would have made this a different and less sweet affair, but would have been more interesting to me.<br/><br/>If anything it wants to be too 'nice' and full of wonder  and real life is rarely that way or that morally simple.<br/><br/>Of course many people will not have come to this film for Barrie but for Depp and they will not be disappointed because, moral simplicity aside, Depp gives an assured performance the likes of which we have come to expect from him over the course of his career. The Scottish accent is pretty good although quite soft and therefore kept accessible to the American market. He does well with both the imagined stuff but also with the difficult emotional stuff  Depp managing to put in the complexity that really the script should have helped him with more. Winslet is OK but rather simplistic and too easily sweet and played in contrast with her mother and Barrie's wife. She is a good actress here but didn't have much to really work with. Therefore Christie and Mitchell are not as good as they should have been  certainly Mitchell was done a great disservice as the film simply had no time for her pain or longing to have been involved in her husband's world in the same way as Davies was. Highmore was impressive and he is the main person to keep the film in reality with his outburst of pain; he too falls in with the wonder by the end but at times his pain and confusion is very engaging and refreshingly convincing and real. Hoffman was a strange find but he is a welcome addition  his distinctive presence complimented by a handful of amusing lines that more than cover for the fact that he does seem a little out of place in turn of the century England! People like Ian Hart and Paul Whitehouse barely make an impression but it is nice to see them anyway.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good film but in a way the sense of wonder that many people have praised was also one of its weaknesses. Instead of being a real story that showed the complex emotions of the situation (even the simplified situation seen here) the film tends to err on the side of wonder and shirks away from the difficult issues that would have left the audience unsure whether to really root for Barrie or not and instead enjoys itself on its flights of fancy. It still have enough emotion and wonder to make it an enjoyable film that is worth seeing but I couldn't help feeling that it really was going for easy targets and avoiding things that would make things more difficult for both it and its audience."

The story begins with Barrie wholly concerning himself with his work, leaving an unfortunate rift between him and his down-to-earth, sensible wife. His social encounters with the Davies's after he meets them, in contrast, opens his imagination to new revelations: What makes a fantasy truly engaging? Inspiring? Therapeutic? The children, in effect, are encouraged to deal with life's difficulties through their imaginations.

","With just a bit of reining in the schmaltz ""Finding Neverland"" could have gone beyond a very good movie to an excellent film. <br/><br/>The film is at its best when, like ""Topsy Turvy,"" it shows how an artist creates a beloved masterwork. Grounding the story in the theater helps us enter into James Barrie's head very effectively, such that it's just a small step for us to join him into the Imagi-Nation (as Kris Kringle called it in ""Miracle on 34th Street""). <br/><br/>It is much more convincing than ""Big Fish"" in showing us the power of the storyteller because it is related more to the joys of the child in all of us rather than the avoidance of maturity, though that's how other adult characters chide Barrie. I presume it is intentional that Barrie's real life seems so drab compared to his fantasies, but it is a bit stiff to watch. <br/><br/>The child actors are at their best when they are not miniature Edwardian adults but are rambunctious brothers like the no-necked monsters in ""Desperate Housewives."" It's a relief to see in film that not all upper class Britons were banished to strict boarding schools. While mildly dealing with rumors about the nature of Barrie's relationship with the mother and her children, David Magee's script is weakened when he has the younger boys talk preternaturally like adults, especially when it is solely for tear jerking effect. The oldest brother's gradual acceptance of adult responsibility is convincing, but Peter is just a shade short of annoying. <br/><br/>The biggest weakness in the film is the maudlin handling of the illness of Kate Winslet's character, which is as old-fashioned a decorous cinematic portrayal of consumption as Greta Garbo in ""Camille."" Could she not have at least been made up to look less radiantly healthy or did she only have Terminal Movie Starness?<br/><br/>Julie Christie and Radha Mitchell have thankless, one-dimensional roles, but make the most of what they're given to work with and only the former gets to prove she believes in fairies."

The little boy who played Peter (his name has escaped me at this moment) was brilliant, I am really looking forward to seeing him in other films, he is a wonderful little actor. When I went to go see this I was with my parents and no one in the theater (except maybe the really young girls who snuck in halfway through and were more interested in the boys they had brought with them) wasn't crying for the last thirty minutes of this film. I am such a slanted viewer though because as a child my favorite movie was Disney's cartoon version of Peter Pan and then when they made the live action Peter Pan in 2003 I remember how much magic was in Neverland. This was just another step for me in loving the world that J.M. Barry created.<br/><br/>I really recommend you go see this movie.

Johnny Depp fails to excite imagination, interest, or much more than a yawn or wince. Kate Winslet does not outdo her co-star. The language and etiquette of 1901 is completely ignored, in a way that makes it seem as if a modern story were happening in old costumes. I was especially disturbed by the fact that the film has garnered such high evaluations among critics and film-goers alike. It is nevertheless worthless, a waste of time. Your imagination deserves much more than this film can hope to inspire. I can only assume the makers of this movie were taking the advice of ""believing"" to heart, and thought that if they ""believed"" this atrocious mess were successful, then it would be.

The playwright--Johnny Depp--watches the audience from behind the curtains as they drift off into boredom. Soon, the rain outside the set begins to pour onto and drence the audience, presumably symbolizing the failure of the play to entertain. Frankly, this scene is prophetic of the movie overall."

","For the longest time, I was wary of watching this. It struck me as being quite Oscar-friendly and very much a period chick-flick. Therefore, I'd like to extend my deepest sympathies to ""Finding Neverland"" and everyone connected with it because this is a sublime picture that is full of zeal and enthusiasm. It is also the first movie I've seen that accurately shows what it is like being a writer (as I am one myself) with glorious flights of fancy that are both wonderful to witness and (at last!) do not detract from the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp puts in one of the finest performances in his career as the author of Peter Pan, J.M. Barrie. After his latest play flops in London's West End, Barrie begins a friendship with the four children of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and finds his inspiration for his next play, a story about a boy who never grows up - ""Peter Pan"". But the relationship between the Davies' and Barrie puts a tremendous strain on his wife (Radha Mitchell) as well as Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie).<br/><br/>It is truly staggering how different Depp is here from his role in ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" - here, he is controlled and graceful and his Scottish accent is impeccable. But Depp faces strong competition from the four child actors (Freddie Highmore, Joe Prospero, Nick Roud & Luke Spill) who are also fantastic as the Davies' children. The film also looks superb, with a relentless turn-of-the-century feel for the most part and a surreal dream-like quality during Barrie's flights of fancy when his and the boys' imagination takes over. And while a film based on how a play is written doesn't sound that gripping, it never fails to captivate and hold your attention. My one gripe is that it's a bit too similar to ""Shakespeare In Love"" but given how extraordinary that film was, that is hardly criticism - indeed, it is mighty praise for a film that surprised and entertained me for every minutes of its duration.<br/><br/>I'd happily recommend this film to almost anybody. It's imaginative, emotive and gloriously realised - such a shame that it didn't win more Oscars because this is one of the best films to be released this side of the millennium. It's one of the finest pieces of escapism I've seen and I defy anyone not to feel choked at the end. It's a great date movie as well as fabulous family entertainment, although young children may find their attention wandering. Most of all, it's an intelligent and beautifully produced ""writers"" movie which, if we're honest, don't come along very often. If you haven't seen it then believe the hype - this is one movie you simply have to see, even if you're not a fan of period dramas (like myself). Depp does it again."

What more could you want from £6.<br/><br/>The acting. Johnny Depp is the finest actor of his generation, here he produces a subtle but powerful performance, never upstaging his co-stars Kate Winslet too is sublime, in a part that could have come across as a bit wet she brings some real spark and humour. Julie Christie is a classy actress and her she proves her mettle managing to be tough and turn it round to generate heighten the touching scenes towards the end of the film. What a find Freddie Highmore is, there are no need for the obvious comparisons so I won't make them, suffice to say his scene in the garden breaks your heart, I think that might be where I started crying, or was it before.<br/><br/>The scene where Barrie brings the cast of Peter Pan to the house because Sylvia is dying and he wants her to see into his imagination is one of the most moving things i've seen. It is also beautiful. In fact the whole film is shot perfectly. So what are you waiting for go and see it you will not be disappointed."

","Finding Neverland is a bit of a sleeper movie. A movie that you have to discover on your own, I mean, I wasn't in a huge rush to see this in the theater, nor when it came out on DVD, but I did get a chance to view it via the library (yay libraries!) and I was quite charmed and of course emotional by the biography of James Barrie, more specifically, about how he got to write Peter Pan.<br/><br/>I never knew that the story for Peter Pan was so personal to Barrie, and the movie here is a wonderful illustration of how Barrie used elements, mainly with his interaction with a widow's children, to put the play together. The movie uses fantasy and the real world flawlessly to build an excellent narrative.<br/><br/>And what of Johnny Depp? His acting here is flawless, and had every right to be nominated for an Academy Award (He should've won! Boo Jamie Foxx!). It also helps that he's accompanied by some amazing actors, Kate Winslet of course, but I really liked the woman playing Barrie's wife, Radha Mitchell, who I've never seen before, she was quite good, and of course, the always amazing Julie Christie. Also worth noting is one of my acting heroes, Ian Hart, has a blip of a role as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. You Gotta Love That!"

I think people have gotten used to him playing strange characters so they are reluctant to accept him in this role, but he proves that he is a truly talented actor.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet also shows her skill as Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, the widow trying to cope with four young boys and a meddling mother-in-law (Julie Christie, at her best!)

","The boundless imagination of James Mattew Barrie the man behind 'Peter Pan', the classic literature that speaks to the child in all of us. Finding Neverland traverses both fantasy and everyday reality, melding the difficulties and heartbreak of adult life with the spellbinding allure and childlike innocence of the boy who never grows up. An emotional tale. It all begins with the successful Scottish playwright J.M Barrie watching the opening of his latest play to the ho-hum reaction among the polite society of Edwardian England. A literary genius of his times but bored of the same old themes, Barrie is clearly in need of some serious inspiration. Unexpectedly he finds it one day on his daily walk with his dog in a London park. Barrie encounters four fatherless boys and their beautiful recently widowed mother. Despite the disapproval of the boy's grandmother and the resentment of his own wife, Barrie becomes a good friend to the family, engaging the boys in tricks, disguises, games and sheer mischief, creating play-worlds of castles and kings, cowboys and Indians, pirates and castaways. He transforms hillsides into galleon ships, sticks into mighty swords, kites into enchanted fairies and the four kids into the lost boys of Neverland."

","For quite a few years now it has been common knowledge that Johnny Depp is one of the best actors (young or old), if films.

He has taken on what may appear to be a more conventional role, and turned it into a masterpiece of understanding and communicating who J.M.

To see his Barrie is to understand the desire to help ""transport"" yourself or loved ones to a place that they can believe in.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is nothing short of exquisite. Marc Forster has crafted a superb film, and while moving some facts around, never gives the story a sense of artificiality.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is superb as well.

"Snow4849","8","2","3","11 August 2005"," Do You Believe in Fairies?
","How fine is the line between fantasy and reality? And if we unleash our imaginations, just how far will they take us? These are two questions explored by Marc Foster's beautiful ""Finding Neverland."" JM Barrie is a lonely author stuck in a loveless marriage to a social-climbing wife and a suffocating world of adult primness until he finds creative muses  four of them, to be exact  in young brothers George, Jack, Peter, and Michael Davies. Though he also strikes up an instant friendship with their beautiful widowed mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet), it is clear that her sons are the real magnet. With his powerful imagination, Barrie creates a series of magical adventures for the boys ... until Sylvia's failing health and eventual death intrude upon their world of make-believe.<br/><br/>The weepy scenes are many, but there are definitely laughs in-between. In one scene, Barrie is asleep in bed with a tuft of blondish hair under the covers beside him, assumed to be his wife until the covers are thrown back to reveal his brilliant pet dog, Porthos. (Besides changing his breed from St. Bernard to Newfoundland, the movie took almost no liberties with Porthos.) Earlier, Barrie commands Porthos to stand on his hind legs, takes hold of his paws, and says in the most passionate, serious voice, ""Dance with me!"" I don't know how Johnny Depp did it without laughing! The two share a merry waltz in the middle of the park. Throughout the film, Depp's Barrie manages to keep his feet on the ground while his head is in the clouds, but in real life, Barrie's overactive imagination often gave him problems in distinguishing fantasy from reality.<br/><br/>Though Depp is brilliant as usual, he is nearly acted off-screen by young Freddie Highmore, whose ability to convey so many powerful emotions through a single glance or sigh is simply amazing. His glowing performance makes it crystal clear why Barrie chooses Peter as the namesake of his greatest masterpiece, the boy who never grew up. Though Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman), Barrie's grudging producer, is skeptical throughout the film that ""Peter Pan"" will be a hit  even calling it ""my nightmare"" on opening night  its instant success soon eclipses Barrie's recent theater flops. It would later go onto eclipse his forty other plays and dominate his life, but that's a depressing tale for another time. (In real life, Frohman was devoted to making Peter Pan a hit, and Barrie was the one full of doubt.) At a private performance of the play for the Davies family, Peter Pan turns to them and asks the famous plea to clap their hands. The four boys are all too awestruck to clap ... until their stuffy grandmother, who has spent the entire movie disapproving of Barrie and his fun with the boys, positively bangs her hands together to save Tinkerbell's life. More than anything, her actions capture the magical spell that ""Peter Pan"" still holds over any audience. I was clapping my hands, too. The movie truly made me believe.<br/><br/>Look closely and you will spot an actual member of the Davies family. In reality, there was a fifth Davies brother, Nicholas, called Nico, born in 1903. Nico married in 1926 and welcomed his only child, Laura, in 1928. Laura appears in ""Finding Neverland."" Just after the first performance of ""Peter Pan,"" she is the theater patron who says to Freddie Highmore (playing her real-life uncle), ""This is Peter Pan! How wonderful!"" She is credited under her married name, Laura Duguid. I would like to add that I have read several biographies of JM Barrie, beginning since long before this movie was released, and that the rumors of pedophilia are totally untrue. Barrie loved the Davies children platonically, not sexually, and both of the boys's parents considered him a friend  though they were sometimes bewildered by the author's oddities, and quite understandably so."
"pyrocitor","10","2","3","23 May 2005"," True Magic
","Who would have thought the life of playwrite J.M. Barrie could be as exciting as his most famous story about a troupe of lost boys? It seems to be pretty close here, as Finding Neverland details the life of Barrie (Depp) as he writes his most famous play, Peter Pan. Barrie is inspired by watching a family of boys playing in the park, accompanied by their mother Syliva (Winslet). Barrie begins playing with the boys more and more often, as their youthful imaginations help him to remember his own, and inspire him to write a play of true magic.<br/><br/>Director Marc Forster couldn't possibly have made a more different film than his last, the extremely dramatically heavy Monster's Ball - in fact, just about all they have in common is that both are quality works. And Finding Neverland is indeed a quality work, with Forster throwing in little magic touches here and there (the door to Barrie's bedroom shows a vast, sweeping landscape, representing the fantastic dreams he will have) and some superb cinematography to give the audience a sort of portal into Barrie's incredible imagination. (the camera flies, fairy like, over the audience watching Peter Pan for the first time, set to a soundtrack of children's laughter)<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, while using a great Scottish accent, is a joy to watch as Barrie, the man who was never afraid to be a child again. He proves yet again that few actors of his generation are capable of so totally immersing themselves into a character, and playing them to the fullness of their ability. Kate Winslet is also terrific, if not quite matching Depp's level, as the harried mother of the children Barrie befriends. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, even Sylvia's children turn out to be excellent actors, in particular newcomer Freddie Highmore, playing Peter, an overly serious who tries to grow up too quickly after the death of his father. Julie Christie is a strong presence as the snotty ""you love to hate her"" mother of Sylvia, who tries to prevent Barrie from spending time with their family, because it lowers the family's social standing. But she isn't just the stereotypical evil grandmother - her character has much more depth than that, and we are actually allowed an explanation for her snide ways. Dustin Hoffman also has a brief but essential appearance as Charles Frohman, the producer of Barrie's plays who is skeptical of the magical content in his benefactor's latest. Hoffman proves his standing as an iconic actor, raising many a chuckle in a few all too brief scenes.<br/><br/>It's an astonishingly flawless piece of work - pitch perfect performances all around propelling a wonderful script, all handled by a terrific and capable director with a wonderful sense of story and magic. With little touches of imagination sprinkled throughout, Finding Neverland perfectly captures the tone of magic and wonder that Barrie's play was supposed to instill in the first place. It's a shame there are so few films which turn out so uniformly beautiful as this.<br/><br/>-10/10"

","Peter Pan has been a childhood classic for years but never before has it been told from this angle. Johnny Depp plays J.M.Barrie, a playwright desperate for some inspiration for a new play. He meets and forms a tight friendship with a widow (Kate Winslet) and her 4 boys who are struggling to keep their life in order. This friendship then gives Barrie the much needed inspiration for the idea of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp arguably does his best performance to date and he is able to accomplish this without smashing plates, or giving a dramatic soliloquies. His performance is subtle and tender. And his hard work echoed in his Best Actor nomination last February. On the ladies side, Kate Winslet is absolutely lovely in this film. She's has grace and tragedy and by half way through the film, she has completely won over the audience's warmth and love. Glimpses of neverland itself are tear jerking. When you sit back, and watch the amazing beauty of a heaven like world dance in front of you, it's hard not to get choke back some mist. Despite the warm fluttery feeling I felt when leaving the theatre, I can't seem to give this film a 10. This is mainly due to pace but the music and gorgeous visuals keep the score at a solid eight.<br/><br/>It's a gorgeous film with love, beauty, and imagination that shouldn't be missed.

"howard.schumann","8","2","3","14 February 2005"," Captures the spirit of innocence
","In a culture that worships youth, the most logical step of course is not to grow up, something a few people I know are working on. Their role model is Peter Pan or the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up, a play by J.M. Barrie, first performed in 1904. Though it is speculated that Barrie wrote Peter Pan to immortalize his dead brother David as the perfect child, conventional wisdom suggests that the story emerged from tales told to the five sons of Arthur and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, boys to whom Barrie grew close and eventually became guardian. Though Barrie was a questionable figure with many hints about his dark side, in Marc Forster's Finding Neverland, his life is dramatized as wholesome family entertainment without a trace of ambivalence, sexual or otherwise.<br/><br/>According to Anthony Lane, ""He (Barrie) was short and slight, with bags under his eyes and a pale, protuberant brow, like a clever schoolboy who has stayed up late reading books under the bedclothes. He had a heavy mustache and a pipe smoker's percussive cough"". Johnny Depp plays Barrie in a convincingly understated manner though in fact he looks nothing like him. As the film opens, Barrie is undergoing an artistic crisis. His latest play is a failure and he is without inspiration, prodded to do better by Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman), his money conscious producer. His marriage faltering for reasons only hinted at, his prospects dubious, Barrie encounters a family of four bright youngsters, ages 5 to 12, and their widowed mother (Kate Winslet) relaxing in the neighborhood park and Barrie is ""drawn"" to the boys.<br/><br/>Together they put on improvised plays, fly homemade kites in the park, play cowboys and Indians in the backyard, and dress up as pirates, activities which laid the groundwork for what became Peter Pan. The meetings become regular and the boys start to refer to him as Uncle Jim. He offers them use of the summer cottage that he and Mary never use, and they are very grateful. All are spared the distasteful experience of having to grow up. Their relationship raises eyebrows in Victorian London, however, and Sylvia's stern mother (Julie Christie) accuses Barrie of harming her daughter's chances of getting her life together and remarrying. Barrie begins to write again and develops a play about a young boy who takes his friends to a place called Neverland where no one ever grows up and the rest is history (or speculative fiction as the case may be).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp delivers Barrie as sweet and loving, without a devious bone in his body and Winslet is strong in the role of the widowed mother who is gradually developing a serious lung disease. The highlight of the film, however, may be the performance of young Freddie Highmore as the real Peter, the boy who has grown up too fast. Though Finding Neverland is a sanitized version of real events, it engagingly captures the spirit of innocence in danger of disappearing from our modern life and it can be enjoyed on its own merits. If the influence of the Davies family brought out the best in Barrie, perhaps it can do the same for us, stimulating a generation grown cynical into recapturing the spirit of their inner child."

","Fable<br/><br/>""Children should never be made to go to bedthey wake up a day older"". This statement by James Matthew Barrie, creator of 'Peter Pan, Or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up', in director Marc Forster's moving and reassuring fable, 'Finding Neverland', captures the quintessence of the film. Based on the original play, 'The Man Who Was Peter Pan' by Allan Knee, this cinematic adaptation has at its core a very simple but true message- if only we believe, we can preserve our innocence(and in the world we live, that is the single most difficult thing to preserve).<br/><br/>J.M. Barrie(Johnny Depp), coming out from a theatrical disaster(his recent play has been lambasted by the critics), meets the Davies boys in a summer that would lead to his creation of Peter Pan. Barrie, himself never having lived his own childhood(his brother died when Barrie was a child, and his mother called him by his brother's name to fill her void), finds in the boys a purity that enthralls him to an extent where it begins to feed the artist and the locked up child within him. Barrie starts to frequent the Davies household causing much uproar, albeit hushed, in the Victorian circles. Both, his relationship with Sylvia Davies(Kate Winslet)- the widowed mother of the children, and his intent behind spending afternoons with young kids are questioned. But to Barrie, this is an opportunity to imagine as he has never done before and perhaps also, a chance to repair. A chance to repair the childhood that he had lost by infusing it in Peter Davies(Freddie Highmore), a boy who seems to have grown up too soon. Barrie creates a world of wonder around the boys by weaving imagination and we can see his next play taking shape. And in Barrie's imagination(as he must've preferred in reality), Peter transforms into Peter Pan- the boy who wouldn't grow up!<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is a rare actor who doesn't allow his good looks to limit his acting range. His performance as Barrie is near perfect. Watch how his closeness to Sylvya never translates into attraction. Similarly, notice his coldness when in the company of his wife, Mary(Radha Mitchell), and the merry glint in his eyes when with the children. Depp's performance is worthy of his Oscar nomination. Kate Winslet excels as the ailing widow, but we have come to expect good performances from her. Radha Mitchell is a revelation in her small part and Dustin Hoffman adds his own style of dry wit in a small role as Charles Frohman- Barrie's impresario. But the standout performance is by Freddie Highmore as Peter- the boy who inspired Peter Pan. Freddie performs remarkably and tugs at your heart every time he speaks. The emotional array that this kid covers is unbelievable, and his is-without a doubt- one of the best child performances in years. <br/><br/>David Magee, the man behind the screen adaptation, keeps his screenplay fluid and uncomplicated. He knows that this is not a biopic. Thus, taking liberties, he uses the prospect to tell a magical tale where all you need is imagination. As Frohman points out in the movie, ""The critics have made it importantbut what is it? What?...It is a play!"" Sometimes all we need is a little imagination. No waitthat is all we need! And the boy shall never grow!<br/><br/><ul><li>Abhishek Bandekar</li></ul><br/><br/>Note- 'Finding Neverland' is nominated in seven categories at this year's Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor(Johnny Depp) and Best Adapted Screenplay(David Magee).<br/><br/>Rating- ****<br/><br/>* Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent<br/><br/>30th January, 2005"

","I don't cry at movies. No eyes welling up . . as a rule. Okay, I cried during Henry V (the Kenneth Branagh version) when the French army slaughtered all the pages in the English camp. I don't even tend to care for movies that might make me cry. I spend my hard earned big screen cash on movies with big effects or epic vistas ( think The Matrix or The Lord Of the Ring) Finding Neverland was a glorious exception. <br/><br/>Beautifully acted, sweet but not syrupy and perfect for a break from all the holiday madness, Finding Neverland was a true gem. I don't believe its for as young of a crowd as I watched it with ( the 4 year old beside me was constantly needing plot clarification from her mother) but both my 47 year old husband & my 32 year old self were enchanted! In this jaded day & age it was a relief to see a movie that had romance without overt sexuality, a PLOT , and true emotion without sentimentality. And where did they find these child actors? Luke Spill, Joe Prospero, Nick Roud and especially Freddie Highmore were excellent. Rarely have I seen children perform on screen so realistically and charmingly. I'm sure they'll all have brilliant futures if they chose to stay in the business.<br/><br/>I would say something here about Johnny Depp but what is there to say? Besides, I'm biased- I've never seen a Johnny Depp movie I didn't like, & I'm sure I've seen ALMOST every one! Julie Christie was a powerhouse playing a difficult character in the most likable way. <br/><br/>Don't let this movie slip under your radar! Finding Neverland will warm your heart without your having to turn off your brain. By the way, if you have a soul, take some tissues to use at the movies end."

When leaving the theater, the crowd not only clapped but everyone was wiping the tears from their eyes from crying, including me.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet both deserve Oscars for the performances and the movie deserves an Oscar nomination as well.<br/><br/>Very worth seeing and this is one of the few movies that if it had cost $20 dollars to see, I would still want to see it 5 times or more.<br/><br/>The job Depp was able to do in describing his character and the job Winslet did in playing the job of the mother was outstanding.

EVERY movie or show I have seen him in he does such a superb job of acting, from a small child up into adulthood now. The phenomenal way he can portray his emotions on screen makes ME feel them, and with the massive numbers of movies and shows I have seen in my lifetime, there are very few actors that can illicit that kind of response from me anymore!

","12 December 2004. The beginning 20 or 30 minutes of the film seemed to move with slow, almost languid movements that threatened to put me to sleep. There were suggestive flights of fancy such as ""Big Fish"" that never seemed to quite push the envelope of delight. Nevertheless and overlooking John Depp's accent, this movie build slowly and like a magic present, it kept unfolding its mysterious until the fantasy and the poignant reality met in the great bittersweet ending. The tender, unassuming relational angles and tensions, the backdrop of a Peter Pan Classic, the suggestive hints of humor of Dustin Hoffman, and the underlying premise of childhood and adulthood all packaged into a resonating exposure onto the big screen is a feast for the eyes and mind. Eight out of Ten Stars."
"classicsoncall","8","1","1","7 April 2018"," ""Well, I have always wanted to go to Neverland.""
","Simply a charming and wonderful movie. I'm even going to refrain from immediately researching the life of JM Barrie as I don't want it to intrude on the magic of the film; I can always do that later. Of course there will be naysayers who trash the picture, I'm no longer surprised by those kinds of reactions ever since I read the negative reviews on IMDb for ""The Wizard of Oz"". However unlike some, I won't castigate those who don't like either of these movies, but it would be welcome if some considered reasons were put forward instead of offering clichéd put-downs. <br/><br/>I think this might be the only time I've seen Johnny Depp in a role portraying a normal type of character. The last movie I saw him in, he was slashing throats as Sweeney Todd, so this was quite a departure from characters like the Demon Barber, Edward Scissorhands or Jack Sparrow. He offered a decidedly reserved portrayal of the author JM Barrie and played wonderfully against the four young actors representing the Llewelyn Davies siblings. <br/><br/>I guess the best word to describe the movie is that it was magical, and I think that word would apply for viewers both children and adults. I think it's a good idea to indulge in magic every once in a while because that's the kind of thing that keeps one young at heart and young in spirit. A picture like this makes us aware of that fact, and if one ever needs a reminder, the best advice comes from the movie itself - just believe."

"ElMaruecan82","8","1","1","10 March 2017"," Never too late to find your 'Neverland' and that goes for kids, too
","Children are so impressionable their general perception of grown-ups is of very serious, capable and knowledgeable persons. Still, kids rarely envy adults to the point of wishing to trade places and stop playing games that exalt and satisfy their imagination. It works differently with adults, they have freedom, power and responsibilities but now and then, they give enough rope to the inner child so they can have a little fun and play.<br/><br/>Indeed, before being the movie about James Barrie, author of ""Peter Pan"", who inspired the infamous syndrome of the same name, the film is about playing. It opens with a play that flopped with the audience, much to the stoic desperation of the theater's manager, played by Dustin Hoffman. Barrie is wondering how come a popular and fun art such as theater turned into a pompous and boring depository of aristocratic distractions. The manager, who's not your usual bloodsucker executive but a rather understanding person, simply reminds Barrie of the name of their creations: plays. This is a film that often says a lot with a brilliant economy of words.<br/><br/>And as an immediate illustration, the next scene shows Barrie playing Indians with the four sons of Mrs. Sylvia Llewellyn Davies, half a Du Maurier and a widow, played with poignant vulnerability by Kate Winslet. She didn't find in Barrie a substitute for her deceased husband but a playmate for her boys. And Barrie's fertile imagination enables him to find each day a new game, a new source of inspiration. So you have a man whose business is to make plays: to pretend, to create new realities, and doing the same thing during his spare-time. You never can tell when Barrie is working or when he's having fun, in fact, he can't tell either. The only certitude is that his last play lost money and he must come up with something really good, time has come to make his masterpiece.<br/><br/>We know where this is all leading to and all through that growing relationship between James and Sylvia, and the children, we have glimpses of Peter Pan's world slowly emerging, and the stronger the bonds get, the more it fuels James' imagination. But the play isn't the end in Marc Forster's movie; the focal point is the relationships, between Barrie and the kids and especially Peter, played by Freddie Highmore. After his father's death, Peter has grown up too fast and still blames his mother for having 'sugarcoated' the news. Peter embodies the precocious maturity of children who have to deal with a loved one's death and in his attempt to resurrect his faith in childhood fantasy; Barrie must also help him to deal with the worlds' sad realities, such as his mother's current illness.<br/><br/>This challenge is at the core of the creative juice that made Peter Pan such a masterpiece of poetry, that and the instinct of Barrie who rightfully ordered to keep places for orphans at the opening night so that their laughter could convince the adults to watch the play with their childhood eyes. Some adults though seem immune to that capability: two subplots involve the tense relationship with Mrs. Du Maurier, Sylvia's no-nonsense mother (Julie Christie) and Mrs. Barrie (Rhada Mitchell). Both women can't indulge a man playing with children, as a full-time occupation. How can you ever teach them that there's a time to be serious and a time for fun when an adult doesn't set the example?<br/><br/>But that might be the essence of the Peter Pan's syndrome: you don't accept a time for being serious. Peter does and this is why at the premiere, he says he's not Peter Pan, Barrie is. In fact, Barrie is as much an adult as all the others and the making of Peter Pan was a project he took very seriously, he was just lucky enough to have a job where fun plays a major part. ""Finding Neverland"" might say something about acting in general, an adult way to do kid's stuff or like recent Oscar-winner Viola Davis said, the art that celebrates what life is about. ""Finding Neverland"" like Forster's ""Stranger than Fiction"", is a self-reflexive gem that celebrates the inner poetry of life.<br/><br/>And Johnny Depp's performance is pivotal because he doesn't fall in the trap of caricature; he doesn't pull an 'Ed Wood' or worse, a 'Willy Wonka' in his acting. Had Depp overplayed the eccentricity of Barrie, he would have looked like a big child, a weirdo whose fantasy creation could have as well been the product of some drugs' consumption. But by being an adult who only acts like a clown for 'adult' reasons, his Barrie turns into a fascinating character, both a subject and an object of existential studies. He tries to drain from kids' imagination some universal ideas about the world while translating it into his language and making the story understandable by adults.<br/><br/>He becomes his own audience and his own voice, and in the process, Freddie Highmore -whose Peter is far more fascinating than his Charlie Becket- reconciles with his childhood while still understanding the adult world, he found 'Nerverland'. And while ""Finding Neverland"" could have ended in that triumphant note, it actually has a deeper respect for life and finds a note that is unexpectedly sad and poignant. Had the adult aligned with the child's mind, we'd have an ordinary coming-of-age conclusion, now, the opposite is more interesting.<br/><br/>Indeed, the ending shows the edge adults have on children: adulthood is a mystery for kids, but adults know what childhood is about, it is their role to help them reach that important phase of life, and that's what Barrie is determined to accomplish. Meanwhile he can also ask the grown-ups to slow down the growing process and have fun now and then. Who said Peter Pan's syndrome had to be permanent? Shouldn't we all find our Neverland sometime, somewhere?"
"zkonedog","9","1","1","3 March 2017"," The Magic Of ""Pan""
","The magic of the ""Peter Pan universe"" is something that most children experience at some time in their lives. The thrill of staying young forever, flying away to distant lands, and battling pirates is one that can easily capture the imagination of the young. ""Finding Neverland"" is the story of how James Barrie created that magical universe that has stood the test of time.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Finding Neverland"" sees struggling playwright James Barrie (Johnny Depp) introduced to Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet), a widow with four young children, on a chance encounter at a local park. While forming a bond with Sylvia and especially her playful children, Barrie begins to realize the power of ""play"" and ""imagination"" and begins to incorporate those elements into a new play about a boy who never grows up.<br/><br/>This film is very successful on two different levels:<br/><br/>1. The backstory on Barrie/Davies is very interesting. I knew nothing about it going in, so I can't speak to the accuracy of all the events depicted, but it sure seems as if Barrie was truly inspired by the Davies children.<br/><br/>2. For fans of the Peter Pan narrative, seeing the story come together bit by bit is a visual and emotional treat. It is kind of strange to think of the Pan story as anything but pure childhood escapism fiction, but this movie shows us how it was quite real to the actors, theater-goers, and producers of the day.<br/><br/>Only helping matters is the solid acting by Depp and Winslet, who are both so ""classically trained"" in acting (I believe they have both done much theater) that their casting is perfect in this period piece.<br/><br/>Overall, then, ""Finding Neverland"" is a fun, informative film for fans of the Peter Pan cannon. It will bring out your emotions, humor, and sense of history while viewing."

","Don't like it at all. I think the final scenes can summarize the whole story and be clear even if i didn't watch the movie from the beginning. <br/><br/>the final scenes are enough for you to know that the ""neverland"" is your ""imagined heaven"". <br/><br/>it wasn't interesting at all but the performance of Jony Deep, Kate Winslet and Freedie Highmore are very good, clear and satisfactory.<br/><br/>but I agree with the point of inspiration story as i very much believe in human relationships-not necessarily a husband-wife one- and to what extent they can affect your life, your progress if you were really involved, attached and committed to them."

","The secret to the success of ""Peter Pan"" lies in its ability to tap into the imaginations of its audience. That the film ""Finding Neverland"" manages to do the same thing is a remarkable achievement.<br/><br/>J. M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) is a soft-spoken, imaginative man with a childlike tendency to indulge in whimsy. He endures his strained marriage--and the other realities of life--by immersing himself in playwrighting. When he meets a widow (Kate Winslet) and her four boys, he involves himself in their lives, ignoring social mores.<br/><br/>Inspired by his foster family, Barrie begins to write the play ""Peter Pan"". The film manages to cross back and forth over the line between reality and fantasy, mirroring Barrie's view of life. It is a wonderful accomplishment, achieved in no small part by the film's beautiful score. The actors uniformly turn in solid performances. Overall, the production values are excellent and London of 1903 comes to life on screen. This film has a gentle soul and will appeal to anyone who understands the heart of Pan, the boy."
"melissarosemarsh","4","1","1","31 December 2013"," Not true to life
","Finding Neverland is an interesting film, Johnny Depp does a credible job in playing J.M. Barrie, his 'lost boy' interpretation is most apt and pleasing. However only in a few small places is the film true to life, to start with the FIVE Llewelyn Davies boys' father Arthur was alive when Barrie first came into their life and when Peter Pan was first performed. Peter Pan was first performed in 1904, Arthur died in 1907, Sylvia died in 1910 and the book Peter and Wendy was published in 1911.<br/><br/>The film is very well done, however, do not be fooled this is not the story of J.M.Barrie, read Andrew Birkin's biography for a slightly better idea of the real Barrie."
"MartinHafer","7","1","1","9 January 2013"," Charming and creepy....a strange combination.
","creepy--especially when seen today treated own wife horribly--very selfish Barrie was VERY successful before Peter Pan Like most bio-pics, ""Finding Neverland"" plays a bit fast and loose with the facts in order to build a better story. Now this film is NOT completely made up but if you study about J.M. Barrie's life, you'll see it does differ quite a bit from the film. For example, Barrie knew Mr. AND Mrs. Davies quite well and they lived much longer than they did in the movie. Additionally, you'd get the impression that Barrie was a failure as an author before he created Peter Pan, but he was highly successful and well thought of before Pan. But, to make a greater sense of tension, the film changed the facts here and there. So, as you watch, keep this in mind.<br/><br/>The film begins with Barrie's (Johnny Depp) most recent play flopping. At about the same time, he meets a young widow, Mrs. Davies (Kate Winslet), and her young sons at the park and befriends them--particularly the boys. They become playmates (which is pretty creepy if you think about it) and they behave almost like a family--which is really bad for Mrs. Barrie--who is left at home to fend for herself. Not surprisingly, people begin to talk--both about him spending time with a woman other than his wife as well as his preference to spending his time with young boys. Considering our present sensibilities, this isn't at all surprising that people would talk and that the Barrie marriage would crumble. Much of the rest of the film concerns his production of the play ""Peter Pan"" as well as the decline of Mrs. Davies and future of her sons.<br/><br/>If you completely divorce this film from reality and simply enjoy it for what it is, then you'll most likely enjoy the film very, very much. The acting is quite nice, as are the costumes, sets and music. The writing, though not always accurate, was also very good because it really stirs up a lot of feelings in the viewer--and as a result, it's enjoyable throughout. It's a shame they didn't trust the complete and true story, though, and that's why I give this very high quality production a score of only 7."
"leahr916","8","1","1","25 July 2005"," Great film - OK ending
","This is a terrific film. In a time when Hollywood makes just utter garbage films, this stood out and made me laugh, cry, and think. Johnny Depp is extremely good and so are the children. Biggest flaw was the ending. It's not enough that people die and go to a fictitious 'Neverland'. All of us must continue to search for what lies ahead after death. Do heaven and hell exist? This is always avoided in cinema and that's a cop out. Nevertheless, terrific film and one that is outside of Hollywood's horrible movies these days. Other great films in search of the hereafter are 'Ben Hur', 'Million dollar Baby', 'Field of Dreams', etc. In all, I think 'Finding NEverland' will hold a place in history, but it still lacked the substantive depth of what happens when we die."

","Dreams, imagination, freedom, enthusiasm, peace with yourself! This is how I would describe ""Finding Neverland"" after seeing it. It proved me once again that beauty stays in the eye of the beholder, meaning that one story is a different story once you allow yourself to look at it from another point of view. The movie shows us where the creator of Petre Pan got his inspiration from. And does it in a beautiful way. I was not a fan of the Peter Pan story, but now I do want to see it again so I can pay more attention to the details. Although this movie made a positive impression on me and reminded me of the fact that we should live every minute the way it makes us happy, it failed to stick with me for more than a second. And I think that happened because it's all just too perfect in the way things happen and that makes it full of clichés. All in all, it's a good movie that deserves to be seen for the revealing insights on the story of Peter Pan and for the nice feeling that it creates."
"Boggman","2","7","18","10 June 2005"," Yaaaaaaaaawn!! Finding Boringland.......
","I watched this film last night and can not figure out, for the life of me, what all the ""hype"" is about. Yes, we all love Johnny Depp, and many will say the same about Kate Winslet as well. However, not even these two talented performers can save this ""clunker"" from being the dreadful bore that it is.<br/><br/>J.M. Barrie (Depp) is a London playwright in 1903. While writing in the park as he often does, he happens to stumble across Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Winslet) and her four children. Immediately taking a liking to them, he begins a relationship with the troop, which in return, gives him the inspiration to write ""Peter Pan"".<br/><br/>First of all, does anyone really care? The character of J.M. Barrie for a full length feature film, just doesn't hold up. What is the surprise that a writer, while running around with 4 boys all day playing Cowboys and Indians, wouldn't start to get some kind of creative juice flowing? Doesn't take a genius to figure that out!! I found it very odd that J.M. Barrie was a married man, yet he spent all his free time running around with a widows children that aren't even his own? Barrie never even develops a romance with Davies, he simply plays with her kids all day long. Yet he refuses to introduce his wife to the family, nor involve her in any of his imaginative ""play dates"". It's almost as if he is having a love affair with these children, but not with their mother. If someone were to do that by today's standards, people would be in an uproar.<br/><br/>I side with Davies mother Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie), who thinks the whole ordeal is outlandish, and that Barrie should back off, letting Davies (a widow) and the children, move on with their life. After all, he is a married & successful playwright, with a life of his own. Of course, the children have become completely attached to Barrie, not realizing that when his writing is all said and done, the relationship with Barrie is more than likely to dissipate.<br/><br/>Well, that's not what happens, due to the fact that Davies has a secret illness (the cause never revealed) that will eventually take her own life. She starts out with a little cough here and there, then suddenly becomes too weak to leave the house and then....well you can guess the rest. It all happens rather quickly, without even a good explanation to the cause of her illness in the first place.<br/><br/>Summed up in a nutshell: Man meets kids, man plays with kids, man enjoys spending time with surrogate family more than own wife, man writes play, wife leaves husband, play becomes timeless classic, children's' mother dies, man gets joint custody of kids.<br/><br/>ZZZZZZZZZZZ!! I found the entire movie to be pretty boring. A romance with Winslet is never developed, although at times it is hinted that Depp has really fallen for her. However, they never even kiss in the film, so it is all speculation really. The children in the film are like any children by todays standards; creative, spunky and full of energy. One is named Peter, and of course, Peter and Barrie have the strongest bond with each other.<br/><br/>I feel that despite the two talented leads, this movie has nothing to offer really. The relationship amongst all the characters is presented in incomplete fashion throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>The story of J.M. Barrie's creative inspiration for writing Peter Pan is really not that interesting, entertaining, or moving enough to sit through for 106 minutes.<br/><br/>I balk at the fact this movie was nominated for an Academy Award for best picture and would suggest anyone interested in this dribble just pick up a copy of ""Peter Pan"" (written or filmed) instead! The story of Peter Pan is far more interesting than the story of the man who wrote it."
"twistoffate38","3","6","15","28 January 2005"," An Education Film, but Ultimately Overrated and Boring at Times
","I'm a bit baffled as to why this film is so popular with critics. It's not really connecting with mainstream audiences and didn't really work for me. My largest complaint about the film is that it is a bit slow and boring. Don't take your kids to it, expecting to see ""Peter Pan."" This is an adults film only. FINDING NEVERLAND is not a horrible film, either. It's educational in the sense that it brings to viewer back 100 years in time to a different era. Those that are ""Peter Pan"" fans may be interested in learning how the play was written. Overall, the performances were a bit lackluster, although Depp does his best.<br/><br/>Another major problem for me is that I had a lot of trouble sympathizing for Barre (Deppe). From the first scene in the film, it is made clear that he doesn't care much for his wife and his only true love is the young boys in the film. I also find it disturbing that Barre was alleged to be a child molester, an issue that the film just glazes over. Like Michael Jackson, we have no concrete proof of this, but I would not have wanted to leave my kids alone with Barre anymore than sending them to the ""Neverland Ranch."""

They should have been true to Barrie and at least had an actor of the correct stature play him...i.e 4foot 10 inches! Barrie suffered from psychogenic dwarfism.<br/><br/>What's more there is definitely an issue to address about a grown man wanting to spend so much time with somebody else's children...an issue that has been addressed in literature and documentaries about Barrie, but why not here?"
"fedor8","Null","5","12","2 October 2007"," Did Michael Jackson secretly finance this?
","Speak up!<br/><br/>I wish some of the cast would have mumbled less, especially since some of them were doing accents other than their own. Do I have to crank up the volume as if on a metal concert in order to understand some of the lines? Whispering in movies is annoying, but unfortunately an increasing problem.<br/><br/>But it's not the major problem here. FN is mostly manipulative schmaltz that Hollywood has served its sheepy audiences for nearly 100 years. Predictable every step of the way, which is unfortunate because the acting and the production values are good overall. At first I saw this as a typical family picture, but eventually realized it's tailor-made for women i.e. a typical syrupy chick-flick hence the movie's hysterically absurd high IMDb rating. Winslet dying young? But of course. Forget Princess Diana's tear-jerker funeral, get your handkerchiefs out for Winslet's overly melodramatic death. Based on true events, my butt.<br/><br/>Having a main character die from a sudden illness while falling in love - especially when young - is one of the oldest clichés in the movie book, and shows a lack of imagination, which is ironic because one of this movie's main themes is having and maintaining imagination. If only the writers of this script had listened to their own credo, this might have been a more original and better movie.<br/><br/>There are some dull moments as well, but these are mostly in the first half. At first I welcomed the fact that the four boys do not talk and behave like adults, but even this didn't last for the duration, because toward the end two of the boys started expressing themselves far too eloquently and intelligently for their respective age, which Depp ""rewarded"" by telling the oldest Winslet son that he has become a man. Handkerchiefs! Why do film-makers assume that only intelligent (or super-intelligent) children deserve our sympathy? That's quite a bit of elitist thinking, when one thinks about it, especially for Hollywood's liberals who pretend to always side with the weak.<br/><br/>I also find the casting of old people an increasing problem in Hollywood. Julie Christie's face looks very unnatural, due to weekly face-lifts, hence she comes off as a grotesque alien instead of as a woman that could be Winslet's mother. As an alien she can only lay eggs, and not give birth to beautiful women.<br/><br/>Winslet looks great, as always, but she doesn't try very hard. A scene early on in which she says that she can't imagine how horrible it must be for kids to lose a mother is a good example of her laziness.<br/><br/>Another problem with the movie is its typically Hollywoodesque twisting of the truth. I would have had no problems had they changed the names of all the characters at least. But they didn't. The writer of ""Peter Pan"" was most probably a pedophile, and TWO of the boys committed suicide in real life. Wow! What a great ""dad"" Barrie must have been!<br/><br/>I guess Michael Jackson's pedophilia and his obsession with Neverland and the androgynous Peter Pan character must be in some way related to all this, but I just can't seem to figure out in what way...<br/><br/>The next time MJ makes an appearance in court, being accused yet again of molesting little boys, his lawyers should play this movie to the jury to end the trial in two hours, hence save everyone the expenses of another sham of a celebrity trial.<br/><br/>For a little bit of satire: http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/johnny_depp__a_biography"

","The world of imagination as created by Sir James Matthew Barrie is solidly entrenched in both children books and in films such as ""Finding Neverland."" Viewing the superb acting talents of Johnny Depp, portraying the 19th century English writer J. M. Berrie, is tantamount to watching a great artist at work. The film laces Barrie's life before, during and after meeting his wife Kate Winslet, with the Victorian views of the day. What is glossed over or at the very least dissipated by the delicate film are the circulating rumors, societal suspicions and vicious gossip regarding Mr. Barries' real reason for marrying the matron widow and her attractive family. The film proves witty, incisive and stocked with family values seldom found in other movies. Anyone seeking a glimpse of turn-of-the-century England will enjoy Depp's performance as he reveals the inspirational origins for his memorable story of Peter Pan. **"

","Although this review contains no real spoilers, I will mark this as having some to be on the safe side. But I bet you know the tale already, it is after all about ""Peter Pan."" This is a movie of loss and gain; of boys that grow up too fast, and boys that never grow old; of wonder and cynicism; happy and sad. It's all that at the same time. It's excellent, and probably Depp's best role to date.<br/><br/>I felt sorry for what happened to the characters, I worried, and I was happy when the children ""found themselves again."" I'm not sure how truly accurate the film is, but that doesn't matter: it is a film, and some suspension of belief is needed; and they never said this was a biopic.<br/><br/>It isn't often that a film like this comes about. They're rare, like trips to Neverland by an adult, something to be cherished.<br/><br/>Having said all that, this is still not a ""perfect"" movie, the flaw is that I don't believe this will withstand multiple viewings, but I could be wrong. Pathos aside, this is a good film, excellent even; but not worthy of too high a rating. It would be a disservice to rate this too highly, and equally so too low; so I have to give it a nice, round, ""6"" out of ""10."" Still, you should see this. It's worth the price of admission."

","I can't quite put my finger on it why, but this movie feels moderately executed. One of the few things that feel genuine is the representation of the era (costumes, production design). What also draws one's attention is the crafted performance of Johnny Depp and the surprisingly natural performance of Freddie Highmore. Along with the powerful last scene of the film, these are what ""Finding Neverland"" has to offer in my opinion.<br/><br/>I found the direction somewhat poorly paced, without a sense of rhythm, not at all helped by the not-so-skilled editing. Photography also gave me a bad impression, when the actors' faces were shadowed and obscure in closed sets. As for the rest of the performances, Dustin Hoffman was totally in the background, Julie Christie and Radha Mitchell were (again, in my opinion) bad, and even Kate Winslet didn't seem to have seethed her teeth into her role (especially in comparison with her wonderful work in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"").<br/><br/>Apparently, the film has a message to deliver, about the Neverland in each and every one of us, about growing up and mature but still remaining a kid etc. It's clearly up to the viewer, how much he will yield to that message and subsequently to the magic of the movie. I admit I wasn't all that carried away. The message of ""Finding Neverland"" is unfortunately contained in a poor package."
"Seshet","3","5","13","9 July 2005"," Dedicated performances can't turn this one around
","MINOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>Unfortunately, neither Johnny Depp's great talent nor the dedication of each and every actor and actress in this film prevent it from becoming sticky, sentimental, and slickly packaged. The one credit I'll give this film up front is that it tells the public that Barrie was not a pedophile. This is happy news for those of us who believe he wasn't. However, the film fails in three major ways, only one of which is related to historical accuracy. 1. Let's get the historical notes out of the way first. Certainly this film is not intended to be a biopic, and I think the film makers were fairly clear about this. That said, as any kind of portrayal of J. M. Barrie, the film certainly fails, for there are so many glaring inaccuracies in it that one really can't say it's about J. M. Barrie; it doesn't make sense to waste the space listing all of the reasons why. Pick up a copy of A. Birkin's biography of Barrie, ""J. M. Barrie and the Lost Boys,"" to see what I'm talking about. Birkin combines Barrie's notes, letters, and photographs with the correspondence and photographs of others, as well as with historical facts, to give a picture of who Barrie really was and how his relationships with the Davies family worked. It's a fascinating read.<br/><br/>2. Even if one moves beyond the historical faults of Finding Neverland, the film fails also as an exploration of what would compel an individual, particularly the main character of Finding Neverland, to create a work like Peter Pan. The problem, I think, is that the film portrays the Peter Pan story as a jolly little tale by a jolly little man. I'll agree with a healthy amount of literary criticism here: My own reading of the Peter Pan play, novel, prequel (Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens), and Barrie's early movie treatment reveal to me a story that is tremendously entertaining but also tremendously terrifying.<br/><br/>Barrie's ""terrifying masterpiece,"" as Peter Davies so well termed it, is permeated with anxiety. Most people recognize its well-known anxiety about growing up, but you don't have to peel back many layers of the play or novel to see conflicts between the Victorian ideal of the virtuous Mother and the fact that mothers have sex to become mothers. Both the play and novel also express anxiety about gender and gender roles, sexuality, unfulfilled desire, abandonment, death, and confusion over self-identity.<br/><br/>So it's difficult to believe that the playful, dapper man that the screenplay and Depp give us, despite the difficulties in his life, could create a work as troubling as Peter Pan. In fact, that sort of man didn't create Peter Pan. The man who created Peter Pan was extraordinarily imaginative but also conflicted, anxious, and really quite grim. He was a man who wanted not only to be a boy but even more so to be a mother of boys. This isn't very palatable to the movie-going public, but it's a more credible personality for the creator of Peter Pan.<br/><br/>Because the film simplifies both the Peter Pan play and Barrie himself, it doesn't create a believable picture of what type of person could create Peter Pan.<br/><br/>3. Thus, the best way to take this film is as an exploration of the creative process. In this respect the film draws some decent connections between its ""Barrie,"" his life, and his work. Thus my three stars. However, the script is so contrived, so formulated to draw tears and laughs from the audience, that it either distracts one from, or lessens the impact of, this exploration. And because the film contains so many inaccuracies, we can't get the clearer, and more colorful, picture of how Barrie took the events and people from his life to create Peter Pan.<br/><br/>Ironically, if this film had stuck to history, or had at least given its ""Barrie"" and his creation more complexity, the resulting story would have been much more poignant without the need for a formulated script. The historical Barrie's involvement with Mr. and Mrs. Davies and their children is a powerful, moving, and often very sad tale of love, loss, conflict, and creation. It's lamentable that this film couldn't keep pace with the true story."
"BertEmke","5","4","10","17 December 2004"," Disappointing
","I cannot understand how this predictable and emotionally manipulative movie can be nominated for even a single Golden Globe award, much less five. The acting is pedestrian, and the story contrived. Even the visually interesting fantasy scenes don't quite fit. Whose imagination is supposed to be at work here -- James Barrie's, the boys', or ours in the movie audience?<br/><br/>The phoniness of the acting is apparent when you compare the final scene, with Johnny Depp as Barrie and Freddie Highmore as Peter sharing their sorrow, with the far more honest and powerful display of grief by Anthony Hopkins and Joseph Mazzello in ""Shadowlands.""<br/><br/>And why was Depp cast in the Barrie role to begin with? His Scottish accent is unconvincing and annoying, and his range of facial expressions more limited than a resident of Madame Tussauds. I guess he got the leading role for the same reason Dustin Hoffman shows up as Barrie's financial backer: to give the movie a bit of extra heft at the box office. <br/><br/>Surely there are dozens of actors in Britain who could have done a better job than either of them -- and who could use the work."

The subtleties that he carries out in order to depict Barrie is just amazing. I thought that his accent was right on cue as well. The boys were all marvelous.

That was truly a very innocent scene.

"loupe2","7","2","4","10 February 2005"," Not exactly the true story of J M Barry and the Davis family
","This sounds like a wonderful movie, which I want to see, but what it isn't is the true story of JM Barrie. <br/><br/>From reading others comments its obvious that there is many inaccuracies in the film regarding the true nature of the relationship between JM Barrie and the Davis family.<br/><br/>Firstly when Barrie met the family, the father was still alive, and according to letters written by both the father and the mother, his interest was not particularly welcomed. This is documented in a biography of Barrie, published about 10 years ago. According to this version, the Davises found his obsession with the boys and constant attempts to put himself in the family's inner circle intrusive and pitiable.<br/><br/>However when the father was struck down with a particularly nasty facial cancer, causing him to be hospitalized, his jawbone to be removed,and eventually killing him, Barrie seized on the opportunity to prove his devotion to the family, visiting him in hospital and taking it upon himself to be a protector to Sylvia and boys, much to everyones dismay. After her husband's death, If I remember correctly Sylvia and Barrie did marry in the end, but only because he hounded her persistently and having no other means, Sylia needed his help financially. I think this would have made an interesting picture, but obviously not the ""touching and heartwarming"" tear jerker described in these pages. Don't get me wrong, I think fictionalizing the truth often does make for a better story, but what I find annoying is when people believe something as the literal truth, because they saw it in a movie. Movies about historical events and real people should serve as springboard for those that are interested to dig a bit deeper and find the true story for themselves."
"stamper","8","2","4","10 December 2004"," Imagining Neverland
","Finding Neverland is a film that relies as much imagination in the viewer as does J.M. Barrie's classic tale Peter Pan itself, if not more, since we are basically told to believe what we have seen is real. The critical viewer will certainly know that he must not take the 'Inspired by a true story' so serious as to believe that everything that happened in the film did happen in reality, but besides some minor points the film manages to be quite believable. I must warn though, that some people, who do not like the fantasy genre might not like this movie, since there are some 'imaginative' scenes in it. I myself (a huge fan of Star Wars and the like) must admit that I struggled with the element of fantasy in this film the first time it was introduced. As the movie preceded though, I got sucked into an imaginative state and I got carried away by the magic of the film.<br/><br/>Now it might seem that everything in this film is magic and sweet, but there is also some drama and some harsh reality in this film, which makes it a somewhat extraordinary mix of a film. Some elements are really childlike and could be passed off as a film for kids up to 14 or so, while other themes (especially in the ending) will not be of interest or might not be suitable for some children up to that age. I could relate very good to the adult as well as to the immature (childish) themes of the movie and therefore enjoyed the movie very much. Some might argue that the film is overly sweet and sentimental, but I didn't feel that way. Sure the ending is somewhat sentimental, but it is not soap-opera sentimental and I did not feel that the director tried to milk out every possible tear in the audience by extending every scene in the end beyond what was necessary to convey it's last message. I mean after seeing this it is obvious that at least one scene could have been much longer ;) (not spoiling things here I hope)!!! I don't know what else to say about this film, except that I felt that it was a success on all fronts. The directing was good (I thought Mr.Forster did a better job on this one that he did on Monsters Ball), the music was good and the acting was just great! Johnny Depp was good as ever, although I felt that he was better in last year's Pirates of The Caribbean (probably due to the fact that the latter had a weaker cast overall). I still think he deserves an Oscar nod though. What to say about Kate Winslet then (despite mentioning (again) that I have a thing for her)??? I thought she was good as well, although I felt that she had a lot more character development in The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and that she should win the Oscar for that latter performance. As far as the rest of the actors are concerned, they all did a good job except for one: Freddie Highmore!!! Yes, you got that right. The boy that played Peter. He completely blew me away. I mean Í sort of expected good acting (since Winslet, Depp and Hoffman were cast) but I never expected this little fellow to be as great as he was. The new Osment? Well, no! I hate that sort of comments. But definitely a promising young actor and I'll look forward to seeing him with Depp again in Charlie and the chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 <br/><br/>post scriptum: I guess Hoffman will get an Oscar nod, he deserves it"
"MJM5226","Null","2","4","30 November 2004"," J.M. Barrie gets Disneyized (*SPOILERS*)
","I finally saw this movie yesterday, after nearly a year of waiting on tenterhooks for it to come out. I went into the theatre with 3 mindsets: Watching for entertainment value, for film-making value, and for historical (in)accuracy.<br/><br/>And I am sad to report that I was quite disappointed on all 3 fronts. :-P<br/><br/>There's not much left to say about the historical inaccuracies. They do make it clear before the ""action"" begins by flashing a big ""Inspired By True Events"" disclaimer up on the screen. But those ""true events"" are quite few and far between. Yes, there was a Scottish bloke named J.M. Barrie who wrote 'Peter Pan'. Yes, he knew a woman named Sylvia and her sons. Yes, he was married to a woman named Mary who later left him. That's about as accurate as this film gets. If I list all the events in this film as compared to what REALLY happened, we'll be here all day. But perhaps it was more of a handicap on my part to be so infinitely familiar with Barrie's life story, which is why I tried to relegate that stuff to my subconscious as much as possible.<br/><br/>The issues of entertainment value and film-making kinda go hand-in-hand. On the whole, this film was verrrryyyy awkwardly and slowly paced and disjointed. It was even downright BORING in several spots. It was as if this film did not know what it was trying to say, and therefore I had no idea what it was trying to say either! Was it an homage to a great writer and his genius? Or was it an homage to the spirit of Peter Pan and Neverland? It was neither, sadly. It was mass confusion, is what it was.<br/><br/>One of the biggest Rule-of-Thumbs which they teach you in theatre and film is this: If you introduce a convention, you MUST stick with it and be consistent! 'FN' introduced a convention of trying to blend fantasy with real life, but it did not quite work and it was not utilized enough to make it convincing. It seemed almost hacky. It was not until the end when I saw the movie become what I had so hoped for it -----<br/><br/>Because Sylvia is sick and missed opening night of 'Peter Pan', JMB (who had promised to take her to Neverland one day) brings 'Peter Pan' to her  installing some crude set pieces and actors from the actual show into her drawing room. After Peter Pan stands before the Davies family and entreats of them to clap for Tinker Bell (which they do, of course), the back wall behind Peter lifts away and reveals a fantastic Neverlandscape before them all, filled with fairies, Indians, pirates, and all sorts of animals prancing merrily about. JMB leans in toward Sylvia's ear and whispers 'That is Neverland.' At this point, you are not sure whether this is real (that JMB has somehow turned the Davies front yard into a fantasy playground) or if it is all in their imagination; that JMB has at last led them all to 'find Neverland.' THIS is what the WHOLE movie should have been, IMO. As an homage to both Barrie and the spirit of Peter Pan, the movie would have been so much more effective if it had blurred the lines between fantasy and reality much, much more (something Barrie was brilliant at doing). Yes, there are the few scenes where Barrie is playing with the boys and we are treated to a mish-mash of jump cuts from Real Life and the Fantasy World they have created, but these interludes were (a) too few, and (b) not effective in the way they kept reminding you that it was NOT real. That's not only an insult to the audience's intelligence, but it also isn't HALF as fun! ;-)<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, I will be frank ---- screw Johnny Depp, and screw Kate Winslet and all the others....Freddie Highmore (Peter Davies) is the ONLY one who should be getting Oscar buzz. This little kid was PHENOMENAL!! He blew all those other 'veterans' completely out of the water. It's worth it to see the film just for him alone.<br/><br/>It was also perhaps to my disadvantage (although I don't like to think of it so) that the day before seeing 'FN', I had watched the entire 3 parts of the 1978 BBC miniseries 'The Lost Boys', another JMB biopic where Barrie is played by Ian Holm and based on Andrew Birkin's biography of him. And I tell ya, this film was the book brought to life EXACTLY! Everything was Excruciatingly accurate, and the actors all embodied their characters so perfectly that I really thought I was watching a documentary! And after it was all over, I thought to myself 'How can I POSSIBLY go and watch 'Finding Neverland' now??' LOL! Well, I did anyway, and IMO, 'TLB' was lightyears more superior to 'FN' in every way. If you have the means to get your hands on this series, PLEASE DO! It is to 'Finding Neverland' what P.J. Hogan's 'Peter Pan' is to Disney's 'Peter Pan'! ;-D"

","Disclaimer: I 'd go to the movies just to watch Johnny Depp walk across the<br/><br/>street, so I'm certain that has colored my impressions of this film.<br/><br/>That being said, Depp does a lot more here than walk across the street,<br/><br/>although I think he should have had better writing to work with for his efforts. The story is compelling, the characters are complex and the setting -- early 20th century U.K. -- makes for great visuals (ball gowns, rustic country cottages, early cars and Victorian furnishings), but there is something that just falls short about this movie and I believe it is the writing. As a filmmaker, Forster is gifted and imaginative, which makes him well suited for the director's job on this film. His choice of folding in a play within the story of the movie was a good move. Yet it is ultimately the story path that becomes a problem -- one that wasn't helped by the less-than brilliant dialogue -- and that can be laid at the feet of both the writer and the film's editor. My complaint is that the story just doesn't hang together. In an attempt, perhaps, to elevate the James/Sylvia relationship to a higher plane, the movie merely makes it confused. Sexual tension is played<br/><br/>down, the overbearing mother role is way too played up and Barrie's poor<br/><br/>confused, lonely wife nibbles at the edges of a relationship that doesn't quite have a form. <br/><br/>The relationships in this film are complex and integrated, but yet the writers seem incapable of crafting a script that conveys how they are entwined. There is little exploration of Sylvia's past or how her losses affected her, not just her children. Barrie's marriage and wife are enigmatic to an extreme.<br/><br/>Despite all this, if I had a vote for best actor in next year's academy awards, Depp would get it. What an extraordinary actor. It is wonderful to watch him<br/><br/>work. And walk across the street."

(PG)<br/><br/>Genteel account of playwright J.M. Barrie (Depp), stranded in a rather aloof and loveless marriage, forming a deep friendship with a widow (Winslet) and her four boys; his relationship with the children goes on to inspire his most famous creation of Peter Pan, the boy who could fly. Treated less as a biopic or historical drama than a fantasy of the imagination (just as well, since many liberties are taken with the facts, and the more ungainly rumors/suspicions are entirely ignored), with the real and unreal interwoven during performance/reading flights of fancy. Tender and poignant, it may lack an especially compelling narrative but makes do with understated charm, humor and sadness. Hoffman provides a dry but droll counterpoint to Depp's irrepressible eccentricities; Christie is on hand to provide some semblance of a villain, but the matter is wisely underplayed and sacrificed by the conclusion. The imagined action can be a bit underwhelming at times, but the design of the pirate ship sequence on the high seas is a delight.<br/><br/>73/100"

The whispered performances detracted from the overall experience. Do actors *really* have to whisper and mumble their way through the script? Listen carefully and you can hear the dubbing mixer's ""noise gates"" working flat out. Whenever anyone speaks in the intimate whispered passages, you can hear the background mush behind their tiny voice, which has to be cranked up to maximum in order to hear what they're saying. Then the moment they stop speaking, the noise gate cuts in and the background goes eerily silent until the next line starts. Distracting at best. Otherwise, a great film."

","Finding Neverland is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is a ridiculously sweet movie as we follow the life of real author JM Barrie, discovering how a close bond with a family inspired him to create Peter Pan. As we see his relationship with these people develop over the course of the movie we can really feel a real bond, it is written in a way that makes it so life like and believable, towards the end, getting quite heart wrenching. <br/><br/>It was a little bit too heartwarming at times to a degree that it felt cheesy. Every scene, every piece of dialogue from the characters is very abrupt and honest, but this can feel somewhat forced when it's so frequent. People are not honest all the time, people do not speak the truth, its interesting when we have a character saying one thing, but learn from paying attention to the development of the character that he means something else, but in Neverland, everyone seems to say exactly what they are thinking.<br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal, Dustin Hoffman shines in a small, but noticeable role, Kate Winslet is immensely effective as the struggling mother, and all the child actors are excellent young performers. Johnny Depp is, of course, the highlight as Barrie, playing a role a lot more toned down and normal in comparison to his usual Tim Burton-esque flamboyant characters, he is subtle, quiet and delivers a meaningful performance of a passionate writer and playwright, as well as an impressive Scottish accent. <br/><br/>Entertaining, with a very sweet message.

","How did this sneak under my radar?.. A wonderful film-ideally suited for a wet Sunday afternoon-warm and tender, but bitter-sweet, melancholic, and even bleak in places... A marvellous tour-de-force performance from Johnny Depp (he's never been better)-some might say he is a little young (the author/playwright was 44 years old when his play was first staged), but Barrie was an innocent, and always young-at-heart... Perhaps his trademark soup-strainer might have given Depp more gravitas... And with a wonderfully understated yet convincing Scottish accent as well (Hollywood, take note), Depp once again proves himself to be simply the best young leading man Hollywood has to offer-in fact, we're also treated to what I believe to be a prototype Jack Sparrow, as, although this was released after 'Pirates of the Caribbean', it was filmed before... He is ably supported by Kate Winslet, although I do think she could have worked harder on her diction, and a simply delicious turn from the delectable Julie Christie as the ogre-in-waiting, and the implied inspiration for the future Captain Hook.<br/><br/>Much like when reading the book that Barrie wrote after his play's success, 'Wendy and Peter' (and even it's woeful sequel, 'Peter Pan in Scarlet'), this is a work best enjoyed by suspending one's disbelief. The film is punctuated by imaginary vignettes, which would eventually coalesce into the play 'Peter Pan, or, The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up'. It's a fascinating re-thinking of exactly how Barrie's Chef d'Oeuvre came to be, albeit with some tactical artistic interpretation of dates and facts (there were no 25 orphans attending the premiere, but it still raised a lump to my throat). The four brothers (Freddie Highmore, Joe Prospero, Nick Roud and Luke Spill) all excel-their delivery can be stilted at times, but Highmore, particularly, is a revelation. Dustin Hoffman, effectively in a cameo role as Barrie's American backer, Charles Frohman, breezes through his performance in true veteran style, never breaking sweat, but I felt the ensemble cast was rather let down by Radha Mitchell, playing Mary Ansell, Barrie's wife-no engagement there at all... The supporting cast is sprinkled with familiar faces, all clearly enjoying themselves, the set-dressing, costumes and attention to detail all superb ...<br/><br/>So, altogether a magical film about a magical summer leading to the creation of a magical play (and book), which is still delighting audiences to this day. I was gladdened to read ""with enormous gratitude to GREAT ORMOND STREET HOSPITAL FOR CHILDREN"" (who, of course, still own the rights), in the credits, and hope they benefited hugely from this film.<br/><br/>Settle down with your children and grandchildren, a soothing drink, and a fire in the grate-for children from five to 95...

If asked about his personal life, could any of you come up with anything about him. So what happens here is a fictional account of the writer, making him a bit of an irresponsible boy (a lost boy?). While bouncing around with his writing and failing here and there, he one day come upon a widow and her four boys. Because children are so much to him, he begins to get to know the boys. His interactions help them (with one exception) diminish their sorrow over the death of their father. He also begins to befriend the young widow. The whole story is touching.

The movie features the legendary Julie Christie as Winslet's domineering mother, a woman of contradictions who certainly needs some magic of her own to lessen her inhibitions that are well meaning and understandable, not just some aging harridan who is unreasonably sour. It's a magical trip back in time too, giving a glimpse into a story re- told many times and reformatted in several different ways. Depp is fantastic in this, a film and musical I could watch or listen to over and over and never, never grow old from the magic it gives each time."

","Johnny Depp has reached a depth in interpreting a character that he was never able to reach again neither before or after this movie. With great elegance and with an ease, he reflects Barries mild eccentricity and distance to the community where he lived. What allows Depp in this movie to give a brilliant performance is also the team that interpreted the supporting roles. Kate Winslet which in each movie proves over and over again how brilliant as an actress she is, portrays the character to perfection. ''Finding Neverland'' appeals to the kid in all of us. The main message is that if you want enough and believe in something, it will come true.

","An elegantly crafted tale told with utmost sincerity, Finding Neverland is a heartfelt blend of the endless imagination, warmth & exuberant joy of childhood with soul-crushing hardships of real life that benefits a lot from the endearing performances its cast is able to chip in but lacks the wow factor that elevates any film from a 'good one' to a 'great one'.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland is a semi-autobiographical account of the Scottish playwright J.M.

The film focuses on his friendship with the Davies family and the time he spent with the Davies' kids from which he drew the inspiration for his next play, which would eventually go on to become a children classic.<br/><br/>Directed by Marc Forster, Finding Neverland skilfully incorporates the elements of fantasy into its simple-structured plot and has a very calm, serene-like vibe to it. Everything is in tune to make it a poignant experience for the viewers but it's the performances by Johnny Depp & Kate Winslet that contribute the most to that particular aspect and both of them are nicely supported by the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Finding Neverland is an intimate, touching piece of graceful storytelling which sometimes heads deeper into its melodrama than required but keeps the majority of its acts balanced to deliver a pleasantly satisfying experience. There isn't much wrong with its content but what it has in store for its viewers isn't something that stays around once its story is over.

When I first saw this movie i was only about 5 yrs old and I was mesmerized in a strange way I had the feeling of being an adult because it was easy to understand while most adult movies makes a child confused.

Depp shines in his role as Barrie and as an audience we go along with his actions, despite the fact that in a way he is cheating on his wife.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet is also on top form in her role, with her chemistry with Depp and the boys that play her children feels genuine and this is one of the main strengths of the film.<br/><br/>It's not the quickest film you'll ever see in terms of pace but that doesn't make the final moments any less touching or well written.

","After reading some other negative reviews I guess I'm fortunate that I had no real expectations and no preconceived notions or knowledge of the real history of J.M. Barrie. It came up free on streaming so I figured I'd give it a try. About half an hour in I admitted I wasn't invested in it, but I left it on so I could keep listening and went into the other room to peel up some sheet vinyl flooring (yes, really). At Winslet's first cough I said ""Dead by the finale"" usually I can't predict what's going to happen, and I had no idea that the real Mrs. Llewellyn had died, but as it turned out I was spot on. I finished my flooring project and returned for the last 10 minutes or so, and I didn't feel I needed to go back to see what I'd missed.<br/><br/>To be totally fair, I'm not a big fan of fantasy, so with one exception the scenes of the imagined Neverland were totally wasted on me. That exception was a simple scene where Mr. and Mrs. Barrie said their goodnights and went to their respective separate bedrooms off a common hallway Mrs. Barrie entered her real Victorian-era room, where Mr. Barrie entered a room that emitted bright colorful light around the edges of the door, almost like Dorothy Gale first stepping out into the Land of Oz. This hint that Barrie was living in a fantasy world that was very real to him was a nice touch, I thought, and I found it very clever. I'm glad I wasn't stripping linoleum during that scene; I wouldn't have appreciated it if I couldn't see it.<br/><br/>I'm not a Depp fan, although I thought he was terrific in ""Ed Wood"". He's fine here and seems to have a good handle on the accent. Winslet's role could have been played by any number of actresses and she really didn't bring that much to the part. Overall I'd say this was average; I might have rated it higher if I were more of a fantasy fan, or lower if I had more knowledge of Barrie's real life before viewing. Not my cup of tea."

Freddie Highmore and Johnny Depp have outlived their characters to transpire the experience of such journeys to the minds of viewers.<br/><br/>Over the years, 'objective' in literature, just like our lives, has grown so much that people have forgotten what fun and at times - 'education of wisdom' - is fantasizing. Based on the life of J.M. Barrie and on the events leading to his creation of Peter Pan, this film gently reminds us of the joy and the gifts of imagination.<br/><br/>However, an essential question arose around its middle - ""Why imagine good things, and dream for better when in reality all we'll receive is disdain and disappointment from life?"" The reason being - because life's hard, and indeed,'realism' is necessary and should transpire in our minds as we grow up; however, our hopes shall not fade away because in the end, what matters is that how honestly we trusted ourselves to make it less hard and more pleasant with our loved ones, with our work, and most essentially with 'ourselves'. Maybe that's what was tried to be emulated around the film's climax.<br/><br/>Marc Forster (Director; ""Stranger Than Fiction"", ""Quantum of Solace"") quite meticulously made this film into an ""imaginarium"" of sorts, where imagination was the motivation to hope and to be resilient. The screen writing by David Magee(Screenplay, ""Life of Pi"") was nothing less than ""enchanting"", and so was the film's editing by Matt Chesse, a frequent collaborator of Forster. The casting of the film was another plus; Kate Winslet playing the ailing mother was quite moving.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, in its crux the film talks of 'growing up' while speaking of ""the undying spirit of youth""... Maybe that's what maturing is and more so - growing wiser. To quote from another popular film... ""If its not good, its not the end""... And I would like to ""hope"" so."

Barrie's friendship with a family who inspired him to create Peter Pan.'<br/><br/>The vision of this film was great! It really captured the early 1900's. From the clothing to the sets, everything was spot on. The sets changing from fantasy to reality was great film-making! The imagination was easy to see and easy to relate to. The scene after the dinner sequence, when Johnny Depp and his wife slip through different doors, the sight of each open door is a real eye opener. Great editing! This film had great cinematography. Example was the kite scene as the camera acted as the kite and had a gorgeous god's eye view shot. Very creative. The quick shots throughout indicating Peter Pan references are fantastic, from the grandmother's hook to the boys flying through the window.<br/><br/>The story really hit me hard. Always believe. Never lose your inner child, great message and great writing. The origins of the 'Peter Pan' story was a great unfolding. It was like pulling a string of yarn from a ball, more and more gets revealed. The origin of 'Neverland' was phenomenal to experience. Really hits the heart. The story really shows that there can be such beauty and imagination in this world but there are also aspects that want to destroy it. The key is to keep believing.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore stole the show for me. My eyes were glued to him throughout the film. He is such a cute little boy with such a mature acting performance. He can be adorable when necessary but he could also bring a serious performance when necessary as well. Johnny Depp brought great enthusiasm to the screen. It seems like the mood and emotions of the film revolved around his performance. His scenes with Highmore are my particular favorites. Have to acknowledge Kate Winslet's performance as well. Always lovely to see her on screen and her terrific acting skills is just icing on a terrific cake. Not necessarily a deep role but it's a great performance the film needed and plays a big factor in the story telling of 'Peter Pan.'<br/><br/>The music from the beginning showed you what kind of film you were about to watch. Upbeat and happy. It was great. The high tunes and pitches captured you in. The quick violins and piano playing was a great touch. The music brings a smile to your face as much as the writing and actors do. It's perfect. I loved every note. But it doesn't necessarily tell you the whole story. This film has its emotional/serious scenes and the music doesn't skip a beat.Marvelous!<br/><br/>'Finding Neverland' was beautifully written and orchestrated. Every aspect of the film seemed to come together to bring such an innocent and heart-warming tale. I recommend watching this film and not only once. Try to take something away from this picture, whether its personal or film-making related. There are so many messages sent, it's impossible to only react to only one."

I think it tactfully teaches that marriage is to be taken seriously before one enters into the contract, and I think that that is an important message for our modern world. While the movie is child appropriate it isn't especially child friendly, unless they are precocious I think that they may very well bore of it; the movie is really more for adults.

","The story of Sir James M. Barrie's friendship with a family who inspired him to create Peter Pan.<br/><br/>I have a few quibbles with this film. First being it is not strictly accurate. I feel like the film tried to balance history with fun, but history got the short end of the stick too often. Barrie deserves a good biopic, and this just is not it. I am particularly referring to the absence of Arthur Davies -- his being gone makes Barrie seem even more scandalous than he probably was.<br/><br/>I also thought it was rather dull at first, though the second half was much improved. History does not have to be dull -- both ""King's Speech"" and ""Iron Lady"" are excellent films that present history. This film seemed almost devoid of history... when was it set? How did that impact the characters? It is not clear.<br/><br/>But I do not mean to be so harsh, as it actually was a rather good story. Seeing Julie Christie is a plus, and Dustin Hoffman never fails (his role is much too small). Kate Winslet did a more than adequate job, and Johnny Depp was... well, decent. (I find it hard to judge Depp because he has reached that level of stardom where it is easily to see him than it is to see the character he portrays)."

","I found that it took a while for this movie to really pick up steam. It seemed for a good while to be poorly structured and paced, with characters who weren't really hitting home with me. I was getting the connections. I understood that young Peter was going to be the inspiration for Peter Pan, or that Barrie's dog would have a role to play in the story, and I understood the significance of the game of cowboys and Indians. But still, somehow, this wasn't really hitting home with me. Then ... Sylvia got sick and couldn't go to opening night but the orphans showed up for the premiere of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. That's when this took off for me and became a very powerful and very touching movie.<br/><br/>It's the story of Scottish author and dramatist J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp), who is most famous for his creation of Peter Pan. It dramatizes the relationship he developed with young widow Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslow) and her four sons, who provide him with the inspiration for the story; who become, in a way, his ""muses.""<br/><br/>The story takes some licence, particularly in the relationship between Barrie and the Davies family. Barrie knew Arthur Davies (the boys' father and Sylvia's husband) long before he ever met Sylvia, for example, although the movie doesn't give that impression. So the relationship between Barrie and Sylvia is a bit misleading. (In real life, Barrie claimed that he and Sylvia were engaged to be married before she died; she never mentioned this to anyone or in her will.) It still makes for a powerfully touching concluding part of the movie, though, as Sylvia laments from her sickbed that she's never seen ""Neverland,"" and Barrie manages to stage a production of ""Peter Pan"" for her in her home. Sylvia's obvious awe at seeing the play does touch the emotions.<br/><br/>Depp and Winslet did well together. This was a more serious performance that we often see Depp in. I think his frequent partnership with director Tim Burton in often ""quirky"" movies can give the impression that he isn't really a ""serious"" actor. Teamed in this with director Marc Forster, Depp showed that he could handle a role with some depth to it.<br/><br/>I still struggled with the first half of this, though. And, although dramatic licence with a true story doesn't usually bother me, in this case I thought a little too much dramatic licence was taken. The only movie I can think of to compare this to might be the 2006 movie ""Miss Potter,"" the story of Beatrix Potter and how she developed the story of ""The Tale Of Peter Rabbit."" ""Miss Potter"" was better, although this turns out to be not bad. (6/10)"

Happens all the time: JFK, Schindler's List, Titanic, Mutiny on the Bounty (all 3 versions), The Sound of Music, etc., etc. Doesn't mean you can't just sit back, suspend disbelief, enjoy the movie and don't take it too seriously.<br/><br/>Yes, the original tale of Peter Pan has dark elements, but so do many children's stories. The world is a scary place and children know it all too well. But they also know the joy of imagination and playing; things that can get stifled as children grow up. I believe Barrie was trying to show us all that we didn't have to give up the things that keep us young at heart. That's what I got from this movie...for what it's worth.<br/><br/>A few reviewers have mentioned the possibility J.M. Barrie was a pedophile. Perhaps he was; haven't come across anything conclusive. Also, Victorians had a way of expressing affection that can be misinterpreted in the 21st century. The same has been said of Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland). He had many young ""girlfriends"" throughout his lifetime; he wrote what we these days would consider passionate letters to them. There was never any indication he had any sexual feelings (or acted on them).<br/><br/>Perhaps Barrie and Carroll were just more in tune with the minds of children."

","Sir James Barrie (Johnny Depp) is a well known playwright. This film is based on the true events that led to his greatest creation, Peter Pan. In the film, it seems Mr. Barrie has lost his flair for plays. During one of his daily visits to the park, he meets the Davies family, a widow, Silvia Lewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four sons. Mr. Barrie finds the motivation needed for his next play through his relationship with the Davies family, Peter Davies (Freddie Highmore) in particular.<br/><br/>This film shows the importance of not taking things to seriously; to take time to use your imagination to enjoy life and not be in a hurry to grow up. The relevance of one's imagination is apparent from the beginning of the film to its ending. The director, Marc Forster, uses motifs to demonstrate the imaginary scenes in various parts of the film. For example, as Mr. Barrie is watching the audience reaction to his play in the film's beginning, he sees rain falling inside the entire theater when in fact it is not. Another example is when Silvia's mother, Mrs. Emma Du Maurier (Julie Christie), is scolding the boys while holding a spoon in her hand. Mr. Barrie is watching and visualizes a hook in place of her hand and spoon.<br/><br/>Forster utilizes the indirect-subjective point of view to bring us into the lives of the characters and their imaginations. The camera angles and point of view make us feel as though we are standing right beside the characters. Equally important are the settings and costumes. We are fully transported back to 1903 where social status is very important and reflected in the costumes worn by the characters. The sound of the horse hooves and carriage wheels transporting people about the streets adds authenticity to the time period. All of the theses elements put us with the characters at the appropriate time in history.<br/><br/>The film Hook directed by Steven Spielberg also follows a similar theme to Finding Neverland. In Hook, Peter (Robin Williams) must find a way to use his imagination so he can fight Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) and save his children. The same can be said of Peter Davies.<br/><br/>During the film, I believe the theme of Finding Neverland is summed by Mrs. Snow (Eileen Essell) as she says to Mr. Barrie, ""I suppose it's like the ticking crocodile, isn't it? Time is chasing after all of us, isn't that right?"""

The magical world and the 'real world' juxtapose very well thanks to the mesmerizing score, the fantastic special effects, fine editing, the lyrical writing and poetic story itself and the superb direction.<br/><br/>J.M. Barrie has given us one of the most beloved children's novel and this movie beautifully captures the magic that Barrie created in his best works. There have been arguments that 'Finding Neverland' wasn't historically or factually accurate but that's not the point because this is an inspiration, not a depiction, of Barrie's life during the time he began writing 'Peter Pan' and had it been rather factual than imaginative, it would have lost its magic.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is phenomenal as the creator of Peter Pan. The accent seems to have come very natural to him and his understated acting is outstanding. Kate Winslet too is terrific with her subtle performance. Her reaction to Barrie whenever he talks about Neverland and the fantasy world are remarkable. Julie Christie is very good and Dustin Hoffman provides some splendid comic relief with a laidback performance. Of the child actors, Freddy Highmore and Joe Prospero stand out.<br/><br/>Director Forster has earlier made the gripping 'Monster's Ball' and later on interesting movies like 'Stranger Than Fiction' and 'Stay' but without a doubt, 'Finding Neverland' is his greatest film to date. It's been a one of a kind movie experience. Magical."

","This one was highly recommended by a number of friends. So I watched it and found that it was really worthwhile. However, during the 2-hour view, I had it in my head in a constant comparison with my all-time favorite Big Fish; maybe because they both have the same themes, and almost share the same dreamy world of imagination. However, weighing them both, Big Fish was certainly heavier! I can't really say why... maybe I'm prejudiced to Big Fish because I relate more to it, or maybe because I've seen it first, which makes Finding Neverland a candy-like repetition. I don't really know! However, Finding Neverland is one good movie, and I can't deny it. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet managed to captivate me with their mighty performances (as usual!). The story was so real and dreamy at the same time. Some of the credit must go to Marc Forster as well for creating such a beautiful experience so vividly."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Depp and Winslet have nice on-screen chemistry, and are perfectly balanced, neither stealing the scene from the other. I found it amusing to note that Dustin Hoffman played in Hook as Captain Hook and that Depp has played the iconic Captain Jack Sparrow. So, here we have two actors that have played pirates (in other films) here in a story about how Peter Pan, the play, came about. Aside from that, this is a film with superb performances all around.<br/><br/>The story of how JM Barrie is nicely portrayed here. Winslet as the widowed mother of 4 boisterous boys is believable. The ending when she dies is not graphic or overdone. Barrie manages to bring to her home a surprise of the entire cast and scenery of Peter Pan and Neverland for her to experience, since Mrs. Davies cannot go to the play. I found myself moved to tears, but in a good way."

I'm looking forward to see what the director does with the next Bond movie. Johnny Depp was OK, but far from great.

I've watched it twice and the second time the film even touched me more.<br/><br/>This is a slow-moving story, so don't expect to get into a roller coaster ride of fun. The most important things are the little moments of beauty in life that our main character discovers after he met the Davies family, and how these help him to finally bring out his Peter Pan, Captain Hook, Wendy, and even the dog Nana, from his imagination. I think most artists or writers can really relate to the film. Actually, anyone with a tender heart will love this film. The whole cast did wonderful job. Johnny Depp seems to really understand his character. Kate Winslet is graceful and strong. The children did fine too ,especially the one who plays Peter. He can play a boy with such a tender soul whose heart has been shattered and you could see why this character is so special to Barry. No one wants to see a boy like this losing his gift of creativity because of grief so early in life. The music in this film makes you feel like you're in a fairly tale. The pictures are spectacular. This movie makes you feel that Neverland is so close to you,only if you open your heart to it.<br/><br/>I don't know how to describe it more than this.

","I had seen a trailer for this film, and thought it looked quite interesting, the story of how one of children's' most loved stories came about, from BAFTA (the David Lean Award for Direction) and Golden Globe nominated director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball). Basically, in London, 1903, play writer Sir James Matthew Barrie/J.M. Barrie (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Johnny Depp) has a complete lack of inspiration, and his latest play is pretty much a failure. The one day in the park he meets the children of widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (BAFTA nominated Kate Winslet), and after a little while James becomes a close friend of the family, and they have wonderful days playing games using their imaginations. James also gains his inspiration from muse Sylvia, and her lovable children, and he writes the successful play (and story) about ""Peter Pan and Neverland"". Also starring BAFTA nominated Julie Christie as Mrs. Emma Du Maurier, Radha Mitchell as Mary Ansell Barrie, Dustin Hoffman as Charles Frohman, Ian Hart as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Eileen Essell as Mrs. Snow, The Fast Show's Paul Whitehouse as Stage Manager, Freddie Highmore as Peter Llewelyn Davies, Joe Prospero as Jack Llewelyn Davies, Nick Roud as George Llewelyn Davies, Luke Spill as Michael Llewelyn Davies, Kelly Macdonald as ""Peter Pan"", Mackenzie Crook as Mr. Jaspers - Usher and Tony Way as Set Mover. It is really clever with the family and James using their imagination, e.g. for a pirate ship adventure, and it has its emotional moments (obviously Sylvia's death the big one), a good biographical film. It won the Oscar for Best Music for Jan A.P. Kaczmarek, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Kate Winslet was number 55, and Johnny Depp number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Depp was also number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Winslet was number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 29, and Depp number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor.

","When I saw Hideous Kinky about a year ago, I enjoyed Kate Winslet's performance so much I felt I needed to see as much of her footage as possible. Also having Pirates 2 in the cinemas at that time and stating that Depp is one of my favorite actors (and certainly not just because of this look) I told myself how fantastic it would be if someone would make a movie with Depp AND Winslet. Next day I saw this DVD in the HMV and 2 seconds later I already payed for it.<br/><br/>Peter Pan in the Disneyversion? Never liked that story. But Finding Neverland tells the true story, as J.M. Barrie experienced it. And what a great idea to do so. Depp is an actor that can work with scissors, pirate hats or a chocolate factory, but also as a Scottish writer. His accent is nearly flawless, as are his lines. He does what not a lot of actors do; he really, really becomes J.M. Barrie. And Kate Winslet. Oh God, Kate Winslet. I have made comments on IMDb about her and they were all positive, she is fantastic! Also in Finding Neverland. What a great, strong performance.<br/><br/>Though so very often kids acting are not really as good as their parents think (being pushed around), these kids do exactly what they need to do. Though in some kind of a supporting role, they shine and they shimmer.<br/><br/>Last but not least, this story has a message, that maybe is one of the most beautiful ones I've ever heard. When my mum passed away days after I saw the movie, I pictured her in Neverland, too. And it works.<br/><br/>A terrific movie and a must-see, whether you're 7, 70 or 100 years old."

","You don't computer graphics, crime scenes or sex scenes to make a great movie. Beauty is great in its own true essence and when simplicity pairs up with it, what you get is a heart-warming moment to cherish and love. Finding Neverland truly is a journey for everyone who watches it, where for a glimpse of a moment, you experience innocence and the youth now lost to many. You don't have to be sentimental to appreciate this movie, you just have to feel when you look upon the tears streaming down those beautiful young faces(which I believe are absolutely genuine and truly heart-felt). You just have to feel when simple words no more understandable to you than to children move them in such a way that you seem entranced and pause for a moment, wondering where their emotion came from and why you don't feel the same. This is because innocence and youth know nothing but joy and beauty. You just have to feel...<br/><br/>As for the acting and screenplay, all wonderfully fulfilled, each person bringing in the essence of what is required to their character, be it the sternness of a overly-preoccupied yet passionate and caring aging mother, or the sorrow of a mother of four who would sacrifice her own health to bring the best of happiness into her family. As for the main character, which I believe in my point of view, are the ones played by Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore (aka Peter), they bring to life the very meaning of J.M. Barrie; that is to say, anything is possible if you believe.<br/><br/>I would give it a 9.5/10 (the deduction for the small bores at the beginning of the film) and strongly recommend it for those who believe sentimentality and emotions are too benign and childish for them. Remember, isn't that what Julie Christie's character, or the audience of the opening night first believed?"

","Truth is sometimes more disturbing than fiction, which is perhaps why it's best to regard Mark Forster's new film Finding Neverland as a wondrous fairytale, rather than condemn it for distorting history.<br/><br/>Adapted from Allan Knee's stage play, ""The Boy Who Was Peter Pan"" by David Mcgee, Finding Neverland explores the birth of Peter Pan, one of the most well-loved children's' stories of all time, through emphatically rose-coloured glasses.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is for the best. Who would want to watch the biopic of a 1.5m tall almost certainly impotent man, a man that allegedly falsified a dying woman's will to gain guardianship of her boys  his greatest friends? No, the real JM Barrie sounds at the worst sinister and at the best...strange.<br/><br/>Give me Johnny Depp's Barrie any day, understatedly handsome, kind and with a touch of his role in The Pirates of The Caribbean left in him that only comes out in play. Add a reason for the source of his devotion to the Du Maurier boys  their lively and beautiful but ailing mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet). Explore an idyllic summer of games, picnics, and Cowboys and Indians between a simpatico group: Depp, Winslet, the four Du Maurier boys and a dog. It's thrilling to witness the birth of such a well-loved story.<br/><br/>As for the barriers to their union, Barrie's wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) is a shallow social climber whose elegant costume is the best thing about her. In the film, of course, not in history, as is the disapproval of Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie). And although the film opens with Barrie's latest play flopping at the box office, to the discomfort of American producer Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman), in reality, Barrie was at the height of his success.<br/><br/>But back to fantasy. The several segues into magical landscape recall those of Heavenly Creatures (1995) but are smoother, and without the darkness of that film. The costuming and set design recreate Edwardian London, with Mitchell and Winslet's dresses being particularly exquisite. Accents are appropriate, although Depp's Scottish burr is not entirely convincing. Despite this he deserved his Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor.<br/><br/>This Barrie selflessly shares his creative wisdom with the youngest boy, Peter (impressively portrayed by Freddie Highmore)  a current skeptic and future writer. This Barrie inspires Sylvia's crotchety mother to clap her hands and say, ""I believe in fairies"". This Barrie is the kind of man we want all great artists to be: generous with their time; emotionally intelligent; eccentric but normal. A man we can understand. But how many great artists truly are like that? I don't care: I want to believe."

","I've always been rather skeptical about the Peter Pan fable. Peter Pan isn't really a children's story. It's downright horrifying. The original tale talks of a boy, living in a world of his own, never being able to grow up. A boy who went to Neverland so long ago that he can't remember who his parents were. And, in his innocence, drags other children along with him. I imagine how their parents must feel, and I always think, what a tragedy, and what an excuse for happiness? Anyway, Finding Neverland comes packaged with some stellar acting performances by Depp and Winslet, and the children were spot on. But I am at a loss in trying to classify this movie. Does it talk about hope? about the power of imagination? about love? It doesn't seem to have a focus.

","A man stands alone pacing back and forth on a worn out carpet that is not foreign to this routine. It is opening night and James Barrie, well known author and playwright, anticipates a successful night, for it is the unveiling of his latest creation, Peter Pan.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has been on a roll since his last picture Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. In his latest film Finding Neverland, he plays James Barrie, a struggling author who has just produced an atrocity of a play. By chance he encounters a widow played by Kate Winslet (Titanic) and her three children having a pleasant time in the park. Barrie loves the chemistry between the children, but one of them, Peter, is sort of an outsider who never wants to be playful ever since his father died. Barrie gets an idea. The movie entails Barrie going on many adventures with the family with pirates and Indians right in the comfort of their backyards.<br/><br/>Once again Depp deserves another nomination from the academy. The picture is a wonderful interpretation of the conception of the masterpiece that is Peter Pan, the story that children of all ages have come to know and love. Depp fits the role so perfectly that his Scottish accent seems almost too real. The movies flow is extremely well crafted. During some parts of the movie where imagination crosses with reality, whether it is ""finding Neverland"" or dancing with a bear. The cinematography is unbelievable. The camera moves around as if it was a feather caught in an updraft. Flying a kite gives the viewer the sensation of hovering over the ground hundreds of feet in the air.<br/><br/>Depp is known for his being a man with scissors for hands or a drug lord. As he says in the movie, ""The boy is gone."" The boy really is gone after this picture. Pirates of the Caribbean showed Depp's acting capabilities to a higher level, but Finding Neverland raises his status as Oscar worthy indeed. The Academy Awards will be interesting for sure with Depp, Jamie Foxx (Ray), Bill Murray (The Life Aquatic), and a lot of other worthy actors in the hunt for that little statue. The winner is still close to call at this point in time.<br/><br/>This movie won't win Best Picture, but a nomination would not be a shocker at all. This movie features extremely good acting, music, and camera work. Kate Winslet puts forth a very good effort in her role. She did a better job in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but her performance in Finding Neverland is none the less well done. Not only do the headliners shine, but the children do as well. The casting department deserves an A for this project.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland is a movie that the whole family can enjoy. It is not just another run of the mill movie about Peter Pan like the others are. This movie has made its mark in movie history and won't easily be forgotten. I give Finding Neverland a standing ovation."

","Who'd have thunk that the director to take this adaptation of the play ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan"" to the screen would be the same guy who directed ""Monster's Ball""? Then again,who would've thought that the guy who was once Cry-Baby,Edward Scissorhands,Hunter S. Thompson,George Jung or Captain Jack Sparrow would be able to put such a gentle and accurate touch to Pan's creator,James M.Barrie?<br/><br/>This offering(a previous commentary was spot-on about this)was a very hyped and Award-ready film,brought to the viewing public by none other than the Weinstein Brothers and Miramax. But still--almost in spite of the publicity overkill--this film is every bit as special and remarkable as its press would have one to believe.<br/><br/>Barrie(Johnny Depp)is a frustrated playwright living in London whose chance meeting with an old-monied widow(Kate Winslet) and her four young sons allows for the inspiration he needs,eventually culminating in the creation of the book,then play ""Peter Pan"". <br/><br/>The story is,as most stories of famous occurrences,a richer and deeper tale. The play itself is quite a reach for early twentieth century theatrical production,and selling his already skeptical,bottom-line producer(one-time Captain Hook Dustin Hoffman,understated and brilliant as ever here)is a difficult chore. Barrie's marriage to soft-spoken Mary(Radha Mitchell,also proving to be chameleon-like in her career thus far)is already cold and about to grow colder due to her husband's interest in the widow and her sons. Then,there's the complicated relationship between the widow and her sons(among them,Freddie Highmore as Peter,the most stubborn and sullen of the four),which is unusual for any period. Added in the right amount of tension from the protective mother of the widow Sylvia,played with quiet strength by screen veteran Julie Christie. The director and writers rightly gambled on mixing elements of fantasy into the very real story that is brewing here,because without it,it feels like the explanation of a man-child wanting to manifest his simple dreams into real fantasy might seem stilted or truly strange. Instead,it gives it the right amount of understanding and depth.<br/><br/>While there are some similarities to another man-child who's become famous for delving into his own never-ending fantasy of youth and adventure while attaining fame and fortune for his own artist endeavors(I won't name names but here's a hint:his name rhymes with Rykol MAckson),what I've read about Mr.Barrie and what just about anyone who has owned a television has heard or learned about the King of Pop tells me that J.M.Barrie's life was considerably less sordid or disturbing than the man recently acquitted in a California court.<br/><br/>This film is a wonderful story within a story. Acting,direction,script and effects are all very memorable. Don't let the genteel,costume-type productions fool you:this film is as accessible as it is fanciful. You might even want to bring a hankie,too."

","Nominated as one of the best films of 2004, ""Finding Neverland"" sweeps us off our feet with the story of the creation of J.M. Barrie's play ""Peter Pan"". Playwright J.M Barrie's (Johnny Depp) latest play not only fails him, but also leaves him without hope of ever writing a successful play. One afternoon in the park, J.M. Barrie is attempting to create a play when he is introduced to the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four sons. The six of them form a surrogate family and with the memories they create, Barrie finds the inspiration he needs that will help him produce ""Peter Pan"", his greatest play ever.<br/><br/>The hidden message in this film is that there is imagination in everyone; it just needs to be awakened. There is a scene in the movie where Barrie teaches the Davies boys that if they believe in something hard enough, it can come true. Barrie sparks their imagination by pretending his dog is a bear and dances with it. Peter, one of the Davies boys, refuses to imagine anything and insists the dog is not a bear. Peter is trying to grow up too fast, so it is up to Barrie to reignite the boy's imagination spark. While helping Peter, Barrie finds his own imagination has been revived.<br/><br/>""Finding Neverland"" is classified into the drama genre because of the intense character building and character relationships. Historically, this movie was quite accurate, including small details such as Barrie's Scottish accent. The actors cast for this film did a phenomenal job of captivating audiences of all ages and types. As far as music and graphics goes, it only enhanced the beauty of this story.

","SPOILERS One of the biggest stories of all time, ""Peter Pan"" is treasured by young and old alike. Telling the story of a young boy who never grew up, Sir James Matthew Barrie's tale has captivated audiences for a hundred years. Based on a play of the authors life and where he got his inspiration, ""Finding Neverland"" deservedly received multiple Oscar Nominations in 2005. Led from the front by a consistently amazing Johnny Depp, the story tugs on the heart strings as we learn the true identity of the boy who never grew up, and we experience the world of Neverland all over again.<br/><br/>Sir J.M.Barrie (Johnny Depp) is a writer who's current work has flopped badly. Writing in the park with his dog one day, Barrie encounters four boys called Peter, Jack, George and Michael (Freddie Highmore, Joe Prospero, Nick Roud and Luke Spill). Spending increasing amounts of time with the boys and their widow mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet), Barrie begins to come up with his greatest ever work.<br/><br/>Stories like ""Finding Neverland"" are always bound to impress the Academy when it comes to Oscars. Beautifully written and superbly acted, it is a glorious film which makes us all feel young again and really gets us embracing our childhood. The eventual fact that it didn't win any major awards should be a surprise, but the more you scan your eyes across the nominees for the year, the stronger the competition looks. Films like ""Sideways"", ""The Aviator"", ""Ray"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", they all emit charm and talent in their respective areas and the eventual decisions cannot have been easy for the voters to make. In ""Finding Neverland"" in particular, the one difficult decision in regards to awards is the performance of Depp who is fast progressing into one of the finest actors of his generation.<br/><br/>Over the years, Johnny Depp has been in some awful films. He's also been in some outstanding ones. The strange thing about Depp though is that he is always outstanding. This in itself is weird because questions have to be asked about how it took so many of us so long to notice. In recent films though, his variety has been enormous. He's played a pirate bearing a resemblance of Keith Richards, he's played a disturbed author, he's even played a drug fuelled Victorian detective. Whatever Depp plays though, he always seems to actually make the character not only believable, but almost impossible to criticise. As Jack Sparrow in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" you could actually imagine that Depp spoke with that voice and attitude in real life, now in ""Finding Neverland"" you find yourself believing that he was actually born in Scotland and that his accent is his real one. It's like the man is possessed and schizophrenic or something, he just manages to play so many varied parts with absolute skill and ability, he's purely gifted.<br/><br/>To be fair to the rest of the cast, Depp isn't alone in putting forward a great performance here. As the young emotionally fragile Peter, young Freddie Highmore is excellent. Playing the character with heart, Highmore is stunning and could quite easily give Depp a run for his money in a few years.<br/><br/>As experienced actors go, Kate Winslet and Julie Christie are sublime. Winslet received a lot of attention for her performance here and it's not difficult to see why. What's perhaps more surprising is why Christie didn't receive equal coverage. As Winslet's mother, Christie demonstrates why she's sometimes referred to as a legend. She grabs the hold of the character of Mrs du Maurier and really makes the role her own. We know exactly why she dislikes Barrie and whilst we wish she could understand, she manages to actually convince us that she's right. She is superb, and like Winslet, she deserved a bit more praise.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the things which really makes ""Finding Neverland"" so good is that it reminds us of our childhood. Showing us a well loved tale in a different light it hits a spot and makes us feel magical again. So many films attempt to remind us of the old stories, but few really grab you by the imagination and bring you back to your childhood. ""Finding Neverland"" has the rare gift of achieving this, and it should not be cast aside lightly.<br/><br/>Yet, despite every praise we might have for ""Finding Neverland"" the film isn't perfect. It's ending does feel slightly incomplete, the pace is inconsistent, ranging from fast to non-existent, the character of Barrie's wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) is touched upon but never fully analysed, and one or two scenes do feel unnecessary. These flaws are all justify complaints, and they do ruin the film to a degree, but when a film is so well acted and really does bring you back to your childhood, even the most crucial of mistakes can be forgiven.<br/><br/>""Finding Neverland"" is a wonderful film. Well acted throughout, it brings us back to our childhood in a way few ever thought possible. We relive ""Peter Pan"" as if for the first time, and for that the creators should be thanked. Yes, the film is not perfect, but for the feeling the majority of the experience gives us, we should feel once more like we can be young forever."

"bob-rutzel","8","0","0","27 March 2005"," Good Family Movie
","I said this was a good family movie, that is, if you don't look into other things: Barrie's relationship with his wife (they slept in separate bedrooms), his seemingly platonic relationship with the mother (neither one advances any interest in the other), and his compulsion to play with children (but that could have been research for Peter Pan). If you don't look at those things this is a good family movie. In other words, just watch and enjoy the movie, don't ask questions. May not be anything there anyway.<br/><br/>The pace is even and moves along nicely. I love the Scottish accent and Depp brings it off perfectly. We can only assume that Barrie was a more than even-tempered gentleman.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see Barrie be more consumed, okay animated, with this idea of a Peter Pan. Depp plays Barrie too laid back I thought, but if Barrie was a laid back kind of guy what choice does Depp have? No where in this film does Barrie get even mildly animated, except when he is playing with the kids, of course, and there it's okay. And, even there it is mild. So Depp's performance must be considered outstanding. In fact, Depp is outstanding in everything he plays in. Why hasn't he won an Oscar? <br/><br/>The whole production is excellent. Dustin Hoffman plays the part as Barrie's financial backer. Julie Christie plays Winslet's mother. She could have played her sister. I would like to know what Julie Christie eats. She looks more than great. Maybe I should go see Dr. Zhivago again. Do you realize how long ago that was? What does she eat? She looks really, really good."

"ethone","9","0","0","18 March 2005"," A fairy tale itself
","This movie totally touched me. It's not the Titanic-type drama touching you on a tragic level. It's a fairy tale in itself, with it's theme, plot and images touching me like hardly any movie has before. The only other movies that have touched me in a similar way were Amélie and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.<br/><br/>Similar to both of the afore mentioned, the composition of images in Finding Neverland is helping a great deal to create the atmosphere of the movie. The movie is so fairy tale like to me mostly because it just feels like it's all playing in your imagination, with bright and colorful pictures, in front of the advancing and serious plot, but with childish interludes, catching the spirit of J.M.Barrie's Peter Pan play.<br/><br/>For the actors, they don't really shine but do a good job at playing what was demanded of them. Notable exceptions are the Barrie kids, who stroke me as absolutely perfect for their roles. Johnny Depp's go at the very English accent is a good one too. The score, the cinematography, the jokes, the dialogue... Everything is perfect or not even average enough to spoil this great movie for me."
"monkeeking","Null","0","0","27 February 2005"," Surprisingly enjoyable.
","""Finding Neverland"" is an interesting drama-fantasy about James Matthew Barrie's inspiring and unusual relationship with the Davies family. It was this relationship that Barrie (Johnny Depp) based his play Peter Pan on.<br/><br/>Director Marc Forester shows us in a unique yet comprehensible way in which Barrie would find his own world of imagination that he dubbed ""Neverland"". Barrie would escape to Neverland and use his imagined adventures as inspiration for his plays. Through his regular walks in the park we meet the troubled Davies family, consisting of the widowed mother Sylvia Llewellyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her five children. Despite the disapproval of the surrounding London community, Barrie goes on to nurture his valuable relationship with the boys and their mother. Through him the boys learn to overcome their father's death and explore the beauties of life. For much of the film's duration we follow Barrie and the Davies family in their frequent ""adventures"" in Neverland, each one bearing a distinguishable similarity with the classic play. Forester doesn't offend his audience by corrupting these fantasy sequences with clichéd explanations or occurrences such as dreams or ""a sudden, blinding white light"". Instead we travel fluently between fantasy and reality, each being easily recognizable. Despite the wonderful direction during these fantasy sequences, I must say that those in ""Belle de jour"" are ultimately superior considering they come from the master of surrealism, Luis Bunuel, who always leaves you guessing on what was real and what was hallucination, flashback, or dream.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives a performance void of life; although this can be considered appropriate being that it is supposedly so similar to the withdrawn and shy J.M. Barrie. Kate Winslet is perfect for the role of a caring yet seriously ill mother trying to make the most out of life. The young actors playing the children surprised me that their performances weren't cheesy or corny.<br/><br/>Excellent and subtle acting (no scene chewing) from the entire cast. Surprisingly enjoyable and original for a fantasy-drama film. The film does, however, take a few liberties. Sylvia is already a widow when Barrie meets her and it was also rumored that Barrie was a womanizer, although he is represented in a totally different light in this interpretation.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The whole idea of Peter Pan always annoyed me as a kid, and even more so lately thanks to the real life plight of Wacko Jacko and his Neverland ranch. As such, I had great reservations about ""Finding Neverland."" The whole ""unlock your imagination"" and ""inspired by a true story"" nature of the plot seemed trite, and from the earliest previews it was obvious Kate Winslet's character was going to die. But even so, thanks to solid direction from the up-and-coming Marc Forster, and engaging performances from the entire cast (most notably of course Johnny Depp sporting an excellent accent and Kate Winslet fantastic as always) this wishy-washy tear jerker was kept afloat in spite of itself. In the end we are charmed by a nice period piece showing us how J. M. Barrie found inspiration for his most famous work after befriending a widow and her young sons. It's a crowd pleaser, even though this sappy pseudo-factual stuff is not normally my cup of tea."

","Finding Neverland is a film not to be missed. The story about author J.M. Barrie, who strikes a friendship with the Llewelyn Davies family and is inspired by them to create the play ""Peter Pan"", is beauty in cinematic form.<br/><br/>The screenplay is rich and intelligent, concentrating on Barrie's relationship with the Llewelyn Davies family and his marriage with ex-actress Mary (Radha Mitchell), while also emphasizing the infinite value of imagination and creativity. The cinematography is lush, conveying the rustic beauty of early 20th century England - particularly gorgeous are the hues of green, red and gold.<br/><br/>The performances are incredible. Johnny Depp continues to impress with his range, combining the playfulness of a child with the reasoning of an adult in his portrayal of Barrie. Kate Winslet is excellent as a woman guided by the love for her children. Also stirring are Julie Christie's performance as Sylvia's mother and Freddie Highmore's portrayal of Peter, one of the sons.<br/><br/>This film will make you smile, cry and think.

","""Magnificent. The boy is gone. In the last 30 seconds... you became a grown-up."" It's probably quite important to inform those who perhaps do not know anything at all about Finding Neverland, that it is not the actual story of Peter Pan  it is the story of Sir James Matthew Berrie who created Peter Pan.<br/><br/>After writing a theatrical flop, Berrie (Depp) heads down to the local park to ponder new ideas for a play, where he meets Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Winslet) and her children  one of whom is Peter (Highmore). Peter is a young boy struggling to come to terms with his father's death and immediately bonds the closest to Barrie. Barrie spends more and more time with Sylvia and her children, causing issues within the 'polite society' as he spends more time with Sylvia than his own wife (Mitchell), and even more time with the young boys. Berrie encourages the children to use their imaginations and takes them all on adventures  the basis of which would become Berrie's next play 'Peter Pan'.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Depp's performance as Barrie, and Winslet's performance as an ill widow trying to raise her children in the hardest of circumstances was fantastic. Melbourne girl Radha Mitchell was extremely good as the lonely wife who has lost her husband to his work and perhaps another family, but the most surprising performance for me, came from Freddie Highmore, who I found not only took, but ran, with the highly emotional character of Peter Llewelyn Davies. Johnny Depp obviously admired the eleven year old Highmore, as he requested Tim Burton to cast him as Charley, in the up coming remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>Director Marc Foster (Monster's Ball) did a great job, and while it did take me a little while to get into this film, once in, I found it to be a wonderful piece of work, which I would love to watch again."

","""Finding Neverland"" is a fact-based story about the life of J.M. Barrie, the author of the classic play and book ""Peter Pan"". Although the setting is England in the early 1900s, the movie is a sort of fantasy picture, often set within the imaginations of the characters. As Barrie, Johnny Depp is a playwright who is struggling with two things, fulfilling his marriage and capturing his creative output on stage. When he encounters a widow and her four children in the park, the quintet provide a conduit for his flowing imagination, an outpouring that results in the play for which Barrie is best known, as well as his domestic issues crescendoing to an ultimatum.<br/><br/>The power of imagination is the driving theme of ""Neverland"", and is also where the movie excels. During the adventures of Depp and the children, the picture jumps back and forth from the backyard or park to the theater of the mind, which ranges from dense jungle to the raging open seas. These transitions are exactly why cinema exists, to work as the mind does while reading a book, breaking the typical space continuum of stage and being. As good as these parts were, they could have been even better with more screen time or more elaborate production design. As it was, they are still the highlight of the film, but leave the viewer wanting more. <br/><br/>The medium also allows the audience to observe how ""Peter Pan"" was conceived. I grew up watching the animated Disney movie countless times, reading the book, even playing the titular character in a play, so seeing how Barrie's mind transforms commonplace events into fantastical adventures was exceptionally thrilling for me. I don't think that a knowledge of the book is required, but it definitely enhances the viewing experience, as you will not only pick up on the obvious clues, but also find other hints scattered throughout.<br/><br/>Depp turns in a fine performance as Barrie, earnestly illustrating the emotional frustration that he endures under the restraining expectations of society. While Depp shines as usual, the rest of the adult cast is merely passable, despite marquee names like Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman, and Julie Christie. The blame should not be pinned on them entirely however, as their parts are generally stock characters seemingly there simply for Depp to act against. The children's roles also suffer a bit from the script. Although all the youngsters are good, their words are often overly mature. But their eager and innocent faces are just as important, and in that realm they all succeed wildly.<br/><br/>What irks me most about ""Neverland"" is Barrie's flawed character. The creative aspects of his life are wonderfully presented, but the domestic portions emit a sketchy moral vibe. Despite the film's best efforts at portraying his wife as a borderline villain, I found her complaints about Barrie's physical and emotional absence understandable. Yes, they had many differences, both personal and societal, but to me that doesn't excuse his discomforting emotional affair, even if it spawned an all-time great piece of literature.<br/><br/>Despite that flaw, ""Finding Neverland"" is a fresh look at the liberating and connecting power of the imagination, and a glimpse into the creation of a classic, blissfully free of the pretense that often accompanies would-be Oscar candidates, Not as great as some critics think, but it provides a frequently enchanting experience, reminiscent of last year's Big Fish.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: It made most of the women in my theater cry, and brought a smile to my face. 7 of 10."

","To say the least, Finding Neverland was incredible. Somehow, you get really attached to the character of Mr. Barrie as Johnny Depp plays him. He just seems to be such an honest, nice guy who always just wants to help. And I think it helps that he is not overly passionate about any of the events in his day to day life except for his fun with the kids and their mother. Rarely do I go to see a movie expecting it to be wonderful and walk out thinking it was even more wonderful that I had expected. But with this movie, I really didn't have much criticism at all. Of course, it could be that I am biased because of my adoration for Johnny Depp, but I'd like to think that it was the portrayal of characters like J.M. Barrie and Peter and even the Peter Pan in Barrie's play at the theater. In fact, I think the magic was the best part, the part that really left an impression on everyone in the theater whether they liked it or not. The way you were suddenly placed into J.M. Barrie's imagination was so smooth a transition, either by a turn of the camera view or the blink of someone's eye, it was always more than you expected. And as for Neverland itself,... Well, I can see why it was so sought after."

In the park one day, he befriends the sons of Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies, and the friendship with not only the boys but also with Sylvia grows. The adventures he has while playing with the boys inspires him, and he begins writing Peter Pan. The movie focuses on this relationship and how it affects those in J.M.'s life.

","""Finding Neverland"" is not based on my relentless pursuit to visit The Playboy Mansion. It is also not based on my own dreams to seize supreme pun powers in a literary fantasy-land called ""Cleverland"". Anyway, ""Finding Neverland"" is Director Marc Forster's enchanting narrative on the inspiration behind ""Peter Pan"". Obviously, the centerpiece of the story is J.M. Barrie, the Scottish author of ""Peter Pan"". This fervent jewel of a film focuses on Barrie's friendship & kinship with four fatherless Scottish juvenile lads and their moribund mother. I really dipped into Depp's subdued, but yet, goodwill performance. By previously taking on a swashbuckler role in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and now an author who inspired a fairytale which a swashbuckler is the villain, one can state that Depp is hooked on the spearing seaman thing. I guess a ""pirate's life for him"". Kate Winslet scores high with yet another winning performance as the courageous mother, Sylvia Davies. Freddie Highmore also sparkles as Peter, the young Davies boy which becomes the primary emphasis of Barrie's inspiration. Because of his stellar work, Highmore should rank ""high"" in the child actor department by receiving ""more & more"" lucrative acting gigs. Hollywood, Are you ready for Freddie? Dustin Hoffman (playing Theatre Director Charles Frohman) and Julie Christie (playing the controlling grandmother Emma Du Maurier) contribute their well-respected expertise to their roles. But the hero of this tale is not Johnny Depp, nor Peter Pan, nor J.M. Barrie, and not even Wendy. It was Director Marc Forster's illuminating vision of Barrie's experiences with the Davies. With ""Monster's Ball"" and now ""Neverland"", Forster proves that he is a Director ""forceter"" to be reckon with. Screenwriter David Magee developed a tender dialogue that will cause viewers to be ""finding handkerchiefs"". So straighten up and fly right and visit ""Finding Neverland"". **** Good"

","A touching, gentle, surprising piece of work from Marc Forster, whose ""Monster's Ball"" was such a brutally heartwrenching film. Forster continues to enhance his reputation as one of the best directors working in Hollywood today, just as Johnny Depp continues to enhance his reputation as possibly the best actor working in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>Depp plays J.M. Barrie, playwright and author, living in London in 1903. He's trapped in a marriage that, if not loveless, is certainly lacking the spark that Forster's subtle hand hints might once have been there. His most recent play, a pretentious and wordy piece called ""Little Mary"", has bored both critics and audiences alike out of their minds. His producer (Dustin Hoffman) is beginning to lose faith in him. All in all, he's definitely in a rut when he goes out to take his dog for a walk in the park one day.<br/><br/>While out, he meets the Llewellyn-Davies family, consisting of mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet, giving an earthy, very real performance), and children George, Jack, Peter, and Michael. All the boys have unusually good imaginations - except for Peter, played by child phenom Freddie Highmore. He is a wounded and frightened soul badly traumatized by his father's death from cancer of the jaw, and Barrie immediately latches onto the boy, encouraging him to write and to use his imagination.<br/><br/>Barrie becomes a surrogate father figure for the boys, much to the consternation of their grandmother (the appropriately stiff Julie Christie). He also becomes something entirely different to Sylvia, and it's debatable just what their relationship was. I think that Forster dropped some very subtle hints via judicious cutting that it was sexual in nature at least at some point. My girlfriend, who I saw it with, disagrees. In any case, Barrie and Sylvia become close as well.<br/><br/>Barrie is inspired enough by the boys to write his play ""Peter Pan"", which became the basis for the book - and I don't need to tell you where it went from there. Sylvia, meanwhile is deathly ill with an ailment she refuses to see a doctor for (probably tuberculosis), insisting on burying her head in the sand. Barrie's ultimate task is to help these boys, who he had hoped would never grow up, into adulthood so they can help their mother through her illness.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie, a quality it shares with another really wonderful film about a blocked writer called ""Shakespeare in Love"", is its sense of creative magic. Watching Barrie's play develop as his relationship with this family develops and deepens is a beautiful experience. And the inevitable end result of this relationship, this opening of hearts, is difficult to watch without shedding a tear or two.<br/><br/>Another invaluable asset to the film was Freddie Highmore, who gives the best juvenile performance since young Mr. Osment walked onto our movie screens. He manages to be preternaturally cold for such a little boy, but manages to cave in emotionally when the time comes. The release of his pent-up fears, doubts, and resentments is a powerful rage that it's somewhat awe-inspiring to see expressed in one so young. Freddie will doubtless be rewarded for his efforts with an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>A fine, fine film. Not the best of the year perhaps, but a very strong piece of work. Bravo, Messrs. Forster, Depp, and Highmore."

","Finding Neverland is one of the top five movies I have seen this year. Not since Mystic River has a movie been so deeply effective in it's rich, emotional tone. The acting is superb from Johnny Depp as the author Barrie, to Julie Christie as the stern mother figure, to the child actors who all turn in Oscar-worthy performances (most especially, the child who plays young Peter). The cinematography is rich and adds depth to the film. The costumes are gorgeous. The direction is swift and to the point, without sacrificing the story. This film is a good example of how one cinematic moment can speak volumes. The other great thing about this film is how it delves into the creative process and shows us Barrie's love of the theatre and his intricate mind. Like A Beautiful Mind, we get to see the inner process of a brilliant man. Attention movie studios: it would be nice to see a movie as good as this one, where a woman got to be the central character."

","While not entirely accurate in it's depiction this film does shed some light on how the story Peter Pan was conceived and it's accomplished by another performance by one of our more versatile actors. Story is set in 1903 London where we watch playwright J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) suffering through the failure of his new play but one day while walking in the park he meets a widow and her 4 boys. Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet) is having a hard time keeping her boys under control but Barrie is immediately amused by they're fun and games and he's also attracted to her as well. Barrie starts spending more and more time with them and it doesn't sit right with his wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) or Sylvia's mother Emma (Julie Christie) who wants to run the household with more stability.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Barrie and the boys play assorted games such as cowboys and Indians and pirates and while all this goes on he continues to write in his journal until he gets the idea for Peter Pan. Unfortunately for Barrie, his wife Mary leaves him and Sylvia contracts an illness which will one day claim her life but before she passes on Barrie makes sure that she gets to see the play that her children helped inspire.<br/><br/>This film is directed by Marc Forster (Monster's Ball) who continues to show that he's one of the more talented directors to come on the scene in years. The script does take some liberties with the facts and it condenses it down to fit the story that Forster wants to tell but it's done well and he's assembled a terrific cast. Depp is arguably the most versatile actor working today and even though the script doesn't really explain the characters inner most thoughts the performance that Depp gives is still engaging. I did feel the film was trying to manipulate it's audience with the death of Sylvia but it seems to redeem it's reasoning with the scene of Barrie bringing the play to the household. The script could really have benefited more with a more concise story of why Barrie never really wanted to grow up and the only scene that tries to do this is the one where he talks of the death of his brother. With that, we still get a sense of believing that Barrie would be inspired by the Davies family and Depp once again shines in an entertaining role. As good as Depp is, young Freddie Highmore who plays Peter is terrific and the scene at the end of the film as he talks of still being able to see his mother is haunting. Even with the sentimental angle the script takes this film still accomplishes what it sets out to do and it does so through a talented director and a top notch cast."

","Sometimes it is best I guess not to go into a film with such high expectations. Such it was when I ventured into ""Finding Neverland"". I expected a lot. On the plus side, all of the acting by the main characters was solid. The cinematography was also fine. The letdown was in the story itself. It simply moved along too slowly. Johnny Depp's persona reminded me of Jim Carrey in ""The Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind."" A rather silent character that always seems to be quietly thinking about something, though what it is we are not too sure. Although Depp's performance is convincing, I feel it needs to be more verbal and expressive. Freddie Highmore is excellent, but his part seems too small in the overall story. Children would probably fall asleep watching ""Finding Neverland"". For adults, however, the slow pace is at least offset by a fine visual expression and the ordeal of the characters in the midst of tragedy, not to mention the creation of Neverland itself. 7/10"

His heart and mind were solely on the boys,. When his favourite was accidentally drowned in Oxford, he turned his attentions to the next boy. Gradually the inspiration for Peter Pan grew and as did his intrusion into the boys' lives.

Johnny Depp once again does not disappoint in this fantasy/drama that depicts how J.M Barrie came up with one of the most beloved plays of the 20th century. The story is so warm with Barrie making friends with a widow and her children but it is also contrasted with darkness as Barrie's marriage to his wife is falling apart. It becomes almost instantly clear that the marriage is in trouble when we see that they slee in separate bedrooms. 2004 has been so far a weak year for movies but it's ones like these that tend to brighten up the silver screen in time for Christmas. 4 out of 5 stars."
"schappe1","Null","0","0","5 December 2004"," Neverland and Oz
","This is not a great film but in the cacophony of cinematic noise, I find it hard to complain about a sweetly sentimental film that deals intelligently with the question of how to face life and then death. Johnny Depp is probably the finest actor of his generation because of his ability to find poetry and whimsy in his characters while remaining a strong, confident screen presence. Kate Winslett is a luminous presence and fine actress in her own right. They boys are exceptional, especially Freddie Highmore, who plays the troubled child Barrie based Peter upon. <br/><br/>The thing that holds the movie back from greatness is the sub-plots. Barries' wife and Winslett's mother are both stiff, unimaginative people who are unable to go where Barrie can go and seem to dislike him for it. Mary Barrie, (Rahda Mitchell), seems more interested in social climbing and Emma Du Maurier, (Julie Christie wants to protect her daughter from the riffraff. It's not very interesting.<br/><br/>The film occasionally moves from reality to fantasy without recognizing any borders between the two. In that sense it resembles 'Big Fish', which did this more aggressively and is more enjoyable. More time in 'Neverland' rather than an occasional stroboscopic visit would have been nice.<br/><br/>Another film people might want to see if they liked this one is the TV movie 'The Dreamer of Oz', about Barrie's American contemporary, L. Frank Baum, who, according to that film, created Oz as a place for his beloved, (and deceased ) niece Dorothy to reside. It's always interested me that Barrie and Baum had different conclusions at the end of their stories. Barrie held that remaining stuck in 'reality' was a prison sentence and that we needed to fly off to find ourselves. Baum, who traveled far and wide looking for happiness only to wish he was back in his home town of Chittenango, concluded that for all our longings, there is no place like home."

He develops a relationship with the Davies' Boys. Their father died of ""chin caner"" and only there mom and grandmother were left to take care of them. The story tells the story of his marriage falling apart, and the process of creating Peter Pan, being influenced by the boys. The film delves into his marriage and his career as well. I saw it yesterday and thought that it was very well done. Johnny Depp was phenomenal in playing the role of a man with never ending imagination. The kids in the movie, especially Peter, made this movie special.<br/><br/>There has been a debate that James Barry (the creator of Peter Pan) had a Michael Jackson like relationship with the boys. The movie acknowledged this and pointed out its falsity. Barry was simply a man who had no children and needed those boys to fill the void in his heart (In real life the children's parents were both still alive when the play was first performed). At first you'll feel sad, and gradually, you'll begin to feel very good. Nobody left the movie untouched. <br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised to see some Oscar nominations come out of this film.

","Greetings again from the darkness. This one caught me a bit off guard. Not exactly sure how it is being marketed, but this is an adult story presented in dramatic fashion by director Marc Forster (""Monster's Ball""). Johnny Depp continues his stellar run of spellbinding performances as Scottish playwright J.M. Barrie, who penned the fantastical ""Peter Pan"". Although the film glosses over many of the details of the enigmatic Barrie's life, it does a wonderful job of capturing his fascination with Andrew and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies' kids and their hunger for playtime and childhood. Freddie Highmore as Peter had more than a few moms in the audience reaching for Kleenex. He will next be seen (again alongside Johnny Depp) in Tim Burton's ""Charlie and Chocolate Factory"" (a reinterpretation by Burton of ""Willy Wonka""). A slimmed down Kate Winslet and still striking Julie Christie play well against Depp and the kids. Dustin Hoffman (miles from his lead in Spielberg's ""Hook"") offers up another nice turn in a supporting role as the theatre owner. Hopefully Hoffman continues embracing these roles as his acting ability really is amazing even though his leading man days are long past. My only concern is that this film will fail to find an audience. It is not a remake of ""Peter Pan"" and most kids will probably be bored.

","I went to see this film about a week ago and was really, really happy when I came out of the cinema. Johnny Depp was absolutely stunning (and not just in looks, either!) - he was exactly right in all his emotional responses. He was soft, gentle and touching at the appropriate moments, but also really realistic in the way he played and interacted with the children, and in the way he talked to Sylvia and Mrs du Maurier. Kate Winslet was also very good, and a very convincing widow and mother, but sadly didn't strike me emotionally the way that Depp did. The other thing that struck me as realistic was the relationship between Barrie and his wife, which was wonderfully cold and sharp.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, I thought it was absolutely beautifully structured and very, very cleverly put together. The way in which they subtly, but still clearly, showed where Barrie got his ideas from for Peter Pan (Mrs du Maurier poking the children with the coathanger (""hook""), the Indians, the pirates...) was ingenious! *SPOILER* The way Sylvia's death was done was also wonderful - it was shown in a very beautiful fashion, very clearly but with not too much sentimentality. Stunning. There were also tiny pieces of cinematography that if you blink, you'll miss, but that actually made the film for me. My favourite was just after a cold confrontation between Barrie and his wife, where it shows them both going into separate rooms, and the door opens to Barrie's to reveal a beautiful garden, blue sky and a tree. It just sums up everything so concisely that they'd been saying in dialogue not quite as eloquently - that Barrie is in a different world from, well, the rest of the world. <br/><br/>Overall, an absolutely wonderful, beautifully constructed and touching film!"

Usually I detest child actors, because well, their acting pretty much is horrible, but the boy who played Peter made me cry. Johnny Depp was great as usual, once again making me believe that he really was J. M. Barrie. Kate Winslet impressed me again, I was really pleased with her performance in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but she did a really great job in this role as well.

Both have a luminous and commanding screen presence. Like Christie with DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, Winslet was lucky enough to appear in a blockbuster film which made possible all the interesting roles that have followed, and there's an Oscar with her name on it in her future - perhaps this will be her year. Of course, Johnny Depp and Dustin Hoffman are no slouches either in the screen presence department - Hoffman doesn't really have a lot to do, but I think he may be going the way of Spencer Tracy - he can do a lot by doing very little.

","12/10.<br/><br/>I always love everything about James M. Barrie, Peter Pan, Charles Frohman, and Maude Adams (Peter's first American portrayer, and not depicted here). Add to that list Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp plus Julie Christie (ah yes, the beautiful ""Lara"" from Doctor Zhivago"").<br/><br/>I saw this movie twice last night; our opening night. I am watching ""Hook"" on TV now. Just played my CD from movie ""Peter Pan 2003"". What can I say? ""Finding Neverland"" is just awesome. For a long time, I have been waiting for it to be released. I hope to get it later on DVD and/or video.<br/><br/>When Sylvia goes to Neverland/Heaven, it is such a beautiful scene instead of her being afraid. She is so brave and happy, and in actuality terminally ill. She is so totally touched by the beauty of this ""Eden"". There are exotic animals; some danced by ballerinas beautifully costumed. They are winged incredible fairies. The most beauteous of all are the young and elegant fairies, who carry Sylvia's train as she enters Neverland dressed in a beautiful gown. Then fade to black and the cemetery scene with everybody dressed in Edwardian black mourning clothing. This austere ending to such a beautiful jungle atmosphere: should get an award for making the audience gasp with total surprise.<br/><br/>Hoffman is great as Frohman (at same time, I was thinking about him in ""The Graduate"" as a very young man). I read, however, that IRL Charles Frohman was enthusiastic about ""Peter Pan"", and certainly never had any money problems in real life (he managed several theaters and many big stars) -- but that Barrie was skeptical and offered Frohman a backup play if ""Peter Pan"" was not successful. Ah well. Frohman, Barrie and Maude Adams (the first American Peter, as stated above) made a fortune from ""Peter Pan"", and in America Peter Pan played in New York and toured the U.S. through 1915 -- when Frohman was killed in the sinking of the ship Lusitania.<br/><br/>The kids were wonderful, especially Peter (who later in life committed suicide from all the comparisons to Peter Pan). Kelly Macdonald was just superb, and so sweet. Johnny Depp superbly underplayed Barrie, who in real life has been depicted as almost a lowlife. Mary Ansell Barrie probably deserved Gilbert Cannan. Maybe she never deserved James Matthew Barrie. Maybe bad things written about Barrie were written by jealous wannabes who didn't achieve his fame and respect: he became a Baronet and Chancellor of his university; several of his plays were made into movies in the 1930s, and ""Peter Pan"" has been made into several movies and continues to be produced as stage shows and ballets. And who hasn't heard of Peter Pan Peanut Butter?<br/><br/>For a villainess, Julie Christie is up there with the good and believable ones. I also enjoyed her in ""Troy"" this year as Achilles' (Brad Pitt's) mother. Kate Winslet is always so divine; ""Titanic"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"" -- and now ""Finding Neverland"". I always have read that Barrie became guardian of her five (not four) sons, and with no mention of her mother with dual guardianship. The dog was a hoot, especially the actor portraying him.<br/><br/>A++"

","Finding no words to write is very bad for a reviewer! This is the situation I find myself in now! I have just been to neverland and back again to the real world but I shall never forget the path!<br/><br/>""Finding Neverland"" is one of very few movies that has touched the hearts of the Audience. The audience was in their seats even after 15 seconds ""The End"" was written on the screen. Then one by one we stood up and applauded. All of us was reluctant to leave the Neverland that we found.<br/><br/>Its the journey that Author JM Barrie took to find his finest play "" Peter Pan"" Johnny Depp was brilliant and convincing as the author. He might very well walk away with an Oscar this year. Kate Winslet is an wonderful actress and she has proved it yet again. Kate is Sylvia Davies mother to the four children based on whom Barrie has written the play. The supporting cast Radha Mitchell, Dustin Hoffman and Julie chistie also did justice to their roles. I would have loved to see Dustin Hoffman in an extended role but again we cant take story away from its roots can we? Four children are good and can expect them to be wonderful actors one day.<br/><br/>The story is about hope and imagination. How even in the woes of his loveless marriage and disaster of a play Barrie picks himself up to live his dreams. The screenplay is pure at heart and so often in film we are touched by it!<br/><br/>The only flaw in the movie is towards the middle when it looks like it is dragging. But soon the movie continues its good stride.<br/><br/>Marc Forster has made a beautiful masterpiece that will never get old in hearts of cinema lovers like me.<br/><br/>Please do watch the movie...

"babuon","8","0","0","22 November 2004"," An historically inaccurate but charming story of Jame Barrie's inspiration for Peter Pan
","This was a lovely film. Johnny Depp portrays writer James Barrie (best known as the creator of Peter Pan) as a gentle man who has never relinquished the little boy inside him. He could only have been an author and playwright so that his childlike self would have a home. And yet he was not totally naive - witness his decision to bring in orphaned children to the opening of Peter Pan.<br/><br/>The film was beautifully photgraphed -- the English theater, London Streets, parks and gardens, and country homes. Kate Winslett was charming, and Julie Christie was a very nice surprise. The real scene stealers, though, were the children -- those who were the inspiration for Barrie as well as the poor children invited to the opening whose faces were sheer delight. A little gem."

"artzau","9","0","0","20 November 2004"," Sensitive, brilliant movie
","Johnny Depp is one of those actors about whom there appears to be no middle ground. Folks either dislike him intensely or can't wait to get in to see his films. I must confess that since I fall into that latter category. I've not seen a film with him that I've not liked since Edward Scissorhands.<br/><br/>This one is no exception. It's just damn, fine theater. Peter Pan, the metaphor of the refusal of the adult to leave childhood behind,is in us all.<br/><br/>In this simple child's play, with its mixture of stereotyped characters, Indians, pirates, middle-class Englishmen, children and fairy creatures, you bounce from one archetype to another like a steel ball in a pinball game. So profound is this mythic journey, the man behind it all is completely forgotten. Enter Depp. Supported by a superb cast, exquisite scenery and a delightful script, we get a glimpse of that lonely Scott in his turn of the century sojourn. The story is great: a creative man, introspective and solitary, in a marriage with someone with quite different values, motives and ambitions, he wanders into a relationship with a family of grieving boys and their ailing mother, Blanchett, and becomes not only part of their world but conspires with them to help build his universe of fanciful imaginative invention. The story is a love story, albeit very restrained in a post-Victorian world and constrained by his own moral code. The romance is wrought with sentiment but never descends to the sentimental; his relationship with the boys bespeaks Barrie's own lost youth and touches on his loneliness and isolation. Christie as Blancett's powerhouse mother is always beautiful and wonderfully controlling. The four boys are delightful with serious little Peter capturing our hearts. The wonderful Dustin Hoffman is great as the man who had the faith in Barrie to give him the freedom to let the Peter Pan in all of us, fly away, out the window into the freedom of the Neverland of our imaginations."
"jdesando","Null","0","0","19 November 2004"," Another entertaining attempt to make genius accessible to us all.
","In 1903 London it is hard to believe any artist besides Oscar Wilde could have energized the West End more than J.M. Barrie with his immortal ""Peter Pan."" Finding Neverland"" attempts to tell how Barrie (Johnny Depp) was inspired through his relationship with widower Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four fatherless boys.<br/><br/>The replication of London and its play-going society is as perfect as we've grown to expect; see, for instance, ""Being Julia,"" which is also about the London stage and star Julia Lambert (Annette Bening), who blurs the line between her performances and her personal life. In a sense, that's what ""Neverland"" addresses: Barrie creating magical escape for children but losing the magic in his marriage, believing his wife and Sylvia would ever be there for him. Also, both films attempt to deal with the isolation genius brings and the ironic truth that the more success art brings, the more distance from reality and humanity is required for the creation.<br/><br/>Depp underplays Barrie to the extent that when he plays a pirate for the children, I longed for his swashbuckler in ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Even when he is deeply involved with the children, who are his muse along with their mother, he seems to be holding back the energy Barrie must have had or that Depp certainly has.<br/><br/>But enough sentimentality is loaded on to the last third of the film to sink the ""Titanic"" without glacial help. Sylvia's deadly consumption lets Forster indulge his actors with pithy statements about death and its antidote, the imagination. The heartstrings are pulled harder than the ropes elevating Pan and the boys on the stage. The literal translation of the Davies kid's actions into those of Pan, Wendy, and friends lacks the imagination of the author himself.<br/><br/>Depp remains today's most versatile actor, so when he underplays, as he does here, he is still interesting. 'Finding Neverland' is more engaging that his 'Secret Window,' where he also plays a writer troubled with his inspiration, and 'Neverland' this year joins 'De-Lovely'(Col Porter's life) as another entertaining attempt to make genius accessible to us all."

","I've got to say that I approached this film with some trepidation. The reviews weren't sparkling, but I've got to say that I found it quite a pleasant experience. <br/><br/>The film is about the eternal child that is J M Barrie who wrote Peter Pan. He befriends a widow, or more precisely, her children and builds the fantasy world that will eventually spawn Peter Pan. His wife is obviously somewhat skeptical about the relationship which drives Barrie further into his imaginary world.<br/><br/>This is very well acted and directed with a relatively slow pace which is very pleasing. Johny Depp rarely has an off day and he's on form again here. I've always find Kate Winslett alluring and she's also quite well (type)cast in her part. Well worth 7/10"

","As someone who didn't know the story of how the playwright J.M.Barrie came to write Peter Pan I found this story very interesting and thoroughly engrossing. I'm not sure to what extent the director has dramatised it, but I'm pretty sure J.M.Barrie wasn't as good-looking as his on-screen counter-part. Nonetheless this film has a sense of authenticity from start to finish. The film really captures the feel of Old England and J.M.Barries soft Scottish accent is finely tuned unlike his pseudo-cockney accent in Pirates of the Caribbean. The script is well-written, with only a few questionable lines, but the delivery of all the children in the film (bar the youngest one) is convincing. The main child actor in the film shines, and actually looks like I think Peter Pan would.<br/><br/>I think this film has something in it for everyone who has the patience to watch it and would definitely recommend it to people who enjoy drama/family film genres.<br/><br/>9/10"

"seaview1","Null","0","0","9 November 2004"," Believe in Finding Neverland
","If you truly believe, anything is possible, and that sums up the theme of Finding Neverland, a wonderful, emotional journey of the heart. Suggested by actual events at the turn of the century in England, the story follows James M. Barrie, the man who would go on to write Peter Pan. How he got to that creative place serves as the fascinating backdrop to a story about people who are drawn together and bond amid interesting circumstances.<br/><br/>There is a bull's eye performance by Johnny Depp as Barrie who by chance meets a widow Sylvia Davies (enchanting Kate Winslet) and her four young sons who have recently lost their father from cancer. A younger son, Peter, is the focal point of the growing relationship between Barrie and the family. Barrie's childlike fascination with the magic of believing and the innocence of children is a recurring theme. At his summer cottage, he develops the story and characters that will ultimately become Peter Pan. An added subplot is Barrie's own marriage which is in the throes of deterioration. As the plot reaches its finale, Peter Pan, the play is ready for its premiere and real-life relationships mature.<br/><br/>Despite a slow, deliberately paced beginning, the film manages to deposit bits of layers of feeling, motivation and pathos that by film's end result in a mountain of emotion and connection. There is indeed a magical feeling of wanting to believe amid the love Barrie feels for his adopted family. The feelings are not unlike the end of Field of Dreams or Big Fish, and that's a good thing. The final frame is not easily forgotten. <br/><br/>How dare Miramax produce an intelligent film that has no violence, profanity, or sex? Even the screenplay is well written (Allan Knee and David Magee) with memorable lines that ring true. Production values are strong including crisp cinematography and period costume/set designs. The film looks like 1903 without being in your face. The pacing is very deliberate and steady, and there is nice intercutting of Barrie's real world and his interspersed fantasy world. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp underplays the role of Barrie in a measured, subtle way without losing sight of the creative, unique self who stirred his creative juices and shared his vision with those closest to him. Constantly fascinating to watch, Depp has moments which recall his previous roles in Ed Wood and Pirates of the Caribbean. He is hitting his stride as a strong lead and acting force, and Oscar nominations are waiting for him and others in the cast. Kate Winslet is good as always and has had a great one-two punch this year with The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There is droll support from Dustin Hoffman as a theater producer who is given the best throwaway lines including a cute reference to his past role as Captain Hook in Spielberg's Hook. An older Julie Christie registers a strong supporting performance as Winslet's stern mother who dislikes Barrie's influence on her family. Special mention should go to Freddie Highmore who is terrific as the young Peter whose namesake serves as the title Barrie's masterpiece.<br/><br/>2004 is shaping up to be the year of the biopics what with De-Lovely, Ray, Beyond the Sea, Alexander, Kinsey, and Vera Drake among others. It would be safe to say that Finding Neverland is not only one of the best biography films but also one of the best films of the year. (Just be patient and let the magic do its work.)"

","I was fortunate enough to catch a preview of this last weekend. It is one of the most touching films I have ever seen. Both Depp and Winslet are excellent. Depp masterfully portrays J.M. Barrie as both a romantic and a realest. Truly a formidable task. The juxtaposition of childhood and adult themes throughout the film is acted by Depp with introspection and emotion. Peter Pan is about a boy who never wanted to grow up and Depp plays this coquettish nuance to the hilt. In many scenes it is almost like Depp is thinking both like a child and like an adult. He tries to imagine how life would be if maturity stopped at eleven years old. This is obviously one of the themes of the movie which I feel truly gives it an enduring quality. This film is like Peter Pan trying to come to grips with growing up, and bringing as much of Neverland with him as he could."

","Although this film is only based on the true story of J.M Barrie's friendship with the Llewellyn-Davis family (in reality the father was still alive when they met Mr. Barrie and later had a fifth son before succumbing to cancer), I loved the film nonetheless and was as easily seduced by the magic as the children in the film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gave a fantastic and restrained performance as the shy, soft-spoken Barrie who becomes a surrogate father for the Llewellyn-Davis family, much to the chagrin of his own social-climbing wife Mary, and just about everyone else in London society. Freddie Highmore, who plays the difficult Peter who mourns the loss of his father by growing up far too quickly, is a real talent who easily holds his own in scenes with Depp. In fact all four boys are convincing as Edwardian children who find themselves with a new playmate who can turn his dog into a bear simply by sharing his imagination.<br/><br/>While encouraging the real Peter to try his hand at writing about his brothers and their made-up adventures, Mr. Barrie find the inspiration to write about the boys himself, eventually creating what we would come to know as the play, ""Peter Pan."" Although the film states that Barrie himself is the true spirit of Peter Pan, in real life, the playwright said the character was an amalgam of all the Llewellyn-Davis boys rolled into one.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet plays the uncomplicated Sylvia Llewellyn-Davis who steadfastly stands by her friend Mr. Barrie no matter how much her mother (screen legend Julie Christie) complains. Miss Christie crackles on screen as the brittle society matron who's concerns for her daughter is overshadowed by her concern for what society thinks of this middle-aged man who plays with children all day.<br/><br/>In reality, there was more than just a little suggestion that Barrie was a closet pedofile and some point to a questionable line in one of his books where a character, a grown man, steels himself with liquor, announces to his young male charge that it is time for bed, and marvels at how it doesn't sound so dastardly when he says it. The Llewellyn-Davis boys who in real life became his adopted sons after Sylvia died of cancer, never alleged any wrong-doing however, and the film actually addresses the issue as a rumor that Barrie dismisses as, ""sick.""<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman has some of the best lines in the whole film as Mr, Barrie's dry-witted, grumbling producer who has faith that this writer will create a hit play and even keeps his actors on salary as a show of faith after Barrie's latest play was a flop. <br/><br/>This fanciful, funny and tear-inducing film is, ""just a bit of silliness,"" as young Peter might say. But as Mr, Barrie would reply, "" Oh, I hope so."""

Barrie (Johnny Depp), and details the experiences that lead him to write his classic tale. After his latest play bombs, Barrie finds inspiration through the children of a local woman who is left raising her 4 children after her husband's death. His special relationship with this family, and in particular one boy Peter, drives him to craft his story and create Neverland, a joyous and magical place. From their adventures through boyhood imagination, Barrie becomes an inspiration for those that inspire him the most.<br/><br/>Director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball) has crafted an entertaining and moving film. The pacing is deliberate and the emotion is honest. The way he jumps between reality and the world of imagination is a treat to watch. I also have to commend Forster for not letting the film become too sappy in the end.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives yet another terrific performance, delivering his lines with a Scottish accent that sounds both natural and convincing. His boyish looks help you to believe he is just a big kid, and his interactions with the boys are natural and sincere.<br/><br/>Kate Winslett's portrayal of a mother struggling to stay afloat is honest and full of emotion. She is a fine actress and this was a fine performance. It's no surprise that with 'Finding Neverland' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' Kate Winslett has appeared in two of the top three movies of 2004. She is a tremendous talent and is well utilized here.<br/><br/>Despite the strong performances by Depp and Winslett, young actor Freddie Highmore steals the show with his portrayal of Peter, a young boy who has grown up too quickly trying to cope with his father's death. This young man is special and I dare you not to be moved by his performance. The on screen relationship between the boy who refuses to stay young and the playwright who refuses to grow up, is captivating and a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, there wasn't a dry eye in the theater. I pinched myself on several occasions trying to detach myself from the emotion of the story. Never heavy handed, Finding Neverland aims for your heart, and scores a big hit. <br/><br/>mastercritic.com"

","There is only one word that i can think of which truly describes this film. That word is wow. <br/><br/>Prior to seeing this film, i had herd the reviews on the radio and friends told me what they thought of it. However, when i went to see the film earlier this evening, a friend asked me what i thought, but i was unable to tell her. I just didn't know what to tell her, I was truly speechless. there is no way that such magic could be put into a brief description.<br/><br/>There was no melodrama, no falseness, no ""why am i here?"". Throughout the film, the cinema was totally silent... no talking or giggling at all. i had a brief look around the screening room and everyone was staring intently at the screen, lost in the magic that is Finding Neverland.<br/><br/>There was not one thing that i could fault from the opening scene to the closing credits. The acting was above anything i had previously seen, the attention to detail was astounding and the direction of the movie was perfect. The actors did not seem forced and the performances seemed to come from the heart...Kate Winslet was Sylvia, dying but wanting to protect her children and not face the truth...Peter was a young boy trying to come to terms with the death of his father and johnny Depp was Barrie.<br/><br/>I have seen many films that would have been a total flop if it had not been for the talent of Johnny Depp and when i first heard of this project i sincerley hoped that this would not be the same. i can honestly say that it was not...taking any of the cast away would have taken the magic and sparkle from Finding Never Land.<br/><br/>I don't doubt that everyone in the cinema today did indeed find Neverland."

","I will admit, before I start, that I am not an entirely neutral reviewer. I am a fan of Johnny Depp's, mainly due to Pirates of the Caribbean. However, all my expectations of a couple of hours just paying attention to him and ignoring the story were completely contradicted by this film.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best I have seen in a while, and I visit the cinema regularly. It is a children's film, but any adult who doesn't go to see it because of that is missing out. The story keeps you entertained, with moments of humour lightening even the darkest scenes. The acting is excellent from both Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, and many reviewers have tipped Depp for an Oscar nomination. Despite this, Freddie Highmore, who plays the inspiration for Peter Pan, is probably the best actor in it-at 12 years old. He gives a touching performance, and wins the audience's heart.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the best thing about this film is not the actors, or the wonderful visuals, or the humour. It is the fact that this is a film that reminds us of the importance of believing.

","Before I give this review, I probably should just mention that I am a major Peter Pan/J.M. Barrie freak who knows far too much trivia on both subjects. I promise not to nit pick. Now on with the review: Finding Neverland is a film inspired by the events that lead to and followed the creation of the play/book Peter Pan. The part of the Scottish playwright James Barrie was handled masterfully by none other than Johnny Depp. Equally well done was the performance of Kate Winslet as Sylvia Davies, the woman whose four sons were the original ""Lost Boys"". Julie Christie creates a very human antagonist as Sylvia's overbearing mother. Dustin Hoffman also brings in a comical presentation as the producer of Barrie's plays, who thinks that Peter Pan is the most ridiculous thing everÂ…but produces it anyway. This movie, despite the sad events that take place, is not as depressing as it may seem. There's plenty of humor to balance out the more heavy topics. Barrie's conversations with the boys are very clever. Setting aside all of the historical inaccuracies which the descendents of the Davies family are currently up in arms about (for example, the killing off of Mr. Davies before the movie even begins and slightly changing the first meeting between Barrie and Sylvia Davies), this is a wonderful (not using the term loosely) tale of how imagination can be like medicine. The use of constant fantastical imagery (although a technique used before to tell the story of famous authors and artists) paints the perfect picture of the relationship Barrie created with the Davies family. It shows how the games they played became the tale of boy who would not grow up and gives insight on how the mind of an author works when they take from life. These scenes of fancy are done with obvious costumes and paper backdrops, making sure the audience understands that they are coming from the mind of a playwright. Although focusing a little too much on Peter Davies, whose emotional trauma turns annoying every now and again, everyone is portrayed with dignity. There is no bitterness at growing up given in the movie either, similar to the way growing up is discussed in the original Peter Pan story. When Barrie realizes that the eldest boy, George, has suddenly become a young man he's proud, not upset. The 'love story' is done in a subtle manner, exactly how it would have been if Barrie was in love with Mrs. Davies. The failing relationship he has with his wife in the film is also touched upon in a way that is very human, not a theatrical soap opera. Even the scandal that hangs over the tale today, involving the questioning of this married man who spent all of his time with a widow and four young boys, was mentioned in a way that did not make it the focus of the movie. Nor was the main plot about the birth of Peter and Wendy. Instead, the film makers chose to keep the attention on the lives of the characters and most specifically on the way Barrie shared his pretend haven, Neverland, with Sylvia and the boys. Some fun things you may enjoy while watching are Barrie's brief conversations with a friend named Arthur (who is in fact supposed to be Sir Arthur Conan Doyle), the short mutterings of Dustin Hoffman's character, and of course the constant toss between reality and the imaginary games Barrie, Sylvia, and the boys play. Setting aside all of my nit picks which I shall not mention since they would spoil the feeling of admiration the story leaves you with, I most certainly had to say this was a great film. I command you all to go see it."

","The movie itself it well written and the actors perfrom up to their expected standards. However it does not capture the attention of the audience very well in the beginning.

It presents a dramatic aspect as the characters must work to achieve their goals and work out their problems that they face in the event of a husbund remaining faithful to his wife but is never home. Overall the movie is not a ""bad"" movie and that term is used is a loose context because there are aspects of the movie that are very well done. The part of the movie that is probably going to be the best is that the ending is not a formulated Hollywood ending, it has a somewhat surprise ending that does not follow the usual format for ending for this type of move.

"iainwatson","Null","0","0","1 November 2004"," Bring back rock-n-roll Johnny!
","'Finding Neverland' is the story of how JM Barrie (played by Johnny Depp) was inspired to write the children's classic 'Peter Pan'. Barrie is an unhappily married playwrite who meets Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, a widowed society woman (played by Kate Winslet), and her 4 sons in the park. Barrie becomes a surrogate uncle to the boys, and finds himself drawn towards Sylvia.<br/><br/>It's a perfectly pleasant affair with good performances all round. Depp does a passable Scottish accent (not a Dumfries one though!), and Winslet is lovely as always. The film is ideally suited to those over 50 who have fond memories of Pan. I found myself yawning through most of it, as the story is rather boring. I know Depp is trying to have some sort of mainstream success at the moment and is making films that his children can watch, but I long for a return to the Depp of 'Ed Wood', 'Blow' and 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. Bring back Rock-n-Roll Johnny! The campaign starts here!<br/><br/>My problem with the film is that I have never found the story of 'Peter Pan' interesting, even as a child. I always thought the story was for posh middle-class English kids who liked visiting mummy and daddies country retreat in the summers and pretend to be pirates. Most people of my age I've spoken to hold the same opinion too. I think one of the main reasons for this is that my generation was far more concerned with the future than the past, our great story was 'Star Wars', and we all wanted to be astronauts, not pirates. Today's children might have a hard time relating too, as most of them want to be celebrities... Pop stars or actors. With the prolification of video, on-demand internet and computer games the imagination that is so greatly relied on in 'Peter Pan' is now in it's death-throes, barely clinging on via grandparents stories of what it was like before Nintendo and Pokemon.<br/><br/>'Finding Neverland' is Miramax's great Oscar hope. The film has been receiving great plaudits from the film bibles such as Empire (which awarded it a five star review), and word of mouth from an older audience should help it perform reasonably well at the box office. Depp may be in with a nomination chance again this year at the Oscars, and I do hope he wins as he can then go back to starring in the films that we all actually want to see him in."

","With a wonderful cast, great direction and plot line, the visually lovely Finding Neverland is a movie for both children and adults to watch -undoubtedly much moreso for the latter. The film is moving and inspirational without being sentimental or manipulative, and surely Johnny Depp's performance and Mark Forster's direction will garner award buzz. Watch out for Freddie Highmore's surprisingly precocious and sad Peter Davies -perhaps another Paquin.<br/><br/>The movie deals with the socially constructed rigid identities of child and adult, the theme, of course, in J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. It unravels the story of how Barrie (Depp) finds the inspiration for his story through his interactions with the Davies children. To play to this point, director Forster subtly interweaves special effects to ""real"" moments, paying tribute to the quiet beauty of the imagination."

","Rarely am I moved by a movie as I was by ""Finding Neverland."" Johnny Depp transcends his ""oddball character"" stereotype. I thought no other of his performances would surpass his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, but his sweetly endearing portrayal of J. M. Barrie, while very different, is its equal. He has a marvelous supporting cast, and young Freddie Highmore could easily have stolen the movie right out from under him, but Depp is so convincing as Barrie that one actually forgets that one is watching ""The Sexiest Man Alive"" and sees only Barrie; Depp once again submerges himself so deeply into the character that he disappears and only the character remains. One of the most moving moments of the film comes when Barrie explains how he came to create Neverland for himself. Depp handles the moment without sentimentality, but one feels the pain of the child James Barrie and begins to understand the adult Barrie's reasons for creating such an active fantasy life. As young Peter Davies states, Depp/Barrie IS Peter Pan."

","""Finding Neverland"" brilliantly and passionately chronicles the enchanting and fascinating identity of James R. Barrie, the imagineer behind one of the most inspirational children fantasies, Peter Pan. The film deftly explores Barrie's many personal inspirations behind the making of his ""Peter Pan"", as his experiences with Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her adorable, remarkable children become the dominant subjects of Barrie's ideas, fantasies, and emotions. Take a critical look inside the mind behind the magic of ""Neverland"", and you will discover that his personal background was every bit as human, endearing, and enchanting as is professed in the ""fairy tale"", Peter Pan: Barrie is fascinated by the prospect of dreams becoming reality, and his life's strife is to somehow bequeath his wonderful, magical outlook on life's whims and wonders into the lives of naive souls who might become better developed in life because of these unfettered hopes and dreams. Johnny Depp perfects a curious Scottish accent to lend his versatile, imaginative personality to the magical architect, in a way that is greatly studied of perhaps the man Barrie strove to be, and passionate in exploring his many emotions, turmoils, and aspirations towards life and exploring the realms of possibility: one will notice that Depp seems to have provided a lot of study and calculation of Barrie in acting as convincingly passionate as Barrie really was, in his remarkably adept and human portrayal of this remarkably human character. This is definitely an Oscar-worthy performance, and Depp is so brilliant and enchanting in portraying this mystifying imagineer that if it weren't for an ""allusion"" to his recent Jack Sparrow in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (he briefly, in imagination plays ""vicious pirate"" with the children), one would conclude that Barrie was the only role he was born to play: talk about a talented and versatile actor! Kate Winslet, through most of the film, is much dissociated with the theme in her role as Sylvia, yet distinctly grows into a real character as the film progresses, an important subject to Barrie's heart and soul, and delivers a fine, genuine performance as this tragically disparaged, yet cherished, woman. As a film, this is essentially a ""theater"" of exploration, into the depths of heart and soul, and how it is sometimes best to ""keep pretending forever"" in order to elude the disparities of life, as Barrie apparently realized in his beloved ""Peter Pan"". This was a man who cherished the wondrous fruits of life, in finding companionship and inspiration with innocence (with the children, particularly Peter, who is inspired to challenge his surroundings to develop into his manhood), and realizing it is essential that life accept the notion that to ""never grow up"" and retain your imagination and innocence in life is to truly experience your hopes and dreams, in flying to escape to an imaginary world, say, known as Neverland. Perhaps ""Finding Neverland"" is at times overly sentimental in its message and overly fantastic in exploring the realms of James Barrie (sometimes lingering two heavily on fragmented social themes), yet it is precisely adroit in bringing the ""theater of Barrie's heart, mind, and soul"" into the conscience of today's demure audience, who have perhaps yet to realize the spirit of this remarkable, fascinating imagineer who realized the essentials and realities in life through acquaintance, discovery, and experience: courage, aspiration, tragedy, development, happiness forever. ***1/2 out of ****"

","I had the great fortune to attend a preview showing of the latest Johnny Depp movie, Finding Neverland, tonight. And it is Johnny Depp's movie. However, others balance his presence, making this more of an ensemble project than many of his others. The children in particular drew me into the story, loosely based on JM Barrie's life and the creation of the play Peter Pan. It really is a wonderful script, full of nuance and discovery. Of course the English landscape is lush, but interior sets and costumes equal its splendor. The play-within-a-movie concept allows for some beautiful shots of scenery in action in a pre-electronic age. But it really all comes down to Barrie's confident innocence in interaction with all the other characters to make the movie stand out from the lot. His failing marriage, his attraction to a young widowed mother of four boys, his engagement of those boys to retrieve them from grief and the eventual emotional struggle with their grandmother -- each is a well-prepared and choreographed thread woven into a fine, warm fabric. It binds the story but allows enough light through to illuminate the magic. The only flaw, a major one overcome only by judicious use of non-speaking scenes in the last half-hour of the movie, is Dustin Hoffman's apparent inability to adopt a convincing British accent. As Barrie's producer and the owner of the theater, he begins the movie with an inoffensive affectation but ends up sounding as if he were an international investor from Brooklyn. It throws off the continuity. I would hope that, before wide release in two weeks, the director either dubs in a new voice or edits in missing footage explaining Hoffman's American background. Actually, I was surprised at this obvious error in an otherwise good performance. It truly is a magical movie and one that should garner multiple Oscar nominations and, probably, statues. I left the theater at the end wanting to take home the DVD. Warning: bring Kleenex."

","Johnny Depp has been having a very good year. An Academy Award nomination for his role of Jack Sparrow in The Pirates of the Caribbean, voted one of the sexiest men alive in almost every newsstand magazine in 2003 and he even beat out such Hollywood heavyweights as Steve Martin, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken for the title role in Tim Burton's highly anticipated remake of Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Johnny Depp has been having a very good year. <br/><br/>So, with the world his oyster, Depp opted for Finding Neverland, the story of Peter Pan author J.M. Barrie in a film that supposes his experiences and influences in writing the famous children's adventure. <br/><br/>Directed by Marc Forster as his follow-up to the widely raved Monster's Ball (2001), Finding Neverland is an enchanting tale that details the life of J.M. Barrie and his relationship with a lower classed family headed by Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet) who is left to rear four children after the death of her husband to cancer. Finding inspiration through each of the four children, Barrie seems to draw particularly on young son Peter (Freddie Highmore) who has been forced to grow up beyond his years due to the death of the father and the illness that befalls mother Sylvia. Through the sad eyes of Peter, Barrie dreams up the details of Neverland  a place where children can go and never grow old, and asks the young lad for permission to use this name as the title character of the elaborate play.<br/><br/>There is not a lot going on in Finding Neverland and its simplistic approach to storytelling is greatly appreciated. There are the leering eyes of the community as Barrie spends more time with the children that with his own wife. There is the theatre owner (played by Dustin Hoffman who ironically played Captain Hook in Steven Spielberg's 1991 misguided effort, Hook) who continues to believe in Barrie even as his plays continue to weaken in content with each new opening. And where would a story lead if not for a villain, in this case, played by Sylvia's mother who thinks of Barrie's involvement with the family as intrusive and undermining. However, much to the writers and director's credit, none of these tributaries are distracting and in fact, they push the story closer and closer to the inevitable conclusion.<br/><br/>At the screening there were countless families  young children aged 6-8 and I would suggest to parents that this is not a movie which will keep them entertained for any length of time. Although there is no violence and stronger language can be found on any SpongeBob Squarepants episode, there is nothing really there for the young tots either. The film tries to tackle serious topics such as societal pressure, marital relationships and the death of a parent and although it might have a Peter Pan backdrop for a script, it is probably too heavy handed for the youngins on the family.<br/><br/>For those of us that are old enough to enjoy a period piece about an author set in early 20th century London, you are in for a real treat. The film is sweet yet powerful and Depp puts in yet another convincing performance nailing a foreign accent without the distraction of say Tom Hanks in The Terminal. Although the ending might seem hokey and reminded me too my of the Michael Keaton film My Life, it still was a rewarding experience that I would recommend to just about anyone over the age of 20 and certainly for anyone who ever thought about what it would be to remain a child forever.

You will fall in love with precious Freddie Highmore--easily stealing many scenes, and he is a formidable match with Johnny Depp. No wonder Depp fought for him to play Charlie in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Finally, Johnny Depp is absolutely grand and believable as Barrie, mastering an accent, and using minimal makeup. He adds the perfect blend of childlike twinkle while also handling the adult role. If he is not in the Oscar race for Best Actor, I will be absolutely stunned, and I can usually pick them.<br/><br/>While this sounds like some mush-melon review, it is not really supposed to be anything more than to praise the movie for what it is. I didn't really even want to see this movie, and I ended up loving it, which is rare for me.<br/><br/>Anyway--go see it--you'll be glad you did!!"

","A curious cross between a pewiod dwama about repressed, moustachioed Edwardians, and a twinkly paean to the imagination of little kiddywinks.<br/><br/>Though beautifully filmed throughout, the latter episodes (accompanied by tinselly music) are so cringingly saccharine that at times I wondered if the film was aimed at an audience of five-year olds. Yet the other themes of infidelity, disease and death seemed strangely inappropriate for tiny tots.<br/><br/>But then it all made sense: surrounding me in the cinema were hordes of old age pensioners, who though unaccustomed to such new-fangled forms of entertainment, could relate perfectly to being a tiny tot in Edwardian times, being almost of that generation. And so they found the film delightful.<br/><br/>I, still having full command of my faculties, was not so keen, though in time I hope my toes will uncurl without surgical intervention."
"MovieAddict2016","6","2","5","27 April 2005"," An enjoyable yet flawed biopic, with a fantastic lead performance worthy of a higher quality motion picture
","Although ""Finding Neverland"" is a fine biopic of Peter Pan creator J.M. Barrie (played by Johnny Depp), it is also fairly standard in regards to the method it uses to approach the formulaic biopic; I got the feeling I had seen something like this before. The emotional moments all rang true but they still seemed eerily similar to other films of the genre.<br/><br/>However the lead performance by Johnny Depp is truly marvelous and he deserved an Oscar more than Clint Eastwood, at least in my humble opinion. It's hard enough to act as well as he does in this film; perfecting the accent is even harder. And he does both equally, exceedingly well.<br/><br/>The cast all do their best. It's nice to see Julie Christie back on the screen again and Kate Winslet, although fitting, didn't make a huge impression as I'd seen her play similar roles in the past. The most visible casting oddity has to be Dustin Hoffman; I couldn't tell if he was playing an Englishman or an American. His accent was uneven and role seemed strangely out-of-place, as if they cast him only for the sake of irony. (Some might recall he played Captain Hook in Steven Spielberg's ""Hook."")<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie but it was not the most original film to come out of Hollywood in recent years. Like many biopictures it follows the same sort of formula - I hate to call it ""sappy"" because that sounds demeaning, but it's somewhat true.<br/><br/>For example, although it's a true story, the film still manages to exaggerate all the right moments in order to tug on the audience's heartstrings; the effect is somewhat manipulative and definitely ""glossed over."" <br/><br/>Overall ""Finding Neverland"" is different from the Peter Pan stories we are familiar with, and remains fairly truthful to J.M. Barrie's life. Johnny Depp is superb and the film is amusing and worth seeing. It is not, however, what I would call a ""masterpiece,"" nor is it one of a kind. But it's still good and better than a lot of the stuff that came out last year."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","2","5","13 January 2005"," Wow.
","In 1998 there was some serious controversy over the Best Picture Oscar, which was a toss-up between Saving Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love. My position was that while Saving Private Ryan is inarguably one of the greatest war films ever made, Shakespeare in Love was a historical epic that managed to tell an in-depth story about Shakespeare's life that is not necessarily historically accurate, but accurate as far as what very little is known about Shakespeare himself. It was a story that was built upon theories of what may have happened in his life to lead him to write the plays that he wrote, and the movie took us back to that time in his life and told an incredible story which makes perfect sense as far as the content of his plays. It was almost like time travel the connections were so sharp. Finding Neverland takes something of the same tactic, tying in people from J.M. Barrie's life to the characters that he created in his plays.<br/><br/>Granted, this took place in the early 20th Century and not the early 17th Century, as in Shakespeare's case, and much more is know about Barrie's life than Shakespeare's, but the film tells such a moving and beautiful story that it reinvents the Peter Pan legend, which has by now become such an enduring classic that it almost seems like the vast majority of people alive today grew up on it. It brightened the childhoods of innumerable people, and this brilliant film breathes new life into the story.<br/><br/>I've heard numerous criticisms of the film that I don't care to acknowledge or dignify, and surely there are countless reviewers and critics who think they're clever by pointing out the connection between the title of the movie and Michael Jackson's recent lawsuits. I've seen and heard many such comments, and I am always struck by what an efficient method it is for a person to cheapen a great movie and, at the same time, to clearly illustrate their own intellectual shallowness and utter lack of anything important or interesting to say.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp fits flawlessly into the role of Barrie, a man who struggled to make a career as a playwright writing plays that he thought the lawyers and doctors in his audience wanted to see, before finally just writing what he believed in with the people in mind that he wanted to entertain  children. He was indeed a pioneer of children's literature, which is why it comes as a surprise to me that people are so quick to jump to conclusions about his interest in children and their entertainment. He was a child at heart, and the children saw him as one of their own. One of the first things that I learned when I studied Children's Literature at the University level was that it is adults, NOT children, that impose sexual meaning onto children's stories. Countless examples can be found in Alice in Wonderland, for example, and have also tarnished the reputation of Walt Disney himself.<br/><br/>Classics of children's literature invariably come from people who spend the majority of their time concerned with entertaining children, and I'm thrilled to see that there are still major filmmakers and actors who can see that and look beyond things like the Michael Jackson scandals, which themselves may or may not be true. Personally, I think it is at least as likely that Michael Jackson is either completely insane and literally thinks he's a child himself or that he harbors the same interest in children that Barrie did, which was a completely harmless connection with his inner child, something that the vast majority of adults in the world could use more of.<br/><br/>I heard of a study that concluded that children smile something like 200 times a day, while adults smile something like six times a day. That's exactly the kind of thing about which a movie like Finding Neverland is designed to remind us all. When we meet Barrie he is pacing backstage at the opening night of one of his plays, which turns out to be a tremendous flop. He's sitting in the park not long after, mulling over his failed effort, and meets the boys about which his classic play Peter Pan ultimately becomes based upon.<br/><br/>The adventures that Barrie and these boys, as well as their mother, have, become the fascinating tour through the life of one of the most creative and fascinating minds in literary history. Finding Neverland is a biography, of sorts, and while the term Inspired by True Events may be the one that describes a story that is based very loosely on a true story, any creative liberties taken with Barrie's life serve only to make his story into more of a captivating fairy tale than it might otherwise have been. The conclusion of the film, for example, where Neverland appears in the boys' house to the wondrous delight of their sick mother is unlikely, but rarely are creative liberties taken with greater success. The only dry eyes in the house, as they say, will indeed be found in the heads of the audience members who display the same bitter frigidness as the grandmother in this movie.<br/><br/>And here is the most interesting thing about the way the movie is structured and designed  If you find yourself completely unmoved by it, then it is you that the movie is designed to inspire.<br/><br/>Bravo."

The script just seemed rushed and the movie moved way to fast to began to like any of the characters. I didn't get teared eyed when kate's character died because I didn't feel that her and Depp developed enough chemistry for there to be ""love"". The movie rushed to fast for that.

","This is a very sweet film, and enjoyable. But for the life of me I do not know how it could have snagged a Best Picture and Best Actor nomination over KINSEY and its outstanding leading performance by Liam Neeson, who was totally robbed. Maybe from the general public, but the industry that votes on these awards should know better. Furthermore, it makes no sense that critics dismissed THE NOTEBOOK as ""schmaltzy"" while this film that milks the tearful eyes of Freddie Highmore for all they're worth was given a pass on the schmaltz-o-meter. Come on! The film doesn't pick up until the production of Peter Pan is underway. Up to that point, it drags, and there is little conflict to keep us interested other than what's bubbling beneath the surface in good performances by Radha Mitchell (as Mrs. Barrie) and a superbly surly Julie Christie.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance is good, but not the phenomenon that he was in POTC. He's well cast. But is he better than Neeson, or the Oscar-snubbed Paul Giamatti, Kevin Kline (De-Lovely), Javier Bardem, or Tom Hanks (The Ladykillers)? Not this time, I'd say.<br/><br/>Yes, there are magical elements of the film that make it all worthwhile, but the way it is set up to unfold so predictably is a noticeable flaw that slightly dulls the shine of the wonderful parts."

","A wonderful movie. When has Johnny Depp let you down? A very interesting story about the famed Scottish playwright J.M. Barrie trying to rebound from a stinker of a play that disappointed Edwardian English society. Unlikely inspiration comes from a stroll in London's Kensington Gardens, where Barrie strikes a friendship with a group of young boys and their charming mother Sylvia Llewelyn Davies(Kate Winslet). As this relationship deepens, Barrie garners enough inspiration to write his most noted work 'Peter Pan'. The building emotions between James and Sylvia is touching and heartfelt. FINDING NEVERLAND can be enjoyed by the entire family.<br/><br/>Depp is in his element and Winslet is graceful as she is beautiful. Radha Mitchell should not be overlooked as Barrie's unhappy wife Mary Ansell. Other standouts: Dustin Hoffman, Freddie Highmore, Kelly Macdonald and Julie Christie."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","1","2","2 August 2006"," Neat, nice and very emotional - pulling at the human race's collective heartstrings
","I think that 'Peter Pan' is a story so classical and so embedded in our hearts, that a film dealing with the man behind the works and the boys who inspired his imagination, is just bound to touch you.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland proves me right in this. It bravely plunges into the whimsical imagination land of J.M Barrie (Johnny Depp), documenting his life and experiences in the year that he wrote the play Peter Pan -- the boy who never grew up. Moreover, we follow Barrie as he develops a strong bond with a family of a mother (Kate Winslet) and her four lively boys. These are the charismatic, nuanced characters who inspire the author to write, feel and believe.<br/><br/>Marc Forster's Finding Neverland is a quiet, somewhat flawed, masterpiece. I say 'quiet' because it is not a film that revolutionizes anything or completely blows you away - it is a lovely little piece that warms your heart. It features a uniformly strong cast, a cute storytelling technique and overall satisfying developments in the plot which is kept focused by assured direction.<br/><br/>Although it is deeply emotional most often in a classy kind of way, Finding Neverland falls prey to the cheesy Hallmark moment approach on one or two occasions, and you feel that it sometimes jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely. This is mainly in regards to Sylvia's frosty authoritative mother who goes through the clichéd character developments (I won't spoil anything here, but you can guess it). I suppose I fell victim to this however, seeing as how I cried uncontrollably for nearly the entire second half.<br/><br/>I noticed something interesting about this film; the format in which it was shot is different from anything I've ever seen, appearing just a bit more colorful than the average blockbuster -- sharp colour contrasts, seemingly highlighting each detail. This is a nice colourful touch to an already colourful film. A strong 7/10."

Interesting touches, like the hook on the grandmother's hand, and the references made throughout the movie to characters from the play. What I was astounded by was how this movie resisted to show any sexual attraction between James and Sylvia. Most movies would leap at the chance to show two characters giving in to their ""yearnings and burnings,"" but this movie showed how powerful true love can be between friends.<br/><br/>Every artist must suffer, or his work is not counted as art, and Barrie went through trials with ridicule from the public, as well as lack of support from his wife. The scene where she is scouring through his journal in hopes of finding a confession of a possible affair was just dynamic. She wants to be a part of his world, and yet she doesn't know how.<br/><br/>And James explaining how he was forced to grow up early to comfort his grieving mother illuminates the origin of Neverland. He brings Neverland to his friend. And that was truly magical."

Right down to the style of the waves in the make believe ocean when Peter is forced to walk the plank (yes, that is how it was really done in that style of theater... cutout waves on sticks manipulated by stagehands with a whale jumping through...), the whole movie just sings. And that is no pun.<br/><br/>Depp's portrayal of J.M. Barrie should be ranked up there with anything Barrymore, Olivier, Huston or Flynn ever imagined doing. It is tender, touching, youthful and what's more believable. He brought ""Peter pan"" to life from the lives of 5 boys. If you read the ""true"" backstory, it isn't nearly as dramatic as the movie makes out, but that's okay. The point is well taken.<br/><br/>This movie belongs in any collection of any true videophile.

","I don't quite remember when I first knew about Peter Pan story. I know I had listened to a children songs cassette my father bought us when I was a child, and one of the song is about Peter Pan. But at that time I didn't really know the story. Peter Pan is a classic and very popular tale, and had been filmed several times, including Hook, and the most recent Peter Pan. Disney also has the animated version. But to tell you the truth, until now I haven't watched all of them, and I also never read the full story of Peter Pan.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland, tells the story of James M. Barrie, the writer of Peter Pan. James lives as a play writer, and his play is shown in a theater in London. His plays begin to be criticized as bad. And he apparently doesn't have a nice relationship with his wife, either. Until one day he meets with a family which consists of a widow and four children. The widow, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, has lost his husband, and she's having quite a hard time taking care of her children. Sylvia has a hard tempered mother, who after Sylvia's husband's death, is constantly trying to interfere with her family life.<br/><br/>James is somewhat attracted to this family, especially the children, and a child in particular, Peter, who is suffered the most from his father's death. James often visits their house, or travels with them together, and being a very imaginative writer, he quickly forms a strong bond with the kids. In the middle of James' relationship with the Davies', his marriage is on the edge of breaking, and he also must face Sylvia's mother who obviously doesn't like James' presence in the family. Yet in this situation, he finally gets an inspiration for a new play. And that is how this play, Peter Pan, is born.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland is a nice and very touching drama. Johnny Depp portrays James Barrie well, though I don't think his performance can be considered amazing, except maybe his convincing English accent. But overall, his 2003's Jack Sparrow was more memorable. On the other hand, Freddie Highmore, who plays Peter, delivers an impressive acting. The other children most of the time simply fall flat. Kate Winslet is nice, and Julie Christie is great as Sylvia's mother. Dustin Hoffman gets a tiny role as the theater owner. This is quite funny, because he played Captain Hook in Hook.<br/><br/>There are many memorable lines in this film, maybe most of them are spoken by James. The film's score is beautifully done, while not too melodramatic, either. The visuals are also great, so are the effects, which are needed to provide the audience some clues about James' imagination, particularly the imagination that is connected with Peter Pan. The play on the theater is performed well, with nice theater construction design, and nice stage decoration.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland is about finding your Neverland. The question is, what does our Neverland look like? Each person will have his own point of view. It will depend on our own imagination, or our own beliefs, our own faith. One thing that's certain, believing in something, may have a significant impact to our life."

Heres the plot spoiler- Sylvia becomes extremely ill, claiming its just a chest cold, so she remains bedridden for the debut of James' (what the J stands for in JM Barrie) new masterpiece, Peter Pan. But, being the great man he is, James brings the play to Sylvia in a magical display of happiness on Neverland where James and Sylvia can escape to. Truly magical. But the happiness cannot go on forever and Sylvia dies. sad but, ill say it yet again, magical."
"HardKnockLife210","8","1","2","8 January 2005"," A Movie with an Imagination All Its Own
","Imagination is the fuel of movies. From the most light-hearted of animated features to the grimmest of human tragedies, it is imagination that creates the characters and the stories. But what about the films regarding the subject of imagination? Most of them are filled with cheesy dialogue and songs about love, but Finding Neverland is, shall we say, a horse of a different color.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland is the story of playwright J.M. Barrie, and the manner in which his famous play Peter Pan came into being in the early 1900s. The story revolves around Barrie and his ""adventures"" with a widow and her four sons. Barrie is played by Johnny Depp with a subtlety that shows the full range of Depp's acting skill. Whereas a movie about a playwright with great imagination could have been a loud, comedic affair, Depp stays quiet and sincere. Kate Winslet as Mrs. Davies, the widow, is somewhat overshadowed by Depp's performance, but her own performance is good in its own right. Most surprisingly, the four young sons do a decent acting job, rarely ever seeming forced in their dialogue.<br/><br/>The film is also directed quite well by Marc Forster as the scenes travel between Barrie's imagination and reality. The blend of these two elements is close to perfection, as fantasy is contrasted sharply with harsh reality. Also, Jan A.P. Kaczmarek's score has gotten some buzz, and the buzz is well-deserved. True, the melodies of the score don't remain in one's mind after the film has ended, but that is merely because the rest of the film is so captivating.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, I'm thankful that Finding Neverland didn't collapse into a stereotypical Disney-esquire film. In fact, during the end credits, no tacky song about imagination is to be heard. However, the film does not totally escape the horrible dialogue found in other films of the sort like, ""your imagination can take you anywhere,"" and various pathetic nonsense of the sort. My only other complaint regards the film's beginning, which catapults Barrie so quickly into an intimate relationship the Davies family, that the viewer barely has time to catch his breath and finds himself in a state of disbelief that such a relationship could develop so quickly.<br/><br/>Overall, this one's worth your time due to some great performances, pleasing direction, and avoidance, for the most part, of stereotypical imagination material.<br/><br/>Final Grade: B+."
"NoArrow","7","1","2","3 January 2005"," Good, but too simple, definitely not one of the year's best
","""Finding Neverland"" is a lot like ""Ray"", though not as good. They are both about men whose childhoods are practically destroyed by family tragedy but who create something magical and long-lasting in their adult lives, through the influence of others. ""Ray"" was about a very influential black singer; ""Finding Neverland"" is about the writer of ""Peter Pan"". Both premises could've been made into great movies. But, strangely, only ""Ray"" was great.<br/><br/>Oh, ""Finding Neverland"" was good, but it was just too simple too be even compared to many of this year's movies, including ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"", ""Collateral"", ""The Passion of the Christ"", ""Closer"" and ""The Life Aquatic"". Not to say simple movies aren't as good as complex ones, but the solutions this movie offers seems a lot more geared for children than adults, or even all-ages. I'm wondering if this is on purpose, because the film is essentially a bio-pic, and bio-pics are generally not one of children's basic genres.<br/><br/>Of course I may be alone on this, everyone else seems to love it, but I find it very surprising that this film could inspire any form of adult. Its main message is ""with your imagination you can accomplish anything"", which we've all heard, since we were very young, from many sources. Of course maybe it takes a simple little movie to remind you of it.<br/><br/>So the Scottish Sir James Barrie (Johnny Depp) has writer's block, and his last play was a flop, and his impresario (Dustin Hoffman) is getting skeptical. His wife Mary Ansell (Radha Mitchell) is a little distant  he is not least at fault  and he spends his days sitting in the local park, writing in his notebook. One day he finds that a little boy is lying under his shoe, and then he meets the boys' brothers, and widow mother, Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies (Kate Winslet). Immediately he is smitten with the family, but not romantically, mind you. No, in a way Sir Barrie wants to be the boys' brother, and Sylvia's son.<br/><br/>But some people get in the way: Sylvia's mother, Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie), Mary, and one of Sylvia's sons Peter (Freddie Highmore) are all fiercely against the union of James and the Davies family. Of course, to everyone but James, Sylvia and the other boys their time together looks scandalous and, well, creepy, but they understand that they are all just a big, happy family.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is skillful in playing characters that are in their own element  actually, come to think of it, all of his leading characters have some strange quirk that puts them in their own world. An android with sharp hands, an illiterate Buster Keaton fan, the worst film director of all time, one of the best drug dealers of all time, a drunken fruity pirate, a deadly CIA agent, and a shadowy authortake your pick. All of them completely different, except for the similarity of being one hundred percent unique. And now another to add to the list: Sir J.M. Barrie. This character's quirky curse is that his childhood was all but stolen from him (for reasons I wont spoil), and so he spends his adult life trying to steal it back. Yes, indeed, there is no romance between James and Sylvia, because at the age James is really at, girls to him are a still unfamiliar being who are there to look nice and clean (which makes his wedding with Mary a complete mystery). But James has still the wisdom and experience of an adult, so he seems less like he has a problem than a cute quirk. Johnny Depp balances this perfectly, it's a great performance.<br/><br/>But not as great as that of Liam Neeson, Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, Paul Giamatti or Bill Murray. I seriously think this film is being over-praised. Depp was great, but not amazing, and most of the rest of the cast is underused  especially Hoffman  though Radha Mitchell shines. The movie itself isn't really a mass achievement eithersure, the costumes, sets and cinematography were great, but I think all that should be second to the writing and direction, which, I'm sad to say, isn't all that great. And there's an awkward scene at the end with Winslet, in her house, that would work a lot better as a dream or some sort of fantasy.<br/><br/>So it's not a must-see, but you would enjoy parts if you watched it, and Depp and Mitchell turn in some good work, so I won't discourage you from seeing it. Just watch the other movies I mentioned first.<br/><br/>7/10."
"sjmcollins-1","7","1","2","1 January 2005"," Liked it
","The big Oscar push has been on for Johnny Depp in Finding Neverland, and while I've seen better male lead performances this year, Depp still gives a fine performance as J.M. Barrie, and the movie itself ends up being very heartwarming. The movie focuses on the inspiration gained by Barrie to write Peter Pan, and a fine ensemble cast led by Kate Winslet helps to show how Barrie gained a family along with a great play, regaining a sense of childhood innocence along the way. Neverland is more closely associated with Michael Jackson these days, and a reference to a similar scandal is hinted at about halfway through the film, but quickly brushed aside. I had a bit of a problem picking up Depp's dialogue at times, he seemed to fall to much into the accent, but it wasn't enough to be a major distraction."
"talair2000","10","1","2","1 January 2005"," A touching look at creative Inspiration and dealing with loss
","First of all it's NOT A BIOGRAPHY, and doesn't pretend to be! It is about finding inspiration for creativity and how it can help deal with loss. I found it to be perfectly cast, and a beautifully crafted movie. Each actor makes his or her role believable. <br/><br/>Depp's accent was convincing, as was his character. He was able to convey perfectly what those who knew Barrie said, that he was asexual and enjoyed the company of children because he never truly grew up. I thought the relationship with his wife was very well done. So much was said without words. Barrie couldn't give her what she needed, and visa versa. They cared about each other but could not connect or sustain their relationship. All the children were superb, especially Freddie. I loved the scenes between Hoffman and Depp also, so droll. I'd like to see them work together again.<br/><br/>I'll be seeing it again as I was so involved in the dialogue and expressions that I really didn't have time to absorb all the detail that went into this movie. It's definitely worth a visit to Finding Neverland. HOWEVER, if you have the attention span of a gnat, hate period drama or want lots of action you'll likely miss the entire point of this movie. It's also not for young children."

All the actors in the film did their parts justice.<br/><br/>The film really had me believing that I was seeing into the life of the creator of Peter Pan and the film managed to hold my attention despite having very little happen throughout.

","Finding Neverland is well crafted and emotionally involving throughout, succeeding across several dimensions. It realistically depicts a failed marriage, as well as a crucial stage in childhood development; it also explores the mechanisms of psychological escape. The movie has a lot going for it including entertaining production numbers -- everything but a proper ending. After ninety minutes of trusting the viewer, Neverland resorts to some heavy handed manipulation, tugging on heartstrings already pulled taught by a story that has unfolded seamlessly up to that point. This has the unwanted effect of making the viewer feel silly and a bit used for having experienced the expected emotions all along. While a little off-putting, it's a forgivable error. Generally a smart and entertaining movie."
"nahteboy","9","1","2","24 December 2004"," A look into the mind of ""Peter Pan"" creator J.M. Barrie
","FINDING NEVERLAND Starring: Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet & Freddie Highmore Director: Marc Forster<br/><br/>I have been a fan of ""Peter Pan"" ever since I was able to read. I've read the original story as well as the Disney version. I've seen almost every film/TV production made, including the fantastic HOOK; the decent, but not great PETER PAN that came out in 2003; the entertaining cartoon THE NEW ADVENTURES OF PETER PAN which included a killer orchestral theme song written by Mark Mothersbaugh of DEVO. So I couldn't pass up a chance to see the enigmatic Johnny Depp playing the role of author/creator J.M. Barrie in FINDING NEVERLAND.<br/><br/>For those who are unaware, Barrie was a struggling author & playwright in Britain during the turn of the 20th century. He was acquaintances with author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (""Sherlock Holmes"" & ""The Lost World"") and had written a number of plays that had been performed, but only enjoyed a moderation of success for the most part. In this biographical dramatization of Barrie's life, we see the subject waiting backstage during the opening night of one of his plays. The play bombs and is promptly ended by his backer, Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman). <br/><br/>Despite this setback and the stressful and faltering relationship with his wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell), Barrie goes to Kensington Park with his lovable English Sheepdog to play and write. There, he befriends the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Winslet) and her family of four boys. 3 of the brothers find Barrie amusing when he tells fantastic stories and wondrous tales, but Peter (Highmore) takes life too seriously and refuses to believe or participate as he is still dealing with the death of his father.<br/><br/>His close bond with the family forms a larger rift between he and his wife, as well as causes problems from Sylvia's mother, Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie - DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, DRAGONHEART, HARRY POTTER & THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN) who wants to put a stop to a man ruining any chance of her daughter, who becomes increasingly ill, finding another husband while she's socializing with a well-known married man; and to put a stop to a grown man playing games with young boys who should be helping around the house, learning proper etiquette, etc.<br/><br/>Overall, the story is told extremely well, including the daydreaming and fantasy parts of the world that Barrie imagines and lives in. The fantasy scenes look comical and even corny compared to what is happening in the real world, but that's the point of it being a fantasy. Director Marc Forster, who made the extremely boring MONSTER'S BALL (I know it won awards, but it was still a snoozer!), has made a very nice film and can thank his cinematographer in part for doing such an excellent job. <br/><br/>The world that has been created of that bygone era and age is done very well, from the costumes and settings to the authentic looking stuffed animals from the Winnie The Pooh series that was new and popular at that time.<br/><br/>Everyone does fine in their acting roles, but the interaction between Depp and Highmore is exceptionally well done. This is something to keep in mind when Highmore plays in Depp's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, which is Tim Burton's version of WILLY WONKA. Maybe it has something to do with Highmore sharing the same birthday as the talented Depp - or maybe Highmore is going to be one of those child actors that really has talent and not just a cuteness factor.<br/><br/>One word of caution to parents taking their kids to this film thinking that it's going to be another version of PETER PAN; it's not! True, there are scenes from the play with Peter, Wendy and the gang, but these are small moments. Most of the subject matter is going to be boring or way above the heads of children. Not to mention, there are a couple of scenes that had a lot of the audience crying, quickly followed by some humor so as not to bring the whole film down. <br/><br/>FINDING NEVERLAND is great story, whether you're a fan of ""Peter Pan"" or if you simply like something that is well-written.<br/><br/>Ethan Nahté"

","If I had to describe this movie in one word it would most definitely be ""beautiful."" The plot line, dialog, and most importantly the visuals were stunning and there is no doubt in my mind that this is a film for everyone. Johnny Depp gives a stunning performance as the creator of Peter Pan, J.M. Barrie and this could quite possibly be his shoe-in for a Best Actor Oscar. Although Kate Winslet did a phenomenal job as well I think the second most honors should go to Freddie Highmore who plays one of the boys that inspires J.M. Barrie to write Peter Pan. Throughout the entire film we watch as his character develops and grows and it is painful and wonderful all at the same time. This movie will make you laugh, cry and smile. It is undoubtedly a must-see for the young at heart."

","I am going to run out of adjectives describing this movie. It is glorious. The screenplay, the acting, the cinematography are all superb, but most of all Johnny Depp. Is this the same actor that played Captain Jack Sparrow last year? What a range he has, as an actor! He is understated in his portrayal of James Barrie the play writer. Kate Winslet is beautiful, and the children are just wonderful. The toughest acting job belongs to Julie Christie and she does wonders with it.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD.....<br/><br/>Barrie, who has been unsuccessful as a writer and in his personal life, finds his muse in Sylvia (Winslet)- a young widow- and her 4 children. Their growing friendship is frowned upon by the society and Sylvia's mother. However, that is what Barrie really needs to write a great play. As the story develops we feel a part of the lives on the screen. When Sylvia becomes seriously ill, we sort of know what is going to happen in the end, but we cling to a hope that may be she will recover. James and Sylvia love each other but it is shown in such a beautiful and subtle way that it is a wonderful change from the crudeness we see on the screen these days. Sylvia wants to see 'Neverland' which is a creation of Barrie's imagination. When she is unable to go see his play on the opening night, Barrie brings the play into her house. By this time tears were flowing down both my cheeks and would not stop till the end. Everything is done so beautifully that I cannot describe it. I am definitely going to see this movie again.I hope it gets Oscar nominations for best picture, director, actor, actress, supporting actor & actress, cinematography, musical score, editing, and screenplay. I give it a 10!"

","Peter Pan has always been a classic tale to me; as a matter of fact,a classic Disney tale is more of what i think of it. But what I didn't realize was that there had been another classic tale behind the Peter Pan tale; the tale of the man who imagined it all, Sir J.M. Barrie. Watching the imagination of J.M. Barrie on 1950's technicolor had warmed my heart with joy and eternal happiness. But to understand everything magical their is to know about the tale, you must experience the imagination of J.M. Barrie's mind. Johnny Depp, being one of my favorite actors, portrays one of his greatest roles of his career. Johnny Depp almost becomes J.M. Barrie himself in the film for all I know. What I can tell you is that J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) was a playwright who meets a beautiful widow (Kate Winslet) and her four boys. This family inspires J.M. Barrie to write his most well known play of his life, Peter Pan. Depp's performance has never let me down through the film. Another performance that I shall always remember would be the performance of child actor Freddie Highmore, who portrays one of the four boys and who happens to be the closest to J.M. Barrie while trying to learn how to see imagination through the eyes of J.M. Barrie. The London setting was shown beautifully, the costumes were made beautifully and what was the most beautiful of all from this movie was to see the reaction of both audiences on different sides of the screen; the audience of the film and the audience watching the film, including myself. A true classic and more than worthy enough of an Academy Award nomination or winner. I give this film a 10/10 because of the moral it tells me; there is a unique Neverland within all of our imaginations and they must be shared with the world. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the great playwright taught me that and as long as I shall live, I cannot ever forget that."

"Chris_Docker","10","1","2","5 November 2004"," Touching the soul of inspiration
","How do you capture that suspension of disbelief that not only makes a great movie or a great play, but is at the heart of every playful notion that has captivated a child at play, every romantic phrase that has enchanted a woman towards her dreams, every word of love that a woman has blanked everything from the mind of the man she adores, every uplifting speech of every great leader that has given hope and fortitude to the populace . . . where is the seat of that creative vision, that sees beyond the world as it is, reaches out towards the world as it could be, and communicates the joy of that vision?<br/><br/>Finding Neverland traces key events of a great writer, JM Barrie, whose childless and less than perfectly happy life not only found joy and fulfilment in creating such a dream, but whose story, Peter Pan, while on the surface a children's story, also examined the very ways that we exercise creativity or 'make-believe'.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp produces another of his perfectly-believable-and-utterly-memorable characters in the form of the troubled author and playwright. Kate Winslet, as the Sylvia whose children provide the inspiration for Peter Pan, does not yet seem to have the acting range to provide exquisitely formed new personas with every film, but her charisma nevertheless screams out from every scene (and, in accordance with every non-skeletal woman's fantasy, she looks totally ravishing). Julie Christie (who plays her mother) and Dustin Hoffman (who plays the producer of Barrie's play) are barely recognisable, giving great dignity to their supporting roles by not hogging the limelight. Kelly Macdonald, the token Scots person, provides a wonderful stage Peter Pan, covering her Scots accent almost as well as Depp contrives his (JM Barrie was from Kirriemuir in Forfar, Scotland). <br/><br/>Perhaps the most ironic thing about Finding Neverland is that it is a film not for children (or even teenagers) but for adults. The deep (and largely unspoken) emotion between Depp and Winslet, the process of reaching out and communicating through poetic language, the way children *do* grow up (and the way adults remain children), and where fantasy and reality begin and end - these are themes more easily recognised by those who have (or maybe always wanted to have) brought up children, rather than those children themselves. Unrequited love, the things that move an audience (and when, why and how it will move them to bring critical acclaim and their cheque books), the importance of artistic and personal legacies -all these topics are treated in a responsible way that Barrie, if he indeed fully understood the importance of what he wrote, would have been proud.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland cradles a lasting inspiration - perhaps one that will last into eternity."

I found myself just accepting that Depp WAS Barrie instead of questioning his portrayal or accent. Kate Winslet was good, but not great. The child actors were convincing and carried the roles well.

","I usually wait until films of this type (non-epic, non-adventure) come out on video/DVD. I was fortunate to see an advance screening and am very, very glad I saw it on the big screen. It's well worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland is a completely enjoyable and uplifting fictionalization of J.M. Barrie's creative process for his most famous work, Peter Pan. It combines a sensitive exploration of the benefits of fantasy to children and adults, and also examines the need to respect children's intelligence in the face of difficult matters such as illness and death. The production, from costumes to locations to casting and the truly imaginative fantasy sequences, is impeccable. Leading the extraordinary cast are Johnny Depp completely convincing as the writer Barrie.<br/><br/>Mr. Depp continues to amaze with an understated, intelligent and emotionally searing performance, which is echoed by the young Freddie Highmore, who gives as good as he gets from his better-known co-stars. Far from being a chick flick or sedate historical drama, this film has a lot to say about the way boys grow into men, and how childhood indelibly affects us all.<br/><br/>The two young girls (aged 6 and 9) who sat in front of me thoroughly enjoyed it; here's a family film for the holidays that is about believing in something more than Santa, elves and the North Pole.

"FilmSnobby","3","3","12","26 February 2005"," The movie that never grew up.
","*Finding Neverland*, though competently done, is a pretty much dishonest movie through and through, in terms of the historical situation of its story (for instance, Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies was NOT a widow in 1903-04 when *Peter Pan* was produced, but was married to a fellow who naturally found Barrie's intrusion into the life of his family deeply offensive and disturbing) and, even worse, in terms of Barrie's creative processes. This movie (based on a recent London stage play called *The Man Who Was Peter Pan* by someone-or-other) would have us believe that J.M. Barrie -- an otherwise ""normal"", relatively successful playwright -- finally was able to encapsulate, in his writing, the virtues of childhood after bumping into Sylvia and her family at Kensington Park. And thus, Barrie rediscovers those childhood virtues for an increasingly cynical modern world.<br/><br/>This makes for an uncontroversial, user-friendly, Oscar-nominated sort of movie, but it's really little better than rubbish. It's one thing to take liberties with real characters and events in order to forge a coherent narrative, but *Finding Neverland* reinvents Barrie and his milieu out of whole cloth. What's the point of that? It certainly renders much of the film's action incomprehensible: Barrie's producer (Dustin Hoffman), for instance, is depicted here as deeply doubtful about the prospects for *Peter Pan*, and yet he agrees to stage it anyway. In the movie's universe, why would he? -- it doesn't make any sense. It becomes more clear when we recall the childhood-fetishism that was rampant in Edwardian England at the time (Robert Louis Stevenson's tales for young readers, and the work of Beatrix Potter, spring immediately to mind). Of COURSE a producer would be attracted to something like *Peter Pan* in 1904. But this movie presents Barrie as an iconoclast who wins converts.<br/><br/>As for Barrie's personal life, the movie makes it equally senseless. There's no clear reason why the writer (personified by the very handsome Johnny Depp) wouldn't make any obviously natural overtures to widow Sylvia (a gorgeous Kate Winslet). Of course, he'd be cheating on his own wife, but the movie isn't quite prepared to make Barrie a saint or a monk. (He IS married in the movie, after all.) In real life, Barrie was something of an actress-chaser who, ironically, may have been sexually impotent -- if one may believe his fiction, and one should, for that is where writers really tell their autobiographies. *Finding Neverland* elides all of this, with the result that his relationship with Sylvia doesn't pass the credibility test. Compounding the problem is that the movie doesn't dare confront just how hung-up Barrie was over the death of his brother David, or the resulting Oedipus complex that followed with regard to his mother. We get a quick speech tossed off by Depp -- ""My brother died; my mother never got over it; I dressed in his clothes one night to make her happy"" (paraphrasing, of course) -- that does not begin to explain Barrie's obsession with the Llewelyn-Davies kids and with kid-hood in general. I normally agree with the notion that ""psychologizing"" famous people, artists especially, is a cheap trick that simplifies more than it explains; but here's a case in which the author's own writings give us troubling clues with which the movie avoids dealing. *Finding Neverland* doesn't even consider that the idea of a Boy Who Never Grows Up could be a disturbing one. Sadness and loss are treated here as the dismal adjuncts of growing up . . . when they SHOULD have been the dismal adjuncts of a man's refusal to grow up. I just don't understand why praise has been heaped onto this movie. Perhaps in 2005, Americans feel so dispirited that an infantilizing entertainment such as this seems irresistible. We should resist it, though: among other things, adulthood can be defined as the state in which a person is capable of dealing with life's problems. We cannot afford to be babied in these times, even within the context of pop culture.<br/><br/>3 stars out of 10."

","FINDING NEVERLAND was a big disappointment to me. I was expecting an enlightening, magical look at the creative process and what inspired James Barrie to write ""Peter Pan"" around the turn of the century. I felt as a viewer I got very little. We never learn the first thing about the man or his playwriting abilities. Johnny Depp plays this character on one note through the whole film: there is no emotion, no passion, very little to reveal the inner character. He is portrayed as a hack playwright who somehow rediscovers his muse by hanging out with four young boys and their recently widowed mother, day after day, week after week. He neglects his wife at home. He never explains anything about why he is doing this. The basis of the plot is his deteriorating marriage, and the hostility of the widow's mother (Julie Christie) toward his attentions to the family. This film is extremely slow-moving and drab, the plot mundane, and virtually nothing ever happens that is intriguing, unexpected or remotely magical. Maybe as a Baby Boomer I was conditioned to expect a Disneyfied concept of Peter Pan. I somehow expected more. I have enjoyed Johnny Depp in other films but this is to be avoided unless you are searching for a sedative. About the only positive thing I can say is the boy who plays one of the kids, Peter, (Freddie Highmore) was quite appealing."

","Over all this movie (Finding Neverland) is able to plod along slowly and carefully tell the main story of the Life of JM Barrie with all the ins and outs of how he developed the idea for the Peter Pan story.<br/><br/>I found this movie (and the music) slow and too saccharine and thought it lacked some sort of vigor that I have come to expect from Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet's movies.<br/><br/>Altho I really loved Kate Winslet's acting in this movie but I felt she was held back by the director and the script. Depp's acting was rather stilted and reserved for the whole film also. But I guess that was the director's choice- to give a stilted portrayal of the way snobby middle-class people were in Scotland (and all over) in those days. Now Scotish football fans are loud & vocal about their sport. So at least some things have changed.<br/><br/>Overall, the children were wonderful but I found the boy Peter (Freddie Highmore) was dull and uninspiring and I found close-ups of his eyes that looked like pudgy blobs disquietingly flaccid. The other boys were lively but not seen enough of.<br/><br/>In real-life, (as in the movie too) the Kate Winslet character (Sylvia) gets sick and Barrie (1860-1937) puts his hand up for the Guardianship of the Davies children. Later in life, Michael drowned at 21. The boy Peter grew up but he committed suicide in 1960. Barrie wrote the wonderful plays 'Quality Street' and 'The Admirable Crichton', which were great successes.<br/><br/>This movie was much better than the JM Barrie story with Robin Williams (Hook 1991) which was over done and too long. The way this film showed the 'fantasy' scenes of Tinkerbell and the Pirate Gang were done SO well that I hope they decide to make a full length movie in this style and really bring Barrie's dreams to life."

","Finding Neverland is not a great movie. It's not a bad movie either. Good performances, art direction, and screenplay is still not enough to sum up to ""a great movie."" The movie focuses on the life of J.M. Barrie, during the time of writing the famous play, Peter Pan. What inspired him to write such a wonderful story is a mother and her four children. J.M. Barrie tells the children to believe in magic, and that magic does exist. He and the children play many fantasy games together as the mother joyfully watches. J.M. Barrie starts to develop a strong relationship with this family; the story added with a lonely wife, a disapproving mother, and the play manager. A little bit on the cheesy side, I'm sure there will be plenty of audiences who will enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman, Freddie Highmore and Radha Mitchell all star in this movie, all giving fine performances.

","Preconceived for triumph and tragedy, ""Finding Neverland"" has a great idea but doesn't quite stay on track. The story of playwright James M. Barrie--and the building up to the opening-night stage performance of his ""Peter Pan""--has exciting flourishes, but flourishes are what the film seems to be built upon, and the leftover dramatics are shallow. The opening scene (chronicling a Barrie-written flop) is painfully underwritten; we don't even get the name of the play being performed (and the audience is shown actually falling asleep in the theater!). Dustin Hoffman, as a producer, barely has a character to portray and we never know where he stands--is he a business partner? faithful friend? tireless worker? Johnny Depp stays in a low-key as Barrie and doesn't exhaust his handsomeness, but Kate Winslet's role as the mother of Barrie's muses gets stuck with a deadweight role: ill, she is less a character and more precisely a patient. Fast-forward to the play itself for the real Neverland; that's when the movie accumulates some substantial magic and takes flight. **1/2 from ****"

","I would never have watched this film if it hadn't had Kate Winslet in it. It was a lot better than I thought it would be. Kate Winslet has to be the top tragedienne in the business today. She was perfect, understating her beauty, and playing the Edwardian mother role wonderfully. Johnny Depp is a phenomenal actor, playing the widest variety of roles. He hit the accent as well as Meryl Streep, never missing a single line in it, yet never overdoing it. The whole thing is kind of creepy nowadays though, in these Michael Jackson times. It is really unseemly for a man to pay too much attention to someone else's sons. The idea, I suppose is that Barrie was a child-man, someone who never wanted to grow up. Well, that's how they used to describe Jackson, too, and of course he named his molestation-hideout, uh, I mean, ranch, Neverland. Kinda weird. Anyway Radha Mitchell looked wonderful, and played her part beautifully as well. It ended up being a really entertaining movie, well worth a place in a Netflix queue. But it's not among the top 150 movies of all time. C'mon."
"EUyeshima","6","1","3","14 December 2005"," If You Believe, Clap Your Hands...But Wait Until the Final Twenty Poignant Minutes
","It's no wonder Michael Jackson is drawn to Peter Pan and the concept of Neverland from this 2004 romanticized telling of playwright James M. Barrie's attachment to the Llewelyn Davies family as the inspiration for his classic play. Director Marc Forster, whose only other credit I know is the melodramatic and overrated ""Monster's Ball"", draws fine performances from his cast, but the film itself is oddly uninvolving at least until the last twenty minutes. Forster, along with screenwriter David Magee, takes a rather reverential attitude toward their subject, and this beatific sense is heightened by the immaculate approach toward the production.<br/><br/>The result seems targeted squarely at the Merchant-Ivory connoisseur of good taste, but somewhere along the way, the edges have been dulled, and the intensity of feeling that Barrie has for the boys has been mollified for a broader audience. Fortunately, Johnny Depp has been ideally cast as Barrie mimicking a convincing Scottish accent in a surprisingly restrained performance. Even so, his unsullied playfulness comes through in his scenes with the children even if they tend to go on ad nauseam. Looking almost too radiant with an innate inability to convey fragility, Kate Winslet has the saintly role of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, the sickly mother who lives selflessly for her boys while in self-denial about her undisclosed illness.<br/><br/>Even more thankless is the role of Barrie's social climbing wife Mary played in an overly pinched manner by Radha Mitchell (take a look at the outtakes to see a much livelier actress at work). Because her character is drawn in such shallow strokes, the unspoken love implied between Barrie and Sylvia seems all the more distracting from the main point of the story, the parallel between life and fantasy in Barrie's writing of ""Peter Pan"". Unbelievably nearly forty years since her enigmatic Lara in David Lean's ""Doctor Zhivago"", Julie Christie plays the predictable part of Sylvia's unyielding, Gladys Cooper-type mother with conviction, supposedly the inspiration for Captain Hook. I only wish her character was developed more to match her well-missed talent. In an even smaller role, Dustin Hoffman plays money-conscious impresario Charles Frohman with welcome panache.<br/><br/>All four boys are effortless though the standout is Freddie Highmore, who plays the pivotal role of third son Peter. He plaintively lends the gravity of a serious child recovering from his father's death and unwillingly in the throes of a man consumed with fantasy, especially poignant in the closing scene with Depp. The recreation of the original production of ""Peter Pan"" is done well, even the fanciful scenes toward the end. I also think credit is due to composer Jan A.P. Kaczmarek, who provides an ethereal and evocative musical score.<br/><br/>The DVD has the standard set of extras. Forster, Magee and producer Richard Gladstein - though sadly none of the actors - provide informative commentary on an alternate audio track. There are three deleted scenes and about five minutes worth of outtakes which frankly could have blessedly goosed the pacing of the film. Of course, there is the expected making-of featurette, ""The Magic of Finding Neverland"" but also a quick film on the film's special effects which could have been much longer and a stars-on-the-red-carpet clip that is completely disposable."

","Yes, I blubbed at the end of Finding Neverland. It played the minor chords on my heartstrings effectively enough, but the film suffers from a slight lack of momentum, largely because of the performances of Johnny Depp and Dustin Hoffman.<br/><br/>Hoffman, a dandyish figure with a mid-Atlantic accent, is a puzzling comic-relief character whose screen presence is distracting rather than engaging. I found myself thinking, whenever he appeared, ""It's Dustin Hoffman! What's he doing here? And is he supposed to be American or British?"" To be fair to Hoffman, it is possible that his accent was a perfect rendition of what Americans sounded like in J. M. Barrie's time, but he never seems comfortable in the role.<br/><br/>And Depp is just a bit wooden. Again, perhaps he is meant to be restrained - the film is set in Victorian Britain after all. But Depp's soft Scottish tones and phlegmatic response to any event, no matter how dramatic, makes the film a little flat. If someone had run in and shouted ""Run for your lives, the house is on fire"" you feel that Depp would have looked pensive and cooed ""Ooh, dear. We'll have to put it out, then."" It doesn't help that the central drama - a main character's disease - is telegraphed so far in advance that you can't believe it is a surprise to anyone when it makes its grand entrance. Still, Kate Winslet is excellent as ever in her English rose role and the children are very good indeed.<br/><br/>If you are fond of a weepie, Finding Neverland will not let you down. But compared to other films ranked in the Internet Movie Database's top 250 it is decidedly weak."

","FINDING NEVERLAND is a beautifully produced costume drama. Technically the movie is very impressive, boasting excellent acting, gorgeous cinematography, sets, costumes and a lovely music score that mimics composer Edward Elgar's more wistful compositions. The recreation of Edwardian England rivals the best Masterpiece Theater productions. But there is a huge hole in the center of this movie that prevents Finding Neverland from being anything other than a four hankie tearjerker.<br/><br/>The true-life story of famed novelist and playwright J.M. Barrie's friendship with the Llewelyn Davies family is given short shrift by a screenplay that insists on telling the tale as a genteel fantasy. Although the dark undercurrents of the story are there, David Magee's script (based on Alan Knee's stage play) elects to tell only part of the story and as a result much potential dramatic tension is lost.<br/><br/>There is nothing unusual about movies veering from the hard facts of biography. To make a an effective audience-pleaser it is often essential that real-life events be juxtaposed for effective cinematic storytelling. But in the case of Finding Neverland the actual events surrounding Barrie's life and relationship with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies and her five sons were so inherently dramatic that changing the story even minimally seems innocuous at best.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly the best scenes in Finding Neverland deal with the creation, rehearsals and opening night premiere of Barrie's classic play, PETER PAN. The mawkish sentimentalism that pervades the rest of the movie is missing in these riveting scenes that swiftly chronicle the emergence of an immortal masterpiece.<br/><br/>James Matthew Barrie was a complex and eccentric genius whose decades-long relationship and obsession with the Llewelyn Davies boys was by turns nurturing , exploitive and ultimately tragic. Johnnie Depp, tall and handsome, cuts a dashing figure as Barrie, an incongruity considering that the famed author was a slight individual endowed with average looks. Depp's performance, while perfectly workmanlike, displays none of the dark moods Barrie was known to have. The actor simply seems to be a conjurer of fanciful tales, a charming babysitter to Sylvia and her sons and a jilted husband to his self-absorbed, philandering actress/wife.<br/><br/>The real story is heartrending and unforgettable. The movie is entertaining up to a point but it should prove disappointing to anyone with even a passing familiarity to Barrie's life and the world he created for the Llewelyn Davies boys. Andrew Birkin's biography J.M. Barrie and the Lost Boys gives a thorough and fascinating account of this disturbing and epochal love story."

It just depends if you want to go see a movie and leave feeling thoroughly depressed as to whether you like this film. The girl who I was with cried a river, I had to use a boat to get out of the movie theatre. One thing I will say is that Johnny Depp did an excellent Scottish accent - probably the best that I know of. No doubt this film will win quite a lot of awards, but does anyone understand how academy awards are calculated? Its not always the best film that wins. I tend to not like movies that are quite so emotional. There is already enough sadness in the world, so the only reason to go see a movie is to watch a good comedy, because then at least you can laugh.

","Two performances - by Kate Winslet and young Freddie Highmore - save ""Finding Neverland"" from plummeting into a routine tearjerker.<br/><br/>You have to admire Winslet. Here's a young woman who could have had her pick of any huge Hollywood movie following ""Titanic"" (1997). Instead, she decided to take on gutsy roles, women with real depth and feeling, in smaller films that took chances. ""Hideous Kinky"" (1998), ""Holy Smoke"" (1999) and ""Quills"" (2000).<br/><br/>These movies might not have been financial hits or even complete cinematic successes. But Winslet made them memorable and proved what a genuinely talented and versatile performer she is. Even today, she avoids blockbusters for substantive roles in quirkier films, such as ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""<br/><br/>In ""Finding Neverland,"" Winslet plays Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, a young widow whose four young sons inspire J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) to write ""Peter Pan"" after they befriend him in a park. Barrie, recovering from a critical lambasting of his latest play, finds succor in their friendship, which also is the fillip he needs as the boys and their mother revel in his wild imagination.<br/><br/>Depp fits Barrie well. He's so chameleon-like we forget we're watching Depp. He and a radiant Winslet, who could create sparks with anyone, complement each other perfectly. The boys are delightful, but young Highmore grips us with a raw performance as young Peter. It's no wonder Depp recommended him to director Tim Burton for ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.""<br/><br/>In many ways, ""Finding Neverland"" is old-fashioned storytelling, using cinematic conventions of yore to politely show a character's declining health.<br/><br/>The film looks beautiful. Wonderful cinematography. What bothered me is that director Marc Foster and screenwriter David Magee cop out when they had a fascinating story to tell. It's as if they know what to do to make the audience cry, so that's all they do. True, it works. Because at the screening I attended, several women were sobbing.<br/><br/>Foster and Magee are so wrapped up in their film's magical aspect they don't bother with anything having to do with the reality of these people's lives. The supporting roles are weak. Superb actors - Radha Mitchell as Barrie's wife, Mary; Julie Christie as Sylvia's mom, Mrs. Emma du Maurier; and Dustin Hoffman as Barrie's backer, Charles Frohman - are entirely one-dimensional and given barely anything to do. Especially Mitchell's Mary, whose potential for passionate conflict is grossly underused. Foster and Magee make short shrift of these characters.<br/><br/>Subtlety apparently is not Foster's forte. His over-rated ""Monster's Ball"" (2001) would have been more powerful were it less heavy-handed. In ""Finding Neverland,"" Foster treats his audience as fools. He does everything but superimpose ""This is symbolic"" in some scenes and goes to great lengths to point out the obvious about how Barrie thought of certain ideas. The boys leaping on their beds gives Barrie the idea to make his ""Peter Pan"" characters fly. We get it. There's no need to then actually show the boys flying. We're not that stupid.<br/><br/>As a good-looking three-hankie tearjerker, ""Finding Neverland"" succeeds, I suppose. This film very likely will win awards. But this story deserved better than what Foster did with it."
"livewire-6","Null","1","3","8 December 2004"," First star to the left, and straight on till boring
","I should have realized it was a bad sign ""Finding Neverland"" began with a red velvet curtain and a proscenium arch. Yes, I know, James Barrie was a playwright, and ""Peter Pan"" began as a play. But that doesn't mean that this movie should have adopted theatrical conventions. That results in a film that is, well, over-dramatic.<br/><br/>That's one of the problems with ""Finding Neverland"". It tries too obviously and too hard to tug at our heartstrings. Instead of stirring deep, true emotions in its audience, it succeeds only in engendering a cloying and mawkish sentimentality. And, worse than that, it wrings tears from even its hard-hearted villain -- the grandmother (Julie Christie) of the boys James Barrie (Johnny Depp) befriends.<br/><br/>Another problem is that ""Finding Neverland"" almost completely sidesteps a key point in any examination of James Barrie's life: the nature of his fondness for the Llewellyn-Davies boys. Barrie was rumored, though never proved, to be a pedophile. Only once in ""Finding Neverland"" is this issue raised. As in ""Alexander"", our hero's sexuality is not honestly explored. At best, this version of Barrie might be labeled an oddball or an eccentric -- a rather superficial assessment.<br/><br/>The point is not to pander to prurient interests, or to dismiss Barrie as some sex-crazed monster. Rather, the film could have considered how he sublimated his desire and transmuted it into art -- in much the same way as homosexual Michelangelo was able to create Adam, David, and the muscle-bound Christ of the Sistine Chapel's ""Last Judgment"".<br/><br/>To be sure, in this depiction of Barrie, there are hints of a lost childhood, of growing up too soon. And there is philosophizing about how quickly youth and time pass, till the Grim Reaper claims us all. But ""Finding Neverland"" fails to capitalize on an idea suggested by its final scene: that our physical selves may be mortal, but the products of our imagination can live forever. <br/><br/>Finally, ""Finding Neverland"" is simply too staid, static, and stodgy. Except for the scenes where Barrie engages in imaginative play with the Llewellyn-Davies boys, the film lacks dynamism and energy.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to ""Finding Neverland"".

Yet despite the fact that Neverland oozes quality, it didn't hold my interest until the final third. Up to that point, the movie consists mostly of scenes in which Barrie plays make-believe games with Sylvia's children. These scenes didn't work for me at all. Barrie is supposed to be relating to the children on their level, like Peter Pan. But Depp's Barrie pales in comparison with the character Barrie created. Depp isn't nearly as convincing in the role of child-man as Mary Martin was in the classic TV version of Peter Pan. It doesn't help that the director chose to insert fantasy sequences during the make-believe scenes rather than letting Depp use his acting skills to convey each imaginary situation. The only other potentially interesting thing going on in this first section of the movie is the budding relationship between Barrie and Sylvia, if you can call it that. There is not a touch between them or even a longing glance. They only talk about the kids, not each other. The movie does pick up in the final third when rehearsals start for Peter Pan.

In fact, intentional or not, there was little chemistry between anyone except occasionally Depp the children. I found the children's performances rather stiff and, aside from a few scenes, unconvincing. I was not terribly impressed by the storyline which fails to mine the relationships between Sir James Matthew Barry and Sylvia Lewell Davies or his wife, Mary Barrie. Dustin Hoffman was solid as usual - but again, we get too little of him and it's never clear why his character is prepared to continue to back Barry's plays. Although it's cinematography is lovely, I was very disappointed with this film. The story had immense potential, and who could fail with Depp, Winslet and Hoffman?

Barrie wrote Peter Pan there's nothing new. It might hold interest for those who don't know how it was derived.<br/><br/>The internal demons & driving forces that spill out are undoubtedly responsible for a timeless masterpiece, unless you saw it as a dark tale, which I did even as a child. The more I find out about Barrie the more the darkness seems obvious. Just like the classic ""It's a wonderful life"" scratch away at the surface cheer & seemingly happy message & you will find that it is under-laid with sadness, sorrow & regret. Fear of aging, the loss of innocence & the desire to escape from the world all pervade Peter Pan.<br/><br/>For me these avenues are not adequately explored, although they do at least get a mention, which is something of a first.<br/><br/>The best part of this film was Johhny Depp, closely followed by Kate Winslet, at last shedding her the stigma of her role in the truly God Awful Titanic. Depp is almost always watchable & makes interesting films. He even shows that he's able to master a passable Scots accent, although it was decidedly shaky at times (I used to live there, I should know). Winslett is still playing the solid, dependable type, which she needs to break away from if she's not to become typecast. But again she's watchable & assuredly professional, unlike the plethora of ""Stars"" that crowd the screen these days who basically recite lines & can't actually act (are you listening Mr DiCaprio?).<br/><br/>Julie Christie, a lifetime away from her role in Dr Zhivago, is brittle & edgy as Mrs Barrie, but Dustin Hoffman's role as the indulgent theatre producer, Charles Frohman, seems to at last have found that third rank niche that he truly deserves. For far too long he's traded on his part in The Graduate, seldom rising to that level & never exceeding it. He does act with restraint, something that must have been difficult for him & there's thankfully no breathless grandstanding from him as in truly boring ""Outbreak"".<br/><br/>It is interesting that Hoffman also played ""Hook"" in the film that explored that character a little further in the Peter Pan tale.<br/><br/>Despite all the positive aspects I still can't see the attraction of the film. For me the best part were the out-takes, where Depp, Christie & Winslett, along with various members of the cast, all fool around. The scenes with the dog were surely worth the price of the DVD rental alone, Depp turns the fluffs into pure comedy, mindful of exactly how it will look on the screen even though it will never be shown. This man is a genius & you have to wonder if he will ever find a project that will fully exploit his creative talents. The mistakes with the actors flying gear are also hilarious.<br/><br/>This is a chick flick, so guys be prepared to be bored. If you've been forced into watching this by wives or girlfriends make the excuse to go & get some tissues (they'll need them for the weepy bits) & don't come back before the end of the film, then sit & watch the extras & out takes."

","J.M. Barrie is one those people whose books reflected both realities and fantasies in their normal life. So his life has been much analysed. The creator of superman is getting the same treatment now.<br/><br/>For those who has seen only the Disney version of Peter Pan then you probably don't really understand the true depth of the story and it is worth seeing the newer version of Peter Pan released in 2003.<br/><br/>This is the story of how life, death, children, and other things around J.M. Barrie inspired his work. Like Shakespeare in Love this movie will help you get some insight into the mind of a great man, but it is far from historically accurate.<br/><br/>Other Peter Pan stories (not just the famous play) say Peter fighting against the boring stuffiness of upper middle class British society.<br/><br/>Here, Hollywood of course adds for to much sugar and makes it much more positive than the reality, while adding music to underline the tragedy.<br/><br/>While it is comfortable with the topic of death it fails to address the sexual issues in the play. J.M. Barrie is said to have never really grown up, and may not have been capable of having sex. Peter Pan reflects his sadness as those around him change from children to adults while he stays forever a child.<br/><br/>OK, getting over the fact that I have read a lot on the life of J.M Barrie it is still an entertaining movie about the creation of art. I am not sure whether to say watch Peter Pan first and then this movie or the other way around, either way would provide a portion of enlightenment (one viewing of this movie will provide the total of your recommended daily intake of enlightenment).<br/><br/>I think this movie lacked the courage to take us to harsh reality of neverland. For in Peter Pan, Neverland is wonderful and fantastic, but contains dangers and perils, with fears of death and sex. That was not present in this movie."
"Red-125","6","1","4","28 December 2004"," Minority opinion
","Finding Neverland (2004), directed by Marc Forster, has received high scores and rave reviews on IMDb. This review represents a minority opinion. I found the movie shallow, the acting mediocre, and the ending obvious.<br/><br/>The one strong aspect of the film has been noted by an earlier reviewer--it allows a glimpse into the mind of a creative artist. JM Barrie takes bits and pieces from real life, and turns them into Peter Pan. Interesting, but let's remember that what he created wasn't exactly King Lear.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has great cheekbones, Kate Winslet suffers beautifully, and Julie Christie demonstrates that true beauty is independent of age. Dustin Hoffman, as Barrie's long-suffering producer, was the only actor for whom I would have wished more screen time. The child actors were adequate, but then so was the dog.<br/><br/>I think this movie is too mature for children, too childish for adults, and not right for anyone. Don't say you weren't warned!"
"rauh-georg","5","1","5","4 February 2009"," Incredible BORE - WAY overrated movie
","This movie fails to deliver on many, many levels.<br/><br/>The first 60 minutes were literally a pain to watch, and its not only me sharing this opinion but my wife thought the same thing.<br/><br/>There is no story-line, whatsoever, until the movie is almost over, there is not captivating plot, no drama, no love, no action for over an hour, literally twitching on our seats to prematurely end this incredible bore of a movie.<br/><br/>Only after about 60 minutes the movie gets ""halfway"" interesting, about at the time when he presents his new play. The scene with the orphans in the theater was great, movie from there getting a little better - but in my opinion already too late to make this a ""good"" movie in any sense.<br/><br/>The acting is OK, the filming is OK, but i think the big flaw in this movie is actually the story/writing.<br/><br/>The fact that she (Winslet) got sick in the movie seemed almost forced, very predictable, very obvious.<br/><br/>The minute she started caughing we all knew that she will die, a 100% no-brainer which made this movie element seem forced, maybe just put in the movie to ""save"" this boring movie with a dramatic ending to make it SEEM good....by using the element of the sick/dying mother and using tears of emotion.<br/><br/>However, the fact that the movie has a sad ending and causes a big fest of tears is not enough to make an otherwise avg. movie/story good, on any level. In this movie it just seemed out-of place, used as a filler, to give the movie at least SOME substance or story where it otherwise failed.<br/><br/>Stereotypical use of emotions is used throughout the movie,but not in a captivating way which would make you want to follow the story - but in rather repetitive and very unimpressing ways.<br/><br/>Kids without a father, not accepting the new friend ""as new father""...VERY old concept. Repetitive rejection, rebellion and negative comments by the kids towards the main character in regards to their ""dead father"". No BIG cinema, but a stereotype we can see in many movies , many other movies where we have the same concept and stereotypes, but then used by complex and interesting characters.<br/><br/>Here, in this movie, it just seems flat, without substance.<br/><br/>At the end it is clear that the movie tries to ""save"" itself by focusing onto the illness of the female main character - but also here the movie fails. The illness of her is covered in a very sloppy way, too hasty and quick to develop a good, emotional story based around this element.<br/><br/>It COULD have been a good, emotional movie evolving around the mother, her illness, her kids and this friendship...but for being a good ""tear drencher"" those parts of the movie were just not intense enough, rather ""inserted"" into what otherwise is a very unspectacular and very boring movie.<br/><br/>It could also have been an interesting movie about him, his attempts to make a big breakthrough as writer of a new play. But it was not.<br/><br/>It could have been a good movie about the main character, a story about the eternal wish to stay a kid forever, a story about dreams, fantasy and the power of imagination. The movie certainly attempted this, but it could not convince in this regards.<br/><br/>It COULD have been a love story, a VERY good love story with the main character involved into a complex relationship....but in this movie it just didn't happen either.<br/><br/>As i wrote above, the movie failed to deliver Drama, Love or Action...and the illness of winslet at the end does not change this and all these important elements are missing in the movie."
"funkyfry","5","1","5","29 June 2006"," A bit over-sincere, but well done
","I didn't really think of the film as anything exceptional, neither exceptionally bad nor good. The production was excellent, all the actors including even the children were top notch. I think the story kind of simplified some things that should have been left more up in the air, for example Julie Christie's mom character was too evil and one dimensional in the early parts of the film and then her transformation was handled much too quickly to be convincing that she actually came to like Barre in any way. Even more so with the author's wife, who fluttered about on the periphery of the film never really being given any meaty scenes, and then brought back for closure reasons in the middle of the finale. She barely even qualified as 2 dimensional though I would blame it on the script and not the actress. I thought the scenes with Depp and Winslet were well done, just restrained enough to be realistic to the time period but also to convey their mutual feelings that go beyond respect or just affection.<br/><br/>I got the feeling that if this had been a film about one of my favorite writers, I would have loved it. It was very much a tribute -- I can't even remember ever seeing Depp play such a ""good guy"". Maybe that was part of the problem, I don't know. In the end it was nothing special for me."
"klemen-perc","5","1","5","28 November 2005"," too much of a fairytale to be true
","So this is a film about a famous writer of Peter Pan, James Matthew Barrie, but in my opinion this movie is a fairy tale and does not reveal the truth about the author.I think that Barrie is not shown in a realistic way, in the movie he is shown as the child in a man's body and how he is not understood by the people who surrounds him (Emma Du Maurier,his wife...), how they misjudge him and so on. I think that's fake and that this movie was made for a very average movie viewers and for us who have a little more brain this movie is not 8.2 out of 10. The real life of J.M.Barrie was a bit different, some people say that he was pedophile and that's why he was spending so much time with children unfortunately we don't know what exactly was doing with them or to them but in my opinion he was a little bit ill in the head and the right genre for this movie should be drama not fantasy. Being ill in the head was probably a good thing, almost every famous writer, poet, painter, philosopher... was a little bit ill, and if Barrie wasn't he probably wouldn't have written such great book as Peter Pan, so it's a shame this movie was made for the Oscars and not for the true movie fans."
"gurkpeter","6","1","6","7 April 2006"," Ladies perform superbly, Depp destroys the movie
","Not being a fan of Peter Pan I can say that I did not have any prejudices for this film - except the I expected nice performance from Kate Winslet. In my opinion the Depp just could not handle his role. The interaction between the ladies is a story full of drama and a good reflection of motivations in society. And they seem to understand it and play wonderfully. The boys are acting okay, not very good, not very bad. Why writing about actors not the story? For me the story about Neverland was not interesting at all. However the play of the three ladies is a very strong point of the film justifying to go to see it once in a life."
"gelman@attglobal.net","5","1","6","19 November 2005"," Vastly Overpraised
","The problem with seeing any movie that has been praised to the skies is that elevated expectations are very difficult to meet. And, I need to confess, that may be part of my problem with ""Finding Neverland."" But it is far from being the only problem. An immense amount of talent -- Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Julie Christie, Dustin Hoffman and the beautiful Radha Mitchell -- has been lavished on a story that might have been an interesting biography (to the extent that it's true) but that, in my personal opinion, simply does not make it as a film. Frankly, I find it difficult to invest any real interest in how James Barrie came to write ""Peter Pan"" or in the peculiarity of his relationship with the widowed young mother of four boys while failing to maintain any kind of relationship with his wife. I enjoyed watching the still beautiful Julie Christie in her unsympathetic role as the grandmother of the four boys and wondered why Dustin Hoffman would take a minor role that makes no use whatsoever of his immense talent. Johnny Depp is certainly versatile. I'll give him that. But I haven't been much impressed with his acting in other parts and he didn't impress me in this one. As for Kate Winslet, she dies beautifully. All these actors must have seen something in the script that I didn't see in the movie. Or is it that show business is ever fascinated by show business stories? This isn't quite a turkey but it's not a cause for Thanksgiving either."
"pekinman","5","1","6","1 April 2005"," On second thought...
","I submitted a commentary, since deleted, on 'Finding Neverland' after I first saw it. Now I've seen it again and have altered my initial opinion substantially. The first viewing left me feeling a bit bored, albeit intrigued, and finally moved, as the makers intended me to be. I was charmed, and that's not a bad thing. Upon second viewing I am confirmed in my earlier suspicions that there is much less to this movie than meets the eye, mind or heart.<br/><br/>I was, and still am, impressed by Johnny Depp who turns in yet another fine performance, delivering his lines with a natural Scottish brogue. There are other fine performances, notably Kelly MacDonald's Peter Pan. Kate Winslet is a fine actress and does what she can with the one-dimensional character written for her. And it's good to see Julie Christie still at her most acerbic. I sensed she was holding in laughter the whole time for some reason. She plays a tinsel gorgon and seems to not really believe in the character's motivations. This isn't surprising as none of the characters seem to evolve out of any sort of authentic human spark. They are all cardboard cutouts. The usual portrayal of ""uptight"" Victorians as seen by Hollywood is in full evidence. Even the children are too clean, their little pranks and fights all choreographed and careful. Fortunately the four Davies boys are played by fairly natural actors who are happily free of cuteness or obnoxious precociousness. Young Michael is especially engaging. The focus boy, Peter, is too glum by half but well acted.<br/><br/>The story is interesting but has not been brought very effectively to the screen in this movie. It's a surprisingly ""down"" film with little humor. It has charm of a Disney-esquire nature but it rings false most of the time. The writer has attempted to manipulate emotions from the viewer, leaving one feeling a bit conned in the end.<br/><br/>I can't put my finger on it other than to say something went awry in the conceptualization meetings in pre-production. A wrong turn was taken somewhere and the result is an oddly shallow and predictable charade. A high-tech panto for adults.<br/><br/>It's all a pity because the cast is very good. The technical side, of which the production team seemed especially proud of themselves in the ""special feature"" sections on the DVD, is also good. But that's what this film feels like, a show-off piece for fancy camera/ computer work and cleverly edited scenes. The movie flows like a very shallow rivulet when I really would have liked a more deeply flowing river. Charles Sturridge did it better in 'A Fairy Tale' and without the blatant emotional manipulation.<br/><br/>I didn't dislike 'Finding Neverland' but I think I'll just read the play 'Peter Pan' next time. <br/><br/>But then there is Johnny Depp's Barrie and Kelly MacDonald's Peter Pan that will probably charm me back to the DVD again."
"blatanville","6","1","7","27 March 2005"," pretty underwhelming, especially given the hype
","I cannot imagine what all the shouting is about. ""Finding Neverland"" is poorly shot, badly edited, emotionally limp and dramatically empty. Much like what I remember of the director's previous effort, ""Monster's Ball.""<br/><br/>Let's take these complaints in order:<br/><br/>1. Poorly shot. What the HELL was up with that swirling camera action at the end of the first public performance of ""Peter Pan""? Seems to me the director didn't know how to capture or convey the supreme emotion that the theatre audience (and by extension, the movie's audience) were supposed to be feeling, so he decided to give us all vertigo with an effect even less subtle than something Andrew Lloyd Webber might have dreamt up. Come to think of it, I bet most of the people who were ""blown away"" by this flick think A.L.W. is some sort of genius, and plan to own a copy of ""The Phantom of the Opera (2004)"" when it comes out on DVD... The scenes in the Imaginary Circus, where JM Barrie is dancing with the dog/bear, are straight out of another poorly shot attempt at fantasy: Moulin Rouge. Wild and swirling cameras with monstrously leering extras might frighten the little ones, but it doesn't engage anyone over the age of four.<br/><br/>2. Badly edited. I don't blame the editor so much in this area, as the director probably gave him crap to work with. One particular example that springs to mind: JM Barrie is writing in his journal after teaching the boys to fly a kite. Little boy Peter approaches him to talk. The initial frame is an interesting low-angle and canted shot of the boy's approach up the hill. As soon as he reaches Barrie's feet, there's a cut to a boring medium close-up of the boy speaking to Barrie. There's no reason to switch from the two-shot to the medium close-up, except that perhaps the director couldn't get consistent performances from his cast of youngsters (a difficult task for any director, certainly, but if you're not up to it, don't attempt a movie like this one, n'est-pa?). There are numerous shots during the scenes in the park where Barrie is entertaining the boys with the dog where the frame leaps from one side of Barrie to another, and back. This causes a serious dislocation in space for the viewer who needs to know where the characters are in relation to one-another to make sense of the action. Call me a film-school drop-out geek for complaining about this, but it's a serious problem with the shooting and editing in this film. Later, after Barrie has invited Sylvia and her kids to stay at his wife's cottage (and we never really explore how dense Barrie must be to not see that his wife would have a problem with this, today or especially in Edwardian England), there's a scene where Sylvia and Barrie are talking. Rather than answer her directly, Barrie suggests they go outside to look around... This moment might have been played for some sexual tension between the two, with Barrie defusing it by leading her out-of-doors where they're not alone. Instead, we cut away immediately to Barrie, dressed as a pirate, stalking one of the boys in the woods. Huh? What happened to the scene that should have followed? Oh, it's not about depth, it's about whimsy. That Barrie, what a whimsical character!<br/><br/>3. Emotionally Limp. Yep, limp. This arises out of my fourth complaint, so let's tackle it here,too:<br/><br/>4. Dramatically Empty. Are we at all surprised that Sylvia is going to die? Is there any drama to Sylvia's coughing fit (excepting that it happens at the worst possible moment for Young Peter's artistic expression. How convenient.)? Are we at all surprised when she dies of her mysterious ailment? (Incidentally, according to some research, she died of cancer. Not mentioned in the film, and I can't imagine why not.) Oh! and what of the 25 seats in theatre! Brilliant of Barrie to execute that trick of placing children amongst the adults, if it really happened. But as a dramatic element in the movie, it fails to add up to anything. Are the seats gonna be filled? Will Barrie pull it off? Will the producer (Dustin Hoffman) fail to trust Barrie and try to sell the seats right at show time? If you were surprised by the outcome, you've never seen another movie in your life. The movie also conveniently alters history to avoid further drama: The only potential source of conflict to Barrie's idyllic life with Sylvia and the boys is Sylvia's Mother (Julie Christie). Again, according to some quick google-research, Sylvia's husband was alive when Barrie met Sylvia and the boys, and resented his interference with their domestic life. That, combined with Sylvia's mother, and multiplied by Barrie's wife's concerns about his relationship with Sylvia and the boys would have easily upped the dramatic stakes here. But neither the screenwriter nor the playwright before him chose to gamble with such a sticky area: Barrie might come across as an early-century Michael Jackson (let's not get into his Never Never Land connections), and that wouldn't make for a light-hearted, tear-jerking, fantastical movie, now, would it?<br/><br/>P.S. you might wonder after all that why I would still give the movie 6 stars. I thought the art direction and visual tone of the movie were excellent (watch the DVD's extras to see how the camera original footage was graded to give it more dense and somber tones). I thought the acting, for what they had to work with, was pretty good."
"gcrokus","6","1","7","6 February 2005"," The Only Best Picture Contender That Is A Yawn
","Of the five nominated films for Best Picture this year, ""Finding Neverland"" is in our view the weakest of the lot. And in fact we would argue it should not have been nominated at all. ""Kill Bill 2"" or ""Hotel Rwanda"" would have been better choices. But why might ""Finding Neverland"" not meet our expectations?<br/><br/>For one, this is a fairly boring tale. There is not one adult situation that hints of stress or personal conflict, or at least not in any normal human way. And we are beset with the New Age twist to how we should behave around kids; we hear an awful lot of ""quiet voices"" and as is customary in tales embracing the adoration of all things child-like children are afforded the powers of observation and acumen of adults.<br/><br/>Prior knowledge of the Peter Pan story is requisite. And while that tale has most undoubtedly been treated well in many of our lifetimes, the background of how J. M. Barrie came to render the original story is less than compelling, really. That Barrie subsumed himself in a child-like fantasy world is amusing, but no more than that. ""Finding Neverland"" might be a far more interesting account of the principal's lives if it had been more true to real life and if we had been shown even a smidgen of chemistry between the real-life Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet) and J. M. Barrie (Johnny Depp).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp no doubt gives a seminar in acting, as he always does; he is one of our finest actors. In an interview (http://www.the-trades.com/column.php?columnid=2898) director Marc Forster describes Depp ""as a 'great creative collaborator'. 'The amazing thing is Johnny ultimately trusts the director,' Forster explains, 'and Johnny Depp trusting me is the highest compliment anyone could give me.'"" Nonetheless Depp's carefully nuanced performance is no better than Kevin Kline's own in ""De-Lovely"", and one could say they are even similar, with Kline getting the edge for the risks he takes and the passion he brings to the screen.<br/><br/>Of the films nominated, these are the IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings, respectively: Sideways (96%, 8.1/10), Million Dollar Baby (93%, 8.3/10), The Aviator (89%, 7.7/10), Finding Neverland (84%, 8.2/10) and Ray (82%, 7.9/10). In like manner, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" checked in at 85%, 8.2/10 and ""Hotel Rwanda"" garnered scores of 90% and 8.5/10. We leave it to you to make the final determination, but ""Finding Neverland"" is exactly the type of film that will leave art film detractors delirious with delight; it is a yawn.<br/><br/>Rating: Two and ¾ stars."

","Finding Neverland (2004): Dir: Marc Forster / Cast: Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Julie Christie, Radha Mitchell, Dustin Hoffan: Set in 1903 London and regards James Barrie, a failed playwright about to embark on his biggest success in Peter Pan. It regards imagination and the hope Barrie gives to a widow and her four children. Predictable yet contains inventive visual splendor. Well directed by Marc Forster who won acclaim with Monsters Ball. Unfortunately this film must rely on its visual splendor and a fantastic performance by Johnny Depp as Barrie whose imagination has no limits. He allows people to step outside of reality and experience freedom through one's creative thoughts. Supporting roles are the film's biggest problem. Kate Winslet as the widow makes things far too obvious with her coughing spells what her fate will be. Julie Christie is wasted as Winslet's strict mother. Radha Mitchell as Barrie's wife is forgettable. Dustin Hoffman plays the producer of the play and perhaps more of him would have rewarded the film better, otherwise he is underused. Overrated film that pretty much takes an interesting idea and botches it extremely within formula writing. Theme of imagination and the willingness to dream is positive and quite evident but perhaps if the screenwriter wasn't dreaming so much then maybe this film might be taken more seriously than it is.

Though it may have something to do with peter pan and children, it is an adult-themed film. <br/><br/>A reputable score is salvaged from me because of the terrific performances from Winslet and Depp. The children were well casted yet forgettable in my opinion. Dustin Hoffman was neither well casted nor well utilized. <br/><br/>My real problems come with director Marc Forster. His previous film ""Monster's Ball"" was literal misery too watch. He also directed Quantum of Solace where he again disappointed me after the previous bond movie ""Casino Royale"" was such a hit. But I was willing to give him another chance on this one.<br/><br/>The bottom line is I felt Forster underachieved in a golden opportunity for creativity. The story sounded like it would appeal to both children and adults and Forster was caught in no- man's land. I can tell you that children will not find this entertaining at all. Their is much too drama and the few elements of imagination throughout the film are mostly only recognized my adults. The tone of the film is certainly not light and happy.<br/><br/>I do admire the points that were able to be conveyed without the use of sex, violence and bad language but if your going to take that all out, you should at least make it appeal to kids"

","Happy Thoughts A Short Review on ""Finding Neverland"" At ""Finding Neverland"" we view a film that tries to portray the life of J M Barrie (Johnny Depp), the writer of ""Peter Pan"", 1904.<br/><br/>Neverland is where the time stops and boys remain boys. Neverland is where we all want to live in when we find out how difficult is to be a grown up, a person with responsibilities, and too much in our heads to enjoy simple things.<br/><br/>But ""Peter Pan"" the character who is said to be inspired by ""Peter"", one of the Sylvia Llwelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) son's, is in fact J M Barrie himself. ""I am not Peter Pan. He is,"" Peter says looking at uncle Jim.<br/><br/>This story clearly portrays the internal dreams of a grown up man, who regrets his lost boyhood days and those fantastic times that he had no shadows and he could fly.<br/><br/>But who are fairies? Why did J M Barrie bring fairies into this? Because fairies are children's innocence and happiness. They are symbols of JM Barrie's belief that those little pure smiles will die when we grow up, when we stop believing in laughing and flying. But there is one way to get back to Neverland .To find our happy thoughts. Grown-ups have shadows and no happy thoughts.<br/><br/>As it goes for the J M Barrie's life, we can picture a man in great anguish, struggling with his sorrow of an unhappy marriage and troubles of unsuccessful career. Here Johnny Depp gives a dark shadow to J M Barrie's character. His coldness to women around him, and his obsession with his career, takes him to extremes of abandoning his home and spending his time playing with Sylvia Davies' boys, concentrating on the one he thinks is growing up faster than others, Peter.<br/><br/>Barrie tries to teach the pleasures of writing to Peter, as a tool to escape from the anguish of losing his father and the fear of losing his mother.<br/><br/>Perhaps writing was Barrie's Happy Thought."

This changes when he meets Davies family, which will make him recover inspiration and make him to create the wonderful world of Neverland; writing the very well known book ""Peter Pan"" With a great directing the film shows us the inside world of the writer, being more time in his imagination rather than in reality, which creates a world of fantasy and enjoyment. Actors are spectacular, specially Johnny Depp (his nomination is totally deserved) and Dustin Hoffman (Hook again?). The dressing and the photography is quite good also, as we are in front of one of the best films in 2004. The film claims for the triumph of fantasy, as if you don't like this world, just imagine a new one and live there (this can not always be good); and also the film has a remembering that, despite the fact that you can live in other world, there is, here, the real world and you cannot avoid that if you cannot life here, probably there you will not be happy at all (or not for a long time). The film is good, but the starting is a little slow and I've missed at least some comment's about the darkest aspect of Barrie: the adultery, pedophilia... All in the puritan Victorian age, the same that made Wilde to commit suicide; a larger mention of these aspects I think could have done this film to be better."

","I give this picture a seven but it's success depends entirely on Johnny Depp's performance. The story itself is not intrinsically interesting and the supporting cast does a good workmanlike job but nothing stellar. Direction is fine. The real problem is this is a story that does not really bear telling, let alone deserve a feature motion picture with a talented cast. It is a fine effort wasted on a story unworthy of it.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, I think, has now demonstrated he is one of the best young talents in Hollywood. Certainly he is the best young male actor. He achieved something few actors do well: he mastered a foreign accent and kept it consistently throughout the picture. And he was able to do it with evocative emotion. Only Meryl Streep is another actor who can do this.<br/><br/>Think this is a small accomplishment? Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman failed to do it with a Southern accent in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"". Tom Hanks failed with a Boston Braham accent in ""Volunteers"". Maureen O'Hara failed with an Irish accent in ""The Quiet Man"". And these are all talented actors.<br/><br/>Still, I think the story itself, basically how the author of ""Peter Pan"" gets his inspiration for this tale, is too small and mundane a story for the screen. Others have disagreed and rate this picture highly."
"diand_","5","0","3","27 July 2005"," The power of imagination
","One of the strengths in this movie about the author of Peter Pan is that no characters are so exaggerated put to screen that they couldn't have existed. Emma du Maurier is not an over-evil character; she gives Barrie a difficult time, but has her reasons and in the end even apologizes. Barrie is instructed to be cautious in his relation with the Davies' family at the cricket match in a subtle way. Mary supports her husband to a great extent despite their problems. In Disney's hands there would be no hesitation to remove this balance in story and characters. Note also however that the actual story around the Davies' family and Barrie is completely different and almost the opposite of what is portrayed here.<br/><br/>The writing of Peter Pan, inspired by the Davies' family, offers Barrie a way to deal with his marriage trouble at home and a suffocating British society in general. Parallel we have Peter's coping with his father's death to be the reason he starts writing, inspired by Barrie. When Peter's play is performed, the upcoming illness of his mother throws him back from his imagined world to the real world. The scene in the end with the entering of Neverland is the best in the movie, especially the quick edit after-wards.<br/><br/>The direction is a relatively weak point as Marc Forster (Monster's Ball) could have used some more imagination on a story about the power of imagination. Yes, he weaves in real and imagined images, but that's the only (visual) trick on offer.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is building a whole new career with sugary movies: Chocolat, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and this sugar sweet one. It is an enormous contrast with the wild roles he took on some years earlier.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland is a decent movie, see it if it's the kind of story you generally appreciate."

"MatBrewster","7","0","1","3 May 2005"," Just Read the Review
","All my reviews are at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com<br/><br/>Peter Pan, is of course, the immensely popular story of a boy who wouldn't grow up. The Internet Movie Data Base lists 8 movies with that title, and there are many more films that have been made using the same story. It actually began as an immensely popular play on the London stage. Finding Neverland is the film based on the plays author, JM Barrie and his relationship with the Davies family and how they inspired Barrie to write the play.<br/><br/>We begin the film finding Barrie (Johnny Depp) having just completed the staging of a very expensive, new play, which also turns out to be a bomb. His marriage is falling apart because while Barrie is himself a childlike man, his wife seems to be very much the adult who cannot participate in her husband's whims and dreams. Enter Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet), a widow trying to support four children with very little money. Barrie immediately falls in love with her children. He takes them to the park, plays cowboys and Indians, dances with bears, and indulges every childlike fantasy they can dream up. He is every bit the child they are. They in turn are the muses for his next play. Throughout the film, we see the children acting out bits, we know of from Peter Pan. We see his inspiration on celluloid.<br/><br/>This is a good, well made film. It is aptly directed, and the actors all do fine jobs. My English friend notes that Depp does a decent job with a Scottish accent, and as always, the remainder of his performance is top notch.<br/><br/>My problem with the film lies within the characterization of Barrie, himself. He is made out to be a wonderful, beautiful dreamer. A man who has the heart of a child. He is someone who lives in his imagination. We see the world through his eyes. While dancing in the park with his dog, we see it transform into a circus and the dog into a bear. Anyone who dares to question his fancies, to expect him to act as an adult, is shown in a unfavorable light. Both Barries' wife, Mary (Rahda Mitchell) and Davies' mother, Emma Du Maurier (Julie Christie) do not care for Barrie's behavior and both are made out to be villains. Yet his behavior is to be frowned upon. A married man gallivanting about town with a widow and her children is neither acceptable nor Right.<br/><br/>The film does its best to show us that the Barries' marriage is not doing well besides the problems with the Davies household. They quibble about other issues and we can tell there has not been much love under that roof for quite some time. It is also quick to point out that the relationship between Barrie and Ms. Davies is anything but sexual. In fact Barrie seems to be quite asexual. There is never a hint of masculinity or sexuality portrayed at all. But these are all excuses for allowing a grown, married man to spend all of his time with a woman who is not his wife, and four children who are not his own.<br/><br/>The film wants us to believe. It wants us to believe that life is worth dreaming about. That the eyes of a child can see mysterious forgotten by the likes of grown ups. That they contain a secret joy we too, could experience if only we believed. It also wants us to see that if we do not behave as children, if our minds are lost in the responsibilities of adults, than we are missing out on life. It is hard to refute such beliefs. Life is hard. To be able to escape into a world of pirates and fairies is a miraculous thing. We should all be able to slip into the world of fantasy and make believe for just awhile and let the stress of being and adult slip away. But, there is the cusp of the matter, we can slip away and dream for a time, but life demands that we return. It is irresponsible and shameful to drop the responsibilities of our life, to live our fantasies. To leave the bonds of marriage for another woman, even if you never technically have an affair, is irredeemable. To accept and love a character for doing that very thing is irresponsible.<br/><br/>All of this is not to say that Finding Neverland is without merit. In fact it is an enjoyable, well made film. It is an interesting portrait of the author of one of the English languages most beloved stories. Barrie, as seen here, was a gifted, flawed man. It is a beautiful thing to see a man filled with such whimsy. But we must be careful not to believe that being whimsical gives us the freedom to give up on being grown up.<br/><br/>More reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com"
"JimD73","6","0","4","30 April 2005"," Finding Neverland Focuses on all the Wrong Points
","Plot: 13/25: Sir JM Barrie (Depp) is a playwright who is having trouble finding inspiration. His latest play was a complete flop, and the stage director Charles Frohman (Hoffman) is breathing down his neck for something new. Meanwhile, his marriage to social-wannabe Mary Ansell Barrie (Mitchell) is falling apart. While out walking his dog in the park, he meets four young boys, Michael (Spill), George (Roud), Jack (Prospero) and Peter (Highmore) and their widowed mother, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Winslet). He befriends the children and their mother, becoming a new friend and a new father rolled up into one. Peter, however, does not accept Barrie, and acts too grown up for his age. These children become the inspiration for his next play, about a child who does not want to grow up.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, because of his newfound friendship with the family, there are rumours going around about him cheating on his wife with Sylvia, and worse rumours about him and the children. The sequences about Barrie's social life taking a pitfall are much more interesting than the children from a story perspective. The movie tries to evoke too many emotions with the children, especially Peter. More scenes about Barrie's social life and marriage crumbling would have prevented this movie from being just attempting to evoke sympathy.<br/><br/>Visual Effects/Directing: 23/25: I'll admit, the really brilliant part of Barrie's scenes with the children is the exceptional. When Barrie is playing with the children, we are treated to see deep inside the imagination of the group, and seeing it cut away from the land of imagination and back to the real world is done masterfully. The effects are brilliant, really bringing you into Barrie's world, though the final Neverland effect is more confusing than artistic. Overall, though, the effects are fairly astonishing. Maybe not technically, but artistically.<br/><br/>Acting: 20/25: Johnny Depp, what can one say about him? He has shot off like wildfire ever since his incredible performance in Pirates of the Caribbean, and now I cannot walk down the street without hearing about him. This is for a good reason. Depp has quickly become one of the best actors working today, and FN is no exception for him. He truly becomes JM Barrie in every way, a man who is still a child at heart.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of buzz about Freddie Highmore (Two Brothers) in this film, but I personally do not believe he lives up to it. Well, he does seem good, but mainly because the other three children are all so annoying (especially Michael) that Highmore stands out as being the only one I can listen to without having my head explode in three separate directions. Winslet (Titanic) is good, but not as good as she has shown in Eternal Sunshine, which she was rightly given her Oscar nomination for over this. Hoffman (Rain Man) is good, but he is in more of a cameo role than anything else.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting is good, but those kids are so incredibly annoying I had to mark it down.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 13/25: Finding Neverland could have been better, but instead of trying to be a look into the crumbling of JM Barrie's social world or about simply how he was inspired, it tries to reach out of the screen and yank at the heartstrings. This is just what some people want, but it seems to try too hard to evoke sadness when it should be inspiring or intriguing. It has a lot of potential, and lives up to some of it, but it could have been better.<br/><br/>Total: 69%: Finding Neverland could have been a lot more. It shows vast potential, but is focused on all the wrong things. Sure, it is good for tugging at heartstrings, but it does so forcefully by making you sympathetic. It could have been better, but is still well-acted and very well directed, so this is not a complete waste."

","Finding Neverland is as petrified as a log that's been lying out in the desert sun for ten-thousand years. Every movement of the film is predictable, every turn of the plot, every shot, every emotion. There is almost nothing in it to hold a viewer's attention - maybe Kate Winslet's radiance for a second, maybe Johnny Depp's vaguely subversive sleepiness, but beyond this, nothing. The movie isn't even offensive enough to get upset about - you would think a film that portrays borderline pedophilia as something charming and even uplifting would at least raise a few hackles, but no. The film is so bereft of life that even its potential as a controversial white-washing is wasted. The only thing the movie has going for it is a certain sincerity, a certain earnest belief in its own platitudes. Otherwise it is completely moribund."
"scarletminded","7","0","2","14 April 2005"," Good for a film based on a play based on a person's life...kind of...
","*Might contain spoilers*<br/><br/>Reading some reviews, I wonder what people expected from this film. First, it is a remake of a play as stated in its credits. ""Inspired by true events"" is also added before the credits are over, which throws a lot of the true history out the window before the film begins. A suspension of belief, which was Barrie's calling card, is needed to watch this movie. This is a movie about a play based on a life...kind of. <br/><br/>Knowing this, I enjoyed the movie for what it was. It does have a lot of bathos, but I do think it is along the lines of Depp's new idea to make films his son would enjoy. I do think kids would enjoy this film.<br/><br/>I don't think any of the performances are wooden, they fit the piece and the time frame. I like Kate Winslet in any movie and did tear up because her character was going to die, but then again, I did that in Quills as well. Some actresses just bring up that emotion in me. Your mileage may vary. I also thought that girl from Trainspotting made a really nice Peter Pan. <br/><br/>I do wish this had been more historically accurate. I would have loved to have seen the husband Davies in the movie. His presence wouldn't have made the movie as creepy as it was. His absence makes the whole film take on an ""alternative reality"" which I suppose is tolerated, since it is about the guy who wrote Peter Pan. The history of the family is more tragic than what is shown, but maybe people watching it will be inspired to seek out some real history or at least watch the 2003 film, Peter Pan. That adaptation is wonderful and probably gives you more background about Barrie than this film does. As his wife says in the film, she would probably know more about him by watching his plays. I think this is true of the audience as well.<br/><br/>Despite the fact some reviews think this is a movie for adults, I think it is mainly for young people and teenagers. It reminds me of old live action Disney films and period pieces like Little Woman. To me, the 2003 movie Peter Pan was almost more for adults than children. Again, see that one first. Especially if you haven't seen Peter Pan before. I think you need the education of that play to like this movie. Plus, on that DVD there are extras about Barrie's true life so you will go into the movie knowing all the facts."

","Miramax is masterful at pulling Oscar nominations out of their asses for their sweet sunny films that probably shouldn't be getting as many accolades as it should. That's not to say the movie isn't any good, but generally, it's all about marketing. ""Finding Neverland"" is a good sweet film that follows writer JM Barrie's creation of ""Peter Pan"".<br/><br/>Depp plays Barrie with a lot of tenderness and goodness. Barrie, just coming off a flop and in the midst of a stale marriage hooks up with a family while at the park with his giant dog. Kate Winslet plays a widowed mom with 4 kids and she needs help. Barrie offers it to her and eventually endears himself to her and her boys becoming an inspiration for his writing of ""Peter Pan"".<br/><br/>The movie is well done. It flows well, it's sweet, and of course it's about the creation of a classic story. Who doesn't love Peter Pan? The movie does it's job at telling a nice story. I didn't find the performances anything special, but they were good enough. Depp is good, but I think he excels at the quirkier roles.<br/><br/>This movie received 7 Oscar nominations. I don't see it. It's a nice sweet film that is enjoyable, but I think the nominations are more the work of the masterful Miramax marketing machine. (***)"
"bburns","9","0","2","2 April 2005"," For the first time since ""Scissorshands"", I do not want to punch Depp
","Johnny Depp has long been one of my least favorite actors. Ever since the teeny-bopper cop show ""21 Jump Street"", he has gotten by more on his looks than his talent. Ever since he quit that show to pursue movie stardom, his high esteem amongst critics and fans has largely rested on his eclectic taste in roles rather than his actual performances. The only time (until this film) that I ever saw him give a truly great performance was in ""Edward Scissorshands"". Most of the rest of the time--even in well-written & well-directed fare such as ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", ""Donnie Brasco"" and ""Blow""--he has given wooden performances complete with a Costner-esque monotone. And on the flip side, every once in a while--in order to cement his reputation as an out-of-the-mainstream oddball--he will give a performance that is completely over the top (e.g. ""Ed Wood"", ""Benny & Joon"", ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas""). Lately, in such fare as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Secret Window"", he has insisted on playing characters his own age (41). This would be all well and good if he looked a day over 23 (I'm eight years younger than he is, but he looks eight years younger than I do. Grumble, grumble, grumble).<br/><br/>But in ""Finding Neverland"", Depp has finally given a performance that balances whimsy & restraint, youthfulness & maturity, strange & normal. Much of this, I believe, is due to the the fact that he plays a character who has to be a responsible adult & a good playmate for children both at the same time.<br/><br/>James Barrie (Depp) is a famous Scottish playwright living in London in 1903. His latest play is a flop & his marriage has deteriorated to the point where he and his wife (Radha Mitchell) refuse to sleep in the same bedroom together. In order that he is able to write his next play--and in order to temporarily escape his aforementioned cares--he goes to the park every day with his giant Newfoundland, Porthos. One day he sees Porthos playing with three young boys, and finds a fourth hiding under the park bench he is sitting on. He quickly gets to know these boys and their mother, Sylvia Llewellyn-Davies (Kate Winslet in her best performance since ""Heavenly Creatures""), and decides he enjoys playing with them as much--if not more--than Porthos does.<br/><br/>But all is not well with the Llewellyn-Davies family. Although the childless Barrie is delighted that he gets to indulge his paternal instincts with these boys, it is balanced by the knowledge that the boys' real father recently died & that is not the last major tragedy they will have to endure in the near future. Although under the British caste system they are upper class, they are virtually penniless, which puts them at the mercy of their uptight control-freak grandmother (Julie Christie, as beautiful as ever at 63). All this puts a strain on the family, particularly 12-year-old Peter (Freddie Highmore), who dismisses Barrie's attempts to bond with the children through playtime as ""all a bit of silliness, really"". Barrie worries that Peter is in too big of a hurry to grow up. Needless to say, even though Barrie is the lead character, Peter is the film's emotional center.<br/><br/>As the film progresses and his relationship with the Llewellyn-Davies family deepens, we see visually stunning representations of the inner workings of Barrie's imagination (which he calls ""Neverland"") as he is inspired to write his greatest play, and the only work of his to outlive him, ""Peter Pan"".<br/><br/>This is not a perfect movie, by any means. Some of the dialog probably looked better on the printed page than it sounds coming out of the mouths of the actors.<br/><br/>But this is Johnny Depp's best performance in 14 years. And it's a wonderful DVD to rent for children, particularly if they have lost a loved one and are struggling to cope. Plus it's always delightful to watch Dustin Hoffman steal every scene he's in. 9 out of 10."

","Finding Neverland -- beautiful. Sentimental.

"The_Void","6","0","1","24 March 2005"," Silly message, but not a bad film
","I've become so dismayed by the quality of the recent crop of ""A-class"" dramas that I now go into them with zero expectations, just to avoid disappointment. Finding Neverland, however, surpassed my expectation of zero and, to my surprise, turned out to be quite a good film. It's not brilliant, nor is it a masterpiece but it's definitely worth a watch and is certainly one of the better films to be released recently. The crux of the story is fundamentally flawed, as it professes that is anything is possible if we 'believe', which is, of course, a blatant falsity as anyone that has been alive longer than five minutes will know. The film appears to realise this somewhat however, and this is shown through it's ending, which lends the film some extra credibility. In spite of unrealistic message, Finding Neverland is still worthwhile as the magic of the plot does shine through and even though we know it's not realistic; we can still believe it. Don't you just love irony?<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is certainly one of, if not the, best actor of today and he shows that in this movie. His performance is charismatic and fun, and you can tell that Depp is an artist that really enjoys his craft. He is matched by a woman that is one of the best actresses working today, a certain Kate Winslet. Aside from being beautiful, Kate has matured as an actress since films like Heavenly Creatures and her blip with Titanic and she shows that with a prime performance in this movie. Even the child actors do well in this film, which is a rarity indeed. Even more so since they're not THAT irritating. The film is notable for the way that it portrays it's central characters' fantasies, which is both inventive and fascinating, and thus lends the film an atmosphere of intrigue. The film isn't quite as magical as it thinks it is, but the magic is increased and the film becomes quite potent because of the way that it portrays it's plot. It stays away from the pitfall of fake sentiment that so many movies fall into and keeps itself alive with the strength of it's characters. Overall; not bad!"

","I really wanted to like Finding Neverland. I just didn't connect to the characters. They were remote and unconnected. Also I felt that not enough background information was given that it did not allow me to get emotionally involved in the storyline. This was a personal story that never got very personal. Mr. Barrie (Johnny Depp) was not demonstrative in his emotions towards the fatherless boys that he befriends, with their mother (Kate Winslet) or his wife. He was very into his fictional tales, but it was not enough to keep the story interesting. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet are great actors, they have had some very memorable and impressive roles, but I didn't think these particular roles were exceptional. Additionally the arc of the movie was so familiar and predictable I knew what was going to happen long before it did. The movie seemed to move slowly. A very family oriented movie with no offensive language or violence. I gave Finding Neverland 6 out of 10 stars."

","Struggling playwright J.M. Barrie (another bravura role for Johnny Depp) gets inspiration from a young widow (Kate Winslet) and her four boys (led by Freddie Highmore) and the result is one of the most beloved children's stories ever conceived (""Peter Pan""). Fantastical cinematic experience with that pinch of comedy that mixes to form a demoralizing dramatic tale late that will leave you feeling numb all over. All-world performers Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie are along for the ride, but seem more like guest stars than legitimate characters. ""Finding Neverland"" is a good looking picture, but ultimately the movie never does reach remarkable status. It just appears too British at times with Depp seeming somewhat out of place. The children do nothing noteworthy and this is a huge minus. They come off more as youthful brats from Carol Reed's ""Oliver!"" who truly never did grow up. One of those pictures that will likely be judged based upon your mood when seeing it. Tone-deaf direction hurts its cause. 4 stars out of 5."

","Seen Finding Neverland yesterday in Rome...OK, it was nice, I think that the money for the ticket was absolutely well spent, but when I first heard about this film I thought ""wow! exciting! lovely story, amazing cast...this will probably become one of my all times favourites!"" and when I got out of the cinema I thought ""Ok. Just another nice film."" and I was a bit disappointed... First of all, Johnny Depp is not the right choice for that role. He looks too young, he doesn't seem much ""edwardian"" and I don't like his intent appearance: it's meant to be dreamy, it seems indolent, instead. I would love to see Ian Holm handle the role in the 1987 miniseries ""the lost boys"". By the way I loved all the other actors... Winslet was amazing, thought her character may be defined much better, Christie and Hoffman were simply great (Dustin's character is the best in the movie and has the funniest lines). The children were good, especially that young Highmore, and also Mitchell is very convincing. Another big problem is that in my opinion this film suffers a severe lack of humor: I wished its sad ending was counterbalanced by more humor, but they were always serious, also when Barrie comes in dressed up as an Indian! Afterall it's a movie about childhood and dreams! I think also that the relationship between Barrie and Sylvia should have been developed more,I think it's a very interesting theme. Barrie is meant to be in love with her but he is always seen playing with the children, and never has a moment alone with Sylvia, only when she's dead he tells to her mother that he was in love with her. Too bad, really, too bad."

"Sweet_Ophelia","8","0","1","17 January 2005"," Even the wonderful have flaws
","JM Barried (Johnny Depp) has a severe case of writer's block after critics attack his latest play. His stunted-writing is not helped much by his ailing marital life with wife Mary (Radha Mitchell). It is not until a chance encounter with four young boys in Kensington Gardens, where Barrie often ventures to concentrate on his writing, that the creative juices flow once more for Mr. Barrie. The four boys; Jack, Michael, George and soon to be infamous, Peter ( Freddie Highmore) belong to widower Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet); who recently lost her husband to cancer of the jaw. Propelled by Barrie's ingenious imagination and boyish antics, he and the children become fast friends; although second youngest Peter, is a little more reluctant than his brothers to completely surrender himself to Barrie's fantasy worlds and kindness.<br/><br/>While Barrie uses his relationship with the boys as the basis for his new script; the social circle his wife seems adamant to be accepted into, frowns upon Barrie's commitment to Sylvia and her children. One of those most opposed to Barrie's friendship is Sylvia's over-bearing mother, Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie). There are those who think it most odd that Barrie spends more time with Sylvia and the boys than he does with his own distant wife. And then there are those who sense a darker reason behind his friendship- particularly with the young children. In reality Barrie uses his special connection with the Davies family as the inspiration for his new play, Peter Pan; but he is also on an endeavor of sorts, to mend the somewhat broken family which has seen so much tragedy, and is bound to see more. <br/><br/>This is a wonderful film. It will delight children and adults alike; both for the tremendous and fantastical sets and Johnny Depp's whimsical performance as the everlasting boy, Barrie. It appears that Depp can do no wrong; he chooses wonderful scripts and always delivers an original, and great performance. This man will never cease to please. <br/><br/>Kate Winslet delivers a clean-cut, somewhat one-dimensional performance which is noticeably more the scripts fault than her own; she gives the film all the talent she can muster, but it still falls (perhaps, trips is a better word) somewhat flat.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman plays Barrie's agent, Charles Frohman; but i think Hoffman's star-power is most unnecessary. The role is miniature and of no real consequence; casting an unknown would have made more sense. Peter, played by Freddie Highmore is a wonderful little talent. A little wooden at times, but you can see (particularly in the final scene) that there is promise is the boy yet; Johnny Depp clearly sees it in Highmore, since it was he who put forward the actors name to star as Charlie in the upcoming Depp & Burton film ""Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory"". <br/><br/>While the film is wonderful; it is not perhaps as fantastical as the critics and fans hype it up to be. The script is sincerely lacking; and if it weren't for Johnny Depp's mesmerizing presence, this fact may have become more glaringly obvious. Barrie is written as the ultimate hero; he can do no wrong. For the film to have more substance, this idea would have had to have been thrown out and the character given more flaws. In other words, Barrie should have been made more human. Granted, this is a film for adults AND children.<br/><br/>Finding Neverland is beautiful. Johnny Depp deserves much praise for making an otherwise insufficient script and simple story utterly fascinating. Whether it be for Finding Neverland or one of his future movies, Depp deserves an Oscar. He is one of, if not THE greatest actor of our generation; and must be recognized as such."

"regjer","8","0","1","15 January 2005"," Finding Neverland is lovely child's play.
","Finding Neverland (2004) Finding Neverland is lovely child's play. It depicts the creation of the play Peter Pan by its author Sir James Matthew Barrie. The film opens with us watching Barrie's most recent play, an awful flop. Soon after he befriends a family of 4 boys recently bereaved by the death of their father, meeting them in the park as he struggles to write a new play. The remainder of the film depicts how the relationship Barrie forms with this family becomes the inspiration for his next play, Peter Pan.<br/><br/>Barrie tries to bring the gaiety of imagination to this family, especially to Peter, the boy most grieved. As Barrie plays with the boys, inventing game after game of imaginative adventure we are privileged with the wonder of Barrie's private Neverland. Neverland (a place where dogs are bears, pirates and Indians roam, and believing in something makes it so) is a private imaginative space Barrie has been creating for years, perhaps since his own boyhood; or perhaps it is the imagination of his boyhood never lost, while the rest of us adults have. And this is Barrie's blessing and curse. Like Peter Pan, he is an adult never having completely left childhood - lost in adult society. But the magic Barrie invents for these children by sharing Neverland nourishes the boys and their mother back from their despair.<br/><br/>The genius of this film, like the genius of Peter Pan, is the audience's uncertainty and wonderment about whether this is a kids' story or one written for adults. And of course Peter's answer would be  there need not be a difference.<br/><br/>It is difficult to write about this gem of a film without it sounding completely saccharine. But the director succeeds by coaxing outstanding performances, and employing his magical visual expressiveness (showing the world Barrie and the children have imagined) with subtly and at the perfect times. Where other storytellers would have produce sentimental slop, every pang of grief, or expression of care or childish wonder rings genuine.<br/><br/>Which is not say there are not many emotionally charged, tearful moments - there are. Scenes, such as Barrie telling the youngest boy he must believe the kite will fly before it will, when he tells the oldest boy he had suddenly grown-up in the instant just past before his eyes (when George wants to know the truth about his mother's illness), and the lines in Peter Pan explaining how the first laugh from the first baby broke into 1000 pieces, each one becoming a fairy, all cause tears to well. Like I said, it sounds like absolute emotional swill. And probably in the hands of a different director and without Johnny Depp's performance it would have been. But for my money the emotional tenor remains genuine throughout. (The exception being the film's dénouement after the boys' mother dies of tuberculosis, in which Depp and Julie Christy make nice to raise the boys together. This is the one moment which felt like a Hollywood tack-on.) Johnny Depp has chosen another perfect role for himself (or is it he performed perfectly another role?). He is quietly one of the smartest actors on screen today. Dustin Hoffman seems to be enjoying himself immensely playing Charles Frohman the American financial backer to Depp's Barrie. And it is very fun to see Julie Christy as Mrs. Emma du Maurier, the authoritarian, proper Victorian grandma.<br/><br/>Should you see it? If you need your heart warmed Finding Neverland will leave you toasty."

","I loved this film It was one of my Favorite films of the year along with Big Fish Its not Big and doesn't try to be clever. I have no Idea how true to history it is and I don't care, if it is then Wow if it isn't then i don't think J.M.Barrie would care to much from what is said about the man. Its a story about having fun and using your imagination even if things around you are trying to suppress this. Its a film that Kids may find a bit slow but Big Kids will enjoy. The film is based around J.M.Barries attempts at writing a new play (guess which one) after his last one flops, his inspiration comes from the Davies Children one of them who is called Peter. Peter is a serious child who has issues with his fathers death and at a small age is struggling to cope. Barrie provides the Davies Kids with a Fun Father Figure. As well as the children there is the Mother who has also taken a shine to Barrie and the film depicts their careful relationship as friends. The film involves Humour and playfulness along with more serious issues such as Relationships, Death and Persecution. By the end of the film you will probably be in tears and then an Hour later your heart will feel warm and cosy. Johnny Depp is ideally cast as J.M.Barrie there aren't many people who could play the part as good and none who could have done better. Kate Winslet who plays Sylvia the Mother has that mischievous look in her eye when its needed and the more serious look likewise. The kids are a bit wooden ( as most kids in films are ) but they are quite cute so you can let them off. Julie Christie plays the Stern Grandma and is definitely quite scary.<br/><br/>Overall :- Story - Excellent it tells the tale well and leaves you asking yourself questions about yourself. Pace - Well its not an action movie but the story keeps it moving well. Acting - Very good you believe in the Characters although the Kids struggled with more emotional scenes. Set - Oooh very Victorian but brighter than other Victorian sets. Overall - 9 Very good film the only thing that will put people off is that its a bit whimsical but if your like me and you like that sort of thing then you will like this."

There are a few profound quotes but really, it's just the same Johnny Depp type of movie. It has everything going for it except for the fact that there is no extra spice.

","""Finding Neverland"" is the bittersweet story of J.M. Barrie, the creator of ""Peter Pan."" In this movie, Barrie is played by Johnny Depp, in a subdued but satisfying performance. He plays Barrie as an eccentric who goes against the conventions of Edwardian society. In the story, Barrie had just seen his latest play flop, and is suffering through a loveless marriage. Then he finds inspiration after meeting Sylvia Llewellyn-Davies, a sickly widow played by Kate Winslet, and her four sons. The story switches between bright fantasy and a bleak reality. The best fantasy sequence sees Barrie and his friends aboard a pirate ship, sailing on a sea of stage waves. The touching climax comes when Sylvia falls ill, and is too sick to attend the premiere of ""Peter Pan,"" so the cast gives her a private performance in her home. Watching the movie, you realize that Barrie himself was the sort who just didn't want to grow up. That is something that can speak to us all."

I guess one thing we can admire is the versatility of Johnny Depp in his various roles, from playing a farcical pirate captain to a reserved playwright with a subtle sense of humor. It's becoming more and more convincing that Depp will go down in the future as one of Hollywood's most treasured performers, but it is not so with Finding Neverland.

"Chris Knipp","Null","0","1","21 December 2004"," You'll be touched in spite of yourself
","Was James M. Barrie a pedophile? This movie will not give you an answer. It's a late Victorian tearjerker, a sort of highly edited biopic in which some of the details have been changed around, who was still married when, how many children there were. Was Barrie still married when he met Mrs. Davies and her four boys? Was that the number of boys she had? Was Mrs. Davies' husband already dead? Did she die right after the opening of Peter Pan? It's been telescoped and pumped up, with the aim of gaining maximum sympathy and jerking more tears; and it works. Tears are jerked. This movie is much more touching than one might think. And excellent performances are turned in by everyone; only Dustin Hoffman as Barrie's producer does a merely modest and workmanlike job. Kate Winslet is admirable as the mother Barrie wins over through her boys and Julie Christie imposing in a thankless role as the disapproving parent.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, who has made so many good choices of roles in movies, has become an immensely secure, accomplished actor. Depp is delightful, as usual, to watch. The old inner quiet is still there, with a growing warmth and benevolence. He has said that having a child has completely changed him, and it's obvious his innate playfulness and delight in enacting Chaplin/Keaton mimes now has a purpose -- entertaining children -- that made Barrie an obvious role for him. As Lewis Carroll's cult of little girls led to his masterpieces about the adventures of Alice, J.M. Barrie's adoration of the Davies boys, and wishing they'd never grow up, led to his masterpiece, the fairy tale of a boy who never does grow old. In both cases, the men were childless, and odd. But while Carroll was a mathematician, Barrie was a successful playwright.<br/><br/>Depp is splendid, both charming and self-effacing. But it's highly unlikely the real Barrie was as suave and easy as Depp is in Finding Neverland. He must have been profoundly uneasy with adults. One doesn't really see this in Depp's version.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the movie is very good at suggesting, without having to spell out, all the things it wants to say. It's first about Barrie's relation to Mrs. Davies and her boys, second about how that led to the play he's famous for. As a portrait of late Victorian culture and thought the movie isn't bad. So much isn't talked about that nonetheless is in the air. The real Peter is the linchpin, and the young actor, Freddie Highmore, and the way his part is written, are both quite fine. It's Peter Llewelyn Davies who asserts reality, won't accept fantasy, yet also he who writes, and finds reality hardest to deal with.<br/><br/>It's a fine moment when someone in the crowd in the foyer after the opening performance of the play hears Barrie address the boy as Peter and says, ""You're Peter Pan!"" and Peter points to Barrie and says, ""no, he is."" The relation between Barrie and Peter is a thread that is strong and clear, but never made dominant.<br/><br/>The movie is about the beauty of childish innocence and about the willing of imagination (finding Neverland) more than it's about refusing to grow up; in fact it's made very clear that both Peter and his elder brother are growing up. Barrie notes it with approval, and they accept it. The puer eternus or eternal child theme, which is itself eternal, has its classic modern treatment in this play, but the presence of that theme in the play doesn't cause it to be pressed too hard on the people in the story. The movie doesn't touch on the fact that these boys didn't grow up to have happy lives. Or that Barrie didn't have one either. It's ""Neverland"" is the brief interval between meeting the boys and the success of the play.<br/><br/>The film is worth watching even if it paints too perfect a picture. Here, filmic exaggeration seems appropriate, even the ""Neverland"" that opens up in the Davies livingroom after a performance of Peter Pan there for the ill Mrs. Davies, and her walking off into it, and even the trailer moment when the boys are jumping up and down on their beds and they fly out the window, imagined by Barrie, visualized by the filmmakers. The only real flaw is the too schmaltzy music.<br/><br/>It's not clear whether the filmmakers grasped why Peter Pan became such a great hit in its time, but they do make the magic of the opening performance deeply touching and climactic, as it needs to be. And so are the later scenes when the boys' mother dies and the must deal with this fact manfully.<br/><br/>One can't help but conclude that the screenplay of Finding Neverland deserves an Oscar nomination. Does Depp? Why not? He's a great movie actor, and of all his screen roles, this one has perhaps the broadest appeal. He may be more interesting in Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Dead Man, Donnie Brasco, or Fear and Loathing: those are his defining moments. But he belongs to everyone now, and so he can take away the little statue for being James M. Barrie."

","Finding Neverland was my favourite movie from this year it was really, really great. And I'm not just saying that because I'm a depp and winslet fan but it really is something worth seeing. before it leaves theaters i definitely want to see it again and I'm planning on buying it on DVD as soon as its out. all the actors were amazing and the whole story was great, but this true story will certainly bring out some of the saddest emotions inside of you....so don't forget to bring extra Kleenex you'll need it, it's very heart touching, over all it was absolutely great, i loved it and you should go see it before its to late........"

","Sitting in the theatre, watching ""Finding Neverland"" I was once reminded of a distant past where movies with a lot of soul was in abundance in the maintstream. That past was almost never experienced by me, except for the few movies that I'll always cherish like E.T., Goonies, Titanic, Cider House Rules. From top to bottom, the acting all the way down to the story line I believe that this movie certainly fits the list. Johnny Depp is playwright J.M. Barrie, whose friendship with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her young sons inspired him to write the classic children's story ""Peter Pan"". <br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet lead what seems to me, an interesting ensemble cast both young and old. Johnny Depp, plays J.M. Barrie, carried his role with lots of conviction and respect - a feat that is lost on most young actors today. I also sensed a little instinct that one should watch for young actor Freddie Highmore who impressed me as the one who inspired Barrie to create ""Peter Pan.""The same goes for Kate Winslet - whom has only gone from strength to strength from her ""claim to fame"" role in Titanic a movie whose story which had a lot of heart, just like ""Neverland"".<br/><br/>The story or screenplay, is based on the play ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan"" which was itself a loose adaptation of the life of J.M. Barrie. So that being said, there are things in this movie that I'm sure accurate historians will grumble about like was there any flirtations beween Barrie and Sylvia Lewellen-Davies, but in this case I will defend the screenwriter's choice to concentrate on the children's relationship to Barrie. That in itself provided to be sweet and emotional but not saccharine. After all, the idea of the movie is to make people weep but for them not to hate the movie in the morning. And since I consider this an early awards-favorite, you'd better believe that's the idea.<br/><br/>All that aside, I can truly say that Miramax has come up with something as magical to match Mr. Barrie's magical imagination. That's 2 ""magicals"" in one sentence! What can I say? It's been a while since I've been on journeys like this in the movie theatre.."

","I saw the movie at the Chicago International Film Festival. It was so wonderful, I am still glowing from the experience. The movie was absolutely beautiful -- moving, touching, magical. Johnny Depp, as I expected, was outstanding, as were Kate Winslet, Julie Christie, and the little boy who played Peter. Seeing the movie made me want to learn all about James Barrie -- it was great. <br/><br/>I really can't say enough about Johnny Depp's performance. I was entranced by his beauty and awed by his talent. He is a joy to see.<br/><br/>Like many movies based on real people, this one is not meant to serve as a documentary. If you want to learn about Barrie, read a book. If you want to be enthralled, see this movie."

","I saw this delightful film yesterday at the Chicago International Film Festival, and I must warn you, there was not a dry eye in the house. This movie was<br/><br/>amazingly well done. It was fun to see how, even if it isn't necessarily true, J.M. Barrie picked up inspirations here and there for the characters and story of Peter Pan. What stood out in this film the most to me was the acting. Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore in particular delivered outstanding performances, and I<br/><br/>look foreward to seeing them together again in Charlie and the Chocolate<br/><br/>Factory. This is a great movie for all ages because there was no objectionable language(that i can recall), no inappropriate scenes, and no realistic violence. Children under the age of seven or eight might not enjoy it as much, though,<br/><br/>seeing how they might not understand it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"

","To a dyed-in-the-wool cynic like me, the words 'uplifting', 'inspirational' and 'heartwarming' are marketing kryptonite. But if and when Disney start ladling the treacle on the Finding Neverland campaign, believe me, it really is all of those things. <br/><br/>Marc Forster's direction is imaginative yet focused, sidestepping the many opportunities to lapse into schmaltz with frequent injections of humour and by keeping the, um, theatricals to a minimum. For the latter, he has a universally terrific cast to thank.<br/><br/>Depp doesn't put a foot wrong as the dreamer whose relationship with children is based on mutual respect; Kate Winslet is fine in a fairly stereotypical role, the boys playing her sons are engagingly impressive, and Julie Christie should be at the head of the Best Supporting Actress queue as their icy but well-meaning granny.<br/><br/>JM Barrie's estate might not be particularly thrilled at some of the artistic licence the makers have taken, but as far as I'm concerned, there hasn't been a more elegantly staged or appealing film all year."

","I saw this movie in a small screening room, great screen along with members of SAG and other acting-related organizations, so it was interesting to see their reaction to the movie. The verdict? I loved it and the audience loved it as well. There was enthusiastic applause after it was over. It is, as other reviews have said, a tear-jerker. But on the whole it is a movie that has you leaving the theater smiling and glowing even as you're blowing your nose and wadding up all the used Kleenex.<br/><br/> From start to finish (the ending song by Elton John doesn't suck as badly as I was led to believe) it is a lovely movie; lovely to look at, a lovely story, and the music (apart from the aforementioned Elton John song) was appropriate and, well, lovely. Unlike some of Johnny Depp's other movies, I don't think you'll be hearing anyone say ""the movie would have sucked without him,"" because everything else was on par with his performance.<br/><br/>Speaking of Johnny, my friend was complaining before the movie that he wasn't a good choice to play Barrie. He's taller, better looking, and ironically enough, looks far too young to be playing the 40 year old Barrie. But afterward he had to agree that he was perfect for the part, which requires an actor who is very much very much in touch with his Inner Child. The way he conceived the character, differently from what the writer had originally intended, was as a man who was out of his element in the adult world, and tolerated his life only because he had a rich fantasy life to fall back on. That part of his character is established before he even meets the children. He is a true naif; his only crime is not knowing how to be a grownup. Whether his innocence is historically accurate or not is beside the point. Anyone who can still remember their childhood can identify with his character to a certain extent. He's bored and distracted at grown-up events like dinner parties and play openings. He'd much rather be playing pirates in the backyard. Wouldn't we all? He pays the price for his avoidance of adulthood with an unhappy marriage and rumors and gossip among his more respectable neighbors. He seems to be apologizing throughout the movie for inadvertently causing problems for other people. And his whole performance is tinged with a wistful sadness, knowing that fantasy, no matter how beautiful, can't change reality.<br/><br/>The other performance I have to comment on is Kate Winslett's. Being a mother, I can't talk about her performance without bursting into tears, not so much because of the obvious tragedy of her situation (dying of TB and leaving her children alone) but because Sylvia is much more than just the mother and caretaker of her children. She is their playmate and their friend. You sense, without it ever being said, that the children are her entire life, and that she is perfectly happy to have it that way. All of which makes the loss that much more heartbreaking.<br/><br/>All the other performances were outstanding. The children acted so naturally, it was like watching my own son times 4, but with a cute British accent. Unlike other reviewers, I can't single out Freddie Highmore though. I felt like all the children were equally good, and I'm not sure what the other critics saw in him that I didn't. Dustin Hoffman's role is not large, but his part is memorable. He gets most of the funny lines, and as his producer, is equally charmed and frustrated by Barrie. But he is also responsible for the only glitch I saw in the movie. In the opening scenes, he is shown greeting the playgoers as they arrive for Barrie's new play with a British accent. But in subsequent scenes, the accent has mysteriously disappeared. If it was impossible for him to do a British accent, they should have gone back and either reshot that scene or done a voice-over. But that was the only problem in an otherwise close-to-perfect movie.<br/><br/>The transition from reality to fantasy might have been distracting and looked silly. But it was handled quite smoothly and naturally. Barrie and the children drift in and out of his fantasy world the way a person's mind might wander back and forth between a boring staff meeting at work and a nice daydream. <br/><br/>The reviewers that gripe about historical inaccuracies are way off-base; the movie states at the beginning that it is ""inspired by true events"" and the movie really isn't about the life of J.M. Barrie. It is about finding and losing and finding again the magic of childhood. It shouldn't be judged as a biopic. <br/><br/>There was some criticism over the underdeveloped characters of Barrie's wife Mary and Sylvia's mom Mrs. Du Maurier, the two heavies of the movie. But I disagree. Mrs. Barrie is a rather shallow socialite, but the emotional distance between the couple is shown in gestures and things not said, rather than a lot of expositionary dialog. The scene where she reads his journal and realizes that he has gone somewhere that she could never follow is very moving. Julie Christie as the grouchy and proper Mrs. Du Maurier is softened once she realized that instead of trying to shield her daughter from a scandalous relationship with a married man, she needed to be helping her and the children prepare for her death. <br/><br/>The reviews that talk about the ""implied romance"" between Barrie and Sylvia are missing the point. I did not see a romance developing between them. Barrie falls in love with the entire Llewelyn family. He and Sylvia bond, but it is over their love for the children. His character comes across as asexual. <br/><br/>Is this an Oscar-caliber performance by Johnny? His role is played beautifully, but it fits so seamlessly with the rest of the movie, and it is such a subtle characterization, that I'm actually surprised it's getting as much Oscar buzz as it is. He may have a handicap similar to the one he had last year, when his role was considered by some to be too ""light"" to be serious Oscar material, and he made it look too easy. But he will have the advantage of being in a movie that is definitely Oscar-caliber, so that might give him an advantage he didn't have last year. Lord knows he deserves it.<br/><br/>As for the people who say that it avoids or sugar-coats the whole question of his possible pedophilia (there is conflicting evidence for this) again I say that it is beside the point. There is reference to ""rumors"", but it is consistent with his character to be horrified by the suggestion, and really not concerned what people think of him. Barrie is shown as a damaged soul who never grew up because his childhood was taken from him. He escaped into his fantasy world, his Neverland, and when he meets Peter, the one who took his father's death the hardest and became a cynic at a very young age, he helps him rediscover the magic and comfort of his own imagination."

","Director Marc Forster produces a gem of a screenplay with cinematic dual stage effects that are delightful to see and even more fun to try to figure out. His treatment of a subject that could be taken into many dark corners is at once tragic and enchanting.<br/><br/>Johnnie Depp gives a great performance as the playwright J. M. Barrie. He gives Mr. Barrie a realistic character that none could exceed. Kate Winslet is completely at ease in her role as Mrs Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, the widowed mother of 4 small boys and daughter of Mrs. du Maurier, a domineering mother (played to perfection by Julie Christie). Mr Barrie meets the boys and their mother in a park during one of his frequent visits to walk his dog and write in his journal. His interaction with the boys especially one named Peter is the backdrop to discovering Mr. Barrie's personality.<br/><br/>The joy that Mr. Barrie finds in the interaction with the four Llewelyn Davies boys and some innuendo with Mrs. Llewelyn Davies is tempered by the troubled marriage to his wife Mary, played ably and with a pathos I hadn't expected by Radha Mitchell.<br/><br/>Mr. Barrie enjoys a career in playwriting for producer Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) that has fallen to a low point at the beginning of the movie. Mr. Frohman as foil to Mr. Barrie's ideas and the development of a new play provide a good sidebar to the main storyline. The pre-war era of England in 1903 provides a surreal version of fantasy and real life interacting inside Mr. Barrie and the Llewelyn Davies boys<br/><br/>The most surprising acting in the movie is not by one of the main characters. It is the acting of Freddie Hoffman as Peter Llewelyn Davies that shines.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to all but the most jaded movie goer."

The Strand theater was so beautiful and the other festivities just added so much to the experience. we even had the privilege of hearing from the screenwriters of ""Hook"" and ""Finding Neverland"", to tell us about how they formulated the ideas for the movies. Johnny Depp always surprises me with the many different types of characters he can play and this time was no let down. The kids in this movie are phenomenal and Kate Winslet does a perfect job as the supporting actress. i can't tell you anything more except that i can not wait until October,when it hits all major theaters. <br/><br/>go see it now!!!(...and by now i mean in October...)"
