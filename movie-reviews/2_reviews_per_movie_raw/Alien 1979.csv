","What makes Alien great is it's synchronization of sound, visuals and showing great attention to detail. Not only that but Alien has an unnerving atmosphere right from the beginning. We're introduced to a crew who is not exactly too friendly to each other add to that the ship. It's huge, and with its halls and corridors, it feels almost like a maze.<br/><br/>Enter Alien, a ruthless parasite with humanoid form yet it lacks any civilised traits of a human. It does have humanoid form but it doesn't give a single emotion. The design of the monster is what's the most terrifying (and it still holds up despite Alien being released in 1979). The creature is also better adapted to the ship's interior making a big part of the movie feel like a sinister game of cat and mouse.<br/><br/>What I particularly like is how the characters are written. They are not Hollywoodized heroes, in fact, there is no hero. They're just people which makes them even more threatened. The performances are all equally realistic and do deliver. Kudos to director Ridley Scott for using crafty cinematography and combining it with shadows and lights in an eerie way. The music is unrelenting and combined with Scott's cinematography, sound and visuals it adds to the eeriness.<br/><br/>The plot is also not another Hollywoodized cliché. It's more like ""survival of the fittest"". The characters battle true terror as they race to survive or outlive each other, they're all just a part of a race to see who will prevail and who will die.<br/><br/>Final Rating: 10/10"
"ivo-cobra8","10","129","149","20 February 2018"," One of the best classic sci-fi horror films of all time - A masterpiece
","A masterpiece one of the best classic sci-fi horror films from the 70's I have ever saw and experience. The first time I saw this film was in the 97 when I was 13 years old because this film was so popular that time and even today people talk's about it. Watching the first time this film I must say I loved it. I love this film to death of all the sci-fi films today this one is the best one and beats them all. This is the real science fiction film about ""extraterrestrial life form"" it is interesting, brilliant about time in the space and life form that want's to whip whole humanity out. This is Ridley Scott's masterpiece and one of his best films of all time. Everything about this film is perfect, the script, the actors, puppetry, models, and special effects about Alien design. <br/><br/>I would give this movie an 8 but it deserves a perfect 10 because it has a vision of the most imaginative directors on earth. Dan O'Bannon wrote brilliantly a story and screenplay with help from Ronald Shusett. Both of them make a brilliant imaginative story. This film has no plot holes I don't see them. Helen Horton as the voice of Mother, the Nostromo's computer was believable and realistic and well performed. The design for the parasite (the facehugger) was excellent designed and brilliant. <br/><br/>Everyone from the cast in here at acting is spectacular and acts believable. I love all the characters: Parker, Brett, Lambert, Ripley, Ash, Captain Dallas, Kane and even Jonesy the cat. He was really trained I love that cat in this movie. The design about the ship Nostromo is fantastic and so is space and the computers in this film. The eponymous Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger which the effects and designs were excellent spectacular created in the film. Jerry Goldsmith makes an excellent music score for the film that I have enjoy it. <br/><br/>My favorite scene in this film is when Parker torchers with flamethrower on Ash's corpse and burns his remains great a special effect. This movie stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto, Bolaji Badejo and Helen Horton they are all believable in their roles.<br/><br/>This is my favorite science fiction film tough I prefer Aliens over this film (because it is my favorite film), The Thing, Leviathan even The Blob as a horror films because I enjoy them more but ""Alien"" is my favorite science fiction film the best of it's kind. 10/10 doesn't deserve the hate."

","'Alien' is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, ""lived-in"" look of space-freighter Nostromo's interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) ""retro"" technology inside the ship doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it's the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space). <br/><br/>I feel it's especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time - which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose - and 'Alien' simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It's a testament to the talent of everyone involved, but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger - are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn't just an outstanding, timeless piece of entertainment: it's a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10. <br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/"
"chrishn","9","353","449","6 February 2005"," ""Alien"" is not just the monster, it's the atmosphere and the way you feel!
","In ""Alien"" we follow a seven man crew en-route to earth on board the huge space freighter ""Nostromo"". The crew is in cryosleep, but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. There they make contact with an alien life-form...<br/><br/>What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew is not particularly friendly towards each other, and you truly feel all the in-group tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out industrial-style maze of halls and corridors, and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless, soul-less parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the monster is a stroke of genius. Sure it has a humanoid form, but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence. The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized, plus the creature is more well-adapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. To sum up, you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of in-group tensions, an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of visuals and sounds. <br/><br/>The actors do a superb job, portraying their characters in a subtle but very realistic way. The seven man crew is not a bunch of Hollywood heroes. They are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. In this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with the enemy. <br/><br/>As mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and Ridley Scott adds to the eeriness by using camera movement, lights and shadows in an effective way. The living quarters are bright and should be comfortable to the crew, but there is something sterile about it all. The rest of the ship is basically a huge basement. <br/><br/>The music by Jerry Goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well, and the movie wouldn't have worked without his score. Combined with the sounds of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness. <br/><br/>This is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil. It's a story about ordinary people facing true fear, which is the fear without a face. The fear we can't understand and can't negotiate with, because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. It's a story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by the terror. It's a story where people a killed in a completely random way. There is no higher-order justice behind who gets to live and who dies. All seven characters are just part of a race where the fittest - not necessarily the most righteous - will prevail, and all seven characters start the race on an equal footing. None of them are true heroes, and none of them are true villains. <br/><br/>All the above makes Alien so great as a horror movie. The terror isn't just the Alien itself, it's the entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin, that you just can't shrug it off after the end credits like you can with so many other Hollywood horror movies. The title ""Alien"" doesn't just refer to the monster, it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 9/10"
"Patuquitos","10","724","954","31 January 2005"," The mother of all movies
","Back in early 20th century, Lumière brothers didn't have a clue of what they were playing with. I'm freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work, a movie like 'Alien' would have been made in the future, they both would have died of a sudden, shocked by the consequences of their labor, like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research. In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, 'Alien' is the atomic bomb.<br/><br/>In my opinion, 'Alien' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I've watched since I was born, this is the only one in which I haven't been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid and massive.<br/><br/>I could go on with a panegyric, but I'll try to be short and accurate:<br/><br/>The direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvellous, every movement of the camera is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it, and you spoil it. Seriously.<br/><br/>The acting is splendid. The performances build a credible world centuries away. I don't know about you, but this take on the future was unveliabably acceptable. Sigourney Weaver is more than a revelation, John Hurt is a master, and the rest are nothing short of marvellous.<br/><br/>The script is a work of art, the story is mesmerizing, well-constructed, well-developed, and free of absurd twists. Its simplicity and efectiveness are yet, 25 years after, to be matched.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is pure genius. Gothic, claustrophobic and sometimes baroque. The use of light and dark is beyond description, the use of sound is as creepy as it gets.<br/><br/>The FX are the best possible for 1979. In the time of the release, some scenes were stomach churning.<br/><br/>The score. Jerry Goldsmith's work matches the images so perfectly it seems to bleed from them. It is and will be the best soundtrack for a sci-fi flick in space ever.<br/><br/>The tagline. ""In space, no one can hear you scream"". THIS is a tagline.<br/><br/>And, of course... the alien. The only alive creature that can steal Weaver the movie. Its design is the most innovative I've seen. It has spawned dozens of disgraceful imitations. This is the real deal. Not only the look, but the complete design of a life form, including biological features. Acid instead of blood. Jaws inside jaws. What more could you possibly want? This is how a movie is done.<br/><br/>A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well remembered scenes. Well, 'Alien' has so many that I won't go into it. This movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become an icon itself.<br/><br/>So, what else? I urge all young directors to watch this movie a zillion times, as I've already done, and take notes all along. But not in order to rip off from it, as many others have done, but to learn, learn, learn, learn and learn how a movie should be done. 'Casablanca'? You must be joking.<br/><br/>Oh, I almost forget! There's a lovable cat in it.<br/><br/>RATING: 10"
"oneshotstop","Null","379","526","20 July 1999"," Structural perfection matched only by its hostility
","Director Ridley Scott's well-honed talents of pacing and editing create a tense atmosphere that superbly conveys dread and fear of an unknown, unseen evil entity.  In 1979, the technology didn't exist to generate a computer image of a Being from another world, and thank God, because this film would have sucked just like all these post-Alien creature features do.  Everyone who loves this movie knows what I'm talking about.  Ridley Scott had to be extremely careful not to show a full shot of the Alien, except in very brief scenes, and not to reveal exactly how it moves, because then we would see that it is just some tall, skinny guy in a rubber suit.  Nowadays, some computer guy would whip up a really scary-looking, but nevertheless FAKE-looking (yes, computer guys, we can tell) Alien, and the director would not have to even think about trying to breathe life into H.R. Giger's hallucinations to make a successful picture.<br/><br/>The dark, cold beauty of this film will never be equaled."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","10","156","213","15 April 2004"," Classic tale of terror
","This is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Everything is so carefully and expertly constructed to the point that repeated viewings are just as good as the first. Also, the atmosphere, along with the amazing sets, is real shocker and few movies have managed to create the same kind eerie feeling.<br/><br/>The story starts with the crew of the cargo vessel ""Nostromo"" waking up before schedule. They soon realize their on-board computer has detected life on a nearby planet and they go to investigate. One of them unwillingly brings back an...ALIEN (!) which soon becomes a very unwanted passenger. The introduction of the title creature in the famous chest-burster scene is a real jolter. Especially if you watch it after dinner.<br/><br/>The music, too, must be mentioned and it moves the story along with unrelenting terror. However, the lack of music, in certain scenes, works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.<br/><br/>This is a classic film that spawned a series, which is good overall, and a bunch of copycats, many of which are just sad. ""Alien"" came first and it is easily one the best. 10/10<br/><br/>Rated R: violence/gore and profanity"
"WalterFrith","Null","180","251","22 January 2005"," My favourite tagline for a movie
","""In space, no one can hear you scream."" This remains my favourite tagline ever for a movie. When 'Alien' was released in 1979, it caused almost as much talk as 'Star Wars' did when released two years earlier. The science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and 'Alien' had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological, visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silence not seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 1968. Definitely a big influence in blockbuster film making, 'Alien' has spawned three sequels so far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed. It is director Ridley Scott's best effort on the big screen for making fear the best character in the film."
"bob the moo","Null","245","346","16 October 2001"," Classic horror
","The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this one.<br/><br/>It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.<br/><br/>It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is ""born"" the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)<br/><br/>However here the characters are not merely alien-food but have some dimension to them. Weaver is excellent, while the support cast is full of great support actors (Stanton, Kotto, Hurt, Skerritt, Holm), but of course the real star is the one we see least of.<br/><br/>We barely see the alien in full detail, most of the time it is set in shadows, moving with deadly intent.The alien here is not simply a killing machine as seen in later films but is cruel with it. Witness the alien trap a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg, moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure cruelty.<br/><br/>The film is a study in terror. It may not be as action packed as the other films in the series but it brings the claustrophobia of being hunted to a new level."
"silsworld","10","193","271","30 March 2005"," As Near Perfection As Possible.
","Three words perfectly describe ALIEN: Long, dark and ominous.<br/><br/>You know you're in for a good time when even the opening title gives you a shiver. The music plays perfectly as the word 'ALIEN' slowly appears, line by line. Then there are the establishing shots of the ship; poorly maintained, claustrophobic.<br/><br/>And then there's basically forty minutes of people in a ship pondering and eating and getting along (or not). The film has one little thing that allows it to draw you along so slowly - a promise. A promise made by the advertisements and hype that this was going to kick your ass. You just had to wait.<br/><br/>But when it happens, it happens. Though the film doesn't speed up per se, there's a lot more happening in front of the screen to make it at least look like stuff's going on. The first half crawls almost depressingly, but the second half catches your eye and refuses to let go.<br/><br/>I suggest everyone sees this film. Even if you skip through the beginning, you need to see this. It defined sci-fi and horror all in one.<br/><br/>It's perfect."
"Pluto-3","9","190","268","14 August 1998"," Milestone
","The beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. This film will always remain a classic. It's scary, influential and insanely entertaining. Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There's also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It's fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let's hope they'll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !"
"zetes","10","140","196","6 April 2000"," The Purina Dog Chow company will expand and make a big mistake!
","Ridely Scott is such a minimalist in Alien that many sci-fi nuts find it slow and unexciting. So many people prefer Aliens, its sequel, to this one. I think Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is another sci-fi masterpiece (and maybe the best action film ever made), but I think Alien is much better. In fact, I would say that it is among the best films ever made, in sci-fi, only second to 2001. <br/><br/>The plot absolutely lacks contrivance. All the plot points develop how they would naturally. And there are great surprises throughout the film. Even if you haven't seen the film, you know about the chest-bursting scene. You probably saw it parodied dozens of times. But watch the scene where Ian Holm reveals his secret! That is one amazing scene! I actually saw the sequel first, so I kind of knew that secret, too, but it still shocked me. It was so well directed.<br/><br/>Notice how the dialogue works. It never particularly draws attention to itself. It actually reminds me of Robert Altman, how he directed such movies as Nashville, where many characters are speaking at the same time, and nothing seems more or less important than anything else. It is just like real life. Alien is one of the most realistic, documentary-like sci-fi films ever made. <br/><br/>Also notice the setting. The Nostromo's design is so believable that I feel that I'm actually seeing a real space vehicle. The alien ship also beams with its spookiness.<br/><br/>The characters are also extremely believable. They are so well written that even the first character who dies is completely developed. If you get the DVD, they actually created dossiers about each of the crew members. It also has extra scenes which round out the characters even more. I think Ripley is one of the most endearing characters in film history. Even in the last two sequels, which were visually interesting but not very well written or directed, Ripley held my interest. I teared up when she died at the end of 3. If they made a fifth one, I would go, no matter how terrible I knew it would be. The acting is also top-notch. Ian Holm, a great actor, gives one of his best performances here. I love the last scene that he is in. Truly a master. And of course Sigourney Weaver could have just as easily been nominated for an Oscar for her performance here as she was for Aliens. I wish she would make more movies. She's so talented.<br/><br/>The most important part of a film, in my mind, is the mood. And boy, does Alien have one of the most genuinely spooky movies I've ever seen. Make sure you watch it after the sun has gone down. Also, watching it alone will help. The special effects are kind of cheap, but Scott knows this well enough. He only shows the alien for seconds at a time. Besides keeping us from seeing the shoddiness of those puppets, this technique makes the alien seem all the more creepy and mysterious. <br/><br/>10/10, no doubt at all (BTW, the symbols all over the Nostromo are the same insignias as those of the Purina Dog Chow company)"
"gftbiloxi","10","172","245","23 April 2005"," Iconographic Horror
","ALIEN received mixed reviews when it debuted in 1979--largely from science fiction critics, who accused it of being little more than a sort of Friday the 13th in Outer Space, a blood-and-gore horror flick given a futuristic twist via special effects. But while these accusations have more than a little truth, it has been an incredibly influential film--and even today, in the wake of CGI effects, it still holds up extremely, extremely well.<br/><br/>The story is well known: the crew of an interstellar craft responds to what seems a distress signal, only to encounter a remarkably lethal alien life form that boards their ship and sets about picking them off one by one. Some of the special effects are weak (the alien spacecraft and the android ""revival"" are fairly notorious). There is little in the way of character development, the film has a fairly slow pace, and the story itself is predictable; you can usually guess who is going to die next.<br/><br/>BUT. The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself (brilliantly envisioned by Giger) is right on the money. Director Ridley Scott encouraged his cast to ad lib from the script, and the result is a shocking sense of realism--and the somewhat slow pace of the film and the predictability of the story gives it a sense of relentless and ever-mounting paranoia that is greatly enhanced by the tight sets and camera set-ups. With its odd mixture of womb-like organics and cold mechanics, ALIEN is a film calculated to send even the most slightly claustrophobic viewer into a fit of hysteria.<br/><br/>The entire cast, led by Tom Skerrit and Sigorney Weaver, is very, very good--and the film abounds with memorable images and scenes ranging from John Hurt's encounter with the alien egg to Skerrit's search of the ship air ducts to Weaver's terrifying race against time as the ship counts down to self-destruct. Seldom has any film been so consistent in design, cast, direction, and out-and-out fear factor, and although certain aspects of ALIEN are open to legitimate criticism the end result is powerful enough to bring it in at a full five stars. A word of warning, however: you'll need to send the kids to bed for this one. And you'll probably be up half the night afterward yourself! Recommended.<br/><br/>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
"Infofreak","Null","192","275","12 December 2002"," A horror classic that has stood the test of time! Still by far the best movie in the series.
","'Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatest horror/suspense movies ever made. Ridley Scott is now one of the most well known and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think anything he's made in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a near masterpiece in my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like, those being his first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is long past his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work, and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al, an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects, including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors and not ""stars"" so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done, 'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now, but when the movie was first released she was virtually unknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto ('Blue Collar') and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') as the wise cracking ""below deck"" crew. Many people seem to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie, and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend highly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!"
"shortround8391","10","39","51","17 April 2009"," Alien.....the one that started it all........
","Alien....the creature......the film.....the legend. The one that started it all, the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever made, one that got a comic book mini-series and 2 cross-over films with ""Predator"". This is THE film. And without a doubt, the greatest horror film ever created, and this totally makes ""Halloween"" look like ""Chicken Little"". You can forget about all those rubbish ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies, 'cause ""Alien"" just takes horror up to so many levels! In ""Alien"", we find ourselves in the distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis, their ship picks up an ""SOS"" from a nearby planet, and once the crew is awakened, they are forced by the ""Company"" regulations to follow that signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that something terrifying is in store for them, when a hostile organism attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on, it becomes clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a horrible, violent death from a deadly breed of an other-worldly life-form. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.<br/><br/>As other classic films should always have, ""Alien"" does great on the characters. And of course, the most recognizable one is the lead woman, Ellen Ripley who is played then-unknown Sigourney Weaver. She provides a very human face and you're gonna feel like you're actually watching a real-life woman in here, and it could be because of her accent, or her mannerisms. But as the film progresses, she develops into a more mentally tougher woman while combating the Alien. There are times when she totally keeps it cool, times when she's afraid, times when she's angry, and times when its just Ripley being Ripley. And thanks to Weavers acting talents, she can really dish out one hell of a character.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast are nothing short of spectacular, Parker and Brett are the selfish, sarcastic men who only want to make a profit. And through most of the film, you can feel the tension that Ripley and Parker have. Lambert, who one of my favorites from here is the second woman who happens to be the opposite of Ripley, a total coward. Dallas, who the viewer might get the vibe that HE is the main character in the 1st 15 minutes or so, is pretty much the leader here. Kane, is the tired, dead-looking guy who is the one that carries the alien species inside of him. And finally, Ash is the one with the sinister purpose and you start to suspect that he's up to no good at some point. And movie characters need to have their own personalities and that's what ""Alien"" has.<br/><br/>And as for the Alien itself, well what can i say? It is the most horrifying creature in the history of cinema, period. I mean, how could you stop it? It has acid for blood, and is very lethal to fight face-to-face. And the special effects were over 20 years ahead of its time. The face-hugger on Kane looked so freaking real, that you're gonna be scared just by looking at it, even it doesn't do anything except breathe most of the time. And the sets couldn't have been better, very futuristic, yet there's always something ominous and dark about them.<br/><br/>The suspense is impossible to resist as the sequences deliver the chills at times when you least expect it, and when you do expect something to happen, nothing happens. And ""Alien"" is one of the very few horror films that understands that you can't scare people by raking up the bodies and the blood, but you have to build up the suspense to do it. And director Ridley Scott is such a genius, and he shows that here, he absolutely knows how to make any kind of film, ones that can scare (Alien), one that can sadden (Thelma and Louise), and one that can excite/thrill (Gladiator). And Ridley really keeps up the dark atmosphere, especially in the beginning when there's no talking for the 1st 5 minutes or so, we get the feeling that something's not right all the time. Some parts are very quiet and very depressing and we feel exactly what we see.<br/><br/>This is the legend that I'm talking about here, folks. Don't miss the chance to see this, because it will scare the living daylights outta you more than any other movie you're gonna see in your life. Take my word for it....I'm practically a movie buff, so I know what I'm talking about...."
"exterminator_99","Null","70","101","12 March 2002"," The original masterpiece that launched a dynasty
","As the credits of ""Alien"" open, the slowly paced opening titles and soft, eerie score give some indication of what viewers will experience when watching this film.  It starts off so unassumingly that first-time viewers are unlikely to be moved by the story or inspired by the slight character development in the film's first half.  It is in fact this lack of certainty that makes ""Alien"" work so well, for as the film hits it second half it shifts dramatically from slow space road movie to an intergalactic haunted house fright show.  This flip in drama, pace and tension makes for an unnerving ride into the unknown and results in one of the landmark sub-genre-sci-fi movies of the 20th century.<br/><br/> The film is directed by Englishman Ridley Scott, who had a total of one feature and numerous commercials under his belt when he took control of proceedings.  Since the success of ""Alien"", Scott has had an uneven career with highlights like ""Blade Runner"", ""Thelma and Louise"", ""Gladiator"" and most recently ""Black Hawk Down"" and low points like ""Legend"", ""G.I. Jane"" and the bore-fest ""1492"".  ""Alien"" represents the overtly stylistic and slick approach Scott brings to his films, traits that are useful in science fiction but can sometimes seem out of place in more realistic genres.<br/><br/> Here Scott retires the glitz and glamour of ""Star Wars"", which had been released two years before ""Alien"".  Instead he portrays the spacecraft and crew as nothing more than a cargo ship and a rag tag bunch of intergalactic truckers.  This works very well, as the viewer gets the distinct sense of the tedium and oppressive vastness of space travel.  The way the crew are so nonchalant about visiting another planet makes the audience feel that yes, perhaps one day man will view space travel with a shrug.<br/><br/> The opening scene shows us a huge spaceship, named the Nostromo, returning to earth with 20,000,000 tonnes of mineral ore on board.  The crew sleep in hibernation, until the onboard computer awakens them.  It seems the computer has picked up a possible distress signal on an alien planet.  Under the law of the nameless and faceless 'Company', the crew are obliged to investigate.<br/><br/> The waking scene is superbly filmed.  Kane (John Hurt) slowly rises, like a chick from and egg.  Squinting and only partially awake, slow dissolves from one angle of Kane to another emphasise his delirium and partial consciousness.  The final dissolve dissipates to the mess hall.  Here we meet the entire crew of the Nostromo for the first time.<br/><br/> The ship is led by Dallas (Tom Skerrit), with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) as the first officer.  Ash (Ian Holm) is the odd, skittish science officer, Kane (John Hurt) is weathered but adventurous, Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) is the whiny and weak navigation officer, and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) are the engineering grunts.  The ship is controlled by Mother, a mute version of HAL 9000 from 1968's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  Like ""2001"", the reasons for having humans on board is unknown; they almost seem pointless as the ship can basically control itself.  Are they simply pawns or guinea pigs awoken at the will of the computer?<br/><br/> They respond to the distress signal after landing on the desolate planet. The beacon is tracked to a derelict spaceship, which Kane, Lambert and Dallas enter.  Curious and naïve, Kane wonders into a cavern of eggs. Stumbling on the slippery surface, he slips and comes into contact with the living contents of the egg.  With the parasite attached to his face, Dallas and Lambert rush Kane back to the ship.<br/><br/> On board Ripley, who is now in command, demands that Kane be kept in quarantine for 24 hours.  Against her wishes, the odd Ash lets the three crew in.  Upon removing Kane's helmet they find a claw shaped being attached to his face.  It eventually falls off and dies and amazingly, Kane awakens, seemingly unscathed.<br/><br/> At this stage the film remains slow and ponderous.  Intent on getting back to earth, they have one final meal before returning to hibernation.  As they eat Kane convulses violently and a creature bursts through his chest.  In utter disbelief the crew watch it skuttle away to the far reaches of the ship.<br/><br/>From this point the film takes off.  Space and distance are enclosed as Scott uses a brilliant mix of close ups and wide angled shots to display the vastness of the Nostromo and the claustrophobia in the crew.<br/><br/> The alien and set design are outstanding.  The massive sexual overtones of Swiss artist's H.R. Giger's alien and derelict ship are truly breathtaking, as is the futuristic-retro styling of Michael Seymour's sets.  Grubby yet cool, the production quality of ""Alien"" is something to admire.<br/><br/> It took seven more years before a sequel was made and when James Cameron took over the directing chair he revolutionised the series by making it all out action over spooky sci-fi with ""Aliens"".  It may be a better movie, but the original remains a quality stand alone film and a landmark in the sci-fi horror sub genre that has not been matched by any other saga."
"BrandtSponseller","10","65","99","6 February 2005"," A new appreciation of this film's excellence
","Seven members of a space mining cargo ship who are headed back to Earth are awakened from hypersleep when their ship detects a signal from an intelligent civilization on a small, uncharted planet. When they locate the source of the signal, they find more than they bargained for, and all of their lives are endangered.<br/><br/>My feelings about this first film in the Alien series have vacillated slightly over the years. I loved it when I first saw it as a young teenager in the theater back in 1979. Later, I wasn't as enamored with it, and had actually rated it as low as a 7 out of 10--at one point believing it to be my least favorite of the series. Now, however, my appreciation of the film has matured a bit, and I'm back to thinking it's a solid 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>The film's strong points are rooted in director Ridley Scott's focused commitment to sustaining a desolate, dark atmosphere and gradually building suspense over the course of the film. Alien is unusual for its era in its pacing, its lack of comic relief, and its refusal to provide breaks from its growing tension. All three of these facts make it a somewhat ""difficult film"". It's not recommended for light viewing. It's not a ""popcorn film"". You have to be in the mood to sit down, slow down, concentrate, invest emotion, and let yourself be enveloped in the film's world.<br/><br/>With Alien, Scott has created a kind of bleak tribute to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). This is evident in many characteristics of the film, such as the graceful slowness of the cinematography, editing and much of the action in the first section of the film, including sustained pans across sterile-looking environments and wide external shots of (a) hulking but elegant spacecraft, the personification of the ship's computer, known as ""Mother"" here rather than Hal, a few subtle instances of classical music, the surprise discovery of a monumental structure on another celestial body, and so on. <br/><br/>However, there are no instances of pleasant psychedelia here, no retreats into dreamworlds, no messages of hope, no benevolence from alien beings. Alien is strictly concerned with making its sci-fi an issue of classic horror. At a base level, it is about a malevolent monster, first encountered in a dark, Gothic environment and later chasing our heroes through a cross between a haunted house and crypt-like labyrinths.<br/><br/>Much has been said about visual artist H.R. Giger's alien and production design, and the film wouldn't be nearly as successful without it. Giger is largely responsible for the look of the beacon ship on the small planet, both its exterior and interior, the cocoon later encountered on the cargo ship, and the creatures. His work also inspired a lot of smaller elements, as can be seen in doorways, pipes, and other features of the cargo ship. Like most of his work, these features are a combination of metallic and organic, mechanical and biological, futuristic and Gothic. They complement the austere Kubrickian sensibility in a surprising but completely successful way.<br/><br/>Scott also uses simple effects like steam, as well as unique lighting and sound effects to help build the film's thick tension. These techniques gradually become more conspicuous as the film goes on, finally culminating in a claustrophobic symphony of flashing lights, constantly hissing pipes and hoses, and an incessant audio alarm.<br/><br/>Finally, the last key to the excellence of the film is the cast. Although a somewhat stereotypical movie-world ragtag bunch, their characterizations provide more depth than the norm, with Sigourney Weaver as the standout, in perhaps the defining role of her career, and one of the more admirable filmic portrayals of a woman--she's the smartest, most sensible, strongest, and certainly most sexy of the bunch."
"nycritic","10","26","37","18 February 2006"," This Ageless, Silent, Haunted House Floating in Silent Space
","Before gore, special effects, and the denouement of the alien itself in future sequels, this was the movie that revolutionized the concept of the ""haunted house"" and merged it in a seamless sieve with ""body horror"" and its ultimate intrusion into our own most intimate space.<br/><br/>The story had been done before, in different genres, never veering too far from its horror origins. Lovecraft (and others) had written about expeditions that had gone to ""investigate"" and ""collect important data"" only to find themselves being hunted down one by one, be it an unseen terror or their own fears.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's ALIEN looks and feels like a science fiction movie. However, it is not. Everything in its look and tone suggests horror of a more cerebral kind. When three crew members come across what seems to be a large space-jockey with a thing attached to its face, dead, we feel our stomach turn. If something that small was able to take over a creature this large, they are in deep trouble here. The scene is masterful, restrained, but a classic in the horror-movie sense: it's as if we had been witness to terrible events which had taken place and decided to get to the bottom of it. Scott tightens the noose employing age-old tricks of the horror genre and only once shows blood and guts -- one which follows a calm dinner sequence. He never allows the viewer to get a true glimpse of this sadistic killer much like Spielberg in JAWS and this becomes nerve-wracking because again, fear of the unseen is more powerful than what comes into view. The theory dictates: ""I was afraid of that thing? I thought it was bigger!"" All we see of this alien are his teeth and in one memorable, twisted scene, his tail snaking up Lambert's (Veronica Cartwright) leg. Later on, as Ripley (Sigourney Weaver in her breakthrough role), the quintessential Final Girl, makes her escape, it is possible to hear Lambert shrieking. What the alien is doing to her we can only imagine and recoil."
"philipwest89","10","16","22","19 September 2011"," Thirty-two years on, and still exceptional.
","In the crowded gallery of horror films, Alien hangs in a prominent position, high above its rivals. By virtue of its deft blend of psychology and physical horror, it lifts the genre out of the graveyard and into deepest space . While its scale models, grimy characters, and shimmering soundtrack may no longer appeal to a generation of audiences who revel in the hotchpotch storyboards of 'Drag Me To Hell', Alien still commands great respect, and rightly so. It has not lost any of its cutting edge, even after thirty-two years. <br/><br/>Alien's simplistic premise keeps the film tight and lean; a taut, slow-burning game of cat and mouse involving a vicious, shadowy creature whose acidic blood can melt the very girders of the ship it has invaded, and a compelling blend of the brave (Ripley), cautious (Dallas), and mechanical (Ash). There are no meaningless references to childhood memories or superfluous romance. The characters and their personalities are weathered, believable, and their mission plausible. The profit-driven search for mineral ore provides a realistic corporate counterpoint to the main story, which sees the seven crew members dragged, somewhat unwillingly, into the extraterrestrial's world. With the possible exception of Ash, they did not seek this encounter; the computers lead them to it. How each crew member responds to the situation is key; in effect, seven sub plots form, each focusing upon something different, be it a crew member's mannerisms, their way of thinking, or indeed, a violent death (Chestburster). This is Alien's greatest appeal; it provides an insight into the human mind, as psychological horror movies should. Which crew member do we, the audience, root for, admire, or resent? Who can trust who? <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver, so often credited with inspiring a roll-call of female cinematic heroines, rightly earns every syllable of praise that has been heaped upon her since the film's release; Ripley's resourcefulness and courage are marvellous to behold. However, as the genuinely disturbing android Ash, Ian Holm is supreme; his reserved demeanour and considered approach masking the motives that lay hidden out of sight. <br/><br/>As an exercise in sound and vision, Alien is a memorable spectacle. There are many moments that are striking. The colossal hauler Nostromo, futuristic and industrial in design, dominates the screen as it crawls slowly, almost gracefully, towards Earth. The sheen of the soundtrack and the echoing calls from the freighter to 'Antarctica Traffic Control' are atmospheric to the core, while the fogbound alien planet, littered with blackened mountains and the silhouette of the hulking, derelict vessel, is hauntingly desolate. Spaces where, in modern horror films, the gaps would be filled with meaningless dialogue, are left vacant. The viewer can interpret what they see with no need for speech. Ridley Scott's vision of 'horror first, science-fiction second' was, without a doubt, fulfilled; audiences should ignore the flashing lights and controls of the spaceship and focus upon the Alien. Around which corner does it lurk? Who becomes its next victim? <br/><br/>Alien is a film of immense quality. It has the capacity to frighten and to deceive. It flows precisely from scene to scene with no wasted shots and most tellingly, does not stray off course by incorporating fanciful special effects or worthless roles filled by fringe characters. One spacecraft, one extraterrestrial, seven humans, and one cat is all we are given. And quite simply, anything more would have been a waste. While the genre of horror may have moved on, the art of horror is captured perfectly, here, in the blackness of space."

"LordBlacklist","10","16","24","5 March 2006"," The Quiet Beginning
","Review 1 of 4<br/><br/>Alien is one of those films that will never age. It takes the simplest story and tells it as well as it can be told. I look at this film as the first in a trilogy, many may not agree with that, but Alien is a perfect beginning. It establishes an entire world and makes it feel real. Everything feels new and interesting. The things that are not explained in this film are exactly what makes it so fascinating to watch. Where did that ship come from? It doesn't matter. Like a good novel the film allows you to fill in the pieces with your own imagination. This goes for the alien it self, since we see so little of it that it becomes all the more terrifying for it. Ridley Scott is like a painter with his images. So many frames of this picture seem like they could be made into still photographs. Alien is science fiction and yet with the way it is shot and acted the movie feels like a documentary. It's that sense of verisimilitude that has made this movie last for so long. So much is present in the subtext. I get the feeling that one of the underlying themes of the film is that technology in the future will little by little overtake the lives of human beings, but paradoxically the nostromo still needs a crew in order to operate. I believe this film is one of the few realistic depictions of what encountering a real Alien life form might actually be like, and that it may not be what we are expecting. something that has always stood out to me about the film is the level of familiarity that the characters have with their surroundings. Many science fiction films love to draw attention to their futuristic technology but the characters in Alien react to it like a construction worker would with operating a crane: it is their job. This film is so good for so many reasons. The performances are nothing short of amazing, the set design exquisite, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is subtle and evocative, but the main reason for me that alien still holds up after all these years is that it takes itself very seriously. There is no Hollywood style self referential humor that would saturate the later entries of the series. Sigourney Weaver may have gotten the academy award nomination for Aliens, but her work here is very solid. She plays a character who through much hardship finds strength within herself that never appeared to be there to begin with. If you look at the Alien series as a trilogy this is the film where Ripley discovers who she really is, or defines her character, and the only way one can do that is through the choices they make in extreme circumstances. This is a film of great tension and subtly, well worth seeing over and over again to pick up on all the layers of subtext that may have been missed the first or second viewing."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","21","33","31 July 2004"," Whose idea was it to bring a cat in the first place?
","I'm a little confused as to why there was a cat on board in the first place. Needless to say, given that there was an entire crew on board the Nostromo, a merchant vessel carrying, if I remember correctly, something like 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore, there was hardly a lack of companionship. At any rate, I can easily brush aside my curiosity about the effort that went into designing the life support system that would have been needed to keep the cat alive along with the rest of the humans as they traveled for months on end in deep sleep. It doesn't matter, because the cat was involved in most of the scariest scenes. <br/><br/>That being said, I think that one of the things that really makes Alien great is that it explains all the twists and turns of its plot in great detail, which is almost unheard of in science fiction and horror films. No one displays ludicrous behavior to allow for the construction of bloody, gory death scenes, the alien, masterfully designed, isn't rushing across the screen in every scene to allow for maximum payoff of the costume design, we don't even see it until well past the halfway point in the movie. Like Jaws, Alien takes its time to allow the characters to gradually grasp the enormity of their situation. <br/><br/>The Nostromo is a merchant ship, which allows for a non-military crew to be faced with a mortal enemy that they do not understand. The ship intercepts a strange transmission that must be from an intelligent source since it repeats itself every twelve seconds, and so it wakes up the crew to investigate. The subtlety of the way the conflict is introduced is very important. The transmission didn't just appear, the ship awoke the crew months ahead of schedule, because it was programmed to do so should anything like that happen. And to the chagrin of a couple of the money financial-minded crew members, it is also in their contracts to investigate any such occurrence. The movie is covering its tracks very thoroughly and to great effect. <br/><br/>When they reach the planet from which the transmission originated, they find the spectacular discovery of what appears to be a crashed alien spaceship, complete with a dead alien pilot still in his chair. A brief look at the body suggests that the pilot may have exploded from the inside, creating curiosity about his death that the movie never satisfies but doesn't need to. One of the crew members discovers what look like dozens of leathery eggs, gets attacked, and is brought back on board the ship. Significantly, protocol is broken to get him and the alien life form back on board for medical attention. <br/><br/>When they discover that the alien has blood that melts through the hull of the ship like thermite, a new and particularly difficult challenge arises. How do they kill a deadly enemy without making it bleed? And to make matters worse, the very ship is programmed to work against them. They are in the most hostile environment imaginable, worse than anywhere on earth. They are being stalked by an unknown creature that they can't injure for fear of damaging the hull of the spaceship, and the ship itself has placed the survival of the alien life form above their own survival. They have to trick the alien into submission without letting the ship know what's going on. Even HAL wasn't THIS creepy.<br/><br/>Released at a time when science fiction was probably at the most popular that it had ever been (and possibly ever will be) thanks to the recent release of Star Wars and the soon to follow first sequel, Alien came along and capitalized in an area of science fiction that people evidently were very eager for, the darker, more sinister and dangerous side. The side of science fiction with the bloody deaths rather than light sabers and heroes. In fact, by looking at the way people probably saw Alien in 1979 and the way they see it now, you can learn a lot about how science fiction and horror have evolved over the years. Back then, this was horror/science fiction. Today, it's science fiction/horror. But while it was more horrible in 1979 than it is today, it is significant that, while other films that have come along over the years have overshadowed Alien as far as the intensity of the horror, the movie has lost none of its powerful effect. Rather than reinventing the science fiction genre by adding horror to it, it is now maintaining the life of the science fiction genre by reminding us of how good it can be when it's done right."
"funkyfry","7","18","29","22 August 2006"," Solid suspense film set in space
","This is one of the few sci-fi horror films from the period of the late 70s/early 80s that has really held up with time.<br/><br/>On a visual level, the film is highly satisfying. Green and light blue colors are saturated throughout the film, but so grayed that the movie almost appears at many points to be shot in black and white. The miniatures and matte effects used in the original film were quite good.<br/><br/>The movie works on pretty much every level, though you can't really say it's an incredible story either. On a sci-fi level, the best parts are the early parts where we first see the alien technology. I was disappointed actually in the print that I saw because I believe it was altered with computers, I remember seeing more matte screens that resembled the HR Geiger artwork when the film was on video. Anyway, the alien technology succeeds on a level never before achieved in terms of showing a realistic alien culture. We can almost imagine these creatures living on this ship, it seems to fit in with the alien biology so well.<br/><br/>When they arrive back on their own ship, the film unfortunately descends into a fairly typical horror action film. Perhaps taking a note from Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", Scott kills off the only reasonably well known actor in the film (at the time of its release), Tom Skerrit, fairly quickly and leaves us with the then-unknown Weaver as the hero. This makes her the first really butt-kicking female heroine of a sci-fi action film, and that alone qualifies this film as groundbreaking.<br/><br/>The cast in general is just amazing. Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton -- these are quite simply some of the best character actors of their generation, all gathered for the purpose of making this more than just a typical monster movie. Other films such as ""Predator"" tried but failed to get a supporting cast as distinguished and talented as this one gathered for a sci-fi action film. The quality of these actors makes the film better not only in the individual scenes they are in (such as Holm's incredible turn once exposed), but also the aggregate total of the film -- because the actors are so good and the characters relatively fleshed out, we can imagine right up until the film's final moments that any one of them could be the one who ends up surviving.<br/><br/>Another interesting element not often commented on is the cynical attitude the astronauts have towards ""the company"", which employs them. From Kotto and Stanton's character's complaints about the hours, all the way up to Weaver's discovery that all of them were expendable and kept in the dark as to the true purpose of their mission (which Skerrit's character seems to also know more about than Weaver's), there is a kind of dark realism here that you won't find in the vast majority of films of this type. It dovetails with the other element I've talked about, the fact that the cast is so good that any one of them could be the ""hero"" -- this is a very democratic look at the future, one edged with deep cynicism but with an ultimate eye towards presenting a future of real people who are oppressed by situations far beyond their control. It is a far cry from the Utopian dreams of Heinlein and other sci-fi progenitors and represents this film's true gift to science fiction as a whole."

"willwoodmill","9","6","8","14 February 2016"," Defining moment in sci-fi horror history
","Alien is one indisputably one of the best science fiction, and horror films ever made. And easily one of the most influential ever. As it basically invented and defined the science- fiction horror genre, paving the way for films like the thing, and predator. <br/><br/>One of Alien's best aspects is its amazing cinematography and creature/set design. All of see work together to give the film a visual style that was unlike anything scene at the time and Ridley Scott would re-use in Blade Runner. Alien's magnificent visuals can be strangely credited to Alejandro Jodorowsky, who found and assembled all the different artists used in Alien for his adaptation of the novel dune, which was unfortunately canned before shooting started, but every cloud has a silver lining, and Jodorowsky's Dune's silver lining was Alien. <br/><br/>Another one of Alien's best aspects is its pacing and atmosphere, though some people today may call Alien ""boring,"" these people know nothing about film and are not to be trusted. Alien opens with a slow footage of space, as the eerie score plays, open credits come up, and the title is slowly spelled out, this is then followed by a slow montage of the empty ship Nostromo, followed by the crew slowly waking up from cryospleep. In fact we don't see any sign of an alien until 1/3 of the way through the film, and we don't see the main alien until halfway through the film. And this is why some call it ""boring,"" but these people came to see the wrong film, they expected something like predator, a straight forward action film where the hero tries to kill the creature, instead what they got was something more like Halloween or Psycho, a subtle unnerving film that builds tension and doesn't blow its load all at once.<br/><br/>The characters in Alien are also far above the average horror movie, they aren't annoying teenagers, or people that we just want to see die. They're relatable diverse logical characters, that have really natural chemistry, as can be seen in some of the films earlier scenes. And another interesting thing about the characters is, we have to figure out which one the protagonist is, it isn't revealed immediately and makes all lot of scenes much more tense because we don't know which characters are going to die. <br/><br/>Though Alien begins slow, the final scenes of Alien are some of the most ""on the edge of your seat"" scenes ever, I don't won't to spoil anything for anyone who somehow hasn't scene alien yet, but you will most likely be on the verge of a heart attack while watching.<br/><br/>One final note, I recommend you watch the original version first, and then you most definitely should watch the directors cut.<br/><br/>9.6/10"

","How can this movie not get 10 stars? It baffles me. In context, this one came out in 1979. 19 F----ng 79. And it still stands up awesomely today. Let us first investigate the Ash. When did we first realize he was an android? When the milky fluid came spurting from him. Although he was often ""collating"" we never really suspected until his head was bashed in proper. What an incredible character Ian Holmes created. And those little pre-exercise jiggles he did. We just thought he was a bit off, certainly not a robot. And Ripley, a strong female lead. And though the scenes of her in her panties were anti-feminist, she still was the lone survivor, who kicked the Alien out of the airlock. She kicked a-- and everyone will always remember that, especially James Cameron. And what about Tom Skerritt? As captain, he always left the science decision to Ash, as he was instructed to do by the company. He felt he was, ""just the captain,"" though he did ignore basic contamination protocols by letting Caine in with the Alien attached to his face. His acting was perfect, a man who only knows the job he is hired for, compartmentalized, weak, and yet ultimately courageous in his decision to go after the Alien. And Parker and Brett were perfect. Pay attention to how their camaraderie is condensed into a few beautiful scenes. Ridley Scott should be credited for this, as we really get to know the friendship between them quite quickly (as James Cameron does in Aliens). Lambert is great in her nervousness. This is as good an any movie can get, a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, sorry for the spoilers, but rent as soon as possible, it is a piece of American Cinematic History."
"anders-rock","10","8","12","29 May 2011"," Creepy, well made and haunting
","Every second of this movie gives me the shivers. Even in the slow moving first half the atmosphere is so ominous and creepy and the acting so excellent that I'm never bored. The movie builds up the tension so masterfully you're on the edge of your seat all the time. I've heard some people say that the effects are dated to which I will answer: No not really. The monster is a man in a suit with some mechanics in the head and while there are a few shots where it's movements seem a little stiff we rarely see it and when we do it's only for a short duration and it actually in many ways looks more real than most CGI creatures of today. The artwork and design is one of the reasons this movie holds up so well to me. The ship looks appropriately old and battered up and the alien itself is pure genius. This movie just keeps thrilling me every time I watch it."
"secondtake","8","8","12","7 July 2009"," The First of a New Sci-Fi Horror Breed
","Alien (1979)<br/><br/>The First of a New Sci-Fi Horror Breed<br/><br/>It's hard to believe how fresh and scary this movie was at the time, but it's also a relief to see it still holds up as a well made movie even now. Is it a classic great movie? Almost, almost. But not quite, in the end--mostly because of some clichés and goofs in the acting and dialog--although it has really great moments. And it's a great way to discover director Ridley Scott's unique style.<br/><br/>Certainly now that H. R. Giger the artist has gotten famous in his own right, the alien itself deserve special mention. And the sets are impressively otherworldly and familiar at the same time--not only the huge and hugely baroque ship, but the interior scenes on the planet toward the beginning. These are marvels whether or not your style (and for my money, the alien is a really improbable type of extraterrestrial, more at home in a comic book Hades than actual space). Another novelty to note, probably a product of the shift in movies in general since the 1960s, is the director's intention to keep things real and everyday. Things are dirty, people worry about their paychecks, and so on. <br/><br/>This is a long way from the sterility of 2001 though head to head the earlier Kubrick film is on another level of art. I know a lot of people would rather be entertained, though, and Alien is entertaining. It's fast, it's scary, it's gory, it's messy. It's surprising. It's beautiful. And it spawned a whole series of follow-ups, the next one confusingly called Aliens (1986), also a very good take on the new genre.<br/><br/>I first saw this when it came out in Colorado and it was on a huge, curving screen that wrapped around the audience, and I was really, truly scared. Now, thirty years later, the scary parts are still really scary, and it's edited so quickly you won't spend more than a minute on any one scene that doesn't quite click. Horror sci-fi has never been the same since."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","11","18","15 December 2005"," Exemplary horror (spoilers)
","What makes Alien such an effective horror film is how quiet it is. After all, most horror films make the mistake of equating fear with noise. But that's often a mistake, as silence is usually infinitely more effective. And so it is with Alien. The scariest moments are all devoid of intrusive scoring, jagged editing and overblown sound effects. Instead most of the sound and music is pulled out and shots are held for a long time.<br/><br/>One of the best examples is when Brett is killed. He has to chase after a cat and he's led into a dark corner of the ship. You know he's going to get killed but Ridley Scott knows that you know. Therefore the sequence is dragged out. All the time you're waiting. You're waiting for the inevitable. But Scott doesn't rush things. He racks up the tension by having Brett wander for an inordinate length of time and by having him wash his face in a shower of dripping water as chains rattle in the background. And when the Alien does appear, it's not with a sudden jolt. It just appears quietly behind Brett before killing him. And the way that the death is played on the face of the cat, which has a look of almost stunned curiosity, makes the whole sequence rather spooky. It's not really a crash, bang, wallop sort of horror film.<br/><br/>Not that there aren't plenty of jump moments. There are actually quite a few. But because the lead-up is so quiet and ominous it makes the pay-off a whole more effective. For example, when Kane looks into the egg. Again the sequence takes its time, but when he finally has a peek and the facehugger leaps out, it has the perfect timing of a great joke.<br/><br/>Another fantastic piece of timing is when the Alien takes Dallas. You go through another long, drawn out sequence of him scurrying through narrow air vents before the Alien finally pops out of a dark corner. But although the moment is fantastically timed, the lead up is where the fun lies. Although I do have to say that the lead up is probably the most frightening thing in the film. Dallas scurries through narrow corridors trying to take the Alien out, but you know it's futile. And the dark, claustrophobic corridors are full of iris-shaped doors that open and close slowly and forebodingly, which really does add to the air of dread that fills the sequence. And the tracker is the icing on the cake  it racks up the tension to an even greater extent.<br/><br/>The second most frightening sequence is when Ripley is finally alone in the ship. She sets the Nostromo to self-destruct so that she can take the shuttle but then with strobe lights flashing she sees the Alien. She then goes back and tries to reverse the self-destruct sequence, but it's too late. It's frightening because Ripley has to run around the ship, not knowing where the Alien might be. No longer does she have the option of just hiding. And with everyone dead she no longer has anyone to talk to or help her out. She's all alone. But perversely, once everyone's dead, the film finally gets loud. There's a countdown sequence (which is brilliant in the way that it adds tension) and the ship begins to destruct. Just when Ripley might have needed the silence to find out where the Alien is, she has to run around in cacophony of noise knowing that the Alien could be anywhere.<br/><br/>But the silence comes back in the final sequence, and it's quite ingenious the way that the Alien is camouflaged in the shuttle. I nearly messed myself when I first saw it as a kid.<br/><br/>What I also like about the final sequence is that it's weirdly sexual. Ripley strips down to her underwear and then the Alien appears. And the Alien then begins almost stroking the console it's resting on. And of course, Ripley penetrates the Alien a harpoon. Nice.<br/><br/>Another excellent bit of weird sexuality is when Ash the robot tries to choke Ripley with a magazine. He shoves it her mouth and he looks rather turned on as she gags on it. Perhaps robots don't come with all the parts. Perhaps this is his way of venting his frustration. But there's also the way that the Alien kills Lambert. Its tail inches up the insides of her thigh and then you cut away and hear her screaming like she's being violated  the screaming is actually pretty damn chilling. And of course, Kane getting ripped open goes back to the male fear of childbirth. (The birth scene is still great. The blood, the sound and the way it takes the Alien two or three attempts to burst through is fantastic. But I do have to say that the way the Alien shoots off the table looks rather dodgy.) <br/><br/>Going back to the Lambert killing, though As well as being chilling, this scene is also quite frustrating because Parker (Yaphet Kotto) gets killed as well. I mean, Parker is just The Man. I swear he could have taken the Alien had it not been for the cowardly Lambert. (It's quite surprising that the coward and the black character survive so long  they're usually the first two to go.) <br/><br/>But although I dig Parker, I think Ian Holm as Ash delivers the best performance. It's quite subtle the way that he hints at his true identity  I like the way he jogs on the spot to get his joints working. And he's so smug and slimy. He's more of a villain than the Alien.<br/><br/>But I think everything in the film is fantastic  the music, the special effects, the sequence on the alien planet, the production design, the moody atmosphere, the script I just wish I had more room to waffle."
"OwenReallyCool","10","4","5","5 December 2019"," Perfect movie, gets better on every rewatch
","Alien is a movie that needs no introduction. It's revolutionary to the entertainment industry and still holds up really well all these years later. The plot is simple: a crew on a spaceship investigate a distress call that awoke them from hypersleep that leads them to a crashed spaceship and while searching the ship, a small creature attaches itself to one of the crew members and eventually gives birth to a huge monster that begins to take them out one by one and when all hope seems lost, the crew must find a way to stop this unknown and seemingly unstoppable threat.<br/><br/>Always having an admiration for Sci-Fi and horror movies, seeing them blend here flawlessly is like a dream come true. Being someone who has loved this movie since I pretty much saw for the first time, it's gotten better everytime I've watched it. The production design is flawless, this movie still has some of the coolest costumes and sets I've seen in a movie. Everything feels dirty, lived in, solid, gritty. It really adds to the overall tone and setting of the film and even though you barely see the alien, you still feel it's presence because of how good everything looks.<br/><br/>I also love how they establish where each of the crew members fit in with the ship like how one is the pilot and how another is the captain. One of the characters is revealed to be a robot and I love watching the movie knowing he's one because you can see clear moments where he's trying to find a way to get this creature back to Earth. Phenomenal storytelling. I also love the bit where Dallas tells Ripley to open the door and she's like ""I'm sorry, Dallas. I'm afraid I cannot do that"". Yes, there are a lot of inspirations with 2001: A Space Odyssey in the movie, especially at the beginning.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the actual Xenomorph itself, my favorite creature design in any movie ever. It has this very sexual feeling to it that makes it all the more unnerving and frightening. The music also creates a sense of tension that adds a lot to the movie, so good. Overall, Alien is one of my favorite movies of all time and if you love creepy and tense Sci-Fi flicks, check this one out."
"peter-3004","9","4","5","24 July 2019"," A light touch for a totally scary movie!!
","Great Sci-Fi film, featuring a lot more realism than any of the films I was raised on as a youngster in the early 1950s. As a nine-year old, I was impressed by _Rocketship XM_ but my dad, who *was* a rocket scientist, laughed throughout it and spoilt it for me. The _Nostromo_ in _Alien_ was a junker tractor rocket; it had *dents* for Christ's sake! So it was real. Most of the crew were derelicts as well, so the fit the ship and the plot. Not too bright, and more than a wee bit clumsy. The Alien was designed by a Swiss (Geiger) who knew his biology. In the insect world, *all* the wasps reproduce by laying eggs on or inside the body of a host, be it a spider or caterpillar. It is now believed there is a separate wasp species for every caterpillar species -- and that's a few! The extrudable alien mouthpiece is an exact copy of a dragonfly nymph's mouth -- he uses it to catch small fish. 'Nother thing about this alien: most early aliens might look scary, but they were dumb and slow. You had to be a total klutz/moron (or a pretty blond) to get caught. *This* alien is smart, very smart, . . . and FAST! Nothing like it before this film. Sigourney Weaver is a delight, Skerrit is a good captain, John Hurt makes a great first meal for Mr. Alien, and Harry Dean Stanton always contributes his own special charm. Then, there's ""Jonesy""!! True star quality!
Talk about pregnant suspense: all you can want and more. The music was ethereal and totally appropriate, great art direction and camera work. A classic, with a light touch to get the best scare out of one.
One other note: After seeing it (and having bad dreams), I needed to go back and see it again! It was even more scary the *second* time because I knew what was going to happen and couldn;t stop it! Talk about living a nightmare, and paying good money to do it! :-)"
"saymaraza","9","4","5","5 June 2016"," Alien review
","Alien is one of the first movies directed by legendary 'Ridley Scott' (Blade Runner, Gladiator) The film is a classic in the making. When i first heard about this movie i was around 10 years old, obviously too young to watch the movie, now i am 17 and i have watched it for the first time, now twice i enjoyed it so much. This is honestly one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the 70s, probably is my favourite Sci Fi movie of the 70s, and one of the best of all time. The Sequel 'Aliens' (1986) was directed by James Cameron, another one of my favourite directors. Director of 'The Terminator' (1984) which stands as my favourite Sci-Fi movie of all time. The reason i didn't want to see Alien when i was younger, was because i always felt scared of the Alien, i used to have horrific nightmares of them just thinking about them. When i went to Disney world, i have always loved Movies, so i decided to visit a Movie ride, the Alien suddenly popped out of the ceiling, of course it was only plastic, but looked real enough. So i had always been too scared to watch the Movie. I didn't know what i was missing out! As i watched it i didn't know what i was worrying about. It's very different to watching it on Screen than seeing for real. I am nearly 18 now, so i am not really scared of anything anymore, i would definitely go back to Disney and try out that ride again, just to see if it still scares me, I think now i've finally seen the movie i appreciate now that it's not real, and i find it interesting than scary now more than anything, because it feels like I'm in the movie. When it comes to Ridley Scott director 'Prometheus' (2012) a prequel to Alien, that wasn't very scary at all, it was more of a mystery than a Sci-Fi/ Horror i thought. Alien is deifinitely a classic in the making, Don't miss Ridley Scott's masterpiece Alien!"
"jbassindale-70444","9","4","5","15 May 2016"," A Horror Classic
","This movie predates my childhood, since I was born at a time when horror was sadly beginning to fade into the cliché standards of today's ""scary movies."" This is the sort of horror movie everyone remembers, and it has stood the test of time like no other movie in the genre (with the exception of, perhaps, Psycho or The Shining) ever has. The phrase 'in space nobody can hear you scream' has never been so effective, and the movie relies on atmosphere to generate this effectiveness. This is a risky decision for any movie developer, since if that atmosphere is not established well enough, then the movie looses all sense of fear and tension. Here, however, this is not the case. The alien is instantly established as a threat - ever since that infamously gory scene in the cafeteria; you all know which one I'm talking about - and this threat, combined with the tight hallways and sense of claustrophobia, is what shapes Alien into the terrifying, chilling movie that is renowned as even more than 25 years later."
"jazzest","6","11","19","31 January 2005"," Simplicity in Storytelling and Art Direction Makes the Film Timeless
","The very reason of the huge and continuing success of this 25-year-old sci-fi classic may be the simplicity in its storytelling and its art direction, which has seemingly made the film timeless and universal.<br/><br/>A simple And-Then-There-Were-None type of story has no era-related influence from the late 70s, while many sci-fi films tend to mirror the world at the time they are made. Staged mostly in a closed environment inside a spaceship and briefly on an unknown planet far from Earth, the film practically has no connection to any particular culture.<br/><br/>The designs of aliens' colony on the planet and of the alien by H. R. Giger must have been remarkably cutting-edge back in the time; for contemporary eyes, they look rather simply beautiful. The title design at the opening is also appropriately simple: Green LED-like lights turn on one by one to form the letters of ""ALIEN.""<br/><br/>The film doesn't look old at all after 25 years and probably will never do. This is one of great examples that simplicity attains eternity."
"freaky_dave","10","10","17","2 March 2006"," The beginning of a memorable series
","Alien was the first film that started it all. It gave us Aliens in 1986 and then two lesser sequels in the proceeding years. One can not review Aliens and not review Alien because both films go together so perfectly. Even though both films had their different styles, they both had Sigourney Weaver and one of the most fearsome creatures to ever grace the big screen. It's also my second most favorite horror movie of all time behind Jaws, a film I saw when I was just a wee lad.<br/><br/>The crew of the Nostromo, a large space freighter that looks immense and incredibly scary thanks to director Ridley Scott's camera work, is awaken early from hyper sleep to investigate what seems to be a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. After a rough landing on the desolate planet, three of the crew members go out to investigate and find a large spaceship. However this is not all they find. Soon one of the crew members, who gets a little too curious, finds himself in a coma-like state with something attached to his face. He is soon brought back to the Nostromo by his shipmates, where they go about analyzing him to see what has happened. But this crew of working men and women have no clue what grisly horrors soon await them because they are no longer alone. Something dark and dangerous with no remorse for humankind will soon be stalking them one by one, and there seems to be nothing on board that is able to stop it.<br/><br/>This movie was fantastic in every way. Ridley Scott uses mood and shadows as well as size to make the Nostromo look like the biggest, scariest haunted house ever. He also uses fabulous camera work to get his points across as well.<br/><br/>The suspense in this movie builds and builds, and the creature is kept mostly in the shadows until when it attacks. And it attacks with a lethal efficiency. It is never seen for long periods of time, and this works perfectly. Like Spielberg with Jaws, Scott realizes that what is unseen is always more terrifying. One of the most effective murder scenes in this film is unseen, but we clearly hear the horrifying screams and panting of the victim and know that something horrible is happening.<br/><br/>I can go on in on about this movie. I can talk about the music score which adds more dread to this film, and I can talk about the acting which was superb, but it would take up way too much space. I can also go on about the Oscar worthy special effects which are probably the best ever for 1979, but I won't. Lets just say this. If you like horror movies that build suspense and are not filled with senseless gore that looks unrealistic, then you are in for a treat. By the way this film does have some bloody scenes. One of the best involves sitting around a dinner table while everybody is eating. Yuk.<br/><br/>Many people always compare Alien and Aliens. Some like Aliens the most and some like Alien the most. Both are classic sci-fi horror films by two different directors, and both get my highest marks, but if I had to chose, Alien would be my first choice, followed closely by Aliens."
"Rich359","6","5","7","26 February 2017"," Doesn't quite hold up after all these years.
","After viewing the film again after 37 years, and loving it when I first saw it, I realize that it has many flaws. Most noticeable are: 1) the horribly developed dialogue between crew members. Obviously the writers never worked in a factory like setting, or for that matter, any setting where they had to communicate with small talk with co-workers. Compare this dialogue with the dialogue from the 1951 Thing or even Forbidden Planet.<br/><br/>2) Sigourney Weavers character is way too harsh. It may have been a sign of the times to create a ""strong woman"" but in the film she comes off needlessly harsh and unappealing. <br/><br/>3) Overuse of technical effects like the strobe light. Why does a ship have strobe lights anyway?<br/><br/>4) A very big rip-off of the film ""It, the terror from beyond space. The plot line and dialogue was better in that one as well."
"PredragReviews","9","5","7","20 April 2016"," Sci-Fi/Horror Masterpiece!
","""Alien"" is one of the most intense Sci-Fi thrillers to have ever graced the silver screen or the home theater in any format! It is the film's intensity that provides such an incredible draw to this extraordinary film. I was pulled in by the ultra high sense of realism. This film almost feels like a documentary because of a lot of the subtle hand-held camera work (read; not like the shaky, seizure inducing hand-held work of today's films). There's much going on in that film that was revolutionary for the time. Great ideas, design, cinematography, subtle, very realistic performances.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver stars as Ellen Ripley in her film debut role. Weaver is absolutely perfect for the role, and was practically the first girl-power type female heroine who single-handedly carries this international blockbuster right through until the final minutes. John Hurt also plays Kane to excellent effect, especially in his death scene as he frantically wriggles on the table with the alien inside him. Harry Dean Stanton is brilliant as Brett, as is Tom Skerritt as Dallas. Yaphet Kotto is also perfectly cast as Parker, who provides many on-screen laughs. Veronica Kartwright (who later went on to star in The X-Files some 20 years later) stars as the lovable Lambert, the only other female member of the crew along with Ripley. Ian Holm as Ash is absolutely brilliant in his role as the android secretly sent on board to bring back the alien life- form, while - in his eyes, and ""Mother's"" - all other crew members are expendable. The acting in this film is really first-rate, which is another big factor in why the film works so well.<br/><br/>The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself is right on the money. It amazes me how well visually this movie still holds up. It feels as rich and deep cinematically as most anything today due to Ridley Scott's brilliant visuals. You watch this film at certain points and it feels as slick and polished as any current genre film without the hollowness or incompetence. <br/><br/>All in all, Alien is a terrific sci-fi horror movie that plays with your senses incredibly well. Nothing happens for the first 30 minutes, and that is exactly the director's intent. By doing so, a feeling of extreme suspense is instantly formed, leaving you on the edge of your seat until the very end.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."

","I'm kind of at a loss for words. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed. I thought the film was one of the most excruciatingly dull I've ever seen. It just dragged on and on, with even the violent scenes were the alien attacks being completely uninteresting because you see nothing that happens. It's just some blurs, some terrible acting, a closeup of the mouth and it's over. The characters were total clichés and completely uninteresting ones at that. I didn't care once about what was going to happen to them. I was just praying they all died and the film ended an hour before it was supposed to. The film wasn't remotely suspenseful or engaging. A lot of scenes were unintentionally laughable because of how absurd they were (like the one in the picture above) or because of how contrived and idiotic they were (like Ash being a robot). As much as I want to give this film a below average rating though, there's no denying that it's technical aspects are phenomenal. The art direction and makeup completely revolutionized science-fiction and the cinematography is ingenious. But when all is said and done I was just bored to tears and extremely disappointed."

","Usually I don't care for films that have nothing but unlikable characters and a lot of verbal blasphemy, but this was so well done that I just had to have this on a good DVD because I'll always watch this film every few years. It's just too interesting to ignore.<br/><br/>The attractions are the incredible suspense; excellent photography and set design and memorable horror scenes. They didn't overdo the action scenes, either, as is so often the case with modern-day films. In fact, some of this might be too slow-moving for today's audience.<br/><br/>The suspense, as crew members search for the killer alien, is almost unbearable at times and helps make up for the profane cast, all of whom are low-life people who would never be astronauts in real life. I personally applauded when Veronica Cartwright, who had one of the nastiest faces and mouths on screen, met her demise. The rest of the crew wasn't much classier. Since this movie came out, in fact, the sequels to this plus many other science fiction films seem to portray astronauts as trashy people which is the opposite of reality and just plain ludicrous.<br/><br/>Anyway, Alien a memorable movie to anyone who has seen it. Who can ever forget the alien emerging from John Hurt's chest? That's a scene that stays with you forever. Others have tried to imitate the horror of that scene, but never quite been as successful.<br/><br/>The restored DVD gives this 25-year-old film a new appearance. It looks fabulous and really highlights the great cinematography and superb direction by Ridley Scott. This is just great entertainment if you want to spend a night on the edge of your seat."
"chaos-rampant","Null","6","9","14 September 2012"," The machinery of chaos (Montezuma's Revenge)
","This one really needs no introduction, this pitch black vision of an unfathomable darkness. If I was asked to run a film class, this would be a prime example to study: collaboration, reinvention, conceptual design that accommodates damage to it, the journey of shared vision from page to space. It does everything right that could easily have gone wrong. The backbone is an extremely coherent space world and mythology, as complicated as we find in Star Wars but with only necessary snippets provided instead of platitudes. On top of that, you have (expertly executed) the age old story of an encounter with ancient evil. But this one has biology, structure that horrifies more. The icing on the cake is a final layer about the nature of the encounter, your encounter with 'alien' vision. Hold this thought.<br/><br/>It is amazing to revisit this in retrospect of how much it changed and how much has changed since.<br/><br/>In the 1970's, one of the hottest and most troubled film properties for a while was Dune. The scope and detail of Herbert's books called for a a film on a massive scale, a blockbuster, and that was a time when the blockbuster was still a fluid concept. It was a time when you could dream the unthinkable: a 10-hour Jodorowsky extravaganza with the creative involvement of Dali, Welles, Gloria Swanson, Delon, Jagger, designed by H.R. Giger and scored by Pink Floyd. Extensive pre-production work was axed when money decided the venture was impractical, and basically nuts. The world safely went with the Spielberg-Lucas model, nurtured from Jaws to Star Wars. The prevalent business model for a Hollywood blockbuster these days, is a bankable producer-director in charge (he can be a little creative), and contract out the design and effects-work to individual SFX studios. We're getting poorer every year and the products more bland, because of this IKEA mentality.<br/><br/>Anyway, the smoke from the colossal Dune collapse turbulently shifted in two directions. We got the two Phillip K. Dick adaptations in the 80's, one of them Scott's Bladerunner. The other is right here. Inbetween, Scott had been next in line after Jodorowsky to tackle and swiftly abandon Dune.<br/><br/>What happened, is that a guy called Dan O'Bannon (effects-man in that first Dune) drifted to screen writing to pull himself up from a financial hole. Out of many stories he penned, one was about an alien passenger wreaking havoc mid-space. In its first incarnation, it was going to be a Corman foamcore cheapie called Starbeast. Hollywood tapped the project, considering workingman Aldrich to direct. Daft choice, thankfully axed. This one needed new, excited blood like O'Bannon.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott came onboard, fresh and eager from a Kubrick-influenced debut. Kubrick's 2001-notions of cinematic space as a clean and silent roar, elegant design, and controlled visual eddies from symphonic flows of the camera, all of that was carried over into this, and is openly acknowledged in the first shot. O'Bannon(a horror guy) introduced Scott to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and more pieces from the Dune jigsaw: Foss and Moebius were carried over to sketch the world of the film. H.R. Giger was flown in from Switzerland, with alien-designs so disturbing he was held over at LAX.<br/><br/>And that is how it came together. The story was recycled from spare parts (Forbidden Planet, Planet of the Vampires), dressed in 'used' scrapyard aesthetic and Giger's diseased-looking biology, and finally given Texas Chainsaw- violence in the engine gears and fabric. And the nature of that collaborative encounter with the product of vision is sketched in the actual film, in the way it made a difference.<br/><br/>You have a colorful bunch of professionals in the same 'ship', each one a specialist in his field. Each one has his own logic about what the voyage is all about, but not necessarily equal say. They are earthbound before a beacon signals from the void.<br/><br/>It isn't until later that we find out a narrative of discovery had been set in motion around them, and that narrative is controlled by non-human agents, actual devices (Mother - Ash), which is why it's both simple and precise. The actual author won't be seen until Prometheus, one of many things mucked-up there.<br/><br/>The discovery is of something that we go on to understand has structure and design, and the instinct to do as designed challenges human conscience. And this is why Scott's presentation matters: it is not a guy in a suit we see, it is abstract shape, pure organism morphing before our eyes.<br/><br/>The second expansion is that it is not the story of explanations that matters, but the journey to retrieve new vision. This has been obscured, because that vision is a monster, and because on both ends of that story (Weyland - Engineerworld), you have only vague bits of clearly engineered worlds that we want to know more about (hence, the heavy Alien fanfiction that distracts by too much clarification).<br/><br/>It's all here though. The story was something to get you to where the void signals.<br/><br/>The real deal is in how we come to terms with something that is new and seemingly dragged strange and whole from the void.<br/><br/>And it takes a dissonant - human - element to muck up the precise Weyland gears of the narrative, and actually give birth to the thing. A machine would never be curious enough to touch the egg.<br/><br/>This is brilliant. It's all in the coordinated bursts of machine-reason to human-chaos to inscrutable creature-reason and back again, and the way that is choreographed into an environment that bleeds and bursts into our vision (best seen in the discovery of the alien ship). <br/><br/>Our vision itself is the alien being born, space impregnated and convulsing with the process."

I will say that there is a great Twist plot involved and let's just say it's makes for a Great movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed ""Alien,"" the various twist plots and the way it presents in this sci-fi/Action movie. It is one of the better/great Sci-fi movies I have watched so far and would definitely watch it again to get any detail that I didn't from the first screening of it. I am a hardcore sci-fi dude (Sci-fi/Fantasy) and if you are into Sci-fi as well I'd highly recommend this movie if you haven't seen it already it is really the golden standard for Any kind of Alien movie in my book."

","Believe it or not, I had never seen an Alien film. What prompted me to actually see it was the fantastic Prometheus trailer that debuted. Even if the film turns out to suck (which I really doubt) it would still have been worth it to watch the original Alien.<br/><br/>What can I say? Fantastic. The music, the slow-paced nature of the first half, together with increasing tension as the film goes along is incredible. Once stuff hits the fan, it never lets you go. The film is also quite scary, an it made me jump various times. Why? It knows how to build tension incredibly, and the final 20 minutes are truly perfection. Both the sound and visual effects work to make the film a very effective experience, as does the wonderful cinematography. Bring on the Aliens, bitch!"

","The important thing to have in mind when watching this movie is paying attention to the movie itself, story, atomosphere and horror, much more than the acting, music and dialogues. Not to omit, this is 1979, a great deal of work has put into this movie.
Remarkable scene decor and fantastic designs of the ship, rooms, vessels, equipment and the planet(!). I loved everything about this movie regarding the set. Panavision, indeed, has done a great job providing the crew with space to be creative, and what an incredible job by the crew!
Well-desereved award winning movie, transfers us into a commercial spaceship and then will let us alone in the dark space, experimenting with our survival instincts.
8 years later oscar nominee Sigourney Weaver, who played the leading actress, to me was rigid, forced and a bit artificial in her role. Her character, however, is particularily a favorite of mine, following rules and taking control when necessary, judging others and a deep suspicion that is just fit for her. Adequetly brave, as in not adventurous enough to take unnecessary risks, but brave enough to push her limits. While I get the shuttle scene where she's in her revealing top and the smallest panties they could find for her, indicating a finally-achieved moment of redemption, I don't get the necessity for the small panty! Is that really comfortable?<br/><br/>Let's talk about ash, everything about Ash is disturbing from the beginning, to the point that there are naked pictures and magazines on his desk. Does anyone understand why he tried to put the magzine in her mouth? Even as what he was, he should have been more efficient with his killing/smothering methods.<br/><br/>To movie, this movie is great in production, not so great in other aspects. 7/10."
"alexx668","6","17","34","17 June 2008"," The alien within?
","Despite it's legendary status, the truth is that Alien is just a horror movie set out in space, i.e. the alien monster taking the part of the serial killer that's murdering the cast one by one (minus of course the main character, in this case Ripley - played by Sigourney Weaver). So, nothing original, apart from that it's set in outer space.<br/><br/>Then where does that leave us? Well, two things are really of note. H.R. Giger's design of the alien planet and the creature itself - chilling and nightmarish, in what is the brush of a true artist, and also Ash's poetic reflection on the alien monster: ""Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility."" ""I admire its purity. A survivor.. unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.""<br/><br/>And yet despite the atmospheric approach, it's unclear what angle or view, if any, the film offers. Seemingly it condemns the instinctive effort for survival of the alien creature, yet in the end it's the morally bound humankind which prevails. In fact, the scene in the end where Ripley comes face to face with the alien and kills it by shooting it in outer space is probably the film's center of gravity. The alien creature is for the first time looking insecure and scared of dying, but Ripley (guided by her own instincts) shows no remorse. Here, the roles of the hunter and the hunted are blurred, and so is the moral status of mankind.<br/><br/>Other minor themes are the remorseless capitalist stance of the mother/company, which also hides a metaphysical meaning (the company is called mother, it controls the destiny of the crew, has it's own purposes, has it's chosen representative amongst the crew with the robot Ash etc)."
"kareda","7","14","27","18 February 2018"," A landmark in sci-fi, however some big issues with plot lacking realism
","First of all, for a sci-fi movie made in the end of 70s - and it doesn't look and feel silly for the most part - it deserves a high rating just for that. 
We can only imagine how innovative this looked almost 40 years ago. <br/><br/>Great flick overall, I only have some issues with the plot which takes away from the experience - it's just too damn unrealistic. By the logic of this plot, the human race has to be the dumbest space-faring species ever, just too stupid to survive. <br/><br/>Heavy spoilers: 
Stumble upon an unknown weird sounding signal in deep space, which noone understands. Witout analyzing it, assume it's a distress signal and go to investigate this with an unarmed cargo ship with a crew of 7. Perhaps just to observe a bit closer? Yeah OK makes sense so far. <br/><br/>Find out the signal is coming from an unknown planet in an unknown solar system, and immediately decide to land on that planet without further observation or even consulting Earth command or anything. OK, getting sketchy... <br/><br/>After landing and partly wrecking the ship immediately go outside in an alien world you know almost nothing about - without any idea who or what you'll be up against. Find an alien structure undoubtedly created by an intelligent lifeform, and immediately climb into it. So yeah then find a huge alien corpse who by the looks of it died a violent death, all the time touching everything. <br/><br/>Then go climbing into some dark caves - sure why not! Then find a field of huge eggs and go stuble around them and of course go touching these also - might as well... if you already did all the above! 
In the meantime back on the ship the crew learns that the signal looks like a warning. And although they have live video feed from the team outside, they can't or won't warn the team about this crucial information. <br/><br/>And so on and so on... Ripley is the only one with a sense of reason and she does warn everyone along the way... however it's just not enough for all this to make any sense - her very reasonable warnings should already be in the protocol in such cases. Umm.. like shouldn't the safety of the crew and ship be prio 1 etc? <br/><br/>The lack of realism also extends to acting here and there - after 2 crew members horribly killed, the captain is still calm as a coma like it's an everyday thing his crew members get butchered by deadly aliens on his cargo ship. He's talking up his plan like he's ordering a damn pizza - without any signs of stress or worry whatsoever. <br/><br/>Sure it's sci-fi and about the unknown, but in order to have a better impact an be more submersive as a movie, the plot should still makse sense in the areas that ARE known - like human behaviour and probable space-faring protocols that should follow some common sense. <br/><br/>The same events and suspense could have been backed up by better screenwriting - like they would have followed protocols which made sense in the first place - but some things went wrong etc. And the immersion and suspense would have been better because of increased realism. <br/><br/>So 7/10 for lack of realism, for an otherwise great ride into the unknown."
"emms75","10","9","16","11 April 2004"," Masterpiece
","Alien is a chilling suspense thriller set in space. Directed in 1978 by Ridley Scott, this film is important to me, as I admire the techniques used in order to generate a response in the viewer.<br/><br/>Back in 1978, the director couldn't rely upon today's modern digital effects to grab the audience's attention. Instead, he relies upon techniques such as camera angles, a clever set design, and a superb soundtrack to slowly build tension and create feelings of fear, vulnerability and intimidation within the audience.<br/><br/>It is at least half an hour into the film before the audience are aware of the extent of the horrors that follow. Until then, the uncertainty of not knowing exactly what we should be afraid of only adds to the tension. The eventual release of the tension, which has gradually built up, inevitably has more impact.<br/><br/>The film is set in a time and place unknown to us. However there are several ideas in the film which we can recognise and relate to, making the story believable, therefore more frightening.<br/><br/>For example, the idea of travelling far in space for the purposes of a mining expedition is something which the viewer could accept as likely to be happening in the future. Also, the seven characters on board the ship have an obvious class system, something which we can all relate to in any work environment.<br/><br/>These are some of the qualities which make Alien so popular, making it an inspiring piece of film making."

","Alien is directed Ridley Scott and stars Sigourney Weaver in her breakout role as Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut that belongs to a crew that receives a distress call from an unexplored planet while in space. They respond to the call by landing on the planet, and searching it. They seemingly find nothing, but, upon leaving, find an unwanted visitor aboard their ship. Once they figure out that this ""alien"" is superior to humans in most every way, the film becomes a battle to either kill, or at most escape, the deadly creature.<br/><br/>This film is widely considered one of the best horror movies of all time, and I can really see why. I can also see why some consider it one of the best films of all time. Alien is teeming with suspense, and keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat for almost the entire run time, say for some exposition in the beginning. Every time the audience gets even a subtle glimpse of the beast, each and every time there's a subtle jump, singularly due to the amazing practical effects of the alien itself.<br/><br/>To start with some pros, the directing is utterly fantastic, to say the least. Ridley Scott does such a good job working the camera; it makes every emotion pop right out of the screen and suck the watcher right into the movie, drawing out the tone drastically. Some of the long takes can pull forth the tension throughout the scene, or the fear that a specific character feels at the present time.<br/><br/>The acting is also amazing, starting with Sigourney Weaver. She gives one of the most breathtaking female performances in cinema history. Her character, Ellen Ripley, is a very strong and independent female; one in which no male is required to make her who she is, unlike most female leads today. If movies delivered more characters like Ripley, films would be better in almost every way.<br/><br/>The hands down best thing about this film, however, is the simplicity of the plot. One can only imagine a person pitching the idea for this film, saying ""a crew of astronauts are stuck on a ship with an alien that kills them."" The straightforwardness of the plot is so astounding, it makes one do a double take upon the complexity of a horror, or even action, film in the modern day. This simplicity is present in many ""best films of all time,"" such as Die Hard (1988), or Jaws (1975). Overcomplicated plots are one of the many reasons why too many movie goers say ""they don't make'em like they used to.""<br/><br/>Overall, Alien is understandably one of the best films of all time, thanks to the characters, directing, and clarity of the plot. I'm going to give Alien an A+, or a 10 out of 10."

","What can be said that hasn't already been said, nothing that's what. One of the best in the genre to be made and best effects for it's time. They simply don't make films like this anymore Hollywood won't risk it or this generation won't appreciate it. One of the great strengths of ""Alien"" is its pacing. It takes its time. It waits. It allows silences.Today's slasher movies, in the sci-fi genre and elsewhere, are all pay-off and no buildup.The result is a film that absorbs us in a mission before it involves us in an adventure, and that consistently engages the alien with curiosity and logic, instead of simply firing at it.We have now descended into a bog of Gotcha! movies in which various horrible beings spring on a series of victims, usually teenagers. The ultimate extension of the genre is the Geek Movie, illustrated by the remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" which essentially sets the audience the same test as an old-time carnival geek show: Now that you've paid your money, can you keep your eyes open while we disgust you? A few more ambitious and serious sci-fi films have also followed in the footsteps of ""Alien,"" notably the well-made ""Aliens"" (1986) and ""Dark City"" (1998). But the original still vibrates with a dark and frightening intensity."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Alien"" (1979) is a masterpiece, pure and simple. If there is still anyone who somehow haven't seen it (i can't imagine how could that be even possible), do your self a favor a watch it, not with your friends on Friday evening, but alone and let this movie blow you away. <br/><br/>I saw this picture for 5-7 times in my life, and the last time i did (actualy today), was on my 2m x 2m screen projector with all sound system ready to roll. <br/><br/>This is timeless film because of many things. The atmosphere, the rising tension, the craftsmanship of the scenes, acting - it all works here because they are not overplayed, and build on seemingly simple approach. 15 minutes into this movie again i caught myself that i forgot everything and i was in there, with them. Thats because of the script, directing, acting - it's all in the first place here, not settings, which still looks great - a bit dated, maybe, but it's not Star Wars type movie were visuals have to be sharp - ""Alien"" shows things in shadows, moody style to create feeling of uncertainty, and it does it brilliantly - that is why this movie is never going to age. <br/><br/>Please don't ever compare it to even superior (in my opinion) ""Aliens"" - ""Alien"" is different kind of a movie, it's purpose was to scare people with deadly and very claustrophobic atmosphere, settings and the creature itself, to feel people uncomfortable (in a good way) knowing that no one is safe here and around every corner there could be your end - just look at the close ups near the end of the movie, or shoots where camera is showing person and a deep dark space behind him, thats were imagination starts to fill the darkness.<br/><br/>Overall, 10/10 for one of the greatest achievements in the art of movie making."
"mstomaso","10","6","10","8 June 2007"," Innovative Sci-Fi Thriller Reintroduces Realism to the Genre
","While there is a general resemblance to the classic pulp sci fi film, ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"", Alien is an expertly crafted and thoroughly original film. In my opinion, it is also vastly superior to all of its descendants, including James Cameron's action and special effects smorgasbord, Aliens.<br/><br/>As a teenager, I was so intrigued by the premise of this movie that I was one of the few people in the United States who went out and purchased Alan Dean Foster's book ""Alien"" and read it before the film was released. The book was actually very good, so I knew I was either in for a big treat or a total disappointment when I went to see Ridley Scott's Alien on opening night. Of course, there was no disappointment.<br/><br/>Scott assembled a great cast, none of whom (at the time) had a great deal of face recognition except, perhaps, Ian Holm. He placed his characters in stasis aboard a long distance freight ship (""the Nostromo"") owned and operated by a mining company. The ship is grimy, a little broken down, and a bit cramped. The habitat module is one very small portion of this enormous commercial barge.<br/><br/>The film uses sound beautifully. Both the amazingly haunting and memorable postmodern soundtrack and excellent soundscape are flawless. The film opens with the ship's computer beginning to power on the ship's systems, and even though the scene consists of nothing but sound effects and mostly immobile hardware, it is permanently burned into my memory.<br/><br/>The crew is awakened, and unlike most sci fi films, almost immediately begins complaining about being brought out of stasis early and bickering about how much they should be paid for what appears to be an extra duty. Soon, we learn that a communication signal has been picked up on a planet nearby and the Nostromo's shuttle must descend to the planet and investigate.<br/><br/>All of this is established effortlessly by Scott's fantastic directing, cinematography and editing, but rather than spoiling any aspect of this brilliantly plotted and presented story, I will discontinue my plot summary here and move on to the critique.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott has directed two of the best science fiction films of all time - Bladerunner and Alien. These two films are completely different and also radically innovative for the sci fi genre. Alien reintroduces realism the the genre. The crew is not a bunch of heroic freedom fighters or righteous warriors. Instead, they are corporate staff members and a couple of administrators - a captain (Skerrit) and first officer (Weaver) who are the company management representatives, mechanics, a science officer/ship's surgeon, a navigator, and geologists (it's a mining company). The ship itself is not a sterile faster-than-light Maserati in space, but a gritty, messy, cramped, barge. And the alien is TRULY ALIEN. 'nuff said about him.<br/><br/>H.R. Giger's organic/cybernetic art enhances the other-worldliness of all of the scenes that take place off of the Nostromo, and of course, the design of the alien itself. An enormous contribution that should not be overlooked.<br/><br/>It doesn't really matter which version of this film you see. They are all terrific. The director's cut adds a couple of scenes which appeared in the book, but were left out of the original release. Personally, I don't think these scenes really add much to the film, but it is a matter of personal taste, since all of the versions I have seen are 10s.<br/><br/>Recommended for anybody who can tolerate sci-fi."
"tsf-1962","10","6","10","19 November 2006"," Halloween in space
","In many ways, the first ""Alien"" can be described as the sordid underbelly of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Instead of pristine white interiors and clean-cut young men in shorts we have the cramped interior of a grimy, smelly cargo ship with a surly and contentious crew. This is as far from the perfect world of ""Star Trek"" as you can get. The men are unshaven, and everyone smokes, drinks, and uses bad language. Tom Skerritt as the captain does little to inspire confidence, and the only person who knows what she's doing is Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who ironically becomes the only survivor, launching Sigourney Weaver's career as a star and becoming the first female action hero in film history (unless one counts Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz."") It's interesting how the imagery of this film influenced later science fiction, particularly the series ""Red Dwarf."" In terms of plots, ""Alien"" follows the general outline of the classic slasher film ""Halloween,"" with Ripley in the Jamie Lee Curtis role. The alien creature is still probably the most repulsive monster in movie history; unlike ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or ""E.T. The Extraterrestrial,"" this is a first encounter that is anything but joyous."

","Commercial star ship Nostromo, returning from a routine mission, are detoured when an alien SOS is intercepted. Awakened from hypersleep, the crew are obligated to land on the alien world where the call for help has originated, but the ship is slightly damaged during the landing process and three of the crew set out to explore the hostile new world. They come upon a derelict spacecraft, the skeletonized remains of an alien creature with an odd wound in its chest and a cache of strange egg-like objects. Crew member Kane is brought back from the exploration unconscious and with a bizarre, crab-like creature attached to his face. He is still alive, and indeed, the creature on his face seems to be keeping him alive for reasons unknown. The Nostromo is repaired and the crew leave the desolate planet behind. The crab creature soon leaves its perch on Kane's face and dies, and Kane emerges from his coma, apparently in good health. But the purpose of the alien soon becomes terribly clear; Kane has been impregnated with an alien embryo which births itself from his chest in a shower of blood and gore, killing Kane and escaping into the ships air ducts before anyone can react. The crew set out to destroy the creature, not realizing immediately that its accelerated growth has transformed it into a huge and vicious predator whose only desire is to kill them all.<br/><br/>Very loosely based upon the 1958 horror film ""IT! The Terror From Beyond Space"" Alien is a masterpiece of Gothic horror, a haunted house movie on a spaceship. Flawlessly directed by Ridley Scott, Alien, whose plot is actually fairly simplistic and nothing new, is so filled with dread, so claustrophobically genuine, that it seems like nothing ever seen before. Ghostly steam, clinking chains, long dark corridors where anything can be hiding, the suspense is unbelievably suffocating. We never really get to see what the alien actually looks like until films end, and so the quick flashes of tail, head and mouth are so brief and so confusing that it only adds to the horror. Plus, Alien does what no ghost story can do - there is no way out of this ""haunted house."" There is no escape from the horror within.<br/><br/>The performances are all outstanding. The alien is not the only menace to the all-too human crew; there are also soulless corporations and short circuiting androids to be dealt with on top of everything else. Faced with these dilemmas, every single crew member of the Nostromo are absolutely believable. They're tired, stressed out, rude and bitchy and they spend a good lot of time griping and snapping at each other, but they drop what they're doing and stand together, protecting one another without hesitation when they must. The gore is minimal; the death of Kane is the bloodiest, nastiest moment in the whole film and because Kane, played by John Hurt, seems to be the nicest of the crew members, it just makes his painful death scene all the more horrible.<br/><br/>Alien is a grim, visceral, satisfying horror film and remains the unsurpassed best film in the series. Alien is an established classic and should not be missed."

","In terms of sci-fi horror, Ridley Scott's »Alien« is as good as it gets. As many people have pointed out, the story is basically B-movie stuff: a spooky monster haunts some hapless people, only this time they're in space. Scott stages the rather simple plot like an arthouse flick, beginning with the slick and lifeless introduction to the space ship Nostromo. The atmosphere is unbelievably tense throughout the movie: from the industrial Nostromo, the stormy planet V-426 to the phallic Alien designed by H. R. Giger. <br/><br/>In many ways, »Alien« is the antithesis to Stanley Kubrick's »2001: A Space Odyssey«, the most megalomaniac movie ever conceived. Ridley Scott shows us that space travel won't be about philosophical self-discovery. It will be about dirty, senseless work. Of course, there are also some gender issues at stake here. Sigourney Weaever as Ellen Ripley might be most badass last girl in movie history - and maybe the first female action star that is not reduced to her womanhood. <br/><br/>If »Alien« has one problem, it's the fact that it betrays its B-movie roots. There is a wannabe-deep scene near the end of the movie that feels affixed, as if Ridley Scott wanted to reconcile the intellectuals in the movie theater. That wasn't necessary at all. Still, if you're into stylish and evocative sci-fi, horror or sci-fi horror, you need to watch »Alien«. Man, what am I talking about? If you're into movies at all, you need to watch this flick."

","Alien has a slow and mysterious beginning. It starts like nothing special - some people eating and talking on a space ship. But it gets more intense when they detect an unknown planet and land on it so they can explore it. The audience has to wait more than 1 hour to see the thing they paid for - the xenomorph. And this waiting makes its emergence one of the greatest moments in the cinematic history. Still we see the xenomorph only 3 or 4 times which is quite disappointing but this makes the alien more mysterious and gives the movie a horror character. And of course another reason we see the xenomorph so rarely is because the CGI wasn't very well developed at that time and it was pretty hard to make the alien's appearance. Alien(1979) is a great start for the Alien anthology and even though the bad CGI it's the best movie in the whole anthology. The movie is worth watching."

There are a handful of movies that I consider genuinely scary (movies that give you at least one or two sleepless nights, like The Exorcist or David Lynch's surrealistic nightmare, Eraserhead) and Alien is the best of them all.<br/><br/>I have seen Alien countless times and it never ceases to amaze me. None of its sequels or prequels managed to reach such a level of perfection (although I liked them all with the exception of Alien3). The production design (especially H.R. Giger's creations) and the visual effects do not feel dated at all even after all these years. The eerie music and sound effects still make your hair stand on end. The sequence inside the interiors of the derelict ship, the eggs, the facehugger, the 'birth scene' – all iconic moments that are just as shocking today as they were in 1979. The cast are all impeccable, but the multi-faceted Ian Holm (Napoleon & Love, Brazil, Lord of the Rings) and Sigourney Weaver deliver especially mesmerising performances.

","Simply put this is horror perfection. The detail in the film is down to a tee. From the score all the way down to the acting. The set was deliberately made to be as claustrophobic as possible by Scott and it plays a vital role in the whole tone of the finished film. The acting is perfect in terms of the necessary tension needed for the film and the cast is star studded for the day (albeit Sigourney Weaver was a relative unknown at the time). The beast itself is the ultimate in horror terror and nothing will ever be scarier on screen, especially seeing as though it's all computer generated nowadays, and the fact that you don't see a lot of the beast adds to the tension and fear. The pacing is a bit slow to start with but rips into the action when the face hugger makes it's debut appearance. The tagline is 100% the best tagline in the history of film, and goes extremely well with the setting of space. It's got to be said that horror doesn't get any better than this.

I can see how this movie would have impressed a lot of people who first viewed it when it came out. But watching a movie that came out when I wasn't even born, it just fell short of my expectation. This film is far from being a bad movie, it was actually good but I just felt that it was a bit overrated. The title of the movie is ""Alien"", but the audience don't even get to see the alien all that much, well besides that there is little to no tension and most of the scenes are just a group of truckers in space that decides to go investigating in till they come across a unpleasant discovery and investigate some more, but none of it was intense or gripping. Although there are very few scenes of the actual alien, I get the feeling that they went that direction to add more fright, but didn't really work for me. A lot of the scenes were about the crew trying to find out what the alien is capable of. The movie also goes in a direction where you just don't care for the crew that is trying to survive. It was probably a phenomenal movie of it's time and did a lot for the sci-fi horror genre, but I ain't going to jump on the bandwagon and say this movie is the best in the genre.<br/><br/>7.2/10"

","This isn't just an 'alien' film this is the alien film. A film that succeeds in both the horror and Sci-fi genre. Having seen both versions of this film directors and the theatrical, I must tell you to watch this film. The acting cast is great, the story flows and is logical but that's not even the best part. The special effects and CGI have never really been topped by any other film. Even in the newer 'alien' movies or the 'alien vs predator' franshise. Nothing has created true horror in the 'alien' universe such as this. A classic most people would call it, after all it is the alien movie."

"hitchcockthelegend","10","3","4","12 May 2019"," There is a clause in the contract which specifically states any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin must be investigated...
","Alien is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon. It stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.<br/><br/>The space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...<br/><br/>Back on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.<br/><br/>On plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.<br/><br/>Some still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid conventions.<br/><br/>With art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.<br/><br/>It made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.<br/><br/>Now 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly so. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10"

"Christopher_Reid","9","3","4","21 January 2018"," Great sci-fi horror
","Alien is one of the best sci-fi movies of all time and it also happens to be a horror, making it all the more tense and exciting to watch. Its strength is its patience combined with top-notch visuals and music and an original plot.<br/><br/>The look of the movie is incredible from start to finish. The Nostromo spaceship, the interiors, the Alien itself. Much of it was designed by H.R. Giger, a German with a unique and fascinating style. He also worked on Jodorowsky's Dune (which never got made) and you can see similarities in the design. They seem to combine the organic with the artificial and often border on the sexual. The inside of an alien spaceship is full of imaginative and strange details like nothing you've seen before. It's a shame Prometheus was such a terrible attempt at expanding on the story behind it...<br/><br/>The score by the prolific Jerry Goldsmith is one of his best. There are faint echoes of more innocent sounding woodwinds with swelling, ominous strings in the background. It's mysterious but captures mankind's natural sense of wonder - it's not completely evil. As one character says at one point, they practically admire the alien, despite its capacity for destruction. We can't help but feel similarly. There's a juxtaposition of beauty and death. In Interstellar as well, the characters go on journeys at the edge of what's possible, seeing incredible things but also facing the serious risk of death. Our universe (and the beings in it) can be a harsh but beautiful mistress.<br/><br/>Like all the great horror movies, the monster or threat is only gradually revealed. We're in the dark along with the characters. The details surrounding the alien, how it reproduces, what defence mechanisms it has, what on Earth it even is are very cool. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is a strong female character who is forced into a survival situation. She's one of the few to use common sense throughout the whole movie. She's cautious where others aren't. She know why certain rules are in place and gets frustrated that others would prefer to take risks. As it turns out, she was right the whole time.<br/><br/>There are slow shots moving down corridors, letting us take in the designs of the walls, sometimes with emergency rotating lights and gas clouding things a bit. The movie takes its time setting things up and creating a mood. When things do happen, they have more impact because of the calm moments in between. But I enjoy the quiet moments just as much. There's always plenty to take in and ponder.<br/><br/>There are many twists and turns in the plot. This keeps things tense - we don't know what might come out of nowhere, who can be trusted, where are you safe. There are some frustrating horror cliché moments where it seems like problems could have been prevented if the people were less stupid at key moments. But we also get to experience some imaginative situations which aren't yet possible with current technology but might well become realities in the near future.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I don't find the alien itself scary. But I like its presence and the overall mood of the movie - it's a very well made horror. It's more about suspense than jump scares. It builds up the anticipation and a sense of inescapability. The tone is a bit depressing in some ways. These humans are in the middle of nowhere. But we do get the impression they're heading back to Earth and usually spend their journeys in some kind of cryo-sleep. This movie's an exception to their routine. But a film like Jaws is much easier to relate to while still putting the humans in a setting (the sea) where they're out of their comfort zone.<br/><br/>Aliens is a great sequel but the rest are more average. Alien goes down as the best of its genre, a horror sci-fi that takes its time, confident in its story and visuals and creates one of the most memorable movie monsters of all time with characters we care about."

","At the end of the day, Alien is now roughly almost 40 years old. 40 years is a long time, and we've seen cinema evolve drastically over that period, yet Alien retains everything it had back in 1979.<br/><br/>Everything from the atmosphere, the long shots, the slow build-ups, the creature design, the characters, the plot twist, I could go on. It really does become difficult to find flaws in this movie. Granted some of the FX are pretty dated now, but you have to remember how revolutionary they were back in the day.<br/><br/>Alien is a masterclass in sci-fi horror, far and few films can claim the level of superiority that Ridley Scott's masterpiece still holds."

","It is impossible for me to write an objective review of ALIEN simply because I believe it is not just the best motion picture film ever made, but is a pinnacle of artistic expression that owes its debt to pretty much everything that came before it. The story was a cultural funnel into which it all flowed. The only thing it can be correctly compared to might be the original 1977 release of STAR WARS even though its objectives could not have been more different. It is the most thorough and convincing portrayal of the future ever committed to celluloid. Certainly more convincing than 2001: A SPACE ODDITY, which is too sterile and gleaming. The future will not look like a dentist's office.<br/><br/>The future will be ugly, loud and busy. It will be a retrofitted mess of the past, present and futuristic forms. Like a city which adapts to changing times by modernizing certain parts while still facilitating its old function with its crumbling old infrastructure. If you're curious to see what the future of commercial space travel may look like watch this film. Humans will come and go, we may be tooling about on space craft, we may be crossing vast distances of space, and yes: It stands to reason we will encounter life forms startlingly different than ourselves. Unless we are very lucky it is almost inevitable that like other creatures on this planet they will react to us with fear, hostility or aggression for primal reasons related to territoriality or survival. It is doubtful we will have much in common.<br/><br/>We won't meet these alien life forms by looking for them. We will come across them as we go about our human ways, pressing deeper into the universe while going about our mundane business on the surfaces of worlds never meant to accommodate warm blooded protein and sugar consuming bipedal air breathers. I doubt the aliens we do find will look like HR Giger's creations, but at least in Giger we finally had an artist's vision for a life form that is suitable for the vastness of space. It is infinitely adaptable, roughly taking the form of whatever creature it gestates inside of and born ready-made to thrive in whatever the host's native environment may be. It's a weapon — natural or engineered, doesn't matter — a DNA replicating machine which mimics its host creature so it may corrupt and devour it more efficiently. <br/><br/>Here it takes the bastardized form of a man and effortlessly eliminates five human adults inside of 48 hours. It would have infected whatever biosphere it was introduced into, skillfully devouring, replicating, spawning and breeding until a critical mass is reached and all other forms of life in that biosphere would be eliminated in a survival of the fittest test with one inevitable outcome. The only way that its threat would be believable and frightening is if the fictional universe the story takes place in is 100% convincing. ALIEN's is, boasting the most effective production design in the history of cinema, bested only by NASA's Apollo moon landing program.<br/><br/>We believe in the universe it is set, the people who inhabit it, and the hardware they use to perform the tasks required by their mode of existence. If we were not thoroughly convinced the entire premise would fall like a house of cards. Ridley Scott, Dan O'cannon, Ron Shussett, Ron Cobb, Christopher Foss, H.R. Giger, John Mollo, Roger Dickens, Les Dilley, Brian Johnson, Jerry Goldsmith, Terry Rawlins, and the cast chosen to enact the story all collaborated seamlessly to produce a completely convincing facade telling a tightly plotted story about humans stumbling across an alien life form. Through duplicity and against protocol, the organism is allowed to infect the human biosphere within the ship, and the crew inevitably discover that the only way to contain the outbreak to their ship is to destroy it. It is a perfect metaphor for the necessary evils of modern life.<br/><br/>The film was successful and its dominance of the horror/action movie market spawned an outbreak of similarly themed films, some of which came close to replicating ALIEN's impact on our culture, but none really being able to introduce anything very useful to the premise. Queens laying eggs dumbs the creature down to familiar Terrestrial life patterns. I would prefer to think that the universe holds many surprises about how life thrives that aren't anything like the patterns we are comfortable with. The bug hunt in the first sequel is well done, but whatever success its offspring may have enjoyed all relate back to the singular vision and urgency behind the artistic quest that this film set out to resolve.<br/><br/>It does so in ways that go beyond the impact of individual scenes. Every film of its kind made since has been influenced by ALIEN in one way or another, and that influence will continue for as long as humans make films. Nobody will ever be able to ""undo"" its contributions, negate them from our society's palette. You can mix in Predators or A list casts with super-real computer effects, but it will always come back to this film and the startling possibilities it suggested. If it hadn't been done so well we wouldn't still be talking about it, proof that they really did get it right. We have only just begun to explore what forms the possibilities suggested by ALIEN may take, and someone someday will get it just as right in their own era's equivalent. <br/><br/>I hope I'm around to see that happen, maybe even have a hand in making it. Who knows.<br/><br/>10/10"

I'd never heard of Ridley Scott before... I came out of the cinema stunned and wanted to see this again immediately. To say it is one of the greatest sci- fi films of all time is under-rating it. It is one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>Performances that are pitch-perfect from a stellar cast. The first dirty, grungie space vessel that I'd seen in a film - more gritty and real than anything that had ever been offered up before. A freighter - not a fighter or a star-destroyer or something glamorous. Just a working freighter.<br/><br/>And a villain that was relentless, a perfect killing machine. Tougher than anything - with acid for blood! And in the end a heroine that was just as relentless. Ripley. Legendary now, revolutionary then.

","Alien is the 1979 classic horror creature film, it follows a group of ""space truck drivers"" in stasis when their ships AI, Mother, wakes them up prematurely to investigate a distress beacon on an unmapped planetoid called LV-426. Tom Skerritt plays the captain, Dallas, who convinces the team to suit up and investigate the distress beacon of unknown origin. Ripley, who is played by Sigourney Weaver, is second in command and seems to advise against the risky protocol. When Kane, played by John Hurt, looks into a pod on the abandoned ship a face hugger springs out and attached itself to him, incapacitating Kane. Ripley follows the quarantine procedure when notified that Kane has an unknown organism attached to him, disregarding the captain and various crew members begging to be let back on to help Kane. The medical officer on board, Ash, played by Ian Holm, decides to let them on anyway. After quarantining Kane finally, the organism dies and falls off. During dinner, before the crew is to go back to the stasis pods, Kane begins seizing and in a shocking turn of events a small creature is birthed out of his chest killing him instantly. The first theme appears here, it is uncomfortable because it is a theme of rape, and the concept of unwanted birth. The crew searches for the animal with nets and a cattle prod, only to discover that it has grown to be approx. 7-9 ft. and devours them one at a time when they least suspect it. The Alien uses its inner mouth to puncture and penetrate its victims, very disturbing imagery to convey rape. The Alien designer is a mechanical artist from Germany, who focused on sexual themes. His most prominent works include the Necronomicon, translated to ""The book of the dead"". Ripley, after communicating with the ships AI, discovers that the medical officer and mother have been in contact the entire mission, and that there is a mission protocol only made known to Ash that states: ""All other priorities rescinded, bring back life-form"". This begins to make more sense as Ash is a robot sent by ""the company"" which is Weyland-Yutani, to fulfill that mission even if it means killing the rest of the crew. Ripley finds out that the company had meant for all of this to happen before they had even left, finding the ship on LV-426, and bringing the creature back. The government is also working with the company Wey-Yu, Weyland-Yutani shortened, to develop this creature as a biological weapon. The main motivators for this behavior for the Govt. and the company is money, greed, and power. It would appear that the corruption of these powers at play would be a theme for the film as well as the entire franchise. Finally Ripley is the only one left, and she blows the ships reactor while escaping on a lifeboat pod to hopefully ensure the Aliens death. She realizes the Alien is also on the lifeboat in a state of hibernation, she suits up quietly and blows the Alien out of the air lock with a harpoon gun. She sets off in her vessel and goes into stasis hoping to be found by anyone in that section of the star system. The most effective scenes in my opinion would be through the uses of camera angles as well as lighting. For example, the scene where the full grown Alien attacks its first victim on the ship shows an angle that you can see the Alien in the background but it is so still in such an unnatural position that you don't take notice until it unfolds itself into the perfect predatory position to kill the crew member. Another example would be when the alien gets its first close up, the lighting mixed with the heavy drooling, and a terrific sound design makes for such a frightening moment. The captain goes into the bowls of the ship to snuff the creature out, when the motion detector becomes hard to read he runs right into the alien without knowing. Armed with a flamethrower that emits a flickering light, and a flash light, the alien is exposed with a quick turn of the lighting. The Alien leaps in full blown aggression screeching through the small ventilation shafts killing the captain. All of these things make for one of the best if not the best horror film of all time, arguably. I have personally seen this movie over 100 times, and it never gets old or less disturbing. Its themes are still relevant and I cannot recommend this film enough, if you have not seen it you are missing out on a cinematic experience that is on the top tier of film."

","Alien (1979)<br/><br/>To commemorate 4/26 Alien Day I thought I'd watch this movie. I think Ridley Scott is my favorite Ridley. That's saying a lot when you know how much I enjoy Daisy Ridley as an actress. Not only that, but he's also one of my favorite directors. Easily in my top 10 if not top 5. It's a shame that he's never won and Oscar.<br/><br/>Alien is a staple in Sci-fi Horror. It's a hard genre to mash together and produce something good, let alone phenomenal. With the exception of the Alien series I can only name Pandorum off the top of my head that would fit into that meld of genres.<br/><br/>Alien also had a strong female protagonist, one that wasn't really established as the main character till the second act. It's sort of reminiscent of Samus from Metroid.<br/><br/>Speaking of main characters: Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, is easily one of the most recognizable female characters in all of science fiction. I'd only suspect that maybe Princess Leia would be more. Even if it was her first time as the leading lady she did a wonderful job that stands the test of time.<br/><br/>I'd be hard press to not talk about Kane, played by John Hurt, as a demonstration of not only an intense and agonizing scene, but the wonderful use of practical effects that will terrorize and also make you feel pity for him. I won't spoil this old movie, but I'm sure you all know which scene I'm talking about. If you don't you'll know by the second act.<br/><br/>People seem to forget that Ash was played by Ian Holm. Bilbo from The Lord of the Rings, and Priest Vito Cornelius from Fifth Element. His scene towards the end of act II reminded me of playing Alien Isolation the video game. Though it should be the other way around. Remember the first time I saw Alien was when I was nine.<br/><br/>John McClane will be known for his catch phrase. Darth Vader for his many quotable lines. I believe Ripley has an amazing phrase she says in the movie that out of context is not a spoiler. ""I got you! You son-of-a-bitch.""<br/><br/>Can I say that the writing in this film is off the charts. People have a real reason for being there. Each character is on their own a beacon of personality. There isn't a character that's forgotten after watching the movie recently. I couldn't even name half of the party in the Hobbit and I saw that just the other day. Just goes to show you the respect I have for character development. Thank you Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett. They both worked on Total Recall, another great Sci- fi film.<br/><br/>Verdict: Cult Classic, must watch.

"sharky_55","9","3","4","17 April 2016"," Crew expendable.
","The opening of Alien recalls another sci-fi masterpiece, 2001 with its slow, labourious long takes that elegantly reveal its world (there's even a deleted Spaceballs-style shot where the gigantic Nostromo rolls over the top of the screen). Scott takes his time to introduce us to little bits of information as we need them - which is why the eventual reveal of Ash as an android is so effective. The assumed knowledge that with space travel comes advanced robotics has us second guessing every move even halfway through the movie. The camera-work is cautious in peering around each dim corner and ledge, as if it was a crew member in itself fearful for its own life. Modern horrors are always rushing to the next gory spectacle, the next money shot. Alien wants to milk every last drop of suspense of the universe's great unknown before it eats you up. <br/><br/>The action subscribes to the notion of less is more. The dark shadows of the ship hide the alien from plain sight - an organic evil shifting in and out of tech that for all its advancements is a futile barrier (it becomes a dripping, primordial environment, perfect for fostering life). This is foreshadowed by the way the acid makes it way through several layers of the ship. The actors react to what they see - the shock of a sudden movement or a shocking clue is not overloading by the soundtrack like so many conventional horror movies do. We are shown what we need to see - a glimpse of a tail coiling out of thee darkness, a blip on the monitor gaining on a helpless member, static on the screen - and then the deepest parts of our imagination fill in the gaps. <br/><br/>For the more explicit areas the effects are still excellent. One will never forget the first slow crane-up reveal of the gigantic alien pilot chair (I've always referred to this as the dentist chair) - a lifeless shell, but imposing nonetheless. There's a chilling sense of life within the alien baby, the way it abruptly breaches the boundaries of the spacesuit and coils around Kane's neck a little tighter when they try to remove it. A simple little premise renders their weapons useless - they are foolish to think they can capture it with a net and cattle prod, but it soon becomes a nightmare. The bursting of the chest - a bloody, visceral image that has become iconic because of the way it shocks and violates everything the crew thinks and knows of their safety and regulations. Ash's internal organs, a similarly grotesque sight, matched by his chilling mockery of humankind's chances - only a robot would be so gleeful and admirative of the perfect, remorseless organism gaining its survival by cutting down other living things (Asimov's rules come into play here). <br/><br/>Much has been made of the clear phallic symbolism - the spitting second mouth like a jutting penis, the vaginal walls pulsating and dripping with life, the impregnation of Kane as a vessel. It does not fully reconcile the act of stripping at the end for me. Weaver was young and pretty enough to be considered a sex symbol and the skimpy display here reduces her to a basic horror archetype - the vulnerable, sexy girl, the last one to be picked off. But it is only a minor grievance - Ripley is established as being clearly the one with the most sense and brains, and the studio obviously had faith in her by keeping her alive for potential sequels. Decades on this is still a remarkable sci-fi horror achievement."
"avik-basu1889","9","3","4","1 January 2016"," Truckers in Space !!!
","'Alien' is the first film in one of the most well known and renowned film franchises of all time. One of the major reasons why 20th Century Fox green-lit this film was the resounding success of another little film set in space known as 'Star Wars' at the box office. 'Alien' was based on a screenplay written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett and was directed by Ridley Scott. A crew aboard the space vessel Nostromo on their way home pick up an SOS warning from a distant planet. They decide to check out the planet and the subsequent events lead to an experience for the entire crew which can only be described as nightmarish. <br/><br/>Although Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's screenplay was great and had thematic depth, for me 'Alien' became the masterful horror film that it is due to one man's visual flair and complete command over the subtleties and nuances of filmmaking and camera movement, and that man is Ridley Scott. This film in the hands of some other director could have easily been reduced to a generic, silly genre film about alien monsters which were released in abundance during the 50s, 60s and 70s. But Ridley Scott made something that truly distinguished itself from all previous alien monster films. The claustrophobic atmosphere that Scott creates is enough to suck the viewer in. The film like most Ridley Scott films looks absolutely fantastic. The visual attention to detail is meticulous. The alien planet looks as real and authentic as any alien planet has ever looked on film. Scott slightly borrows the slow and gradual style of storytelling and tension building that Spielberg used in 'Jaws'. Like 'Jaws', we don't see the Xenomorph a lot. But that adds to the tension, the fear and the claustrophobia. The lighting, the editing and the pacing, all work together to the fullest effect.<br/><br/>Although most people make a connection between 'Star Wars' and 'Alien' due to their contrasting styles. Both the films were released very close to each other and both films were set in space. But while 'Star Wars' was a fantasy fairy tale, 'Alien' was straight up horror. I can understand this comparison, but for me 'Alien' shares a deep thematic connection with '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Both films deal with the duel between man and machine and they both explore the question: What it means to be human? Incidentally this was also the basic theme of Ridley Scott's next sci-fi film 'Blade Runner'. After knowing that Ash was actually a droid, on reflection, I do think that the relationship between Ash and Ripley has some similarities with the relationship between HAL and Bowman. Ripley at the beginning refuses to let Kane (John Hurt) in by obeying the company laws while he has the face- hugger on his face, but Ash actually lets him in which might seem to be a very humane act. But later his true identity gets revealed and he has this beautiful monologue about how he appreciates the Xenomorph's perfect body structure and its purity which lies in its lack of emotions and feelings. <br/><br/>This film is also undeniably about the ill-effects of capitalism. The Weyland-Yutani Corporation sends this crew to a mission as dangerous as this without informing them anything for the sole purpose of acquiring this alien life form and using it as a weapon. This shows the lack of humanity in the way the big corporation treats its workers. This lack of respect for the workers and the existing class division also gets repeatedly hinted at with Brett and Parker's constant complaints about being underpaid. These workers are made to go through hell and utter madness in distant parts of the universe where they themselves are alien just because the big corporation wants to use the Xenomorph for its weapons division. The miserable plight of the crew in completely mad and alien surroundings has a thematic link with the madness in 'Apocalypse Now' where young men are made to fight in mad environments. To be honest, the Xenomorph is not the villain in the film, the villain is the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.<br/><br/>Another very apparent element of the script is the sexual subtext. The Xenomorph and other alien elements and sets were designed by H.R. Giger based on his own artwork which clearly have sexual undertones. Right from the design of the Xenomorph's body to the concept of the face-hugger and chest-burster, there is a sexual angle to the narrative that hints at themes of rape and unwanted pregnancies. Through Ridley Scott's imagery, it is thematically implied that the corporation in the way it renders the human workers expendable is actually devouring them. The face-hugger uses the body of the host to give birth to the Xenomorph, in the same way thematically the corporation is using the helpless crew just to serve its own purposes. <br/><br/>Although the human characters in the film don't have a lot of back story, but the conversations that they have among each other are extremely realistic which makes the characters believable as ordinary human beings. Every character gets distinguished from the other due to the naturalistic acting. However for me the two best performances in the film come from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley and Ian Holm as Ash. They play off each other brilliantly. Ripley's character has evolved over the course of the entire Alien franchise. In this film Ripley is the indefatigable survivor.<br/><br/>I only have one minor complaint. I think the screenplay and Scott's execution of the scene leading up to Brett's death could have been a little better instead of following a bit of horror trope. However the death itself is chillingly shot.<br/><br/>'Alien' is one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made due to the care with which Ridley Scott treated every individual element of the film and also due to every one else who worked with Scott and contributed with their own ideas."

","This suspenseful, spine-tingling movie keeps you on the edge of your seat right up to the time it's finished. When you watch this one, you feel like a good friend (by good I mean shrewd in picking movies) has brought it to your house to have a great movie night. In other words, it seems like director had seen it several times before he made it. He is that friend of yours by the way. A huge spacecraft has finished its mission and is heading back to Earth. We the crew members get up from their sleeping pods, they realize the spaceship is out of its course. Apparently it has received a signal from another planet, indicating some alien life form and set off to accomplish it secondary mission: investigating life in space. The extra- terrestrial life they find is by no mean friendly and brings horror into the ship.<br/><br/>It's more of a horror film than a science fiction one. I am sure you have seen those horror films in which some people are stuck in a hut in jungle and there is some nasty creature lurking to hunt them one by one. Well, now make the hut full of small rooms and send it to space. This, has provided director with a lot of close-ups which sends a shiver to your spine. It keeps you guessing when something is going to jump into the frame from an angle and kill people on board. But the brilliance of the movie is in what it doesn't show. By this, I mean unlike other horror movies you don't see people running around, crying or screaming ( not that much anyway). Also, when the astronauts find the organism, they do not celebrate nor freak out. They act vary nonchalant like they come across these things all the time. And this, has saved a lot of time and helped the director and audience focus on the story.<br/><br/>A lot of unnecessary scenes have been cut out. And there's your good friend Ridely, selflessly sparing you from all the fake screams and tears. At times you guess you are going to see some sentimental crying or other reactions, but it never happens. Well, crew members are scientists and not some clueless teenagers. Sometimes in comedies, actors act normally in funny situations which makes it even funnier. This technique has been applied here and if you ask me it has worked like a dream; a scary one too.<br/><br/>Right at the beginning of the movie, the camera is roaming in the spacecraft which seems horrifyingly deserted. While we are curious to see some people or aliens, we reach a room in which astronauts are sleeping in their pods. And when the camera approaches the room, the automatic door goes up. This, throws the audience right to the spaceship. There is another scene in which the senior commander, frustrated to find a way to kill the monster, tries to get some answer form the computer brain of the craft called Mother( discover the irony yourself). He keeps asking about the creature but the computer has insufficient knowledge. Then with all his hope gone he types: 'What are my chances?'"

I'm not a sci-fi fan and I don't particularly care for Sigourney Weaver. However, I created this numeric review system since the last time I saw this film, and I have reviewed 130 or so films now for IMDB. Regularly reviewing films with this metric has changed the way I watch a movie. Now, there is this constant comparison in my mind, weighing the qualities of the film I am watching verses all other films of the genre.<br/><br/>'Alien' (1979) is one of the greatest films of all time. The 1970's effects not only hold up, but are still impressive, due to extraordinary cinematography. Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ripley and she adds surprise sexuality to the film toward the end. The writing shows the ship to be a microcosm of societal conflicts - duty verses survival, equal pay for equal work, and the battle for women's equality in group decision making. And, then there is The Alien. I capitalize his name (or title?) because he is one of the biggest box office draws of all time. Nicholas Cage wishes he had the career of The Alien.<br/><br/>This film has some great qualities and no noticeable flaws.

","Horror movies today could take a step back, take a long look, and find their own piece to take. Now, of course, I sincerely believe the film industry should try it's best to be original, although let's be honest, that won't happen. Everything in this movie is perfect, I mean that. The script never falls apart with one of the most steady spaced movies I have ever watched. The acting is unknowingly great, depending on your observations of certain characters. The ship is fully developed, with a crew that does not hesitate in any scene with their brilliant chemistry. The ship design feels dirty and lived in, keeping the advanced look. Every time a button is pressed to put in commands or a lever is pulled the ship responds. The Alien design is many peoples favorites, feeling real. For 1979 this movie is revolutionary in visuals and props, never looking too fake. If there is anything I would have to say this movie does best on, it is the cinematography. Derek Vanlint gave the job of a lifetime, alongside Ridley Scott. Alien is one of my favorite movies if you have never watched it....fix that. Alien, of course, gets a perfect score."
"Pramitheus","10","4","6","15 May 2016"," Don't land on unknown PLANETS!!
","I am watching this movie in 2016 and still the practical effects almost made me puke. Ridley Scott's space horror is one for the classics. I have obviously watched many movies with gore and aliens and sometimes both but all of them try to force feed you. The set pieces don't seep in and the audience is made to jump from one gory situation to another. BUT this is Ridley Scott we are talking about. The one who started it all. I actually had watched Prometheus 1st and had a vague idea about the Alien franchise. Now after re-watching Alien I am beginning to connect the dots.<br/><br/>The plot is probably known to everyone by now. So just skipping over that. Starting with the direction. The slow paced direction allows you to feel the atmosphere. The situation. It makes you understand the psyche of each of the crew members aboard the Nostromo. You start to care and while watching it I often wished to not get emotionally involved because I knew what was to follow. The face-hugger scenes was much more creepy and disgusting than when the Alien arrives, because the Alien is shown in the dark and mysterious. So the effect of the goriness is only understood when the witnesses arrive but the face-hugger is on screen. It is puke-worthy. <br/><br/>The acting was very natural. The lines almost seemed unscripted. The equation between all the crew members was very evident from the beginning. I should seen through the fact that Ash was an android but it was well hinted throughout the film. It is very subtle. So subtle that you are bound to miss . As I said, the pacing is very steady. You'll feel the fear. The set-design is amazing. All in all it was a enjoyable movie. Ridley Scott is the master of space oriented movies.<br/><br/>Final warning. IF ANY ASTRONAUT IS READING THIS AND WANTS TO SPACE TRAVEL, DON'T LAND ON UNKNOWN PLANETS"

With a strong director the artistry came together to make one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>Others may disagree but I wasn't impressed by the acting.

"doctorcrypticat","10","4","6","4 March 2016"," A forefather to horror
","Alien (1979) is easily one of the greatest horror films of its time, and is still today. The atmosphere it provides along with the setting go hand in hand. Providing an almost claustrophobic environment with nowhere to truly run and hide. With its tag line, 'In space no one can hear you scream,' becomes true. The characters having no one to contact or to run away being that they're blanketed by space. The unique personalities of all the characters make them each interesting for their own ways. And the build up and tension created by the movie allows for the scares to come much easier. This has been and may forever be my favorite movie."

","This movie is the best horror movie ever! It has a very spooky feeling and you can watch this movie over and over again and never gets boring. In my opinion I think alien is better than aliens but that is a question of taste. Sigournew Weaver is an excellent actress and really gets the movie to be that spooky that it really is. When I said that is a classic movie, I really mean it. It has has mystery, entertaining and very good actors. Even that the film was made in 1979 it still feels very good and new in some way. The cons of this movie is that the computers in this film is old, but that dos not have a big deal, and you don't notice it to much. Overall this movie really shows what a horror movie looks like and I give it a big thumbs up and I would love to see it again."
"petra_ste","10","4","6","12 March 2014"," I admire its purity
","Less is more in the horror genre. Give us a fight between a giant humanoid albino and an octopus-like creature and we'll think of the special effects guy eating a taco in front of his PC screen as he is rendering the octopus' slime. Show us a maze of dark corridors where a monster may be hiding, and our pulse rate rises. We don't need to be bludgeoned in the head with horrific imagery: glimpsing something creepy out of the corner of the eye is more than enough.<br/><br/>Alien's closest kinship is not to the exhilarating but vastly different sequel Aliens, and certainly not to the clunky prequel Prometheus, but to its contemporaries Jaws and The Thing, horror movies as lean and taut as hungry tigers, masterpieces tapping on primordial fears. For Alien, it's predators and rape: the first is self-explanatory, the second a disturbing undertone running throughout the movie, with the creature's attacks portrayed as increasingly sexualized in nature.<br/><br/>The quintessential contained sci-fi/horror, Alien's iconic status is a product of many factors: Scott's masterful direction, a fine cast, Giger's still unparalleled reptilian monster and O'Bannon's script, as vicious and essential as a bear trap ready to snap. The brilliance of the premise - reminiscent of an episode of Van Vogt's The Voyage of the Space Beagle - lies in implying a dark, almost Lovecraftian universe full of mysterious looming threats, both horribly dangerous and beyond mankind's understanding. Then of course came Prometheus and started putting tags on what was best left merely alluded to.<br/><br/>At the end, Ian Holm's Ash says it best: ""Perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility."" <br/><br/>10/10"
"tedg","Null","10","20","27 June 2001"," Different Worlds
","Different Worlds<br/><br/>Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I've just rewatched `Alien,' `Aliens' and `Alien Resurrection.' Considered simply as films, each is a fine film but they come from worlds that are more different from each other than the normative world of now is to the world of any of them. Just viewing them is a course in filmmaking.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's `Alien' is the most impressive, knowing that it was only his second film, that every effect is physical, and that the budget was so low the spacecraft is cobbled together from used aircraft parts. Even at this early point, Scott has the ability to create a unique look and has the mastery of craft to coordinate every element (acting, score, movement) to reinforce that look. That he chose Giger to base the look on was brilliant. Organic darkness -- evil embodied in living things. The alien ship, though only briefly shown, is a sequence that will live way past the time that the monsters of the series are forgotten; that blending of beast, environment and narrative is unique in all filmdom. Really amazing that the sequels didn't go back to that ship. Scott has grown to be one of our best and most original filmmakers -- Alien and `Blade Runner' (with `Forbidden Planet') are the very best `real' scifi films we have, meaning films that are not just adventure films.<br/><br/>Where `Alien' is scifi in the service of horror, `Aliens' is scifi in the service of action. Aliens is a war film, and equally impressive as one of Cameron's earliest. Movement and conflict. More emphasis on the familiar is necessary for this approach, so we see the sets and costumes less adventuresome. This is a thrill which uses the trappings of scifi only as another thing with which to impress. The mood created is projected not into the image as with Scott, but into the theater as something to amaze. Cameron hasn't evolved at all from this film, only been given ever bigger effects with which to amaze. So one might consider this his most `genuine' film.<br/><br/>`Resurrection' seems to not be as admired by the fan base. But I think it every bit the equal of the other two. In this case, we also have a new director, a European with two fantasy tales under his belt. But those set a tone that is strikingly weird: the tone not in the setting, but in the psychological space in the story. And that's what we have here. In Cameron's film, every character is a stereotype. Here, every character is an anti-stereotype: the black guy isn't jive; the cripple is the toughest; the sex kitten is a robot... even the hero isn't really. This is also the most cinematic use of the camera, using the psychological eye. Scott dwells, Cameron moves, Jeunet examines. He doesn't mind annotating the past films (rather like Van Sant's `Psycho' annotates Hitchcock's).<br/><br/>The only negative thing I note in the sequels is that Weaver isn't adaptable enough to understand and get behind these diverse visions. She understands Scott. Cameron doesn't really care, but she is outclassed by Jeunet.<br/><br/>Seeing any one of these enhances the appreciation for the other two."
"preppy-3","1","104","302","12 March 2002"," Very overrated--boring
","SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!<br/><br/>How this is considered a classic is beyond me.  I saw it when it first came out in 1979.  I was 16--I was basically bored or disgusted by it.  22 years later my opinion hasn't changed.  Why do I hate this?  Let me count the ways:<br/><br/>1) The plot is old hat.  It's basically a haunted house movie set in outer space.<br/><br/>2)  There is zero characterization.  The crew members are virtually interchangable.  How can you care about somebody getting killed when you don't know who they are?<br/><br/>3)  Getting a bunch of talented actors and giving them nothing to work with.<br/><br/>4)  Overdone set design.  Yes, it's impressive but it overwhelms what little plot there is.  Nice set design does not make a movie.<br/><br/>5)  People stumble around in dark corridors and dark rooms looking for a cat.  Not once but TWICE!  And this is after they know there's a killer alien on board!<br/><br/>6)  What the hell is a cat doing on a space mission?  <br/><br/>7)  The characters act incredibly stupid.<br/><br/>8)  The alien looks dumb--it's just a guy in a slightly modified alligator suit.  Cool set of double teeth though.<br/><br/>9)  What does the alien do with its victims?  Two of them just disappear.<br/><br/>10)  Why is the alien killing them?  What reason?  We're never given one. Oh wait--because it's in the script.  That's why!<br/><br/>11)  Sigourney Weaver strips to down to her underwear for no reason whatsoever at the end.<br/><br/>12)  IT'S DULL!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>The only scene that works is the chest burster with John Hurt--but that's only a minute or two in a two hour film.  Long, dull and stupid.  I give this a 1--I wish I could go lower--it deserves a 0.  Avoid at all costs. See ""Aliens"" instead.  That's 100 times better than this."
"bowmanblue","10","7","13","28 September 2014"," The film that started it all
","I'm writing this review not because I think 'Alien' needs another 5* review, but because I read a post on an internet message board by someone saying, 'I can't believe this piece of junk is considered scary!' So, I re-watched Alien, trying to see if I could see where this poster was coming from. I guess there are now two types of viewers. The first - like me - grew up on Alien in the late seventies/early eighties, where it was one of the most ahead of its time films ever made. It started off the whole 'monster-munching' movie genre, where a lone creature stalks and eliminates a team/crew/whatever one by one. There have been countless B-movies made since its release in 1979 which have tried - unsuccessfully - recapture its look, feel and financial viability, but pretty much all have failed.<br/><br/>Then you have the new generation - those who have grown up with 'Avatar' as the 'normal' quality of film. It's fair to say that Avatar is a vastly superior film to Alien, but only because it has the budget etc. If you're used to seeing thousands of alien creatures fighting over a mystical landscape, watching a single creature (which, as some times, comes across very much as a bloke in a suit) jump out of the darkness about five times in two hours, comes as a bit of a let-down.<br/><br/>However, when it comes to purity, Alien will beat pretty much every movie ever made (even its highly-regarded successor, 'Aliens,' which - although also excellent, is not as pure as the original, as it blends genres more).<br/><br/>If you know Alien and generally appreciate horror and/or science-fiction, you'll probably already love it. However, if you're new to the genre and primarily are used to modern filming techniques, you may have to put yourself in the place of the audiences back in 1979, who had never seen such a claustrophobic and tense piece of horror.<br/><br/>The xenomorph itself, now looking a little dated (in my opinion the dragon-thing at the end of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland looked more horrific!) may not cut it compared with modern special effects, but - again - it was way ahead of its time. Alien will stand the test of (cinematic) time. Film history will always have a place of it (and Aliens), just don't go thinking that films have always been made the way Avatar and Lord of the Rings have."

Along the way they receive a distress signal. They go and investigate and everything takes a turn for the worst when a crew member comes back on board with a parasite attached to his face.

","A rat in the attic is a good metaphor for this unimaginative ""sci-fi"" flick from director Ridley Scott. The human crew aboard a Hollywood-conceived spacecraft diddle and dawdle. They chitchat about this and that; they eat; they smoke; they look at outdated computer screens; they emit petty frustrations. Finally, after interminable plot filler, and after our space voyagers have displayed requisite incompetence (what would film stories be without incompetence?), ET shows up on-board, less cosmic than sleazy, like something the cat drug in from a b-grade horror flick. Now, our beleaguered ... and incompetent ... crew promptly sets forth to deal with the menace.<br/><br/>But our spacecraft-trapped rat has vanished into the woodwork, probably to escape the crew's incompetence and/or all the hammy acting. Where did ET go? Behind the stove? Under the frig? Inside the computer? Nope, he's in the attic. Quick, fumigate. Oops, too late. The house is condemned.<br/><br/>I'm constantly amazed how easily sci-fi fans can be satisfied by conventional, stodgy stories, and cheesy, overbearing special effects.

The actors are great, especially Sigourney Weaver, and she is very good as portraying Lt. Ripley. The movie is set in the future, and is basically about a spaceship that gets a call while in space to check out a distress signal coming from a distant planet. The crew of the spaceship come into contact with an alien lifeform, and must fight to survive, as well as save the human race. The feel of the movie and characters is very authentic, which, (along with the excellent story), is why I love it so much.

","Not much to say that hasn't been said about Alien. I am doing my small part to pump the rating up to a solid 9 where it belongs.<br/><br/>I saw this on the big screen during it's opening week when I was 11 in a REAL theater - huge (holding 1075 people), packed house, spring-rocking seats, 70mm film, six track Dolby...wondrous. I have watched Alien at least 50 times since and I will never grow tired of it.<br/><br/>The overall mood of the film is chilling and suspenseful. The detail and sheer beauty of the Nostromo's interior is stunning. I could easily watch an entire hour of slow, sweeping pans of the rooms and corridors alone. Nothing before or since has ever come close.<br/><br/>The special effects in Alien are fantastic by any standard. Yes, there is one scene in which someone attempts to stand something upright on a table and another where something appears to be moving on a dolly that reveal some limitations, but these are more than acceptable trade-offs for the realism of makeup versus CGI. I am sure the editors wished they had a few more takes to work with, but they did their best with the shots they had and these very minor flaws do not detract.<br/><br/>I would have thought that by now, CGI would be a match for ""old-fashioned"" silicone and makeup, but sadly no. CGI still looks fake and has never produced a single, believable, creature or superhero in all these years. Ever. I find that very sad. I don't know if it is because the technology for realism just isn't here yet or if it is simply a lack of human talent in adding in the ""imperfections"" that make things look real. I suspect it's a combination of both plus a lack of budget for the time it would take and I don't think we will see real-looking CGI for at least another 30 years. I wish more films today would shun CGI altogether. Models, silicone and makeup are far superior. Come on CGI effects teams - CATCH UP! <br/><br/>Well, that's my rant on CGI... But although the sets and effects are wonderful, Alien is not a special effects film. It is pure suspense and horror in a sci-fi setting, done to perfection.<br/><br/>Alright that's enough. If you are the one person alive who hasn't seen this, what are you waiting for? If sci-fi or slow suspense is not your cup of tea, so be it. It takes all kinds to make a world, but give it a shot - give it its due. Alien is truly an amazing work of art."

","I give it a 10/10 without doubt. I am not giving it a 10/10 out of compassion but because of the creative and cinematographic (relative)perfection. Please mind that even though it has a new directors cut re-release, this movie is actually a full 25 years old!!! Even when you watch it now it stands it own and that is the magnificence of the art-director and of Ridley Scott, the film director.<br/><br/>Ah then you get to see one of the best (or simply the best) female action heroes ever created on screen. Sigourney Weaver is just so memorable. Please don't forget that the brilliance of this movie launched a whole quadrology. That itself is a testament to this first one: Alien. The second one Aliens directed by James Cameroon is an epic in itself but much of the foundation was (perhaps inadvertently) laid by Ridley Scott in this movie. Please note another side effect was that female heroes were used by Hollywood after this movie in very big productions.<br/><br/>Each shot, each scene and sequences build up the film in a fantastic manner that is old school but still so difficult to achieve. It is like Da Vinchi's painting. It is old school style. But still difficult to do. Story is about the crew of a mining ship who end up with an alien while answering an SOS call. Alien: not as in an illegal immigrant (er.. this is not a political movie about borders and immigration...) Alien as in the most scary creature ever devised. Truly alien. In every way it is so brilliant. <br/><br/>I had a great experience when I watched it again. Definitely one of the all time greatest movies."

I responded. Truly, nothing had actually happened in 20 minutes.<br/><br/>This is an unusually slow-moving movie. Contrary to arguments voiced here, movies were definitely paced faster than this at the time. (Except maybe Solaris and 2001) Yes, that's right, in 1983 we already thought this was slow. This is the movies major problem. It has only mood, production design, and a couple of scares. It's slow in the wrong parts and quick where it should be more developed. It takes 40 minutes to locate the distressed ship, which introduces the conflict, and 15 minutes near the end is devoted to the self-destruct sequence, and what's left over (the plot - killing everybody) is perfunctory and still dull somehow. 5 minutes for Harry Dean Stanton to look for a cat? A long self destruct sequence starts, an attempt is made to reverse it, then it goes ahead anyway. The reversal effort does nothing but increase the running time. Once on board the Sulaco, the alien spends a lot of time mugging from his perch in some pipes. It's destroyed about four seconds after it frees itself; a wasted opportunity. <br/><br/>I just watched it again to see if I needed to reassess; there was no need. I completely honor it's achievement of changing sci-fi movies, but structurally it's bare. Characters are vaguely sketched in. Ad-libbed dialogue around the meal-table would have been a swell place to deepen the characters, not keep the language inaudible and trifling. It has no ideas. If you provide no ideas to think about, pacing is critical. Cameron was a better director for this type of thing as he proved with the superior sequel. This is reputed to be the first time blue collar workers are shown in space. Perhaps trying to look casual in space, Tom Skerrit is deliberately low-key and contributes to the films lethargy. Yaphett Koto receives the dumbest expository line in the script (""Ash is a ROBOT?"") Yes, we're all about 3 minutes ahead of you there. Ridley Scott has an eye for detail, but he's just the wrong director for horror. It's just too arty to be scary. When Dallas gets it, there's a shock appearance of the alien who makes the ""Ta-daaaaa!"" gesture with his hands which is unintentionally funny, not scary. There's enough bad direction like that to kill the mood. And a cat is a lame reason (& a lousy device) to continually leave your co-workers to die. <br/><br/>On top of that the design for these DVD menus is very irritating. Gigers design for the majestic, evil alien is still astonishing."

","I never was a big fan of the Alien series. Always thought that they were way too dumb. However, i've never watched the very first one; the one which started everything, the original Alien. Until today. And to be honest, i am a bit disappointed. It's a very well made film, even more for the standards of 1979, but to the story itself...well, i just don't care for it at all. Sure, the film has great visuals, the spacecraft is full of interesting details, but the story is dry. The character development is not adequate at all, and this is an aspect which i consider fundamental in any film. We don't have any deep idea of who are the persons in there, or what they were doing, or what they are going to do. Then, the thriller? Almost none. And it's not scary. To the well of the truth, almost all the times the 'scariest' moments were very predictable and even unintentionally comic.<br/><br/>But nice. It's a classic, right? Well, personally, i don't give a dawn. Because besides the fact that it is an extremely well made thriller with an Alien as the main villain , It has nothing more to add. Maybe it was very good back in the 70s and 80s, but not anymore. 7.3/ 10"

"Corky1984","Null","5","9","14 June 2005"," An all-time classic that stands the test of time
","Alien is one of Ridley Scott's masterpieces. What is so impressive about the film is that the pacing feels exactly right. There is an ideal blend of character development, suspense and then action. For 1979, the special effects are surprisingly good and many years later the film still looks great. The Alien is of course one of cinema's greatest creations, the shape of the creature being unlike any other and holding a wonderful distinctiveness. The storyline is simple, but effective. Corporate greed forces the mining crew to investigate a planet on their way back to earth. Inhabited by scores of strange slimy eggs, one of the crew, John Hurt, is attacked by a reptilian like 'hand with a tail' for want of a better phrase. Stuck to his face it is planting an alien inside him, an alien that spectacularly erupts from him whilst eating dinner! There then follows the rest of the film in which the remaining crew members hunt for the escaped beast, unaware initially that it is growing ever larger and deadlier. One by one the crew are picked off in a series of well executed scenes that are at times subtle and then violent. Sigourney Weaver eventually emerges as the star of the film, the last one left on-board the space ship. Along the way she uncovers the chicanery of Ian Holm's Ash character, who is in fact an android working for the company and operating a myriad of Machiavellian policies. In one of the highlights of the film, she battles with the out of control Ash in a frantic attempt to learn the truth and save her life. The film ends in typically dramatic style and leaves you feeling more than entertained. The next three films in the series were all good efforts, but perhaps this one is the best? Regardless of its ranking, it merits a place in any film fan's collection."
"lotus_chief","6","8","17","27 July 2004"," A bit overrated?. (my 100th review)
","I bought this DVD, thinking it's a certified classic and that I'm bound to enjoy it immensely...seeing that I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies. After watching it, I thought I missed something. Was this really it? <br/><br/>After realizing my less-than-enthusiastic thoughts on what I had just seen, I immediately rationalized that I did just watch the movie 25 years later, and that there's probably no way I can get the effect that audiences had when it first released. So much has happened in movies nowadays, that I've basically seen it all. I appreciate what Ridley Scott tried to do here, by letting us wait, and wait, and wait, and wait some more. It's Hitchcockian, and I'm a big fan of his. 'Alien' is more suspense than anything, it seemed that after the suspense is gone, and everything that was supposed to happen happened, and the alien was finally revealed in all its glory, there isn't much left to hold on to. For some reason, 'Alien' comes off as incomplete and, surprisingly, unintentionally funny at some points. I just couldn't get past the fact that the events in the film could've been avoided if it wasn't for the utter stupidity of the crew members. 'Alien' wasn't scary by any means. The alien itself is marvelous; I was always intrigued by the creature, just the look of it! Only a crazy mind could've come up with something looking like that. <br/><br/>I've read some reviews here on IMDb stating that the sequel 'Aliens' is superior to the original, I'll have to see that to decide for myself. Also, I only watched the Theatrical version on my DVD, maybe I'll be able to appreciate the Director's Cut more?although I read in the DVD pamphlet that the Theatrical version is Ridley Scott's favorite. Therefore, I'm giving 'Alien' a pass of sorts, seeing that it's a landmark in a genre that's been squeezed dry for so long now. Maybe with future viewings I can come to enjoy it even more, but my initial reaction is that 'Alien' wasn't what I expected. I can still appreciate it for the pioneer that it is, but it seems a bit overrated.<br/><br/>** ½ out of **** stars"

Showing a scene to open space ship and kick out Alien out of the door like James Bond kicking some guy out of Aeroplane here on Earth was really out of way. I mean what about temperature, air pressure if there is still any after opening up door like that.

","I wasn't real impressed with this movie because it seemed like any other horror movie, but in a science fiction setting. <br/><br/>In fact, I believe that was the secret to the movie's success. Take your typical horror movie plot - a monster is stalking a group of people, killing them one by one - and set it in the future, in space, and you've got Alien. It probably attracted a lot of science fiction fans to horror and horror fans to science fiction.<br/><br/>From a more esoteric standpoint, I was disappointed that the settings were so dark. Maybe it worked on the big screen, but it failed in my living room.<br/><br/>
Credit-wise I'm curious to know why Tom Skeritt had top billing over Sigourney Weaver. The latter's character is obviously our hero and has all the best lines, while the former's character is killed halfway through the movie. <br/><br/>It would be like giving Jack Palance top billing in City Slickers, although he contributed much more to that movie than Skeritt contributed to Alien."

","Nice to see that a few all too rare reviewers agree that Ridley Scott`s ALIEN is a rather overrated film , yes I agree with everyone that the set design is fantastic but the film suffers from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY syndrome in that it has a very slow sterile atmosphere which makes it difficult to connect with the characters . The only character I felt any sympathy with was Kane and that`s only because he was played by the excellent John Hurt . As for the rest of the crew I couldn`t care less if they got eaten or not . To all intents ALIEN is a corny B movie script ( I think we can ignore all the pseudo-intellectual claptrap involving subtext - it`s a B movie script ) produced by A list technicians <br/><br/>Trivia point : Ridley Scott was working as a BBC designer in 1963 and legend has it that he was due to work on a fledgling sci-fi series but became unavailable at the last moment which meant Raymond Cusack worked on this new show called DOCTOR WHO and it was he who designed the Daleks undoubtedly the most visually interesting creations in the history of television.<br/><br/>Talking of DOCTOR Who check out the 1975 story ` The Ark In Space ` which has a very similar premise to ALIEN  but is far more enjoyable"

I was dumbfounded by the shocking idiocy of the plot.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the film definitely deserves the recognition it received for awesome visual effects. The 3 is for the special effects. The rest contribute to exactly 0.<br/><br/>The experience started going downhill, about 16 minutes in, when the ship lands on the alien planet and stuff starts to short out and smoke starts bellowing out of unseen orifices. One wonders how the crew got into space with that kind of build quality.<br/><br/>Then there is captain Dallas who orders Ridley to open the airlock when there's a unknown alien organism attached to officer Kane's face, and that too against sensible quarantine protocol.<br/><br/>This is the trigger at which point the typical big-budget film stereotype for such situations emerges, with warrant officer Ripley (could be anyone really) refusing to obey the captain's (Dallas') orders while some other character takes the captain's side, to set in motion the chain of events that lead to ""the disaster"". Unfortunately, this is the typical formula that's been tried, rehashed, and regurgitated time and again in big-budget movies out of Hollywood.<br/><br/>All the characters except Ripley's are just there as objects for ""The Alien"" to poke at, for fun.

","Almost thirty years have passed since Alien made its first appearance, becoming an instant classic, opening the doors of Hollywood to director Ridley Scott and starting one of the best-known franchises to have ever graced the screen. Thirty years, and the movie is still as fresh, brilliant and scary as it was back in 1979, perhaps because no other film (with the exception of James Cameron's superb sequel, Aliens) has yet been able to match its claustrophobic mood and moments of sheer, unadulterated dread.<br/><br/>Of course, by now everyone knows what the alien looks like, but when he inadvertently started the series Scott made the wise decision of keeping it mostly unseen: the ghastly creature is almost never shown in its entirety, preferring to lurk in the shadows as the unaware human characters gradually realize what's happening. In fact, the first half-hour or so of the film is spent to introduce the protagonists and get a better understanding of their relationship, which, as in many other similarly themed movies, is tense. Justifiably, since the nine astronauts have been together on the Nostromo for a lot of time, sent on a mission in outer space by a mysterious Company. Suddenly, they receive a distress signal from a remote planet and decide to take a better look at what's going on. Within hours, they will regret it. Hopefully, the people watching this film won't.<br/><br/>Some parts of the movie could be dismissed as clichés, but the truth is, of course, that Alien actually CREATED many of the stereotypes of recent sci-fi (crew being wiped out from within, no one out there to help them, et cetera). Plus, the film is so solid and consistently captivating it is hard to stop and think of possible leaks in the plot. As a pure exercise is suspense and horror, Alien has no rivals, Scott's clever use of lighting and camera angles ensuring the claustrophobia and tension never drop. He is also helped in this by choosing to keep the villainous creature in the dark most of the time, perfectly adhering to the old principle of ""the less you show, the better"" (something Spielberg and Carpenter applied with equal success on Jaws and Halloween). And while the characters may have been developed better in the sequels, what we have here is enough to qualify as convincing and likable, thanks mainly to a spot-on cast: Sigourney Weaver, a complete unknown at the time, is mesmerizing in the role that made her an A-lister and finally put an end to the Hollywood tradition of women being no good other than when it comes to running and screaming. The supporting cast is every bit as strong, with John Hurt (who is the unsung hero of the entire franchise's most celebrated sequence) and Ian Holm in particular adding to the film's unsettling atmosphere.<br/><br/>Briefly, one of the Top 10 greatest science-fiction/horror (it fits equally well on either list) films ever, and, Blade Runner and Gladiator aside, the high point of Ridley Scott's career.

","SPOILER ALERT. I suppose it's asking too much to want a sci-fi movie that's halfway intelligent. ""Alien"" is not. If you start thinking about this movie, it falls apart. I'll try to be brief. One, if I'm not missing something, the ""Company"" that owns the spaceship knows about this horrible alien monster, knows it ""can't be killed"" (Ash, the robot, actually says this), and wants the monster brought back to Earth, ""crew expendable."" Question, if the monster can't be killed, but it kills each and every human it sees, how the heck are they going to get it off the spaceship when it gets back to Earth? And what will they do with it then? That's absurd. Two, how does the Company know the spaceship crew will even get the monster on board to bring it back in the first place? There's no way at all for the Company to assume this. Three, the only reason the monster got inside the spaceship was because of an incredibly stupid thing one of the crew did. If you were on an unknown alien planet and you saw some ""eggs,"" would you try to go down and sniff at them and put your face as close to them as possible? And when one of them started to open, would you just stand there and get even closer to it? This is beyond stupid, it's insane. Four, once the monster is on the ship and hugging this guy's face, it disappears, and suddenly another monster pops out of his chest. Seriously? This rather sizable alien being with a big ugly head has been living inside a man's chest but he never felt any pain and none of his organs suffered any damage, not his lungs, not his heart, nothing? I didn't buy that for one second. Five, this creature supposedly has ""molecular acid"" (ha ha) flowing through its body, an acid so strong that it can eat right through steel like a knife through warm butter -- but the creature itself is immune? Right. Six, once the entire crew except for Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is dead, she decides to blow up the ship and escape in the shuttle. So she has to go through a cumbersome series of physical actions, including pulling up big tubes, just to set a destruct signal, and then it gives her ten minutes -- ten minutes, folks -- to go to the bathroom, find her cat, get to the shuttle, strip down to her micro-panties for us, ten minutes. In a sane world, on a sane ship, you'd be able to set the destruct for any time you liked, and you'd be able to get on the shuttle first and then activate the destruct signal. Finally, only a guess from the way they made it look, but evidently the ship was destroyed in a nuclear explosion, while Ripley is still close enough that she (and her cat) would be killed by the radiation. (Even in ""Forbidden Planet"" they knew enough to get the ship far away from the explosion.) So, for all those reasons, this is a movie that is so scientifically stupid and impossible that I couldn't believe it or enjoy it at all. Where are Joel and the bots when you need them?"
"The-Last-Prydonian","9","11","28","1 September 2009"," In space no-one can hear you yawn
","Often copied and inspiring countless knock off's and direct to video/DVD dross. Ridley Scott's 'Alien' is arguably one of the most notorious sci-fi chillers out there. Now I know It's very easy to jump on the bandwagon and call select movies a classic and given It's high rating here on IMDb. I could be insecure enough to believe that there is something sorely wrong with my personal taste in movies. But to be quite frank I've never been able to appreciate what it is about 'Alien' that so many other fans adore. Indeed It's exceedingly well directed and the set design, production values are mesmerising and the Alien is the pinnacle of inspired, visual terror. But while it Carred the tag line ""In space no-one can hear you scream"". A more fitting one should have been ""In space no-one can hear you yawn"". So why did I find this picture to be such a monumental bore? Well, while the movies plotting is a simplistic and It does deliver what must have been a genuinely ingenious 'shock' about a third or so in to the movie. It's the picture's precision, lengthy slow pacing. A gimmick you could label it I suppose. Utilised to crank up the tension as the crew members of the mining ship Nostromo. Comprising of a cast of talented character actors answering a distress call from what appears to be a derelict vessel on a near by planet. Among the cast are the now legendary Sigourney Weaver as the heroic, feisty Ellen Ripley who would go on to star in the movies three sequels (Alien's bearing the distinction of being the only decent outing). And Tom Skerrit as Dallas who sadly didn't quite have the same success as his female co-star. But is arguably best remembered for his career defining performances in ""Steel Magnolias"" and and the deceptively cosy mid-nineties television drama series ""Picket Fences"".<br/><br/>When one of the crew Kane (The excellent John Hurt) descends in to a chamber within the enigmatic space craft. He soon emerges from within. With an arachnid like creature locked firmly to his face. Once back on the Nostromo. Attempts are made to surgically detach the beast but to no avail. As doing so would result in Kane's death. When the creature, unseen by the other crew members relinquishes It's all too powerful grip on the incapacitated member of the crew and It is revealed to have mysteriously died. All seems to be well. Paticualrly when Kane awakens from his short lived coma. But he or anyone else are prepared for what is yet to come.<br/><br/>It all sounds very well and good. And as said before, on paper this did have the potential makings for what could have been a tremendous exercise in nail biting terror. But with It's lengthy exposition, and all too heavy reliance on building up tension rather than relying on more confrontational encounters with the menacing Alien of the title. It fails to really be the roller coaster ride of emotion and fear that the imperfect but superior follow up 'Aliens' (1986) managed to be thanks to James Cammeron's talents as an action/sci-fi director and screen writer.<br/><br/>And while there is the odd flourish of inspired creativity which include an eerie crawl through a labyrinth of air vents as the Alien slowly but surely hunts down It's prey, an ingenious twist which would be expanded upon in the movies sequels and a final ""surprise confrontation"". It's never quite enough to compensate for the abysmal, tiresome monotony.<br/><br/>I'm sure I'm not alone in my thinking as I write this review and although I'm not alone in that thinking I'll have to belong to the tiny few who fails to comprehend what makes this such an iconic, cult treasure. Each to their own I say. But just let me say this. At least it also featured the brilliant Ian Holm as the cool minded, thoughtful scientist Ash. Another fine actor that this film probably didn't deserve."

","This film may be a classic to most people, but to me it's just another sci-fi flick that doesn't quite shine over other classics, like Planet of the Apes or Star Wars, which were released around that time and with less budget, and way better special effects, WAY better. The part where they exchange the robot head for the human one, was a total laugh. Also, watching it in 2012 and noticing the poorly done effects definitely lowers the vote. If you watch Star Wars, for example, today, you still can be amazed by those incredible special effects, done around the same time (1977) and with less money. So, I think the poor special effects are one of the reasons for this film to be not so great, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The idea is great: to encounter an alien form on a deserted planet was not something very common back in 1979 like it is nowadays. It was original and scary. That idea, combined with the suspense atmosphere and the large set designs, provided some good amount of expectation about what's coming next. Sadly, the expectation on the first moments, turned into frustration around half of the movie: nothing happened until the last 20 minutes, so it made the first 90 way too long, and way too boring.<br/><br/>The characters are stupid, specially Lambert, who I really, really hate. I didn't get to care for any of these people, so when they die I'm just glad because something's finally happening in this movie.<br/><br/>There are a lot of plot holes. For one, if you're going to make an ""emergency"" detonation system, try to make it fast and simple. The idea for ""emergency"" is that you have no time for pulling two heavy levers, opening a large chest, reading what you have to do, putting a code, inserting FOUR cylindrical things into holes, opening each one of them and pressing a button. Oh, and then you have to run like 2 miles of corridors to get to the shuttle. But, what if you change your mind? Easy, go back and deactivate the ""emergency"" system by doing all of the described above in reverse. But, you only have 5 minutes to do it. That's completely ridiculous.<br/><br/>Another thing that I disliked, was the fact that while an alien is trying to kill them all, instead of preparing the shuttle to get the hell out of there, Ripley goes off looking for a CAT. Yes, a cat!<br/><br/>Bottom line: average movie, boring and long at first just to be a big disappointment in the end. My vote: 4/10."

","The only ""Alien"" related movie I had seen before this was ""Alien vs. Predator"" and it had terrible acting, a bad storyline, and the times when we actually see the creatures in their element are limited at best.<br/><br/>When I sat down to watch this epic movie that started it all, I thought this was going to be next to perfection. Either my expectations were too high or it doesn't live up to it's hype.<br/><br/>Pros: - the casting is great and the actors and actresses do well with what their given. - for the time period, the special effects and filming certain sequences were brilliantly done. - when the movie actually picks up, it does live up to it's hype as the sci-fi/horror thriller that was so influential.<br/><br/>Cons: - Ridley Scott focuses on landscape shots and scenes that don't really benefit the movie at all. I would say a good 40 minutes or more of this could've been scrapped. - By wasting film with these scenes that drag on and on with no purpose, the basis of the movie is more blurred and unfocused. - *SPOILER* When the creature finally gets on board and starts it's havoc, the movie becomes interesting. Instead of focusing on storyline and the thrill of hunting the alien, it seems like the writers and Ridley Scott were trying to more focused on pointless visual film sequences.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people defend this movie by saying that it's a different kind of movie than Aliens or Alien 3, but I personally think this could've been executed better and I hope someday that they re-make this properly.<br/><br/>This movie loses a star because of it's very bold ""cons"" but at the same time, it really IS a movie you should watch at least once to form your own opinion."

Rather than waiting for something to happen, while on the edge of our seats, we wait and wait and wait and wait. We barely get to see the alien and the special effects are pretty poor.

","In space, no one can hear you yawn.<br/><br/>The first Ridley Scott film I saw was The Duelists. LOVED it! So I had high hopes for Alien. I saw it when it came out in 1979. Admittedly, the film had a disadvantage before the credits rolled: I saw it in Hollywood and the line for the film was far scarier than the film could possibly be.<br/><br/>As I sat watching it, it seemed familiar, like a film that really freaked me out as a boy: It! The Terror from Beyond Space. ITTFBS had a monster that just couldn't be killed and it was on a ship in space so there was NO escaping it (none of these fruity escape pods in 50s sci-fi). I haven't seen ITTFBS since, but it ranked right up there with Mars Attacks bubble gum cards for giving me the creeps.<br/><br/>So Alien was a remake. There's no crime against that, unless it ends up being the film Alien turned out to be: not very scary, pretty funny (for the wrong reasons) in spots, and politically correct (the enemy isn't so much the Alien as BIG BUSINESS that wants the Alien brought back no matter what the cost). I haven't seen the complete film again for several years, but as it was on today and I found so many parts so ludicrous, I had to vent.<br/><br/>First, a plus: the sequence leading up to the face hugger eggs was, if sluggish, rather intriguing (why do space-age cameras of the future take such bad pictures?) and the sets were great! But we are introduced early on to the film's unending and uninteresting mumbled dialog. I guess this was supposed to make the film seem more `real.' They were improvising some of this, but it might as well have been `caterpillar watermelon' crowd-scene improvising. This got old fast.<br/><br/>The stomach bursting was a shock! But that quickly faded as the Alienette looks like little more than a nasty finger puppet and literally zips off screen WB-cartoon style. It gets worse. After a fight to the death involving a rolled-up issue of Evil Android Monthly, Ash's head comes off. A few minutes of poking a prosthetic mock-up of Ash's head which looks NOTHING like the actual Ash, there is a clumsy cut to actor Holm's head poking through a hole in a table. Meant to be gory and gruseome, this is all just inept. And the gurgle/burble white ooze everywhere made me chuckle -- it looked like someone was having a Dairy Queen nightmare.<br/><br/>Before Ash, the only enunciator in the bunch, is sent to that big milk carton in the sky, he tells us the Alien can't be killed and that the crew is expendable. Daft! How can one transport something that can't be killed which, if it decides it wants to kill you (and everybody else, which seems to be its ""thing""),  can't be transported? Well, that's just the way those big, evil corporations work, I guess. I'll bet the same people behind Wendy's and Swatch are planning something just like this right now! In space, nothing makes much sense!<br/><br/>And speaking of that tag line, I had hoped that this would be a scary, `real' tech movie, following in the footsteps of 2001. No. Sadly, in space, everyone can hear you scream, and mumble, and just make a TON of noise (especially Lambert and Parker throwing those cylinders around; they were probably killed because the Alien couldn't sleep!). And when did steam become a high-tech necessity. Is it DRY in space and they need a nuclear humidifier on every deck; a leaky one, at that?<br/><br/>The last ten minutes are fairly tense: will Ripley slip into something even more comfortable than skin-tight t-shirt and panties before confronting the Alien which is no longer fast and dangerous in the confines of the escape pod, but stumbles around in the ubiquitous steam until it can be ejected like a drunk who's stayed past closing time?<br/><br/>There. I feel better now."

","At 12 years old, my father handed me the book version of Alien, by Alan Dean Foster. I remember him chuckling and telling me I'd like it. Once I started reading, I became absorbed by it. My father was right. This was the year the film was released, and at 12, there was no way of going to see it. So I became obsessed with getting to see it. After the film was released, I stumbled upon the photo book The Making Of Alien, and after finally seeing H.R. Giger's creations, I was completely blown away.<br/><br/>Alien is a tightrope of tension and fear. It's the most atmospheric movie I have ever seen. All of the cast are solid in their roles. Ridley Scott and crew did an amazing job of recreating H.R.Giger's designs, and Scott's direction is flawless throughout. The set designs inside the Nostromo, and the gritty 'space truckers' feel of the film, add to the realism. Which makes for a great contrast when they finally discover the alien derelict, with it's nasty surprises.<br/><br/>John Williams's score is amazing. Suitably dark and bleak, with just a glimmer of hope.<br/><br/>So, from a 12 year old's crush, and to finally seeing it a few years later, I can say with ease, Alien is without doubt, my favourite film.<br/><br/>Total perfection."
"Dutch90","9","3","5","2 April 2018"," The Ultimate Sci-Fi Horror Classic
","The wave of horror films from the 70s and 80s was filled with what many would consider classics. Halloween, Hellraiser, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are all entrenched in the public consciousness and a must see for any film fanatic. But few of these, even the really good ones, rise above the level of 'cult' classic - they have a dedicated fan following and are certainly good films in their own right, but never really rise above their genre. Needless to say, the *true* horror classics hail from the black and white era of the 30s, 40s and 50s, but I'm specifically referring to the 70s/80s wave here. In my book, three of those rose above the level of cult classic, to become true film classics - The Thing, The Excorcist and Alien. And Alien is the one to rule them all.<br/><br/>In many ways, Alien is the base on which every sci-fi horror film of the past forty years was built. Every film made in this genre, no matter how innovative in other areas, rips off Alien in *some* way at least. From the unique design, courtesy of the late H.R. Giger, to the bleak and pessimistic future set design - even more so than the grimy 'used future' and interstellar warfare of Star Wars, Alien is the true antithesis to the giddy optimism of Star Trek - and the greedy corporation trying to exploit the beast at the expense of the characters, and humanity at large. Watching it now, it may seem like you've seen all this before - but that's only because so many others learned it from Alien.<br/><br/>Story-wise, Alien is not much to look at. Though innovative at the time, it is a very basic 'space-explorers-encounter-a-deadly-organism' tale that we've become familiar with by now. The brilliance lies in the execution - Jerry Goldsmith's creepy score, Ridley Scott's slow, atmospheric direction and the authenticity of the characters. Alien's characters aren't particularly developed, but engaging all the same. We get to know them not through deep backstories or dramatic character arcs, but their interactions - including several improvised scenes - which showcase them as relatable, working class everymen. These aren't the mystic heroes of Star Wars on a quest to save the galaxy, or the elite Starfleet captains commanding a ship exploring the vast reaches of space - these are your everyday working stiffs, sent out to the middle of nowhere on a gig. Space holds no enthralling mystery to them - it's their working environment, much like sailors out at sea. And when they encounter a dilapidated alien vessel on a barren planet, there is none of the exciting mystery of many space exploration tales - rather, there is a sense of impending doom. And we see their very human reactions when they encounter this fearsome extraterrestrial predator - fear, anger and desperation. This is not the childlike wonder of first contact, but the terror of being trapped in a tin can with an animal trying to eat you. As icing to the cake, there is no real 'hero' to the story. Ellen Ripley, played brilliantly by Sigourney Weaver - by now synonymous with the Alien franchise - does not emerge as a 'natural leader' among the group. In fact, she doesn't really lead at all - she becomes the story's sole survivor mainly through happenstance, because she is fortunate enough to not be in the wrong place when the Alien comes out, and spends enough time studying it to figure out a way to outsmart it. Later films elevated Ripley to a more mythical status as the woman who kept surviving the Alien incursions, taking away from her human vulnerability in this film.<br/><br/>None of this would be as effective without the film's briljant creature design and special effects. Making the most of its modest budget (reportedly, Ridley Scott built the Space Jockey set without full permission from the studio) and using SFX both sparingly and effectively, Alien has managed to stand the test of time much better than its 1986 sequel Aliens. H.R. Giger's creepy, sexually charged design - inspired both by outlandish fetishes and deep phobias of rape - has not been matched in the decades after, though many have tried. This isn't a cheesy green space invader with a laser gun, but an *animal* - a fierce creature, trying to feed, survive and procreate. The humans it encounters are no mortal enemies or puny natives to be conquered, but either prey or merely in the way. In fact, it isn't really an evil monster - it's just doing what it does to survive. This, in fact, makes it a more effective antagonist rather than if it were just your average creepy space man. Later films respected this core foundation, but unfortunately moved away from the ilusive, deceptive nature of the Alien and turned into insectoid cannon fodder, dangerous mainly because of its large numbers. It's easy to forget that, at its core, Alien is supposed to be about suspense instead of action. <br/><br/>No film, both within the series and outside it, has ever matched the briljant effectiveness of Alien. It is a film that was never meant to be A-list, but became so anyway because it was just executed so well. This is truly one for the ages, and a must-watch even if sci-fi and horror don't appeal to you."
"elijahbutler-40119","10","3","5","19 February 2018"," One of the GREATEST movies of all time!
","I remember when I first saw Alien as a teenager. This movie scared me to the core and it's STILL scary and very suspenseful to this very day! I love movies from all genres and horror is one of my favorite genres in cinema history and when it comes to horror movies, Alien is DEFINITELY one of the greatest ones of all time! Ridley Scott's direction in Alien has a HIGHLY suspenseful feel throughout the entire film and it somewhat makes you feel disturbed and uncomfortable and that's one of the reasons why this film is so iconic! Sigourney Weaver as Ripley takes this ENTIRE film from opening to finish! She was EXCELLENT in this film and this is definitely one of the greatest roles I've seen in ANY movie which makes this one of the greatest roles in cinema history! All of the other characters such as Brett, Parker, Kane, Dallas, Ash and Lambert played by Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, and Veronica Cartwright were really interesting and engaging characters throughout the entire run time of the film and the acting in Alien is ABSOLUTELY mind-blowing which was another reason on why this movie is insanely scary! Now let's talk about the creature in Alien known as The Xenomorph, this thing is just.................ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING AND AWESOME! The Xenomorph has to be one of the scariest things I've ever seen in ANY movie in my entire life! Ridley Scott also decided to not show this creature for the majority of the film which was a little more terrifying, because you never really expect or know when this thing is going to come or what it's going to do to the crew or what the creature looks like when you first watch Alien and it is just GENIUS AND FANTASTIC SUSPENSE FILM-MAKING! Something else that I also love about Alien is of course the iconic chest burst scene! Most of you who have seen Alien know what I'm talking about, but when they were shooting the chest burst scene, the actors were 100% unaware of what was going to come out of John Hurt's chest so when the Xenomorph burst out of his chest, their reactions were legit and real and that's just so awesome! This movie also holds one of the GREATEST jumpscares in cinema history when Dallas is in the air shafts and out of NOWHERE he runs into the Xenomorph and you don't actually see him die by it, but you see it appear and you just hear this EXTREMELY LOUD screeching sound and static sounds in the background and every time I watch this movie, that jumpscare STILL sends chills down my spine and it's a jumpscare done right! There's also something else I absolutely love about Alien when the crew finds out that Ash was a robot that was sent by the company to send this life form back to earth and it is a VERY clever twist that was HIGHLY unexpected and it's all done by the genius mind of Scott and the tension he brings in this film! Alien is one of my all time favorite movies and it has stood the test of time VERY SUCCESSFULLY and it has inspired many film-makers and it will continue to do that, because it's a timeless masterpiece and a classic film and Alien DEFINITELY gets a 10/10!"

","One of the most original, suspenseful & terrifying films you're ever going to come across, Ridley Scott's breakthrough feature is a masterful blend of imagination, art direction, set design, special effects, unsettling score, perfect cast, terrific performances & quality narration, and is an extraordinary achievement in the genre of both horror & science-fiction which today is universally hailed as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time.<br/><br/>Alien follows a seven members crew en-route to Earth on board a huge commercial ship when their journey is interrupted by what appears to be a distress signal from a desolate planet. The crew lands to investigate but discovers a deadly life form which breeds within a human host. And so begins the horror... the horror of a highly aggressive extra-terrestrial creature which begins to stalk & kill them one by one.<br/><br/>Ingeniously directed by Ridley Scott, it's his brilliant use of atmospheric visuals & breathtaking details plus strong emphasis on realism over movie heroics that provides Alien an ageless appeal. Cleverly penned down by Dan O'Bannon, his vision of the monster and the futuristic world he sets the plot in is nothing short of breathtaking. Also, H.R. Giger's design of the monster is an exceptional feat in itself, for it is truly a unique & original fusion of insect, man & machine.<br/><br/>Cinematography & editing is carried out amazingly well and integrates effortlessly with other aspects of this film. The cast works together as a team with great maturity and it was pleasing to see each & every character getting equal importance as it provided viewers a bunch of very believable & convincing individuals. And in a cast that comprises of Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm & John Hurt, it is Weaver who ends up leaving the most lasting impression on the canvas.<br/><br/>But the most remarkable thing about Alien is its persistent attention on suspense over mindless gore & graphic kills and of course, its smart pacing as well that separates it from typical slasher films. Alien actually takes its time & waits until the viewers are fully immersed into its world and is at its scariest when nothing is happening as Scott allows plenty of space for our imaginations to run wild and, with little help from Jerry Goldsmith's tense score, turns almost every frame into a potential nightmare scenario.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, by bringing together the silence of 2001: A Space Odyssey to create suspense and the horror of Jaws by not showing but not ruling out the presence of the creature either, Alien succeeds in creating a very dark, moody & unique atmosphere that constantly provides a feeling of uneasiness throughout its runtime. A genre-defining masterpiece, a genuine fright classic, and an unprecedented fusion of art, science & horror, Alien is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies.

And the design by H.R. Geiger is nothing short of spectacular and really works so nice on the screen. The design is scary, disturbing and fascinating at the same time.<br/><br/>While the creature is very interesting, then director Ridley Scott did a good job at not over-exposing it on the screen. And that really helped to build up the suspense and the dread that permeates the movie.<br/><br/>If you are not already familiar with this 1979 Sci-Fi horror classic, then it is about due time that you take the time to sit down and watch it, because it is the grand introduction to a great franchise."
"Bijan_Karim","8","3","5","1 November 2015"," Perhaps the most competently made horror film ever
","There has always been one big debate with Alien. Is it a horror film, or is it a science fiction film? The answer to me is simple, it is both. Although, I do believe that it is primarily a horror film. Barry Keith has said that the distinguishing factor between science fiction and horror is that ""The appeal of science fiction is primarily cognitive, while horroris essentially emotional."" The reason that I think of Alien as a horror film, is that all of the science in it is there to instil an emotional reaction, specifically the emotion of terror. The production design, art direction, make-up, writing, all rely heavily on science fiction ideals and visuals. However, all of these ideas and visuals are presented in a way to scare the audience. The large spaceship with its dark, narrow corridors serves the purpose of a massive, claustrophobic haunted house. The alien is designed to play on the audience's fears. Even the android character is primarily used for scares, as even he takes the place of a villain from a slasher film in the second half of, similar to the alien. If the film were primarily science fiction, all of the inventions and futuristic elements would primarily be in presented to cognitively affect the viewers. Though the film does have some science fiction ideas that aren't meant to purely instil horror. However, none of these ideas have the sense of awe or wonder that is usually to be expected from science fiction. The space travellers in the film are miners who see what they do as labor rather than a journey. The idea of a dirty, muddy, industrial look was foreign to space operas and science fiction at the time of the film's release. This is where the film succeeds as pure science fiction. <br/><br/>The fact that Alien is largely a horror film is not a negative at all, as I think it is a great one . As I have mentioned before, I think that film is not the best medium for cognitive art. Books are generally the best as they do not deal with the dimension of time to present their ideas, allowing the viewer to take their own pace in understanding ideals. Alien in many ways encapsulates everything I love about science fiction cinema. The sense of mood created by the locations and cinematography are mesmerizing. Every part of the spaceship feels like its own character, and the superb special effects present them in a perfect manner.<br/><br/>'I also feel that Alien is a good example of using realistic acting in a science fiction film, as opposed to Advantageous. Most of the dialogue scenes feel improvisational, and though the actors have everyday looks and qualities, they do not appear or behave ""plain"", instead they are ordinary, but with character. I personally think that the dinner scene after a crew member has been impregnated by the face-hugger is the best scene in the film. The scene is a perfect example how effects that are not necessarily amazing can be used to amazing effect in combination with great filmmaking. The interactions during the dinner scene, which might be the best scene in the film, feel very mundane and ordinary. It has occurred to me that most of it might had been improvised. Scott brilliantly makes us laugh and take comfort for the first time during this scene before the small alien bursts out of the crew member's chest. We are slowly made to believe that everything may actually be okay with the characters and spend some time with them. When the alien comes out of the crew member's chest, the audience is entirely shocked, and at that point it does not fully matter how good the effect looks, as it was not the effect that made the audience feel something, it was the craftsmanship of the film."
"antonjsw1","Null","3","5","1 September 2015"," An exercise in cool, calculating visceral horror
","Ridley Scott's first mainstream Hollywood film is still fresh and powerful 30+ years after it was first released. The story of a commercial spaceship crew diverted to explore a distant planet as a result of the detection of mysterious signal getting themselves an extremely unwanted visitor and the subsequent horror than ensues makes this a landmark science fiction horror film. A fairly straightforward plot is helped by Scott creating a truly superb visually arresting atmosphere, thanks to great work by production designer Michael Seymour and cinematographer Derek Van Lint. It starts of epic, then transitions to the mundane, before building a growing sense of uneasiness leading to claustrophobic suspense and dread that just keeps building and building until, in the final act it turns into a nerve-wracking horror- thriller as key characters fight for survival. <br/><br/>While Ridley Scott deserves great credit in pulling this all together so well, kudos has also to go to the whole cast for creating a wonderfully naturalistic approach to their roles, and being able to define their characters so uniquely and clearly, even if they are archetypes – Yaphet Kotto as the engineer with a chip on his shoulder regarding the preferential pay that the officers get, who nevertheless when the chips are down does demonstrate heroic qualities; Harry Dean Stanton as the fellow engineer who may have some form of brain damage, possibly brought on by historic substance abuse but knows the mechanics of the ship inside-out; Veronica Cartwright as the ships navigator, who acts as the link to the audience as a professionalism is gradually striped away as she is consumed by fear; Ian Holm as Ash, the enigmatic and quiet science officer who has only just jointed the crew at the start of this journey; John Hurt as the curious, fearless and gung- ho second in command, Tom Skerritt as the level headed, approachable but experienced Captain, and of course Sigourney Weaver (for whom this was her first film in a significant role) as what seems to be the young, less experienced but confident and assertive career-driven up and comer Ripley. The growing tensions between the characters, particularly the way that all the character butt heads with Weaver's character works well in the development of the story, and despite relative inexperience Weaver is terrific in the role, and helped create an iconic character in science fiction that would lead to three sequels. <br/><br/>Kudos also has to go to the technical crew for creating a terrific atmosphere for the actors to work in – this was helped by Scott deciding to film the movie in chronological order of the story rather than a more typical logistical shooting order. The decision to hire the dark surreal artist HR Giger certainly brought a fresh new look to science fiction, but Michael Seymour's production design is truly brilliant and the way that the Alien is presented on screen is still pretty much the best – keeping its appearances limited and quick – nerves are so shredded by the end of the movie that seeing the monster in more extended full body shots where it is more obvious that it's a man in suit doesn't pull you out of the picture. Credit has also got to go to the brilliant Oscar winning visual effects team – as well as the aforementioned HR Giger, it also included in-camera effects from both Nick Alder and Brian Johnson, and excellent miniature photography from Dennis Ayling. Alder had cut his teeth as a director of effects photography on the Gerry Anderson TV show 'Space 1999'. After Alien, he has worked as an on-set special effects expert on an array of films including Empire Strikes Back, Conan the Barbarian(1982 version), Legend, Jewel of the Nile, Leon, Braveheart, Lost in Space, Behind Enemy Lines, Blade 2, Underworld, Hellboy, Shanghai Knights, Ghost Rider, and would win a BAFTA for best visual effects for the Luc Besson film The 5th Element. Johnson's early credits including work as a special effects assistant on 2001, before also cutting his teeth on Space 1999 as a 2nd unit director overseeing the visual effects. After Alien he would work on a variety of films including Never-ending Story, Dragonslayer, Slipstream, Dragonheart as well as winning another Oscar for best visual effects for Empire Strikes Back and a BAFTA for his work on Aliens. Carlo Rimbaldi was already an Oscar winning special effects veteran of over 20 films prior to working on Alien, and had just prior to this film completed work on both King Kong (for which he had won his prior Oscar) and Close Encounters. He would go on to win a third academy award for his work on E.T, and would go onto work on Conan the Destroyer and Dune. Denis Ayling followed this film as a cinematographer in British Television. Giger's did occasionally work on other films (creature designer on Alien 3, visual designer on Species) but his legacy is that the basic Alien look and design influence has survived through 3 excellent to OK Alien sequels, two poor Alien v Predator crossover movies, two disappointing Alien prequels, a batch of (very bad) Species sequels. <br/><br/>Another noticeable contributor to the film's mood was the music – which should have been credited to Ridley Scott and Editor Terry Rawlings. Jerry Goldsmith's original score was extensively edited, cues moved around and classic music from other compositions fitted into the scores, but nevertheless somehow the music works very well. <br/><br/>All of this helped make Alien a truly outstanding movie. The atmosphere created is so visceral that the film always leaves you with an impact after when the film is over<br/><br/>Overall a landmark science-fiction classic."

The alien is genuinely frightening and biologically convincing, when it could easily have looked absurd. The plot is simple, perfectly so. The cast are great - particularly Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm.<br/><br/>The real mark of genius, though, is the way the characters get picked off one - by one - by one. It keeps you guessing, and right to the death it's not obvious who will be the last survivor, or even if there will be a last survivor. <br/><br/>Downsides? The special effects are, unsurprisingly, ageing. Mostly this is covered up by the fact that we're deliberately only given brief glimpses of the alien. But occasionally the facade slips. For example, there's a scene right at the end where the alien is on the outside of a space-craft and looks like it's being carried around on a piece of string.<br/><br/>But special effects will always age and that can be forgiven. It doesn't detract from a movie that fully achieves what it sets out do - keep you enthralled and on the edge of your seat the whole way through."

","This movie is amazing and wonderful, I had a feeling that when I went into this movie I wouldn't feel so scared. Because it came from 1979, but was I wrong. This movie was an amazing thriller and suspenseful film. It felt like I was really in space, but also all alone and running from something that I didn't know. I felt like every moment was suspenseful as the last moment. That every thing led to another. <br/><br/>Aliens a movie that shows that curiosity just doesn't kill the cat it also kills us. That being all alone in a spaceship isn't all cracked up as it seems. That even for a 1979 movie it can still scare the crap out of you.

","Deep in space, the commercial vessel the Nostromo receives an emergency distress signal from an unexplored planet. After having arrived and conducted a search for survivors the crew returns home only to discover in the most terrifying of ways that a deadly and seemingly invincible bio-form has joined them, and is slowly hunting them one by one.<br/><br/>Terrifyingly claustrophobic is a brilliant way to describe this movie. The tension escalates as the movie plays its course. The pacing is brilliant from master filmmaker Ridley Scott. Sigourney Weaver in her most iconic role does a brilliant job portraying Ripley. The feeling of being closed off, the feeling of the Nostromo being a giant claustrophobic maze in which the viewer desperately wishes to escape make this one of the greatest and most terrifying films of its generation. With shocking surprises and twists throughout including the iconic dinner scene that still to this day can be shocking for a first time viewer. The score of the fim only adds to the tension and seemingly silent but deadly tension that continues to mount as the film plays on, only at its conclusion does the viewer finally feel as though they may take a deep breath. Spawning 3 sequels, 2 cross over films, and a loosely tied prequel, Alien has proved to not only resonate these many years later but maintain its popularity within the mytho's of classic American cinema."

"ritera1","Null","3","5","25 June 2012"," This guy should have directed Prometheus
","What? It's the same guy? Can't be! The only reason I went back to Alien is 'cause I just saw Prometheus. You know. The one that is supposedly not a prequel to Alien but is nothing but that.<br/><br/>I think the problem with Ridley Scott is that he was able to get his teeth into the script process in his latter films. I would have to imagine that he was controlled and was far away from the screenplay for Alien, since this is far better than Prometheus.<br/><br/>Unlike the latter, I liked and was invested in the characters of Alien. I couldn't figure out why 'cause the presentation of such was so similar. Then I realized that it was 'cause they were workin' class people. The title card says it's a mining vessel. My mind then made the connection due to real life and past caricatures. Then the quality acting helped, too.<br/><br/>And characters were the main problem in Prometheus. Ill-defined and vague. I didn't care. (The mohawk guy was portrayed as a no-nonsense in-it-for-the-money guy. That's the blueprints for a mercenary or gun for hire. Not a geologist.) I miss the sci-fi of the 70s and 80s. Sure, the computer graphics were silly compared to today. Along with all the blinking lights that obviously had no purpose. But the models had dimension and the shooting style had grit. And story was king.<br/><br/>The best part of Alien is that it could breath. Slow and steady but it all had a purpose and was interesting. But then dozens and dozens of horror movies took that as ""kill time for 45-minutes and then start the movie"".<br/><br/>Then someone thought they could second-guess the process and invited the marketing guys to the table. What a bad decision!"
"classicsoncall","9","3","5","28 January 2009"," ""What's the story Mother?""
","For me, ""Alien"" was one of the seminal films of the Seventies that had a way of reinventing a genre, much in the way ""Star Wars"" did for sci-fi fantasy or ""The Exorcist"" did for horror. Sci-fi horror was treated to something new and different here, with scenes and concepts that were truly unique that hadn't been done before. I still think back to the time I saw the picture during it's original theatrical release, and marvel at the idea of the chest-burster for example. And I can't tell you how much the scene with Ash (Ian Holm) that revealed his robotic form blew me completely away; it was almost too difficult to concentrate on the rest of the story. Then there was the title character itself, a creature assuming horrific proportions through the same process of metamorphosis that transforms caterpillars into butterflies, but here done with complete disregard for the norms of natural evolutionary process.<br/><br/>What's striking in watching the film today is how both timely and timeless it is. Timely in that as a product of the Seventies, the set design seems almost minimalist, to the degree that sci-fi films of the 1940's and '50's were dated to reflect the technology of those periods. Timeless however in the constructs that work to achieve their intended effect in the mind of the viewer, a fear of the unknown and a fascination with fantastical creatures that have a right to exist only in our imagination. Something as simple as Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) picking up the reptilian shed skin of the chest burster claws away at one's mind, forcing the viewer to consider what might be in store for the survivors of this mission. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, I haven't seen any comments on the role of the spaceship on this board. There was a point in the movie when it began to emerge that the Nostromo itself became a hostile entity to the crew. 'Mother' herself appeared to have, in the words of many a 'Star Trek' episode, a prime directive of it's own, that of investigating and securing alien life forms. Was there a more chilling moment in the story than the words Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) read as Mother's response to her question about the nature of of Nostromo's programming? - ""Crew Expendable"". <br/><br/>So it's thirty years since the release of ""Alien"", and the film is just as fascinating to watch today as it was that long ago. Granted, some of the early going is a bit slow in the delivery, but as a set up to what follows it's a wait that's made worthwhile for the suspense that builds and reaches a crescendo in the second half. I'll take this one head and shoulders over any number of present day efforts that attempt to dazzle the audience with over the top action and mind blowing special effects, each successive effort attempting to outdo the one that came before. With ""Alien"" you have the real deal, a story and a creation that stands the test of time to emerge as an icon of popular movie and cultural entertainment."
"gavin6942","9","3","5","28 August 2007"," A Classic in Both Horror and Sci-Fi Genres
","After landing on a planet to perform a rescue, a group of military excavators find an alien life form that isn't exactly friendly. Face hugging, chest popping and outright carnage ensue, as one by one the crew is left to fend for themselves.<br/><br/>This film goes down as a classic, and it well should have. A giant in the sci-fi world directed this (Ridley Scott, ""Blade Runner"") and it was written by Dan O'Bannon (who also adapted ""Total Recall"" from Philip K. Dick and wrote/directed the horror classic ""Return of the Living Dead""). And a cast consisting of Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm? Amazing! <br/><br/>What makes this film great is the real sense of being alone it leaves you with. Even when the crew is grouped together, they know they're trapped millions of miles from home. They must fight to survive, no running possible. The enemy changes and remains unknown, and even one of the crew may not be on their side.<br/><br/>This film contains the iconic ""chest-popping scene"", which was pretty cool. Granted, after seeing ""Spaceballs"" you might be let down by the version in this movie, but it's still pretty memorable. The face-huggers are also creepy, if you can imagine what that must be like to have a slimy, acid-blooded creature suctioned on your face, dropping eggs. Nasty! The film goes from sci-fi to horror and back again, mixing the two together in way that's rarely successful (although I would give a nod to ""Event Horizon"" for being a fine exception). <br/><br/>They implement the ""final girl"" scenario well. I don't mean to ruin the plot for anyone, but not many of the crew survive and one of them is Sigourney Weaver (which I suppose is obvious since she's in all the sequels). She knows how to be tough, even if she's not exactly pretty while doing it. (I think horror fans crave attractive women more than science fiction fans do, if this film is any evidence.) <br/><br/>My only complaint with this film is the alien suit, which seemed too rubbery and human-like. Luckily, the director was smart and saved the reveal until much later in the movie and kept it to a minimum. Sometimes the unseen is scarier than the seen, especially if you aren't able to make the monster as scary as you planned (which is fixed in future sequels).<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this one, see it. It sets the bar for all future science fiction films, particularly ones involving hostile alien life. I don't know if a film in the genre can be made any more without somehow paying their respects to this one."

This is a patient horror film, that will never be touched. Anyone who says it is overrated is in my opinion an ignorant snob trying to start fights for no reason. There is no way this film is overrated, there is nothing else like it and it will never be duplicated even though everything after it has tried. How can this movie be overrated when it set the standard for Sci/Fi horror? Name one movie that came after ALIEN that either took place in space or involved creatures from outer space that didn't in some way rip it off? I pity the poor bastard who forgets history and has spit on classic and original films just to make a name for themselves. Alien is not overrated, and anyone says so will only end up exposing themselves as an ignorant fraud who knows nothing of greatness. It is easy to arrogantly claim that this film is overrated, and there will be many more cynical bitter fools to follow, but none of them will ever in their entire lives be anything more than an ignorant snob pissing on greatness just to be heard.

","Probably the first sci-fi/horror, and definitely the best. By limiting the number of characters, and enclosing them in a confined space, Scott hikes up the tension without having to resort to cheap thrills or buckets of gore (though the chest-bursting scene is still terrifyingly effective). Each of the characters is fairly well developed, and it's unclear at the start who will live and who will not, which also upps the suspense. The production design is really cool, and doesn't look dated at all, and the alien creature itself is quite original and still scary.

"MovieAddict2016","10","5","11","31 October 2003"," Director's Cut Review...
","Minor Spoilers<br/><br/>I attended a screening of ""Alien: The Director's Cut"" not four hours ago, and not four hours ago I was thrilled. I knew that I was going to get a chance to witness one of the most atmospheric and thrilling films of all time--with added footage. Fans who picked up the DVD (now out of print to make way for the new ""Alien Quadrilogy"") may have already seen a few of the deleted segments, while other fans who didn't, and are waiting on the promised quadrilogy to be released next year, will be enthralled. This film doesn't feature a wealth of new footage such as ""Apocalypse Now Redux,"" scenes that could damage its flow, but instead gives us scenes that click together a bit more. One of these is when Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) finds Dallas (Tom Skerritt) attached to the wall with alien mucus seen later in ""Aliens."" It doesn't make sense to feature it in the original cut, and director Ridley Scott was smart for deleting it when the film hit theaters back in 1979. It doesn't really make much sense, and stops the gripping flow of the ending when Ripley is racing to get to the escape shuttle. It causes people to think, What? and then they start letting their minds wander. But now that we have seen ""Aliens,"" and understand the significance of the mucus (sounds funny, huh?), it makes complete sense. This is the fan's version.<br/><br/>Plus, it's fun to get to see the movie on the big screen for those who didn't twenty-four years ago.<br/><br/>The plot (as if you didn't know it by now): A mining ship in the future named the Nostromo, carrying seven passengers back to earth, stops in its course to locate an SOS beacon on a distant planet, which may, or may not, actually be a warning signal as opposed to a distress beacon--too late to find out, since they land on the planet and one of the investigating crew members, Kane (John Hurt), gets attacked by a strange alien creature that attaches itself to his face and doesn't let go.<br/><br/>The ship's captain, Dallas, hauls him into the ship's lab, where he is looked over by the ship's scientist, Ash (Ian Holm), who takes an odd affection to the creature that bothers Ripley, the second in command. The technician, Parker (Yaphet Kotto), doesn't like any of this either, and their suspicions reach a maximum when Kane wakes up from his sleep, the alien unattached from his face, and proceeds to eat irregularly. Later that night, back in their course to earth, a small alien bursts from Kane's stomach at dinner. The alien escapes into the depths of the ship. Search parties commence but the alien starts to grow more fierce and terrifying as the film treads on--soon it's a man-eating set of teeth bent on killing the lot of them.<br/><br/>Atmosphere is part of what makes ""Alien"" the terrifying nail-biter it is. This isn't a routine horror flick that jumps through all the hoops--it's original to a certain degree. Its inspiration comes from earlier films but it improves upon them all for the most part. From its opening shots to its final, it is eerie, moody, and scary. To show millions of aliens abounding from hidden crevices would be typical--the fear of ""Alien"" lies in the anticipation of the jump, or the startle. We wait, and wait, and suddenly something leaps at the screen. It's not the alien. The alien is in front of the thing that jumped. Our heart stops and then jolts again. Forget pumping volts of electricity through dead people--place them in front of this and their hearts will pound once again.<br/><br/>James Cameron's sequel ""Aliens"" (1986) is often considered the better of the series, in terms of excitement and aliens themselves. But ""Alien,"" like the movie ""Signs"" (2002), isn't really about aliens. The film ""Aliens"" is terrific--but so is ""Alien,"" as its central idea is too unnerve the audience through bumps and jolts. Not through blood and guts. Depends on what your personal preferences are--startles or explosions? I appreciate and enjoy both.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott knows how to evoke wonder and magnificence from his shots. The opening sequence that shows the exterior of the Nostromo and then dissolves to the interior, crawling along the shafts as we wait for something scary to happen and then forget as we are wowed by the movement and visuals, is a fine example of the art of filmmaking and not the filmmaking itself. Cameron is one of my favorite directors. Scott, when given the right material, can turn out wonders. ""Alien"" is his crowning achievement alongside the dark 1982 classic ""Bladerunner,"" another sci-fi feast for the eyes and mind. I wasn't a fan of ""Gladiator,"" but let's not bring that up, shall we?<br/><br/>""Alien"" may seem tame by today's standards. But this isn't a film that wants to be another mindless blood and guts extravaganza. This is a smart horror film, one that is as involving as it visually magnificent, one that is as amazing as it is terrifying. This is horror at its finest. And if you didn't get to see it on the big screen last time around, now is your chance to get a glance at what you've been missing all these years.<br/><br/>Notes: The new ""Alien: Director's Cut"" version features over three minutes of never-before-seen sequences, as well as restored prints and a newly remixed surround-sound track. Attached to the director's release of the film is also the first teaser trailer for next year's ""Alien vs. Predator.""<br/><br/>5/5 stars for the 1979 original and 2003 Director's Cut.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

The movie is directed by Ridley Scott, with a story written by Dan O'Bannon, and Ronald Shusett. The movie stars Tom Skerritt and Sigourney Weaver. A commercial space ship, the Nostromo, is on a return journey when it picks up a distress transmission. The crew of the Nostromo investigates the derelict ship.<br/><br/>Alien is a classic science fiction movie and a classic horror movie. The movie has great pacing across the 117 minutes of running time. The movie has a great lead in Sigourney Weaver playing Ripley. The warrant officer is the audience's anchor to trying to understand and deal with the growing threat of the xenomorph. The entire movie has an interesting universe as the crew of the Nostromo have to fight against the technology and the xenomorph.<br/><br/>The story of Alien is incredibly basic. The crew of the Nostromo simply find an alien derelict ship and then attempt to deal with the extraterrestrial on their own ship. The entire running time is spent with the crew dealing with the monster. In this way the movie is similar to a slasher movie however the movie has science-fiction themes that help elevate the movie to more of a slasher movie. The themes of cosmic horror and greed permeate through this movie. The corporation wanted to obtain the alien even at the cost of the crew's lives. The crew and the corporate android are in over their heads as the alien has the upperhand. The creature could not be controlled and it was not understood. The movie focused on the drama within the crew instead of utilizing them for gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>The creature and the movie is a classic and should be watched for any fans of horror science-fiction.<br/><br/>I would recommend Alien.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"johnboy-22743","9","2","3","19 November 2019"," Disturbing, Oppressive, Horrific. In other words, everything I want from Horror!
","Made in the late '70s, Alien became the prototype for genre films going forward. Before they relied on quick-cuts, jump-scares, and digital effects to create our ""horror"", filmmakers instead used pacing, theme, and a combination of attacks on our senses to keep us constantly dreading what may be around that next corner.<br/><br/>The slower pacing, accentuated by longer takes and establishing shots, allowed the dread to build Because of this, the payoff was very gratifying. Some of this came from technical limitations. For example, they really couldn't show the ""alien"" in its entirety as it moved around simply because it would've looked a bit hokey. Instead, as with Jaws before it, Alien shows us glimpses, suggestions, reactions, and aftermath. When we do finally see the alien in its full glory, it is indeed glorious.<br/><br/>The filmmakers used the oppressively dark, wet, and mechanical environments to hide the threat in plain sight, forcing the audience to feel a little bit of the helplessness felt by the characters.<br/><br/>The director also tricked the actors into visceral, horrified reactions through sneaky and ambiguous direction coupled with extreme practical effects.<br/><br/>The idea behind this movie could've been done in any isolated, close-quarters environment. The fact that it was an alien on a spaceship simply added to the overall feel and impact of the movie; however, it would've been nearly as effective if set in, say, an Antarctic outpost, or in a submarine, or in an abandoned research lab. Because of this, it sparked a rash of imitators in those exact scenarios (and more).<br/><br/>Alien is a classic horror film. An icon. That said, it just may fail to have the same impact on modern audiences. The slower pacing, deliberate story beats, low-tech effects, and dialogue-heavy scenes would likely be seen as ""boring"", and might risk losing a less mature audience before the big fun even begins. This is a shame, but I doubt many younger horror fans would get as much out of this movie people did when it was first released.<br/><br/>That said, if you want to see where this style of horror reached its zenith, look no further than the xenomorphic sci-fi body-horror of Alien."

","This movie was definitely above your average sci-fi horror movie. It's not just a horror film where the crew of Nostromo is being hunted by an alien just because it just happens to be there.

The Alien not just some scary being because it is strong, but because it is smart and menacing. Although the movie does employ some cheap jumpscares from time to time, it was definitely not overused. Additionally, some of its gore scenes are shot at odd angles making it quite difficult to see what goes on in the screen, although I believe this is mostly due to constraints for relying on mostly practical effects.<br/><br/>Characters in the movie are well written and doesn't treat the audience as stupid. The actions they take make sense. Rather than their fate being tied to how stupid they are, their life depends on how they can outsmart or be outsmarted by the Alien.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the movie serves a provoking and thoughtful take on horror, something that many horror directors of the current age should take in to account.

This film, the arty sci-fi version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, starts with a brooding isolation in space mood then builds nicely when the 'truckers in space' land on a derelict planet to find the source of an alien transmission which may be a warning according to a female crew member. What happens then is that a bizarre alien species with an interesting life cycle then begins to be the hunter and one by one gets each crew member. The film is a first for showing a very visceral graphic violent scene which scared off audience members while making the others sick. The acting is superb. Ian Holm as Ash, is acted amazingly. It's funny in a smart way how much human traits he has in his personality- his deceptive ways, the high-strung and annoyed aspects are so intense and highly reactive that its almost funny in a good way. John Hurt's character is devoted, enthusiastic and meek in comparison. His curiosity gets the best of him however. It's also interesting to note that after 35 years of watching this film that I now see that captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), also annoyed and high strung is actually going along with Ash and his constant bickering reminders that the alien must go back to earth for study despite the company's secret 'Special Orders' in that the alien is of highest priority and that the crew is expendable. The rest of the acting by Yaphet Kotto (cocky alpha brave male), Harry Dean Stanton, his right hand man and parrot (""RIIIIIIGGGGHHT..."" is amusing), Veronica Cartwright (frail and adds fear and tension at her improvised crying helpless scenes (something she does rather well- see her performance as a child in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds) and Sigourney Weaver as the proper ethical company person who takes the cake and balls in the film and innovates to dispose of the beast. The Alien and the planet's topography and Alien derelict ship was designed by Swiss surrealist painter and sculptor H.R. Ginger. No expense was spared- here he created sexually suggestive and ultra creepy aspects to the creature (a mix of organic and mechanical dna) and landscape. The tension builds up so amazingly that you'll find yourself downright baking in fear whilst rooting for the heroine to be to kill the alien or successfully escape. The music by Jerry gold Smith's a winner here...bizarre yet fitting classical ambient with a weird cool depressing down tone compliments the action while translating the story into more atmosphere and fear, rather artistically. This film was a huge success and its trajectory is unforgettable and relentless. This became an ultra huge comercial cult hit and is the best of the franchise it brewed. The vast nature of space, 7 crew members, one ship and one hell of a unique, hostile and clever alien that has Kill on its mind. He director has the audience gripping their seats throughout that the surprise stick he throws at us, the viewers, into the drama's spokes is more than a acceptable and furthers the constant building of relentlessness. It's perfect right down to the end credits' music, which plays out ironically like funeral music and great ending mellow classical fanfare. ALIEN is one of the best films in the past 40 years. It never ages and of course never let's go.<br/><br/>The 4k blu ray's image is a 4 out of 5, as it was transferred around 2013/4 using earlier equipment. I suspect the original 35mm film negative was not used as the film looks like a bit of a well worn faded documentary film. However that's to the analytical eye....the lighting is meant to look that way. The sound is superb, and you can listen to every mix they ever made for it it...from dolby pro logic matrixed mixes to early ac-3 (5.1 surround) for laser discs to a new 7.1 mix. Included are audio commentaries and the cash grab 2003 extended cut. Alien is a masterpiece of psychology , fight for survival while living a nightmare that keeps getting worse."

","40 years after the fact and finally getting around to watching this movie and all I can think is that I wish I'd watched it earlier. The effects, for the most part, hold up very well, the acting is wonderful and the story is creative.<br/><br/>Alien really is a testament to the glory of practical effects, because when the xenomorph jumps out it still looks amazing. Where the effects kinda falter is in the tech. Monitors and keyboards just look old in this.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Alien suffers from something a lot of the greats do. If you're late to see it, 40 years late in this case, the film has so much invaded the pop culture consciousness that without ever seeing it you know some things. And, because it was so impactful, it's also influenced a wide number of things, which is incredible and adds to the significance of the film but makes it hard to watch now without feeling like these are things I've seen before.<br/><br/>Still great movie and definitely worth the watch."

","They don't go any better in Sci-Fi/Horror. Even tho it shows its age --computers, technology, props and costumes- it grabs you like a hook in your belly from the start. Young Sigurney Weaver and Veronica Cartwright provide a high breeze of fresh air in the otherwise oppressive mouldy interiors. It was Ridley Scott at his best, along with other early masterpieces like his much accoladed debut 'The Duellists'. It is one of those films that set landmarks and that you don't tire of watching time and again. You will find yourself longing towards the era when films were created with physical props and costumes instead of present CGI gluttony. One of the true choice films for your top 100."

","The settings in this film are exhilarating and claustrophobic, the characters are funny and likeable and we want them to survive, the creature is horrifying and vile, and the storyline is tense and exciting. This might be the most popular alien franchise ever made (there are more sequels for this than there are for ""Predator""), and that's a well-deserved title. Personally, this is in my top ten science fiction films (and maybe in my top ten horror films as well); it's a movie I'll return to multiple times over the course of my life, and its one I doubt I'll ever grow tired.

"herlidaniel","10","2","3","18 June 2019"," Favorite Horror/Sci-Fi movie
","Alien has something that current horror movies lack and that is fear of the unknown. For a good portion of the movie, we didn't know what the alien looked like. Alien builds up tension by not showing us what the alien looked like or what it was doing.
The characters were amazing during the whole movie. They weren't there just for the alien to kill, they actually had characteristic unique to them. Each character felt real and relatable.
The best part of the movie was definitely the alien. Like I said above the alien was never shown completely without purpose. It was moving with the intention of killing everyone on board.
Ridley Scott direction was excellent. From the atmosphere to how the alien goes on board the ship, everything was on point. I loved the atmosphere of this movie, it was a claustrophobic during most of the movie.
This film is not an action film, so it doesn't have fast sequence moments; this movie takes its time and is a very slow pace. But, that is what makes it work."
"vithiet","9","2","3","9 June 2019"," Classic movie that defined the space sci-fi horror genre
","I've seen this movie many times before but just watched the Director's Cut for the first time. Besides a couple of scenes with very dated special effects, it has aged very well and remains a classic that set up all the rules for this type of movie. Younger generations may think it's a bunch of predictable, overused tropes but they should keep in mind this is the movie that inspired everything else they might have seen!
Having watched the original Blade Runner recently to prepare for Blade Runner 2049, it's also interesting to notice how much of the atmosphere and gritty elements/shots in Alien help mold what would become another genre-defining movie for Ridley Scott."
"maue-19674","10","2","3","16 May 2019"," ALIEN - Ridley Scott's Gothic Masterpiece
","It is quite a few years since I first sat down to watch 'Alien', my anticipations being that it would be like any other Sci-Fi film of the period. To say that this film changed my life may be a slight overstatement but it certainly changed the way I view Film and Cinema! The opening titles (accompanied by Jerry Goldsmith's thoroughly creepy score) give the tone of what is to come. The crew of a commercial star freighter are awakened by their onboard computer as it has picked up a 'signal' from a small planetoid in a nearby system. Obliged by Company Rules to investigate, they set down and find a completely non-human ship crashed and (apparently) derelict. One of the crew descends into the bowels of the ship - to be confronted by a chamber full of ovoid shapes...unwisely he decides to take a closer look...and things spiral out of control from that point....What makes this Film SO great is that it is almost shot in a semi-documentary style - the shaky camera footage on the helmet cams, the dark foreboding atmosphere and the quite slow pace - all are deliberately and slowly drawing the audience in. Alien sometimes comes close to being a 'Science Fiction Art-Film' - and so it is - in a way. The designs are extraordinary - with Swiss Artist H.R. Giger designing the absolutely frightening ALIEN of the title. Scott's visuals are astounding and introduced him to Hollywood as a real talent. The pace picks up through the second half of the film - the effects were all done 'in camera' - no CGI here - just old fashioned film making. Scott ensures you never quite see the creature, which adds to the menace and sense that you are trapped in there with it. The sequence in the air shafts is superb - a gripping piece of cinema, as is Alien's most celebrated scene - the 'birth' of the monster.<br/><br/>We tend to forget now that, back in 1979, it was not the norm to have a 'female hero' - Scott deliberately went and made 'Ripley' a female to set against audience expectations - thus when Captain Dallas falls, the audience were now wondering what to expect. Everything about this production is first rate and Ridley Scott has never really been better (unless you compare with Blade Runner). Sigourney Weaver - a then unknown - shows that strong female leads are the future.
It is difficult to underestimate the impact of this Film on Science Fiction in general - this really WAS the first time that a Sci-Fi Film was shot, designed and delivered in a totally realistic way - which is why audiences believed it and were scared to hell. This Film so impressed me that I started to watch other Genres, older cinema - it gave me the 'gateway' into the history of Film. It will forever be may most treasured cinematic experience...If you have never seen this - prepare to shocked, scared and blown away with some of the most stunning visuals in this Genre."
"jaspermorrisey","10","2","3","12 May 2019"," Alien - An Example In How to Build Tension
","Alien is a film that needs no introduction, it deservedly recreated the Sci-Fi / Horror genre in a significant way, of which the shock waves are still being felt to this day. From the establishing shots alone, Ridley Scott showcases an eerie visual flair that puts the viewer on edge from beginning to end. The empty corridors, heavy shadows and a hauntingly subtle score create an uneasy atmosphere that is almost as intimidating as the creature itself. Speaking of, the Alien creature is a masterpiece in costume design, with an iconic look taken from H.R Giger that still holds up to this day, in part of course due to the excellent lighting that only allows for glimpses of the monster, preying upon the viewer's fear of the unknown. Moreover, the small cast of unfortunate Space Truckers creates a level of grit and realism to the characters as a result of the excellent dialogue and acting. The iconic Chestburster scene alone demonstrates the film's use of shock value, expertly crafted special effects and unrelenting tension to culminate in a hauntingly gruesome scene. In space, no one can hear you scream."

","There are many so-called scary movies, but the scariest ones are those that play out in our mind. Where your imagination completes the picture and your brain delivers the jolt of horror! Alien is one such movie! I saw it first at 15 and was scared out of my wits, and it really was not until my 20s that I could look at the whole movie without goosebumps.<br/><br/>Now, after watching the movie perhaps 100 times, I am still attracted to it and drawn into it. But my perception of it changes. Having seen it today again on TV, I realized the really positive message was that the CAT has survived :) The Nostromo crew is dead and the ship destroyed, a colony would be set up on the planet and destroyed again, Ellen Ripley loses her daughter and ultimately her life, but the Weyaland-Yutani Corporation prospers. Everything sucks except the cat makes it! And that is good :)<br/><br/>Bottom line: Cat 1 - Alien 0"
"TheDragonTrader","Null","2","3","25 April 2019"," For those in love with Space, Terror and Cats
","In a seemingly abandoned spaceship, the silence is interrupted by an incoming signal. An automatic program wakes the crew up from hibernation. Disoriented, they assume they're close to home: earth. But no, they're still only halfway there. The signal that was picked up by the ship comes from an unknown origin on an unknown planet and they, the unprepared crew of a simple cargo ship, must go out to investigate. And nothing can prepare them for what they will encounter...<br/><br/>This slow burn horror masterpiece gives you the chills, even today, and will keep doing it for years to come. It works because of the practical effects, because of the brilliant directing because of the acting, because of the music, because of the set pieces... should I continue?<br/><br/>The futuristic universe 'Alien' takes place in is put before us and is compellingly realistic. With several winks at Kubric's '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) in the design of the ship and the momentary hint of classical music, it creates a sense of familiarity, yet in the ships' largely industrial-gothic appearance it puts us on guard as well. Their technology is being explained, but only when the characters absolutely need to mention it. The rest stays unsaid, but is made clear by other aspects of the movie than dialogue.<br/><br/>If that alone is not enough to prove that Ridley Scott is a cinematic genius, we'll talk a bit more about him. He delivered his vision of a movie that's 'Jaws in space' the way he wanted it and the way we needed it. Scott makes movies the way no one has ever seen one: visually renewing, with a whole new believable world to tell a story in (also take a look at 'Blade Runner' (1982), 'Gladiator' (2000), 'The Martian' (2017) ...). This one in particular is one of my favourites in terms of style.
Take the design of the hostile Alien creature (the Xenomorph). When shown the work of Swiss artist H.G. Giger by screenwriter O'Bannon, he saw the potential it possessed and had Giger design the creature. The result is as terrifying as it is artful. Appearing as vaguely human, but out of this world in all its aspects.
The characters in the first drafts of the script were unisex and could be filled in by both men and women. The studio bosses, all white old males at the time, off course demanded the leading role to be an man. But, Scott said no. In his vision, the main character was a woman, simple as that. And let's be honest, without Sigourney Weaver, this movie would never have been as good as it is. She (the whole cast to be honest, but especially her) had me gasping for breath again and again. Her panic and determination are compelling.
All this, and the way he ingeniously builds scenes where the tension gets unbearable and the way he added and cut scenes in order to tell the full story without interrupting the flow of the film, prove that he is one heck of a film maker.<br/><br/>This is also a feminist movie, although many will argue that it was never intended to be. But the result is a feminist movie nonetheless. Not only is the main character a woman, outstandingly brought to life by Sigourney Weaver, the underlying themes of the movie are feminist as well. Because actually, this is a movie about rape. And here, it's not only the women that can fear unwanted penetration, but also the men. This rape-theme, executed by the so-called 'Face-Huggers', is unsettling for all viewers. Also notice the phallus-like design of the Alien creatures.<br/><br/>The tension is guided by the subtle score of Jerry Goldsmith. The panting flutes, the wailing violins, the assaulting brass section and the beautiful main theme. It is a composition that is unmatched in the horror genre. And where modern scores for scary movies, mean nothing more than a scary addition to the film, this modernist score truly tells a story on its own.<br/><br/>'Alien' is, all snobbish intellectual analyses put aside, in the first place one of the best horror films ever made. It gives everyone the creeps, it lingers and it's pure art. And come on: there is a cat! How can you not like this movie? But what makes it truly great, is the fact that when you look a bit closer, there's more to it than meets the eye at first.<br/><br/>And remember, if you ever get to journey through our solar system or beyond...
In space, no one can hear you scream."

","Tonight I got the chance to view the perennial sci-fi horror classic in all its glory on the big screen, celebrating 40 years since its inception, and my god does it stand the test of time.<br/><br/>Derek Vanlint cinematography is masterful to say the least, perfectly embodying the elements of horror through utilising claustrophobic camerawork and a bleak blue and grey colour palette, however, it's his use of lighting that truly captures the chilling overtones. Shafts of light seep in through vent grates, puncturing the smoky atmosphere in abundance, strobe lighting creates a sense of agitation as the creature hunts the crew members one by one, whilst flurries of neon blue and red shimmers ground it to its science fiction roots.<br/><br/>The sound, or lack of, further builds unease, with Jerry Goldsmith's humming drone of a score crafting an eerie tension that only erupts when utterly necessary, standing as one of the first films to EFFECTIVELY utilise jump scares. The use of clanging chains and scraping metal highlighting the anxiety being established alongside impressive and colossal sets. The production design is utterly stunning, from the confined corridors of the Nostromo to the vast expanse of the alien world.<br/><br/>This film will forever remain an exemplary addition to the sci-fi genre. Gorgeous and terrifying cinematography, a haunting score, immense set design and some brilliant performance from the main cast, that aided in creating one of the greatest female action heroines of all time, upping her game further in Cameron's follow-up action flick. 'Alien' is truly masterful."
"blastshafira","9","2","3","19 November 2018"," Best two hours of my life
","The very first movie of the Alien movie franchise and definitely one of the best sci-fi movie of all time and for me, the best movie in the whole franchise. Despite being an old movie, the props are UNREAL. It's unbelievably realistic, fascinating and the details are gruesome yet magnificent.
It's bewildering how someone could think of such story in 1979 where the whole alien-conspiracy was not a hit. and what's more amazing is how clear they plot is. No filler and needless details. The movie certainly gives a very tense feel even until the very end.
If i didn't know what time the movie was made, i would've guessed it was made in the 2000s. Definitely a must watch because it lives up to everyone's expectation. They still put a little bit of moral value in this movie-- that science is not necessary if it means putting humanity at risk. All the casts successfully portray their characters."

","I was a graduate student when I went and saw this film. I was working on a Masters in Computer Science at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and I went with a friend, a doctoral candidate (I was his grader). I had no idea upon walking into that theater I was going to be pinned to my seat so overwrought that I was going to get a splitting headache (only one other movie has caused me a headache and that was 'The Passion of the Christ'). I know the movie seems tame now but at the time for a student who rarely got a decent nights sleep and who was emotionally drained from the constant stress the Masters program put me through (sure I can write a compiler in a week, no problem!) it was just too much for the senses and nerves. This science fiction masterpiece was also the ultimate horror picture. The kids of today probably would think nothing of it but it blew me away!

","While most people love Aliens, the sequel to this film, for my money nothing beats the first Alien movie. Considering when this came out in the late 70s, the only other ""kid on the block"" was the original Star Wars movie from 1977. While that Star Wars will always be my favorite movie of all time, Alien took sci-fi and horror to a whole new level.<br/><br/>There is nothing but artistry in this movie: the sets are amazing and extremely realistic, the sound and music are pulse-pounding and intense, the effects are almost all practical (all of them are pre-CG). The actors all do a superb job and there are a couple of surprises that happen in terms of who does what and where loyalties truly lie.<br/><br/>Then there is the Alien, a product of master artist HR Giger's nightmares. Ridley Scott chose to show LESS of the Alien rather than more of it, which makes you wonder where it is at all times. Is that shadow over there where it's hiding? Is it crouching amongst the pipes? Will it jump out an attack at any point? All of this tension is created by showing as little of the creature as possible.<br/><br/>Also, this is not a fast bang up action movie. This is a slowly paced film that works to build tension and horror in a masterful way. There is no shaky cam or other poorly shot footage, everything is meticulously done.<br/><br/>In case you are reading this and have not seen the movie, I will not spoil it for you. But you owe it to yourself to see a sci-fi classic in the way these kind of movies used to be made."

","""Alien"" is Ridley Scott's first great feature film, and could probably be his magnum opus if not for ""Blade Runner"", which is the other masterwork of his. Honestly, I cannot be sure if he belongs to the pantheon of great filmmakers or not. He spearheaded near-perfect pictures in his earlier days, but his later works like ""The Counselor"" and ""Exodus: Gods and kings"" are near forgettable. ""Body of Lies"" and ""Robin Hood"" are not very well received either, and Oscar winning ""Gladiator"" is overrated.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly ""Alien"" is so influential. It spawned three sequels and one indirect prequel thus far, for which they were helmed by three different film directors except ""Prometheus"", which is also directed by Ridley. Its influence stretched even further when it got expanded into video games and even comics. Thus this inevitably made Ridley to be one of the most respected filmmaker in Hollywood of his times. His success is more to be evident in ""Blade Runner"".<br/><br/>""Alien"" is the story of a group of ordinary workers who went missing in the stars. The spacecraft 'Nostromo' is on its way back to Earth when it receives a transmission from a nearby planetoid. Obeying the protocol set by the company, the crew agree to land the ship to inspect on the source. They go out to locate the signal, but to only later realize that they bring back something with them to the ship that would decimate the whole crew.<br/><br/>Although Ridley is so-called the leader of the project, it was scriptwriters Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett the ones initiated it. Everything we see in the story, is theirs. ""Alien"" got inspirations from classic sci-fi movies like ""The Thing from Another World"" and ""Forbidden Planet"", despite it being an 'original' story. The product is like when different ideas from different sources assimilated and converted into an ultimate masterpiece. Ridley skillfully visualized the ideas, but ""Alien"" will never happen without the duo.<br/><br/>From the horrors to the romanticism of its opening, the film is so grasped of perfection. One of the keys to the film's critical success is its pacing. It seemed to be like a kind of slow-burn horror, which slowly but exceptionally captured the details of the movie; like its filmmaking and narrative thrust that all together built-up in favour of for coherence.<br/><br/>It was a smart move for Ridley to not shoot the monster fully on camera, and this helped to preserve the authentic look of the character (Xenomorph). If more physical parts of the monster be brought upon to audiences, then flaws of the design of it can be left not concealed. On the other hand, the sets of the spaceship and planetoid were all well-designed. Ridley's direction furthermore helped to leverage its aesthetic appeal.<br/><br/>The superb collaboration of Ridley, its writers, the composer of musical score, designers and crews had made ""Alien"" to be the atmospheric, masterful timeless sci-fi horror. ""Alien"" could easily be a mediocre B movie, but Ridley's brilliant direction turned it into one of the greatest films instead. Who would have had expected that a script not so intricate can be converted into a piece that will stay relevant for decades to come? The feat here is rarely being felt and I doubt that it will happen again. I am so sure that as long as cinema is culturally still important to us, ""Alien"" will never be forgotten.<br/><br/>(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)"

","I first saw ""Alien"" the day after it opened, knowing very little about it except that the cryptic TV commercial for the film looked cool and its advertising slogan (""In space, no one can hear you scream"") was compelling. Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott were mostly unknown and the rest of cast, while recognizable, weren't typically headliners in highly anticipated Hollywood releases. This had ""B-movie"" written all over it, and in many ways it is very much a B-movie made with A-list skill, craftsmanship and imagination.<br/><br/>It's impossible, all these years and several viewings later, to separate myself from my first experience of watching it. I can't forget that I nearly jumped back a row, to the accompanying screams of a nearly full theatre of moviegoers, during the now-famous chest- bursting scene. The iconic imagery of the film -- the sensuous design of the alien ship, the ominously large corpse of the alien spaceman fused to his giant perch with bones bent outward, the unknowable originality of the titular creature and its unpredictable life cycle, the lived-in character of the commercial towing vessel Nostromo (""Star Wars"" excepted, in most depictions of space travel at the time everything had a factory-fresh gleam) -- all became almost instantly iconic and influential for a reason. Having experienced this film's introduction into an unsuspecting world, it's not possible to look at it through the eyes of contemporary film fans who come to it later and might judge it by a different standard.<br/><br/>All of which it to say, I admit to being incredibly biased in my assessment of how well ""Alien"" holds up despite the considerable advances in visual effects since it was made. What looks a bit dated today is the depiction of the on-board computer ""Mother"" and the bizarre blinky-light room in which it is housed. Most of the rest of the tech depictions are fine, mainly because the story doesn't rely on whiz-bang futuristic tech to propel it. The basic (and, alas, inadequate) weaponry with which Nostromo's crew tries to contain the alien was understandable then and now, on a non-military vessel with a civilian crew. The surprise reveal about the true nature of one of the crew members still makes sense against the backdrop of corporate shenanigans in which the crew operates. Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's story carefully constructs the sense in which the deck is stacked against our heroes in ways they don't fully grasp until a few of them have died, and it does so mainly by making the crew anything but heroic. These are ordinary workers who snipe at each other and complain about their pay and try to advance their place in the hierarchy the way workers everywhere do, and maintain an uneasy camaraderie and mutual respect despite workplace tensions that are eminently relatable.<br/><br/>A lot has been written about this film as a metaphor for both male and female rape and the predatory nature of sexuality. While the film's design is stuffed with incredible sexual imagery, I'm not really sure what that analysis gets you. ""Alien"" is essentially a very effective, beautifully shot horror movie set in outer space. It employed and helped solidify horror movie tropes we're all familiar with. It's not afraid to take its time to build atmosphere, character and suspense, which might (but shouldn't) try the patience of people used to the faster pace of current films. To me, it was and remains an almost perfect movie."

","There are relatively few films in history that are so solid and well made that they are the definition of a 4/4 star movie. Alien is one of those films. Movies have become so flawed in recent decades that truly handing out the full rating of 4 stars out of 4 (or 10 out of 10 for IMDb) has become a stretch.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, Alien is not only a classic and the best science fiction horror movie of all time, but it is also one of the best films of all time. It is one of the coolest, most bad-ass, and horrifying films you will ever see.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is phenomenal in the role that shot her to fame. She is the heart of the film and plays her part with a sort of innocence and naive youthfulness that is endearing and real. Who would have ever thought a woman could be so bad-ass in a science fiction/action/horror movie in 1979? <br/><br/>This movie is so good shot for shot that you will be glued to the screen. You can't miss a minute, nor will you want to. Even after all the similar sorts of horror and sci fi films that have been made which have borrowed from Alien, none of them can put together what Alien did. <br/><br/>Some movies just rock. They just know how to open,know how to show, know how to tell, know how to explode, and know how to end. This is one of them. The ending is perfect and a perfect example of how to tell a story and end a movie, something many films of today can learn from."

","The film opens in the year 2122 AD, with the crew of seven members of the grimy, commercial space towing-freighter Nostromo being awakened from hyper sleep by the ship's main computer, nicknamed Mother. This is because they receive a transmission signal ""of unknown origin"" from a nearby planet and they decide to go investigate it. Capt. Dallas's rescue team discovers a bizarre pod field, but things get even stranger when a face-hugging creature bursts out of a pod and attaches itself to Kane, one of the members of the crew.

Does the highest rated horror movie on IMDb deserve its praise?<br/><br/>Short answer: yes. Alien does have a handful of short-comings, such as some implausibilities including technology (the worst self destruct system of all time). These count for nearly naught. You won't be terrified by this movie, but it doesn't deny that this gripping film remains to be the perfect sci fi-horror film. While some good sci-fi horror films exist, such as Predator, The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, none have been able to replicate this movie's atmosphere and tension. Whether its the infamous Chestburster sequence, Dallas' death in the vents, or Lambert's off screen violation, there is no doubt that this psycho-sexual, claustrophobic, star wars turned R horror movie will be remembered by myself as Ridley Scott's greatest contribution to mankind.

","I know I'm REALLY late to the party, but I finally watched Alien. I can see now why it's so huge and spawned so many sequels. The film was very well put together, which is no surprise considering it was made by Ridley Scott. The sets were great, the atmosphere was great, the music was great. I was thoroughly creeped out by the alien lifeforms - both because they were really ugly and anything parasitic gives me the heebie-jeebies. The main creature alone looked pretty terrifying. <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver as always was a badass and I really appreciated the grit and strength of her character. She stood her ground against her male counterparts who weren't following the rules and then was ruthless with the monster. It made me happy at the end when she saved the cat. It's not just because I love cats (or because I would also be that person), but because it's important not to consider lower lifeforms any less of a priority than humans. The cat was there, it was alive, and therefore it was worth saving. I don't know if that's what they were going for, but think it is a very good message. <br/><br/>The only real issue I had with this film was that the characters made such blatantly bad decisions in terms of the situation, which were clearly made so the story would work. Of course they shouldn't have brought an unknown alien life form back onto the ship. No, they shouldn't have left it mostly unattended and attached to their crew mate in a room that was wide open. And no, when it went missing they shouldn't have walked into the room with no weapons or no way to trap it, all while leaving the door wide open for most of their search. Then they kept separating to find the creature, with no real plan of what to do when they actually did, aside from sending it out into space. They were already told it was pretty indestructible. I would have liked to see more effort put into the escalation of the story in that respect, but as the end result was so good it's something I can look over. I will definitely be watching the other films."

","Ridley Scott's Alien really is a good film, even though it's sequel Aliens (1986) is better. This movie focuses on Ellen Ripley and her crew as this bloodthirsty alien runs amuck onboard. The movie takes a little while to get itself going, I didn't really mind that when something interesting was going on, but there were a few parts in the beginning were I just wanted them to move it along. I don't mind taking a bit longer to get the film started just as long as you keep me fairly interested and entertained while you're building up to things. The acting is very impressive in the movie, of course Sigourney Weaver is spot on great like always. The other supporting actors are pretty good. The effects are very good for 1979! The special effects in this movie is MILES better and a lot more effective than in 1992's alien 3. The action scenes are filmed well, a couple of the killing scenes are similar to like a slasher/regular horror killing, but then others are incredibly original and creative. I think everyone who has heard of this movie knows what scene I'm speaking about. Yes, it involves a man's chest and an alien. That scene is oh so effective! Very well done shocking scene. Overall this is a good entertaining well acted choice for a watch, but just wait until you see aliens!! 7/10"
"anshuman-manur","7","1","1","1 September 2013"," Captivating thriller but fails to address bigger questions...
","At the outset, I want to say that although I rate the film 7/10, I was disappointed by it. When I first came across the film, its title, its filmmaker and its general acclaim by the public, I was looking forward to something completely different. What I mean is that there are so many complex questions that the idea of extraterrestrial life throws up, and Alien does not as much as attempt to even pose such questions. What is man's place in the universe? What can the form of a living thing (here, the alien's) teach us about being? Science-fiction is a particularly potent literary form to address such questions. And although I sense the influence of that giant of science-fiction cinema, the one that so magically haunts us with its depiction of man's supposed evolution (yes, I speak of 2001: A Space Odyssey), Alien is nothing more than a thriller that capitalises on its setting in deep space, on the terror of being so far away from home.<br/><br/>Having gotten the rant about my initial disappointment out of the way, I will now proceed to say why Alien is a good film. It is gripping! The settings are realistic and believable; the actors are great; the scenes of exploration of the alien planet are intense; and towards the end we get a great shot of Sigourney Weaver, her tiny panties almost dangling across her butt, stretching her arms to reach some switches above her, reminding us warmly of the sensuality of the female form after the grisly inhumanness of the alien. But the terror is real! And captivating! And this is what makes Alien worth watching!"
"jimbo-53-186511","7","1","1","13 April 2013"," Technically well made, but let down by an anticlimactic ending
","One thing you can definitely say about Alien is that it's atmospheric. Right from the start when the camera is panning round the ship, you know that you are in for something special.<br/><br/>It is also excellent the way in which the tension is built once they arrive at the distant planet. The cinematography was really good and really gave the impression that we are at a desperate and bleak place. I believe that a lot of this is down to Ridley Scott's direction which in Alien I thought was fantastic - some of the camera angles that were used really helped to create an air of suspense throughout the film.<br/><br/>The special effects were also brilliant (considering this was made in 1979) and I thought that the alien itself looked menacing - although in all honesty I only thought it looked menacing when it developed to full size. I almost laughed when it came out of Kane's stomach and then shot across the room.<br/><br/>The main crew includes Ripley (Weaver) Dallas (Skerritt) Kane (Hurt) Parker (Kotto) Lambert (Cartwright) Brett (Stanton) and Ash (Holm). Whilst all of the actors were good in their respective roles, I didn't feel that any one gave a stand out performance.<br/><br/>Alien is technically well made and it certainly ticks all the major boxes; Atmospheric, Tense, Suspenseful, Good Acting, Special Effects & Cinematography. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the only thing Ridley Scott didn't do is come up with a good ending. For me this film had one of the most anti-climatic endings that I've seen. I thought after the way that the Alien was built up and having seen how easily it killed all of Ripley's crew that there might have been a major battle between Ripley and the Alien. Instead of that, we have Ripley running round the ship with the Alien seemingly not bothering to chase her. She then picks up her cat, gets in her space capsule (a few minutes prior to this she set their mining ship up to self destruct) and low and behold there the alien is seemingly wedged into the front of the capsule (for no apparent reason and seemingly with no explanation as to how it got there) then she tries to gas it and eventually fires at it and shoots him out of the capsule and that's pretty much the end. This film could have been so much better if Ridley Scott would have thought more about the ending - I think Ripley being stalked round the ship by the Alien and having a 'proper final showdown' - a physical struggle with it at the least, would have been much more of a fitting way of ending the film as that at least would have added a little tension. Despite the poor ending, I still enjoyed the film and rated it 7/10."
"thesar-2","7","1","1","18 January 2011"," I Was Four ThenThis was Truly Alien to Me
","OkayI admit itI'm not a huge Alien fan. Well, of the aliens, yesjust not the 1979 Ridley Scott movie: Alien (#1 of 4, so far.)<br/><br/>This is how it went down: When I was a kid, I watched all and any horror I could get my hands on. Of course, mostly with the permission from my parents who wouldn't even let me watch Gremlins. Somehow Alien got past me and I must've watched the (far superior, I wouldn't know until much later) sequel Aliens a dozen or 50 times. So, I was kinda used to that one and loved the action and the multiple aliens.<br/><br/>See? That was the problem. You sincerely backtrack by watching #2 first followed by the original. The movie is oneoftheslowestmovingpictures I've ever seen. And it only contained ONE alien (not counting the face-hugger or the eggs) that's only shown after a good hour or more passes AND then in only bursts of screen time.<br/><br/>When you're a kid, this is un-scary and thoroughly unacceptable. Hence, I didn't care for it back then. What happens when you're an adult, as I am now? Yeah, same. I was unfrightened and bored for the most part.<br/><br/>Lucky for the movie, the only real bad thing I observed was the pacing. The ""one alien"" concept, I accept, was necessary to show how threatening these things were. But also, in 1979 with budgets and such, I'm sure it was also the only thing they could do. (Thanks, James, for the sequel and confidence.)<br/><br/>But, by God, the pacingtick tock. I'm shocked this wasn't directed by Michael Mann (Heat, The Insider, and Manhunter,) one of my least favorite directors for his inch-by-inch/minutes feel like hours story telling.<br/><br/>Okay, I'll give it to the adults (it is rated R, so I assume – ha – that no one under 17 was admitted) in 1979 that this idea, though not entirely fresh – alien attacks were a 1950s staple duh, might have scared some people because, quite possibly, it was the first hard R gorefest involving an (not illegal, but space) alien with a budget.<br/><br/>Also, the movie had excellent acting and rich characters with depth – I've been told, though not confirmed, that the cast didn't care for each other, but you wouldn't tell that here, an excellent score, gorgeous cinematography, fantastic sets and designs and introduced two of the best characters in cinema history: Ellen Ripley (Weaver) and of course the never-ending/hard-to-kill Alien.<br/><br/>Up to the point of those last few praises, you'd think I hated the movie. Well, no, but it's nothing I ever want to revisit. I can appreciate all those wonderful qualities, plus, again, I loved the character of Ripley and the idea of the alienbut I can enjoy myself tenfold in the follow-up, Aliens.<br/><br/>A quick rundown of the synopsis: hard working/middle class space miners are returning to Earth from deep space when ""Mother,"" their ship's version of Hal 9000 or ""Computer"" (on the USS Enterprise, the NCC 1701 version, not the one where porn's shown freely) intercepts a ""distress"" call and commands the ship to investigate. The crew's awaken from their cryogenic sleep and are unhappy.<br/><br/>Well, they will be soon when one is ""impregnated"" from a soft alien scorpion. (VERY) soon the full blown alien bursts, literally, onto the scene and it's up to the unprepared passengers to fight off the unwanted guest. Actually, they're more like cattle, until the unlikeliest (in 1979, that is) hero(ine) emerges, warding off both machine, man and beast. Talk about a bad wake up call.<br/><br/>Again, the movie is very well crafted – this did elevate the same ole ""alien"" story with great special effects and we have to thank both Director Scott and Sigourney Weaver for creating such an awesome character in Ripley. But, get a Mountain Dew before watching or have the patience of a hungry tortoise who's a mile from food to get through to the end. Better yet, pop in Aliens. They'll give you the run down on this entire movie in a just a few brief minutes and then you can enjoy all the action, drive and horror the aliens can really produce."

The subplot involving Ian Holm's character, Ash, is fairly interesting but I always felt that it bogged the film down. Overall, the cast is pretty decent; there are no astonishing performances, however. Now for some of the film's high points; Ridley Scott's direction is phenomenal. His attention to detail is astounding. Jerry Goldsmith's musical score is great; it is very effective and quite ominous and unnerving. The art direction and set decoration in Alien is absolutely terrific. The sets are large and yet they have a very claustrophobic feel. The special effects for the alien creature are quite convincing. The alien is not shown in prolonged shots or whole-body shots. This is a wise decision on the filmmakers' part; had the alien been shown in full body shots it would give the impression of someone in a suit and so wouldn't be as convincing.

","This movie is probably one the greatest sci-fi milestones ever made. The plot seems very simple, and indeed it is. But this is not in anyway a plot driven movie. What makes this movie great are its environments brought to life by a flawless and genius direction by Ridley Scott. The characters, all built by strong performances, specially by Tom Skerrit, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm and John Hurt, seem completely convincing as 22nd century people crewing the ""Nostromo"", a titanic starship. When the appearance of the alien comes, the designs made by H.R. Giger are quite notable, making the creature itself also a milestone in horror and sci-fi. The only problem I can see in the movie is the fast pace of the end sequence that leaves behind the questions about the nature of the creature itself, that as a scene shows, is a reflection on a broken mirror of humanity itself. That doesn't stop it from being a great movie."

","The movie is quite good if you know it's from 1979.At this time they couldn't work with great effects like in the new Alien-films.So with no fantastic effects trying to create a Sci-Fi film where effects are from big importance is difficult.But Scott succeeded, it's one of these movies you know from the first minute on that it's something special.And that's quite right, because through that film Scott created a new genre or at least gave now life to Sci-Fi. Very enjoyable is to buy the Alien-films all together and watch them a weekend through.So you get the story at one piece and don't have to remind yourself everytime new.Also you can see how Sigourney Weaver changes in every film.This shall NOT be promotion, but I did so and was surprised."
"criehle","10","23","84","13 February 2005"," Ridley Scott's classic has run out of gas.
","Alien is a film that will forever go down in history. It has earned a place among the greatest horror movies of all time and was put there by the fans. I know people who have seen this film literally dozens of times and are scared by it each time. The first time I saw Alien I was four years old... and it put me to sleep in a manner of minutes. Till this day it still accomplishes that.<br/><br/>I have seen Alien 5 times. Each time I struggle to stay awake. I find this film so incredibly boring & dull. I understand why so many people find this film scary. When they tell me why they were scared I don't think ""What the hell is the matter with these people?"". Yet the formula seems to be scared by does not work on me.<br/><br/>Much like AVP, the films lacks what the title promises. You barely see the Alien. I know most people credit that to the films horror, but for me I find it incredibly annoying and frustrating. When I go to a movie called Alien I want to see an Alien! Overall the title character gets only about 30 seconds of screen time. When the film was done I couldn't even describe what the creature looked like. The least they could have done is give the Alien enough screen time so the audience could actually KNOW what it looked like.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott pretty much invented the formula of hiding the monster and using the characters to sell the fear. The problem is he over used it. He used way too much characters and way too little Alien. There needs to be a perfect balance between the two like James Cameron did with Aliens. He hid the Aliens till half-way through the movie but at least he gave us long enough looks at the Aliens that we had a perfect picture of what it looked like.<br/><br/>Alien is another one of those films that has earned a place in cinema history. But yet I have never been caught up in the terror so many people claim it has."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","4","9","31 July 2017"," A good film, but maybe a bit overrated
","Here we have the 1979 2-hour film Alien and this one is the beginning of a franchise that is still going on today, again with Ridley Scott in charge, the man who also directed this original movie. It is all about what happens when an alien creature ends up on a spaceship full of scientists in the future. Lets just say that it is not full of scientists anymore at the end. The movie won an Oscar for its special effects and scored another nomination. These days, despite being almost 40 years old (or because of?), it is considered a classic when it comes to combining the horror and sci-fi genres. The most known cast member is certainly lead actress Sigourney Weaver and she keeps moving more and more into the center of it all the longer the film goes and there are other pretty well-known actors in the relatively small cast here. Still, this is at no point an actors' movie. It is all about the creature, the fight for survival and of course the technical aspects (both visually and audibly). And last but not least about the scare factor: I think they did a pretty good job here in elevating this film beyond mediocre jump scares as the creature attacks sometimes when you don't expect it and does nothing when you do expect it like when the second victim was looking up at the ceiling in search of his cat.<br/><br/>Some solid plot twists about crew members and the general plan involving the creature work in the film's favor too. You have to dig deep for flaws, but here and there you find one. Maybe Ripley is sometimes depicted too heroically for a film that definitely tries to go for realism at the very core of it all. I also could have done without the epilogue outside the ship I guess, but I'll accept it for the thrills. Just personal preference though obviously. It was a good watch, but almost top50 films of all times (as here on IMDb) is certainly exaggerated. I will probably check out the James Cameron sequel at some point too, but these 2 hours were not on a level where I would want to do it immediately. Overall, a thumbs-up though. Certainly worth checking out if you love SciFi. A lot was done right here and there were certainly scenes that could have gone horribly wrong with less competent people in charge. Lucky for us, they did not. Go see it."

","I just bought the Special VHS edition from 1997(?). I've never seen it on the big screen, but I wonder if that treatment would clarify some of the murky alien planet shots. The back cover of the box offers a doctored up still from the alien spaceship, so that you see the set detail, but all the while in the movie, you can't help but wonder ""what IS that thing, or where are they?"" The best visuals are in establishing exterior or interior shots that resemble 2001 (truely dumb movie) or the original Star Wars (think Millenneum Falcon).<br/><br/>I'm a science fiction fan, and not a horror fan. This movie has more horror than science fiction with it's improbable plot and characters that are, simply, ""monster chow."" Are modern corporations in the habit of taking stupendous risks with multi-billion dollar equipment for the sake of curiosity? Couldn't they have just sent a probe? establish a communication link? ignore the transmission and bring their precious cargo and the Nostromo home? Plus, I noticed an awful lot of foreshadowing in the first two acts of the movie. Gee, who is going to ""buy it first?"" Is Ash a bad guy?--I dunno. . .<br/><br/>However, the cast is terrific, and they do their best. Not only that, but I'm not really disappointed with this movie; I just think it could've been better. The android subplot is really cool. Maybe this movie was a risky experiment, but it is a valuable film.<br/><br/>Aliens is more exciting, and has better characters and dialog (except Newt--horrible child actor!), and I haven't really bothered with the other two--maybe about 12 minutes viewing time for both combined. Alien is not easy to watch, but impossible to ignore, that's for sure."
"KieranSaosila","7","3","6","24 May 2018"," Classic but not perfect, sci-fi-horror.
","Ridley Scott directs Alien. A story following a small crew aboard a cargo ship in outer space, who come into contact with a mysterious alien life form that turns out to be a murderous predator. After seeing Alien I can safely say all my hopes and dreams of one day visiting the cosmos are now down the drain. This movie is a chilling and well set up narrative that will have you checking under your bed forevermore.<br/><br/>One of the films greatest qualities is also its weakest, and that is the pacing. I have to respect that a lot of attention went into the set up of the tone, environment and the atmosphere of the story. Though at times it can feel quite slow, and there are scenes that feel a little dragged out and unnecessary. On the contrary, the climax does feel well deserved and definitely pays off. I just think a little more attention to detail could of been aimed towards the actual telling of the characters themselves and who these people are. I love that the film takes it's time to tell the story, but only wish there was a bit more to it in terms of character development.<br/><br/>Due to the fact we don't really know anything about these characters apart from their roles on the ship, I find it so hard to care about the events they go through. Despite this, all character interactions feel genuine and believable so we can at least recognise these people know and care for each other which gives it that extra weight. The one standout that I think all people would agree with is Ellen Ripley, who ends up taking centre stage at some point during the movie and gives us a strong, bad-ass female protagonist that has become an icon for the sci-fi genre. As I say, there's not much to know about the character herself, though Sigourney Weaver plays the part to perfection and without her I definitely feel the film would lose points. <br/><br/>Negatives aside, the film is wonderfully shot. There's a great use of lighting throughout the film that helps to set tone, one great example would be a scene involving a strobe light effect which is very intense to say the least. The design of the film is outstanding. Ridley managed to capture the vision of a believable futuristic space ship we all hope to see within our grasp someday, and you can definitely feel that this is a si-fi film right from the get go. From panels on the ship walls to switches, levers, buttons and sounds there is detail in every shot and a strong lived-in vibe is present among the ship.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the alien itself. The special effects for the alien are off the charts. There are maybe one or two scenes where you may easily be able to tell it's an animatronic. Though for majority of the film the alien looks and feels horrifically real. This isn't your typical balloon headed bulgy eyes alien, this thing is beastly and sinister, it's an original and unique realisation. Sound plays an enormous part in bringing the alien to life too, with animalistic snarls and screeches it's almost as if they genetically spawned an alien for the film itself. With the addition of the alien, this is where the sci-fi becomes sci-fi-horror. There are some disturbingly gruesome and distressing scenes throughout the story that will have you immediately convinced this being is not at all the friendly kind.<br/><br/>Alien is a well directed film that has a slow start though respectively builds up to a unnerving third act filled with suspense and horror. A great use of special and visual effects are present especially for the time it was filmed in. Little character development despite a standout Sigourney Weaver and a very satisfying climax. Not the masterpiece I hear it is but a great film nonetheless."

It could have imitated a million life forms on a million planets. Now, it wants Earth!"" - Dr Blaire (""The Thing"") <br/><br/>""If the sales are good, we'll make another."" - Ridley Scott<br/><br/>Ridley Scott directs ""Alien"". A haunted house tale, the film watches as the blue-collar crew of the space-freighter Nostromo are systematically killed by a mysterious alien. This alien, slimy and phallic, functions as a kind of roving penis, a reproductive machine which exists only to rape, inseminate and reproduce.<br/><br/>Much of the film finds an astronaut called Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) being menaced by both the biomechanical horror of the creature, and the cold inhumanity of a certain, very 1970s corporatism (epitomized in the film by scheming computers, duplicitous robots and traitorous companies). Ripley's softer, feminine instincts are repeatedly conspired against in the ""Alien"" franchise. This has led to Scott's film being labelled ""feminist"". It's not. Ripley merely reprises your typical damsel-in-distress role, stripping down to her panties, fleeing secreting penises and choking on phallic Playboy magazines, all for the audience. By the franchise's end, she would become the alien queen; the source of the beasts.<br/><br/>As is now well known, the film's sets and creature designs were inspired by both Swiss designer H.R. Giger and ""Heavy Metal"" artist Mobius. Their visions, coupled to Ridley Scott's own elaborate storyboards, were responsible for ""Alien's"" budget being graciously tripled by the film's producers. The money men saw a hit on their hands. ""Jaws 2"" became the highest grossing sequel the year before.<br/><br/>The film's tone mixes cinema verite, classy Kubrickian camera work and B movie peek-a-boos. It was one of several films to bring the venereal horror of Giallo splatter cinema into the mainstream. Despite a strong start, though, ""Alien"" gets increasingly predictable. The film differs from other slasher movies only in the way it makes overt the sexual undercurrents bed-rocking the violence of its siblings. Dripping with post-coital atmosphere, Scott's set pieces are staged as literal rapes and overt intergalactic sex sessions, making explicit the unconscious of other slasher movies, with their maulings, penetrations and blood orgasms. And as with most slasher movies, Scott's characters exist only to be killed. They behave stupidly throughout and are thinly sketched.<br/><br/>Though the 1960s and 70s were seen as cinema's liberative, post-studio era, the period's permissiveness had the opposite effect and quickly spawned an increasingly rigid film industry. One sees this most clearly with the ""horror classics"" of the 1970s, most of which were redecorated B movies of the past, only now with A-list budgets, newfandangled gore and modern special effects. These films pandered to the audience's basest instincts, pandered to the audience's most self aggrandising understanding of itself, but they raked in big cash and offered the possibility of incessant sequels, so all was fine; the model works, so it procreates. Today virtually all Hollywood movies are B movies, retro, or exploitation films glossed up in glitz. And as their goal is to tap into increasingly harder highs, and as anything over a pg12 rating is now viewed as being too niche (or ""demographically conservative"" in producer speak), one eventually ends up with schizophrenic horror movies like Ridley Scott's own ""Prometheus"", which simultaneously tries to recapture the shocks of the past (Caesarean sections/abortions replacing ""chest births"") whilst also being bloodless and sanitised. You know. For kids, gore hounds and nostalgic old timers all at once.<br/><br/>Most of the ""classics"" of 1970s horror ""updated"" or ""dressed up"" their predecessors. Spielberg's ""Jaws"", for example, borrows the score and various scenes/shots from ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"", whilst Cameron's ""Aliens"" climaxes with the ending to ""Them!"". Ridley Scott's predecessors are Ford's ""The Lost Patrol"", Hawks' ""The Thing"", and horror schlock like ""Fiend Without a Face"", and ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"". The film's narrative structure, which tricks you into thinking its a tale about men, before turning a female astronaut into its central hero, recalls ""Psycho"" and Hooper's ""Chainsaw Massacre"".<br/><br/>Old B movies, though, are Scott's chief inspiration, particularly Mario Bava's underrated ""Planet of the Vampires"", which also features a space crew responding to a distress signal, landing on an alien planet, exploring a derelict ship, finding giant alien skeletons and coming under attack from monsters. Scott's horse-shoe alien ship is also Bava's, as are his smoky, rocky planet surfaces, shots of helmets next to flight chairs, alien climates, alien interiors and flame thrower guns. Scott's big set piece, in which his crew stumble across the giant skeleton of an ancient alien, even recalls an identical scene in Bava's flick. Elsewhere Scott's face hugging critters recall the creatures of ""Fiend Without a Face"", and his last act, with air ducts, ventilation shaft encounters and a climax in which the alien is blown out an airlock, recalls ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"", another film in which astronauts respond to distress signals and explore alien derelicts. Scott would deny the influence of ""Planet of the Vampires"" for many years, but seems to have finally admitted it with ""Prometheus"". In addition to other similarities, Prometheus' crew are unmistakeably wearing the skintight suits of Bava's own astronauts.<br/><br/>8/10 – Worth multiple viewings."

","Alien is a science fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto. The film's title refers to its primary antagonist: a highly aggressive extraterrestrial creature that stalks and kills the crew of a spaceship. Dan O'Bannon wrote the screenplay from a story by him and Ronald Shusett, drawing influence from previous works of science fiction and horror. The film was produced through Brandywine Productions and distributed by 20th Century Fox, with producers David Giler and Walter Hill making significant revisions and additions to the script. The titular Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the human aspects of the film.<br/><br/>A close encounter of the third kind becomes a Jaws-style nightmare when an alien invades a spacecraft in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic. On the way home from a mission for the Company, the Nostromo's crew is woken up from hibernation by the ship's Mother computer to answer a distress signal from a nearby planet. Capt. Dallas's rescue team discovers a bizarre pod field, but things get even stranger when a face- hugging creature bursts out of a pod and attaches itself to Kane. Over the objections of Ripley, science officer Ash lets Kane back on the ship. The acid-blooded incubus detaches itself from an apparently recovered Kane, but an alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The alien starts stalking the humans, pitting Dallas and his crew as well as the cat against a malevolent killing machine that also has a protector in the nefarious Company. <br/><br/>The movie remains a benchmark of extra-terrestrial horror, and gave us a bona fide A-list star in the shape of Sigourney Weaver.Also,it is nothing short of a masterpiece. Technically brilliant, tense, horrifying and visually breathtaking, there's not a moment in this B-monster movie that doesn't excel well beyond the usual genre trappings.Aside from that,it proved that material derided as B-movie fodder could be handled with finesse and glossy production values, without diminishing the thrills or polishing over the hard-edged horror.Although there's nothing terribly complex or original about the movie, but it is distinguished by its clever and innovative use of B-movie staples in a hi-tech setting.In summary,it is a landmark of sci-fi horror cinema excellence."
"joshi_3592","7","3","6","7 October 2009"," I give this film credit for the inspiration it has given to so many other movies. But I felt certain things where missing.
","Now as you can see by my rating I did not hate this movie. It has a great story and a really creepy atmosphere. The acting is great and the special effects can not be looked down on.<br/><br/>The story is simple, a cargo ship picks up an transmission of alien origin, they land on a planet and find a ship. The ship appears to have been attacked and there a bunch of eggs in the cargo hold or whatever it is. One of the crew; Kane(John Hurt) get's attacked by a thing in the egg that grabs his face. And that's when the nightmare starts. Soon there an vicious alien on board and it's all about survival. Now I'll stop right here.<br/><br/>What I liked about he movie was especially the acting, believable and it truly gave the movie it's dark tone. I liked the start of the movie when they found the alien spacecraft, and John Hurt's character got infected by the Alien. But that's where the fun ended slightly for me. From that point on it had some really boring scenes. The scene where Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) went to find the cat, was way to long and killed the suspense. We all knew he where gonna die, and prolonging it was just annoying. The flickering lights in the end was annoying and again ruined the suspense. When you can't see either the main character or the alien, well then it's suddenly nothing scary to see anymore.<br/><br/>Still there where many good scenes in the last part of the movie (SPOILER alert) the whole robot ash thing was a really clever and unpredictable part. It came as a shock and the effects where great. <br/><br/>But just to complain a little more, why did the ship explode three times? <br/><br/>In conclusion, once again, I did not hate this movie, I just feel there where things that could have been avoided. but I like the fact that this film has been an inspiration to many other filmmakers in it's following years. If you like this film I recommend John Carpenter' s""the Thing"".<br/><br/>My verdict for this film is 7/10, I was originally considering giving it a 6, but considering the film's great impact i must give it one star more."

What Ridley Scott has done here is take completely quiet moments, (Some horror films take moderate quiet moments), and then make the unexpected happen. The story is also great. In todays horror films, you don't get great stories. Another thing that this movie does is it takes it's time on where it wants to go and doesn't rush it. Today's audiences are so impatient with horror films that takes it's time that the director doesn't have enough time to deliver the goods. Alien also has that Gothic feel to it, and man doesn't have a Gothic feel to it. Suspiria has the same kind of feel but in Alien, the feel is more authentic mainly because it's in space, (However the Gothics in Suspiria is also authentic because of it's subject matter and the weird production designs).

"Massi025","1","23","88","28 May 2012"," Snail paced and failing to achieve true suspense
","I like to think that the slowness of the film allows for a good look at the set designs which are excellent. The entire success of this movie, where it's laurels rest, is upon those sets. Besides from that it is nothing more than another sci fi movie. I am stating this as my impression after watching it at least twenty times at home, if I had seen this movie in the theater at it's seventy-nine premier I would give it a different review.<br/><br/>Despite the realness of the alien world I am unable to suspend my disbelief and earnestly follow the action... I mean everything looks good but there is something awry with the story in which I find ridiculousness and redundancy. In the directors commentary Ridley Scott says something interesting about the cryogenic freezers that open up at the beginning of the film, he says that if you think too hard about it then it does not make sense. I say that if you think at all such a thing will be a hindrance to reason. And since the bulk of the movie is just pushed along by a continuance of sci-fi clichés such as those cryogenic ""freezer-inos"" it leaves me wondering what does this movie mean to do? I mean every movie has a purpose, film is not a reflection of life but an attempt to create a new vision for audiences that will change the course of the world. And in Alien the goal is emasculation. As a genetically born male I find a problem with the feminist orientation of the thing. <br/><br/>The film culminates with a strong female character ejecting a phallically headed creature off into the oblivion of space. The entire film equates male sexuality to a monstrosity. There is an apparent gender opposition even in the antagonism of ""mother"" the computer. Humans are trapped between a primal and bodily nature in the alien and on the other-side face the apathetic machinery of progress in the form of mother and the company. Now why are the destructive forces of progress written as female while the space of regression is shown as male? Even the android Ash is feminized by being an android which is an assuredly impotent thing, indeed he must consume a drink that looks like semen discharge because he cannot produce his own. <br/><br/>But I am not writing with the intention of deflecting love from the finer sex. I just think that there are human natures that never change and that portraying a woman in a man's role is not going to improve the world. Maybe men make more money than women in general and that is unfair but what is all the money in the world to a woman if she does not have a man to protect her. <br/><br/>Going off of that and returning to Alien I say that it is not a film that gives respect to women. I think that Sigourney Weaver appears in it scantly clad and bra-less. Enough said.<br/><br/>Leaving the arena of philosophy there are other details I have left unscathed that need to be addressed when discussing Alien. Firstly the opening shot that pans the spaceship is directly stolen from Star Wars. Next when Cain is attacked by the parasite it melts through his thick visor wall but leaves his face uninjured. When the monster kills Dallas it just is crouching there with it's arms outstretched, in fact never in the movie did I see the monster in the fluid motions of an attack. And finally, although I'm sure I could find more errors, there is the issue of the self-destructing spaceship. Why am I supposed to believe that a spaceship would just conveniently have a self-destruct mechanism, of all the vehicles man has forged thus far from the space shuttle to aircraft carriers how many of them do you know to have mechanisms designed to readily blow them to kingdom come."
"Leon_Chang_2000","5","5","13","15 June 2012"," Does not stand the test of time
","Having just watched Alien for the first time, I cannot give it more than a 5/10. The film was mediocre at best. It began slowly, and honestly, never really picked up; in fact, I almost decided to stop the movie and go do something else since it was quite boring.<br/><br/>Let me explain a bit further. The characters are weak, showing no development and very little likability. Thus, I had no care for them throughout the film and so they provided little incentive for me to keep watching. If anything, the pure annoyance at the characters' decisions made me want to turn off the movie even more.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the plot was very straightforward and could not stand by itself. If you think for a moment about what would happen in a film named ""Alien"", chances are you are spot on.<br/><br/>Because of this, I have a feeling that this movie must have stood on the laurels of its visuals and its novelty during the era. For contemporary viewers, these no longer hold much weight, and so the movie crumbles. As an analogy, I believe that similar remarks will be made about movies like James Cameron's Avatar in a few decades.<br/><br/>To summarize, this is not a film that has withstood the test of time."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","5","13","11 January 2011"," Sci-fi classic
","Easily one of Ridley Scott's finest films, and one of the best of the sci-fi genre. Alien is simply wonderful, with imaginative production design especially and a magnificent score from Jerry Goldsmith. The pace is also right on the money with a purposefully slow build-up, the editing is great, Scott's direction is superb and the story is wonderfully structured with seldom a dull moment. The script is also thought-provoking, clever and well written, while the atmosphere is just spellbinding with a perfect mixture of false scares and genuine jolts. The acting is also top notch, Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ellen Ripley, who is not only one of the most iconic characters in film history but a contender for Weaver's best ever role. It is a delight seeing fine underrated actor John Hurt, and he is great to watch as the curious crewman. Overall, defines the term sci-fi classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"r_ende","5","6","17","13 January 2007"," A huge disappointment!
","Before I watched the movie I only heard recommendations to watch this movie. But when I watched it I was highly disappointed. Many shots of the film are dark, too far away or too near. O.K., the characters are in a small star ship but many scenes are too complex. The film starts without an introduction so you don't know in which year the astronauts are for what reason in space. The rest of the movie is quite boring, sometimes Jerry Goldsmith's make some themes exciting by using appropriate music. The rest of Jerry Goldsmith's score is not bad but also not above average. I can't believe that it got a 8.4 in average at IMDb. My advice: If you want to look an alien movie, watch Star Trek, f.e. Star Trek Voyager, episode ""Scorpion""."
"hall895","5","4","10","6 April 2013"," A sci-fi horror ""classic"" which disappoints
","Upon its initial release critical reaction to Alien was mixed to negative. One notable review described it as an empty bag of tricks. One critic dismissed it as an overblown B-movie. Another called it deeply dislikeable. Then a funny thing happened. Audiences saw the film and liked it. The film became a big success. It wasn't long before the film was being touted as a classic of its genre. Critics who had initially panned the film went back and wrote entirely new reviews praising it. The film was now beyond criticism. Nobody would dare admit they did not love it. Truth is the critics had it right the first time. This film is just not very good.<br/><br/>Alien is meant to be a scary monster movie but the scares certainly don't come fast and furious. This film takes a long, long time setting itself up. Director Ridley Scott tries to build suspense. But this slow build drags on far too long for the film's good. Tension and intrigue drain away, boredom sets in. The film is often described as ""Jaws in space"" in that it's a monster movie in which we see very little of the monster. But where Steven Spielberg kept Jaws crackling along Scott's film gets terribly bogged down. Jaws also benefited from compelling characters. No such luck with Alien. Sigourney Weaver has some presence to her playing the key role of Ripley. But that character doesn't really spark to life until very late in the film. The rest of the cast has very little to do. A boring group of characters prone to doing stupid things. Like searching for a cat instead of, you know, escaping the giant murderous Alien. There are some notably fine actors here, including John Hurt and Ian Holm. But the script fails them. The characters never inspire much feeling in you at all, giving you little reason to care about their fate. There is very little story here, no character development whatsoever. A late reveal of one character's background proves more silly than shocking. The film has a memorable moment or two. But one or two moments in a two-hour film aren't nearly enough. This monster movie is monstrously overrated."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","4","10","21 April 2008"," I remain underwhelmed, I'm afraid
","This film is quite popular, at least judging from it's rating(as I'm writing this, it's placed #50 on the top 250 list). I realize that this was probably a benchmark for special effects when it was made, but now the effects seem incredibly dated(which they don't, at the very least to the same extent, in pieces from the same period, best example being Star Wars), and many scenes seem clichéd today, even though I suppose they were fresh when it was made. I guess the main problem with the thing is that it doesn't age well, but I also think it lacks too much in both character development and humor... just a little comic relief would have made the nearly two hours go by so much easier(for me, this merely gets slower and less watchable with each repeated viewing). Attempts at making you laugh fall flat on their faces. There are far more unintentional laughs to be had, at various corny and odd things(why does this have so much weird stuff in it, and why do the people who love it just accept that?). More often than not, to me(and one person I know who *loves* these movies), this just ends up being too hard to take seriously. I'm willing to entertain the theory that Ridley Scott's stuff just isn't for me, I've yet to be amazed by him. For how much sheer, unsynthesized acting talent this has, the players have next to nothing to work with(they do turn in fine performances). Nonetheless, the film does manage to scare me and provide some shocks, even though I've seen this and the other films at least three times before. The film manages to establish a pretty nicely done, spooky atmosphere that lasts for most of the film, despite its shortcomings and the very formulaic ending. The plot isn't bad, and it takes off almost immediately, keeping you fairly interested. The characters are so-so, though there aren't any really startlingly poorly written ones. The creature effects are decent enough, and they do not fail to impress at least a little. The editing has moments that are just strange, the cinematography has reasonably little to offer. Props to whoever ensured that the realism was kept at such a high level. The sets, and in general the production design, is all well-done(some is nothing short of breathtaking). I've read one suggestion that stories set where this is and similar are more straining on the audience, and they are more likely to be bored, in spite of the potential talent possessed by those who put it together... I'm inclined to agree. There is some language, and violence as well as gore is also featured herein. I have to admit, I see this as valuable more as an introduction to the world of the title creature, and find, for example, Cameron's expansion of, and further adventure within, it considerably more worthwhile. Don't expect a masterpiece, and prepare to test your patience, especially if you've seen many of these films. The ""Director's Cut""(though he feels the original fits that bill better... hey, at least it's not as bad as the alternate name, ""Extended Version"", which is even a misnomer as it *shortens* the overall length) adds a few things, which you may find worth a look, if you like it(not that there are that many, I count five chapters with additions in the DVD's own breakdown). The commentary track is an OK enough listen, some of the stuff said is cool to hear. I recommend it to fans of alien-type science fiction, and fans of sci-fi horror films(as such, it's good enough) in general. I suggest any possible Alien-fans to-be to start with this film, rather than any of the other films. The series works best in correct order. 7/10"

","The 1970s are very well known for movies that scared audiences out of their mind. Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" startled audiences with a sophisticated kind of imprisonment whose purpose was to cure when really it could have been used in the next ""Hostel."" ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" frightened audiences with the realization that there is barely escape when in a burning building or a sinking cruise liner. Finally ""The Exorcist"" did the worst, in short, it made every viewer sleep with their light on for the rest of their life. The decade closed off with another sci-fi horror classic, ""Alien.""<br/><br/>""Alien"" is the story of a spaceship crew who is awakened from chronological sleep to investigate a distress signal from a distant planet. After a bad landing, the crew of seven sends a crew of three out onto the surface to investigate. When one crew member, Kane (John Hurt) is lowered into a derelict ship, he is attacked by an alien being that clings to his face. Meanwhile, crew member Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) translates the supposed distress signal into a warning, however, they do not understand why it would be a warning until it's too late. An Alien being is now loose on the ship.<br/><br/>The crew is now faced with a challenge, a loose killer Alien on the ship. They must keep together to stay and alive and make themselves kill or be killed.<br/><br/>Known as a sci-fi horror classic, ""Alien"" isn't all that it's worked up to be. Being in every book of movies that are ""must-sees"" and #51 on the Top 250 would peak anyone's interest, but i can assure you, it's nothing special, just another sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good, classic Sci-fi movie, you'd have a better chance watching the original Star Wars trilogy again or even ""Starship Troopers."" ""Alien"" is nothing more than an entertaining movie. With decent acting, mediocre plot, good directing, and a forgettable twist. I can say that I can only give it an 8 marking it solely on directing and entertainment. If I rated it solely on plot and conflict, it would be 5/10. I'm sorry for anyone that did really enjoy this movie."
"poolandrews","9","4","10","31 July 2005"," The Sci-Fi horror film that set the standard all others have to match.
","Alien starts with the seven crew-members of the huge commercial spaceship the Nostromo being awoken from their sleep. It quickly turns out that the ship's computer named Mother has received a 'transmission of unknown origin' & has woken everyone to investigate. The crew set off in a smaller craft to the planet where the transmission is being sent from, once there Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Kane (John Hurt) & Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) don their spacesuits & go to track the source of the transmission down. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) & the chief science officer Ash (Ian Holm) stay behind & co-ordinate things. Dallas, Kane & Lambert discover an alien ship & inside Kane is lowered into a huge chamber full of eggs one of which opens & a creature attachés itself to his face. Back on board the Nostromo Kane is given medical treatment but the creature cannot be removed & it has acid for blood. Eventually the creature seems to come off by itself & Kane regains consciousness & appears fine. However while eating dinner Kane has a fit as an alien creature bursts out of his chest. The crew decide they must arm themselves & the two engineers Parker (Yaphet Kotto) & Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) manage to come up with some basic weapons, they all quickly discover this alien has grown to an enormous size & is very hostile...<br/><br/>Directed by Ridley Scott Alien really is just about the best of it's type, period. The script by Dan O'Bannon is a little slow to get going by todays standards but I felt this build up is essential as Scott piles on the tension, isolation & mistrust among the crew before they are systematically hunted down by a seemingly invincible killing machine that is the alien. You feel for the characters of which there are only seven during the whole film which makes what happens even more effective. While the pace may be measured Alien is never boring & it provides terrific scary entertainment, even after all this time I think it still manages to be creepy, frightening & very effective at what it sets out to do. Technically Alien is top-notch, a lot of the special effects hold up very well even today next to all the flashy soulless CGI that fill films up. Obviously a few are a little unconvincing but I can easily forgive this, I mean it was made over 25 years ago wasn't it? The production design is great as well, Alien doesn't depict it's spacecraft as sterile white & perfectly clean but as something far more realistic, all the dirt, grime & grated floors that look like a mining ship would. Having said that some of the computer equipment looks a little dated even now which along with the slightly slow pace is my only real complaint. The alien itself was designed by H.R. Giger & looks very impressive, very organic & menacing even though it isn't seen that much it's definitely one of the most memorable of all on screen aliens. Director Scott also manages to use sound & music to good effect, I found Alien quite a quiet film which works well. There isn't much in the way of blood or gore, just that alien bursting out of Hurt's chest. The acting is great from all involved & director Scott manages to retain an air of mystery about who will survive as he gives no obvious indication of a hero type character. Alien is a true classic, the chest-burster scene will live on forever & it's a film everyone should see at least once. Watch it as soon as you can."

","Got to go against everyone here, but another outdated Scott film which left me bored.<br/><br/>It took too long to get going, was very cliched but worst of all had no character to warm to at all. Infact it was probably a collection of every type of negative characteristic in people somewhere in someone in this film.<br/><br/>A good ten minutes of this film is wasted on not one but two scenes of people searching for a cat. After the tedium of that the attempts to scare was usually in the form of a big bang.<br/><br/>Weaver's hardly in it until the last half hour & when she is she comes across as an unconvincing hero(ine). There's little charcter development with her or anyone.<br/><br/>As my concentration wained things became a little confusing. I must've missed the explanation of why there was cat on the ship, or what went on at the end with the 5 minute count down to override the ship (when she was trying to escape). Despite all the ammunition there was a amazing lack of enthusiasm to use the gun & on an alien who we never really got to see that clearly.<br/><br/>I enjoyed 'Sphere' of all films as I got into the plot and could play along with the mystery, so thought I'd give this a go as it was recommended by more than one correspondant. Unfortunately, not only was there no real suspense or horror in this. There was nothing to entice the viewer to engross themselves in the plot.<br/><br/>3/10"

","This is one of those rare cases where the sequel (ONLY the first, mind you) is better than the original.  Alien is, to me, dull, dark, shock-horror, trying to scare you with sudden noises and camera turns.  I sat there waiting for something to happen for most of the film, mostly bored to tears. To me, the only purpose for Alien is as a set up for the far superior Aliens."

","Beautiful cinematography and incredible visual effects can't save a painfully generic and rather mediocre film. I've watched Alien twice, both times causing me to scratch my head in regards to why it is considered to be a classic.<br/><br/>Yes, the poster is cool, the tag-line is cool, the production design is cool, and Sigourney Weaver is obviously really cool. But the movie just isn't. It's an unoriginal slasher film that takes place on a spaceship.<br/><br/>Unlike Mad Max: Fury Road – which also has a minimalist story – the action in Alien doesn't lead anywhere, it just sort of happens periodically. Overall, it feels like a walk through an overproduced haunted house at a county fair. The sets may be realistic but the scares often fall flat."

","Spaceship, crewed by a bunch of mainly chain-smoking second-echelon mediocrities, including a suspiciously eye-rolling automaton, veers off-course in order to visit a creepy planet, for reasons undeniably obscure. One of the crew picks up what could be described as an infection, which then proceeds to knock off all bar one of the rest of the crew, rather like the famous Agatha Christie story about the ten little green bottles, hanging on a wall. The last survivor is a very dishy lady, called Sigourney, who feistily fights the nasty alien, dressed in her scanties, and hugging her moggie, and finally sees him off.<br/><br/>That's it, in effect, and although every effort is made to build up the tension, it just becomes less and less gripping as the film moves towards its predictably triumphant end. I found myself fast-forwarding. That lady is far too attractive to finish by biting the dust with the others. There is no real story, but there was some narrative potential which could have been developed and explored: like what is the true nature of this alien? What is the motivation, the back story, of these dysfunctional space bums? And so on.<br/><br/>There is no doubt at all that Ridley Scott is an exceptionally masterly film-maker. His command of visuals, his ability to get the best out of his actors, and (usually) his sense of pacing, are second to none; but he does need a good basic story, and good writers. Sometimes, but not always, he supplies these necessities himself. Not here.<br/><br/>It astounds me that this film currently sits at #42 on the top 250 list, whereas Blade Runner, one of moviedom's all-time greatest, does not appear until #123."

Most of the critics have it right, and it is very odd that it sits so high on IMDb. It does not deserve its elevated spot, above numerous much better films. It is dropping, however.<br/><br/>Difficult to know how to fill up the requisite ten lines. Ian Holm was good, the way he acted the robot, long before he was revealed to be mechanical. Rather a dodgy feature of the plot, though. Hurt is always good. Sigourney was good in her part. Have I seen her in anything else ? She is supposed to be in Annie Hall, but I didn't notice her. I did also see The Conquest of Paradise, but I can't say I recognized her. The others were run of the mill. They seemed an irritatingly dysfunctional team. <br/><br/>One thing about Ridley is that he's supposed to have been impressed by clunky Stanley Kubrick.

","And so it begins... as vague shapes slowly form the letters... A L I E N. A simple introduction but one suitable given the intensity that follows.<br/><br/>As I watched I realised ALIEN was giving me the most intense and nerve-wracking experience film might ever offer to me - I was frustrated at the sheer tension, the film was succeeding in awakening within me paranoia and anxiety, it kept mounting and mounting, and I kept anticipating and distressing. It was absolutely thrilling - certainly one of the most enjoyable and exciting film experiences I've ever had. If this comment encourages anyone to see the film under the circumstances I did they have struck gold.<br/><br/>The golden guidelines: 1. See the film without any prior knowledge... at all. Even being born in 1992, it is still surprising that I hadn't heard anything about the movie beyond its status of ""brilliant"" and ""terrifying"". And I was lucky in this regard. Everything in the film was a surprise to me, I didn't know anything about the story and the characters, or even the alien. I was familiar only with the poster art – an egg. In a way it was as if I was there watching the film just how people would have seen it in 1979.<br/><br/>2. Night, home-alone, quiet. No distractions.<br/><br/>3. Watch the ""Theatrical Cut"". The Director's Cut is inferior due to the awkward placement of additional scenes that kill the suspense, and the shortening of many scenes that work better with their original lengths.<br/><br/>If anyone reading this has managed to succeed in 1. then BY GOD rent the film now! <br/><br/>Alien is most certainly a masterpiece. A film that is capable of creating such terror in its audience deserves that title. The set designs are brilliant and succeed in setting the atmosphere and creating reality; the work of H. R. Giger is impeccably disturbing and suggestive; and technically, with the exception of one or two shots, Alien has aged gracefully. I look back on my first watch with great fondness, and I remember it vividly.<br/><br/>It would be a shame to not allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying A L I E N and ultimately you won't know unless you try, but I tell you this: It's worth it."
"Otoboke","Null","3","7","1 October 2007"," Suspenseful Sci-Fi Classic
","Alien: a true classic for science fiction and cinema in general. Believe it or not but there are reasons behind the recognition that the film has gained, and I'm going to briefly go over just a few of them here as best as I can.<br/><br/>The plot of Alien is essentially what a reader back in the 70's summarised as being ""'Jaws' in space"". I like to think it's a little more than that, but that's just me. For me, the story of Alien is absolutely flawless, moving along at a near perfect pace from beginning to end, mixing in great twists along the way and finishing off in a memorable set of scenes that send the entire film off in a masterful finale. The script itself is as tight as one could possibly get and although a lot was improvised, the dialogue works in every scene and helps establish, develop and cement characters nicely. Perhaps the very reason why the script works as well as it does it down to the fact that it focuses on just seven characters, taking time to build them up at a balanced rate throughout the course of the film effectively.<br/><br/>It is this great sense of character that allows the viewer to get inside the heads of the crew and experience the terror that they eventually face aboard their ship and in their minds. This is extremely important for 'Alien' because the majority of its horror is predominantly psychological, created through a masterful pacing of suspense that is continually being built up from the very beginning of the story. The character of the Alien itself is also dealt with as well as you could ask, making sure not to develop it too fast, always keeping it some sort of a mystery but at the same time always reaffirming the threat it poses to the crew. The mixture of all these elements is what makes 'Alien' the supreme example of refined atmospheric and psychological horror that it is widely recognised for.<br/><br/>On a technical level, Alien succeeds just as well. Nearly every shot during the film is visually interesting and aurally intriguing. Throughout the movie we are placed within the clinical, claustrophobic and alienated corridors and rooms of the crew's ship. Not only does this help add to the already mounting atmosphere, but it often has you looking around, fascinated or curious as to where these people are and what their surroundings are in relation to them. Essentially, much like Ridley's other major sci-fi epic ""Blade Runner"", 'Alien' has a visual style created through it's photography and lighting that I believe is wonderfully timeless. Sure there are a few visual effects that look a little dated these days, but for the most part everything still works fantastically and probably will do so for quite some time to come.<br/><br/>Performances from the cast are perfect too, with no real stand outs from any because I believe all give their absolute best here and it shows and pays off greatly. Oh, and who can forget that absolutely amazing design for the big guy himself, Alien. Back in the day, this was an absolute masterpiece in 'monster' design, and still is today with the help of the film's great lighting and photography.<br/><br/>These are just a few brief reasons as to why Alien is one of the best films of all time, but hopefully you can understand from them, a little of why and how it was achieved and why I regard this amongst my most favourites of films. This is required watching for everyone, film buff or casual popcorn enthusiast. Get watching and be amazed!"

You really get a feel of how helpless man is if he were to come up against such a creature .<br/><br/>And boy what a creature . I don't think the alien has been surpassed in movie history by a more realistic or terrifying creature . Giger broke the mold when he dreamt this one up . The alien in this movie has a more humanoid look about it than any of the sequels which I think give's it a more psychologically menacing aspect to it . It's Scott's sparing use of the creature due to him not having the budget or huge animatronics team behind him Cameron did that works so well leaving the imagination of the cinema goer to run wild . <br/><br/>The film builds gradually to a crescendo of and ending with great twist's along the way . The casting for the film was perfect and great array of talent on show scott's went for unknowns with ability rather than the established star root . This worked well as it reinforced the impression ordinary people in an extraordinary situation it probably also cut down on cost .<br/><br/>This lead's us to be introduced to the very talented Sigourny Weaver who play's the Riply character to perfection and made her an icon in movie history . <br/><br/>In the age of CGI and high wire's some younger viewers may find it all a little dated but for me when the alien became computerised it lost it's magic and realism and you just did'nt find it scary anymore . <br/><br/>So if you have'nt seen it yet your missing a real treat ."

","Ridley Scott has made two good films,""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"".

Constrained by a comparatively small budget,Mr Scott pushed his and his cast and crew's creativity and ingenuity to the limits.Miss Sigourney Weaver seized the opportunity the part of Lt. Ripley provided her to become a beacon for the empowerment of women. The special effects,although small - scale compared to the likes of ""Star Wars"",are beautifully realised and genuinely shocking. ""Alien"" is a haunted house movie set in deep space,Mr Scott's achievement is in spinning that familiar theme to the extent where its very familiarity is hidden by his smoke and mirrors. Mr.James Cameron's ""Aliens"" is flashier,noisier and more populist,but it is the work of an artisan rather than an artist.You get more bang for your buck but it's movie making by numbers. In ""Alien"" Mr Scott's vision comes to fruition in relative austerity, but it remains his vision and not that of a committee,it is a movie made with the eye of an artist,not that of an accountant."

","I have watched this movie dozens of times, almost as much as Star Wars, and it still scares me. It's scary because it built tension the old way, like Hitchcock did. It's scary because of what it doesn't show you.<br/><br/>I was only in grade school when this came out, and my parents wouldn't let me go to it. I finally saw it on video years later and was totally blown away. One of the best sci fi movies ever, also one of the best horror movies.

"Gravedigger-2","10","3","7","5 November 2000"," A piece of art
","Alien was probably the first really great film that I ever saw. The first time it freaked me out pretty good, but afterwards I knew what an awesome movie it had been. A great blend of science fiction [which I personally dislike] and horror. I taped it off of cable many years later and I realized I had forgotten how good of a movie it was. Let's dissect it, shall we?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Story: Simple, but with a good plot twist and nice resolution. It moves slowly, but it wouldn't have been as good if it moved any faster. I found the end chase scene to be kinda contrieved with Ripley going back to get the damn cat...but oh well...the first hour built up the characters and the tension until the Alien literally burst from Kain's chest and slithered into the dark. Then the Alien would systematically hunt down the crew until one was left...like a slasher film, only better. The ending, while flawed, was very tense with the death almost lurking around every corner until the final confrontation. It essentially uses the first hour to establish the characters, the story, and mood...the second hour is when all hell breaks loose. Slow by today's standards, but it works well.<br/><br/>Direction: Ridley Scott truly turned what could've been a bad move into a piece of absolute art...well except for Ripley going back to get that damn cat! But seriously, the atmosphere is what makes this movie as well as the direction. We never fully see the Alien, which stops it from becoming another cheese-fest with a guy in a suit popping out..Scott truly made one of the most tense movies ever,simply due to the atmosphere, the setting, and some slow direction....speaking of which...<br/><br/>Setting: The idea of chains hanging from everywhere around would make it into all the following Alien films and it works quite well here. The fact that the Alien blends into the dark side parts of the ship make it all the better. <br/><br/>Characters: Well acted and diverse characters all around and an Alien beast. Nuff said.<br/><br/>My last thoughts: I think the best movies are the ones with lots of emotion. In this movie, the emotions happen to be absolute fear and paranoia. The next two sequels were movies I enjoyed a bit more than the original, but all the Alien movies were different because they were made by four different film makers with four different styles and four different stories to tell. Other franchises should take a hint from the Alien series...3 out of 4 were excellent films [with Resurrection being weak compared to the others]...<br/><br/>All in all, if you have two hours to blow and you want to see a good movie that keeps your eyes glued to the scene and doesn't have a loud explosion every two minutes or doesn't have an sensitive back story, this is for you. A must see."

","Anyone who saw Alien before 1985 knows the iconic impact it had on all future sci-fi / horror movies that would follow. It was a creative canon, a standard, by which all subsequent movies would be held against in comparison (even its own sequels). The problem- why I give it 6.8/10? Like all classics, to be viewed by future generations, it cannot remain in a time warp, never to be compared to the future films it inspired or spawned. As my sons watched this movie, they cringed at the special and visual effects, and matte paintings, that for our generation were indistinguishable from a real life, massive set (the artists won Oscars for these masterpiece effects). But for today's generation, the special, visual, and model effects are readily distinguishable, and effectively destroy the film's illusion. My kids could easily point out where the seams to the matte paintings were located. I hate to admit it, but this film's only failing is that it cannot stand up to the newest generation of films, that it brought about."

","I can definitely understand the rating Alien has, however, watching it now, the problem isn't the special effects (they're fine and clearly amazing for their time), rather, the problem is how drawn out the story feels.<br/><br/>It takes around 40 minutes for Alien to start. Before that is a long winded journey of suspense and discovery, then after it finally really starts, there's more of the same at too many parts. For instance, a longer time than necessary is spent looking for the cat (Jones), right before Brett is killed, and that time itself was directly preceded by another sequence filled with too much shadowing.<br/><br/>The pacing wouldn't be such an issue, if at least the suspense was able to live up to it. The coolest part by far is when the parent alien was attached to Kane. It was ominous and appropriately nightmarish. Thereafter, especially given Dallas's constant nonchalance, the film feels, lengthy.<br/><br/>Also, we never really get to fully see the alien in its entirety, and maybe that was by design, but because of the pacing, I found myself needing something in the film to look forward to, and since the story was already a far gone conclusion, it left the spotlight on the alien.<br/><br/>This may seem like a negative review, however, I did enjoy this film, though it lost my full attention at some points due to its near inactivity, or seemingly sedate flow.

The emphasis is never on overt gore or relentless bloodshed (though blood isn't exactly lacking, here), rather it is always placed on the terror of not knowing exactly where the alien is or what it is truly capable of.

"gab-14712","9","2","4","18 October 2017"," Jaws + Space= Alien!
","""Jaws in Space."" The perfect three words to describe 1979's unique Alien. If you look at it closely, Alien is very similar to Jaws. An abnormal giant creature is terrorizing a bunch of innocent humans, and even the introduction to each monster is eerily similar. I really dig the influences that Jaws made on Alien. I liked how they hid the alien until the end, where we finally get to see him in all his grotesque glory. The 1970's was a hard time for sci-fi. Not many science fiction movies were made in the midst of American exploitation films, but luckily Star Wars and Close Encounters changed everything. Because of the success of those films, one of the best sci-fi/horror classics of the twentieth century was able to get produced. I am not much of a horror guy but if you are able to add a science-fiction element to the horror and actually make it good, well you can count me in. I enjoyed nearly everything about this film from start to finish.<br/><br/>One of the film's best strengths is its pacing. It moves purposely at a slow pace. People would expect the movie to be about the alien from the start, but the alien does not begin its reign of terror until the movie has been running for a good amount of time. But we are treated to wonderful characterizations (conversations on money shares), the silence of space, and the anticipation of what will happen next. But from the start, it's worth investing your time into the characters of the ship, The Nostromo. Another strength is the production design thanks in part to designer H.R Geiger. The Nostromo has a wonderful design to it and you can tell the influences from Star Wars. But what about the creature himself? My goodness, they are scary-looking creatures. From the harmless looking chest-burster to the killing machine that is called the Alien, they are visually disgusting creatures (in a good way). In today's day and age of movies, the visual effects still hold up very well. The effects actually won an Oscar.<br/><br/>The Nostromo is a commercial deep-space vessel on its way home when it picks up an SOS signal from a distant planet. The SOS signal awakens the crew from their deep hypersleep way earlier than anticipated, The seven-man crew is led by Dallas (Tom Skerritt) and the rest of the crew consists of Ripley (Signourey Weaver), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Kane (John Hurt), Ash (Ian Holm), and Parker (Yaphet Kotto). Once they get to the signal, they realize that this was not an SOS signal at all. It was a signal of danger now that a very dangerous lifeform is a stowaway on their ship. Will they be able to destroy the alien before they get destroyed themselves? Another reason why the movie works so well is the presence of a strong female lead character. So we have ourselves a 70's rarity: a female-driven science-fiction movie. Signourey Weaver's Ripley plays out like a character straight out of a 1950's movie and I love it. Ripley is a hero worth remembering in future movies. Weaver is the most important character of the movie, but let's not forget about the rest of the cast. I find the ages of everybody interesting. A typical horror or thriller movie has most of their characters between 20-30. Outside of Weaver and Cartwright, everyone is 35 or older. I liked that because they added experience to their characters thus making us care more about their fates. Ian Holm was the oldest cast member at 46, and is the second most important character. His character is actually an android and his profession is a science officer. So you might have the feeling he will play a pivotal role with the alien (and the humans) fates. I must give a shout-out to John Hurt for taking it so well the fate of his character, Kane. Kane happened to be the lucky fellow involved in the horrifying chest-bursting sequence. I've seen this movie several times and the shock value of this scene still remains at a high point.<br/><br/>This movie was directed by Ridley Scott, whom would go on to have an impressive career in Hollywood. But this movie is where he was mostly introduced to the film world. He did one hell of a job directing the movie. This movie could have easily been a movie with cheap scares, but he grounded the movie. He made it much more than just the alien. In a way, you can count this as another similarity to Jaws. That shark movie began the mighty career of Steven Spielberg..just like this film did with Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed Alien so much. This movie spawned many sequels and spin-offs, but none of them impacted me like this movie did although 1986's Aliens is also a classic. The movie is scary and thrilling, but Ridley Scott's powerful directing and Signourey Weaver's acting prowess did much to elevate the movie. Then there was the impressive visuals, the good use of sound (a smooth mixture of silence and Jerry Goldsmith's score), the good script by Dan O'Bannon. This is really an unforgettable classic and its up there with Jaws (yep, I mentioned it again) as my favorite horror movies from the 1970s'. If these kind of films have a good story, then you bet I'll like them.<br/><br/>My Grade: A"

","Director Ridley Scott's well-honed talents of pacing and editing create a tense atmosphere that superbly conveys dread and fear of an unknown, unseen evil entity. In 1979, the technology didn't exist to generate a computer image of a Being from another world, and thank God, because this film would have sucked just like all these post-Alien creature features do. Everyone who loves this movie knows what I'm talking about. Ridley Scott had to be extremely careful not to show a full shot of the Alien, except in very brief scenes, and not to reveal exactly how it moves, because then we would see that it is just some tall, skinny guy in a rubber suit. Nowadays, some computer guy would whip up a really scary-looking, but nevertheless FAKE-looking (yes, computer guys, we can tell) Alien, and the director would not have to even think about trying to breathe life into H.R. Giger's hallucinations to make a successful picture.<br/><br/>The dark, cold beauty of this film will never be equaled."

","When you talk about the greatest science fiction films ever made, you have to at least include the original Alien in the conversation. It spawned an entire franchise, sure, but it also inspired an entire generation of filmmakers that still resonates throughout filmmaking today. It's often imitated, but never duplicated.<br/><br/>I love going back and re-watching this film because it's one of the few horror films I can remember that isn't tarnished upon second viewing. It's always hard to make a film that is just as good the second time around, but it's particularly challenging with horror films. There's something about knowing when each scare is coming and knowing who gets killed off first that usually ruins the fun. However, 1979's Alien is quite the achievement in transcending the ""trapped in a confined space"" genre.<br/><br/>The one thing that always shines through with Alien is Ridley Scott's vision. He's one of those directors that when he's on top of his game, there's no one better at displaying a singular vision for filmmaking. He was certainly inspired by a few sci-fi's that came before like 2001 or maybe even Forbidden Planet, but Alien is its own entity. And boy does it possess one particular entity that scared an entire generation.<br/><br/>Much like the entire film around it, the Xenomorph is a fascinating piece of art. I love H.R. Giger's design. I love its origin. I love that its hidden for half the film. I love that there's actually a human underneath all that terrifying skin. Heck, I love that this thing has two mouths, both just as horrifying as the other. The Xenomorph is as much the star of this film as Sigourney Weaver is, and they both complement each other brilliantly, as strange as that sounds.<br/><br/>But let's talk about Weaver & the crew. If there's ever a memorable crew in one of these space mission films, it's in Alien. And the crazy thing is, you don't necessarily get to know any of them in depth to care about their health and well-being. Most of the film is spent in silence, which makes it all the more powerful when the Alien does attack. Sometime less is more, huh? In its entirety, Alien is one of the greatest films ever made, and easily one of the most memorable. Whether it's the dinner scene, the cat, Weaver kicking a** in her underwear, the reveal with Ash, or just the endless amount of beautiful establishing shots and production design, Alien is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>+Tension<br/><br/>+Scott's vision<br/><br/>+The production design & effects<br/><br/>+Birth of the Xenomorph<br/><br/>10/10"

"The Grand Master","9","2","4","11 August 2015"," Alien has stood the test of time as a science fiction/horror classic.
","In 1979, Alien was released and was a box office hit thanks to Ridley Scott's brilliant direction and a small cast including a little known actress named Sigourney Weaver who would establish herself as one of the most successful actresses in Hollywood. The story is kept simple and there are plenty of non-stop nail biting moments that would be guaranteed to keep audiences on edge and to scare them out of their seats. Alien certainly lives up to its now famous tagline ""In space no one can hear you scream"". The original movie poster is brilliantly kept simple too.<br/><br/>Alien takes place in the near future where a commercial spaceship Nostromo is returning to the earth, intercepts a distress SOS from a distant planet. The seven-member crew of Nostromo is made up of Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), John Hurt (Kane), Ash (Ian Holm), and Parker (Yaphet Kotto). All seven crew members are woken up from their hypersleep and the spaceship subsequently descends on the planet. While exploring the planet, the crew discovers a strange derelict spaceship and thousands of alien eggs. One of the eggs hatches and attacks Kane with a facehugger attaching itself to Kane's face rendering him unconscious. Kane is brought on board Nostromo and the crew depart the unknown planet. The facehugger then disappears and Kane awakens, seemingly fully recovered. All is well until Kane starts to convulse violently during dinner with the crew and a tiny alien bursts from his chest. The crew look on in horror as Kane dies and the alien escapes into the spaceship. The remaining crew members must work together to locate and trap the alien, but it is not as easy as it seems when the alien grows larger and starts killing off the crew members one by one.<br/><br/>Everything is excellent about Alien. Without a doubt this is one of Ridley Scott's best movies besides Blade Runner (1982), Gladiator (2000), and Black Hawk Down (2001). The then-little known cast are excellent and it's great to see Sigourney Weaver go on to enjoy a stellar career. H.R. Geiger's visual effects are excellent (despite being a bit dated now) and it was excellent to see him being rewarded for his efforts with a well deserved Academy Award for visual effects. Jerry Goldsmith's atmospheric soundtrack was also top notch and his brilliant work is sadly missed.<br/><br/>Who would have thought Alien would go on to leave a legacy by following up with three sequels and establishing Sigourney Weaver's Ripley as one of the greatest female action heroes of all time. Aliens (1986) turns everything up to 11 by expanding on the first movie by going bigger, better and louder. Unfortunately Alien 3 (1992) and Alien: Resurrection (1997) fail to reach the same heights as the first two movies.<br/><br/>Alien is a timeless science fiction horror classic that has firmly placed itself as one of the best movies of all time. I still enjoy watching Alien for what it is.<br/><br/>9/10."

The giant Space Jockey pilot alien you see in this film is awesomely impressive. The visionary version of the future and the way this ordinary work crew is organised all feels very authentic. Many similarities to The Abyss and just as visually exciting. The conceptual art is only part of how cool this film is. The casting is impressive too.

"lucasversantvoort","9","2","4","5 May 2015"," Classic Piece of Cinematic Horror
","In 1979, a little film hit theatres. You might have heard of it, it's called Alien. Ever seen it? You probably should. It's pretty good. Seriously, what am I talking about? It's Alien. Everyone has either seen or heard of this movie. Now, I don't see Ridley Scott as the master filmmaker some perceive him to be, but there are times when he got it very right. Alien is one of those times.<br/><br/>In deep space, a ship called the Nostromo carrying mineral ore and seven crewmembers is bound for Earth. The crew are in hypersleep and all is well, that is until the ship's computer registers a signal from a distant planet. The ship has automatically changed its course and awoken the crew. Though no one is particularly excited—everyone assumed they'd be on Earth by now—one of the crewmembers informs them they're contractually bound to investigate any signal. They arrive at the planet. Three of the crewmembers (Kane, Dallas and Lambert) don their suits and head out to explore the planet. They arrive to discover a mysterious spacecraft in the shape of a horseshoe. They enter and eventually discover a large hall with countless eggs all guarded by a force field hovering just above them. Then, one of the eggs opens and a crab-like alien, spewing acid, burns through Kane's helmet and latches onto his face. They bring him back to the Nostromo and the rest is history.<br/><br/>What made this film revolutionary at the time was its brilliant combination of the claustrophobia of space with the concept of a haunted house horror show. A well-executed haunted house thriller is scary enough, but the addition of space means there's literally no escape. It's actually a simple, but really effective concept and Alien executes it to claustrophobic perfection.<br/><br/>Indeed, it's the atmosphere and the handling of the alien itself that makes Alien such a classic. Regarding the alien, Scott and co applied the Jaws principle: refrain from showing the monster completely. What you can't see or understand is the basis of all horror. Because the film deliberately only shows parts of the alien who's often veiled in shadow, it makes him/she/it all the more horrifying. It's telling that one of the deleted scenes featured a full body-shot of the alien crawling towards someone. It looked downright ridiculous. Indeed, the importance of only showing glimpses of the monster in horror films cannot be overstated. It's something Aliens tried to do as well by showing shots of the aliens and quickly cutting away, but alas, you can only show aliens exploding so often before they lose their shock value. The idea of not showing the alien also extends to the script which doesn't explain the origin of the alien, how the spacecraft got there, what the space jockey was doing there, etc. Because we have zero information on it, we can't understand it and because we can't understand it, our imagination kicks in. Sometimes, leaving plot elements unexplained and letting the viewers' minds do all the work is for the better. Also, the atmosphere in Alien is absolutely wonderful. Even by today's standards, this film looks incredible and it was made in 1979with a budget of only 11 million dollars. All three of Alien's sequels have moments where you're subtly aware that something looks fake or was made on a computer screen. In Alien, I can't remember a single moment where the film looked anything less than stunning. Whether it's H.R. Giger's wonderfully disgusting alien design or the ship's interiors, it's all wonderfully realized and immersive.<br/><br/>This film also marked the birth of one of film's most famous action heroines, Ripley. While she would only be recognized as such in Cameron's Aliens, it's interesting to see in retrospect how Alien laid the foundation. What I like the most is that at first, Ripley is just another crew member. Scott doesn't emphasize her as the main character. But when Kane is brought back with a face hugger firmly attached to his thinking cap, Ripley takes center stage by refusing Kane and the others entry back on the ship because it's in violation of protocol. The fact that Ash overrides the door and gives them access anyway, thus ignoring Ripley, is irrelevant. This is the first time Ripley assumes the position of a leader. Her decision might be inhumane, but it's exactly those types of hard decisions that leaders must make. As time goes on and the alien escapes, Ripley starts assuming this role more and more. It's very well done.<br/><br/>Special mention goes to maestro Jerry Goldsmith's score. The production was a troubled one for Goldsmith: some of his music for Freud (1962) was used for the dripping acid scene, a classical piece replaced his end credits music and all but one cue survived the editing process unscathed. Despite all this, the score itself is a classic in the horror genre. Particularly impressive is how 'alien' much of the score sounds, and how much of this is achieved not through electronics, but the skillful manipulation of instruments or the application of real ones. He used actual whistling, an echoplex, wind machines, a didgeridoo, conch shells, a serpent, the list goes on. Despite all this experimentation, Goldsmith still manages to inject the score with some cohesion by carefully applying and manipulating a few themes, the main theme of course being the most recognizable and quasi-romantic. Director Scott however was hesitant to start the film with a broad, but mysterious romantic theme and replaced it with the famous hollow sound that opened the film back in 1979. Goldsmith sought to create a musical journey, while Scott was thinking in individual cues. Both sides of the argument are understandable however.<br/><br/>Alien stands as one of the great achievements in cinematic horror. Not only did it introduce one of film's greatest heroines, but it combined sci-fi, the vast isolation of space and the haunted house concept to produce a singular horror experience."

"Leofwine_draca","10","2","4","17 March 2015"," A masterclass in sci-fi horror filmmaking
","There's no doubt that ALIEN is a classic of the science fiction genre. It's a film that came along at just the right time, proving to be an antidote to the kind of kiddie-friendly sci-fi that was popularised by STAR WARS during the period. While this first film in the long-running series has since been overshadowed by a superior sequel (Jim Cameron's ALIENS, one of the best sci fi/horror/action films ever) and a third film that nearly equalled the highs found here, it's nevertheless a hugely entertaining movie that works thanks to a simple, straightforward plot line that offers maximum terror, all of the time.<br/><br/>One thing it isn't is original. The likes of this go back to the 1950s and earlier. Essentially it's one of those 'old dark house' films of the '30s, transferred to a futuristic spaceship. One film, a '50s B-movie - IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE - has almost exactly the same plot as this film, while Mario Bava's sci-fi outing PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES has the same visual look. Yet ALIEN isn't about originality, just old-fashioned scares executed in a clean, professional manner. This is a film of shadowy corners and dark spaces, of menaces and monsters lurking in air ducts, ready to kill and do worse to you at a moment's notice. It's still terrifying to this day, and the atmosphere is helped no end by an effective soundtrack that includes a beating human heart to up the tension.<br/><br/>Technical qualities are superior and the cast is great. There's a pleasing tendency to kill off random actors regardless of their status which means you can't second-guess who's going to bite it next. Stand-outs include Sigourney Weaver, transforming here from a faceless crew member to a tough heroine, a remarkable progression that carried on into the sequels. Tom Skerritt is perfectly cast as the good-natured captain while Yaphet Kotto steals the show as the hard guy engineer. In fact, all of the cast give excellent turns and a role for Ian Holm early on in his career is a real standout.<br/><br/>Another plus is the scary, sexual design of the alien stuff by H. R. Giger. The facehugger is the stuff of nightmares while the alien itself is probably the pinnacle of man-in-a-rubber-suit technology; there's certainly been nothing scarier than the creature you'll see here. Great pacing, excellent effects, and an underlining realism combine to make ALIEN a genre classic and a film that's been rarely touched by the rip-offs that followed. One for the collection."
"OllieSuave-007","6","2","4","7 March 2015"," An iconic sci-fi movie, but a bit slow.
","Sigourney Weaveer stars in her signature role as Ellen Ripley, who, along with six others in the mining ship Nostromo, were on their way home when they picked an SOS warning from a distant planet. After picking up the signal, the crew realize that a dangerous alien species has stowed away on their ship.<br/><br/>I may be the minority in in this, as I believe this film lacks the excitement and intrigue of its direct sequel, Aliens. Much of the first half of the movie is very slow and any alien action doesn't take place until a good 45-60 minutes in. However, the suspense does build somewhat when the alien is found on board and the crew members struggle to fend it off and survive. I actually saw all the sequels before I've watched the original, so it was interesting to see how the facehuggers, alien impregnation and the very first alien creature were introduced and explained in the movie.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott did do quite a nice job directing, keep the film eerie, dark and foreboding, perfect for a sci-fi movie that takes place in outer-space. Jerry Goldsmith's music score is quite thrilling and Derek Vanlint's cinematography work is brilliant.<br/><br/>Most of the characters were OK in their acting, nothing that blew me away. However, Weaver's performance as Ripley is the highlight of the movie, displaying her fearless and commanding attitude while trying to take control of the ship and take on the alien.<br/><br/>Overall, though, the film thought quite iconic, this film is not as captivating as Aliens and I thought ***spoiler ahead*** the alien creature does not even have much screen time and you can't see it very well ***spoiler ends***. The movie, however, is still worth the watch.<br/><br/>Grade C+"
"hou-3","9","2","4","17 January 2015"," Why is it such a classic?
","After all, surely it is just a haunted house or lost platoon movie taken to the extreme? No, it's much more. In Alien everything works to best effect, and that was not simply luck. In Giger's astonishing alien, cold metallic smoothness is synergised with unmitigated, super-swift killing and intelligent cunning, representing an unprecedentedly fearsome enemy. The bickering relationships among the crew set up an atmosphere of unease and vulnerability that the malign intent of the Company readily exploits. And the descent into chaos and terror is orchestrated with devilish finesse through the brilliant coordination of lighting, music and adroit camera work. For me this is Scott's Citizen Kane - it all falls into place. It is his main claim to greatness."

","As a younger kid, it was ALIENS rather than ALIEN, and though I still love Cameron's ALIENS and its balls to the wall constant action and acid-shed, I have very recently come to love the subtle power that is the first ALIEN. I must first say that much of this adoration comes from the beautifully sinister score by Mr. Goldsmith, and, as I very recently learned, a piece from ""Romance"" by Howard Hanson. This became Ripley's theme of defeating the Alien at the end of the film. But I also love Sigourney Weaver, who will always be Ripley. If they dare to remake this film, I won't go see it. We need to learn to quit ""needing"" to remake everything and accept the classics as they are, products of their time. I am sick to death of CGI. <br/><br/>This film is a real classic, directed by the innovative Ridley Scott, and its cast includes Tom Skerrit as the temperamental and not-so- sensible Capt. Dallas, John Hurt as the tragic Kane, Veronica Cartwright as yes, the weepy but understandably terrified Lambert, Harry Dean Stanton as Brett, a mechanic of few words, Ian Holm as Ash, the science officer, the incomparable Yaphet Kotto as Parker, who was somewhat of a comic relief for a while here, and then went on to an amazing dramatic career, and last but not least, Jonesy (I'm a cat lover, OK?)<br/><br/>The story is simple...a space ""towtruck"" called the Nostromo is ""lured"" by a signal to a small planet to investigate. They wouldn't bother. They are only a commercial civilian vessel after all, but their employers have ordered them to investigate via ""Mother"" their ship's computer. You know the rest, or if you don't, you need to watch this peerless film. Then follow it up with ALIENS. After, you could check out the impeccably acted but disappointing ALIEN 3 (mainly due to the fact that they killed off Michael Biehn! Rackin Frackin critters at 20th Century Fox!!!), and if you have an hour or so to waste, ALIEN: RESURRECTION."

","Jacob's Review: Alien is the first entry to the Alien franchise and so far it is one of the best. The surprising element to me in this film was its pacing. Being raised in an era of film that is so ADD ridden and impatient could influence my thinking ability when it comes to analyzing film but it was so refreshing to see a movie that builds such an eerie and desolate atmosphere. The movie is patient and rather builds tension and character before SNAP and something horrific happens. This is what may dispirit a lot of viewers which is why many people prefer Aliens (1986) to the topic film. It works for me. The characters act like real people and the design, metamorphosis and behaviour of the alien creature is incredibly haunting but left open to interpretation due to the mystery that shrouds the creature (or later known as xenomorph) in its latter stage. If you haven't seen it then I recommend this truly unique gem to those with an attention span. 9/10"

","Alien. The title really says all you need to know. Alien is a science fiction horror film made in 1979 it was very revolutionary and helped mold the modern horror genera and modern sci fi genera. The movie starts by really showing off the sets that were made to stimulate the ship, Nostromo, it all looks amazing more so considering there was no CGI (computer generated images). The movie does start off a bit slow but it's all set up one the crew lands on the planet then the movie really gets going. Ridley Scott, the movie's director, did a marvelous job with suspense. Your always waiting for the next thing to happen and it's very scary. The movie's characters feel a lot like real people, the main character being Ripley. The character of Ripley has now become a pop culture icon and one of the best heroines in any art medium. Alien is also has incredible special effects, most notably chest burster scene were the baby alien pops out of a characters chest, this scene has become an icon of horror, sci fi, and cinema in general. The full grow alien design is another icon in film. It's terrifying and original the Xenomorph (yes it has a name) is easily my favorite movie monster design. So lets wrap this up. Alien has a great haunting atmosphere, good side characters with a great main character, amazing build up of suspense that's able to generate real scares, sets and special effects that are some of the best ever in a movie and all wrapped up with the greatest creature design, Alien gets a 10 out of 10 and at one point it was my number one favorite movie."

"Red-Barracuda","9","2","4","19 August 2012"," First there was Alien...
","I guess in hindsight you can see why Alien was such a sure-fire winner back in 1979. It took important elements of two of the most successful blockbusters of that time. It combined the science fiction of Star Wars with the relentless killer monster of Jaws and put them into a narrative that reflected the cynical anti-corporate feel of many 70's movies. The result was an iconic and brilliantly presented sci-fi horror movie.<br/><br/>Directed by Ridley Scott from a script from Dan O'Bannon, Alien is very intelligently made. None of the cast were stars at the time. This factored into the generation of suspense, as we simply have no idea who will emerge as the hero and who will die - if Charlton Heston was in Alien, for example, you'd have a pretty good idea from the get-go - this casting decision is one that very few subsequent big budget movies have made; to their detriment and to Alien's success. As it was, Sigourney Weaver was the strongest and most capable figure. Apart from a blink-and-you-will-miss-it cameo in Woody Allen's Annie Hall, she hadn't really been in anything before this. Ripley was her calling and she created one of the definitive strong female characters of all time. There are of course other excellent performances from, among others, Ian Holm as the android and John Hurt in the unforgettable role as the first victim.<br/><br/>But as much as anything else, Alien is a triumph of brilliant design work. The looks of the Nostromo and the alien ships are entirely different. Both teams created them in isolation from one another in order to create pure designs 'alien' from one and other. The Nostromo is pleasingly rough, with coffee mugs left lying around etc, it really looks like the kind of place that people live and work. The alien ship and the alien itself are of course the work of surreal artist H. R. Giger. To say that his work is effective would be a gross understatement; the alien itself is a terrifically threatening creation. It's a giant phallic killing machine with jaws within jaws. And this is to say nothing of the eggs, the face-hugger and the chest-buster. Really this is a movie with more creativity than a hundred others."

This movie looks gorgeous. The special affects and the sets are done so well, and that's important because the whole movie takes place on this spaceship. So you got to feel like you're on the ship with the characters. The Alien affects are also great, and won an Oscar for best special affects. Rightfully so.<br/><br/>The actors all do a great job. Especially Sigourney Weaver. She did this movie early in her career, but it's still one of her best performances. You really feel her emotions and her determination when she's on screen.<br/><br/>Last but very not least are the horror elements. The movie has a very dark atmosphere, and the dark corridors of the ship and the setting only add to this. The scenes with the alien are all intense and very affective. Especially the famous chest burst scene. I also think one of the main reasons it's so scary is that it starts of a little slow, but not too slow. It lets your guard down, it builds up, and then it hits you in the face. There are also a lot of moments that catch you off guard, but I'm not going to spoil anything.<br/><br/>This is a perfect horror film, and a perfect science fiction film. Everybody should watch this movie. Get a bunch of your friends, turn off the lights, and turn on the movie. The darkness will add to the claustrophobic setting of being hunted on this vast and dark ship. An as the tagline says,In space, no one can hear you scream."

","¨It's got a wonderful defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it.¨ Ridley Scott has had a great career and made several great films, but Alien, only his second film, may arguably be his best one. In my opinion this is the best horror film of all time due to the dark mood, the claustrophobic atmosphere, and several shocking scenes that continue to have an impact on the horror genre 33 years after its release. I have to admit that I just now got around watching this historic movie after having seen its prequel, Prometheus. I liked Prometheus so much that I knew I had to go back and watch the original film that got the franchise started. Despite having seen the aliens in the horrific AVP films, I still was shocked and surprised with the scenes and effects in Alien. The visual effects were excellent and it rightfully won an Oscar in that department. I can only imagine how shocking the chest bursting scene must have been for viewers in the late 70's. The scene was masterfully directed by Ridley Scott and it has to be one of the most frightening ones in horror history. It may be the highlight of the movie, but there are also several other shocking moments that make this the perfect sci-fi horror film. I loved the way they managed to build the suspense without showing too much of the alien. The setting was just perfect and the sense of claustrophobia is all over the movie. You knew that at any moment the alien could pop out of nowhere and attack once again. That sense of dread was also built thanks to the suspenseful score. Thousands of horror films have tried to copy a similar format since the release of this perfect movie without reaching the same success.<br/><br/>The film takes place sometime in the future as a towing spaceship named Nostromo is on its way back to Earth. There are seven crew members who are in hyper-sleep and aren't expected to wake up until they get home, but unexpectedly the smart computer running the ship, known as ¨Mother, ¨ receives a signal that seems like a distress call from a nearby planet. The crew members are awaken and are informed of the situation by Mother. Despite some initial arguments over them not being a rescue team, the Captain of the vessel, Dallas (Tom Skerritt), decides to land on the planet and once there they discover a wrecked spaceship nearby. Dallas along with his assistant Kane (John Hurt) and crew member Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) get off their ship and enter the wrecked one in search for clues as to who may have sent the distress call while Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Ash (Ian Holm), and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) remain on board of the Nostromo trying to fix some mechanical problems after the rough landing they experienced. Kane, Lambert and Dallas on the other hand discover the fossilized remains of the dead alien pilot on their expedition with a huge hole on his chest. Kane is sent further down the ship where he finds some sort of alien eggs surrounded by a blue mist which seems to be disturbed by his presence. This is where the horror begins as Ripley discovers that the distress call isn't really an SOS call, but a warning.<br/><br/>The film has a perfect structure: the science fiction is beautiful taking us to a futuristic world that is well constructed, the visuals are excellent, the editing perfect, the performances are strong, the script is really well written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett (who later collaborated together for another known sci-fi film: Total Recall), the thrills and scares are plentiful, and there are several shocking moments with a couple of twists. The true star of the film is the alien even though we do not see much of it. The reason he's the star is because the claustrophobic mood of the film makes you dread it can show up at any given moment. These characters are stuck in the spaceship with this evil alien that's killing them off one by one. Not even Sigourney Weaver is the star of this film as she practically gets equal screen time as the rest of the cast. She wasn't a known star at the time, and it was actually this franchise that catapulted her to fame, so no one really knew which characters were really going to survive this horror story as the film had plenty of surprises throughout. I wish I would have been around in 1979 to see what kind of reaction I would of got considering I already have seen the aliens in recent versions, but the fear of the unknown is always much more frightening. I still had a great time with this movie and consider it mandatory viewing for everyone who loves film. Alien is as close to a perfect film as you will ever see.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

","""A mining ship, investigating a suspected SOS, lands on a distant planet. The crew discovers some strange creatures and investigates."" That's the summary of the plot you'll see if you read it on IMDb. But what does that really mean? Well, I could go on and on and on about it, but in short it simply means, one of the best science fiction films of all time. Basically the plot goes as follows; The Commercial Starship Nostromo is en-route back to Earth when the crew is awakened from Hyper-Sleep on orders from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation (who own the ship and employ the crew), to investigate what amounts to be an SOS from a downed Alien Spacecraft. Once the crew touches down on the planet, LV-426, the captain and two supporting crew members venture out into the crashed vessel, and soon a crew member has an alien life form attached to his face, and has to be returned to the ship immediately. After the crew determines that they can do nothing further while on the planet, the ship returns to space and the crew prepare for hyper-sleep again. Also by this time, the crew member with the alien attached to his face has mysteriously recovered and the alien itself seems to have fallen off and died. This proves to be WAY wrong when the true intentions of the creature become clear by way of an Alien bursting out from inside the crewman's chest. In the confusion, the creature gets away into the bowels of the ship, and now let the terror and suspense and the basis for most ""Monster Movies"" for the next 30 years ensue.<br/><br/>Now, one thing that this film does really well is create a feeling of tension and suspense. In every scene in this movie, even in the beginning before anything happens, you're on the edge of your seat because you already know going in that the title of this film is ""Alien"", so that can't be good news for the people in it, and the musical score is already ominous to the point of suggesting that at any moment the whole thing could just hit the fan. I honestly attribute this to the direction of Ridley Scott. The man knows, to this day, just how much to show you in a scene, and that's the key to this film. You don't see that much of the Alien. It's all up to you as the audience to make up for yourself what the creature can do and what it fully looks like. This film has some of the most spectacular film imagery in film history, and it's all thanks to Scott and his editor.<br/><br/>The writing (especially now adays) is really something to talk about. In most creature movies that have come out since Alien, you have a bunch of characters that mean less than zero to the ultimate conclusion of the story, and by the endgame, you just don't care about the last character standing because you're not emotionally invested in them. In Alien, you are absolutely invested in these characters. The script really lends itself to some very interesting, and often times humorous dialog between crew members, (more often than not involving Harry Dean-Stanton and Yaphet Kotto who play the ship's pseudo-mechanics Brett and Parker, respectively); and therefore it's monumental then one of them dies. Something you just don't find in sci-fi anymore, and you should.<br/><br/>Something that really goes hand-in-hand with the writing is the Acting. Everybody is at the top of their form in this film. Sigourney Weaver (in her feature film debut no less) embodies the strength, intelligence and subtle sexuality of the character Ripley. She absolutely IS this character. Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Ian Holm and Veronica Cartwright all hit home runs with their roles as Dallas, Kane, Ash, and Lambert respectively. Again, good acting...something you don't see in sci-fi films like this anymore.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're a fan of sci-fi, suspense thrillers and/or just a fan or Ridley Scott, I highly recommend Alien to you. It's masterfully crafted to be nerve shatteringly suspenseful, and it's one of my favorite films of all time, period. And yes, because it's the inevitable question, I DO love Alien more than Aliens, just so we're clear. In fact, if I had to pick some of the most important films of the past century, the list would include Star Wars, Casablanca, Pulp Fiction and Alien for sure.<br/><br/>10/10 easy."

For this reason, it is the most realistic alien movie of the four. The blood and gore is shocking, the alien moves wonderfully, and the sets look real. The darkness helped hide any flaws in effects for this film.<br/><br/>MUSIC: 9/10<br/><br/>There are no ""songs"" that I would listen to outside of this movie, however the soundtrack fits the movie perfectly and adds to the scariness immensely.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>This is the greatest scary movie ever created. Everything from the design to the music is nearly perfect. The atmosphere in this film is dark and slow, something that present day horror films could learn from. I give it a 9.5/10"
"jackgre99","10","2","4","9 April 2012"," Alien – An Absolutely Amazing Adventure in Another Andromeda
","With this film's much-awaited prequel, 'Prometheus', set for release at the start of this June, I thought that now would be a perfect time to re-visit the fantastic, first-class film that is 'Alien'.<br/><br/>First things first, let's get this out of the way – 'Alien' isn't quite as scary as it was back in 1979. Since then there have been hundreds of horror films which have re-defined what we as a whole consider 'scary'. As much as the classic tag line, ""In space, no-one can hear you scream"" is plastered across the DVD case, whether you're in space or not, no-one will hear you scream. Because you won't be screaming. Nevertheless, there are still some very jumpy moments in the film – the leaping face hugger, and the chest-bursting scene, for instance – but on the whole it isn't what it was.<br/><br/>That's not to say the overall package has declined in quality. Quite the opposite, for, instead of watching this film from behind the sofa, like many seventies folk did, you soak up all the drama, the adamant emotion, and are impressed by a perfect performance by Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This film still grasps onto its incredible mood throughout, bursting with enthralling emotion from start to end. The film starts off with a perfect image of grogginess as the crew members of the deep space mining ship, the Nostromo, awake from hyper-sleep. The crew are woken to investigate a strange signal from a nearby planet. While investigating the signal, they discover it was intended as a warning, and not an SOS. From here on the film bursts with wonderful emotion, hurling a feel of gritty survival and impending doom at the audience, as the crew fall apart.<br/><br/>Now, the film feels retro-futuristic, a seventies' view of the future, and it still gives you that same sense of overwhelming awe, just as Star Wars IV, V and VI still do, even after all these years. As director and writer Ridley Scott's spaceship-of-the-future vision hums by in the vast black wilderness, lit only by the distant twinkling stars, you are left in absolute amazement. What really adds to the incredible feel of this film is how slow-paced it is, how tense, making it uniquely... chilling. Technically brilliant and visually breathtaking, there is not one single moment in this movie that doesn't excel well beyond the usual genre trappings, yet sticks to the original B-Movie plot formula.<br/><br/>Speaking of B-Movies, Alien's production costs were only an estimable estimated eleven million U.S. Dollars, which is just under seven million quid. It may sound a lot of money to you and me, sure, but in terms of films, this is almost unheard of. A film of this calibre made on this budget? Remarkable. Yet despite this setback, the film grossed an incredible $185m, a staggering figure. In comparison, recent horror film, The Thing (2011), on a much greater budget of $35m produced only a measly $17m, despite being okay.<br/><br/>Intelligent, unsettling, and distinctly adult, 'Alien' was part of a series that never lived up to the original, the classic. James Cameron's 'Aliens' was too Hollywood-y, and 'Alien3' and 'Alien- Resurrection' are just plain rubbish. A shame really, simply showing that nobody else will be able to pull off what Ridley Scott did. Not even James Cameron and his fancy crew. 'Prometheus', which is the prequel to 'Alien' is directed by Ridley Scott, which is fantastic news. Who knows? Maybe another classic is on the way..."
"pavlekilibarda-333-623595","10","2","4","1 April 2012"," Brilliant work of high-brow art
","This film matches my taste in art on every level. It is slow, elegant and perverse in a very intellectual way, and is also a movie which addresses the intelligent viewer: one who immerses himself into the detail of the design and script and, of course, who is expected to use his imagination throughout the viewing.<br/><br/>I have shown this film to several of my friends, who were not quite as impressed by it as I was, indeed they yawned and called it boring several times during the very long ""prologue"", so to speak. I was disappointed, but not surprised. Contemporary sci-fi is reduced to a cheap but dynamic story and CGI (of course, there has been a pair of brilliant films in the past ten years, but shoddy is the norm in my opinion). If you are looking for a fast-paced piece with lots of action, this may not be your cup of tea.<br/><br/>On my part, I believe that this film comes as close to perfection as possible: the only ""flaws"" I notice and that occasionally bother me are the effects in some parts, such as the android head and drops of water in the end shot. The volume of the score sometimes seems to be too low for my taste and I believe all of Goldsmith's masterwork should have been used as per his idea. Finally, there is a pair of shots in which I believe a little too much of the Alien has been shown, and I don't really like the way the part of the suit beneath the torso was made. Of course, all of these things are trivial in the big picture, and you probably wouldn't notice them on the first viewing.<br/><br/>And why do I think this is the finest work of art in movie history? I have already said that it engages the viewer in a very discrete fashion. The scene on the alien planet alone should leave you puzzled, but no sooner do we start asking ourselves the first row of questions, the next one has emerged, and so on. For the first-time viewer, the most enthralling question is certainly what the creature looks like and what might we see in the next shot, which for me was an original experience.<br/><br/>The design is probably the finest point of the film. Ron Cobb designed the human element of the film, whereas the great master Giger outdid himself with the alien vessel and creatures. The environment of the alien vessel is the most foreign looking and curious I have ever seen in a movie, and that is not taking into account the many refined sexual themes. The dichotomy of human (functional, wet, sometimes sterile-looking) and alien (dark, massive, uneconomically large and erotic) is why I enjoy watching this work over and over again.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have already mentioned the acting, so I will only mention Ian Holm's performance, which I find to be the finest of the cast. There is relatively little dialogue in the movie, and very laconic at that. This actually allows the atmosphere, score and body-language to come into the foreground - especially in the third act, when the flashing lights, sirens and Mother's voice seem to give an unusually loud and urban tone. The fact that we are aware, as the audience, of this illusion (which somehow comforts the viewer after having witnessed the previous events, and by this time likely being thoroughly horrified) underlines even more aggressively, despite the lights and sounds, the solitude aboard a massive, empty, eerie star freighter.<br/><br/>Of course, the ending is shockingly sublime, with the extract from Howard Hanson's Romantic Symphony providing a wonderful respite from the cathartic ordeal (this is, in fact, the only part of Mr. Scott's tampering with the score that I approve of), and you will probably continue watching till the credits end, dwelling on the most powerful theme of the movie: the vastness, hostility and unthinkable age of the Universe."

Bravo--it is true. This film was victimized by bias against its science fiction genre, garnering awards only in the areas of special effects, set direction, etc. Yes, it features a fearsome creature (brilliantly shown in increasingly frightful glimpses):apparently Oscar voters felt this disqualified the film as a serious piece of cinema. Absurd--""Alien"" deserved nominations, if not wins, as Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Editing, Set Design, Special Effects, Score, and perhaps other categories. I have been a discriminating film-goer for almost 60 years. To this day, ""Alien"" stays with me as one of the most thrilling, satisfying experiences in a theater I've ever had. 32 years later, it has lost none of its impact. Yes--the perfect film!"

","There are many good points of this movie, first of all the script is absolutely great, gripping, original and controversial, full of different twists, some more obvious than others, one of the best scenes of the movie is the one where Ash turns out to be a computer, and the following interviewing scene, a scene that can definitely come up for debate of our curiosity for finding foreign and unknown organisms to explore, are we perhaps too curious and eager? Not something i'm gonna discuss with myself here, but it's an obvious opinion there, and something Ridley Scott may be very interested in exploring more, which he has done already with Blade Runner i guess.<br/><br/>Another strong side, and again, praise to Ridley Scott, the direction of this movie is nearly perfect, i can't find any spots to put my fingers on and criticise, all i can say is that he did a fantastic job creating a atmosphere that stuck to your back, again, some things here have been copied and thus seen before, but it is still one of the best direction i have seen ever, the work with the flickering lights, the many aspects of the image, the, at times, alternative and experimental use of the camera, there are so many good aspects of that, and this movie could have been a lot worse without Ridley in the lead.<br/><br/>The special effects really is the only point that annoyed me a tad, but considering the movie is 1979 and we are now in 2004, i don't think it's something i wanna get into, the monster so to speak wasn't viewed a lot of times, which added to the psychological part of the movie i think, the many silent scenes where you follow the characters is the real backbone of the movie, not the monster, which is good i think, horror movies shouldn't always be focused on what the eye can see, but maybe rather than on what the eye can not see."

Even now, many moments in the film will have you on the edge of your seats with the director bringing suspense to a new level, as well as some iconic movie moments still considered as some of the best ever. The whole film is brought together wonderfully by the acting, especially of Sigourney Weaver, that really put you in their position, and the special effects is also quite amazing for its time. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a stunning film that should keep you entertained throughout, despite its relatively simple plot.

"Artimidor","9","2","4","3 January 2012"," First rate horror, oozing dread and despair
","Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" has easily advanced to the definitive modern day horror classic by hiding the horror rather than showing it, thus appealing primarily to the viewer's imagination and omitting in-the-face special effects. The man in a costume, cheesy must-have in all kinds of sci-fi and horror flicks of the fifties and sixties, still serves his purpose in this film, which however has the advantage of being masterfully directed. ""Alien"" is a perfectly slow paced composition of shadows, noises, musical cues, a film of claustrophobic, tense atmosphere oozing dread and despair, all this creating suspense in the most accomplished Hitchcockian sense: The film provides a scenario where the unknown danger is as unpredictable as it is certain that it does strike.<br/><br/>Aside from its directorial brilliance, ""Alien"" of course also has one of the most innovative monster designs in movie history to offer (H.R. Giger's incredibly beautiful otherworldly creature), another excellent Jerry Goldsmith score, exceptionally strong characters and an outstanding female lead in Sigourney Weaver - and last but not least there's that perfect script, which makes a relatively simple idea into an unforgettable story. Put in three words: First rate horror."

","Now this is how a horror/monster movies should be done, all the new cgi filled rubbish that graces our screens these days are pale imitations of what is a movie of pure mystery, depth, tension, haunting imagery, horrifying score, incredible acting and a movie that is paced to perfection.<br/><br/>The whole feel of the movie is unmatched and leaves you with a cold sense of foreboding but at the same time has you transfixed at the pure mystery of the creature that is before your eyes.<br/><br/>The movies really is a cinematic masterpiece from start to finish. Starting with the opening credits the pace is slow but because of the masterful score by Jerry Goldsmith this only heightens the inevitable terror which is about to unfold.<br/><br/>It's incredible what has sadly happened to the Alien saga when you look back and see that this movies attention to detail from the claustrophobic set designs, a movie score which is unequalled in my opinion, brilliant acting by the whole cast and the most disturbing alien creature design in cinematic history. The creatures mystery has been somewhat destroyed by the Hollywood mess that is Alien vs Predator!<br/><br/>There have been many who tried to recreate the horror of Alien and have failed miserably. James Cameron did a fantastic job in creating the sequel Aliens because he knew not to try and imitate the unique atmosphere, tension and isolation created by Ridley Scott's original and produced another masterpiece in its own right.<br/><br/>Alien works because of its simplicity, it's a haunted house movie in space but the whole concept is so original and horrifying that this is the key to the movies and saga success!"
"hurindeelendar","10","2","4","12 December 2011"," A Gross Masterpiece
","Even though Dan O'Bannon wrote the script (few of which was conserved), this is the unmistakable son of Ridley Scott's finesse as a director and H. R. Giger's psycho sexual, lovecraftian designs. The creature, diluted as it may be today, is still terrifying, inducing the subconscious fears of male rape into the audience. No detail in the ship is left undeveloped, and even if their characters aren't fully developed, the cast certainly give believable performances. Outstanding is Sigourney Weaver as lieutenant Ellen Ripley, one of the first action heroines in celluloid, and Ian Holm as Ash, the scientist and (spoiler) undercover android on board. Unlike most modern horror films, Alien dares to have an atmosphere: minutes pass without the soundtrack daring to alleviate the tension, until a jump scare or truly terrifying outburst of violence erupts. Despite little gore by today standards (the infamously brilliant chest burster scene aside), Alien outmatches them with hidden imagery of sex and death and a brief, yet all-to present allegory at human greed and the stretches corporation will breach for power and money. In space, everyone must accept nihilism and surrender all illusions to stay alive."
"parkergolding","10","2","4","4 October 2011"," An intelligent, deliberately paced exercise in fear
","Alien is a most difficult film to define. In one sense it's a sci-fi film, in another it's a Gothic horror film. Ridley Scott's vision of the future was so intriguing at the time due to its modest implications. The usual sense of humans as infinitesimal in contrast with their universe is there, as is the feeling that one could be engulfed without incident. But for all its cosmic commonalities; Alien is grounded in a sense of realism. This is indicated by the Nostromo, a space Junker operated by eight ragtag crewman, which is a remnant of heavy industry and mass production that is void of the futuristic sheen of fictionalised ships such as the Enterprise, or the Millennium Falcon. Moreover, the crew is representative of the working middle-class; a humble collection of eight crewman whose expertise lies within the most basic provisions of engineering, spare two scientists, these people are the everyday collection that make up our society. Which is why Alien is an exemplary horror film: it deals with ordinary people under extraordinary circumstances – its sci-fi trappings notwithstanding. <br/><br/>Like John Carpenter's minimalist horror film The Thing; Alien is a subtle exercise in tension punctuated by moments of absolute horror. It deals with the venereal and psychological elements of its characters. The Alien is seldom seen, akin to the shark in Jaws, but its presence is always felt. The horror is engendered by its characters rank paranoia, which in turn instils the audience with the same kind of impending dread. The emphasis on the venereal works exceptionally well because it triggers our most basic patterns of instinct and fear. Alien has a distinctly European quality in that it unfolds through the composition of stillness and music. Dialogue is certainly present; however there is an ethereal quality to the proceedings evoking images and sounds that are both chilling and resonant. This is why Alien is such a superior genre film: it takes well established ideas and endeavours into new territory with them.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Alien is a ""B-film"" just as Jaws and the Fly are, but in compounding the formulaic elements with fresh ideas it elevates itself not from its roots, but from people's preconceived views on the genre's limitations. This is particularly apparent in subverting the male-centric heroics in favour of its female lead: Ripley – played with much sincerity and poise by Sigourney Weaver. In fact Ridley Scott discards the film's potentially masculine element so curtly and with such cold precision that he can only really be praised for it. As for the creature itself, Scott was loath to consider having his monster being anything other than terrifying. In defining the aesthetics of the Alien, it is best described as an immensely intimidating figure with a phallic head coupled with a retractable secondary mouth that operates like a dagger coated in translucent goo. But what's more significant is the form it takes. The alien mutates and evolves much like a virus throughout the film and is all the more horrifying for it. Perhaps this was intentional on Scott's part to contrast the perpetually latent paranoia of the characters with the burgeoning senses of the Alien. In any event the Nostromo functions as a proxy for fear and instinct. <br/><br/>The greatest virtue of Alien is the sense of sheer terror it invokes, whether it is through the lens of the cosmos, or in the claustrophobic confines of a spaceship. Like all great films, Alien remains a remarkable achievement and cinematic landmark as it engages the senses and invites discussion from the casual and ardent film goer."

There are seven people in the Nostromo. They soon pick up a signal from distant planet.Rather than make their way back to Earth, the Nostromo crew, which is played by a well known cast including Sigourney Weaver as the control officer on the ship. After leaving the planet, one of the member is attacked by a mutant that basically latches onto your face and stay there. But, what they don't know is that the movie's villain is on the ship. Alien has a great deal in special effects and its set direction is the one I like the most. There are also great shots of scenes involving claustrophobia. But, one of the most famous scenes in the movie is when the member who recovers from being attack by the facehugger and then, he finds out that a chestburster or a parasite is inside of him. This scene is very gory and is not for the faint-hearted. Alien is a great movie because it is like Jaws, or in other words, have a great deal in suspense. The background score is really frightening for those scenes where the Alien pops out. An terrific science fiction thriller. ★★★★ 4 stars."

","'Alien' is a prime example of what happens when many talented people from different walks of life combine ideas and collaborate on a simple, but innovative masterpiece. Its a technological, groundbreaking success on just about every level, playing on the audience's fear of the unknown and what could be waiting in the dark to get us, and it's use of the subconscious element of sexual-resemblance gets under our skin and probes the perverse corners of our imaginations.<br/><br/>Writer Dan O'Bannon concocted the screenplay shortly after being introduced to the genius of Swiss artist/sculptor, H.R. Giger (His horrific visions appear to him in nightmares.), who provided the details, not only for the excellent creature design, but the harsh landscapes, strange spacecrafts, and surreal interior sets. Along comes director, Ridley Scott, whose eye for eeriness and sheer ambiance proves worthy in every frame, and not to mention the tremendously effective score by John Williams supplying even more tension and mood. An experienced cast headed by newcomer at the time, Sigourney Weaver, who ultimately becomes an iconic female fighting force during an unforgettable climatic showdown with the creature is wonderful, and so is Ian Holm as 'Ash', the android who goes haywire. The most memorable scene (and the one that convinced the studios to invest) is the ""chestbursting"" scene, which shocks the viewer, providing the realization that from there on, this is a horror film. This has top-notch special effects that look so convincingly real that it revolutionized the way films are made. I refer to this as the ""original"" terror in outer space, Although gathering many of its ideas from classic films such as 'It, Terror From Beyond Space', this breakthrough in science fiction/horror was followed by more rip-offs and genre clones than any other film in history. Its a breathtaking and historic achievement that will be remembered for all cinematic eternity, and it launched a series of various sequels, making it the landmark introduction to one of the best sagas in the science fiction world. The 2003 Director's Cut Edition is the way to go, featuring the infamous Tom Skerritt cocoon scene."

From beginning till the end, the movie was astounding. Unlike other movies which are made today (which show a lot of gore and are very action packed) Alien is the only alien movie that gives a creepy feeling of ""We are not alone"". Unlike today's movies, they spent the first few minutes only to show us the entire the art-direction of the ship and how it works. Surprisingly enough, all the important scenes take place in these areas. Ridley Scott very cleverly creates the tension, slowly and slowly and a bit fast and a bit more fast and then a bang in the end! I still wonder how the hell they must have created those creatures and that too with extremely higher detail. The story to has a hard solid structures with pretty shocking twists. This movie is not like those non-sense action horror movies where you just watch people dying. Alien is way ahead of even today's film-making. It's a true benchmark like 2001 A space Odyssey.

The vast majority of so-called ""classic"" horror or sci-fi films have a few memorable scenes of genuine shock or terror. ALIEN has easily a dozen. There are many memorable performances in the film, but the the most sublimely effective and WOEFULLY underrated portrayal is by Ian Holm as the sinister android Ash. His sparce, chilling revelation near the film's climax is one of the cinema's MOST harrowing and CAUTIONARY. The languidly operatic score by Jerry Goldsmith is one of his most chilling and evocative. It is a near pitch-perfect match of music to mood. Lastly, we bear witness to the cineastic brilliance of Ridley Scott. His use of bleak, shadowy tones coupled with the claustrophobic back-drop of the film, have etched itself permanently onto our collective unconscious.

One of the BEST tag-lines in cinema: In space, where no one can hear you scream. <br/><br/>The movie begins with the gigantic, mining spaceship Nostromo. It is so Gothic in appearance. It is returning to Earth with twenty million tons of mineral ore. The crew of seven is awaken by the ships computer, MOTHER, and they discover an SOS beacon from a nearby planet. The crew reluctantly launches a rescue ship, the Narcissus, to the planet's surface. They discover the remains of a derelict alien spaceship. One of the crew members, Cain (John Hurt), decides to investigate and finds millions of alien eggs. The old saying ""curiousity killed the cat"" applies here (ironically, there is a mysterious cat named Jones on board with the crew). When Cain startles one of the eggs, a parasite bursts from its cocoon and clings to his face. The rescue team returns to the Nostromo and learns to their horror that the parasite has impregnated Cain with an alien life form. What follows is survival of the fittest for both humans and the alien. <br/><br/>A TOP NOTCH SCIENCE FICTION HORROR CLASSIC.<br/><br/>score: 10/10"
"Woodyanders","10","2","4","18 November 2007"," Why this landmark sci-fi/horror classic still works
","There are several reasons why this remarkably taut, scary and effective science fiction/horror hybrid holds up so well to this very day. 1.) The premise ingeniously mixes elements from two separate, yet compatible genres into a strong and satisfying synthesis. The futuristic outer space setting is pure sci-fi, but the grotesque monster, ghastly gore and spooky mood are sheer gut-wrenching horror all the way. 2.) The plausibly drab and bleak depiction of a frightfully possible future. There's nothing slick or shiny about the future shown in this picture. It's truly grim and grimy, with the grungy set design, grubby costumes and rundown looking spaceship all contributing to one fascinatingly credible version of a future that seems just around the corner. The all-powerful company's cold assessment of the crew as expendable isn't too far removed from the world we currently live in -- a world in which greed and money take precedent over the basic worth ascribed to everyday human life. 3.) The gradual pace. While there are some folks who take issue with the methodically slow pace, said pace nonetheless is crucial to developing the almost unbearably substantial amount of suspense that really kicks into harrowing overdrive once the creature gets lose on the ship. It's the meticulous build-up of the first half which gives the second half of the film its considerable nerve-wracking impact and potency. 4.) The infamous ""chest-burster"" scene. It's so supremely well-timed and staged, with highly believable mixed reactions from everyone involved in the scene. <br/><br/>5.) The uniformly superlative acting from a top-notch cast. Sigourney Weaver positively shines in her break-out star-making role as tough sole survivor Ripley, with stellar support from Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Veronica Cartwright, and the always terrific Harry Dean Stanton. 6.) Jerry Goldsmith's exceptional score. Ace composer Goldsmith chimes in with one of his most brilliantly spare and chilling scores ever. 7.) The thoroughly convincing warts'n'all human characters. The way the well-drawn characters bicker and interact with each other rings completely true throughout. 8.) The strikingly gloomy cinematography by Derek Vanlint gives this feature a supremely powerful dark'n'shadowy atmospheric look. 9.) The still quite sound and cogent special effects. Done prior to CGI, those miniatures have an organic quality to them that's extremely persuasive. 10.) That hideously vile, nasty and downright creepy alien itself. Sure, it's just a guy in a suit, but wow does that suit seem incredibly genuine and lifelike. 11.) Ridley Scott's faultless direction never wavers from start to finish, keeping the absorbing story on track while delivering plenty of jolts and cranking up the clammy claustrophobic tension to the often exhilarating ninth degree. Add all these sterling factors together and the net result is a simply spectacular motion picture that's wholly deserving of its classic status."
"Hashabubba","10","2","4","29 October 2007"," One Of The Greatest Horror Movies In Cinema History
","Not only is Alien a great film, it is was a huge influence to future Si-Fi television and cinema. Before Alien came out the idea of a ""spaceship"" was a very clean and shiny, luxurious hotel in space. However that was all to change, because Ridley Scott's vision of a ""haunted house in space"" changed the way we see spaceships forever. It also gives a great atmosphere and look to the film; which is very important when making a horror movie. <br/><br/>It is truly spine tingling, and a great artistic achievement on every level. The design for the creature itself is genius. And the way it is always hidden in the shadows, so don't see it, makes your imagination fill in the gaps. And that is something that is scarier than any horror film you'll see in your life time.<br/><br/>The whole look and feel to the film is brilliant. It creates a dark, uneasy atmosphere, and Ridley Scott doesn't give us an easy way out."
"John_Q_Citizen","Null","2","4","13 January 2007"," Extremely Creepy Film Brought On by a Scary Atmosphere and Freakish Art Direction
","Let's face it, folks--Ridley Scott is the master in creating an atmosphere to a film. He uses lighting, smoke, sound, music, or whatever else may work to achieve a certain effect. In this case, the atmosphere and starkness of space are used to get the hair on the back of our neck to stand. It sure as hell stands.<br/><br/>The plot to this movie is simple and many films have basically copied it. The crew of a large space barge receive a distress signal to an alien planet. They come down to investigate, and one of the members is attacked by a giant claw that grapples onto your face. He becomes infected with some sort of egg, and in one of the film's most memorable and gruesome moments, a squirrel-sized monster bursts out of his stomach and scurries into the air shafts.<br/><br/>This may be regarded as one of the scariest films of all time--of course, that may depend on who you are. It was certainly scary for me, but then again, I'm not a horror film addict. But this is one of those horror films that I can watch over and over and still be as scared as I was when I first saw it.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, there are only seven real actors in this film. There are only seven characters (ermmm...okay, maybe eight). But, while they are not fully developed characters, I was with them every step of the way. They are truck drivers in space, basically--and I know that term has been used a lot before to describe the movie, but it's true--we sympathize with these people. We feel for them when they die. We feel their fear. The latter is, perhaps, the most successful thing about this film. It relies on tension, suspense, adrenaline, and flat-out fear instead of cheap 'jump' scares to let the movie flow. Of course, with any horror film, there are jump moments. But they are so more effective than any modern horror film that they had me jumping in both delight and shock. What is most effective about these moments is, of course, the build-up.<br/><br/>Ellen Ripley is played with a badass perfection by Sigourney Weaver. How an Oscar has eluded this woman in her glorious career, I will never know. John Hurt plays Kane, the tragic and likable man whose death we will probably never forget once we view this movie. Veronica Cartwright plays Lambert, a shrieking and hysterical woman who is, in many ways, us. She is our logic and convey's our emotions throughout the movie. Tom Skeritt plays the laid-back captain of the Nostromo, the leviathan mining vehicle that floats through space with a silent pulse. Harry Dean Stanton and Yalphet Kotto play the underdecks--two tough guys with their shares on their mind. And of course, who could forget Ian Holm? Truly the most difficult of characters to bring to life. I must admit, when I witnessed the revelation and transformation his character underwent, I was absolutely gobsmacked.<br/><br/>H.R. Geiger must have some pretty nasty things going through his head when he designed the Alien. A strangely beautiful creature that, although scary as hell, was fascinating to look at.<br/><br/>If it wasn't Ridley Scott at the helm of this giant vehicle, I don't think that the film would've been half as good--his auterish and stylized direction is perfect for the mood of the film. Where he places his camera makes it scarier than how any other director (certainly Walter Hill) could've done it. His choice to linger on shots of people entering and exiting rooms brings a strange tension as if making you think, ""God, end this now...""<br/><br/>Overall, this film started a phenomenon.It is one of those classic horror films that only comes along once in a while. Like 'The Shining', it is chalk full of one memorable moment after another. It created and shaped horror films as we see them today."
"Elswet","9","2","4","22 January 2005"," Darkly atmospheric, if not downright terrifying
","I'll start this off by saying that this review is not for the theatrical version, but the extended Director's Cut from the Quadrilogy Collection.<br/><br/>While this movie is some 25 years old, it hardly feels dated at all, aside from the actors appearing so young in comparison to now. Also, aside from ""Gorillas In The Mist,"" this is some of the best work of Sigourney Weaver's career.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott, although relatively new to the cinematic scene at this time with only two theatrical directions under his belt, was prolific in direction through the media of television. While these are two totally different animals, he demonstrated a thorough understanding of the way things should be done. He introduces his characters and builds their development in a nice, easy flow without boring his audience with what can sometimes be a tedious demonstration of humanity.<br/><br/>He introduces his story, gives you a sketchy outline through dialog clever in that it does provide that outline and backdrop of the situation at hand while eluding to what will be coming up, without giving it to you on a silver platter. Obscurity (hiding things in the shadows) is a virtue when building suspense, and he proves with Alien that, even at this early stage of development in his career, he has mastered that phenomenon.<br/><br/>As the tension builds, so the story deepens, providing you with highly suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat moments, and some really good scares, as the story itself is strong enough to draw you in.<br/><br/>The ""monster"" this time is, as the title would indicate, an Alien, but one the likes of which you've never seen. It is intelligent, bestial, brutal, and yet beautiful. The Alien is born of a pod lovingly laid by its Queen Mother, then reborn by way of a warm-blooded host. Reborn pregnant, it immediately seeks to impregnate another warm-blooded host with its spawn, thereby insuring the proliferation of the Alien species. <br/><br/>Very clever writing, dramatic and carefully controlled performances, some excellent effects, and amazing camera work combine to make this a sure sci-fi/horror classic. We knew it would be, as soon as we saw it.<br/><br/>It rates an 9/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"greydor","10","2","4","9 October 2004"," The best ever sci-fi suspense movie ever made
","This has to be the most suspenseful movie I have ever seen. I have seen it advertised or commented on as horror. This is not a horror genre movie. It is sci-fi with an equal amount of suspense. I don't normally watch movies more than once but this one I make an exception for. No matter how many times I have seen it, it still is good. Sigourney Weaver, always a favourite of mine, is at her best and Ian Holmes is hardly recognizable in one of his best performances. Look for Geiger's alien drawings to see the inspirational art work for this movie. The special effects are subtle at times and that's what makes the suspense. I've seen all 4 in the series and this is undoubtably the best one. This is an absolute must see."

","This is the original spacehorrormovie of all times. All the others are no way near as good or well made. This brilliant movie has it all....If you haven't seen this one...it's about time. Only one movie does it credit without being a ripoff( not counting Aliens ) and thats Pitch black starring the( in this movie) awesome Vin Diesel. Its not nearly as cool or horrific but worth a look. I personally hated Alien 3 which is the same movie as Alien without the suspense or excitement about this powerful new monster. Aliens is a different movie all together. This actionpacked-thriller rule action-thrillers. But I don't think you can compare Alien with Aliens. Alien rule above all in space!! See it in the dark."
"dhallen","10","2","4","10 September 2004"," A classic film that withstands the test of time.
","I watched this again recently as part of the Quadrilogy release. This was perhaps the first time all the way through since I missed it in the theaters (I was a newlywed and still in college...no money for movie tickets back then!). I am very impressed with how well this film has stood up over the years. The plot, while basic, does hold the attention of the audience. The acting is superb across the board and each of the actors makes the most out of the roles and clearly differentiates the characters. The special effects are very effective, even though they don't stack up to Star Wars or Close Encounters due to the film's limited budget. It is actually a very good thing that Ridley Scott did not attempt to make the same type of special-effects movie, since the plot, acting, and directing clearly carry the movie without it. In fact, this movie is much better than most movies that rely heavily on special effects, especially those cgi-heavy offerings such as The Hulk, The Matrix, and The Day After that offer nothing but special effects."
"supertom-3","10","2","4","23 July 2004"," One word. Classic!
","One of probably the top five most influential Sci-Fi movies, another being Blade Runner. Both of which were directed by Ridley Scott. Making me wonder why he has not returned to the Sci-Fi genre which is far and away his most successful genre. It can be done, Spielberg returned to Sci-Fi recently with Minority Report too great success. This film is superb, it spawned a genre in itself and is still a big influence. Visually this is only matched by probably Scott's other big Sci-Fi movie Blade Runner. The designs and the sets by HR Geiger are fantastic and Scott more than ably makes them look even better. The film was deservedly a record breaking film when it first came out. The cast are brilliant, the film is surprising and fresh and very tense. Sigourney Weaver does well in her star making role, capturing the screen from her initial supporting part to becoming the centre of the movie to many peoples surprise. Even before people have seen the movie they have probably seen many of the iconic pieces of imagery. I can only add that men will drool over Sigourney's tight skimpy knickers at the end. *****"
"rmax304823","Null","2","4","12 July 2003"," SF ""lost patrol"" movie
","""Alien"" follows the general conventions established by John Ford's ""The Lost Patrol,"" his highly influential 1934 work.  It's been redone any number of times as a war movie or a Western.  Now it's in outer space.  The sub-genre looks something like this.  A small contingent of people -- a mixed group -- in an isolated situation are confronted with a rarely seen enemy who strikes out of the darkness.  There is no way to fight back effectively.  One by one, the group members are picked off, beginning with the leader.  This shifts the responsibility to the next in command, who turns out to be the lone survivor or, sometimes, the last to sacrifice himself or herself for the sake of the mission.<br/><br/>But it's hard to recognize the basic plot under all the gloss.  This movie was something of a shocker on its release, and introduced a lot of innovations into SF movies.  For instance, in all earlier movies in which a team lands on an alien astronomical body there is no wind.  Here, there is a howling gale.  This may not seem like much, stated so baldly, but no one had thought of it before, although it's long been known that planets like Jupiter have atmospheres that are in a state of constant turbulence.<br/><br/>
The monster was also a vehicle for a new, slimier conception of raw evil. This one is no Gill Man or furry pet with teeth.  This thing is positively reptilian in its detestability.  And it doesn't just ""do away"" with its victims.  It begins by incorporating every revolting image from our worst nightmares -- a scaly muscular skate-like creature that plasters itself to John Hurt's face and embeds itself in his innards in order to plant a seed of some sort, which later develops into a juvenile that, in a famous scene, bursts out of Hurt's chest during a shipboard dinner that didn't look very appetizing anyway.  This was the first movie that could really turn one's stomach, what with jelly-like substances and gooey sounds.  Everything connected with the alien looks as if it belongs under a rock in a jungle. The f/x are outstanding.  If they look a little tired today it's only because they've been so often imitated.<br/><br/>The performances are professional all the way down the line.  Sigourney Weaver has a strangely boney face and tiny mouth, but she's believable and turns in a good performance, especially for a Stanford graduate.  Her first name was plucked by her father from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, ""The Great Gatsby,"" one of my faves.  Tom Skerrit isn't around that long, but he is so likably easy-going that we hate to see him disappear from the plot early on. John Hurt is a fine actor.  He was my supporting player in the art-theater classic, ""From the Hip.""  He's never done less than a first-rate job. Whatever happened to him?  Veronica Cartwright exudes vulnerability.  She needs protection as an adult as much as she did when she was a child in ""The Birds.""  In an interview she revealed that when the juvenile creature first appeared everyone laughed at it because it looked so much like a penis. Ian Holm as the robot is suitably cold.  He's a good Shakespearian too. Yaphet Koto is an earthy comforting presence -- while he lasts.  The alien itself doesn't have much screen time but makes the most of it, dripping all over with what looks like saliva.  It reminded me of a boatswain's mate I once had the misfortune to serve under.<br/><br/>There are a couple of curious things that shouldn't get more than footnotes. The music is almost all taken from Howard Hanson, a moody and underrated composer, and effectively evokes distance, darkness, and the mystery associated with them.  There are also a couple of references to Joseph Conrad thrown in (eg., the name of the ship is the Nostromo) for reasons I can't figure out.  Maybe the writers or the director just happened to like Conrad.  It should also be noted that Sigourney Weaver's figure, while not bursting with femininity, is sleek and smooth and looks designed for underwater swimming.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this, you should probably try to.  The gross factor isn't very high, viewed from today's perspective, so if that's what you're looking for, rent Carpenter's regurgitative newer version of ""The Thing"" or something."

","I read a review of this, which said it was dull, overrated and basically awful. The reviewer preferred ""Aliens"". This is a classic example of the bland film tastes of many, (mainly American and British), audiences today. This is a movie which redefined terror, that pushed the limits of set design, that wasn't afraid to make you feel physically ill, at times. We all know the plot by now, (rusty spaceship is summoned to help an abandoned planet, picks up an unwanted alien passenger, and the rest of the plot concerns the crews attempts to escape from it), which makes it both accessible and yet unknowable, expected yet still fresh. If you want a dumb, P.C, ""Oh look, we're being post-modern aren't we clever?"" movie, then watch most of what Hollywood's produced in the past decade. If you want something of quality and substance, watch this. And it was made by an English director! YES!!!"

Its filming style was casual and intimate which brought you right into the atmosphere the characters were experiencing. It was freaky, with strange surprises like Ash the robot.

","I'm a fan of the old Ridley Scott, which was ironically the young Ridley Scott. Back in his youth he made some great films and Alien is one of his crowning achievements. But let's ignore the film for just a second.<br/><br/>You see the Scott Brothers (Ridley and Tony) had a highly visual sense of film-making that used the widescreen frame to its fullest potential. From quite early on they were made best pals of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and they made their reputations with such films like Beverly Hills Cop 2, Blade Runner and Top Gun. In the early 90's their careers briefly faltered and a hack called Michael Bay went into business. Michael Bay ripped off everything he possible could from the Scotts. So much so that in recent years Ridley and Tony have had to exaggerate their style in an effort to distance themselves from this man. The result has been films that look more like agonising, drawn-out epileptic seizures (Man on Fire, Black Hawk Down, Domino) than works of art.<br/><br/>Now let's get back to Alien. A beautifully paced, shot and cut fright machine with perfectly timed scares, meaningful subtext and an iron-grip on the audience. How far removed from the work of the Scott Brothers today. The franchise went to hell in 2004 with the awful Alien vs Predator movie but in its beginning the Alien films were a thing of greatness.<br/><br/>If you can, see the director's cut. I saw this film twice in the cinema (original cut, then director's cut) and while they're both good the director's cut is a bit faster and has a couple real cool extra scenes and shot of the creature. And of course, widescreen is how this film MUST be seen."
"eibon09","Null","2","4","16 November 2001"," Gothic Scifi
","One of ten important science fiction films ever made with a gripping story, suspenseful situtations, sympathetic performances, and excellent artitect. Changed the way filmmakers in Hollywood and around the world saw at how Science Fiction films should be done.  Alien(1979), 2001:A Space Odyssey(1968), and Metropolis(1926) are the three most copied science fiction films since film was born.  Alien(1979) relies on the psychological reactions of the main people of Captain Dallas, Ripley, Lambert, Brett, Kane, Ash, and Parker.  In the order of what is the best to worst I would go with 1.Aliens(1986), 2.Alien(1979), 3.Alien3(1991), and 4.Alien 4(1998).<br/><br/>
The first film is a gothic thriller transported to space.  The designs by HR Giger are a marvel to look at.  Atmosphere and dread are two areas that are the film's strongest points.  Introduced the most famous female figure in a Scifi flick to the person of Ripley.  Early concepts in making the film had Ripley being a man but was changed to make the character a strong but vurnable woman.<br/><br/>Inspiration for Alien(1979) is a combination of three films(It!The Terror from Beyond Space[1958], Planet of the Vampires[1966], and Shivers[1975]) which played an important role in the look, feel, mood, and situations of the film.  British flavored Scifi feature for obvious reasons.  Utilizes the music of Mozart to convey the sense of suspense and terror in the story. Mozart's ""Eline Kleine Nachtmusik"" enforces the cold, expecting, and unknown fear felt in the halls of the Nostromo ship.  There are scenes of chilling horror and anticipating terror within the plot.<br/><br/>Written with a flair for the imagination by Dan O' Bannon.  Filled with brilliant moments like the alien popping out of the chest of Kane, the death of Brett, and the search in the alien ship where one of the crew members discovers piles of eggs.  In the original script there was a sex scene between Captain Dallas and Ripley that ended up not being filmed.  Its too bad such a scene wasn't done because it would have tighten the tension felt in the triangular relationship of Captain Dallas, Ripley, and Lambert. Also, this scene would explain why Lambert has some resentments towards Ripley.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver plays the role that made her into a minor star and jump started her career as a serious female acting performer.  Before she became known as the female Rambo in her performance for the sequel, Aliens(1986). Alien(1979), Blade Runner(1982), and Legend(1984) are Ridley Scott's three film masterpieces of his film life.  Certainly a way superior film than Gladiator(2000).  One film that would be excellent in blending Science Fiction with Horror besides and after Alien(1979) is John Carpenter's The Thing(1982) except with a different appoarch."

","When one brings up the subject on horror movies, your first thought is of the ""Scream,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and the ""Friday the 13th"" series. But then you think a little harder, about the good ones--""The Exorcist,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Poltergeist"" and ""Alien.""<br/><br/>I admit, I have yet to see ""The Exorcist,"" but to this day, ""Alien"" remains the creepiest movie I've ever seen (and when I say 'creepiest,' I mean that it did not leave a lasting sense of fear...it was just 'creepy.'  I still have yet to see a movie that will actually scare the wits out of me).<br/><br/>Nothing prepared me for ""Alien.""  I already knew exactly what was going to happen, and I still found myself in the dilemma of who would live and who would die.  The suspense was incredible, almost unbearable--at the end of the movie, I felt like I was gonna hurl!  Not because of the gore (I've actually got a pretty strong stomach for that), but because of my connection to the characters trapped aboard the monstrous Nostromo.  The feeling of hopelessness, despair, stranded in the middle of nowhere and awaiting the inevitable was so effective, I almost couldn't take it.  The claustrophobic sets (especially the scene with Dallas chasing the alien through the ventilation shafts) and the grisly alien effects, combined with surprisingly good acting from the cast, made this the beginning of a new era in science fiction.  Director Ridley Scott took us where no one had gone before--into the lives of the characters fighting the trauma.<br/><br/>Before anyone died, we got to know each member of the crew.  By the time the baby alien violently burst from John Hurt's chest (and what an amazing scene!  Oh, but don't watch ""Spaceballs"" before watching this...it'll make it seem silly), we actually felt like one of the members standing around him, trying to hold him down, trying to save him but without any luck.  We had gotten a taste of everyone aboard, and every time someone died, we could really feel for them, a feeling of ""It's not fair!""<br/><br/>The slick camera angles were another fairly influential part of the film, somewhat shaky at times but it all adds for effect, especially near the end with Ripley frantically tearing down the tight corridors, steam spewing from all around, blinding her from what's ahead and what's behind.  If only I had seen it in theatres...that would have made it truly haunting.<br/><br/>And a clever trick from Scott...the use of our own imaginations to decide what really happens to each character.  The only person we actually see dying was Kane and the chest-bursting incident, but we only get a glimpse of what happens to everyone else.  We see a bloody Parker, hunched over lifeless later on in the movie,  but we have no clue what happened to him. We saw the alien whip around, grab him and begin a short struggle, with blood pouring from Parker's mouth when all of a sudden, the alien's second mouth shoots out and--where does it go?  Who knows...this isn't even answered in the sequel.  All we know is that it tears into some part of the body and kills them almost instantly.  Personally, I think it grabs the heart (or some other major organ) and rips it out, but that's just me.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott must be among the most talented directors in history.  I can't see a resemblance in his directing between ""Gladiator"" and ""Alien"" (or ""Thelma and Louise"" for that matter) besides stunning sets and stomach-churning gore.  He proves here that he can master the art of film as well as Hitchcock and Kubrick (actually, he combines both their talents in this film).  ""Alien"" will always remain one of the most inventive and influential additions to cinematic history."

","When I was a child, Howard Hawk's ""The Thing, From Another World"" scared the living daylights out of me. It wasn't just the ""creature"" played by James Arness, but the atmosphere, the entire setting. ""Alien"" for me is reminiscent of that. The first time I saw ""Alien"" was on BETA, at home, around 1983 - 1984. I admit, my use of cannabis also played a part in my attentiveness. The atmosphere, the anticipation, was all so reminiscent of ""The Thing,"" that is, what's around the corner. The characters were ""everyday people."" People caught up in a situation not previously encountered but one that would test their survival skills and ability to work as a group to survive an encounter with a humanoid, but alien life species. None were super heroic types, they were just everyday people trying to survive an encounter with an alien lifeform, one that was hostile. Had I seen ""Alien"" at the age I was when I saw ""The Thing,"" the impact would have been just as scaringly profound and impactful. A thrilling horror movie not to be forgotten. Love it still!!"

","I haven't watched it for a while. I don't need to. Every shot, every scene is embossed in my memory. To me, the measure of a truly great film. I first watched it when I was 8 on an old crappy cathode Ray TV (thanks folks, for the tech which made it more real, and the experience) but it scared the bejeesus out of me. Now 43, and I'd still find it scary/unsettling. Ridley Scott pulled off a masterclass here for his first film. Everything. Cinematography, sound, production design, direction, actors, seemingly improv script. It's just out of the ball park. Gold standard movie. Young uns may find the first third 'slow'.

","'Alien' has to be one of the most remarkable alien films ever made - if not the most. Every film of this genre since 1979 was bound to be compared to 'Alien' (just like every shark film since 'Jaws' is being compared to that masterpiece).<br/><br/>The character introductions are so good - and natural - it's been copied in numerous movies since, but never as believable. Here you have seven astronauts who's been together for a while, and that comes across very effectively. The crew members are working together without annoying feuds between them - which became so cliched in later films, and we immediately get a sense of professionalism. I buy every single character, and the casting is also perfect. There are no comic relief characters, and in fact, only the required amount of characters. There are no characters 'just for the kill'.<br/><br/>In a sense, I suppose once could view this as a pre-80s slasher film, but certainly with a lot more substance. 'Alien' has an awesome production design, with spectacular sets. The creature effects are also incredibly realistic. This film still looks so good it's hard to believe it was made over four decades ago. It certainly stood the test of time! 'Alien' revolutionized the sci-fi genre.<br/><br/>'Alien' is just perfect on every level. The acting is very believable. The suspense is nail-biting. The action is fantastic.

It did, and in the process of doing so, create a whole new era of science fiction and, in turn, a far-reaching cultural trend. The ""space truck driver"" design concept led by it was followed by several subsequent works, which almost became the design paradigm of science fiction movies at that time. Its influence was also extended by various forms such as comic books, novels, and even in the field of video games."
"frankde-jong","8","0","0","18 April 2020"," Praise for director Ridley Scott but also for monster designer Hans Ruedi Giger
","In the wake of ""Star Wars"" (1977, George Lucas) Ridley Scott made a science fiction film (his second film) situated in the cosmos. The story however has much in common with ""The thing from another world"" (1951, Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks). Does it really matter if a group of people hunted by an alien life form is locked up in a spaceship (""Alien"") or in an arctic outpost (""The thing from another world"")?<br/><br/>One of the strongest points of ""Alien"" is the design of the monster. This design, a curious mixture of living creature and machine, was made by the Swiss artist Hans Ruedi Giger. Given this fantastic design it must have been a temptation for director Scott to show the monster as much as possible. Fortunately he managed to resist this temptation. Like Jacques Tourneur (""Cat people"", 1942) Scott knew that suggestion can be as scary as explicit images.<br/><br/>In ""Alien"" relatively slow scenes are alternated with rapid action when this is least expected. To be specific I shall describe a couple of (famous) scenes. Unfortunately spoilers could not be entirely avoided in this descriptions.<br/><br/>Scene 1: In the beginning of the film we get acquinted with the crew of the spaceship ""Nostromo"". The director takes time to introduce each crew member. The science fiction degree of the film is somewhat lessened by the ordinary way the crew has breakfast together. All this increases the bond the viewer has with the characters.
Scene 2: The expedition to the abandoned planet
is very beautifully photograped. It takes a long time before the nest with alien aggs is discoverd and out of one of these aggs a creature jumps on a crew member (Kane played by John Hurt) and sticks on his face.
Scene 3: The crew does not know how to remove the creature from the face of Kane. One day the creature has gone. The crew searches the sick bay (suspense) but nothing happens (Hitchcock principle). They only find the dead corps of the creature. This seems to be the end of this storyline but see what happens in ...
Scene 4: Maybe the most (in)famous scene in the film. It turns out that Kane has been iimpregnated by the creature and he gives suddenly birth to the alien. There is a lot of blood iin this ""birth scene"" and because Scott had not told his actors about the details of the special effects not only the viewer but also the actors are (visibly) shocked.
Scene 5: Last but not least the attack on the crew member (Brett played by Harry Dean Stanton) who is looking for the cat of the spaceship. Brett s wandering through the spacecraft when he is surprised by the monster. The spacecraft is very big (it is a commercial vessel, a sort of space truck) and during the opening scene we have been watching how big it really is. Its interiors have an industrial outlook and during this scene there is water dripping from the ceiling. The scene thence gets a sort of Tarkovskian look and feel.<br/><br/>Up till now I have mentioned the design of the monster, the design of the interiors of the spacecraft and the alternation between slow- and action scenes as the gems of the movie. Also the cast is very good. They succeed in creating credible characters and not mere astronauts. Special mention for Sigourney Weaver who plays a rather male like role as officer Ripley. She is formal, detached, status sensitive and in the end the only one to survive."
"limberwillow","Null","0","0","10 July 2004"," Hmm..
","I have to disagree somewhat with the comments by FilmJack3, as I found the original Alien movie to be better than the first. It is slower with less of the in-your-face action, big guns and blowing stuff up. Alien is suspenseful and thrilling, especially towards the end, when Ripley is trying to make it safe to the escape pod, and you never know what corner the creature is gonna pop out from behind. We perhaps see little character development here, but it is a good base to build on for the next three movies, and Weaver does a great job in all of them. There isn't always a need for an explosion around every corner, as there are other ways to provide entertainment, and Ridley Scott proves it here. I was on edge the whole way through, and jumped high every time I thought something was gonna pop out."

Honestly I think the hype of liking the original is only do to it's popularity as a franchise. I'm going to just be honest that I can't join that band wagon, but I'll at least give credit to the special effects and original idea. That's why I would never budge on more than a 5."

"EthanBJones_03","4","3","8","29 May 2017"," Who the heck said this was the scariest movie ever made?
","'ALIEN' was directed by Ridley Scott and stars Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit and John Hurt. When the crew of the Nostromo reach a foreign planet that may contain life, a mysterious life form attaches itself to one of the crew and begins to wreck havoc on the ship.<br/><br/>If you enjoy this movie then I envy you. I genuinely do. I just cannot see the appeal in this movie and would want nothing more than to understand it but I just cannot. Nothing in this movie is particularly frightening, the story is pretty bland and weak and don't get me started on the evil lighting. Not to say I can't see any strengths in the movie. Sigourney Weaver was, to start, really good as Ripley and redefined the movie heroine. To be fair, the majority of the cast did a good job and sold their role. Except for Lambert, Lambert can go to hell. The Xenomorph is also one of the best designed aliens/creatures in movie history and I do congratulate them for holding that title. Despite these revolutionary things that this movie did for cinema, it's just not scary. The number one thing a HORROR movie should be to make me scared or tense or fearful but I just didn't. This isn't down to the effects which are actually good but rather down to the lack real atmosphere or anything to make the movie feel more intense. Again, If you like this movie then I'm happy for you but I just don't see what is so good about it.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the story for this movie is utter stupidity. When some scientists and astronauts, some of the most capable minds on Earth, find an Alien egg on a foreign planet, and their first thought is 'let's stick my face right into it', you know that this movie is god damn stupid. The plot makes literally no sense and its all down to some of Earth's most capable people deliberately breaking rules to keep them alive. That said, I did like the ending and do see it as being genuinely frightening seeing that in cinema's. That said, I think that it meant less to me for the fact I saw it on DVD, and knew how long was less. In addition to that, they do also kind of build up that something will happen without directly saying it, thus ruining the surprise. <br/><br/>Again, I will also compliment the cast for this movie. Pretty much everyone from the wonderful Signourney Weaver to the chilling Ian Holm provided a solid performance and in some ways created the tropes so many Science-Fiction movies would follow today. With the reckless captain, the level headed vice, the crazy scientist - all of that probably derived from this movie and I respect them for that. Now for someone who I couldn't stand in this movie: Veronica Cartwright as Lambert. Screw Lambert. If she died before the script was even written, I would have maybe liked this movie. She was so obnoxious and no annoying and whiny - she puts Temple of Doom's Winnie to SHAME at some points. If that was the point, then fair enough but it doesn't excuse one of the most frustratingly annoying characters I've seen in a long, long time.<br/><br/>Something this movie was praised greatly for was it's 'eerie' and 'tense' cinematography. How? I don't get it? Sure the movie is tightly edited and the camera was steady but I don't see how this movie revolutionised how these movies are filmed. That and the lighting was ridiculous. If you have epilepsy, do NOT watch this movie. Don't even look at the box because that might cause seizures. I respect Ridley Scott immensely and love him as a director but I had to look away from some scenes purely because of the lighting, and I've never had issues with that; my eyes are actually more used to glaring lights so it shouldn't have affected me but I thought I was going blind at points.<br/><br/>A horror movie should be scary, yes? I've always assumed that is what a horror film should do but from the pedestal this movie is placed on, I don't understand why. I was never, at any point in this movie, tense or scared, or even slightly concerned. This is nothing to do with the effects/alien design(which are both pretty good by the way) but more to do with the lack of atmosphere. A lack of atmosphere can make a movie disturbing but I think it just made this movie less enjoyable. This movie's primary directive was to make me scared but I don't think it did that in any way.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I do, to some degree, respect this movie. It revolutionised some aspects of cinema and things like the Xenomorphm, or ship design still echo through the ranks of cinema today. That said, I just couldn't enjoy this movie. I felt no emotion towards any of the characters. I felt so actual care. I just didn't enjoy this movie and it genuinely saddens me to say that because I wanted nothing more than to like these movies. Perhaps I'll enjoy 'Aliens' but I just can't say I recommend this movie.<br/><br/>4/10"

The problem is, the movie takes way too long to get to those scenes. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is boring and empty (and often incoherent). A lot of the movie is poorly lit, between that and obscure shots of the alien and the blinking computer lights and meaningless images on computer screens and technical talk, there were parts where I didn't know or care what was going on.

They grow from embryo to huge monster having nothing to it, deposit eggs that have more flesh than grown monster, and pour rivers of acid and slime. Ah, and they kill :) The genre of the movie (according to IMDb) is Sci-Fi / Horror / Thriller. I'd say it's horror/thriller under sci-fi sauce. Some kind of sci-fi Jaws.

","""Alien"" isn't the masterpiece of horror so many people seem to think it is. The reason is that it has the biggest fault possible for a horror movie: an idiot plot. In any really good horror movie, the characters will fight the monster intelligently and resourcefully; they may be killed anyway, but at least they (and the filmmakers) will gain the respect of the audience. The astronauts in ""Alien"" are utter dorks, and have no idea how to fight the murderous alien. They do not search the Nostromo in large, well-armed parties after the alien flees the dining room. They do not get into their space suits and draw out the air in the ship (or better yet, flood it with cyanide gas, which will kill any carbon-based life, plant or animal). They do not weld bars over the openings of the air shafts when the alien goes there for refuge, making it a harmless prisoner. And on and on it goes, one stupid blunder after another. Real astronauts would have presence of mind in a dangerous situation, but the astronauts in the film have the same problem solving ability as the screenwriter--that is, none at all. Like so many Hollywood movies of the present day, ""Alien"" tries to redeem a poor script with high production values and star power, and achieves only middling results."

Don't get me wrong, he does a fantastic job with all that he does, but he doesn't seem to push the envelope; he does as is expected to get the job done, but not too much else.<br/><br/>That being said, Alien was probably the hardest film to do out of the entire franchise, origin stories always are. Aside from this film, I have only watched the second installment before writing this review so as not to taint my views too much.I think the best thing about 'Alien' is that it left a lot of room to expand and improve.<br/><br/>So on the final report I may say that do to the dry and almost pointless dialog at times and the poor attempts at astonishing us with lots of flashing buttons, as well as 'satisfactory' direction I would give this 5 out of 10 only to add another point for a total of 6 because without this film we may not have seen 'Aliens' or the others to follow.<br/><br/>It's worth watching, especially to study the development of cinema."

This was one of the most creative films ever made. Very few movies before Alien had the same magic that this movie managed to create (Two that come to mind are King Kong (1933) and the original Star Wars). Even though I knew of the chest burster scene before watching this movie (I saw Alien for the first time last year), it still caught me by surprise. The chest burster looked so much more realistic than the one in Alien vs Predator. The characters emotions during this scene, and the rest of the movie, were very realistic.

"ackstasis","9","2","5","1 January 2010"," ""Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility""
","I was recently fortunate enough to experience 'Alien (1979)' at the cinema, and now it's become one of my favourite science-fiction films. That Ridley Scott was partly influenced by Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' is a given. When the Nostromo crew members are exploring the unknown planet in their spacesuits, Scott frames the action so that their space helmets claustrophobically crowd his hand-held camera; in this way, as in the Moon-walk in '2001,' the audience imagines themselves walking alongside these figures. It's this evocation of setting that most impressed me about 'Alien.' Despite a relatively modest budget compared to its sequels, the film does an incredible job of genuinely placing the viewer inside its manufactured reality. For this reason, I may be in the minority in declaring my greatest admiration for Scott's opening act, in which the titular Alien scarcely makes an appearance.<br/><br/>Though the excessive parade of sequels and spin-offs has potentially dampened its impact, the Alien body design by H.R. Giger remains unforgettable. The organism's arachnid-like appendages and movements are given life – and even an astonishing sort of beauty – by the tall, slender frame of Nigerian-born Bolaji Badejo, who portrayed the Alien in most scenes. Additionally, what separates 'Alien' from most inferior ""monster movies"" is a legitimate affection for its own monster. In one scene, the Nostromo's science officer Ash (Ian Holm) confesses an admiration for the creature's evolutionary purity, an instinct for survival ""unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality."" From this perspective, it's very difficult to hate the Alien. Indeed, in the film's climax, when Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) blasts the organism into open space, I even felt an unmistakable pang of regret."

""Alien"" devours mere genres and spits them out!<br/><br/>""Alien"" is as much artist H.R. Giger's film as writers Ronald Shusett's and Dan O'Bannon's (RIP) or director Ridley Scott's or lead Sigourney Weaver's. His designs have influenced modern art (and I mean the best of modern art, not the over-hyped crap!) to an immense degree. The ""alien"" entities human actors confront right in front of them (or fake a reaction to, because all the digital hocus pocus comes much later in computer files) are never pretty.

Do we really want to consider what extra terrestrials in this universe mean for our survival when we haven't exactly solved our petty disputes here on earth?<br/><br/>This film holds up remarkably well due to a cast that are never less than believable and a script which doesn't drop the ball near the end, not following up the intense emotions with schmaltzy sentiment. The compulsively watchable Tom Skeritt, Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton are taking a backseat to Weaver's ""Ripley"", who proves a lady action hero can be smart, tough and sexy without losing her femininity.<br/><br/>I don't really have anything to say about the sequels. Sometimes a franchise is best left unexplored further when you think the original is unbeatable."
"johnmschofield","10","2","5","5 October 2009"," A classic horror film for all times
","This film was made thirty years ago and it is testament to its quality that it still stands the closest of scrutiny. This is because in my mind it is flawless. I remember clearly watching this film for the first time and being enjoyably scared and completely captivated by the events as they unfolded. The persons imagination which dreamed up the alien or maybe dreamed isn't the right word is to be applauded for his or her inventiveness. In fact all of the people involved in this film should be thanked and rightfully very proud of their combined work. As in all great films the feel of this film is just right in every respect, you know you will see an alien but you do not know when or how and the build up to that event is so well done and most people should be able to identify with one or more of the people on the Nostromo and how they react to the threat. The film is high in the IMDb charts but maybe not high enough but that may change over time. The film is a classic science fiction, horror product and for the first time watcher please just relax and take everything in. Alien lasts for a shade under two hours and is atmospheric from the first second to the last."
"alienworlds","Null","2","5","22 August 2009"," an unfinished idea
","I think this is a classic SF flick but that doesn't mean there wasn't room to explore more of what the alien was, as opposed to seeing it rip humans in half type of thing. I think the film is a bit too gory. By further exploration of the alien entity, I mean that nowhere in the film does anyone suggest that what they are seeing is an alien human hybrid. The fact that the alien is found on a derelict vessel, piloted by another type of alien begs the question that if a species had such advanced technology the chances of it being retrieved would be fairly high, so it probably would not even be there, unless the whole thing was a deliberate set up. The idea of the find being a deliberate set up are also never explored by the film maker. We now have many extra solar planets listed in technical books on space. Many of these planets exist in what is called habitation belts. The idea of suggesting where the apparently violent alien hybrid came from is not explored nor is the possible home planet of the alien vessel explored. The idea of extra solar planets is not new. Also the fact the alien that became a alien human hybrid did so after being in a gestation phase for perhaps as long as a million years. That suggest profound cell damages in any extant organism. That idea was not explored. Lots of tension, but I would call it surface tension, as the real deal is the real deal of thinking about what it all means. Well, that is just my opinion. It is an effective film, but perhaps it claims to be thinking mans SF, which it isn't."
"Aaron1375","9","2","5","14 July 2009"," The alien movie that started it all.
","This movie is sort of like another science fiction movie that had the same basic premise from the 50's or 60's, but this one really set off a lot of alien movies and copycats from somewhat good ones, to a whole bunch of bad ones made by the Italians and Roger Corman. Of course, of the alien movies that are in this Alien series my favorite is Aliens as that one was just totally cool. This one though is by far the best horror of the four movies. Has great moments and great atmosphere and has all the elements needed to be a great horror movie. Do not know which I like better though as a horror movie this or John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" both being movies that can show others out there how to make a good horror movie. This one has a mining vessel searching a planet that has what appears to be some sort of alien vessel on it. Writing this review now I can easily see where the video game ""Dead Space"" got a lot of its plot. Well it is not to long that some sort of alien lifeform attaches itself to one of the crew and refuses to let go or to even let anyone tamper with it. That is okay it falls off and dies in a bit and that is where the fun starts. I will not go into how, but now stalking the crew of this mining vessel is one deadly creature capable of killing nice and quickly. There are other parts to the plot, but I do not wish to ruin them for those few out there that have not yet seen this fine flick. The monster is done by costume for the most part and it looks better than any computer monster done these days. So for a complete horror experience try either this movie or The Thing."
"SimonHeide","9","2","5","23 January 2008"," When you are terrified and expendable.
","Sci-fi movies often deals with the theme of survival. Humans in a strange and hostile environment that they are trying to adapt to while they are facing some sort of predatorian enemy. The underlying fear that these stories work around is probably that if we one day will meet intelligent life in outer space what kind of encounter can we then expect? There are many ways to answer this question as we have seen in ""Close encounters of the third kind"", ""Contact"", ""Pitch Black"", ""Stargate"", ""Doom"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Starship Troopers"" to mention a few.<br/><br/>In ""Alien"" we follow the crew on board the cargo vessel ""Nostromo"" as they are returning to Earth with ore. They pick up what at first seems to be an SOS from a planet that they pass. They send out a rescue team and from here on it's a matter of survival.<br/><br/>Many elements come well together in this film; the characters are very well developed and the atmosphere of claustrophobia and desperation is being portrayed with great skill. As others have pointed out the score is truly unique.<br/><br/>The scene where Dallas (Tom Skerrit) dies is in my opinion the one that frightens me the most. He gets into the air-shaft with a flame-thrower in order to chase the alien. The movement-sensors that they use to track the Alien malfunctions and his anxiety, in a very convincing way, slowly gets the best of him until the point where his brain is ""emotionel hijacked"" and he makes a very irrational and fatal move. This scene alone makes the whole movie worth your while.<br/><br/>I saw it again the other day and was a little disappointed in what I would call some minor flaws; That the alien is able to get into the ship is a very unlikely event as I see it. Even though the rescue mission passes quarantine after returning then it is still unbelievable that the crew doesn't detect the alien in Kanes stomach. And the death of Brett is, although the suspense builds up extremely well in this particular instance, still hard to accept as he does the worst thing imaginable; walks alone back to get the cat.<br/><br/>Besides these minor flaws, that none the less irritated me as I would have liked the movie to be flawless, there is nothing I can put my finger on. One thing that makes this film stand out is the pace that it is told in. It is slower than expected but this doesn't make it a boring movie but instead it allows you both to engage yourself in the various details and last but not least it makes all the difference in building up the before mentioned atmosphere.<br/><br/>I would most certainly recommended this movie if the genre in any way appeals to you.<br/><br/>Regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist. If you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews."
"Rautus","10","2","5","28 July 2007"," Sir Ridley Scott's classic sci-fi horror
","This is one of the best sci-fi horror movies I've seen (Predator, The Thing are also two of the best I've seen), the atmosphere of the ship is just brilliant and scary when the Alien is creeping about. The air duct scene is very tense and creepy. Sir Ridley Scott directing is great and gives out some really fantastic suspense scenes. The acting is great, this is the first time we Sigourney Weaver as one of her most famous roles: Ellen Ripley. The plot of the film sees a cargo ship returning to Earth, the crew members wake up from their hyper-sleep and can't wait to go home. While flying through space they pick up a distress signal from a near by planet so they decide to land, the ship gets damaged and they're stuck on the planet, some of the crew decide to check the planet out for anything and soon come across a huge spaceship in the distance, they enter and soon discover a huge skeleton of an Alien life form in the ship with a hole in it's chest, they search deeper into the ship and Kane falls down the hole, in the hole he discovers a room full of Pods, he inspects one of them and it opens then a spider like creature called a Facehugger jumps out and attachés to his face, melting through his helmet. They return to the ship with Kane but Ripley can't allow Kane into the ship because of Quarantine but Ash lets them in. In the medical room they study the Facehugger and learn that it's keeping Kane alive like a host, they try to get it off but it's grip tightens. They then go and try to cuts it's legs off but it's blood spill and melts through the floor since it's blood is acid. After a while they see that the Facehugger as came off Kane, the Facehugger itself is dead. Kane wakes up and they go to have dinner but during it Kane starts to act strange and soon falls on the table then suddenly something bursts through his chest. The Chestbuster then runs off and after a while they go looking for it. Ripley's cat Jones escapes and so one of them has to go look for him because he will be picked up on the tracker as well as the Alien. Searching for Jones suddenly the Alien shows up not small but now fully grown and kills him, they discover that the Alien is moving around through the air ducts so the Captain decides to search the air ducts for the Alien but he is attacked by it. Ripley checks the ships computer and discovers that the company wanted the Alien life form on the chip for their Bio weapons programme and the crew are expendable. Ripley sees Ash next to her and soon he attacks her, the others hurry in and help Ripley and they discover they Ash is a Droid sent by the company to retrieve the Alien, after destroying him they decide that the only way to stop the Alien is to destroy the ship and escaping from the small ship. Getting the air supplies while Ripley goes to the ship they are attacked and killed by the Alien leaving Ripley on her own with it, taking the Flamethrower she goes to self-destruct the ship and on her way out she encounters the Alien and runs. Trying to stop the self-destruct sequence she fails and must escape from the ship. Leaving with her cat Jones she quickly leaves the ship before it self-destructs. She goes to go into her cryogenics tube but suddenly sees that the Alien is in the ship with her, she carefully puts on a spacesuit and takes the harpoon gun then straps herself to the chair and forces the Alien to come out with hot steam, then she presses the button and opens the airlocks then she shoots the Alien and it hangs on the outside then she burns it with the engines finally stopping the Alien then shes goes into hyper-sleep with her cat Jones while her ship flies through space. <br/><br/>Alien is a great sci-fi horror classic that should be seen. 10/10"
"J_Charles","Null","2","5","1 February 2006"," I didn't like it much
","I don't get the enthusiasm for this movie. As of today it's the #62 movie of all time. I found it had some rather dry boring parts that didn't add to the story or to the mood. Cinematography was amateurish. Plot was straightforward without any interesting points to it. No real character development. I just kept waiting for the beast to kill them all. I didn't really care for any of the characters. A suspenseful movie only works when you actually care about what becomes of the main characters and I didn't feel any warmth to this movie at all.<br/><br/>This movie hasn't aged very well either. Looks very 80's-ish. I found Sigourney Weaver's hair to be scarier than the Alien itself."
"siit","9","2","5","21 January 2006"," The benchmark of not only a sci-fi horror, but any movie... period.
","Even after 25 years plus of other movies of this genre being made, Alien does not feel dated. That in itself for sci-fi is an amazing achievement. There are many examples of aliens in movies, and many more of horror and sci-fi. However very few, if any, have amalgamated all successfully and I doubt any would stand the test of time the way Alien has.<br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal and there is no weak link. Each giving an optimal performance that leaves the audience believing them, feeling for them and relating to them. Obviously Sigourney Weaver shines as Ripley, but it would be unfair to single her out as all were impeccable.<br/><br/>The level of technology was believable for a deep-space cargo vessel. It is refreshing to see a piece of junk flying patched up with sticky tape and not let the technology star. It actually lent to character development and add to the overall atmosphere of commercial miners in way over their head, in a place they are not supposed to be, in a situation they are not trained or prepared for. It was all very human and so credible.<br/><br/>The storyline is so simple and Ridley Scott does not try to over complicate aspects of the plot. Instead he concentrates on wringing out atmosphere from every shot whether it is establishing character quirks or the suspense of terror. In my opinion Alien would have to be in the top two Scott's projects to date.<br/><br/>The evolution and cycle of the alien itself is so terrifying it caused me nightmares growing up. Its anatomy, birthing and invincibility coupled with its supreme efficiency in killing is terrifying. It truly is one of the (if not THE) most excellent monster/aliens ever to grace the screen. In this day and age 25 plus years later, the 'Alien' is still nastier than any vampire, werewolf, extra-terrestrial, monster or villain that has come after.<br/><br/>As part of the 'Alien' franchise, this first installment sets the scene perfectly better than any other saga. Alien is not the first of an never-ending straw grasping 'sequals' but the first part of an continuing story (ergo Lord of the Rings 1-3). Alien set the benchmark for sci-fi horror and in 25 years since its first release, it continues to be the example of how not only aliens, horror and sci-fi are to be depicted, but how a movie and story is to be produced."
"ed_metal_head","10","2","5","20 January 2005"," Unbearable Tension and Fear of the Unknown.
","""In space no one can hear you scream.""  So goes the tagline for the film ""Alien"". While the tagline exposes one of the movie's flaws, it also neatly sums up the general feeling of helplessness and claustrophobia that the film achieves.<br/><br/>""Alien"" is set in the future. The crew of a mining space ship are awakened early from their 'hypersleep' by an SOS from a nearby planet. Once on the planet, three of the crew set out to investigate, only to return with an unwelcome visitor (see the title of this film). As the movie progresses, it deals with the dwindling number of crewmembers and their fight for survival.<br/><br/>The plot of ""Alien"" is quite solid. While there is no real excitement or thrills during the first 45 minutes, it still never gets boring. This time is always filled with information for us to absorb, yet we still only know as much as the crew of the ship. When things do start to happen, there are quite a few genuinely shocking moments, with only a few cheap scares. As the movie begins to end, the tension created is almost unbearable, thanks mainly to the excellent set up. An excellent score, which must surely go down as an all time great, aids throughout the movie. The most glaring flaw in the film is that it has sounds in space. Since the film is fiction I would usually have no problem with this, but space noise contradicts the tagline of the movie.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's direction in the film is superb. No one has created such tension and suspense since Alfred Hitchcock. Scott decides to scare us by NOT showing much of the alien. The result is more a fear of the unknown than a fear of the creature.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is beautiful and remains beautiful. Modern films full of the best CGI do not look as good as this film. The models look near perfect, which means that the film will never look dated (except for one scene close to the end that looks poor); whereas, what looks like good CGI now, will look poor in ten years time. The sets used for filming also work well and add to the general feeling of claustrophobia.<br/><br/>Overall ""Alien"" is a fantastic motion picture. It has excellent visuals, direction and a great plot. Also featuring some of the best opening credits ever, it will surely hold up as one of the best films of all time."

Ridley Scott managed to pull this off with style, he got the balance exactly right and the result is terrifying.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver was an inspired selection as the now legendary character 'Ripley' (probably the first female action hero, certainly the best) and the supporting cast are all more than adequate.<br/><br/>I can't deny that this film has dated a little, but when compared to other Sci Fi/Horror movies of the same era, you really can see how awesome this movie is. An undoubted classic that will terrify audiences for decades to come.<br/><br/>9/10 and they may be a little harsh"
"victor7754","10","2","5","16 August 2004"," A horror masterpiece
","Alien blends science fiction and horror creating one of the finest of both genres.  It's design is fabulously shot creating a claustophobic atmosphere of pure tension.  The opening silence is eerily felt.  The films pace is deliberate building up to a blow out ending. The cast seem like they walked out of Harry's bar and grill.  That's a good thing!<br/><br/>Siqourney Weaver is oh so sexy.  Her strong jaw has the strength of ten aliens and when it drops ever so slightly we know humankind will win the war.<br/><br/>Alien plays out like a mystery.  Like Agatha Christie's ""And Then there Were None.""  It's formula is simple: One by one until there are none. The script is simple and could have been turned into a disaster but clever and shrewd minds were at play.  H.G. Giger's Alien creation is scary.  It had to be. It's concept has been mimic and overused and has landed in Hollywoods Greatest Creations. <br/><br/>The creation of Ashe and Ian Holmes performance must be placed in this category as well.  It was one of the greatest plot twists in cinema history. Who knew?  We knew he was odd but who thought the white milk was the essence?  The Ripley/Ashe confrontation was frightening.  The true enemy is the Earth Company. The true enemy is Politics and Business. We are all expendable. ""I say we take our chances in the shuttle and blow the G***D*** thing into space."""
"Snake-666","9","2","5","26 June 2003"," One of the most nerve-wracking films ever made!
","Alien' is possibly the ultimate sci-fi/horror film. Containing everything needed to make a great movie, from excellent special effects to extremely tense moments it is one rollercoaster ride that is not to be missed.<br/><br/>Following a distress call the team of the Nostromo crash land on an uncharted planet. While the ship is repaired an away team is sent to investigate the SOS call and begin to explore an alien vessel. During their exploration one of the team is attacked by an unknown life form which attaches itself to his face. Unfortunately they weren't to know the hell that was about to be unleashed.<br/><br/>What can be said about Alien' that hasn't already been said? Ridley Scott's masterpiece (and still his best film in my opinion) stands out against almost all of the recent sci-fi and horror movies as being possibly one of the greatest movies of the last century! Incredibly atmospheric and delightfully watchable, this movie is a must see for genre fans, and for casual movie fans too!<br/><br/>Scott's direction is superb and very little he has produced since has been able to match his accomplishments with Alien'. Terror and despair are created among the confines of a futuristic space ship without resorting to quick shock scares or unbelievably high volume music. Instead Scott manages to create an exceptionally dark and eerie atmosphere by building up suspense and showing little of the creature that is stalking his characters. Personally I believe that the alien creature is the single most realistic looking alien creature I have ever seen and the beauty of Scott's direction is we have little chance to see any different. The way tension is built is reminiscent of the horror classic Halloween' (1978) directed by John Carpenter, yet contains much more style, flair and general suspense than Carpenter's masterpiece. As in both films the `killer' is not on screen too often and therefore remains a deadly figure of mystery. How can you stop the hunter when you don't even know what it is that's hunting you? Intense and persistent fear are created by Scott in this nerve-wracking movie.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver played her best ever role here in my opinion as Ripley, no role since has she made her own as much as this. From the onset Ripley comes across as a very tough woman but still sensitive enough for the audience to have sympathy and to connect with her. Unlike many `tough chick' roles that become annoying, Weaver became a character that the viewer became attached to, perhaps even became an idol in a way. Her interaction and mannerisms throughout the film were very believable and all this was aided by a beautifully tight script written by Dan O'Bannon. Never have I seen someone play such a believable character in a futuristic (and therefore currently unbelievable) premise. Weaver was also brilliantly complemented by Tom Skerritt who played Dallas. Their on-screen performances with each other were generally quite dramatic and rather intense which blended well to the feel of the movie. These two great performances accompanied by the delightfully wicked and dark performance from Ian Holm as Science Office Ash leads me to think that Alien' has one of the most brilliantly assembled casts in film history. <br/><br/>Alien' is a suspense packed sci-fi/horror thriller which has to be seen to be believed. If you haven't already seen this movie I highly recommend it and its first sequel (Aliens'). Both films have their own unique charm and attraction and it is obvious in my mind why people debate over which one is better. Personally I prefer this great original and feel that it is definitely one of my Top 10 movies of all time. My rating for Alien'  9.5/10."

","""Alien"" is Ridley Scott's acclaimed horror science-fiction film about a killer alien on a spaceship. It features excellent special effects and scenes and a clever use of lighting techniques. Sigourney Weaver is strong as the film's lead and Ian Holm is memorable as the ship's science officer. John Hurt is also in the film as the ship's executive officer, but is underutilized in the role.<br/><br/>Where ""Alien"" suffers is in its story or more appropriately its lack of. Characterization in the film is limited and there is only one interesting twist in the plot, which was enjoyable, but represented only a small part in the film. The story is quite run-of-the-mill and barely developed beyond the fact that there is an alien bent on indiscriminately killing members of the ship's crew. The lack of story development made ""Alien"" seem long and mostly tedious."
"Rforey","3","7","31","3 December 2002"," Analysis of Alien
","The worst part of ALIEN has got to be the appallingly pretentious Freudian psychoanalytical interpretation of the film put forth by Barbara Creed in The Monstrous-Feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis (London, 1993).  The assumption that the fear produced by ALIEN is based upon the fear of the castrating archaic mother is so general it fails to carry any weight.  While instances of maternal separation are seen (the Alien bursts through Kane's body) and the notion of individuality being achieved by these means is an interesting one, the attribution of Freudian philosophy to this film as a whole is a stretch to say the least.  How can one argue against such a sweeping analysis when all other arguments are countered with subconscious motivation?!  The unconscious argument assumes that society as a whole maintains the same subconscious interpretation, a fact I find very hard to believe.  It would also imply some sort of unlevelled genius in the film making process who could transcend consciousness and develop a conscious idea into a subconscious response - again, doubtful on such a scale. Creed's approach also fails to take into account filmic industrial history and the audience's interpretation of the movie.<br/><br/>My interpretation of the fear induced by ALIEN holds with the idea of primordial instinct.  The natural fight-or-flight instinct found in animals when confronted with a predator is masterfully used to create a feeling of fear due to the setting in which ALIEN takes place.  Trapped in a spacecraft, there is no place to hide from the super-predator.  The setting acts as a prison rather than a womb as asserted by Creed.  The appearance of the Alien in such abject terms serves not to equate it with ""monstrous femininity"", but simply to disturb through the abject itself.  While not as repulsive as many other scenes (the eye-cutting scene in Bunuel and Dali's UN CHIEN ANDALOU being the most disturbing filmic scene in my opinion), the image of the Alien is nonetheless unattractive to human emotion in all its puss-filled, slimy glory.<br/><br/>Creed goes on to say that the film deals with the mother's rejection and deception of her children - we find that 'Mother' had been following the robotic science officer's commands all along and had thought of the humans as ""expendable"".  I would add to this argument the role that the company (who the crew are working for) play in deceiving humanity.  It was, after all, the company who sent the crew to their ultimate deaths.  Whether this fact should be interpreted as a commentary on unseen evils or on the soulless and inhumane nature of the corporation, I leave open to debate. However, I would argue that this aspect of the film should be examined further in order to assess the claims of Ridley Scott as auteur.<br/><br/>Personally I did not like the film and am not a great fan of the sci-fi/horror genre.  However, if you are interested in film analysis (and not just necessarily psychoanalysis-as is commonly held with this particular film) then I would urge you to see this film if for no other reason than as a subject of debate.  After that, rent THE SHINING and enjoy the best horror movie ever made."

There are flaws such as quarantine rules for extra vehicular activity but no medical facilities available, just hold in the entrance. What got me most was the cardboard characters, in particular the second woman. I can't even remember her name. She was like a 70s doctor who assistant. When ever anything happened it was classic hands to the face and scream. Life and death situation - just do nothing.The obsession with the cat was also cringe-worthy.

This movie is not terrible by any means, but it's also not as good as everyone says. It's one of those that is built on suspense and suspense only, and if you scare really easy, then I guess you'd really like it. I've seen a hundred movies more suspenseful than this. The ""heartbeat"" rhythm that plays throughout the film adds to the suspense, but not much. Not once did I gasp, jump, or even sit close to the edge of my seat. I watched this movie ten years ago, and forgot the entire thing. Very forgettable story, empty characters, only about ten minutes of the film do you get to even see the alien. I have not seen any of the sequels, perhaps they are better. I don't plan to find out. How is this film rated so high? I guess because it's considered a classic, the outer space version of Jaws, which by the way is no better. My rating, 5/10."

"dondutton","10","2","6","18 June 2005"," arguably the most powerful sci-fi film ever
","Alien is a study in how to construct horror and terror on the screen, from the amazing set design (including the Alien itself), to the portentously threatening visuals of the various death scenes, to the ending. Lieutenant Ripley became an icon in this brilliant work of genius by Ridley Scott. Although the theme of a lethal threat in a closed space killing people one by one is not new, is has never been done better than in this truly original film. Even knowing what will happen and having seen the film before, it is still hard to watch in a way that the computer graphic monsters of Jurassic Park are not. I think this the finest sci-fi horror film ever made. It simply raised the genre to another level."

There have been countless imitations, in both big and low budget projects, in film, literature, music, tv, games (both tabletop and video) and even cartoons.<br/><br/>Although the premise of this film wasn't exactly new it was so brilliantly executed that it's one of the greatest films ever made."
"bankofmarquis","10","1","2","22 February 2020"," A classic that holds up very, very well
","I convinced my cynical 19 year old to watch an ""ancient"" film (her phrase) - so I was careful with my choice. I know she likes horror, so thought I would try to see if she could be scared the old fashioned way and pulled the 1979 Sci-Fi/Horror classic ALIEN off the shelves to show her.<br/><br/>It scared the crap outta her.<br/><br/>Directed by Ridley Scott (more on him later) Alien tells the tale of a working-class deep space vehicle, returning home with a full cargo when they intercept a distress call at a distant, non-descript planet, they go to investigate and...<br/><br/>As told by Ridley Scott, based on a script and story by Dan O'Bannon, Alien is a masterwork in suspense and mood. Scott takes his time telling this story, setting up the feel and atmosphere, showing a gritty, working-man's vessel (and not a sleek silver and chrome shiny ship) where the people inside the craft are not heroes, but working class stiff's just trying to make a buck.<br/><br/>What surprised me this time around seeing this film is how deliberate (some would say slow) that the pacing of this film is - but, darn it all, if it doesn't work. The tension slowly builds so when violence/action happens it explodes and seems all the bigger due to the fact that it is coming out of silence.<br/><br/>The cast - a group of relative unknowns at the time - is stellar. In the DVD commentary, Director Scott said he spent quite a bit of time casting this film to ensure he had the right mix - and his work shows on screen. The 7 actors in this film work well together - and each one of them brings a real character to the screen that is interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Tom Skerrit (the film version of M*A*S*H) as laconic, laid back Captain Dallas and Yaphet Kotto (the villain in the James Bond flick LIVE AND LET DIE) as gruff, looking-for-a-buck mechanic Parker were the most well known of the 7 at the time of the release of the film - and they do bring some star power to the proceedings, but are met, evenly, by others like former child star Veronica Cartwright (Alfred Hitchcock's THE BIRDS), veteran character Actor Harry Dean Stanton ( THE ROSE) and John Hurt (THE ELEPHANT MAN). All 3 bring interesting characters - and faces - to the proceedings.<br/><br/>But...for me 2 the standouts in this cast is IAN HOLM (TIME BANDITS) as Science Officer Ash - a character with some ""quirks"" (to put it mildly) and, of course Sigourney Weaver (GHOSTBUSTERS) in her star making role as 3rd officer Ripley. I don't want to spoil anything in this film, but Weaver's Ripley is the type of strong female character - fighting the typical, chauvinistic male hierarchy - that was heretofore unknown/rarely seen in film and is the prototype of these types of characters to this day. Weaver's performance and the writing and direction of this character is that strong/groundbreaking that it continues to influence writing and filmmaking all these years later.<br/><br/>The 8th character in this film is the look and feel of the ship - the Nostromo - and the look and feel of the titular Alien character as brought to life in an Oscar winning effort in Visual Effects for the team of H.R. Giger, Carlo Rambaldi, Brian Johnson, Nick Allder and Dennis Ayling (based on drawings by Giger). This is truly remarkable, bravura and groundbreaking design and filmmaking - one that holds up very well more than 40 years later - made all the more astounding when you realize that these are all practical effects (CGI had not be invented yet) and the filmmakers had to rely on puppetry, editing, performance and what you don't see (but your mind thinks you do) to fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>It all works tremendously well - if you haven't seen this in awhile, do yourself a favor and watch it again. If you have never seen it, well...you are in for a treat.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A+<br/><br/>10 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

","My first time watching this was at a young age, 9. While ending up having a young crush of ""Sigourney Weaver"", an amazing actress with a beautiful title of ""Sci-Fi Queen"" and still looks beautiful at the age of 70.<br/><br/>This Horror classic is beautifully well done, very amazing details despite it being a 1979 film, still amazes me how well this movie was done. It starts off with a crew in space, with each individual strong characters showing the relationship strengths from the beginning. Plus a female leading character in a horror, sci-fi movie, wasn't done a lot back then. Ridley Scott did an amazing job directing, while choosing the actors and actresses perfectly.<br/><br/>Story outline is very strong, while seems like a simple story ""Outer space signal response crew encountering an alien"" but it's more than just that. You're constantly smiling how close the crew is, laughing some parts, curious about the humanoid, but then having a feeling something more is going on. The whole movie is just beautiful, between the hype, loving the characters (cough, falling for the gorgeous Ripley), and the details of the alien is fantastic, sounds are original, creepy, especially you're outer space.<br/><br/>Outer space is quiet, far from planet earth if anything happens, you're on your own, so the story itself isn't just amazing, the thought of being out there alone is frightening, which brings me to the eerie sounds. Perfectly creepy I must say, offsetting, makes you just fall into a hole sometimes, basically giving you an emotion that they're alone.<br/><br/>Story- 10/10 (Best horror classic, best female leading horror, interesting, very unique designs, very detail, original)<br/><br/>Characters- 10/10 (Everyone is very good at acting, each individual is lovable, strong character bonds, very depth characteristics)<br/><br/>Tone/Music/Atmosphere- 10/10 (Creepy, balanced, good timing, lures you in the situation, eerie)<br/><br/>This is my all time favorite movie, it's beautiful, the best classic, and amazing actors/actresses with an amazing directer Ridley Scott"

"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","1","2","3 January 2020"," One of the most frightening horror masterpieces ever made of all time!
","Alien (1979) is a masterclass of terror it is my favorite Sci-Fi horror movie of all time a real classic. A film so terrifying and yet so beautifully done that it demands to be viewed over and over again. The characters are grounded and feel real, the sets are breathtaking (even today), the film feels natural and plausible. But the main reasons to watch the film are for two things: The Alien and the atmosphere. Both make this film, the entire film is full of dread and when one of the most interesting and violating creatures shows up on screen; it is riveting.<br/><br/>I can still remember when I first saw Alien back in 1997 as a 13 year old kid, It's scared me back then and still holds up today as one of the best horror films of all time. The direction by Ridley Scott is first rate and the sets and atmopshere are creepy and claustrophobic. The ""chestburster"" scene is brilliant and very effective. Also gotta give a shout out to H.R. Giger who designed those amazing Alien creatures. A must own for any sci-fi or horror fan!!<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley is gorgeous and one of my favorite heroine survivors. The ship for Nostramu is great. The effects and desigen for the creature is wonderful great it is a masterpiece fuly done. this is my favorite horror sci-film to me. One of the most frightening horror masterpieces ever made.<br/><br/>I love the characters: Captain Dallas, Ripley, Lambert, Brett, Kane, Ash and Parker. I love the Alien design the costume. Bolaji Badejo as the Alien was great it is really a tragedy and sad because 2 great actors died like Bolaji Badejo and Kevin Peter Hall they both died in the 90's and they both played monster creatures so well. Hall was Predator and Badejo was the Alien they deserve both actors respect and they are missed R.I.P. This was Badejo's only role I wish he would get more movie roles. I miss these actors so much. Veronica Cartwright was great as Lambert I really love her she was sexy. Yaphet Kotto was a bad-ass as Parker. Great practical effect when Parker burn with flamethrower As's remains. That is my favorite scene. Tom Skerritt as Captain Dallas was great and wonderful, his best performance on screen I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The movie is master sci-fi classic masterpiece with a horror elements. My problem is the first hour is boring when the crew goes on the desolate planet and they find that empty ship whith a lot of eggs. One of the crew members gets infected and Ripley does not leave the crew inside the ship but Ash opens the gate and lets them in, he does not obey his superior Ripley. By the end we find out that Ash knew what is going on and he was admiring the purity if the Alien. I love the finale and I love the cat Jones, the cat was really trained. The second hour goes fast around and I was more interested in the second hour. It had horror and survival elements I love that.<br/><br/>On their voyage home, the crew of the deepspace tug Nostromo investigate a transmission from a desolate planet and discover a mysterious lifeform.<br/><br/>Alien (1979) is my favorite horror film, Aliens (1986) is my number 1 favorite horror so I put Aliens (1986) above Alien (1979). To me they are both masterpeices to me. The Nostromo ship is great designed, today the CGI effects are fake, the effects in 1979 were great and excellent."
"valentinpuig","10","1","2","1 January 2020"," A horror sci-fi masterpiece
","Alien is one of those very rare movies I consider to be perfect.
Of course there is no such thing, as you could probably find a few nitpicks here and there. But I personally find nothing in this movie that isn't great.<br/><br/>Everything from the design (H.R Giger outdid himself), sets, cinematography, pacing, characters, and so on, just works perfectly to achieve one of the best (the best ?) horror sci-fi movie of all times.
All those elements work together to bring an incredible atmosphere, sucking you into the Nostromo with its crew, as you follow them dealing with this creature.<br/><br/>I think one of the biggest achievments of this movie, is that everything feels real. The crew feels like real people, the Nostromo feels like a real ship, and even the xenomorph somewhat feels real from a biological point of vue. This makes the movie pretty much timeless, still works 40 years later, and probaby will still work 40 years from now.<br/><br/>It is a must see for all sci-fi and horror fans. And maybe even just movies fans !"

","This year was the 40-year anniversary of the 1979 movie Alien, starring Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, one of the iconic heroes of science-fiction. Being the fake-film-geek-girl I am, it was a movie I hadn't seen until just recently, despite having watched the Alien vs. Predator movies and being familiar with the story through its place in the cultural zeitgeist. Going into the movie, I knew three things: Ripley is the sole survivor, the chest buster scene would happen, and of course, what the final Xenomorph would look like. I didn't know anything.<br/><br/>Alien is a 1979 science-fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott and written by Dan O'Bannon. The film stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto.<br/><br/>We begin with the crew of the commercial space ship Nostromo being awakened from their stasis during a return trip to Earth. Our crew of redshirts is made up of Captain Dallas, Executive Officer Kane, Warrant Officer Ripley (the hero we don't deserve), Navigator Lambert, Science Officer Ash, and two engineers, Parker and Brett (the true heroes of this story). After begin awoken, they realize that they are not actually in their own star system. That's because the ship's computer, Mother, had awoken them early because of a distress signal that they are required to investigate. Otherwise, they would have to forfeit their money.<br/><br/>They land on the moon LV-426 and end up taking damage from the atmosphere and rocky terrain. Parker and Brett repair the ship while Dallas, Kane, and Lambert head out to investigate the signal as Ash looks on from the ship. As they journey, Ripley deciphers part of the transmission and figures out that it isn't a distress call; it's a warning.<br/><br/>From this point on,it gets crazy. The three outside crew members explore an alien ship, and Kane ends up finding a bunch of eggs. While he's leaning over one, it opens, and a facehugger breaks through his helmet and attaches itself to his face. When the crew tries to bring Kane back aboard the Nostromo, Ripley, who is technically in command, says they can't let them in because of the need for a 24-hour quarantine. If only they had listened. Ash overrules Ripley and lets them in, and because of that, the majority of the crew is doomed to death. The facehugger implants an alien baby inside of Kane, and it explodes from his chest during dinner (rude), and the rest is man vs. monster in its purest form.<br/><br/>Watching the film, it struck me that the only people with any sense at all are Parker (Yaphet Kotto), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) and Ripley. All three of them are uncomfortable with the situation. Parker (along with Brett) is already frustrated they are underpaid for their work and isn't interested in sticking their necks out any more. Also, in the book, he agrees with Ripley about the quarantine. Lambert spends most of the trip outside saying that they should term back. She is instantly unnerved, but Dallas and Kane go forward. Not only is Ripley the one who decodes the message and tries to save everyone else, but she is the only one who is suspicious of Ash and paying attention.<br/><br/>When Ripley finally takes over following the death of Dallas, and finds out that Ash has been working with the company to return the alien to Earth; the crew is expendable. That's when we find out that Ash is a robot, and I did not know that and I screamed. That was such a twist, and I had no idea that robots were a normal thing in the Alien franchise. It was so good, and his final line: ""I can't lie to you about your chances, but ... you have my sympathies""? What a dick.<br/><br/>It makes sense that the three of them are the last ones to survive (before it becomes one), because they were the ones most going against the company line. Even Parker, who might have seemed crude at the beginning, dies because he's trying to save Lambert, rather than just taking the shot when he the chance.<br/><br/>I'm not going to bring up Jones, because that cat would have survived them all without any help because he was by far the most capable.<br/><br/>There is something beautifully simplistic about Alien-the practical effects, the design of the alien, and how the tension just keeps ramping up. We spend so little time with the alien onscreen, but we do feel the terror because of its ability to just maneuver easily in the vents, not to mention the inky blackness of it blends into the darkness so that you can't tell it's there until it's too late.<br/><br/>Alien and the character of Ellen Ripley helped change science fiction for the better, and I'm so glad that I finally get the hype. All the twists work out perfectly, and I can tell that watching it again, knowing all the secrets, will only make it more interesting."

"davidmvining","10","1","2","26 November 2019"," One of the great movies
","The title to this movie is so utterly perfect, much like the rest of the film. In terms of straight entertainment, I find Alien to be a pinnacle of tension building terror in film. It's one of the most thoroughly entertaining horror movies ever made. I love Ridley Scott, I call myself a Ridley Scott fanboi, but he hasn't matched Alien in his career since though he's come pretty close.<br/><br/>The Nostromo, a hauling vessel, is pulling tens of millions of tons of ore across the galaxy. It's crew is in suspended animation for the duration of the trip, but their onboard computer, Muthur, wakes them up early when she receives a signal of unknown original coming from a nearby planet. The crew goes down to the surface, investigates, gets an alien organism attached to one of their faces, and come back on board. Famous images happen after the creature on the face lets go and dies and another alien creature bursts forth from the crewmember's chest. The alien grows, killing the crew one by one, until there's only one who escapes.<br/><br/>Okay...plot summary done. There's so much that makes this movie work as well as it does, but I think the best place to start is that title. ""Alien"" implies something from the outside coming in. An alien, in terms of earthly immigration, isn't an alien if they stay in their own country. They become an alien by entering another country. ""Alien"" also implies something strange and different from normal experiences. The alienness of Alien isn't just the fact that we have an extraterrestrial, but that it's coming from the outside and coming in, uninvited, I might add.<br/><br/>The crew feels like a group of siblings. There's no hint of romance between anyone, and they all bicker like brothers and sisters with Dallas (the captain) acting like the eldest brother. Their mother (Muthur) guides them and directs them. It is into this family unit that the outside entity, the xenomorph, gets introduced, but to take the motif and theme further, it manifests in a literal invasion of the crewmember's (Kane's) body. The terror, much like that in The Shining, comes from an external force invading something that should be held free of invasion, a form of a family.<br/><br/>There are a couple of additions to that external pressure to the family unit. Ash, the science officer, we learn later, was added to the crew only two days before their departure from earth. Ash is obviously not really part of the team. He's always just a bit apart and he acts less comfortably in the group than the rest. He's actually an android and he malfunctions in pursuit of his secret mission. Muthur herself is influenced by outside forces, turning her against the crew. She and Ash share the same secret mission, to retrieve the alien at all costs, leaving the crew as expendable. That outside influence perverts the warm cocoon of Muther's room (all soft white lights in the middle of the dark metal grays of the rest of the ship) into something sinister.<br/><br/>The idea of invasion is so complete in the film's packaging of terror and fear. It's pervasive in every instance of how it works. The idea of danger hitting you at home is almost primal, and to see the home of the Nostromo attacked from the outside in so many ways, as well as the bodies of those crewing it, is the foundation of what gives the movie its visceral power.<br/><br/>Those ideas would be nothing, though, if the movie built on them weren't well done, and Alien is a triumph of design. From the lived in and grimy feel of life on the Nostromo (at least partially influenced by the design of Star Wars) to the alien vessel that does a wonderful job of feeling otherworldly, and to the fantastic creature effects that are filmed perfectly to highlight them in just the right ways, Ridley Scott brings a level of sophistication to the visual world that heightens the experience, sells the reality, and deepens the terror. One of the more interesting subtle things Scott does is how he frames the characters. At the beginning, everyone's filmed rather flatly. Ash stands out a bit, but everyone else, especially in the first scene at the dinner table, shows the rest of the crew in the same clarity. No one really stands out, but as the movie goes on, the crew diminishes, and Ripley asserts herself more, she gains more of the frame. There's also the bit where she makes the final plan with three others in the room. For much of the scene, she's the only person in the foreground and everything and everyone behind her is completely out of focus.<br/><br/>I also want to put special focus on the final sequence on the Nostromo from the point Ripley starts the auto-destruct sequence until she leaves on the lifeboat. It's purely an audio and visual assault on the senses, and it works perfectly. Tension is already super high and we get this regular beat of strobes and a loud alarm that just reaches out and grabs the audience. With the alien just around the corner as well, it's one of the greatest audio and visual tour de forces in popular cinema.<br/><br/>Tone is handled pitch perfectly with unease seeping into every scene, and the lighter scenes never really getting that light. Acting is top notch (the Harry Dean Stanton rule definitely applies here). Everything about this movie works just so incredibly well, creating a complete package of terror based on familiar fears in an unfamiliar setting. I consider it one of the great movies."

","The seven passengers of the Nostromo spaceship are awakened from their long sleep by the artificial intelligence, soon discovering that the cause is an unknown signal coming from a planetoid in the region. Forced to temporarily suspend the mission in order to check what the signal was about, the crew uncovers the terrible truth behind this detour. An unseen alien, dangerous and utterly hostile, completely shifts the goal from a peaceful return mission to Earth to a struggle for survival against something whose behavior cannot be predicted, which has no known vulnerabilities and no intention to stop.
This movie does not rely on cheap shock tactics, since even suggesting a great deal of violence, most deaths are not even shown.
It also has a social edge. Earlier in the story, workers argued about working conditions, wages and bonuses, like Newcastle miners in ancient union meetings. They have a sense of the greed of the company they work for. They barely believe the true priority of the mission.
But the point in Alien is not a social message, it's rather taking us away from our reality and transporting us to another world-not our own.
Despite uncountable imitating sequels and the like , Alien has lost none of its power. One of its side purposes is to explore the inner workings of the mind and share it with the spectator. I'm sure there is nothing inherently wrong with escapist entertainment."

","Alien is one film that once you watch it you never will forget it. It begins with the haunting artwork from the late H.R. Giger to the outstanding cast of Tom Skerritt( Dallas), Sigourney Weaver(Ripley), Veronica Cartwright( Lambert), late Harry Dean Stanton(Brett), John Hurt( Kane), Iam Holm(Ash), Yaphet Kotto( Parker) and the excellent performance from the late Bolaji Badejo( Alien). The cast is perfect and the director Ridley Scott delivers a Sy Fy/Horror fright for eternity.<br/><br/>The film begin with the crew of The Nostromo coming back from some off world with mineral ore. They are headed back to Antarctica with so many tons of ore aboard. It is the 22nd century yr 2122 so living in Antarctica could become a reality then? When they think there job is complete, Mother(the ship's communicator)or brain, picks up a distress signal from a remote planet. Ash, The science officer, tells the crew it's an S.O.S., and it must be checked out. The crew is outraged when they find out if they don't they forfeit all their shares. So they land on the remote moon of LV-426. A small group consisting of Kane, Lambert, and Capt. Dallas investigate. The planet is desolate and a crashed ship is there. When they venture inside they explore what looks to be an alien ship. When they investigate further they discover this huge area filled with eggs. Now when Kane decides to investigate one of these eggs, the S**T starts to go south. One of them opens up and attaches to his face. I kid you not it looks like crab-like creature. This is the second stage of the Alien-A Face Hugger. When the crew return they get in, but were suppose to be quarantined. Ash disregarded the protocols and opened the hatch. Kane is in a COMA-like state, but this thing looks like it is helping him stay alive. when Dallas tries to remove it, acid from the thing is released. Ash is really a android, and was sent on this mission at the last minute. So the crew is wondering what will happen to Kane?<br/><br/>Well a couple days later the face hugger detaches itself and Kane just needs to wake up. Now when Ripley goes in to check on Kane, the facehugger is still alive and somewhere in the lab. Ash sees it; and directs it towards Ripley, it drops, but it 's dead it's purpose is over. So Ripley wants it gone, but Ash keeps it to study and admire it.<br/><br/>The next day Kane is awake and is starving, so the crew decides to have one last meal before continuing on home. So they are all setting down for dinner telling each other the first thing they will do when they return home. All of a sudden, it appears Kane is choking. So they all get concerned and help him out, except for Ash who is just observing. The next thing you know Kane is on the table, and something bursts from his chest-Chest burster.( Stage 3) A small alien like creature that comes from Kane. Those looks from the actor's are REAL, according to the cast and director. Everyone wants to kill it right then and there, except Ash, but it's so fast. So a plan is in the works to kill the thing , thinking it will be easy-WRONG. They split in teams, but are unaware the alien has reached Stage 5 shed it's skin and now about 7 feet tall. The crew discovers they are all expendable and Ash is to blame. They do everything in there power to try and kill it, but it's indestructible. One by one the crew falls, until they find out Ash is an android, and may know a way to kill it. There is no way and the shuttle can't hold 3 people, so Ripley, Lambert, and Parker are left. Lambert and Parker go get more fuel on there way the two become prey, and Ripley is the only one left. She has a plan so she decides to destroy the ship and work her way to the shuttle. On her way there she has a few run in with the Xenomorph , but is able to get aboard. Once aboard the thing is hidden in there with her. So she plays it smooth, gets a spacesuit on open the outer door and blasts the thing in outer space. In the end she is safe and sound in her sleep chamber set for home. A great movie you will never forget."

","Alien is a masterpiece of horror and science fiction. Ridley Scott made a film for the ages that sprouted many sequels and a whole industry in itself but it is nice to see how simple the first film is executed. Alien is a perfect example of a director gradually elevating the level of energy and anticipation in a motion picture. The way Scott meticulously raises the sense of menace and tension is worthy of Hitchcock. This atmosphere-soaked production relies on the viewer's imagination to enhance the alien's nightmarishness. Scott carefully restricts how much we see of the creature - there's enough to provide our minds with horrifying images, but not so much that the illusion is spoiled. Alien contains its fair share of genuine scares. These aren't mere ""boo"" moments, where something benign jumps out of the shadows accompanied by a loud noise and a musical crescendo, but legitimate shocks. The first occurs when the face-hugger leaps out of the egg and attaches itself to Kane. The second is when the alien explodes through Kane's chest. Then, during the hunt for the alien, there are numerous others."

"mrdinapoli","10","1","2","17 September 2019"," STILL THE BEST
","Alien is an un-aging classic, and is one of the, if not the best, Sci-Fi and horror movies of all time - possibly even one of the best of all movies of all time. I saw this movie when it first came out - I was 14 yr old, and had to sneak a peak when my parents were asleep. A great and scary movie because it was so realistic and believable. I have seen it many times since, and am watching it now (Sept 2019), a full 40 YEARS later. Even after a significant science-based education and seeing many Sci-Fi films over the years, I am amazed at the realism and sense of horror and fear that it still conveys, even despite its age. The technology and special effects still appear current and up to date, and the acting is superb. This is not a story of good vs evil, but instead a story of survival against an unknown creature, with the crew using limited resources and no available help. The sense of desolation, fear, and struggle for survival will still strike the viewer.<br/><br/>Much of the success of this film is attributable to Ridley Scott and the special effects and creature developers for this movie, but some is due to the lack of CGI available at the time. The creature (in all its forms) looks real because it is real - it was made of real materials, puppets, and a person inside a suit (doesn't sound glamorous, but has to be seen to be believed); the crew is believable because they are not superheroes, but instead hardworking crew members trying to make a living (initially), and eventually trying to just survive at any cost - acting is excellent and believable; the technology is done just right, and is a secondary player not emphasized in the film, so it does not appear dated; the ships are incredibly well-done, and utilize shapes and equipment which appear realistic, and also appear used and lived-in, with dents and dirt that make them believable; the story is a true classic with several twists and turns, however it stays focused without getting lost in distractions and secondary stories.<br/><br/>At the time, many of the ideas and themes of this film were truly original, and have since been borrowed upon. Part of the reason this movie is so successful is that it builds suspense with a clever story which was slowly unrolled, allowing the viewer to digest it and suspense to build. Further, you can follow the story and action because the scenes were created in real time with real people and real props. The difficulty I have with the new generation of CGI films is that there appears to be a push to do and show things ""just to show what they are capable of."" The CGI then becomes the focus of the film, instead of the acting and story. Further, with each new movie trying to out-due the other, CGI is crammed into all scenes at an indigestible density. For me, there is so much detail and motion going on in a dense CGI scene (much more than would be affordable and possible with real props), that the purpose of the scene and the activity get difficult to follow, and become diluted. Once the newer generations of CGI techs and producers become less compelled to flood Sci-Fi scenes with ""everything they've got,"" I hope they can mix a good story and good acting with subtle and believable CGI to create truly great films reminiscent of this masterpiece.<br/><br/>For those that have never seen the original ""Alien,"" please drop everything and see it now - it is that good and you will be surprised. Don't worry about it's age - it doesn't matter; and don't let the sequels throw you off - this one is a true masterpiece! (Although, the second film -Aliens - was also excellent and worth watching.) For those that haven't seen Alien in a while, it's worth watching again. In fact, introduce a friend to a true great film so they know to expect in Sci-Fi films."

","You have chosen wisely, because you are about to see Alien.
Merely 6 actors star in it, in total. There are no supporting actors, besides one cat called Jonesey. It costed only 11 million dollars to make, but it became the most intense and suspenseful worldwide thriller of 1979 and has since then been claimed to be one of the ultimate scifi pictures ever made.<br/><br/>The story: a spaceship crew lands on a mysterious planet, where they get into contact with an alien life form. What follows is the most frightening, exhilarating downfall of an entire spaceship crew ever recorded in scifi history.<br/><br/>I cant think of many other movies in which the fear for what one cant see is so suspenseful as it is in Alien. And Ridley Scott perfected this slowburning, yet riveting suspense style to the ultimate T. Director Ridley Scott has chosen to hide the monster from view most of the time. Not seeing the monster (most of the time) is definitely scarier than seeing it, although the special effects department created one truly horrifying monster as well. Brilliant, truly brilliant suspense!<br/><br/>Alien still stands strong after 40 years. Acting, story, soundtrack, special effects and photography are still all truly magnificent!

"johnnyboyz","7","1","2","6 April 2019"," Superior horror film which executes the basics more than just efficiently.
","They must have thought that that was very clever of them when they first conceived it: depict a female character undress to her briefs, whilst alone in an enclosed space capsule. Then, have her walk around for a bit, distract the audience by leaning over slightly, and then 'wham!' - have the monster of the piece wriggle around a bit in the background within the confines of a crawlspace it has found for itself... Much water has passed beneath the proverbial bridge by this point in the film, however, but it does demonstrate quite perfectly how rudimentary 'jump' scenes such as the one just described can be as effective as this one is if everything around it is executed properly.<br/><br/>The cynic inside of me thinks that, at a time when George Lucas and co. were blasting away at the cinema screen via the ""Star Wars"" films - essentially using outer space as a playground for all manner of shoot-outs and interplanetary crafts hurtling around the place at top speed - Ridley Scott and his team were doing something calmer and more effective much more quietly. In ""Alien"", space is a bleak, lonely place - its ships, like the transport vessels on the open oceans of Earth hundreds of years ago, hulk peacefully through tremendous fields of nothingness, its crew eager to get home, its journey devoid of notoriety, its androids not quirky and funny but potentially deadly.<br/><br/>The film begins with some seemingly unnecessary tracking shots through the corridors of the ship itself, the Nostromo - it appears empty, and surprisingly narrow for its size. The film appears to be introducing to the audience the venue for the fight which is set to follow. On the bridge, some mechanical whirring brings a computer to life and a screen seems to then uncannily 'interact' with a stationary helmet positioned on top of a seat. We then play witness to the crew of seven waking up from some kind of enhanced sleep for long journeys. What becomes evident here and in the following scenes is that there is no clear lead - a captain, played by Tom Skerritt, might fit the bill; so too might an engineer named Parker (Yaphet Kotto), whose qualm with some kind of futuristic payment scheme the film seems to think is important and is something we expect to be resolved later on.<br/><br/>Otherwise, things are fairly anonymous - ""Alien"" keeping its cards close to its chest. When the crew try to figure out why they've been awoken prematurely, given there is no sign of Earth, the film positions the character of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) nearer the back of the bridge and away from the consoles the navigators check for answers. What the crew come up with is a repetitive signal radiating out from a nearby moon every twelve seconds, and conspire to investigate it as per space protocol. In this space-set universe, and unlike Lucas', mankind has seemingly succeeded in avoiding contact with lots of different galactic creatures - convergence with a foreign body not of Earth's proportion is a rare thing.<br/><br/>Still with no clear lead, a gang of volunteers venture out into a storm after the ship has landed on the moon - the inhospitable weather, violent winds and unwelcoming atmosphere conspiring to act as a kind of warning or prelude for the situation to come. Having bravely nominated himself to be amongst the first to investigate, and then to go below-deck once they discover a shipwreck, John Hurt's character Kane presents himself to the audience as a protagonist of sorts: the explorer, the discoverer - what he discovers are thousands of small eggs and then something else besides when he gets a little too close.<br/><br/>Back on board the Nostromo, the events which play out for the rest of the film have etched themselves into a kind of cinematic legend - is there a person alive who does not know how the biology of the face-hugger works? Or what to expect when you're not expecting? Apparently paralysed by his venture, our volunteer hero Kane is seemingly out of the equation as two others in the form of the aforementioned Captain Dallas and a science officer named Ash (Ian Holm) step up to take his place. But why does the film think it important for Dallas to digress said officer was only instated on the mission mere days before disembarkation? Saints be praised, Kane appears to wake up and we have our lead back...<br/><br/>The genius behind ""Alien"" within the confines of its genre and what it's attempting to do lies in what director Ridley Scott does with what he has at his disposal. Much later on, when we sense the creature is in a large storage hold with one of the crewmembers, Scott uses the water dripping down from a vent shaft high in the ceiling to create a leathery sound as it rebounds off a crewman's cap, and we're never quite sure if we're hearing that or the monster's own limbs wriggling into an attack position.<br/><br/>As a setting, the old beaten up Nostromo itself makes for the perfect locality - there is certainly something in the way it hulks towards us in the film's opening few shots, heavy in the load it's carrying, and we sense it has seen better days. Its interior lighting is a little funky, illuminating some parts of some corridors and not others, as would reflect its deterioration over time. It feels like an unreliable host, even more so when it is damaged upon landing on the mysterious moon, and this paranoia of the on-board technology betraying us later occurs.<br/><br/>Simplicity is the key to ""Alien"" - its three-act structure, the first of which culminates with the egg discovery; the second of which concludes with the alien's birth and the third of which concludes with the biggest bang of them all, before a brief postface, is executed brilliantly. Reputation and place in popular culture aside, see ""Alien"" if you have not already done so."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","10","1","2","8 March 2019"," The epitome of the sci-fi/horror sub-genre.
","Science fiction in film has faced an uphill battle in terms of being taken seriously. Up until the late 1960's, most sci-fi was low-budget, B-movie schlock more likely to be Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fodder than Oscar potential. This all changed in 1968 with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Now that sci-fi could be considered art it took almost a decade for other films to capitalize on Kubrick's groundbreaking work. Star Wars (1977) expanded on the special effects and made sci-fi a fun, action-filled ride. Regarding the horror aspect of sci-fi, Alien (1979) remains the founding film of these combined genres.<br/><br/>Not only does Ridley Scott do a fantastic job directing this movie, in particular through the use of elaborate sets, puppetry, and just plain spectacular cinematography; but the fact that Alien has an incredibly strong female protagonist (Sigourney Weaver's Ripley) puts it leagues ahead of its time in terms of character-driven plot. The fact that she was brought back for the James Cameron sequel, Aliens (1986), is merely a testament to how strong her character's impact on the original film was. Of course, part of the reason Ripley stood out as a unique personality was due to the antagonist: the eponymous Alien.<br/><br/>The horror of the unseen remains the best technique to build suspense, but the gruesome visage of this creature delivers all the horror the plot had built up. Unlike some of the B-movie horror of earlier decades, this monster is realistic enough to give a legitimate scare without giving away the puppetry technique behind it via poorly designed costumes or visible support wires. The fact that this alien is nigh indestructible (and has acid for blood in case it does get injured) merely adds to the terror of it running rampant on a cramped spaceship.<br/><br/>The epitome of the sci-fi/horror sub-genre, I give Alien 5.0 stars out of 5."
"victorsilva-23877","10","1","2","7 March 2019"," Ridley Scott's masterpiece
","This may be one of the greatest films of all time. Alien has remained one of the greatest sci-fi's of all time ever since being released in 1979.<br/><br/>As the film opens, Jerry Goldsmiths score immediately enthralls you with a sense of uneasiness, something just doesn't feel right. Through the first few minutes, empty shots of the corridors and consoles build up the feeling of dread before a word of dialogue is even spoken.<br/><br/>The Nostromo may be one of the best practical environments ever put too film. It feels dirty and lived in and it's just not a pleasant place. As the film goes on, the environment increasingly adds to the tension to really immerse you in the experience.<br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal, the 7 man crew of the Nostromo has remained classic even 40 years after the original release. With this film, Ellen Ripley became one of the big sci-fi heroes whose name will never be forgotten.<br/><br/>The Alien itself may be the best monster ever put on screen. It has very little screen time, but you feel it's presence ever since it is born through one of the most iconic scenes ever. The design is beautiful, yet extremely disturbing at the same time through it's birthing process to how it's always effectively cloaked in shadow.<br/><br/>Lastly, Ridley Scotts direction is masterful. The suspense is continuous and you always feel like the Alien could be just around the corner. He builds tension so effectively with barely any jumps unlike what you see in modern horror.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is one of the greatest films ever made in every aspect.

You won't have that problem here, our human and likeble cast are people you care for.

"harriseric-32698","Null","1","2","25 February 2019"," As perfect as any film can be
","Ridley Scott's Alien was not just a seminal science fiction horror film which redefined the genre, it was also a landmark film for female leads in horror/sci-fi and one of the finest examples of combining two genres (in this case science fiction and horror) to create a masterpiece. Written by Dan O Bannon, expertly directed by Scott (in what was then his 2nd film only) and utilizing the works of great artisan craftsman like H.R Giger and Ron Cobb Alien is a masterpiece of most facets of filmmaking. The actors are all incredibly good in their respective roles of space grunts, but 29-year-old Sigourney Weaver shines the most. Alien is 40 years old (!!!) and yet it is as timeless as if it were made last year. The sets and creature design look fantastic as does the pacing which only reinforces the belief that a good film doesn't have to be swiftly paced."
"RatedVforVinny","10","1","2","22 February 2019"," The ultimate in Sci-Fi horror!
","Along with 'The Thing', 'Alien', was by far the best 'Creature Feature' of all time. Now just 40 years after the original vision, it's hard to write a review or even start to reflect the magnitude of this gigantic, monster of a movie. Perfect set/alien designs by H.R Giger, top-notch acting from an all stellar cast, a fine musical score by Jerry Goldsmith and last but not least, the very film that put Ridley Scott, on the cinematic map. Of an interesting note the great Walter Hill, with no previous experience of the Sci-Fi genre, ended up as the producer (and also writing one of the first drafts). Originally they had scripted the alien to impregnate a female member of the crew but they thought that this most shocking of concepts, was taking it (what is almost a B-movie plot) a bit too far. Still though a stand alone classic, that in space and time will never be forgotten."

","I watched Alien for the first time recently, and I was really excited! I've heard countless times that it's a ""must-see"" and a ""classic"", and while I agree with that to an extent, I was kind of disappointed.<br/><br/>A lot of Alien is watching the ship flying slowly across the screen while members of the crew press buttons. It's a really slow movie, and while this does help build suspense, it also makes it a bit of a chore to sit through.<br/><br/>There are enjoyable moments though; the chestburster scene is especially great, and so are most scenes with the alien.<br/><br/>When this movie came out in 1979, it included some of the most brutal things you could watch in a film. However, I don't think it holds up particularly well today. I wasn't scared at all, which is supposed to be the aim of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Alien isn't for me. I admit that it's a classic, and it changed cinema, so for that I respect it, but I can't see myself rewatching it any time soon."

","In space, nobody can hear you scream. While on route home, the crew of the Nostromo commercial spaceship pick up an apparent distress signal from a nearby moon, which they are duty bound to investigate.

They try to make a hasty getaway but things are already too late as they've let something alien onto their spaceship.<br/><br/>This visionary Ridley Scott film is an absolute classic which crosses genres so easily - It's part Sci-Fi, part Horror, part Thriller, with a lot of action and drama to boot. It's delivered with style and substance making it not just look amazing, but the technology and science behind it too stands strong. A testament to the quality of both the story and delivery on screen is that it has stood strong for from the 1970's and is still recognised some 40/50 years later as an absolute masterpiece of cinema. It's spawned sequels, prequels, comics, games, comics, and fan memorabilia/merchandise.<br/><br/>Starring Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto, Helen Horton - and let's not forget Sigourney Weaver - of who it made an absolute icon of film the acting in this is top class. On the subject of Weaver's performance, not only did she deliver a brilliant performance she also goes against cinema convention as the tough, no-nonsense hero of the film where most conventional films would have had a male lead instead. The way they come across, there is no outright leader, there is no star, and there isn't a go-to person - they are all fragile, average joe's who are living on the edge and could be killed off without easily. They are ordinary people who are doing the best they can and surviving while living in fear. Kudos to Scott for actively encouraging the cast to ad-lib certain moments, it gave real authenticity to the performances. In addition, the way he interacted with them really provided an additional layer of emotion - off-screen they were reported to have been encouraged to annoy each other, so that when the cameras were rolling the audience would pick up on the tension. The cast help to give an un-easy feel to the film which is littered with haunting and daunting scenery - making the prospect of the future something more industrial and hardworking. There are times where it feels like the crew is working in some dirty and sweaty industrial factory or prison rather than what the media has perceived as the clean and cool future of space travel in the future. Using the confines of the spaceship as a playground there is no escape from the alien which is hunting them down one by one. The alien is brilliant; it's a fine mix of puppetry, live action and model - which is has haunted film goers now for decades. Hat's off to H.R.Giger for the artistic concepts, it was this film that got me interested in his art work and I've never regretted it. Designing the alien as a non-human humanoid makes the creature but familiar and unfamiliar at the same time - a real creature of nightmares. The elongated head, the jaw, the violent stabbing tongue, no eyes - it's something that humans could have evolved into rather than what we are now, in an alternative reality. One of the things that make it so menacing is its soulless, chaotic and violent approach to hunting. There is no sense to its targeting; it kills because that's what it does. If it doesn't kill you outright it impregnates its host, and then you are on a count-down until you get torn apart from the inside while an alien spawn uses your body like a battery. The Alien, while being the titular vehicle to the film, isn't the sole source of horror and tension in the film - it doesn't appear until after an hour and then only has about 5mins screen time - no, as mentioned, the environment and people stuck in the environment create their own tension as survival feels almost inconceivable, but the score sets the tension up wonderfully too. So much work and effort has gone into every aspect of the film that it's a masterclass; from the directing, to the writing (Dan O'Bannon & Ronald Shusett), to the acting, to the art and design (by Moebius, Chris Foss and Swiss surrealist artist H.R.Giger) - all on point.<br/><br/>If it isn't obvious from the passionate write up I have given this, I love this film. It may not have been successfully received in the 70's (some saying it was ""Jaws"" or ""Friday the 13th"" in space) - but by the time I watched this in my childhood it was something that stayed with me. I'd recommend everybody to watch this film at least once as this really is a pivot movie in the history of film and the evolution of genre defying art mediums. 10 out of 10."

","Horror in Space, that's what this is. It's a space monster movie, and the thing is, if you see Aliens, or most of the other Alien related films BEFORE you see this one, you're going to be expecting something completely different.<br/><br/>But what you have is a horror movie set on a space ship with an atmosphere so thick that you could cut it with a knife.<br/><br/>You can taste the eerie tension when you watch it...and, at least in my eyes, that makes it better than the over-the-top Space Marines that you see in the later installments.<br/><br/>And, no questions are answered. There is no broad sweeping mythology. There is only the movie, there is only the monster, there is only the fear and tension. But that is all the movie needs.<br/><br/>It's just science-fiction and scary. It's a brilliant merger.<br/><br/>But, don't listen to the people making it out to be more than it is.

"jacobreyes-78678","10","1","2","27 November 2018"," Alien (1979): An Interesting Look At What Sci-Fi Movies Can Be
","I am a big fan of movies and science fiction movies in particular. Films like Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey, are a few of my favorites which I have viewed dozens of times. Very recently while I was browsing for a good movie to watch one night, I came across Alien directed by Ridley Scott. I had already watched this movie when I was much younger and I remembered enjoying it a lot so I decided to give it another watch. After this second viewing I completely fell in love with this movie, and if you give it a try (you totally should) you probably will too.<br/><br/>To start off, in order to understand part of what makes this movie so incredible is its originality in a time in which every new sci-fi movie attempted to copy Star Wars in order to be successful. However with Ridley Scott's masterpiece Alien this is not the case. This film follows the crew of the USCSS Nostramo after they awake from hyperspace after receiving a mysterious transmission from a nearby planet infested with deadly Aliens called Xenomorphs. When the crew goes to investigate the signal, one of these deadly aliens manages to get onto their ship and begins to hunt the crew one by one.
Perhaps the biggest factor that immediately sets Alien apart from Star Wars and most other movies set in Outer Space at the time, is the films reserved usage of action sequences. On the contrary this film takes a more slow and steady approach, in which the crew and the Xenomorph play a drawn out game of chess where each side tries to outsmart the other in order to survive. The conflict between man and monster in this clever film is not fought with laser guns, but rather with wit and strategy.<br/><br/>In fact this interesting concept would be impossible to properly execute without the creepy visuals and score. A huge part of this effect is the set design of the USCSS Nostramo, the ship where the majority of this movie takes place. This ship feels very lived in and claustrophobic and Ridley Scott did an incredible job of creating a world that feels entirely real in his movie. Another important piece of this world is the crew itself. All the members of this crew interact and have conversations that feel completely natural and realistic which hugely adds to the reality of this fictional world. The sound design and score of this movie are also great because they cause the audience to feel a sense of constant dread and paranoia from beginning to end. The music and eerie sound effects never give the audience time to breathe in between attacks from the monster. Even when it isn't in view the audience is still left in suspense as the Xenomorph can jump out from anywhere on screen and pick off its newest victim.
Speaking of the monster, it is specifically designed to evoke true horror from anyone watching. From its sleek black body, to its long creepy tail, to the fact that when eating its prey the xenomorph opens its mouth and a smaller mouth comes out to get the final bite, everything about these creatures is scary. Even the way they are born is very disturbing as a creature known as a face-hugger, (another very horrifying creature) lays its eggs within its victim's throat for its baby to burst through the victim's chest when it has hatched.
On the other less creepy hand, the main protagonist and sole survivor of the movie, Ellen Ripley is equally important to this movie as she is continuously displayed to be the only member of the crew with the set of skills necessary to survive in a situation of fear. What makes Ripley such a fascinating character and one of my personal favorite movie heroes is that she is always able to maintain a clear head and think rationally. Whether it be deciding to self-destruct the ship and taking an escape shuttle in the hopes of killing the Xenomorph, or launching the beast into outer space just before it can kill her, Ripley always has a back-up plan which is why she is able to survive to the very end of the movie. Another interesting character in Alien is that of Ash, who was revealed to be an android the whole time with seperate orders from the central computer of the ship to get the Xenomorph back to Earth so that it could be experimented on and potentially made profitable. What makes Ash even more of an interesting character is that upon repeated viewings there are many subtle clues at the beginning of the film hinting about Ash's secret.<br/><br/>Altogether Alien is an absolute masterclass of the science fiction genre with iconic scenes, characters, and visuals that managed to stand the test of time. With little nuances and mysterious unanswered questions on top of a film built on very strong foundations, Alien was a movie that was relevant in a time of Star Wars dominance and is still relevant nearly 40 years later due to its masterful film making. If you are someone who enjoys movies about space, aliens, interesting characters, or just a fan of movies in general, I highly recommend Ridley Scott's masterpiece Alien."
"fredroyer","8","1","2","10 September 2018"," Fill in the blanks
","Ridley Scott's 'Alien' is still his most impressive movie, it was only his second film, that every effect is physical (the opening credits is a camera panning over a painting!), and that the budget was so low the ""spacecraft"" is an odd mish mash of various components that Spaceballs would spoof with their giant ""Spaceball One"" ship. <br/><br/>More than any other directors I know except maybe Zack Snyder, Ridley Scott has the ability to create a unique look and has the mastery of craft to coordinate every element (acting, score, movement) to reinforce that look. <br/><br/>That he chose Giger to base the look on was brilliant. Evil without the constraints of morality conveyed by an organic lifeform constantly dripping goo. <br/><br/>The alien ship, though only briefly shown, is a sequence that will live way past the time that the monsters of the series are forgotten; that blending of beast, environment and narrative is unique in all filmdom. Really amazing that the sequels didn't go back to that ship until Prometheus, and it looked like half the audience complained about that anyway. Ridley was forced to add the classic Xenomorph in a tacked on ending sequence because the test audience demanded ""The Beast"".<br/><br/>The movie seems to have a lot in common with ""Planet of the Vampires"" although the writers deny it.<br/><br/>The real reason I like this movie so much was because you had to fill in the gaps with your own imagination. What I filled in was that the juggernaut was an entirely bio-mechanical creation, intentionally crashed on that alien planet. The company then sent the miners, unaware, to retrieve the specimen and bring it back to earth without anyone knowing the better.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't work without Ian Holmes. Ridley needed an actor of his caliber to play that character because the audience has to find out the same time the other characters do about his truth."
"adam-may-bower","10","1","2","2 June 2018"," A Masterpiece
","'Alien' is a slow-burning and masterful science-fiction horror that well deserves its critical acclaim. Having never been a huge fan of the science-fiction genre, I never felt that compelled to watch it, but given the fact that this is often referred to as ""one of the best horror films ever made"" I decided to give it a shot - and it absolutely exceeded my expectations and I can confidently say that this is one of the best horrors I have ever seen. Every single aspect of this film is flawless, from its elaborate set design to its captivating cinematography. Scott's direction is polished and skillful, building up great amounts of tension (with the help of a fantastic score by Jerry Goldsmith) and resulting in a fantastic and terrifying climax. But what really shines in this film is the acting, with a profound and real performance from Sigourney Weaver. Weaver brings the character of Ripley to life and makes her feel like a real character. By displaying the right amount of terror and the perfect amount of badass, Weaver's character becomes an instant favorite among any horror movie franchise. The plot of Alien is nice and straightforward, as most horror films should be, leaving the focus to be on the survival of the characters. What makes Alien stand out from the rest, is its underlying metaphors that give the film depth and complexity. Overall, this was a brilliant film that can effortlessly be penned as one of the best horror films made."
"benkitching13","8","1","2","24 December 2017"," Incosistently flawless.
","The opening third of Alien provides for an immersive, captivatingly well shot and utterly tense sequence of scenes that sets a virtually impeccable standard of quality for the rest of the picture to match. <br/><br/>Therefore it is regretful that, to some extent, the remainder of the picture dissolves into an elongated cat and mouse chase that (despite the best efforts of the writers) occasionally feels dull and excessively long and somewhat dilutes the aforementioned immersion and tension. <br/><br/>That isn't to deny that a considerable length of the remainder is composed of commendably tense and terrifying moments. <br/><br/>Alien hosts a varied assortment of impressive performances, and consistently delivers some of the most intelligently crafted cinematography I can ever recall viewing. <br/><br/>Ultimately , I believe that Blade Runner is the more consistent and overall more immersive picture that succeeds in delivering a more alluring conclusion. <br/><br/>Alien may be inconsistent experience, though in it's highest quality scenes it's spectacular and reaches near masterpiece status, warranting viewing."

"tomgillespie2002","10","1","2","27 August 2017"," Scott reminds us of a time when he was capable of delivering pure cinematic magic
","Before the stream of sequels, spin-offs, video games, board games, and it's own incredibly underwhelming origin story, and before this year's shameless yet occasionally entertaining rip-off Life, there was Ridley Scott's Alien, a masterclass in how to create an A- picture out of a B-list idea and budget. Even before that of course, there was Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires, but Scott infuses his film with such elegance, sheer horror, and it's very own mythos (which would be tirelessly explored in the aforementioned extended multi-media universe), that to label the seminal sci-fi classic as plagiarism of Bava's interesting, if schlocky, 60's space opera would be preposterous (although it clearly draws inspiration). As a favourite of most children growing up in the 80's and 90's, Alien joins the likes of Jaws, Back to the Future, The Goonies and Close Encounters of the Third Kind as one of the untouchable genre classics.<br/><br/>The crew of the Nostronomo, a starship freighter owned by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation are awoken from hypersleep by an urgent message from the on-board computer, Mother. A signal has been detected coming from a nearby planetoid, and by the terms of their contract they are obligated to investigate. The crew are a rag-tag bunch of what can only be described as working-class space truckers; scruffy, chain-smoking, and constantly complaining about pay. Many of them, including Warrant Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), object to the unnecessary risk, but Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt) overrules. Touching down on the dark, desolate planet, they quickly come across a crashed alien ship containing the dead body of a large, unknown species. Executive Officer Kane (John Hurt) probes further, eventually discovering what appears to be a nesting area. One of the eggs opens, and a spider-like creature attaches itself to his face, rendering him unresponsive but alive.<br/><br/>It's isn't difficult to work out how things unravel from this point. After the shock of the 'chestburster' scene (which I still recall seeing for the first time as a youngster), Alien follows the tradition of the slasher flick. But one of the many things that separates the film from the formulaic tedium of the slasher genre is the care Scott takes with showing you very little. The brief glimpses of the xenomorph, growing rapidly as the film progresses, are terrifying enough, but it's the long moments between the kills that makes Alien so engrossing. The design of the ship's interior is dark and dank, almost reptilian in appearance, purposely sculpted to make it seem that the creature could pop out of any corner of the screen, at any time. Our fears are confirmed in one particularly effective sequence involving the search for the ship's cat Jones, where what appears to be some harmless tubing in the background suddenly turns into an oozing, snarling face..<br/><br/>Now one of the most iconic monsters in cinema history, the xenomorph is a clever accumulation of our worst fears. A creature of pure survival, it serves only to prolong the existence of its species, whether it be to wipe out any possible threat, or using its victims as hosts for its offspring. James Cameron's admittedly excellent sequel threw more of them at the screen, and the subsequent films opted for CGI. But there is nothing scary about special effects, and Bolaji Badejo's performance inside the suit proves that practical effects can stand the test of time, and completely terrify when employed correctly. The alien isn't the only star of the show however, as Sigourney Weaver's badass survivor Ripley is one of the silver screen's most recognisable and much-loved heroines, in a role that could have been a simple 'last girl' routine in the hands of a lesser actor. She is backed up by a fantastic cast that also includes Veronica Cartwright, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Kotto, all making their archetype characters feel alive. But the real star is Scott who, having gone off the boil in recent years, reminds us of a time when he was capable of delivering pure cinematic magic."

Though I do enjoy a good horror, which 'Alien' most certainly is.<br/><br/>Considering 'Alien' was released in 1979, it feels remarkably fresh. It's a film that has aged extremely well - even today the horror elements are just as effective and don't feel dated like in many other older horrors.

Modern special effects lacks the restraint and respect needed to induce a genuine psychological response. Must be seen."
"spencergrande6","10","1","2","27 July 2017"," I don't know what makes this film work
","What can I possibly contribute to the dialectic at this point? I guess just some stuff for my own amusement. I don't know what makes this film work.<br/><br/>It is of course, exquisitely made - the rhythms and pacing are second to none - you hear endlessly about withholding the big reveal (ala Jaws) but here it works even better that most do because the reveals kind of keep on happening. It starts small with an egg, then its a facehugger, acid blood, chestburster, little alien, and finally the full-on Alien, and even then it's mostly face and head (and mini-head) until the end. There's always something to occupy the fear and it keeps getting upped.<br/><br/>The whole end of this film is unrelenting tension. It's almost seizure inducing watching Ripley run around the ship with the blinking lights and the countdown chiming and the Alien around every corner - hypnotizing and petrifying. The first kill scene with the Alien descending the chains is a perfect blend of sight and sound. Same goes for most of the Alien's kill scenes (only ones that bother me are the tunnels, it's a great scene undone by stupidity - why do they think it's in the same tunnel as him and even if it is just blast the fire! don't run). The wide shot of the Alien turning towards Lambert is the only one that shows its age. Very tank like, no arm movement. Thankfully it's short lived. From what I read Scott didn't like those wides either.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is iconic of course, and it helps that she's a woman defeating this rapist (the two women are the last two standing) but it's clear the film isn't making it an agenda. It's just a part of the natural structure of the story. It's nonchalant. And personally, as great as she is in this, she's a pure action and reaction cipher (not that there's anything wrong with that- a whole character is suggested by her behaviors, mannerisms and interactions). But Ripley's stature is truly carved in stone in Aliens.<br/><br/>The set designs and creature designs are incredibly believable and awe-inducing. Ridley liked the space jockey so much he has created a whole new set of films about it - that's one memorable shot. They were, of course, a large jump forward for the time but that wouldn't hold up in posterity if it didn't still work and it does, because the design is still unmatched in terms of bold imagination. Surreal, slimy, sexual, black, chrome, nightmarish, otherworldly yet human - it's really the ultimate creature design for a reason. It's not just cool and terrifying, it suggests themes, nightmares we haven't had yet, the past the future, it even blends in with the blue collar working class rusted out futuristic space shuttle it stalks in.<br/><br/>What makes a withholding film work is that the payoff is worth it. Audiences can't suffer a bad good movie - one that knows what it takes to make something work but doesn't execute - but they're fine with a bad bad movie because at least it's mindless and ""delivers"". So when a slow burn actually works, it changes the whole entire landscape. When it doesn't, it bombs hard (especially with audiences). Everything else is in-between. This is one of the good good ones, duh."
"yourfavoritecritic","8","1","2","24 July 2017"," The Final Frontier
","Released in 1979 Alien marked one of the first blockbuster films for director Ridley Scott and the debut of actress, Sigourney Weaver. Alien tells the story of a crew travelling through space receiving a distress call from an unknown transmission and after deciding to land their craft near the source of the signal, they find themselves being hunted by a mysterious life-form who's lifecycle has just begun. There is not much to say about this movie which hasn't been said before, it is damn good. Alien very much reminds me of a cross between Star Trek and 2001: A Space Odyssey, both properties which have practically paved the way for science fiction entertainment. The world building in this film was nuts, I love the set up of the ship and inklings we get about what earth looks like at the time this movie takes place in. Alien's premise is very much set up to play on the fear of viewers and coming from a huge horror movie buff, I wasn't all that frightened by the sequences of horror which took place. Not to say those scenes in particular weren't scary, I just didn't personally like them all too much however I can see why people claim this film to be one of the scariest movies ever. Even though the horror element may not work, Ridley Scott really knows how to build up a scene, the intensity brought forth in some scenes is quite good. The creature in this film is a force of nature and though the design of it is cool, I was never frightened by it. The scariest parts of this film is not knowing exactly where it is and it is here where Scott really amps up the intensity, making the scenes which do not feature the alien more effective in its scariness. Now even though Ridley Scott does an excellent job directing this film, the actors and actresses in this film are equally as good. Sigourney Weaver, who was unknown at the time of filming, gave a damn good performance. It was awesome seeing such a strong female lead be able to take on and accomplish tasks that would otherwise require the assistance of another character. Having such a independent women for a character was quite uncommon for movies to do at the time, so all the props go to filmmakers involved for being so progressive. Now what really elevates this movie from being just good, to great, is its last fifteen minutes. There came a point in the movie where I thought the movie was wrapping up, the story over but then out of nowhere the movie hits you with another climax which is just so excellently done, I would re-watch the film solely for that third act. Overall I quite enjoyed Alien, and even though this was my first time seeing it, I do see the film growing on me. If you have not seen Alien, I would highly recommend you do so, it is a perfect example of great filmmaking back almost forty years ago that still holds up to this day, Alien gets a 8/10."

The second act and third act are perfectly executed and we are hooked to experience the terror and suspicion with the main character. Hell even the robot revelation at the end of the second act does not seem far-fetched at all, and it incredibly increases the tension at that point. The only problem I have with the film is the cat. It clearly serves as a plot devise, but not a very good one. I cannot see how it is a strong motivation for the risks the crew undertake in rescuing it.

","After seeing the Alien Covenant and becoming quite disappointed, Alien was set up at the Filmens House in Oslo.(an independent film house) The timing could not be better than a reminder of the Alien masterpiece. I had to go. The movie that started this series of films.Iam glad to find out that the film has not really lost anything, considering it came out in 1979. Why is it so good? In my opinion, it has everything that a top horror movie should have. 1. The actors are brilliantly cast and portray different reactions and behaviors when people are put under pressure and exposed to the worst imaginable strains. Anxiety, unrest, anger - played out. Friendship and cooperation are put to the test. 2. The story is carefully built up. Here are no big action scenes, or spectacular stunts. Only the story-line that is so well portrayed and the anxiety we, the audience feel too, when we watch the movie. 3) The film is undoubtedly groundbreaking, with her female heroine taking on the role of leader under strong pressure. I once read that Alfred Hitcock had said that: The audience likes to be scared. It fits very well and is probably the explanation that this movie has become a classic. For all young people who have not seen it, see it!!. And ask their local movie club to set it up at the cinema, so you'll see how a movie masterpiece is and experience watching a top horror movie, which you'll won't soon forget."

","Alien is usually called a tough survival flick. It is not really an action film. The two classes of employees in the ship Nostromo is established earlier on when technicians Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Kotto humorously complain about the discrepancy in salaries between them and the rest of the crew. But this is never really developed upon.<br/><br/>Ripley's cold hard bitch nature is underscored when she refuses to let in the search team that has comeback with an alien being on the face of one of the explorers. I felt a distance from the characters. They all came across as cold and sterile. It was a really disturbing film. The claustrophobic environment filled with electronic hatches deserves special mention. Jerry Goldsmith's terrific background score that sounds like an army of rats swarming over earth was very apt for this film.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is used as a sex object towards the end of the film when she takes off her clothes while escaping in one of the smaller space vehicles. I am not complaining. Sigourney looked gorgeous. I felt bad for her when Veronica Cartwright slapped her. I felt like Sandra Bullock might have tried to replicate this in GRAVITY. Ian Holm has the best bit of dialog in the film. The scene where the alien takes away Harry Dean Stanton and cuts to the cat watching meekly was very clever."

","A fantastic time-capsule from the late '70s, the era of patient filmmaking, practical effects and potent new ideas. In borrowing from and expanding upon themes first incubated in Kubrick's 2001, director Ridley Scott delivers a tangible, chilling take on humanity's star-faring future. The basic concept is devilishly simple: a hapless freighter crew lands on an uncharted planet, picks up a murderous uninvited guest, then spends the rest of the picture trying (and failing) to outlast it in a claustrophobic environment. But there's so very much more to it than that. Expert character development rewards us with an intensely human, accessible crew. It really hurts each time one of them succumbs to a howling, terrified death. The film represents a master class in tension-building, investing long spans of film in thick, dramatic pauses that pay dividends. It works as a social allegory, too: even generations from now, with our destiny amidst the stars, the working class draws the short straw and risks everything for a meager paycheck. And, perhaps most impressive of all, it's a jaw-dropping visual powerhouse. The style in this film is unmatched, from the fuzzy monitors and tangled wires aboard the flight deck to H.R. Geiger's legendary grotesque monster and environment designs. We enjoy a constant sense of wonder, awed by what we're seeing but grounded by the perceived physical reality of it all. All this, and I haven't even mentioned the acting, direction or effects work. A sci-fi legend through and through, this is one of the best-realized (and finest-aging) genre torchbearers ever."
"guedesnino","9","1","2","11 June 2017"," A root Sci-Fi.
","In a direct and simplistic summary, ""Alien"" is a movie about things that can jump out of the dark and kill you. Share a kinship with movies like: shark, Halloween and others that involve varied spiders, snakes, tarantulas and persecutors. But the looks end many before that.<br/><br/>One of the great strengths of ""Alien"" and consequently of director Ridley Scott, is his pace. ""Alien"" takes your time. He waits. It allows silences (the majestic opening shots are underlined by Jerry Goldsmith with only distant metallic vibrations). This suggests the enormity of the team's discovery, building itself up with small steps: the interception of a signal (is it a warning or an SOS?). The descent to the extraterrestrial surface. The bitching by Brett and Parker, who care only about collecting their shares. The master stroke of the dark surface through which the crew members move, their helmet lights hardly penetrate the soup. The shadowy outline of the alien ship. The sight of the alien pilot, frozen in his command chair. The enormity of the discovery inside the ship.<br/><br/>""Alien"" uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the film: it evolves the creature's nature and appearance, so we never know exactly what it looks like and what it can do. We assume that, in the first place, the eggs will produce a humanoid, because that is the shape of the petrified pilot on the alien ship long lost. But of course we do not even know if the pilot is of the same race as the load of leathery eggs. Maybe he also considers them as a weapon. The first time we take a good look at the alien, when it explodes in the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic, and critic Tim Dirks mentions his ""open and dripping vaginal mouth.""<br/><br/>Certainly, the character of Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, would have attracted readers of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. She has little interest in the novel of finding the alien, and even less in her employer's orders that it be brought back home as a potential weapon. After she sees what she can do, her response to ""Special Request 24"" (""Return to alien life form, all other priorities rescinded"") is succinct: ""How can we kill it?"" His relentless hatred for the alien is the common thread running through the three ""Alien"" sequences, which have gradually declined in quality but retain their motivating obsession.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the inheritance that ""Alien"" made possible to the genre Sci-Fi and in addition and much more besides the franchise films that followed after the film of 1979, glimpses the craft relation of producing a film that could go by the yearnings of the Commercial cinema and also by the relation of not giving up the original embryo and not clichÃ© between suspensions, terror and fiction."

","I need to better familiarize myself with Ridley Scott. He's a director I have heard mixed reviews about, and one whom I have only seen a handful of his films. The first Ridley Scott film I watched was Legend, and I only saw that because Tim Curry was in it. Next, I watched The Martian, which is only memorable to me as being the first film I watched on my new blu-ray player, though it was a decent film. Alien fit my June theme of watching titles made up of one word or syllable. I guess what I'm getting at is that I've never been drawn to Ridley Scott's films for what they are, they've just always worked their way into my viewing schedules. After seeing Blade Runner last month, however, I began to become a bit more interested in Ridley Scott the director. His 1979 feature, Alien, starred Sigourney Weaver, and John Hurt as members of a team traveling through space to answer to an S.O.S. call from a distant moon. In what sounds like a paint-by-numbers who-dies-next film, Ridley Scott achieves an exceptionally atmospheric suspense film forcing itself to still be recognized today.<br/><br/>In the near future, the year 2122, a commercial spaceship Nostromo intercepts a distress signal from a nearby moon. The seven-member crew, who had been in hypersleep are awoken as they begin their descent to the distressed moon. Kane (John Hurt) is the member lucky enough to be the one exploring the moon attempting to find the source of the stress. He gets too close to the discovery of eggs as one attaches to him putting him into a coma. Ash (Ian Holm) pushes for him to be allowed back on board the ship breaking protocol which puts all members of the team at risk. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) fights against breaking protocol the most making her an outcast on the team. The team watches Kane when suddenly the parasite dies and he awakens, seemingly largely unfazed by the incident. At dinner, however, it is revealed that much more danger is in store for the team than initially anticipated. <br/><br/>I am such a sucker for sound design. I can become emotionally invested in a film for no other reason than its sound. I wrote down in three different ways in my notes how incredible the sound design was in Alien. I love John Hurt (R.I.P.) and Harry Dean Stanton so I was happy to see them in a film together. The vast incredible production design was an absolute treat to watch. The pacing and build-up of action were top- notch and demands the audience's attention all the way through. Typically, I don't pay too much attention to the actors in a film because I am so invested in the technical aspects, but Sigourney Weaver was incredible as the no-nonsense crew member who refused to be beaten. I enjoy the films in which the cast is picked off one-by-one, provided that it's done well and remains suspenseful, and Alien fits that bill. Despite the fact that at a certain point, you knew this was going to be a film where not many were left standing at the end, the tenseness and the deliberate pacing kept the film intriguing enough through the end. As a footnote, I have a huge cinematic black spot when it comes to sci- fi films so the only exposure I had to the famous scene in which an alien comes out of John Hurt's body was a Halloween costume worn by Darlene on Roseanne, so it was nice to finally know where that came from. A thrilling horror-sci-fi film that kept me interested in a genre I usually dismiss means I just may watch the rest of this series and end up seeing the new installment this year."

","The cinematic work that inspired and shaped a genre, when in the late 1970s, visionary Ridley Scott decided to tackle a syfy suspense fiction, it was surprising, not that there has never been anything like it before, but focus on terror is something different , ""Alien"" is a cult and an inspiration for a whole pop culture that would be created later, besides being a great movie. Telling the story of an aircraft in the future manned by 7 astronauts that receives a strange call coming from a small mysterious planet, when descending to investigate they end up bringing inside the ship a curious and lethal form of alien life. We have a premise that would be widely copied over the years, with a focus on suspense, creating an atmosphere of terror but without throwing away syfy elements, ""Alien"" does not have a spectacular script, quite the opposite, the same Has many holes that almost 40 years later have not yet been solved, but even so, his script knows how to balance all elements of the film, besides being linear, thought-provoking and have a great rhythm. When ""Alien"" was released the man had already gone to the moon to ten years, even being a film where the space knowledge was not gigantic, the film commits innumerable gaffes, that for example ""Odyssey in space"" of 68 does not commit, that It bothers a little bit, but when we come across photography and the art direction, we leave it a little aside. Unlike other films of the genre, we have a full- blown photograph of dark tones, which is wonderful for the mood of the film, but it betrays a little the art direction of the film, which even dazzles, if it performs spectacularly well, full of buttons, levers And lights, the film perfectly transmits the atmosphere of the interior of a ship, and in a simple way manages to transmit a threatening planet, save a highlight to the interior of the ship to find in the planet of ""Aliens"", it is simply perfect and at the same time We can not fail to mention the great soundtrack, although little present, when the same discreetly participates in the film, always helps to perfectly compose the climate of the film, the edition of the film leaves to be desired, even if it is 2 hours, it seems Which is missing much in the film. We do not have great acting, so let's emphasize our unlikely heroine, the actress Sigourney Weaver - it's great how the movie builds an entire bow for a hero, and then changes that- But our featured character here is Alien himself, his whole aura Mysterious is great, the fact that little appears and is never very visible is fantastic and plays with the viewer's imagination, as well as being extremely scary, And finally, our medal of honor to Ridley Scott for practically grounding a genre And make a great movie.

Furthermore, the pace and tone of the film build horrific tension perfectly. It may be a gradual tale of rising stakes but it never feels slow or boring. The greatest feat of all is creating a terrifying movie monster but never giving the audience enough of it. The perfect amount of reveals makes it so we keep coming back for more.

"E23George","10","1","2","7 May 2017"," Alien essay - monster magic
","Alien, for me, was always the antithesis of Star Wars, and is often overlooked as one of the great sci-fi benchmarks. Star Wars took the adolescent fantasies and dreams of courageous stargazers; an heroic band of young rebels marching into battle against the oppressive forces of the evil Empire, backed by fanfares, explosions and cheers each time an enemy is vanquished. Being released only a year or so later, Alien is cinema's immediate counter-argument, more like the timid teenager's nightmares and fears of explorating the unknown universe; dramatic music, screams and true suspense as its foundation, but equally immersive and impressive.<br/><br/>Unlike Star Wars's explanatory crawl, Alien starts with more simplicity - spaceship Nostromo, seven crew members, returning to earth with ore. Simpler, but equally stylish. As the camera pans around the sleeping ship, the production designers' handiwork is on full display - detailed equipment in each chamber and realistic (although admittedly dated) computer systems awaken and consequently bring the crew to life. As the (again simplistic) story kicks in - signs of life on a nearby planet - so do the character arcs and depth, from the uncompromising Dallas, uneasily curious Ash, unwavering Ripley, and mistreated Parker. As we start to get a grip of the characters and their relationships, the designers don't just get another chance to shine, they excel. On the mysterious planet, the bizarre structures are both daunting and intriguing, and the life forms unique - especially during the crucial 'face' moment.<br/><br/>Back aboard the ship, we follow the alien's example and delve straight into the heart of the movie: the characters. The dinner table banter shows where the crew compliment and clash. None more so than the relationship between Ian Holm's slightly too uncaring science officer, and Sigourney Weaver's untrusting warrant officer. Tom Skerritt's captain is a bold and responsible leader, while Harry Dean Stanton's Brent is wonderfully understated. The whole cast is magnificent in their respective roles (although Veronic Cartwright's character never really develops), but by the end it's Weaver's show as the enduringly strong and infamous Ripley - smart, sophisticated and pretty fierce in a fight too.<br/><br/>Dan O'Bannon's screenplay is a masterpiece too. The dialogue never feels forced with exposition, nor too vague and unexplanatory, and is dotted with truly classic moments; the face-latch, chest burst, acid blood, android officer, and 'crew expendable' - those two words packing more punch than 99% of Hollywood's creations. The movie is masterfully executed, the pinnacle of Ridley Scott's ability - the use of light and (particularly) shadow to keep the audience's eyes constantly scouring the screen; noise and silence for true suspense and resolution, to keep your heartbeat pulsing more than the music.<br/><br/>But for all its quality elsewhere, a horror movie is only as enduring as its nemesis. The monster is perfectly created - weird and perplexing, then small and relatively insignificant, and finally huge, strong and utterly terrifying. Unlike many antagonists, its lack of weakness isn't boring and annoying, but becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on, us rooting entirely for the diminishing crew. Although Aliens is a solid follow-up, none of the (so far seven) sequels have made as good a job of showing the true ferocity and menace of the enemy as the original, nor the immense sense of relief once Ripley finally blows it away with the engine.<br/><br/>I was 17 when I first saw Alien, and for me few horror movies have come close to creating the same sense of dread and tension with such powerful performances and scary villain. Simply put, one of the greatest ever."
"Screen_Blitz","9","1","2","2 May 2017"," Ridley Scott's Alien is a scary, gritty, and influential piece of work to the science-fiction genre
","Since H.G. Wells's classic novel 'War of The Worlds', aliens have been one of the most iconic fictional creatures to stand the test of time in the science-fiction genre. This sci-fi/horror creature feature takes the trophy of not only marking a solid directorial inauguration for Ridley Scott, but also for redefining the alien subgenre. This spine-chilling alien invasion piece not only shows off Scott's versatile directing chops, but also serves as an influential classic to inspiring many sci-fi/horror tropes of the past few decades. Although some may admire the director's visceral blend of sheering suspense and startling visual effects as the movie's most valued accolade, it is difficult to argue the astonishing influence that this film has spread over the past many years; especially when you look at the large number of cheesy rip- offs Hollywood has flown at us. This film centers on a commercial crew of seven members travelling through space on a spaceship known as the Nostromo. The crew is lead by Captain Dallas (Played by Tom Skeritt) and consists of members Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), Lambert (played by Veronica Cartwright), Brett (played by Harry Dean Stanton), Kane (played by John Hurt), Ash (played by Ian Holm), and Parker (played by Yaphet Kotto). When the crew receives a distress signal from an unknown source, they soon become terrorized by a mysterious extraterrestrial force that manages to sneak their way on the ship.<br/><br/>If you picture John Carpenter's 'Halloween' and replace the masked killer with a grotesque-looking extraterrestrial and the suburban setting with the interior of a rundown spaceship, then you got this movie. This film is a terrifying ride. It focuses on the survival of seven individuals who are forced to use their intellect and weaponry to fend off against an otherwordly force that is beyond what they imagined. Ridley Scott effectively sets the action in an inspiring hodgepodge of firmly constructed atmosphere and a surplus of horrifying special effects. Similar to Steven Spielberg's method in 'Jaws', Scott makes a smart decision of not displaying the monster throughout the entirety the film, but generating a chilling wind of suspense that effectively builds up when the extraterrestrial creature finally shows itself on screen. When the creature reveals itself, it is brutally terrifying especially when the considered the surrealistic design of the sinister creature. And best of all, the creature serves perhaps not just as a cold-blooded killer but a moving force of the sinister atmosphere. Scott's methodology awards us with a powerful string of scares and thrills including the infamous chest-bursting scene. As for the acting department, the cast does mostly fine, but the shortage of character development does serve as a small hinder. The only one who manages to sustain a proper characterization is Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley who displays plenty of grit and heart in her tough female role.<br/><br/>Alien marks not only a scary, heart-pounding science-fiction set piece, but an influential sci-fi/horror cinematic entry. It is an amazing work of art that boasts the incredible talent of visionary director Ridley Scott. Although it certainly shows its age, it is effective enough to leave moviegoers pining for more."
"funeralfortheliving","10","1","2","1 May 2017"," Beware of the Mummy's Curse
","Ridley Scott made one of the best Mummy movies ever made in 1979's Alien. It takes from the myths and reality of the spread of germs accumulated in a sealed up tomb perceived by ancient societies as ""Curses"" and turns them into art inspired by truth. Just like in any Mummy movie it begins with humans finding ancient technology. In the same way some pyramids served as tombs you will notice in Alien the Space Jockey is a perfectly mummified being. People who have researched Giger's inspiration for the Jockey found he designed it off an ark type hieroglyphic that represented a vessel to carry one into the afterlife. Also the function of a Mummy. In ancient times when people would break into tombs they would immediately enter and be exposed to germs that could kill a person. This was the foundation for the Mummy's curse. Alien's takes that concept and brings it into the far out and beyond our capability concepts of science fiction. Another word for germ is bug so it makes sense that the film makers choose a bug for the form of the alien creatures. You will notice that just like an airborne germ the alien is contracted by a face huger cleverly designed to resemble a breathing apparatus. Just like germs the face huger enters through the mouth and lays its egg in the hosts chest. This is why the creature goes in through a breathing apparatus and stops near the lungs and the creature that is born is called a chest burster. It is all metaphoric of the airborne germ in a freshly opened tomb. I had never thought about this before until I went on a spree of mummy films. No one else has pointed this out to my knowledge but it would be interesting to see if the film makers themselves explained it to anybody. It gives me a new take on the film, makes so much sense and establishes the creativity that went into this film and I felt I should share it with all film watchers so they can enjoy it too. Now the people who wondered what a cat was doing in space have an answer."

","In preparation for alien covenant later this month I am aiming to watch the alien films and review them, starting with alien which is a great horror film. The premise of the film sees a group of human travellers come across an alien planet and an alien life that threatens there very existence. Sigourney weaver plays Ripley in this film and she does a great job, her character goes through a great amount of progression throughout and you really care about her character due to her strong performance. Ian Holm is really young in this film and really good in the film, his performance is really interesting to watch especially as you see the direction his character takes. The rest of the crew are really good too including john hurt, this is a horror film where you don't want to see the team die which helps the strength of the film. The alien itself is the perfect villain for this film, it stalks the crew in interesting ways and you are interested in seeing it hunt this crew down. The story is incredibly simple but it really works for this film, seeing the crew trying to survive this alien can be enthralling at times. Also some of the twists make this a more compelling film and helps make this a more unique watch. The script has some slightly interesting dialogue especially some good banter between the team towards the beginning off the film. But there isn't really anything special about the script or iconic lines like aliens has. The style of the film has some great tension building in it as you are in terror watching it. However, the pacing in this film is a bit poor, the first act is a bit of a drag and moves really slowly and I feel it does really take a while to get going. Overall this is a great film and if you are a fan of survival horror films then this is a must see, I am not but I still really enjoy this film so give it a chance."

After Star Wars broke new ground for scifi at the movies, along came Alien in 1979; and this film was a totally different beast.

Little do they know that they're about to bring back with them the most dangerous creature in the universe: The Xenomorph, an alien that bleeds acid and can hide easily in such a vast mining ship.<br/><br/>Scott made himself a filmmaking star overnight with this film.

It was love, curiosity, admiration and fear at first sight.<br/><br/>""Alien"" is basically a monster/killer movie in space, but all the layers and phenomenal execution add so much to it. It seizes to be just a genre flick, and reaches toward something else. It is equally intriguing as it is scary. The sci-fi mystery elements are so powerful that even if it's not a thinking man's sci-fi movie, it makes your imagination soar in a way that only a handful of movies can achieve.<br/><br/>Today, it has tons of sequels and as I'm typing this, it'll soon have its second prequel. The monster itself is almost a celebrity, and there is no escape from an overly commercialized franchise that has desperately been trying to capture what made the original film so great. However, they never managed to do that. Not even with James Cameron's ""Aliens"", which has become almost a cartoon over time. It's still a very good action movie, but time catches up to every film. Except the original.<br/><br/>Some movies stand the test of time. ""Alien"" is one of them. It's just as amazing today as it was back in the day. This is not just nostalgia talking. Every set, every matte painting, all the props, all the robotics/animatronics and effects are absolutely beautiful (except for one and just one shot). Not only do they hold up today, but they have originality to them. When you add beautiful cinematography by Derek Vanlint and the visual direction of Ridley Scott, you get a ridiculously gorgeous film. You get real imagination, real craft. Something that makes you wonder. No mass-produced CGI, no executive-driven soulless copycat designs, no cookie-cutter execution, none of it. Even the atmospheric music stands out. It's all so great, and so very real. <br/><br/>Talking about real, the actors are fantastic. ""Alien"" does what almost no movies can't seem to do anymore (and what none of its sequels did after it): the characters feel like real people. These are not celebrities reading lines, these feel like real working-class people, basically truckers in space. Every single one of them is amazing, no need to mention specific names. The whole cast is spectacular, and nobody had an ego. If someone did, it certainly doesn't show. The natural performances keep you invested in every scene. All of it is held together by the well-written dialogue.<br/><br/>Today, we're well aware how beautiful and disturbing H.R. Giger's Alien design is. In this movie, it's the best it has ever been. It's mysterious, it's ominous, it's strangely beautiful. It's not a video game monster running at you, because at times it just...seems to mind its own business, doing whatever it does. It feels real too, not just the people. When you add the magnificent sets, props and lighting/camera tricks, you can't help but immerse yourself.<br/><br/>The amount of memorable scenes is absurd. You don't remember them because someone said a funny one-liner, but because they genuinely impressed you, whether you noticed it at the time or not. Not only all the pieces work, they elevate each other. I can't help but think that some happy accidents had to take place, since nobody knew they were making a masterpiece for a genre that was considered mostly trash. Lightning in a bottle? Perhaps.<br/><br/>This is Ridley Scott's best film. ""Blade Runner"" takes the second place. After that, he hasn't directed a masterpiece. Even ""The Martian"", although critically acclaimed, is just a formulaic popcorn movie with very little cinematic value when compared to these two. Perhaps he won't direct any more masterpieces in his life, but even if he didn't, he directed this. For which I'm thankful. ""Alien"" made me really love movies. And after just watching it for the 30th (estimate) time, I'm still in love with it.<br/><br/>If you're young and generally suspicious of old movies, but still interested in this, it's time to step down from that fence. It's time to watch this classic. If you're old and somehow missed ""Alien"", return to the past with this masterpiece, and you'll remember why things indeed were better then."
"tristan99","10","1","2","17 April 2017"," One of the best Movies of all time, Period.
","Alien is one of the best movies to have ever been made, hands down. Not only does it combine great suspense with music, but the acting is also amazing. The plot is pretty straightforward, an alien stows away on a spaceship with a mere 7 crew members, and after harvesting itself from Kane, escapes onto the ship and silently picks off the crew one by one. This was one of the very first horror films I ever watched and after watching tons of others, this movie still stands above most for me. Every time I watch it, I always find something new and I never stop being scared. Sigourney Weaver is also one of my favorite actresses of all time. In my opinion, this is a must see for people who love not only horror films, but films in general. Hands down an amazing film."
"zkonedog","5","1","2","8 March 2017"," Depends On Your POV
","There is no question that Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" is a landmark film in the history of science fiction cinema. However, your overall enjoyment of the film will likely depend on whether or not you can fling yourself back to the late 1970s.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Alien"" sees the crew of a future commercial spaceship stumble upon an alien creature so horrifying that it defies description. After worming its way aboard the ship, the grotesque alien proceeds to wreak havoc on vessel and crew alike.<br/><br/>Put simply, there are two primary trains of thought regarding the greatness of this movie (both of which include strains of the truth):<br/><br/>1. As a stand-alone film, the movie isn't all that great. There is no context, no character development, and the ""landscape"" (while perhaps creative in its sparseness) is quite bleak. The special effects are also quite dated, and (in retrospect) the plot has now been done so many times in so many different forms that it has almost become a cliché of itself.<br/><br/>2. Despite lacking in overall plot and effects, ""Alien"" does (without a doubt) contain some of the most seminal scenes in cinema history. It was (to my knowledge) the first film to really perfect the ""killing-machine space organism"" plot line and bring it to the mainstream. Plus, the scenes with the alien that are now so well-known are still shocking/provocative all these years later. If you saw this movie in the theaters in 1979, you were likely blown away by it.<br/><br/>Thus, very likely your overall impression of this movie will be determined by whether or not you can suspend time for about two hours. If judged by today's standards, this movie falls a bit flat. However, if seen in the context of its contemporaries, it is truly groundbreaking."

","How can Alien not get 10 stars? I expect that it's a little too serious for some. Too slow moving for others. Too dramatic. Too much dialog. Not enough 'monster'. But for me this is perfect. Leave the scary stuff to the imagination of the viewer. Camera-work is sublime: Claustrophobic. Dark. Intense. Shadows and light play together to make the viewer's eyes dart around the screen trying to catch a glimpse of where the wicked predator may be, like some sinister game of Where's Wally. You will jump every time you watch it. There are four horror movies that everyone must watch before they die. All have flawless acting. Flawless directing. Flawless script.

The animatronics, the exposed bone structure, and vertebrae, are all part of the epic visual effects for the alien franchise.

"tankace","9","1","2","5 February 2017"," Space and Horror all praise Lovecraft!
","To honor the father of horror I thought to review some film which has taken some inspiration from his work. Although a direct good adaptation of his work, apart from Re-animated, many directors over the years have used his elements to create some of the best horror film in history. My personal favorite is Alien from 1979.<br/><br/>But some back-story for its creation is necessary:<br/><br/>In 1978 in Ridley Scott had a food poisoning he was send to a hospital to take out that infection and he has said many times how terrified he was having such a alien thing in his body and the damage it made to him and so using that experience and adding some elements from H.P. Lovecraft one of the most historic horror-science fiction was made: Alien! The title itself is fascinating for alien means both an exeterrestrial as we usually use it and the original meaning is foreign, something we are unfamiliar with.<br/><br/>This unfamiliarity has its roots of the elements of Lovecraft, which the crew of Alien used,with the most important been the fear of insignificance, the terror that we now face something that we can't say for sure what it is, what it can do and if we can beat. In short cosmic horror, the best kind of horror and even 80 years after the dead of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. And this flick did more that enough to made the audience fear desperate ,trapped and out of breath from fear.<br/><br/>A note for new horror director (Who do a really good job with flick like Oculus, Don't Breath, The Witch and my man Del Toro with Crimsob Peak). If you want to create an excellent film take notes from Alien and you will be in a good way. As far as I know horror movies are beginning to come back and I am glad that we passed the era of torture porn. As for the jump-scares the eleventh hour is close!<br/><br/>And now for the film itself ,this one Shining, Aliens ,Jaws and Oculus are the only movies that have made my crawl out of horror. The atmosphere is perfect the environment in the space-craft is eerie and all the actors do a fantastic job. As for the creature itself ,go watch man ,just that.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is among the many films that you have to watch before you die and worth every minute. Also the extended edition is also perfect unlike with other cases George Lucas!"
"cdjh-81125","8","1","2","5 January 2017"," Definitive Sci Fi Brilliance
","When speaking about the greatest science fiction movies of all time Ridley Scott's Alien is a film that will come up in conversation and its very much deserving of such praise as this is a fantastically executed and atmospheric film that I truly found to be brilliant. For one this film looks fantastic, the interior design of the Nostromo is designed perfectly its not flashy or unbelievable but a realistic version of a space craft. The special effects are also perfect most likely (similarly to George Lucas with Star Wars) chose not to rely on them to much but instead use them sparingly using real life models to make it seem more realistic. The design of the titular Alien is also perfect, the design makes it look terrifying and imposing. The tension in this film is done perfectly due to Ridley Scott's masterful direction of this film made he made it very claustrophobic through long takes and wide shots that revealed to us just how little space there was for the characters to run. Also like the special effects he used the Alien itself sparingly we only really so it up close a few times which puts the viewer more in the shoes of the characters and makes the film all the more unpredictable. Another thing this will did very well was get out a truly fantastic central performance from Sigourney Weaver who is just cast to perfection in this film she's a strong and intelligent lead that is extremely likable and was the perfect conduit for the audience to experience the horror. There is never a moment from the first act on wards where the viewer feels completely safe and it made this film much more enjoyable. When such a menacing force such as the Alien in this film is built up its hard to make its eventual demise satisfying but this film did it, it was built up perfectly to the point where it seemed unlikely that the protagonists would succeed. However my biggest issue with the film is it's first act as while the slow pace worked for the second and third act in the beginning it did bore me and didn't grab my attention like the rest of the film did. <br/><br/>Alien is a fantastic film things done in this film have been repeated in countless other Sci Fi films to this date, it's got one of the most effective uses if atmosphere ever in a film, I loved the central character and there was never a point past the third act where I felt completely safe. The only real problem with the film was the beginning of the first act but beyond that this film has no other flaw. <br/><br/>87%/A-"
"avatar-85678","5","1","2","1 January 2017"," Horror was there but not the Terror
","I'm just starting to get into horror movie but what I know about the genre is that there are many types of horror. <br/><br/>As Stephen King once said, there are many types of fear. Here are the two important : ""Horror: the unnatural, spiders the size of bears, the dead waking up and walking around, it's when the lights go out and something with claws grabs you by the arm. And the last and worse one: Terror, when you come home and notice everything you own had been taken away and replaced by an exact substitute. It's when the lights go out and you feel something behind you, you hear it, you feel its breath against your ear, but when you turn around, there's nothing there""<br/><br/>Alien uses the second type of fear horror. It's this Alien guy who is killing everyone.<br/><br/>But just in my opinion the fear of terror would have been better. <br/><br/>Next I think the sound design is great but it lack of volume, of fullness destroys the atmosphere and leaves you without any fear of what could happen."
"mortimerdiego","8","1","2","30 December 2016"," eyes riveted to the screen
","For a film that came out in 1979, the visual quality was amazing. I was tense literally the ENTIRE time I was watching the movie, from the moment the letters of ALIEN coalesced onto the backdrop of that planet to the very end. Google ""Alien"" and you'll see the basic plot summary, that of a And Then There Were None device of characters being killed off one by one. Knowing that, you know, you already know and are put in suspense before the movie even starts, that characters are going to die, that people will be killed by an alien. Thus the title Alien.<br/><br/>The soundtrack matches perfectly with the tension. The orchestra plays sharp notes suddenly at the right moments. When the music begins to keen that recurring motif, you know someone's gonna die. You keep telling certain characters to not do certain things. How stupid we are, humans. How weak we are, humans. We can do essentially nothing with our bodies against unknown species from different worlds, with physiques and adaptive capabilities we can never hope to have. <br/><br/>The acting? Oh it's perfect as well. Like Star Wars did for Harrison Ford, this film made Sigourney Weaver famous. How she reacts to the increasingly horrific situation is masterful, very human. Do we endanger the lives of our fellow crew to save another, or lose that one person to save the crew? What can we do, really, against something unknown? It is the unknown that scares us most, for the known can be analyzed, evaluated, and at least gauged in terms of danger. But for the unknown, the possibilities are endless.<br/><br/>I found myself imagining myself in one of those crew member's shoes, but with a super power so that I could better tackle the alien. But sadly we humans don't have super powers. And that's what precisely makes Alien such a superb flick, for it depicts a struggle for survival between weak humans and an alien that's scary as hell. Watching Alien is like watching Jaws -- you never know when it will strike again."
"Cameronius_113","9","1","2","10 December 2016"," Great atmosphere, great characters, great movie
","The movie has a great, tensional atmosphere which is built up extremely well; many scenes are either quiet or silent which adds to the sense of isolation and the fact that their enemy could be absolutely anywhere. This is quite a slow-paced movie (nearly the first five minutes are all silent shots of panning through locations). Usually this would be a weak point but the pace works for this film as it adds to the amount of tension. Also, because of the slow pace it gives you time to appreciate how well done each small part of the film is done and makes everything memorable. The practical effects are great for the time, the alien itself is a prime example; when I first saw it I was stunned by how real it looked and to think that this was nearly 40 years ago at the time of writing this is even more stunning. There's also more effects that I loved but I'll let you experience them when you see them yourself so hopefully you'll be as equally as impressed as I was. Ellen Ripley is considered one of the greatest female leads in movies of all time and that is for good reason. She was a strong and intelligent lead and was also quite relatable at the same time. Movies I really like are ones which I guess are 'small' so they don't really move around that far if you understand what I'm talking about; they give every aspect of the film the attention they deserve and usually end up as a more interesting movie. This movie is a prime example of a great one of these. This is usually regarded as a horror film, hence the tagline 'In space, no one can hear you scream'. However, there's nothing really too scary here and as I said earlier is full of tension and relies on surprises and shocks rather than scares. Overall, this was a great movie with an amazing well-built up atmosphere and gives every aspect of the film the attention it deserves, from the characters, the writing and the effects. I would highly recommend this film. 8.6/10 Who else loved Jones the Cat?"

","Alien is a classic science fiction thriller that would not have been nearly as successful without H. R. Gieger's beautifully twisted mind. This movie invented/cemented horror techniques that are now used in almost every single horror movie made since, and the genre would not be the same without it. My biggest complaint about this movie is that it loses a lot on a second viewing. The movie builds suspense by being extremely slow, up until the alien appears which is great for a first viewing, but if you know where the plot is going beforehand then it seems needlessly slow. That being said, this movie has been referenced hundreds of times in TV, books, and even other movies, and with good reason too! this movie is unforgettable because it creates such a terrifying situation with such high stakes and to give those stakes meaning, the movie isn't afraid to kill off characters. All in all, Alien has technique down to a science, and when added to the amazing cast and the great score; you end up with a masterpiece."

","This film has tons of positives going for it. On first viewing, I wasn't too impressed by it, but on later viewings, I grew to appreciate it more and more. The art direction/special effects, were outstanding, including of course Giger's amazing designs. The acting was very good on all accounts, especially by Sigourney Weaver. The direction, was very well done by Mr. Scott, whom it is said convinced the studio to give the film a bigger budget. The music was excellent, paying homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. The atmosphere was fittingly sombre and realistic, unlike the rather puerile, operatic ""Star Wars"". I was disappointed by some dumb horror-movie character decisions in the plot near the end (eg.; threatened with imminent death, Ripley goes running around the ship looking for a cat ! and the tough Black man doesn't blow away the creature along with the inept Veronica Cartwright character. He didn't seem, like such a stupid softy throughout the movie. My main disappointment however, was that the ""Alien"" wasn't given more explanation. Did it actually eat the people, that it killed, and if not, why did it kill, if it wasn't necessary? Also, it displayed no particular intelligence, not even, as much as, the cat. I know, it was just meant to be a killer monster, but it would have been interesting, being an alien, if it had a bit more depth. None-the-less an excellent film. James Cameron's sequel was also excellent, if a little over-blown. Even the third sequel was good. I think, that the excellent actors really gave life to all three movies, especially having the consistency of Ms. Weaver, as the main character. She's one smart lady."
"zardoz-13","10","1","2","18 September 2016"," One of the Scariest Horror Movies of All Time!!!
","Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" ranks as one of the greatest sci-fi horror sagas of all time. If you haven't seen this landmark epic that spawned a franchise, then you haven't experienced genuine dread. Happily, the years haven't robbed this terrific gem of its skin crawling repulsion. Three sequels that followed in its wake, but only James Cameron's ""Aliens"" came close to replicating its intensity. Like any good film, ""Alien"" boasts several surprises that will catch you off guard and alarm you. Most of the action is confined to the murky confines of a shadowy spacecraft with passages galore. Reportedly, Scott and scenarist Dan O'Bannon were influenced by director Edward L. Cahn's ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"" (1958) and Mario Bava's ""Planet of the Vampires"" (1964) with Barry Sullivan. It is easy to see the resemblance in the plot between ""Alien"" and Cahn's epic where a monster boards a spacecraft before it blasts off and the crew spent the entire flight battling the monster as it corners the heroes. On the other hand, the set design in the Bava film is virtually replicated in Scott's film. Mind you, neither of those two inspirations is anywhere near as chilling as ""Alien."" The eponymous monster is a memorable predator that you won't soon forget. Indeed, coursing through the veins of this lethal life-form is acid that eats through the metal hull of the ship.<br/><br/>In Scott's atmospheric film takes place in the year 2122. A commercial cargo vessel named the Nostromo is heading home when the ship's computer receives an SOS distress signal, and the seven members constituting the crew awaken from hyper-sleep in their individual sleeping pods and goes to a planet to investigate the signal. They land on this inhospitable planet and check things out. One of the crew, Kane (John Hurt of ""Heaven's Gate"") finds himself in an eerie setting, a garden within the hull of a derelict ship that contain curious organisms in small silos. Kane makes the mistake of peering too closely at one of them and the dome shape of the egg peels itself back ominously and something icky surges out of it and penetrates the face plate of his helmet. This nasty organism attaches itself to Kane's face, while another part of it plunges down his gullet, and its snake-like tail coils around his neck. Kane's shipmates rush their fallen colleague back aboard the Nostromo despite the protests of Science Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver of ""Ghostbusters"") who doesn't think that Kane should be brought aboard. Ripley fears that Kane has been infected with something hazardous. Nostromo ship captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt of ""M.A.S.H."") intervenes on Kane's behalf and allows him to be brought aboard. They confine Kane to quarantine so they can analyze the creature clinging tenaciously to his face. Miraculously, the creature strangling Kane releases him, collapses to the floor and scuttles away like vermin. Kane revives none the worse for wear, and everybody celebrates his recovery.<br/><br/>The sense of relief proves at best ephemeral. While the crew is indulging in a gluttonously repast, Kane coughs and then sprawls onto their table and goes into a palsy. As his shipmates struggle to restrain him, Kane heaves and a pickle-shaped demon erupts from his chest and tears off into the shop. At this point, the dwarf-like critter grows into a huge, ugly creature with a double-set of ravenous jaws. One by one, it eliminates the shipmates until only Ripley is left. In this respect, Scott's grisly film resembles a slasher film because Ripley qualifies as 'the final girl.' Ripley manages to activate the self-destruction phase, after she rescues her cat, and slips into an escape shuttle. Unfortunately, Dallas dies during the final moments after the self-destruct sequence is set into motion. Ripley and Jones make it into the shuttle and prepare for the long voyage back to Earth. Little does poor Ripley realize that the alien beast escaped from the Nostromo before it was obliterated. Eventually, she is able to blow the monster out of the ship. ""Alien"" garnered an Oscar for Best Special Effects."

Yes, it's obvious that Alien is inspired by works such as Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey but it takes the visuals and that lonely concentrated feeling of outer space to another level. Ridley Scott did a tremendous job in directing only his second feature film about a group of ordinary people being terrorized by a hideous breed of monster. The creativity of on how the monsters evolve throughout its life stages is just as intriguing as how they look aesthetically. The movie develops itself quite nicely, a slow start with great details pertaining to the character but it's not long after the gory mayhem ensues.

I love the somewhat simplicity of the plot, and the great special effects, I only have a couple complaints. As much as I love this film every time I watch it, when ever it gets near the end I always ask myself, why does she go back for the cat? If it were me, I'm not going back for the cat with this killer alien on board and frankly I think a lot of people would agree with me, it doesn't make a lot of sense. Sure maybe you could excuse it if she had some kind of close attachment to the cat and they showed that in the film, but they don't, it's not until the end of the movie when Ripley says "" oh I've got to go back to get Jones!"" I'm sorry but as much as I love this film I always find that part hard to believe and it always bothers me. The other problem I have isn't quite as bad. I feel like the movie doesn't have enough of the actual Alien and also would have benefited greatly if they actual made it longer instead of its 114 minute runtime. I feel like they could have had more scenes with the alien chasing someone as opposed to Ripley running around trying to get to the shuttle and not actually even seeing the Alien except one time and the Alien doesn't even see her when she sees it. I've watched the 2003 directors cut and actually liked it a little better because of the additional scenes even though there is not many. Overall Alien is a very good film and a classic."

","Alien is a 1979 British-American science-fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott, and starring Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto. The film's title refers to a highly aggressive extraterrestrial creature that stalks and kills the crew of a spaceship. Dan O'Bannon wrote the screenplay from a story he wrote with Ronald Shusett, drawing influence from previous works of science fiction and horror. The film was produced by Gordon Carroll, David Giler and Walter Hill through their Brandywine Productions and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Giler and Hill made revisions and additions to the script. Shusett was executive producer. The eponymous Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the human aspects of the film. Alien launched the Alien franchise and is chronologically the first of the main series, with the prequel series set in an earlier timeframe.<br/><br/>Alien received both critical acclaim and box office success, receiving an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects,[10][11] Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction for Scott, and Best Supporting Actress for Cartwright,[12] and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, along with numerous other award nominations.[13] It has remained highly praised in subsequent decades, being considered one of the greatest films of all time. In 2002 the film was deemed ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. [13][14][15] In 2008, it was ranked as the seventh-best film in the science fiction genre by the American Film Institute, and as the 33rd greatest film of all time by Empire magazine.[16][17]<br/><br/>The success of Alien spawned a media franchise of novels, comic books, video games, and toys. It also launched Weaver's acting career by providing her with her first lead role, and the story of her character Ripley's encounters with the Alien creatures became the thematic thread that ran through the sequels."
"jscherber","9","1","2","25 June 2016"," One of the best of both genres.
","Alien follows a spacecraft in the future that receives a distress call from an ancient spacecraft and accidentally let's an unstoppable aggressive alien creature onto the ship. The movie is just as much horror as science fiction, which is done very well, as the focus is on suspense, atmosphere, jump scares, and excitement. The story is creative and interesting, with a lot of shocking plot points. The design of the alien, spacecrafts, and planet, as well as the music also helps the eerie mood. One of the only problems is that, though the performances are decent, the character's besides Ripley and Ash are kind of bland and uninteresting. Overall, I think this could be one of the best movies of both the horror and science fiction genre. I would highly recommend it to fans of both."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","2","16 June 2016"," Perhaps the film that best handles, tackles and tickles our most universal fears...
","""Alien"". A short word still resonating among movie lovers as one of the most frightening and nightmarish experiences ever, and deservedly so. Indeed, aren't our most common fears strangely connected to a possible alien presence? Why are we afraid of the dark, if not for the fear that something might touch us or jump at us? Why can't some people be alone? Fear of intruders. Agoraphobia? The anonymity of the crowd makes easier targets. Claustrophobia? Incapability to escape.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" intelligently explores these fears thanks to its brilliant concept, generally summed up as '""Jaws"" in a spacecraft' and it does have a kinship with the no-less groundbreaking shark film. But the monster was in the water, so as menacing and oppressing as he was, you could just choose not to swim. This time, the monster is inside the spacecraft and the spacecraft is in space, it's a tricky situation where the monster won't go away and the protagonists can't either. And since the Alien's blood is a corrosive acid working like universal solvent, jettisoning him is the only option, impossible without a confrontation.<br/><br/>But I'm already in the plot while there's more to appreciate than the monster and its effects. First of all, this is a serious film. Its aesthetic goals match ""Star Wars"", the film that set new standards of excellence in art-set decorations. And the cast is believable and relatable, you have the veteran Captain played by Tom Skerrit, the more blue-collar executioners played by Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton, executive (and so ill-fated) Kane, played by John Hurt, and the scientist named Ash (Ian Holm), the two female crew members are the young Veronica Cartwright and naturally Sigourney Weaver in her breakthrough performance as Ellen Ripley... and for a little touch of cuteness, there's little Jones, the cat. <br/><br/>Like in another odyssey of the same year (""Apocalypse Now"") Scott didn't try to put some bankable or glamorous actors in the story, they all look tough, worn-out, professionals, definitely not Hollywood material. You can feel the difference between ""Alien"" and ""The Martian"", Ridley Scott's last film where most crew members are young and fresh looking, starting with their leader played by Jessica Chastain. Chastain did fine in the film but wouldn't a woman like Ellen Ripley be more believable? (and Weaver was younger than Chastain in the film). ""Alien"" is a film where the priority is the story and beyond the dazzling visual special effects, the film works because it never takes the easy way.<br/><br/>A telling aspect of the film's quality is the slow pacing, it takes its time before each effect. We watch the crew waking up one by one from stasis after receiving a signal from the ship central computer MOTHER (is it an SOS or a warning?), they argue about going there. Parker invokes the need for extra-payment in case they make a detour as the mission is commercial and doesn't include any scientific requests. They eventually go to the wreck and discover the Aliens ""leathery eggs"". Then,an octopus-like creature breaks Kane's helmet and gets stuck to his head. The film picks off. And at that moment, Ripley stops being a crew member among many others, she raises her voice and insists on putting Kane in quarantine. She didn't even see the Alien that she already hates it (one of the series' endearing trademarks).<br/><br/>Ash opens the door, much to Ripley's displeasure. The creature is in the spaceship, but it's still a matter of ten minutes before the most memorable part of the film happens but see how it's all set-up. Kane strangely recovers from his misadventure, so just when we took for granted he was dead, he gains consciousness back and we feel happy for him, a feeling making his demise even more atrocious. During the last meal, where we enjoy the last moment where they're all smiling, Kane starts having convulsions, and then some weird creature busts out of his chest, and what we get is one of the most iconic horror moments in history. The creature escapes letting the crew, and the viewers, shocked and stunned. And I wonder how film-goers must have felt in the theaters when the darkness made one with the ship's.<br/><br/>""Alien"" exploits its nightmarish feel to the fullest including the infamous tag-line: ""In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream"". And just when you think they might get information on how to get rid of the monster; Ripley learns from Ash that the creature is a priority while the crew is expendable. His description of the monster is just chilling ""a perfection only matched by his hostility"" but reveals what Scott did with ""Alien"", besides opening a series that would decline in quality, he created one of the most iconic monster villains of all time, embodying whatever we can fear: intruder, presence in the dark, not simply ugly but increasingly ugly appearance, and a total thirst for survival and destruction. The creature is so special that anyone who encounters him is paralyzed with fear or screams out of terror, this is the essence of evil. <br/><br/>But all these effects would have been fruitless if Scott didn't also care for the casting, writing and directing. After all, we never really totally see the creature, just like in ""Jaws"", the effects are there thanks to its suggested presence, POV and Jerry Goldsmith's score. And that's what Cinema is about, showing what is needed but making the unseen more effective. Just do the experience, you're be less scared if someone came into your house and made noise than if you were in your house and told that someone was there without you noticing it. It's a thin line, but it's the same that separates between action and suspense. The sequel would be a great action movie, the original is a masterpiece of suspense."
"uroshnor54","6","1","2","28 March 2014"," Okay But Not Great
","BLADE RUNNER is my favorite movie of all-time and just for that I think Ridley Scott is a great director. But ALIEN was really underwhelming.<br/><br/>First of all, it's not scary. That's my biggest problem with the movie. I read somewhere that back in 1979 people actually ran out of the theaters because they thought it was so scary. I guess it wouldn't be fair of me to judge them. I watched the movie on DVD, not in a theater. And the most shocking scenes are pretty famous and I'll admit that that takes away quite a bit of the suspense. Still, I was kind of disappointed that it wasn't scary. <br/><br/>Roger Ebert said in his Great Movies review of ALIEN:<br/><br/>""A recent version of this story would have hurtled toward the part where the alien jumps on the crew members. Today's slasher movies, in the sci-fi genre and elsewhere, are all pay-off and no buildup...It isn't the slashing that we enjoy. It's the waiting for the slashing.""<br/><br/>I don't like movies with a lot of pay-off and very little buildup. But I also don't like movies with a lot of buildup and very little pay-off. ALIEN is a movie in the latter group, so it's kind of boring. Good movies, especially good horror and/or thriller movies, have to have about an equal amount of buildup and pay-off. <br/><br/>Take JURASSIC PARK, for example. You don't get to see the dinosaurs for quite a while. But when you finally see the dinosaurs, YOU SEE THE DINOSAURS. (Sorry, about the all caps. I'm just trying to emphasize what I'm typing. I'd use italics if IMDb had them.) And the first dinosaurs you see are majestic but peaceful herbivores. You don't get to see the Dilophosaurus, the Velociraptors, or the Tyrannosaurus Rex for even longer after the main characters arrive at the park. But you can see them just fine when they arrive. The T. Rex especially makes a great entrance. <br/><br/>The Xenomorph has a great design but it's always shown in darkness and the whole thing is never seen. It has too little screen time. And when it's shown in its entirety at the end, it's a bit disappointing. You can see it's only a guy in a suit. I kind of wish that they showed it all AND that it looked more realistic. I suppose I couldn't have had it both ways, though, considering the movie was made in the late 70s.<br/><br/>ALIEN also doesn't make very much sense. The facehuggers come out of eggs, right? How long can they stay in the eggs before they need to attach themselves to a host? How does the embryo control the facehugger? Is the facehugger a part of the embryo that is abandoned like a snakeskin or is it more like an egg sac? How are the eggs laid without a host in the first place? In the deleted scene, it looks like Dallas and Brett were being prepared to have eggs implanted in them so it seems like eggs can only be laid inside a host. If they are laid in a host, what happens to the facehugger? Or are only embryos inserted into the host?<br/><br/>Some of the special effects are pretty dated, especially the scene in which Parker decapitates Ash and it's revealed that Ash is an android. The sets are all great except for the room where Dallas and Ripley communicate with Mother, the Nostromo's computer.<br/><br/>I'm giving the movie 6/10 stars because there are quite a few great things in it. Like I said, the Xenomorph does have an awesome design and most of the sets are great. The matte paintings are amazing. The Nostromo is, in my opinion, the coolest movie spaceship. The Jerry Goldsmith score is pretty good. All of the actors did a pretty good job. Sigourney Weaver was great as Ripley but I think my favorite performance was Veronica Cartwright's. I think we'd all like to think that we'd handle the situation in ALIEN like Ripley does. Although you can see she's scared, she does manage to blow up the Nostromo and she defeats the Xenomorph in the end. Maybe some of us would be like Ripley. I'd honestly probably be more like Lambert, and by that I mean I'd be completely terrified. So I could identify with Lambert more than I could with Ripley.<br/><br/>Even though I didn't like ALIEN as much as I hoped I would, I can see why many people do like it. Many of the problems that I had with the movie are probably what many people love about it."
"LeonLouisRicci","9","1","2","12 July 2013"," A New Screen Monster Is Born
","The Computers are the only thing in this Movie that seems dated. Everything else looks like it was made last Year. The dripping, rustic Spaceships and their interiors have that colorless, washed out look that todays Movie makers pass off as template and style. Then there's the Alien.<br/><br/>A Modern Monster Design that has found its place among the Classics like Frankenstein and Dracula. It is a nightmarish Creature that announces itself without Heart or Soul as we know it. It is primordial and Reptilian.<br/><br/>The Films influence is undeniable as were both Audience and Critical praising. There were other earlier excursions into Sci-Fi and Horror that this remotely resembles, but it is a fresh vision of Suspense with a Modern dose of Violence. Without question though, these things are expertly concocted to make the Movie maintain a sense of the slightly familiar with new twists of Terror.<br/><br/>Modern Viewers have a more cynical approach to the pacing and the shadowy threat that resides in these dank corridors. Mostly because Movies like this have become about as subtle as a suitcase nuke. Patience is a virtue here and this is a reminder that not everything has to be flamboyantly fissionable to be fashionable."

","Alien is a special film, a hybrid of sci-fi, horror and thriller. A film that made Ridley Scott a Hollywood player, made Sigourney Weaver's career and a started a multi-million dollar franchise.<br/><br/>Set in the future, a commercial mining spaceship, Nostromo, is on its way back to Earth and the crew is in a state of hibernation. The ship's computer receives a signal for a foreign species and wakes up the crew. Under law the crew have to investigate. After crashing on a planet some of the crew go to explore the site of a crashed ship, with one very dead alien on board. One of the crew members, Kane (John Hurt) has the misfortune to find a number of eggs in ship and gets attacked by a Facehugger. Kane is taken back to Nostromo, and the science officer Ash (Ian Holm) tries to study it. He can't remove the Facehugger because it would strangle Kane, and cutting it off isn't an option because it has acid blood. After Kane seems to be fine, but whilst eating the Chestburster kills him and scares the crew in a classic scene. The crew go on the hunt, facing the ultimate predator. But it's not just the alien that the crew should worry about, with a conspiracy led by their own company/employers and a traitor within their mitts.<br/><br/>Alien is considered a classic and I admit it is very good, but it's my second film in the franchise. The point of this film is the suspense, nothing knowing what's going to happen and has some excellent scares and scenes. Ridley Scott directs with subtly and slowly builds up the film, keeping you on the edge of your seat and interested at work's going on the screen. It is eerie and perfectly well done. As a horror film its one of the best ever made. It's an excellent sci-fi, Ridley Scott creates a break, dark world, showing space travel can be hard and unglamourous, almost an anti-Star Wars film. The story is simple and strong, a spaceship crew find an alien. But what makes Alien better is that the alien is just a wild animal who want to kill and eat. It's not an intelligence life-form who wants to conqueror Earth. The characters are developed and the conspiracy adds to the story, having an anti-big business message. Another theme that are looked at by this film are fear of the unknown, the future of space exploration and the fear of male rape and pregnancy (i.e. what happens to John Hurt). The art direction is excellent, with great sets and model work, adding to the dark Star Wars feel to the film. There is great special effects for the time.<br/><br/>They is a good cast to the film. Sigourney Weaver is obviously good and must have loved the role seeing she played it for times. There are great English actors, John Hurt and Ian Holm, both always good to see. Tom Skerritt and Yaphet Kotto are also noticeable and worthy of mention.<br/><br/>An excellent film for horror and sci-fi fans. A must see. Alien and Aliens are the best in the series and it's best to stop there."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","2","9 June 2008"," ""Alien"" is born where sci-fi/horror meets superb artistic craftsmanship
","A skeptic of ""Alien"" would quickly dismiss it on premise alone as unoriginal and gimmicky. Yes, it could be described in one way as ""Jaws"" on a spaceship, but director Ridley Scott takes a solid script from Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett and turns it into something remarkable and memorable, something more than just run-of-the-mill. What you have instead is the most popular and revered extra-terrestrial/outer-space thriller film of all time.<br/><br/>Premise alone is not enough to make this movie work. 7 crew members on a giant mobile space station of sorts are kept from returning home when they receive an unidentified signal that they are required to answer and land on a strange planet where they pick up some killer cargo: an unknown alien species. The rest is a fight for survival on a spaceship. It's particularly bare, but Scott does something truly special with it by starting with the basics.<br/><br/>From the opening minutes of the film (all silent, like much of the film), Scott patiently shows you the terrific scenic design work and paints a haunting portrayal of space akin to ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" which Scott himself has credited as an influence. One of the biggest flaws of all films in space that have come since is that they fail to capture the essence of space and its strength as a thematic element. Scott's focus on the context of space really allows the desperate emotions of the characters to show and creates an empathy for the situation. These people are completely alone, they are facing a dangerous unknown and morality is not a force in outer space. You don't think about those things in most other sci-fi/horror films, plain and simple.<br/><br/>The characters are not as strong as the directing and set design, but Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is the first heroine/protagonist to emerge in the fray of a film. She is not established as the focal point until much later yet Weaver pulls you into her character quickly.<br/><br/>Scott also masters suspense in this film like any good horror film should. While the ""Alien"" franchise has since taken to all out battles and action sequences, Scott takes the budget restrictions and makes the film better because of it. Seeing lots of a giant man in a rubber alien suit or an animatronic alien robot is not going to keep your viewer's credibility. I still think Scott actually showed too much of the alien, but for the majority of the film, the alien's rare appearance makes the drawn out suspense really work. You're just waiting to catch a glimpse of this thing (a technique employed most recently in J.J Abrams ""Cloverfield"")<br/><br/>The cherry on top though is simply the thematic resonance. My expectation for a film like this to make me think at all is very, very low and ""Alien"" blows away that expectation. I expect to just be thrilled and scared a bit, not to weigh the pros and cons of being a species with a sense of morality. This film is terrific and I hope Scott will find his way back to science fiction before he calls it a career."

They remain simply men, and women, being hunted by a terrifying beast. Did I mention the look of the film?

","The film that can reduce grown men to tears, this movie scared the crap out of me the first time I saw it and still does. While its immediate sequel, James Cameron's ""Aliens"" (1986) is very good too, it's really more harrowing than frightening. Ridley Scott's original is just plain creepy as hell. It's rare to find a film more atmospheric than this one. Though I don't know what it's like to be on a space crew on board a big-ass ship in the middle of the universe, somehow I think it would be just like this. And it doesn't get more unsettling than the scene where the crew heads out to investigate a distress signal and come across the empty remains of a giant ship with a big batch of eggs growing on the floor. Need I say more? Despite the notorious reputation of John Hurt's dinner scene, the film isn't that gory. If there's anyone left on the planet who doesn't know what I'm talking about, I won't ruin it. But let's just say the next time you're at a dinner party and someone begins retching violently while his stomach starts bubbling, clear away the dishes and grab a blunt object. But other than that, the scares are primarily psychological. Filmed before the days when CGI could do everything for film makers, the visual effects team here knew if they showed too much of the alien, it would just look cheesy. Therefore, the audience never sees much more of it than brief glimpses, and our dread builds with the dread of the crew, because we don't know what we're dealing with anymore than they do. The same serendipity made ""Jaws"" a classic of suspense four years earlier.<br/><br/>And of course, the acting in this film is leaps and bounds above what you usually see in horror movies. Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm are great fun to watch as they match up in one battle of the will after another. John Hurt made a believer out of me. And Scott uses Tom Skerritt as effectively as Hitchcock did Janet Leigh in ""Psycho."" ""Alien"" really feels like a movie where absolutely anything could happen. I haven't really liked much of anything else Ridley Scott's done (and that includes ""Blade Runner""), but this movie at least proves he's got it in him to make a great film, even if he doesn't use that talent very often.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Very good but overrated science fiction film stars Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, a member of an intergalatic crew invaded by an alien, hence the title. What may have seemed in cool in 1979 now seems a bit dated and at times even boring. The film tries to take its time to build up tension, which is a good thing but unfortunately it also makes the beginning seem slow, and the padded running time doesn't help matters. Unlike STAR WARS, ALIEN does not quite stand the test of time. Still, the film stands out as one of the best of the 1970s. The movie was followed by four sequels: ALIENS which was far superior, ALIEN 3 which was awful, ALIEN: RESURRECTION which was just as bad as ALIEN 3 if not worse, and ALIEN VS.

","Things I remember best about Alien: Seeing it during its opening run in Times Square at 3:30 am, the only time I have attended a movie at that ungodly hour. (My best friend and my girlfriend talked me into it.) And I've gotta say -- it did keep me awake.<br/><br/>I liked the beat-up condition of the ship, and the Corporation being the villain, but beyond that I found the story predictable. The men of Nostromo couldn't've been more doomed if they'd had ""dead meat"" stenciled across their foreheads. I knew way ahead of time when each one was gonna get it -- I might even have been muttering, ""this one's a goner"" or supplying the screen characters with lines of my own like ""oh, why don't I go alone into this dark place -- it should be easy to kill me there!""<br/><br/>I'm not saying I didn't jump with the rest of the audience when each pathetic sucker got the coup de grace from the rapidly evolving Alien. But that's shock, not suspense. And it's a very old formula, one that I believe goes back to the silents, the old haunted house where characters get separated and picked off one by one. Not inventive. Not surprising. Not involving.<br/><br/>The stomach-buster was kind of cool. It grossed me out, and I certainly remember it. But the one moment I found completely captivating was when they rip the bad guy's head off ... and he keeps talking. Now, THAT was spooky. The android doesn't care about dying... because he's not actually alive. Without missing a beat, he keeps telling 'em they're all doomed. And just for a second I had a flash, a vision, of a whole other, more fascinating movie.<br/><br/>Then poof! it went away again. To sum up: while the monster design was effective and original, and Sigourney strong and sexy, much else fell flat. I'm proud to hold the minority opinion, that this film is overrated in the extreme. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars out of five.<br/><br/>Except for having five endings where one was needed, Cameron and Hurd's ALIENS is stronger than Scott's ALIEN in every way. [Maybe they were given the franchise just to humiliate him?] I felt completely involved with Ripley and the little girl. Lance Henriksen's GOOD android (to make up for the first story's BAD one?) was sympathetic, too. Maybe this isn't a fair comparison. As others posting here have pointed out, ALIENS is a whole other genre -- more action/adventure than horror suspense.<br/><br/>I'd Compare ALIEN instead to John Carpenter's remake of THE THING. I prefer THE THING. And the 40's black & white CAT PEOPLE. And the original NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. And CARRIE. And, of course, every horror movie David Cronenberg ever made, even the one he made right out of college that must've cost 75 cents (THEY CAME FROM WITHIN). His films always make your mind bend while your skin crawls.<br/><br/>Not having seen ALIEN in twenty-three years, maybe I oughtta rent it and give it another chance. Then again, I still haven't caught all these great new filmmakers from Iran..."

","Alien is a definitive experience. Just thinking back at the difficulties one had to face when approaching a genre which is nowadays filled with CGI, makes the feeling of admiration just surges within me. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that we get the same main element, the alien, the stories change. This first movie, as usually the most important of the whole series, is certainly a milestone for all horror and sci-fi films.<br/><br/>I would like to be able to tell the story from an objective point of view, but I consider it quite hard, as this type of movie, the horror type, is a disputed one. Each person can decide if it will or will not view such kind of movies. It is hardly probable that a person who does not like horror movies, will like this one. For one thing, horror movies will never win a major academy award, as they do not have what ALL people want to see. But if you want to be entertained, then this type of movie can get it on for you. Sci-Fi and Horror will always ring a scream in my head: Alien.<br/><br/>Spoilers<br/><br/>The story is simple at the beginning...sometime in the future, a cargo ship detects a signal from a planet, and it awakes the crew to check on what it might be. Until the chosen ones get to the planet we get a strange, but scary atmosphere. The planet itself is most obviously against the presence of human life, as the conditions are unfavorable(this will not be the same in Aliens though...does humanity win? Or does that planet really represent the end of human life? We don't get to know that, but when something looks wrong...it usually is wrong). The alien ship stands like a great colossus between the rocks of the horrid planet, and once inside, the unknown attacks. One crew member is infected by what is called a ""face hugger"". A creature with acid instead of blood, with a great defensive system which spawns the worst nightmare of Ellen Ripley.<br/><br/>There will be scenes which will make you jump and tremble, and the movie will keep you connected to the terrible events which happen on the Nostromo.<br/><br/>Alien exploits the fear of the unknown at its best, from the darkness of space to the alien within poor Kane, from the intimacy of being lost in space to the fear of mega-corporations, to claustrophobia, to solitude, to betrayal. It's all here, all encapsulated in one of the greatest films ever made. And such a world would not be complete without the beast itself.<br/><br/>All the things which relate to the evolution of the alien creature are brilliantly thought of. It has more phases of evolution, some phases in which it is truly vulnerable, yet it has the ability to survive, like any animal. Evolved instincts, great strength and a beastly intelligence...it could almost be something from our world. The fact that makes it different is the capacity to kill with ease humans - jolly! The most impressive thing about it is its looks: a fantastic design coming from the bizarre mind of Hans Rudi Giger, inspired - as a matter of fact - by his nightmares! <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is the actress which will always be the symbol of ""Alien"". I guess it took you some time to guess that one right, didn't it? Well, as always, the story of getting a classic role is filled with near-misses and false impressions. But life has its way of making things right, in such a manner that it always leaves you thinking: it couldn't have been any other way. When it actually could have. <br/><br/>Ridley Scott did a great job creating this universe with such a low budget, and he deserves most of the applause. He created one of the most terrific movies I have ever seen, with great horror scenes and great filming. His love for details made Alien what it is today - a huge mausoleum of horror, the wannabe result of any horror movie maker. Sinful in several ways by todays standards - slowly paced and lacking in terms of heavy action - Ridely Scott's film wins by defying them. A master at work can always be recognized."

","Alien was an absolutely brilliantly filmed movie.  Ridley Scott really knew how to create an atmosphere suitable for this movie. The Nostromo was totally desolate, with long hallways and empty rooms.  The music and sound is very quiet, which is perfect for creating suspense and horror.  What really stands out from this movie however, is the Alien itself.  The biology of the Alien is absolutely intriguing; a lifeform perfectly suited for destroying other lifeforms.  A genre defining movie that is one of hollywood's best.  10/10"

","The Aliens series is the only movie that comes to mind when I think of movies that truly scared/disgusted me.

","One of my favourite movies.<br/><br/>What enthrals me every time I see it, is the intelligence behind the whole thing, the way the people and spaceships look and operate is believable (eg a tug towing a huge mineral refinery through space - obviously if the journey takes months, it makes sense to not just transport the minerals, but refine them while you do it - little points like that make this a jewel of a film).<br/><br/>Of course the main thing is the Alien, which is again handled most intelligently, instead of the normal Hollywood approach of spending all the budget on special monster effects to the detriment of the story and thus having to justify that expense by showing you the monster in as many different, ultimately boring ways as possible, its left mostly to our imaginations (far more powerful than any effect) with only a few glimpses to keep the tension going.  The incubation idea borrowed from the desert wasp and the lifecycle of the Alien is intriguing, its not just another monster ""created"" by radiation or some superficial reason, somebody put some thought into it, I appreciate that.<br/><br/>The temptation for large explosions and massive weaponry is resisted most admirably. Instead the story, acting, attention to detail and management of tension and mood by Ripely Scott still make me cower behind a pillow after seeing this movie many times."
"Howlin Wolf","9","1","2","8 March 2001"," A lesson in suspense...
","With ""Alien"", Ridley Scott delivered one of the most inventive and atmospheric chillers of modern cinema.<br/><br/>   What makes it a classic?  A good script always helps, and this is a cast that refreshingly consists of 'actors' rather than big name stars who can't turn in a performance.  The fact that the principal crew is relatively small also helps because you feel a real sense of loss when one of them is offed. It makes a nice change from horror/monster movies where the hunter has a seemingly indefinite supply of prey to terrorise.<br/><br/>   The sets really are pretty cool for a movie made so long ago, and the director exploits the dramatic potential that such a setting provides. There are plenty of shadowy nooks and crannies for the alien to conceal itself in. and Scott knows how to build up the tension gradually, resisting the temptation to rush any encounters with the creature and thus spoil the unsettling mood.<br/><br/>   (SPOILERS)<br/><br/>   The chest-bursting scene must be one of the most shocking and brilliantly conceived moments in film.  The fact that the alien disappears soon after we see it at this point gives us a chance to absorb what's just happened and to take in the horrified reaction of the crew.  Wonderful.<br/><br/>   As mentioned before, the cast are uniformly excellent, with particular standouts being Holm and Weaver.  In Ripley we have a character who just happens to be female and is not a woman because such a decision makes a difference to the actual story (gratuitous vest & knickers scene towards the end excluded)  Weaver is excellent, clearly relishing at the idea of a strong female part, and showing off her talents accordingly.  If it wasn't the money that tempted her back for a fourth time in ""Ressurection"", it was perhaps the mistaken belief that Ripley was still a strong character, instead of the gimmick the studio had by then made her.  I can easily tell people who my favourite actors are, but when the same is asked of actresses I struggle; NOT because there are no good ones out there, but because they are rarely given the roles to shine.  Show me a Hollywood actress with a consistently good (and high profile) body of work.  I'm tempted to cite Sigourney as my favourite actress on the strength of the first three Alien movies alone, but she's rarely had a role as good as Ripley since ""Aliens""<br/><br/>   I marginally prefer the all-action sequel to this, but it's a close call. This takes a fairly unoriginal idea and exploits every last drop of tension from it until the climax.  The movie will leave you sweating.  Great stuff."
"ejlaplan","9","1","2","3 November 2000"," Top 3 best space-based science fiction films
","Alien, along with 2001 and Star Wars, are the three best science fiction films based in space. All other films of this type contain elements from at least one of these films, usually more than one. Alien's biggest contribution is it's atmosphere. The sets and camera choices give a specific and intense feeling watching it. This is a combination of Ridley Scott's and H.R. Giger's influence. The best shot in the film is the close up of Ripley all sweaty and dirty emerging from the ladder. Beads of sweat lace her fingers and then the focus goes to her face, scared as can be. Great."
"NEFARlOUS","10","1","2","3 December 1998"," The first, the best!
","Quite possibly the best science fiction movie of all time, certainly a benchmark for the Genre and a film that still manages to stand the test of time. From the opening (Quite literally!) sequence to the last scene, the ambiance of the film and the changing moods are captured perfectly. Even the old style displays and panels don't detract from the film, they add to it - this is an ore freighter, not a top of the line battlecruiser!<br/><br/>Where this film scores most highly is in the characterisations of the crew - the dialog flows so naturally it seems almost as if they are ad-libbing rather than reciting. Yaphet Kotto is particularly good at this, together with Harry dean Stanton - a kinda deep space Abbott 'n Costello. Tom Skerrit, Ian Holm and Veronica Cartwright (Who, incidentally was passed over for the role of Ripley) are also excellent. Sigourney Weaver's performance varies slightly, this was after all, her first major role, (Even if a certain amount of Nepotism was involved) but occasionally we get glimpses of a very competent actress.<br/><br/>This, togeather with the latest film, stay closest to the Geiger-esque visions of flesh/metal combinations which provoke such eerie reactions from the viewer. The chest bursting scene still retains its impact, even if the chest-burster does not (Sooty!)- interesting bit of trivia. Veronica's reaction was unfeigned - she was not told what was going to happen.....<br/><br/>The Director employs a technique that many of today's Horror maestro's should learn from. He utilises the Audience's imagination extensively. When Lambert is killed, you see the tail moving then the scene cuts to Ripley hearing....that. You see nothing, but you KNOW what is happening and that has more impact than any special effect could have.<br/><br/>A lot of the film takes place in a dark, grimy, used atmosphere that you see copied subsequently in such films as Bladerunner and the original Terminator.<br/><br/>All in all one of the very few films that I would unreservedly give 10/10 to, and watch again and again.<br/><br/>

"Bungle-9","9","1","2","5 July 2000"," One of Ridley Scott's greatest achievements
","I liked many things about this film that make it unique from the others, and contribute to the tension in the atmosphere. Firstly, the miniscule cast. It consisted of nine people, including the alien and the cat (not really a person), whom we really get to know and relate to. The characters are well developed, the acting fine. Next, the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere. Everything that goes on is in the same ship, making for (almost) no escape, hence the claustrophobic effect. When some of the crew check out the alien ship, the atmosphere is very tense as we don't know what will happen next. Next, the way it didn't feel staged in any way. It felt REAL, which was the whole point. The conversations weren't just one person talking at a time, rather several at once. This contributes to the realistic ambience making it generally more terrifying. <br/><br/>It has to be said, the alien has to be one of the most intimidating ever designed, with it's double mouth etc. I'd be scared out of my wits if I came into contact with something such as that! The excellent camerawork was a brilliant contribution to the chaotic feeling surrounding the events, it that it was very rough and raw, making us feel like we're there and that this is no simple studio production (it almost feels documentary-esque). One final thing would be to mention Jerry Goldsmith's amazing score for the film. It was a completely new genre of score, unorthodox in every sense, dark, haunting, chilling, you think of it it draws it out from you. Definitely not an action score. The imagination in this film is overwhelming, for example, the android, the alien (obviously), the conspiracy (is that a spoiler?), the ship, the hypersleep, EVERYTHING!!. That's what makes this film so great. It is the pioneer of its genre, and as such is is unparalleled by anything else. As a butter advert on the TV once said: ""Often copied, but never equalled"""
"Markymark","9","1","2","24 June 2000"," Praise of a masterpiece
","This has to rank as one of the most groundbreaking movies of all time. Even after 21 years of release it is still as scary as ever.  If this was to be released today it wouldn't look that out of place, as the sfx have been so cleverly done, only the computer's make it look old fashioned.  The most amazing thing about the whole film is it's ability to play on man's fear of the dark & of smothering/suffocation to make you not hate the alien but only to fear it greatly.  This was the first film to make me look under the bed repeatedly before putting the light out at night.  The only other film to really do that was John Carpenter's The Thing, which made you look at every living creature suspiciously for a while after seeing it.  Alien revitalised a stagnant movie genre by shaking off the B pic image normally given to space monster movies & in doing so set an awesome benchmark for other's to follow, few have done it anywhere near as well. All the sequels have been different in their own special way but none truly captures the tenseness & claustrophobic quality of this terror masterpiece.  This is a must have film for any collection."
"Semih","9","1","2","6 June 2000"," They shouldn't have messed with Jerry Goldsmith's score.
","In case you already didn't know, director Ridley Scott has made two movies where Jerry Goldsmith's score was disrepspectfully cut up (as in Alien) or completely thrown away (as in Legend). At any rate, Alien still is a classic. We have a female hero, we have H.R.Giger's imagination, and we have one mean alien. The filmmakers wanted to show an image of ""truckers in space"", hence the blue collar looking workers and chains, and an ""inside a factory"" like appearance. All this plus the cinematography and direction gives this film a very grotesque realism and clastrophobia. But only if they had kept Jerry Goldsmith's score as it originally was composed. When will they ever learn?"

","""Alien"" is by far one of my favorite science fiction series (And yes, I did like the third and forth installments even though I didn't feel they were as polished as the first two.)  The true test of a good movie is comparing how effective it was when it was first released to how it holds up today.  This is still a scary and claustrophobic mood-inducing film.<br/><br/>The scenes that I feel best represent the frantic pace of this film are the introduction of the chestburster, the first real look at the alien, Ash's ""secret"" revealed, and Ripley's escape from the Nostromo.  The movie is full of tense moments meant to make the viewer jump, whether it's the sense of impending doom for the hunted crew members, or some false lead used to make the viewer cringe before the alien attacks.  The fact that it's set inside a spaceship with simple designs and sterile white colors makes it all the more unnerving.<br/><br/>What's to say about this film that hasn't already been said?  ""Alien"" hasn't lost any of it's fear appeal, and the alien design has always been excellent (Thank you, Giger).  It's a wonderful combination of horror and science fiction with an effective cast and a brilliant use of natural sounds throughout the ship.  I love a good musical score as much as the next film fan, but the raw silence of the ship only adds to the tension.  A great movie, and quite the change from the idealistic ""Star Wars"" released only two years earlier."
"forebore-2","9","1","2","3 March 2000"," The best sci-fi/horror ... ever!
","With its many grisly special effects and truly suspenseful moments, Alien is sci-fi/horror at its best. The film is about the crew of a space freighter that, while returning to Earth, receives orders to land on an unexplored planet and investigate a derelict spaceship. While investigating the ship, one of the crew members is infected with a deadly creature that proceeds to burst out of his body and kill off the other crew members one by one. This film is very original and imaginative. It also borrows much from classic 50s science fiction, especially The Thing. It's a very entertaining movie with a good story, even better directing, and one of the most horribly realistic special effects in film history. My favorite scene is when Tom Skerritt shines his flashlight into a darkened corridor only to find the creature inches away from his face. That is the only scene in my history of movie-watching that was both scary and unpredictable enough to make me leap out of my seat and scream. Alien is a truly engaging (and terrifying) edge-of-your-seat thriller that never once lets you stop to take a breath."

","Before I continue this review, I just want to give a warning to everyone with photosensitive epilepsy. The entire third act of this movie is filtered by strobe lights. If you're sensitive to that kind of thing, then don't watch.<br/><br/>Plot and ""Characters"" - I honestly don't mind slow movies, but this is taking it too far. I'm not asking for nonstop action, all I really wanted was some kind of a plot, tension, maybe some world building, and possibly some character development. Just the bare bones that you'd want out of a movie. Unfortunately, this mess contains none of that. The ""plot"" can be summed up in one sentence - ""dumb people find alien, do dumb things then die."" One of the people on the ship turns out to be a robot and it doesn't even have anything to do with anything, it just happens. I've heard people say that these characters are incredibly well-developed, but they aren't. Calling them ""characters"" is an insult to the very word. There is next to nothing that differentiates them from one another. Instead of dull scenes without dialogue or anyone doing anything, this movie really could've used some scenes where the characters interact, express individual motivations, and maybe get some backstory. The start has a vague plot about getting away from the aliens, but but the time one person is left alive, the editor gave up and nothing makes sense. Even the movie knows its being boring too because Ripley strips for no reason and from then on the movie is filmed in a bit of a sexual manner.<br/><br/>Sights and Sounds - The visual quality and the effects and the sound design in this movie are all fine. Nothing great, but not bad. Its actually pretty good, considering its age.<br/><br/>This movie isn't scary or interesting. Really it commits the biggest crime that a movie can commit - its boring. It does almost nothing that a movie is supposed to do. Even my dad, who was blinded by nostalgia goggles prior to rewatching, realized how bad it is after watching it with me. Anyone who says that this movie is great clearly needs to rewatch it. I don't care that this movie doesn't have nonstop action - there are a lot of movies with lots of action that are boring. Honestly, I have no idea why people hold this trash in such high regard.

"BA_Harrison","10","2","8","6 May 2007"," Ridley Scott's superb space scare-fest.
","Just two years after mega-blockbuster Star Wars made sci-fi popular once again with cinema-goers, Ridley Scott presented us with an altogether different kind of space movie—a bloody scary one! Alien follows the luckless crew of the space-tug Nostromo, who are re-routed by their ship's computer when it picks up what seems to be a distress signal. Following the suspected S.O.S. transmission to a desolate planet, they set out to investigate the wreck of an alien craft unaware of the horror that awaits them.<br/><br/>Whilst Alien is essentially just a 'monster on the loose' movie (albeit with a big-budget) what makes it such an effective film is the loving attention to detail in all aspects of its production: the script (by Dan O'Bannon) presents us with a set of well developed characters who react believably to their unusual situation; the set design makes the claustrophobic Nostromo a totally realistic working environment for a crew on a long space haul; and the alien (based on concepts by H. R. Geiger) is a convincingly nasty critter which rapidly grows from a toothy chest-bursting snake-thing into a 7ft bio-mechanical monstrosity.<br/><br/>Scott takes his time developing the story before getting down to the really good stuff, his slow-burn approach allowing the viewer to familiarise themselves with the characters and drink-in the stunning visuals. But when things do start to go pear shaped for the crew of the Nostromo, he cranks up the tension to breaking point, delivering non-stop suspense and shocks right up to the closing credits.<br/><br/>The film also benefits from a very talented cast: the brilliant John Hurt is Kane, the poor schmuck who becomes a human incubator for the monster after poking his nose too far into an alien egg chamber; a young Sigourney Weaver plays Ripley, the tough heroine of the movie; Ian 'Bilbo Baggins' Holm is the nasty science officer Ash; and Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Kotto play alien fodder.<br/><br/>Occasionally Scott relies a little heavily on mechanical scares (Jones the cat is responsible for a few too many false alarms) and some elements require a little more explaining for very picky folk like me (such as 'how the hell did a face-hugger manage to latch on to the big 'space jockey' alien seen in the wreck?'), but seeing as we get to see Sigourney Weaver in the universe's teeniest pair of pants, I'm willing to overlook these trifles and award Alien a whopping 10/10."

","There may be debates over whether movies should portray aliens positively or negatively, but ""Alien"" shows that all bets are off. This is possibly THE perfect sci-fi/horror flick; in fact, it doesn't even suffice to call it such. From the moment when the egg attacks Kane (John Hurt) to Ellen Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) battles against the title character, this movie has you tensed up every second of the way. You may be very suspicious of every movement around you after watching this movie.<br/><br/>Obviously, what made ""Alien"" so great was that it had a woman going all bad-ass on a big ugly creature from another world. You probably know about the ""chest"" scene (or maybe you've seen a spoof of it), but you have to see it to believe it! All in all, this is a great movie. Weaver turns in a top-notch performance, and great support from Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm, Veronica Cartwright and Tom Skerritt, add to the movie's high quality. ""Aliens"" was also pretty good, ""Alien 3"" was tolerable, and ""Alien: Resurrection"" was...well, that's debatable.

","Perhaps everything that could be said on IMDB about Alien has already been written. <br/><br/>Today's Millennial techies have seen Alien on TV many times and have no doubt been desensitized to the film. It is a pity that those watching Alien today cannot see it through eyes of a person who saw it for the first time in 1979. <br/><br/>In 1979 there was nothing to prepare a movie goer for what they were about to see. Nothing was like it before and films like it after are, to some extent, an homage.<br/><br/> Star Trek and Star Wars projected a futuristic view of a Utopian world so far advanced and different from present day life and science. The Star Wars spacecrafts had clean futuristic lines and the costuming and gadgets were wonderous<br/><br/>A Horror movie in space was essentially new territory. 'The Thing' was perhaps most similar to Alien and has been said to inspire the story. The isolation and foreboding of the Arctic was similar to the emptiness but at the same time claustrophobia of space travel.<br/><br/>Except for the suspended animation chambers in the beginning of Alien, this future is unremarkable and not very awe inspiring
The ship is a hulking unimpressive bilgy utilitarian vessel not unlike a present-day cargo ship. 
The crew is not a well-honed team but a scowling, complaining bunch putting in a day's work. Their dress and appearance convey how unremarkable and undisciplined they are, as is their attitude. 
There is no endearing android like R2D2 or CP30 here either. These clearly are not the buck Rodgers, Han Solo heroes that we had come to expect from our spacemen and women prior to Alien. 
They are not much different from us which, perhaps, makes Alien even more frightening.<br/><br/>In 1979 there was no CGI remotely like what we have to day. The dark steamy hell of the planet and the Alien were created with 1970s techniques and yes, meat parts. The music by Jerry Goldsmith is perfection in building nerve grating tension. The sound affects is the little mentioned costar of this movie. The jarring and ominous computer sounds set the uneasy mood. The subtle organic sounds of the movements of the Alien made it that much more frightening.<br/><br/>Unlike today's incredible CGI video games, crude Apple II and Atari video games like space invader and Asteroids could never have prepared us to what we were about to see in this movie. The original Alien trailer was perhaps one the most effective trailers ever produced.
It gripped TV viewers to the extent that it created anticipation and tension even before going to the theater.<br/><br/>I often wondered how Alien would differ if it were filmed in Black and White. It is primarily filmed in disturbing muted color; essentially Film Noir. I have intentionally viewed it in B&W only and believe me, it adds a whole new dimension.<br/><br/>I can remember when Alien was first reviewed. One reporter interviewed people who had walked out of the movie because they were so disturbed by it. The tension was too unbearable to them.<br/><br/>I wish that new viewers could see Alien the way we in 1979 did... never experiencing anything like it before... and not desensitized and maybe jaded by the following 37 years and 21st century digital wizardry.
The Next Time Alien is on TV, turn on your sound system and transport yourself to a theater in 1979 surrounded by nervous movie goers already squirming as they view the famous slowly appearing fragmented title sequence. 
People already started to squeal during the opening scene and sound effects of the ship awakening even before a character was seen or a word of dialog was said! <br/><br/>Try to block out the following 40 years of Hollywood high tech and yes try turning off the color for a different film Noir experience."

"bromegaman","10","1","3","16 January 2018"," Alien (1979) - Director's Cut: An incredible feat of horror filmmaking, with technical achievements and storytelling principles that set a strong precedent for films to come.
","Dan O'Bannon, Ronald Shusett, and Ridley Scott's 'Alien' hails from a time of creative innovation in horror films. From 'Carrie' and 'Halloween' before it in 1976 and 1978 respectively, to 'The Shining' in 1980, 'The Thing' in 1982, and even 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' in 1984, horror as a genre experienced a sort of renaissance. Sure, there were still plenty of unimaginative slasher flicks on the market, but the above films including 'Alien' changed popular perception of what made a truly good horror film.<br/><br/>The difficulty in discussing components of 'Alien' is that they meld together so well. Discussing the characters initially tends to end, at least for me, with a discussion on the direction and the pacing of the film. The technicals and the story just blend together nearly seamlessly; however, I'll still try.<br/><br/>THE STORY
From a basic storytelling perspective, 'Alien' is quite simple. A mining crew of the spaceship Nostromo are woken up early from cryosleep to investigate a mysterious radio signal of potentially alien origins on an unexplored planetoid. There, they discover an alien race, a member of which manages to be born on board and kills them one by one. Also in contention is the duplicity of one of their crew members in regards to this seemingly unstoppable alien creature's value. Fairly simple stuff, and it follows a typical horror film formula. It manages to hide some depth, however.<br/><br/>One of the premises the film explores is the role of an individual worker in a corporate environment that is so large it is literally in deep space. Obviously, this doesn't get in the way of the central proceedings, because a deliberate social satire would seriously clutter the sharp pacing of the film itself. The idea, however, manifests itself in subtler ways: Brett and Parker's pay dispute over shares, Ash's duplicity, as he is ordered by the company to retrieve the alien lifeform for corporate purposes, at the expense of the rest of the crew. The pay dispute subplot is one small piece, and really only adds development to the characters, but Ash's duplicity creates real horror and tension, as well as challenges the audience to ponder a more deep question. Horror films don't often challenge the viewer in this way, nor do they do so while still crafting an effective film in general.<br/><br/>Though it follows a fairly straight-forward structure, the film has very well-written characters acted beautifully by every cast member. The dialogue is sharp yet realistic, and the Nostromo crew rank as some of the best horror ensembles in the history of the genre, in cinema at least. As a result, their deaths aren't morbidly gratifying like in many horror films, but terrifying, and it almost seems as if the film is toying with the viewers like the Alien is toying with the crew themselves. Every death is impactful, uniquely scary, and yet internally plausible.<br/><br/>The ending is fairly optimistic (though a tad bittersweet), and though a downer ending may have been more thematically impactful, the viewer would have just been gripped by nearly two hours of relentless horror and tension. Seeing these characters endure so much, it's truly satisfying to see Ripley come out on top. All in all, a finely tuned story.<br/><br/>THE TECHNICALS
'Alien' boasts some absolutely amazing technical achievements. When I think of the film, I think of a katana; both are comparatively sharp. The pacing and editing of this film is damn near perfect. Every scene serves a purpose, not only in developing characters, but in building tensions, and in many cases, surprising the viewer. Many scenes achieve many things at once. The revelation of Ash's duplicity, to again return to this point, achieves all three. The exploration of the crashed alien spaceship also does all three. If the editing had been wonky, the story would have crumbled. Thankfully, David Crowther, Terry Rawlings, and Peter Weatherley do a spectacular job on that front.<br/><br/>As well, I would be remiss if I didn't talk about H.R. Giger's designs. The ingenious thing about these designs is that they play directly on the viewer's mental states. The film, in concept, is quite conventional, but Giger's horrific and yet fascinating designs are alien enough to create wonder in the viewer, but horrifyingly familar enough (in the anatomical sense) that it's repulsive and frightening. The creature designs and the atmosphere created by that are also essential to the film's execution.<br/><br/>Lighting, sound, and visual production are top-notch as well, for the most part. Some beautiful lighting at the beginning allows the viewer to take in the Nostromo in wonderment; the restrained lighting at the end allows the viewer to be in desperation with Ripley. It's not just her escaping. The production design is, of course, iconic. The 1970s retrofuture design is sleek and eye-catching, and really sells the setting. It's so good that 'Alien: Isolation' years later would continue with the design choice. The sound is also mostly quite good, with a very atmospheric soundtrack and great sound effects. Only in Ripley's meeting with Brett and Parker down in the lower decks did I notice some mistakes in sound mixing, and I personally don't really care for the ending score. Other than that, sound production is also top-notch.<br/><br/>Lastly, Ridley Scott's direction and Derek Vanlint's cinematography is quite notable as well. Many horror films tend towards short, punchy shot lengths and frenetic, underexposed cinematography. 'Alien' does just the opposite: its shots are long and deliberate, and show just enough to indicate to the viewer exactly what is intended. There is no visual manipulation here, and though there are many things that happen off-screen, 'Alien' does not shy away from using its visual design to burn the implied image directly into the viewers' minds. It is daring, scary stuff that horror films could stand to do more of today.<br/><br/>All of the film's characteristics mesh together beautifully to create one of the most effective horror films ever made. 'Alien' is at once horrifying, tense, profound, enchanting, and beautiful. No wonder it spawned a franchise. Sadly, no subsequent film ever tried to take the concept and continue on with it. As well, few horror films today seem to operate from the 'Alien' school of horror filmmaking. Thus, 'Alien' stands in a league nearly of its own, but with what it boasts, it does just fine on its own.<br/><br/>NOTE: I've never seen the original theatrical cut, so I'm not aware of what specific changes were made. Keep in mind this review is based on the 2004 re-release, and is about a minute short from what I understand."

","I was lucky enough to get the Alien box set on bluray for christmas this year, so I thought this might be a good chance to start posting my reviews of them. There wasn't much on tv last night apart from xmas movies so I thought to hell with this, i'm watching Alien. =P<br/><br/>So the plot to begin with isn't overly complicated. The crew on a deep space mining barge called the Nostromo is woken out of cryo sleep by the ships computer (Mother). They find out that Mother has surprisingly intercepted a transmitter beacon of unknown origins and it's primary company (Weyland-Yutani) is sending the crew in to investigate. Once they realize that it isn't exactly what they were expecting and things going horribly wrong (I won't spoil it for people who haven't yet seen it) from that point onwards it's a classic fight for survival and a terrifying battle against the unknown.<br/><br/>The opening scenes around the breakfast table does a good job of introducing us to the seven members of the crew, including a young and VERY gorgeous looking Sigourney Weaver. We see the conflict between Dallas, the ships captain, and the other crew members debating whether they actually need to investigate this signal, the influence of money is what determines their motivation to do it as failure to adhere to company policy will result in a zero paycheck.<br/><br/>The thing Alien is best at is building tension. right from the opening titles with the soft, eerie music score we can tell straight away what kind of movie it's going to be. The dark and mechanical atmosphere of the Nostromo sets the backbone of this movie perfectly and it's dark, metallic, maze like corridors and junctions works so well to create such a spooky and claustrophobic environment, and the workhorse, pig headed, hostile attitude of the crew helps set the scene for the film. The slow and methodical buildup is what makes this film so powerful and even after the s*it hits the fan, the tension doesn't stop there. The latter parts of the film where they split up into groups to search for the Alien, the scene where Brett is trying to catch Jonesie (the ships cat), and the scene where Dallas is crawling around in the vent shafts with his only source of light being his makeshift flamethrower, it's almost 40 years on, but god damn the tension is still very much alive to this day and STILL has you feeling that raw fear.<br/><br/>Even the theme of the word Alien itself makes an impact. It's the theme of dealing with a foreign species, the theme of dealing with the unknown, the themes of space and fear and isolation and claustrophobia. all of these themes combine together to create an extremely fearful and powerful horror experience. If you haven't seen Alien yet, What in gods name is wrong with you? JUST SEE IT ALREADY!"

","This film begins aboard a commercial space craft named ""The Nostromo"" which is manned by a crew of seven and serves as a refinery for 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore. As the story unfolds, the spaceship was initially headed back to Earth while the crew were put into suspended animation. When they awaken they discover that they have been rerouted to another part of space in order to check out a strange message from what could be of alien origin. Although they had hoped to return to Earth on schedule, due to company policy they are required to investigate so they begrudgingly follow orders and land on a small planet while sustaining some damage to the space craft in the process. However, since the source of the transmission is nearby they decide to check it out and find an alien spaceship which contains the dead body of a strange creature with a gaping hold inside of it which appears to have imploded from within. They also discover several leathery eggs on board as well--and this is where the trouble starts. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was one of the scariest movies-and certainly the scariest science-fiction film-I have ever seen. It had a good plot, excellent suspense and a solid cast which included Tom Skerritt (as ""Dallas""), Sigourney Weaver (""Ripley""), Yaphet Kotto (""Parker"") and Harry Dean Stanton (""Brett"") among others. That said, those who enjoy a little science-fiction with their horror (or possibly vice-versa) might like this particular film and I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average."

","""Alien"" is one of the greatest horror movies of all time, for good reasons. It was one of the first movies of its kind, and it introduced the xenomorph to audiences everywhere.

Ellen Ripley is also a great protagonist. She is a strong, intelligent woman and one of the best female heroes of film history.<br/><br/>This is a great movie to watch, and I highly recommend it."
"jodyshop","10","1","3","3 November 2017"," I consider it the atmosphere and the way you actually must feel!
","In ""Alien"" we follow a seven man crew en-route to earth on board the huge space freighter ""Nostrum"". The crew is in cryosurgery, but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. There they make contact with an alien life- form...<br/><br/>What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew is not particularly friendly towards each other, and you truly feel all the in-group tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out industrial-style maze of halls and corridors, and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless, soul-less parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the monster is a stroke of genius.<br/><br/>Sure it has a humanoid form, but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence.<br/><br/>The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized, plus the creature is more well-adapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it.<br/><br/>To sum up, you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of in-group tensions, an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship."

"classicalsteve","10","1","3","1 November 2017"," Maybe the Best SF Film of All Time: Partially Inspired by ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space""
","Most of the intellectual film community cites ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as the greatest science fiction film of all time. Film critics take notice: I think the original ""Alien"" surpasses ""2001"" as the best science fiction film to date. That's not to say there aren't other films worthy of golden rocket ship trophies aside from ""Alien"" and ""2001"", such as the original 1977 ""Star Wars"" (aka ""Star Wars IV: A New Hope""), ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", and ""Blade Runner"". Probably the first aspect which pushes ""Alien"" passed many other films, is how it slowly brings us into a ""universe"" without being self-conscious about it, somewhat similar to the first space sequence of ""2001"". To be fair, ""2001"" did pave the way for films like ""Alien"" and ""Star Wars"". The scope of the story, again somewhat similar to ""2001"" is very confined: a space ship which has a brief encounter on a planet and what is brought on-board.<br/><br/>First we encounter a cargo vessel, the Nostromo, bound for Earth carrying millions of tons of iron ore. The vessel seems to be moving slowly through space. We then are shown the inner corridors of the ship. The corridors are all is silent, which is very different than the opening to the original Star Wars in which a small ship is being pursued by an imperial star-ship larger than a supernova. Here, we see the ship's empty corridors and for a moment wonder if anyone is actually on-board. We even see a room with a large computer. Suddenly, the computer and ship ""come to life"", lights flashing. But no passenger appears responsible for this end to the long silence.<br/><br/>Then we see seven sleeping passengers whose glass lids are opened. We deduce that one of the ways space travel is accomplished in this ""universe"" is to put the passengers to sleep, which probably solves the problem of life support and food. Passengers are put into extended hibernation for long periods during travel and are awakened at arrival. Now the hibernation compartments have been opened. The first passenger to awake looking groggy and spent is Kane (John Hurt) who moves slowly out of his sleeping bay. The other passengers follow.<br/><br/>Finally, the passengers finally awakened, they learn they are not home yet. Why were the passengers awakened before completing the voyage? Dallas the captain (Tom Skerritt) has consulted with the super-computer which runs the ship, affectionately nicknamed ""Mother"" who has awakened them because it received a signal from another planet. We learn it was programmed to awaken the passengers if certain situations arise and in this case, the signal was one of those scenarios. They are also compelled in their contract to investigate such a signal, or their shares, the money promised them, will be revoked.<br/><br/>Several of the crew board a shuttle craft and land on the planet where they find an ancient ship. The ship was designed for beings many times the size of the human crew. The corridors of this ship are much more ominous than that of the cargo ship, almost like a giant abandoned city. A fossilized corpse of a large creature many times bigger than an average human being seems fused to a large chair. Kane finds a strange holding area where large oval-shaped objects, about the half the height of a person, are spread about. Kane examines one of them which seems to come alive and attack him. The landing party returns but Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) declines to let Kane in until he's gone through 24 hours of decontamination. The science officer Ash (Ian Holm) lets them inside, contradicting Ripley's orders.<br/><br/>A strange parasitic organism is attached to Kane's face, and it has ultra defenses to prevent it from being removed from Kane. When Dallas and Ash try to remove it, its tale wraps tightly around its host. When they try to cut into it, it spews acid. This turns out to be the first part of a three-part encounter with something alien, interpreted both as a noun and an adjective. Aside from the action sequences, the reasons for the original signal, the awakening of the crew, the investigation and the presence of the thing itself all have political implications.<br/><br/>""Alien"" is not just a classic science fiction story but a masterpiece of genre filmmaking. The pace and tone of the film are gradual but deliberate. At nearly every moment, the crew, who are simply a bunch of working class stiffs, never fully understand what they're dealing with. When finally the entire scope of their situation is revealed, it's almost too late."
"justinpkelly","9","1","3","27 October 2017"," A Horror Masterpiece
","In space, no one will hear you creep downstairs to watch Alien on the night before Halloween. Alien is one of the true masterpieces of the horror genre, from a direction, acting, and writing standpoint. You'd be very hard-pressed to find a ""best horror movies"" list that doesn't include this movie. Although there are quite a few other movies in the franchise, none of them match the quality of Alien (Not even James Cameron's fantastic Aliens). Pretty much everything about this movie is iconic now; the poster alone has become permanently burned into the memories of people who have never even seen the movie. The film's many strengths stem from Ridley Scott's impeccable direction. Although people have criticized Scott in recent years for his latest movies, not a single person can deny that his direction is absolutely gorgeous. For example, the scene in which the characters explore the crashed Alien ship looks beautiful due to way Scott portrays its gigantic scale. The set design also adds to the tense atmospheres of the movie. The inside of the USCSS Nostromo, the ship that is the main setting of the film, is incredibly creepy and feels extremely realistic. And the main monster of the movie, the Xenomorph, has one of the coolest creature designs ever put to film. Although many movies are able to effectively create tension without showing the creature, the Xenomorph looks so scary that it works even when it is shown. The performances are also completely perfect and truly sell the claustrophobic terror of the movie. My favorite scene in the entire movie is the famous chest-bursting scene; the idea of a creature that grows in your stomach and ruptures it when leaving is so unnerving. After watching the movie, any stomaches that you may have will likely cause you a bit of anxiety. I also think that the twist involving Ash gives the movie an added layer of complexity and keeps it from being a movie that solely relies on a monster eating people. If you haven't seen Alien, I highly suggest watching it this Halloween season. It truly is one of the all-time greats and there is a pretty slim chance that any horror movie set in space ever tops it."

","I remember where I was in 1979 when this movie came out, I was a young professional with 5 little kids from 3 to 10 years old. We didn't have a lot of time for movies and we never got around to seeing this in the theater.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to 2010, a re-release of this movie plus the next three in one complete set on BluRay disk, along with two extra disks of extras. A total of 6 BDs. I found that my local public library has the set and today I watched this one. I will watch the other three over the next week or so. Being on BluRay the sound and picture are first-rate, worth seeking out for fans of these movies.<br/><br/>The movie has a fine cast of mostly well-established actors but I will only focus on one, Sigourney Weaver in her still iconic role as Ripley. Set somewhat in the future, as the movie begins we see that a merchant spaceship is traveling back towards Earth after a mining mission, the crew of seven are in hibernation pods. The pods open, the crew awakes, and we soon find out it is premature, but for a specific reason. A signal, possibly from intelligent life, is detected from a nearby moon and the ship is preprogrammed to wake them for a possible mission, to investigate for life forms and bring specimens back to Earth to study.<br/><br/>They go and in the exploratory mission in fact encounter an alien life form that attaches itself to the face of one of the crew, forcing them to bring the alien back to the ship to save the man. This ultimately creates a number of really serious issues and soon survival of the crew is at stake.<br/><br/>This of course is a very well told story and a very well made movie, indicative of its high IMDb rating.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: For my own recollection. The crew members, one by one, are killed by the alien as it grows in size and reasoning. Ripley finally realizes only she can escape and must blow up the mother ship and its cargo to destroy the alien. As she sets that in motion and retreats to the smaller escape ship, once there she finds the alien has stowed away there also. She puts on the space suit and releases a toxic gas that gets the alien in position that she can open a door and have it expelled. Then she puts herself into a state of hibernation. In the next movie, ""Aliens"", we find out that she was in that state for 57 years before being recovered."

","This is the one that will never be topped. CGI cannot compete with an actual physical presence and never will. We are all used to it now, but the first time I saw the Alien, it was difficult to look at, it was truly disturbing looking. I think I first saw this movie on VHS with my family when I was 10. I don't think any other movie gripped me; the end when Ripley is running through the corridors back and forth is classic. My heart was pounding I can remember it to this today. I was in that hallway with her. The orange lights flashing on my face. Everything about this movie is just classic. The fact that you never get to know what the Alien really looks like, because it keeps changing. So, it stayed frightening, most monster movies, you get one look at the creature and it might be scary, but soon you get used to it, this movie never allowed you the chance. First, its a pile of Bones (yes, bones), in a derelict spacecraft. Then its the egg and the face-hugger, then it changes to the chest- burster, and onto the Alien. It almost feels like 2 different movies; Act I is so different and is a really good Sci-Fi feel with the Nostromo and crew flying the ship and the lander. ACT II brings on the tension as soon as they land on LV426. I remember waiting for something to jump out at them, while walking to the ship, but in true Hitchcockian suspense nothing happened. The anticipation to the jump-scare of the face-hugger was tremendous. Add to that the parts of Dallas in the Tube and the side story about this greedy corporation, and the Ash, wow. What a movie, I don't think it will ever be topped, just as the first 5 seasons of 'Game of Thrones' will never be topped - like 'Star Wars' and 'Empire.' The times we live in are not conducive to creating similar works of art. CGI has taken over way too much for the detail to be spent on creating something from nothing. CGI creates laziness, look at the neomorph in Alien: Covenant, it looked totally fake to me, it did not look like it was in the same room with the lady. Sad we never got Prometheus II. They should have stopped after 'Aliens.' I totally agree with James Cameron. Although I liked Prometheus."

This was the only decent thing playing so I went in. Amazing experience unfolded. I like space movies, sci-fi and a good thriller so this had my full attention. This movie just unravels so nicely and at the same time pulls you into the story line. Mysterious signal, deep outer space and an investigation by an inexperienced but knowledgeable team. From there, glue keeps you in your seat and eyes on the screen. One nice scene after another with intrigue and suspense presents itself. I remember when I first saw the Alien and how the idea of something that does what it does so well and humans have no defense just mesmerizes the viewer. Just when I thought that it was predictable and winding down, it literally burst into a second act more terrifying than the first! I wont reveal anymore because I want you to have the tension that makes you grip your seat and remind yourself to breath. Nicely done to all involved. It is easy to see why this was such a success and remains a must see movie. Good movie for sunflower or pumpkin seeds to keep the hands and fingers busy or you may chew your nails to the nubs. Have a tasty drink standing by too. I have seen this so many times and will see it again too. Go now"
"mattsewellisqueer","9","1","3","8 September 2016"," One of the finest feminist films ever made
","Had to review this one. As Hollywood carts out one male fantasy after another about ""butt- kicking"" women and insisting these cartoonish appropriations of male violence are somehow progressive, it's good to go back to Ridley Scott's ALIEN and revisit what REAL feminist characters should look like.<br/><br/>As you may or may not know, I'm a feminist accidentally born with testicles, so my opinion in this matter is valid. Both women characters in ALIEN prove to be smarter and more resourceful than the men they are surrounded by. The film begins, as you should well know, with a landing crew investigating a large, phallic spaceship that has sent out a distress signal. Veronica Cartwright's character Lambert says, no less than twice, ""Let's get out of here."" Her feminine intuition has already told her the distress signal is a decoy. When they find the giant skeleton of a humanoid alien on the ship with its chest cage busted out, she says it again. Do the men listen? No. And they will pay a price for it.<br/><br/>Shortly after, the landing party brings an injured member back (Harry Dean Stanton's unfortunate character Brett) to their spaceship with an alien attached to his face. Sigourney Weaver's ACTUAL butt-kicking character, Ripley, refuses to let the infected crew member on the ship. Once again, a woman doing what is exactly right and, once again, the men don't listen to her. She, of course, will be rewarded once the alien has cut loose and wreaked havoc on the ship by being the only member to survive.<br/><br/>Do guns and flamethrowers and other phallic symbols of the oppressive patriarchy help her survive this ordeal? Ultimately, no. She disposes of the alien, in her final confrontation with it, using her wits.<br/><br/>Women are inherently repulsed by violence. That Ripley should eliminate the threat to her life using her intelligence as a weapon makes her, possibly, the greatest feminist character ever put on screen.<br/><br/>One last thing: I see a lot of people calling this movie ""slow."" Clearly, they are threatened by a strong, independent female protagonist, otherwise, they would not criticize this movie."

"sandnair87","9","1","3","22 April 2015"," Alien Rips You Out of Your Stupor!
","There's something eerie and absolutely unnerving about Ridley Scott's 'Alien' from the moment it begins.<br/><br/>For the first 45 minutes, very little happens. We float silently around a huge, empty spaceship, Ridley Scott masterfully conjuring the mood as his patient directorial gaze explores the mechanical womb of the commercial towing vessel Nostromo.. Even without its extra- terrestrial threat, Nostromo is an unsettling place - a gigantic haunted house drifting through the most unforgiving environment known to man. The aforementioned spaceship intercepts a distress call from a distant planet and wakes up its crew including Ripley (Sigourney Weaver giving a tough-as-nails portrayal in what is arguably the greatest female character committed to celluloid), which was in stasis en-route to Earth. The feel here is slightly groggy, as if the film, as well as the crew, still hasn't completely woken up yet. They land on the barren planet and discover a huge, derelict space craft where they stumble onto a strange life form in a repository of extraterrestrial eggs. Soon, a multiple legged monster launches on to one curious crew member, impregnating him with a vicious alien being. It comes back aboard slapped across his face and ends up grinding its way through his chest the next morning (in the now-iconic chest bursting sequence), as a horrible creature that rapidly evolves into a full-grown, acid- blooded killer that begins picking off the crew one by one. It soon transforms in to a battle for life for Ripley who evades the relentless force of nature that's infiltrated her ship at all costs and the movie that started off as a daydream quickly turns into a nightmare.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott spawns a truly creepy tale that introduces real heart palpitating fear into the sci-fi equation. Right from the start, he cues us in to what Alien will be: a distinctly deliberate exercise in terror. The level of suspense and fear that he ratchets up is excruciating, as cleverly devised plot points and character revelations keep the audience off balance right up to the final frame. He displays an eye for detail and a brilliant way of alternating false scares with genuine jolts, which help to create a seamless blend of Gothic horror and harrowing science fiction. He also manages to keep the alien enigmatic and swift, rather than just a lumbering beast hogging the screen.<br/><br/>Alien continues to resonate as a brilliant sci-fi/horror hybrid that seems like a simplistic monster in the house picture but reveals layers underneath its somewhat simplistic premise, going well beyond the usual genre trappings. This is a must-have cinematic experience that will leave you shivering and adrenalized."
"georgegathern","10","1","3","6 April 2015"," Best film of all time!
","This is how a film should be made! Very suspenseful sci-fi horror film. Much better than it's sequels and spin-offs and most of it's effects still holds up today because of how they were created, great build up of tension and great story. I especially like the way that unease is built up even before they discover that the alien is on board, the ill-ease between the crew and the isolation felt by the crew. Even the title sequence is helps to build the suspense as it shows you just how isolated the crew are.<br/><br/>If you are an action fan, however, it is probably better to skip this film and skip to aliens because the only action here comes at the end when Ripley tries to escape the exploding ship, and it is really just a chase scene.<br/><br/>10/10 - would have given it higher."
"Joenovak32","10","1","3","2 April 2015"," Excellent sci-fi horror
","This is a movie that is just perfect to me. Everything I love about science fiction and horror movies are here. The sets are wonderful and interesting, the lighting is creepy, and the cinematography is excellently done. I love horror movies that have interesting characters, unlike horror now with characters I don't care about. The acting is excellent. I bought the whole Alien quadrilogy pack on Blu-Ray and I was impressed how great it looks, I say if you go to Target or Walmart and find it then buy it. My favorite part of this movie is the claustrophobic environment, it isn't like the crew could walk outside the ship so they were trapped. The movie was great in just about every area, and I think this is Ridley Scott's masterpiece. I'm giving this a 10/10, this movie is perfect, I would recommend this to anyone who loves sci-fi or horror or just loves great movies in general."

","First one should appreciate the script work done by the writer because it was shot in 1979 and one cant expect so much of graphics and VFx used now a days.And it is done very brilliantly like how the blood and violence were used in those days is awesome. Also the chestbursting scenes were shot terribly in those days with only camera effects were used.Also the shape and size of the ship was awesome i guess cameras in those times were not enough to put that big ship.! I vote 9 because we were in 2015 so we feel somewhat awkward when seeing some scenes where people cant float,also they were eating some regular pasta stuff and see our recent films like Gravity(2013) and Intestellar(2014)."
"robsta23","8","1","3","25 March 2015"," Good Mix of Different Genres
","To say this movie is a good movie in relation to the ""body genre"" is an understatement. I got a very upset stomach when John Hurt's character had an alien bulging through his chest. I knew the iconic scene before viewing the movie, but actually watching the film made it affect me so much more. I also nearly had a headache towards the conclusion when there were strobe lights flashing in order to build the tension for the climax. This is strange and impressive because my body usually does not respond to films that much, even in the ""body genres.""<br/><br/>I watched this in a science-fiction film class, but we were discussing it and it is almost ambiguous as to whether this film more readily fits into the sci-fi or horror genre. The heavily black mise-en-scene would point to horror, but the ideas of aliens and robots easily puts this film into the sci-fi genre.<br/><br/>The pace of this film is very peculiar to me. On one hand, it is particularly slow towards the beginning of the film, which made it enjoyable as a faster-paced film once the conflict with the titular alien arises, but this fast pace almost skipped information in my opinion. What I noticed was that once the alien starts attacking the various crew members, the members would die, but then the film would quickly cut to the characters back at the safe part of the ship either discussing the death or holding something the character had on him/her right before they died. These quick cuts imply that the characters found the bodies and returned without trouble; wouldn't it make more sense to show them going to find the bodies to build even more suspense since the audience would question whether the alien moved on or not? Isn't it possible the alien would still be with the bodies?<br/><br/>After a lot of exposition, a face-hugger clamps itself onto the John Hurt character, and while Ripley wants to leave him in order to follow protocol, the audience wants to see them take care of the man; all of the audience except me, that is. I know the alien needs to get onto the ship in order for the film to have relevance as a horror film, but I found Ripley's reasoning to be past logical - it's the only reaction that makes sense, but I guess we want to see people sticking out for each other, so the alien gets on board. Thanks Ash, you company man cyborg.<br/><br/>Other than these complaints I have, this film does an excellent job at evoking bodily responses which makes for a fun, yet unsettling, experience. I can't wait to see what comes in store next when we watch Aliens next week."

And after 36 years of this movie, a lot of movies can't be made with these impressive visual effect.

","Alien is a classic, but that's not news. This movie was probably the first of its kind, meaning a bona fide horror that takes place in space. We'd seen slashers, monsters and specters, but a savage alien life form... never.<br/><br/>The sheer unfamiliarity of what they were up against, both for the audience and the characters, made Alien especially horrifying. Then to see it and its mouth full of dripping razor sharp teeth. Yikes! <br/><br/>Look, I was three years old when this movie came out and I probably saw it before I reached the age of ten; that alien was terrifying. Then the claustrophobic feeling of the ship only added to the suspense and danger. Watching that movie made me only think of one thing: don't let that thing reach Earth!!"

","1 word: Suspense This film uses suspense to absolute effect, even though there's only one alien (unlike aliens)it heightens the sense of anxiety further in the viewer, the fear of not knowing when the creature will pop up or what will happen to the unfortunate characters.<br/><br/>The support acting is sublime and perfectly supports the character of Ridley Scott, who played by Sigourney Weaver is a hard heroine figure commanding leadership over the crew members and Sigourney Weaver fits this character absolutely perfectly!

"msvalkyrie","9","1","3","28 February 2015"," In Space, No One Can Hear You.... Enjoying A Movie?
","It's a good film and I enjoyed it. It is jumpy in scenes but that's just the movie itself. Since the whole movie isn't all just made out of the alien, it's the spooky atmosphere that is also really interesting. It's kind of creepy at first, the first half hour is deathly silent and you don't have a clue what's going to spring out at you. <br/><br/>The acting is great, Weaver, who plays Ripley, is astounding as one of the first female lead roles in Science Fiction films. The acting in this movie is awesome. They're not your average flawless super heroes you get in films these days, they're are actually real people who are just as scared of this thing as you. <br/><br/>The atmosphere of this movie really is creepy. It gives you goosebumps right from the beginning. You're sitting there just thinking, ""Oh god, something is going to happen isn't it? I KNOW something bad is going to happen!"" It's just got that chilling atmosphere that you don't see enough of these days. <br/><br/>The alien itself is really creatively designed. As usual, it's humanoid, like most alien films. But this one is different because you don't actually learn that much about the alien. It seems emotionless really. You don't ever find out if it has any flaws or emotions. All you know is that it's a cold hearted and very dangerous killer. With acid for blood and two mouths for some reason. <br/><br/>So yeah, the only flaw I could point out about this film (pushing its age aside) is the slowness to it. But I guess that just adds up to the suspense. If it was all rushed, it would have probably been less interesting. And you have to respect the fact that this film is a true science fiction classic and always will be."
"greencreaturestudio","9","1","3","17 February 2015"," A Clastrophobic Piece of Art
","Alien is easily up there with the likes of The Shining and Pan's Labyrinth with how it creates it owns form of horror, distant from the clichéd techniques to scare people featured in nowadays films. The colour scheme and lighting help create the atmosphere, along with the concept of the fact that 'in space, no-one can hear you scream'. Different from its successor in the brilliant although not as intense Aliens, Alien, doesn't edge you towards the edge of your seat, it kicks you. The aliens design is terrifying and original, the characters are strong and unique. Despite negative press around the 3rd & 4th sequels, and Somme mixed reviews with Prometheus, Aliem was, and remains a true piece of cinematic art, a masterpiece responsible for influencing countless other filmmakers and audiences members over its nearly 36 year existence. Alien is a masterpiece, one hopes Ridley Scott can return to making. A must watch film. A classic. You have no excuse to never see it."
"deepkamate","9","1","3","6 February 2015"," Alien on the ship!
","You know, analyzing the classics, it is difficult to say about it is something new, because over the years of its existence - everything has already been said about you. A thousand opinions, both positive and negative, which is set out everything that could be said. Still want to express my humble opinion and. ""Alien"" - recognized as a classic of cinema and an example of how to look good sci-fi film. He is a dark, largely original so much that at one time caused fear and loathing among the audience. This is just the very emotions that are making, shooting horror - extreme sensations. But what is the problem any classics? Over time, it ceases to impress.<br/><br/>Do not get me wrong, ""Alien"" I liked it. He has an interesting story, more or less distinct moments of dialogue and he continues to impress, but unfortunately, now it will not see something like that, that would impress. Personally, I was able to see him only recently, and sometimes I frankly bored. They showed us the life of the ship, without going into details, the local customs and, in fact, that very little stranger with a funny head and a nice little tongue with his own mouth. The problem is that reigns around an illusion that the characters are revealed. Yes, there is a scene where they talk, sad, think about the inevitable end, but nothing makes for them to worry. Unknown garbage guy jumped on the face - suddenly, but so what? Bearded captain grabbed someone else - and I should be sorry for him? Yes, the whole team crumbled into the meat, and the only character for the fate of which I experienced - cat, who kept running around the ship. Yes, even the heroine Sigourney Weaver aroused little emotion (although I often enrage women in movies, and she did not even annoying. This is cool). Agree, when more worried about the fate of the stranger, who kills everyone on the ship - this is not good.<br/><br/>Faceless characters - this is probably the biggest problem of this movie, but there are those that have emerged over time. And it is not the fault of the director or the picture itself. This high expectations and the fact that since its premiere has been more than 30 years. Many have told me that it is almost the best thing they've ever seen. What is the worst movie in the world, and now it looks even better than many modern horror. But let's face it - it's not. The film has lost its former luster and after that pile of special effects, which are presented to us from blockbuster blockbuster - popping up from the chest of another man germ does not cause old emotions. I, for example, long whinnying on this nice little toothy puppet. And, you know, I would not have found fault with things like that, if I had not been told that it looks better than ""Avatar"" in Trid. My expectations were too high involuntarily, and it played a role.<br/><br/>However, I repeat - I really liked the movie. Decorations for 1979 look cool, actors try, some scenes continue to evoke emotion - ""Oh! ** Them yourself! "". The very fact that in the future each of the characters has become a stereotype in these films - makes it a classic. It really says a lot. And I would like to do a little comparison with the prequel, which was released in 2012 - ""Prometheus"". I know it's not fair, but the situation is very similar. Frankly, ""Prometheus"" I looked first and could not understand why it is not very well accepted. But now, seeing the sequel (funny that he appeared 33 years earlier), I realized that for his fans criticized. This is 75% of the same film. Evil cyborg trying to explore the unknown creature, the death of the team, the destruction of the ship, talking head. Damn, even the birth of the embryo of another's stomach! Unfortunately, the remaining 25% - trumped-up nonsense. In this regard, ""Alien"" wins. As if the ""Prometheus"" - it's not a prequel, but a kind of remake. But again, this proves how cool ""Alien"" that it wants to raise from the ashes.<br/><br/>As a result, we have a typical classic, once laid the foundation of the genre, but for now, while the more impressive projects looking to modern audiences as a cheap set of clichés. Of course, many praising the film and will beat me with sticks for what I said about him that something bad. I understand why, I just did a more modern audience the same ""Prometheus"" has given me more pleasure. ""Alien"" I liked, I recognize his contribution to cinema, but for me - it is not a masterpiece. I do not blame me."
"brianberta","9","1","3","3 February 2015"," A classic sci-fi movie with a terrifying monster
","Ridley Scott delivers a movie that combines horror and sci-fi in such a way making it into a terrific classic film. The movie centers around a group of people answering a distress signal from a planet only to have an alien make it onto the ship and they have to kill it before it kills them. As soon as the Alien makes it on their ship, the film provides a tense ride as the crew is offed one by one. The acting was fine on all parts and the cgi was pretty good for the time. This might get boring for some people but fans of sci-fi and horror will most likely enjoy the film. Director Ridley Scott did a great job setting up a plausible environment. It is pretty realistic and it didn't take the path that most horror movies nowadays take. The lighting and camera effects make the alien look like one of the most terrifying cgi monsters of the decade. This movie took the original alien movie formula that most movies of the 50's and 60's took and spiced it up adding new elements. It takes a simple plot and it turns it into a masterpiece. If you are a fan of sci-fi and horror then this movie is for you. It's one of the best horror films ever made."
"mcmahongamer851999","8","1","3","1 January 2015"," Has aged surprisingly well!
","To think that ""ALIEN"" was made nearly 40 years ago is pretty incredible. The film, especially on the phenomenal new blu-ray, looks incredible, and has aged very, very well.<br/><br/>One way the film still looks excellent is because of Ridley Scott's heavy use of practical effects and models. The sets, in particular the alien spaceship, look realistic and amazing.<br/><br/>It also works well as a horror movie. The isolation of the spaceship and the incredible, yet believable, indestructibility of the alien makes for an intense, claustrophobic atmosphere.<br/><br/>Having said all of these great things, there are some points that show the film's age. The old computers look clunky and almost hilarious, and some of the CG, like the explosion of the ship at the end, looks cheesy. Nonetheless, this is one of the better horror films from the 19th century, and still worth a watch."
"JaydoDre","9","1","3","28 December 2014"," Simply a great film
","There is so much great about Alien that it is hard to know where to start. Let us start with the title screen. Against the background of outer space the word Alien is very slowly formed, setting right from the start the tense pacing of the film.<br/><br/>The film is about a crew of a spaceship dealing with a hostile alien encounter. The movie is actually built on a relatively cliché horror movie formula. However, it does that formula very well and layers some really interesting material on top of it, which makes this movie unique. For example like many other horror movies, it resorts to a lot of jump scares, which may be a cheap tactic, but the jump scares are done well. The movie also follows the formula of separating a group of people and killing them one by one, but the way this plays out and the reasons for the separations feel fairly sensible.<br/><br/>Not everything in the storyline makes sense and it is not a perfectly smooth ride, but the blemishes are very insignificant.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Alien is one of the most original looking films and its looks hold up well even today. The mock up models of the main space ship unfortunately look like plastic. The inside of the ship on the other hand looks awesome. The light off-white design of living quarters mixed with dark industrial corridors looks very nice. The old CRT computer screens and the mechanical keyboards do look outdated but, not only do they fit well with the overall design, the austere small screens with their static and few colors also add to the overall creepiness and claustrophobic mechanic feel of the environment. <br/><br/>The alien designs were done by the wonderfully insane H. R. Giger. His designs are very unique and nightmarish but at the same time believable and natural looking. When you see an alien move inside an egg it looks very real. The alien mechanics and designs are sexualized. One of the writers for the movie claimed that the story symbolizes rape. I do not know just how consciously the male writers were integrating that subject matter into the film, but if you look at the design and at H.R. Geiger's work on which the alien design was based, there are very clearly human sexual organs involved. <br/><br/>Sadly, the technological limitations mean that while the design of the creatures is cool, when those creatures move, it looks bad and in some cases unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>And the sound design, oh the sound design is responsible for about 40% of the creepiness factor of this film. Chilly space-music with little to no rhythm is mixed with various sound effects that are not always caused by anything specific on screen but that nonetheless integrate themselves into the visuals very nicely.<br/><br/>All the Little bits contribute to this movie's unforgettable atmosphere. There is a brief scene where the characters just quickly go over the composition of the alien planet before they go outside. Was the scene really necessary? No, but is a great way to establish atmosphere. The distorted shaky images of the helmet cams, the cramped conditions and the creepy sound effects combine to make a most intense film.<br/><br/>The actor performances feel very real. It is believable right from the start that the crew members are people who have been working together before. In fact, I read that the director actually made the actors spend time together so that when filming started they would be well acquainted. However, a minor complaint is appropriate about the lack of shock or surprise in the crew members when some of the messed up events take place. <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver plays the part of the intelligent strong woman officer who tries to stay calm and stay in control of the situation. She was an important ingredient in this film. She made it into every subsequent Alien movie and for a good reason. My favorite actor besides Sigourney is Yaphet Kotto as one of the mechanics. He feels the most natural, like an actual worker of the ship.<br/><br/>This film is not perfection. Not all of the scenes may be strictly necessary and not everything looks timeless and not all dialogue has a purpose and the performances are not Oscar worthy, but taken as a whole, Alien is such an interesting and effective film that it can be rightfully called one of the best movies of all time."

","Twelve years before I entered this world this movie came to be. 35 years later I watched this movie yet again, and yet again I am left breathless. <br/><br/>This is one of my top five movies. I have always enjoyed sci-fi, and I have always enjoyed a good chill down my spine. The tag line for this film says enough about the atmosphere ""In Space No One Can Hear You Scream"". <br/><br/>The story is simple, yet effective. A cargo crew trapped on their own ship being the prey of an alien, which was brought unto the ship. <br/><br/>The cast is well rounded and there is a natural feeling that they are bored and annoyed about being on the ship. They have only one wish; to get home to earth. The tension is easy to see between them, all hissing at each other. The alien itself is beautifully made for the time, and it is pretty scary. The setting is amazing. Everything is thought off. The alien spaceship is mysterious and if you haven't watched Prometheus then you will still wonder what it is. The cargo ship is a great set filled with loads of details. <br/><br/>The whole concept of fear is so elegantly used. Fear of the unknown - what is this alien. The fear within the crew, who can you trust, is someone against you? And then Ridley Scott put the setting down on the fear. Narrow corridors, great camera work and a dark lighting. <br/><br/>This movie is so simple to me: fear and isolation. How do you cope with that?"
"GeorgeRoots","10","1","3","28 June 2014"," Arguably The Best Sci-Fi Horror Ever Made.
","I am 22 and what can I say about this movie? If there's anything I can say, ""Alien"" is the film I ask every adult about how they felt at the time of the movies release. My dad went to go see it and reminds me it was one of his fondest memories as a moviegoer. Based on the highly sexualised pieces by surrealist H.R Giger. He & Ridley Scott have arguably created science fiction's greatest villain, in a movie series that has been adapted to comics, video games etc. The list goes on.<br/><br/>Workers of the spaceship ""Nostromo"", pick up a distress signal on a nearby planet and reluctantly respond. One unlucky worker (Lets face it) ends up raped via a strange species wrapped tight around his face, and removal seems futile as the creatures blood is highly corrosive. Eventually it falls off and everything seems back to normal, then the stuff of your deepest nightmares happen and suddenly your trapped in a cage with a savage life form.<br/><br/>Still, John Hurt's death is the highlight of the movie, if not one of the most iconic in all of cinema. Hilarious it is to know, that none of the actors knew what was going to happen. Hurt, Ian Holm and of course Sigourney Weaver deliver their career best performances.<br/><br/>And of course, I want to say how this movie personally affects me. The ""Alien"" franchise was one of the last movie serials me and my family all viewed together, before various members went off to start their own families (Though we started with ""Aliens"", it didn't matter). After finally viewing ""Alien"" and seeing how Ridley created a movie set in tight corridors where the walls hiss and bellow smoke at you, nothing and nobody was safe. Ripley is without doubt cinemas greatest heroine and her fears become yours, rarely do movies give their characters such engrossing traits.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Alien only gets better with age and viewing. Utterly fantastic cinema you should be watching, as there will never be anything like it. 10/10. Do yourself a favour and check out the early trailers."
"mrrockey","8","1","3","15 June 2014"," A True Horror Classic
","Alien is a film that survives on the strength of its atmosphere, chills, and unpredictability. Without those things, the film might not be remembered for anything other than for being the starting ground for Sigourney Weaver. But since we have a haunting atmosphere, effective scares, and an unpredictable screenplay, we get one of the most iconic horror films ever made. But what makes these things in Alien work? Let's find out!<br/><br/>The plot of Alien follows a commercial towing spaceship by the name of Nostromo being sent to investigate a shipwreck on a mysterious, foreign planet where they encounter a strange alien being that attaches itself to one of the crew members faces with no way to get rid of it. It eventually detaches itself from his face, only then to have a creature violently burst out of his chest, killing him in the process. It then grows into a bigger alien who silently picks off the crew members one by one.<br/><br/>The main strengths of Alien are the atmosphere, chills, and unpredictability. This film features an incredibly haunting, eerie atmosphere that just intrigues you from beginning to end. The visuals hook you in from the moment the movie starts with these slow pans of different areas of the ship and the slow reveal of the movie's title. With the complete lack of sound and slow cuts, it gives you a sense of isolation and dread right away. Then, they approach the mysterious planet and we get some truly unique-looking visuals that look just as strange and alien to us as it does for the main characters. The camera-work is very creepy with the way it lingers on certain things without any reasoning in the film to do so, leaving us very lost just like the crew members themselves. The film DOES simmer down the eerieness a bit when they go back to the ship but once the alien pops out of Kane's chest, it goes back to being unsettling again knowing that it could pop out anywhere in this dark, claustrophobic environment. I could go on and on about how effective the atmosphere in the film is but to sum it up, it's one of the key factors to the film's success.<br/><br/>This is also a pretty terrifying film. While it takes its time to build up its scares, when it strikes, it always works. They build those moments up for SO long, when it happens, you often don't expect it so it scares the sh!t out of you. The alien itself is terrifying in its design and conception. It has a very black, gooey look in close-ups with an extra set of teeth inside its mouth which is pretty freaky, but in long shots, it has an oddly phallic, almost fetishistic look to it. In fact, the way the alien is written has a kinda rapish feel to it the entire time. Think about it, he grabs you when you least expect it, causes you to pass out, and then impregnates you while you're unconscious. I know this sounds really strange and some of you are probably gonna call me a sick pervert for thinking something like this but I think this was the filmmaker's intention, because it adds a disturbing edge on a psychological level and it makes the film scarier than had it just relied on loud noises to scare you like a lot of horror films today.<br/><br/>But my favorite thing about the film has to be its unpredictability. Even though this is pretty straight-forward plot, the way it develops is very unpredictable and intriguing. For example, when the alien first bursts out and grabs onto Kane's face, it feels so unexpected because has been very quiet and slow up to this point, so it completely surprises you and makes you interested to see the rest of the film. When Kane's taken back to the ship, everything the alien does is surprising. When one of them tries to use a saw to cut it off his face, it bleeds acid. Just when it gets off Kane's face and he seems just fine, all of a sudden, an alien POPS right out of his chest! And if that's not enough, there's a plot twist that the ship's science officer, Ash, is an android! It turns out that he's been sent to bring the alien back to the crew's employers to use as a weapon. That itself is fascinating and it makes the film's universe feel a whole lot bigger. It's these things that keep the film consistently interesting.<br/><br/>Lastly, I want to point out the film's performances, effects, sound design. While the characters in the film have been criticized by some critics for not having much personality, I thought they were all well- defined and they all felt like real people to me. They're not technobabble-speaking geniuses from Star Trek, they're just like normal folks delivering a package by boat. The standout performance is Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. While she doesn't develop into an action hero yet(that happens in the sequel), Weaver has a believable authoritative presence on screen. When she's taking charge of what to do about the alien, you buy it. But she can also sell being scared and paranoid in a claustrophobic environment with a deadly alien around convincingly. It's a very tough balance to strike but Weaver pulls it off well. The film also won an Oscar for special effects and it definitely deserves it. The miniature and model work for the Nostromo looks incredibly convincing and all the alien effects have an organic look that can't be replicated in CGI. The sound design is very eerie with a discomforting silence for the majority of the film but also some really strange, unusual sounds for the alien that sound incredibly disturbing.<br/><br/>Overall, Alien is a classic with a haunting atmosphere, effective scares, an unpredictable screenplay, a strong lead performance, and some excellent technicals. 9/10"

","Ridley Scott's Alien really kept me on the edge of my seat with it's Hitchcock level suspense and especially the excellent performances throughout, and the haunting score by Jerry Goldsmith. Director Ridley Scott can make make a science fiction movie into a horror masterpiece. The movie also compares to sci-fi classics like Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Avatar, Inception, Planet of the Apes, E.T. The Extra Errestrial, Transformers, Iron Man, Men in Black, Jurassic Park, and Minority Report. But there was an outstanding cast to this horror classic such as, Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit, Ian Holm, and John Hurt. Also of which is one of the best movies of 1979 because of the wonderful acting, the haunting score, and the masterful direction by the legendary Ridley Scott."
"hnt_dnl","10","1","3","7 June 2014"," Sci fi horror classic!
","ALIEN (1979) is a film that I overlooked back in the day. In the 80s the decade where I really started to see a lot of movies and could process them, sci-fi movies were mostly action vehicles, even some of the best of the decade (The Terminator, Robocop, Predator, The Hidden), but each remains watchable because they all have wonderful characterizations, memorable dialogue, and most importantly a provocative story that underlied the action. The irony is the perhaps the most revered sci- fi action movie of the 80s was ""Aliens"", which is the ""sequel"" to this movie that I'm reviewing. Sadly, ""Aliens"" is rated higher on this site than those aforementioned superior sci-fi movies and the SAME rating as this movie, it's predecessor ""Alien"", which is by leaps and bounds much better. ""Aliens"" is a hamburger with Coca-Cola, while ""Alien"" is steak with red wine! <br/><br/>The film sports an absolutely superb cast: Tom Skerritt (Captain Dallas), Sigourney Weaver (Ripley, second officer), Ian Holm (Ash, medical officer), Veronica Cartwright (Lambert, communications), John Hurt (Kane, first officer), Yaphet Kotto (Parker, engineer), and Harry Dean Stanton (Brett,technician), all who inhabit their characters convincingly. The actors play well off each other, with their interactions never seeming forced.<br/><br/>Directed by innovator Ridley Scott, ""Alien"" is actually a feasible representation of the future. Set around the mid-22nd century, this tight, linear tale begins as a mining ship, the Nostromo, is in deep space with it's crew in hibernation on it's way back to Earth with a wealth of mineral ore. The crew works for the Weyland Corporation, who owns the ship. A distress call from a relatively nearby planet forces the ship's computer to wake up the crew and they go to begrudgingly investigate. The trio Dallas, Lambert, Kane go on a search party to find an alien ship with it's long-dead pilot and a collection of large eggs, one of which bursts open and a ""face-hugging"" creature attaches itself to Kane.<br/><br/>The special effects, everything from the ship design to the planet settings, are still very eye-popping and believable to this day. Nothing over-the-top or dated. One can imagine something like this happening, which is scary! In particular, the effects of the alien remain impressive, perhaps the best design of an alien creature in all of film history. The progression of the creature throughout the film from face-hugger to full-blown alien builds the tension and the crew's terror and horror is palpable. The film takes the ""less is more"" approach to horror, by presenting the creature almost like a boogey-man, who pops out at you unexpectedly in your worst nightmares.<br/><br/>In re-visiting this classic recently, I was surprised at how short the film's running time was to how I remembered it. I always thought of this movie as a very long film, but it's not really. Everything actually moves at a brisk pace, with the characters driving the story keeping us invested in their survival. And ""Alien"" is the type of film that isn't just shoe-horned into one genre. It skillfully combines elements of sci-fi, horror, and drama. Superior in every way to it's sequels, ""Alien"" is the real keeper of the franchise!"

","Terrifying. That is the only word to describe one of the most iconic films of the 1970s.The film is set in the distant future where the commercial vessel Nostromo receives a distress call from an unexplored planet. After searching for survivors, the crew heads home only to realize that a deadly bioform has joined them. For me, this is director Ridley Scott at his very best. He has created a sci-fi masterpiece full of intensity and thrills. The chestburster scene has been watched more than the actual film itself. The acting of Sigourney Weaver must be applauded, one of the first ever Sci-Fi heroins, she gave a fantastic performance as Ellen Ripley. The passion she put into her performance was stunning and she made the film even more scary! An iconic film, with an iconic extra-terrestrial species that has struck fear into the average viewer since 1979."
"pvtsew","Null","1","3","19 March 2014"," Up there
","The movie starts in space on the rings of some planet. The mining vessel ""Nostromo"" is on its return voyage, but the crew is unexpectedly awaken from its hyper sleep because the ship has received an ""intelligent"" signal. The crew wakes up happy, thinking they are almost home. Everything goes down hill when they realize what's going on and that they have to explore some inhospitable planet. A portion of the crew goes off and Kane (John Hurt) is attacked by some parasite. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) tries to keep the crew from getting back in, fearing infection, but Ash (Ian Holm) lets the explorers in anyway. Eventually, an organism bursts out of Kane's stomach and runs amok on the ship. Kane is left dead, then Brett, then Dallas, then Ash, then finally Parker and Lambert. Ash, however, is murdered by the surviving crew after it was revealed he was an android and tried to hide an attempt to capture the alien instead of helping the crew with their original mission.<br/><br/>This film is definitely the best scifi I've seen, perhaps ever. It has nice long talking sequences (after they wake up) and great seems of the ship (inside and out). Ripley Scott conceded in the commentary to have been heavily influenced by Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" and this is obvious. However ""Alien"" maintains its uniqueness being much darker. The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith also keeps it haunting and more a horror movie than the classical score of 2001. <br/><br/>It's also less overt. I took at as a very good portrait of large corporate policy. A couple of the people are paid a lot less than the rest of the crew (one of them is black) and they want to make more money but aren't really taken seriously. It also has the secret android which is good because many times corporations don't keep their policies open. I always find it important that scifi movies have some type of statement. After all, we cannot talk about the future without keeping in mind what is going on in the present. <br/><br/>To sum it up, it is slow paced and powerful. It is haunting and inspiring (the survival of the cat). It's a high recommend to everyone."
"costigan95-712-931904","10","1","3","3 January 2014"," One of a Kind
","It's hard to describe what kind of film Alien is. It's not quite in the genre of horror, or sci-fi. While it does contain many themes of both genres, I consider it in a genre of its own. This cinematic masterpiece is a testament to what makes films great. It keeps the viewers attention and doesn't resort to cheap scares or effects. It uses what I feel is the most effective tool in a suspense movie; the fear of the unknown. While I'm sure those of you who have not seen the movie know what the titular alien looks like, the filmmakers are in no rush to show the beast. If you re-watch the movie, you can see it hiding in the shadows at some points, but besides those subtle details, much of the fear is created by your own imagination. Please watch this film if you haven't."

","Space may still be the final frontier, but after seeing ALIEN, one can't help but reconsider discovering it. Far into the future, and far out into the reaches of deep space, workers on-board the NOSTROMO, a mining ship, are wakened out of cryogenic sleep because the ship's sensors have picked up a supposed SOS from a nearby planet. Amid the crew's bickering and complaints about ""fair wages,"" they decide to investigate. Upon setting down on the environmentally-torn planet, their ship sustains damage that requires them to stay put until repairs can be made. So a small team, headed by Kane (played by John Hurt) choose to explore the source of the SOS. And what they find is incredible, the remains of a downed spacecraft. Venturing inside, they find evidence of the ship's inhabitants, in particular a fossilized corpse in a chair with a gaping hole in its chest. Still going further into the ship, they find the hold full of what appear to be eggs. One opens up and something jumps out, attaching itself to Kane's face. Against the better judgment of Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver) the team is let back on-board the ship. And I won't tell you anymore, except that an alien is let loose on-board that proceeds to kill the crew. For those of you unfamiliar with ALIEN, I won't reveal one of the greatest and most graphic special effects in sci-fi history. Only to say, you'll never think of enjoying a relaxing meal around the dinner table quite the same way again. The film works so well because it's basically a haunted house set in deep space. As one by one, the various characters are forced to investigate darkened corridors, air shafts, the occasional weird noises and so forth. Everything from the lighting, use of shadows and darkness, to the unsettling sounds of the ship itself, lend to the mounting tension. So watch this and be prepared to scream. But if you're in space, don't expect anyone to hear you!"
"Progressive-Element","10","1","3","24 May 2013"," In space no-one can scream AWESOME
","Which is a shame, as other lifeforms will probably enjoy Ridley Scott's phenomenal sci-fi horror classic.<br/><br/>This is one of those films where everything fits perfectly. Direction, cast, visuals, score, atmosphere, editing, pacing. Made two years after Fox's licence to print money Star Wars, their next big sci-fi hit couldn't be anymore different. Much like Star Wars, Alien draws on older movies for inspiration, such as It the Terror From Beyond Space, Planet of the Vampires, Forbidden Planet, The Thing From Another World, etc. And like Star Wars, it presents B-movie thrills with an A-pic budget, and treats its material seriously. If you could liken Star Wars to a cliffhanger serial for modern kids, Alien is like the old B-movie space monster films for a modern adult audience.<br/><br/>While Alien is mostly set in the far reaches of space, on a large spaceship, much of the action takes place in tight, suffocatingly claustrophobic spaces. Few films before or since have made one feel anxious about what lies behind the next corner, or makes us grip the edge of our seats as we prowl through dark corridors lit only by flashing emergency lights. This is one film that is best seen with all the lights off.<br/><br/>The whole cast are excellent, again putting this miles beyond mere monster fodder. Tom Skerritt is great as the laid-back captain Dallas, uncomfortable with taking responsibilities. Veronica Cartwright may irritate as Lambert, constantly on the verge of hysteria, but given the circumstances it's understandable. Harry Dean Stanton is another laid-back character, engineer Brett, saying 'Right' after Parker says anything, but also sly, and smarter than he seems - witness him silently prompting Parker to discuss bonus benefits. John Hurt perhaps doesn't get that many chances to shine as Kane. His character though often seems a little too eager to jump before looking - his overt inquisitiveness proves to be his downfall. Ian Holm is cold and manipulative as Ash and is always good value for money. Yaphet Kotto is terrific as Parker, Brett's engineering partner, whose only motivation is money. Of course, none of them ever quite had the impact that a then-unknown actress by the name of Sigourney Weaver had, playing the tough no-nonsense Ripley, a character who became just as iconic in the Alien series as the monsters. Much like Kurt in the 1982 The Thing, Ripley isn't really front-and-centre at first, simply being the third highest-ranking crew-member after Dallas and Kane. But it soon becomes apparent, even in the face of danger, she has the strength to pull herself together. Always professional, easily the most sympathetic character.<br/><br/>The alien itself is still a marvel to look at, burning itself into our collective memories. With humanoid, insect, reptilian, even mechanical-like features, it is a true nightmare creation, a horribly efficient killing machine. It also has the best entrance any movie monster ever had, literally, in one of the all-time great cinematic shocks. Also memorable, are the derelict spacecraft on the barren planetoid, the dead creature in the chair, the alien eggs, and of course the facehugger.<br/><br/>Although the infamous chestbursting scene is still pretty graphic, this film relies more on atmosphere and suspense than blood'n'guts, and is all the better for it, manipulating our imaginations to the max.<br/><br/>Special effects-wise, it has held up remarkably over the years, even more so than it's sequels. The Nostromo is impressive in both the impression of scale given to it, and it's future low-tech look. Production design is even more impressive, this is a film that, even if it had not been a success, was still impressive to look at.<br/><br/>One factor that remains timeless is the world in which Alien inhabits. This is no future of benevolent Federations and gleaming starships, this is a down'n'dirty corporate-driven future, where profit is favoured over human lives. The Nostromo is frequently in need of maintenance, built just to do it's job. The crew are not uniformed heroes, but blue-collar workers, characters any audience, from 1979 to today can relate to. There is even something of a class divide - the engineers working down below are paid less than officers high above them.<br/><br/>Alien will remain an all-time classic long after it's would-be imitators - not to mention a few sequels and spin-offs - have faded from memory."

After finding the minerals they were sent out to find the crew goes into a cryo sleep to wake when they arrive back on earth but are waken prematurely after receiving a distress call. they follow the signal and discover a strange creature that could bring the end to them all. The movie has a very amusive and compelling storyline griping you from beginning to end. Not only is it well written but the director Ridley Scott manages to capture the lonely emptiness of space perfectly. Every scene is wonderfully lite and props are perfect, not to mention the swooping camera angles that add to the shaky uneasy horror segments. Along side all these elements you have one of the most iconic and all around greatest horror creature, the xenomorph, perfectly designed to be a killing machine with more weapons in its arsenal than you can shake a stick at. All around alien is a movie that will continue to be great, not many films can still seem relatively believable all these years later. i give alien a 9 out of 10 its a must see for all true movie buffs."
"gottschalkchris23-2","9","1","3","31 December 2012"," The Perfect Clashing of Genres
","Throughout the 20th Century, film grew into different genres pretty quickly. Comedies, horror film, science fiction, fantasy... all harvest a different reaction out of audiences. However, enter the nuclear-period of the 1950s and you find that science fiction films were often meant scare audiences. This is what influenced a whole sub-genre of film to stick around, even to this day -- Sci-fi Horror. We've seen science fiction and horror cross many times in many different movies, but one film that stands out as the perfect example is Ridley Scott's Alien.<br/><br/>It makes sense that Alien was released in 1979. Horror was extremely marketable in mainstream cinema throughout the 1970s, and with the release of Star Wars in 1977, it would only make sense that movie interests and goals would collide. Many scenes in Alien are filmed similar to Star Wars - slow and prolonged images of space-craft, close- ups of computer monitors, and slow-motion shots of the interior of the space-craft that allow the viewer to completely realize the futuristic technology that the characters live with. People were fascinated with this stuff in the 1970s, and improving special effects certainly helped. Though the special effects in Alien were outmatched in its sequels, they still hold up even by today's standards. The cinematography is fantastic, and the overall look of the film in stunning.<br/><br/>Perhaps the reason that the film looks so good is the fact that it doesn't allow any opportunity for the audience to see it as cheesy. Alien moves at an extremely slow and dry pace, allowing no room for comic relief. Yet, even in its slow pace, Alien manages to grasp attention for the full run time. Even on re-watches, details or images that you've missed are fascinating, and the feeling that you are on a distressed ship in the middle of space with a crew in danger is convincing. Alien is claustrophobic, but it manages to make use of the small setting of a spaceship work for the full 117 minute run time. <br/><br/>Aside from the fantastic suspense and great special effects, Alien is still a good film on its own. While the story carried along is essentially an over-the-top slasher movie set in space, characters are developed very well. While the whole cast is good, Sigourny Weaver appears in the role that she will forever be remembered for - Ripley. I also liked the characters of Parker and Brett, which brought real world emotion to a situation that none of us have ever dealt with.<br/><br/>Alien, in its serious tone, is also a pretty suspenseful film! The audience actually cares about the characters, the alien actually poses a real threat, and there are several spots which are crafted perfectly to make you jump. The air vent scene and the chest-burst scene stand out in my mind as shocking, but of course the entire climax near the end of the film keeps viewers on the edge of their seats until the credits flash. Again, there is no room for comic relief in this film, so prepare yourself for an intense experience. There is plenty of violence and gore to satisfy the horror fans, and the violence isn't cheesy. However, horror fans SHOULD be warned that this isn't a fun fright flick. People who go into this expecting a lot of action will be disappointed. Alien is slow and proper, yet packs a punch. Like a fine wine with the alcoholic percentage of bourbon.<br/><br/>This is a film made very ahead of its time. In fact, when re-released in 2003, nothing was changed from the original theatrical cut to the 2003 director's cut with the exception of dialouge scenes. A science fiction film that was heavily based on special effects in 1979 STILL shocking audiences in the 21st Century? That is what makes this film a horror classic."

I would like to start with the Xenomorph, that beast is likely to send chills down your spine, the design is great thanks to Giger. The atmosphere and the music mix together so well It's unbelievable. I always liked how dark and mysterious the whole planet was, I wanted to see more of it. The cast is believable for once in a horror movie. The Nostromo itself is another great part about the film, it's huge and dark.You get the feeling of isolation, and the fact the alien could be anywhere puts you at constant suspense. This film is my all time favourite horror movie.<br/><br/>This film should be viewed at least once in a lifetime, in my opinion a lot more than once."
"ignacio-mig14","7","1","3","22 August 2012"," Ripley's a perfect horror heroine here.
","The main reason that makes this a great movie for me is that is totally focused on the alien story, makes you feel their desperation from being alone with that thing in outer space all through the film, there's no rest for anything else. Plus the effects (for instance, Ash's scene) are great for 1979. But Ripley steals the show, played brilliantly by Sigourney Weaver, here's a character I can feel totally identified with. She reflects my ideal concept of a woman heroine in this movie. Her look, expressions, every move is perfect. None of that happens on Cameron's sequel, when they added a little girl so we can cheer for her and cry, I assume, which I didn't, and Ripley is turned into a sentimental Rambo with big weapons, losing all the enigmatic charm I loved so much here. This is the best movie Ridley Scott has ever made, even when the last scene could have been better for my taste, and surpasses by far Cameron's ""Aliens"", which is just a very dumb version of Terminator. I highly recommend Alien as a sci-fi horror, along with John Carpenter's The Thing. 8/10."
"ViktorDrake","10","1","3","15 June 2012"," Still the finest sci-fi horror
","In light of the recent release of the terrible semi-prequels Prometheus and Alien:Covenant, I thought it was time to return to the original Alien movie to see how they compare.<br/><br/>To be honest, almost 40 years after it was made, Alien still has yet to be bettered as one of the finest sci-fi horror movies ever made. It's impossible for me to find fault in this movie, even after having seen it around 10 times. Everything about it is perfect - the set and costume design, the cast, the production, the script, the effects.... everything.<br/><br/>The claustrophobia of the Nostromo has only ever been bettered by John Carpenter's The Thing, and the vision of an alien planet when they set down on LV-426 couldn't be further away from the sanitised view of space that we see in the likes of Star Trek. This movie shows space exactly as I'd imagine it - cold, violent and inhospitable.<br/><br/>The HR Giger designed Alien has become an undisputed classic of design, and rightly so, with the practical effects looking infinitely better than the CGI of the later movies. The cast are all spot-on and believable - Dallas, Lambert, Ash, Parker, Kane, Ripley... all of them are absolutely real and believable (and in TOTAL contrast to the nonsensical and frankly ludicrous characters we find in Prometheus and Covenant). In short, Alien is still one of the finest sci-fi horror movies ever made even after almost 40 years... and that is some achievement."
"sandy-462","10","1","3","6 June 2012"," Why Alien works and why the rest of its family doesn't.
","It's not the design, the pacing, the performances, the cast or the director - those things are certainly very powerful contributions to the whole, but the real reason Alien works so well is because of the storytelling.<br/><br/>It's a fable, whose message is ""Don't stray from the path. There are things out there in the world that have nothing to do with you and your little human agendas"" – a very simple story with a very simple message. It's comparable to a fairy-tale - there are even seven protagonists, like seven brothers, the last one, the virtuous one, being the one that gets the reward at the end of the story. This is an extreme version of the story, so the ""youngest son""s treasure is to be allowed to live.<br/><br/>All the wrong ways of dealing with a dangerous unknown are tested in the story, and responded to in order of the seriousness of the error, the worst error coming first.<br/><br/>1. Kane - the Dreamer. He is driven by a desire to look into the unknown. Alone among the protagonists, when faced with the colossal derelict, he demands that they must go on. He desires - what? Fame? Knowledge? Discovery? Whatever it is it gets the better of him because he isn't reacting to the threat properly so he gets it in the face, quite literally. His attitude to the unknown is unforgivably stupid - anyone can see that what he's walking towards is dangerous. He doesn't care, driven by egotism, so he dies first, because he actively *welcomes* the danger.<br/><br/>2. Brett - the Ignorant. The most suspense-filled scene is saved for him, because his reaction to the unknown, in story-telling terms, is the least understandable, and is so unacceptable and counter-instinctive that his character flaw is directly responsible for his demise. The suspense in that scene is contributed to heavily by pacing, cinematography and performance, but the cause of the tension is that we *know* Brett and we know that he *doesn't pay any goddamn attention to anything*. He doesn't CARE about the dangerous unknown. That's what makes that scene unbearable. If it was any of the others in that situation, the scene wouldn't be so strong.<br/><br/>3. Dallas - the Pedant. He treats the unknown as a known, refusing to recognise it. His strategy is to take small, rational steps, each decision in its time and one after the other. He ignores the bigger picture and... beautiful metaphor... he ends up trapped in a maze, bogged down by details. The irises closing behind him are opportunities for escape that he ignores because he can't make a decision based on feelings. He dies third because he only follows rules, to his doom.<br/><br/>4. Ash - the Traitor. This role is the most difficult and pulled off beautifully by Ian Holm. His flaw is his belief that the situation can be controlled, and to his own advantage, but events, of course, spiral out of his control. It's his willingness to sacrifice his crew members that makes him inhuman, not the fact that he's an android, which is no more than an ""inhuman"" costume to dress up the idea of treachery in (and it's a very effective costume). His inhumanity is his undoing, and it's sufficiently grotesque that we don't even need the monster to kill him for him to meet an appropriate end. But at least he recognises that the situation has to be controlled, so he's the fourth to die.<br/><br/>5. Parker - the Courageous. He very nearly reacts entirely sensibly to the threat, clearly understanding that Kane needs to be frozen (he feels unknown must be faced only when the humans are back home and have the upper hand), allowing his emotions to dictate his actions (which is entirely appropriate – the situation he's in is what the emotion of fear is designed for) and so doesn't die until very late, but he's undone in the end by his protection of Lambert, the Coward. It's a very unfair death, but he has to die because someone has to die for Lambert, because the story of the Coward always costs one more life than just that of the Coward.<br/><br/>6. Lambert - the Coward. The Coward knows what is coming but she just can't deal with it. She's all nerves and no action, all feeling and no focus. She knows what's coming in her bones right from the beginning, her reaction is very close to being correct, so she's the last to die.<br/><br/>7. Ripley - the Hero. Ripley is the only person who reacts sensibly to the threat from the beginning. It's quite obvious that she's the one that's going to survive right from the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie seems very bleak and dreadful but in fact it has a very hopeful ending - if you treat danger and the unknown with respect and make sure you take every possible opportunity to get away from it, you will live.<br/><br/>What an obvious message! But it's so beautifully and simply told that you don't notice how obvious it is.<br/><br/>A simple tale told well is a hundred times better than a complex story told badly.<br/><br/>I wish Lindelof had a tenth of the storytelling ability of Alien's scriptwriters.<br/><br/>10 stars. As far as I'm concerned, this movie's perfect."

","From the very first scene to the very last this film both looks and sounds quite menacing. The design and the music are all superb and the performances, although a little chaotic at times are all excellent. Of course the stand-out performance comes from, the quite young at the time, Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. In a role she was to make her own she was a little raw, but you could see the quality there. Next up (for me) was Ian Holm as Ash; he played what must have been a difficult part very well. Yaphet Kotto as Parker and Harry Dean Stanton as Brett played the blue collar grunts very well, and also provided some much needed comic relief here and there. Tom Skerritt did OK as Dallas, although I felt it wasn't a particularly demanding role. Veronica Cartwright did a decent job as Lambert and John Hurt, who has one of the most iconic scenes in sci-fi film history, played it with great aplomb. Finally a word for Jones the ship's cat (uncredited) Some great cat acting from that kitty.<br/><br/>The film has quite a slow pace that slowly builds to an almost frenetic conclusion. I must admit that having seen the follow-up 'Aliens' (1986), directed by James Cameron, I lost a little of the love I had for this one. You'll be pleased to know I've grown up a bit since then and can now see the merits of both films. There is a certain quality to every scene in this film, whether it's the sound design, the music or just the sets themselves, it looks and sounds quite brilliant. It's creepy as hell and I believe Ridley Scott has learned the art of allowing the audience enough of a glimpse for them to make up the rest of the monster in their own minds. This is (of course) where all the best monsters lurk It's not perfect though, there are a few rough edges here and there, but even so well worth a look!...

Look at what this film actually created: 3 sequels, 2 unofficial ones and a prequel that's released in 10 days here in the UK.

","Entering a decade where John Carpenter's Halloween would take great influence, and leaving the past few decades of B-movie sci-fi monster flicks, Alien was astonishingly ahead of it's time in how it portrayed science fiction monsters in movies. Possessing special effects not only amazingly advanced, but inventively advanced as well, this film Impeccably utilizes the darkness of space and shadows to build a claustrophobic, dank, and heart-stoppingly terrifying vibe and atmosphere. Being as artistic in its minimal philosophic depth as much as it is in its design, Alien to this day is the most original take on the idea of monster movies, space movies, and science fiction movies in general. Giving an antagonist similar in appearance to Godzilla the tactics similar to those of Michael Myers, by shrinking the roaming scale of science fiction monster movies from a large city, to just around the corner in a hallway. It's incredible how this film could make something as wide and empty as space feel inescapably close and narrow, and that is still as shocking as ever to this day."

","A mining ship, investigating a suspected SOS, lands on a distant planet. The crew discovers some strange creatures and investigates.<br/><br/>I've finally got around to reviewing one of my favorite classic horror films, Alien. While films nowadays resort to recycling the same old movie over and over again, while managing to polish it with poor acting and no tension at all, Alien differs. It creates tension by using atmosphere. This is my favorite part of the film, because no other film can manage to do this without making it look trashy and also labeling itself as clichÃ©d and contrived. The atmosphere is moody, creepy, and also uses the slow pace to tell a story, while also crafting the characters through their development. The score blurs in the background, and especially in one scene where all you hear is someones heartbeat. The question to ask yourself who's heartbeat is it? The aliens were creepy as hell, and the atmosphere also creates a creepy feeling to it too. It's no Exorcist, but the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat waiting for the next attack, which never comes across predictable. Now with all that out of the way, this movie is a classic. There's no doubt about it, the movie creates a perfect feeling throughout and you'll never know what's coming next. The characters emotions are real, and the movie feels like it has sucked you into it's world and has made you one of the characters going through all the terror the characters experience. With the terrifying atmosphere, the moody score, the realistic acting, the wonderful special effects which never use CGI, and the eeriness, Alien comes out to be one of my favorite classic horror films.<br/><br/>Should you see it? YES. Even if your not a fan of science-fiction, the movie never slows down it's pace. Even during the first thirty minutes, when mostly nothing is going on, the film stirs up a creepy feeling and never lets go. If your a fan of horror, this will surely become one of your favorite. And bottom-line, see it. It's a classic, and still holds it's power today. In space no one can hear you scream; on Earth we hear every bit of it. <br/><br/>10/10."
"corey-porter","10","1","3","30 March 2012"," Horror Classic!
","Alien blends science fiction and horror creating one of the finest of both genres. It's design is fabulously shot creating a claustophobic atmosphere of pure tension. The opening silence is eerily felt. The films pace is deliberate building up to a blow out ending. The cast seem like they walked out of Harry's bar and grill. That's a good thing! Siqourney Weaver is oh so sexy. Her strong jaw has the strength of ten aliens and when it drops ever so slightly we know humankind will win the war.<br/><br/>Alien plays out like a mystery. Like Agatha Christie's ""And Then there Were None."" It's formula is simple: One by one until there are none. The script is simple and could have been turned into a disaster but clever and shrewd minds were at play. H.G. Giger's Alien creation is scary. It had to be. It's concept has been mimic and overused and has landed in Hollywood's Greatest Creations.<br/><br/>The creation of Ashe and Ian Holmes performance must be placed in this category as well. It was one of the greatest plot twists in cinema history. Who knew? We knew he was odd but who thought the white milk was the essence? The Ripley/Ashe confrontation was frightening. The true enemy is the Earth Company. The true enemy is Politics and Business. We are all expendable. ""I say we take our chances in the shuttle and blow the G***D*** thing into space."""
"mfnmbessert-224-279128","8","1","3","1 March 2012"," Alien (1979)
","It seems to me almost criminal the fact that I went for nearly twenty years after 'Alien' was filmed before I even got around to watching it, especially when I remember the countless toys/action figures that were made when I was a kid, probably around the time the third movie came out? I don't know because I haven't gotten around to the sequels yet, but even just from watching 'Alien' it's quite clear to see how Ridley Scott set the scene for countless other films that this one would inspire. We don't even need to get into it, but this film can be felt most definitely in 'Independence Day', some of Cronenberg's shlock, 'Pandorum' perhaps as some people have been saying, although I'd say 'Pandorum' owes more to 'Resident Evil' than it does 'Alien', but we'll see.<br/><br/>To me, this comes off as kind of like the 'Jurassic Park' of it's time. Sure, the special effects are dated when you look hard enough, but most of the time it works well and the cinematographer doesn't let you focus enough on the creature to make it look fake at all. Before you even really know the plot, you know the plot because of the formula that the film follows in the sense that everyone is going to wind up dead, mutilated, maimed, eaten, burned, whatever. It's also nice to see Ian Holm as a young actor, and the special effects involving him were pretty decent I'd say. I can't wait until Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' is released, it is going to be like his 'Avatar' which we all know will be less friendly for the masses, and more dark and sinister. Scott is a brilliant director, and that is clear to me now really because even in 1979 he knew how to get it done right.<br/><br/>ALIEN ----- 8/10."

After that, an alien bursts out of his chest and the crew gets killed off one by one. When I saw this movie for the first time, it really scared the hell out of me. It has one of the best utilizations of science fiction and horror. It is not just the creature that is frightening, it is also the atmosphere and the tone of the movie that sends shivers running down your spine. It is also very claustrophobic.

"jackhamel1987","10","1","3","24 August 2011"," Jaws in Space
","Jaws in Space - that was how the writers initially pitched this to the producers in Hollywood. And, whilst that is an apt description in some respects, it doesn't do this film enough justice. <br/><br/>Alien took sci-fi and horror and gave them both a much needed shake. Before this, sci-fi and alien films had been a bit soft, a bit too hopeful. And most horrors had become a bit clinical in their execution, a bit predictable. Alien is neither of those things. It is a claustrophobic, brutal experience that will leave you sceptical as to whether anything nice waits for us in space, and if it's not nice what will we have to do to stop it. This is almost a horrific version of 2001: A Space Odyssey. <br/><br/>Alien starts, unsurprisingly, in the outer depths of space. A spaceship is travelling to earth with cargo, and the crew are in deep freeze. However, after the ship intercepts a signal, the crew are awoken and are ordered to investigate. Needless to say something pretty horrific is waiting for them. <br/><br/>This film is genuinely a masterpiece. Some people consider the James Cameron sequel to be superior, but I firmly believe that this is the better. <br/><br/>Firstly, this benefits from a mature cast with no Tom Cruise style actor. The cast is made of grounded, realistic actors. Tom Skerritt, a character actor, is Captain Dallas, who is in charge. He acts this with realism, with dignity. He's not a flashy actor, he's just an actor who plays it straight down the line. He is then backed up by other, fabulous character actors such as Yaphet Koto, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright and of course, John Hurt (in surely the best role). <br/><br/>We are also introduced to my personal favourite actress Sigourney Weaver, who even now is the only woman who can open and headline an action film. She acts the role of Ripley to perfection - a normal woman who's doesn't need a man to protect her and can hold her own, but is open to human emotions and is literally terrified. Weaver makes Ripley one of the best heroes because she's a scared woman with no choice but to fight. Also, it's a credit to the writers that the made action revolve around a realistic woman for a change. There's no relying on men, no 'girlie' crying or whatever. No hysterics. Ripley is a real, grounded woman who has to fight and is a match for any man on the ship. <br/><br/>Secondly, this Ridley Scott's direction is absolutely superb. Scott is a talented director, but sometimes he allows his directing to get in the way of a good story (Gladiator!!!). Not so with Alien. He makes this story a claustrophobic horror, that builds slowly at a constant, measured pace, then explodes to life (quite literally). From then on, it's a tight, horrific ride until the final climax which is pretty epic in its way. <br/><br/>Finally, this benefits from Jerry Goldsmith's best score. A score that is never over the top, doesn't give away the horror or the emotion, and is as measured as the acting and the directing. <br/><br/>One of the finest horrors, and one of the finest pieces of storytelling every made. The only tragedy is that its name has been soiled by the later sequels."
"dirkwildenborg","8","1","3","22 June 2011"," Alien (1979) - Somewhat Disappointed
","Alien is the sort of movie I should like, as in really like. There's something about the combination of science fiction with horror that is appealing to me. After getting the client-side stuff out of the way (plugging in earphones, turning up the volume, emptying my desk to put my legs on), I found myself ready for the experience.<br/><br/>So how did the experience turn out? I'm just going to drop in the middle of things. <br/><br/>We pick up things after the away team comes back to the Nostromo. <br/><br/>The screenwriter probably thought it would be weak of a plot if someone opened the bay doors because they felt sorry for the away team. After all, if the problem of the Alien on board the ship was caused by a side character feeling pity for a side character, that would not be terrifically compelling. Instead, a subplot was worked out where one of the crew were a robot working for the guys at home base, meant to bring back the Alien. There's a few problems I have with this. I'm going to list two. <br/><br/>First, the presence of another villain wasn't needed. A movie with a well-depicted villain like Alien should not require a sub-villain to get the story going. The Alien is interesting enough, and should have been able to represent everything malevolent. Second, the robot is just kind of far-fetched. How does this robot even work? It seems to have an intelligence of itself, but it's also controlled by home base. At least that's what the movie tells us. But it seems forced and ultimately never got me buying it. I mean did they know they would have a use for this robot from the start? Why didn't any of the crew know about the robot being on the ship? <br/><br/>The scene where Ripley is getting the ship ready for self-destruct is a beauty from a technical point of view. The cinematography offers fantastic lighting, ear-deafening sound effects and a fantastic claustrophobic atmosphere. What this scene misses, is the sense of Ripley being chased. There's just not much urgency, despite what the countdown tries to tell us. During her preparations she does meet the Alien, but it's an awkward scene, where it seems the writer didn't know how to create an interesting situation. The Alien's just standing there, clueless, and Ripley's gasping, panting and ultimately just moving away without a hitch. <br/><br/>Finally, this is exactly the problem with the movie's climax. Again we get to see the Alien in an awkward situation where the script doesn't seem to know how to make the face-off between protagonist and antagonist exciting or interesting. The solution to this scene leaves the viewer somewhat unsatisfied as a result. <br/><br/>The movie attempts to bring life to the rest of the crew and it seems like it's succeeding from the first few shots. We get crew members laughing, making intelligible comments and caring for each other. Eventually however, it leads to nothing because the script does not follow through. The seemingly clear-minded and trustworthy commander of the ship dies from poor decision making and he started making obviously bad decisions too early in the film with nothing to counterbalance that. As a result, we can't really care for the crew as they get slaughtered. <br/><br/>Generally, the Alien itself is cool, mostly. It's cool and interesting like a light saber. It's imaginative, there's some kind of fun to it, and all in all you just want to see it get used in the film. The problem I have with the Alien is that as Scott has interpreted it, it lacks too much traits to really be a valid villain. Conceptually, it can easily carry itself over into other films and merchandise and still be appealing and fun at first sight. But, in this movie, being the antagonist, it's critically lacking. It doesn't seem to be intelligent - it doesn't seem to really have a plan, apart from destroying whatever life-form it can get its claws on (except cats). We never get the feeling that it'll create a plan, or that it's making use of its instinct or its outstanding physical abilities. The crew just seems to make bad decisions and the Alien just seems to be in the right place at the right time, typically, which also takes away a lot of the immersion. <br/><br/>So while I would subscribe to the notion that the Alien is a cool concept and that its imaginativeness and attraction are there (regardless of what happens in this movie), it just falls short and has the movie lacking a villain that could have really carried the movie to greater heights. It's somewhat hard to describe the issue accurately, but even when compared to Freddy Krueger, who is able to haunt his victims in a variety of ways, or Predator, of which we really get a feel of the way it hunts tactically, what its limitations and physical traits are, and which we even get intimate with as we gaze with it through its thermal vision, the Alien can't inject that kind of perspective into the movie. I guess that's the main reason a few key scenes in this movie aren't that fulfilling.<br/><br/>Still, it's definitely not a bad movie. The cinematography is awesome at times. The brooding exterior shots of the imposing Nostromo have a great eeriness to them and add perfectly to the movie's tone. The shots of the away team exploring the Alien vessel offer some beautiful lighting and there's some great switching around of camera angles. The opening sequence is very methodical and pitch perfect. It sets the mood, it toys with the decor, it uses brilliant lighting; it's great. <br/><br/>All in all however, I'm disappointed, although it's still lightyears ahead of all the sequels."

","""Alien"" is set in the future, in deep space, on a ship called the NOSTROMO. We are introduced to the seven members of the ship's crew: Dallas, Lambert, Brett, Kane, Ash, Parker, and Lieutenant Ellen Ripley. Using the help of 'Mother,' a piece of technology that helps them guide the ship, the crew slowly makes their way back towards Earth. However, they stop the ship when they find another in the middle of space. There, they find a strange organism, an alien species that is far beyond their knowledge. But that's when the species escapes onto the NOSTROMO, infecting Kane, who gives birth to a baby alien that was bred inside of him. As the alien grows and runs amok, the crew is slowly killed off one by one, leaving Ripley. Can she save herself, destroy the organism, and find a way back home? <br/><br/>I'm usually not a big fan of movies about space monsters. ""Godzilla"" just doesn't do it for me. However, ""Alien"" is more than a monster movie. In fact, I don't think I can even consider it a sci-fi film. To me, it feels more like straight horror.<br/><br/>Scripted by Dan O'Bannon from a Ronald Shusett story, and directed by Ridley Scott, the film has a tremendous atmosphere. Knowing that you're stuck somewhere with no place to go lends an unbelievable sense of claustrophobia and tension to ""Alien."" <br/><br/>Also, you see much more of the monster towards the end of the movie. For most of the time that you're watching the movie, the alien is kept in the dark as it roams the ship. It could be anywhere at anytime, and it's smart. Actor Rider Strong of ""Cabin Fever"" says that ""it's much more frightening when something's intelligent and evil."" The monster in ""Alien"" is a prime example.<br/><br/>You also have an A-list cast, featuring Tom Skerritt as Dallas, Veronica Cartwright as Lambert, and John Hurt as Kane. But once the movie gets going, the real key to the film is Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. Her character knows when something's dangerous and should be left alone. But when nobody listens to her, and they all die, she takes control and she doesn't go down without a fight. Weaver perfectly portrays Ripley, and she has created an ideal heroine, like Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode of ""Halloween."" Ridley Scott directs the film with passion and dedication. He gives us all sorts of wonderful shots, some being shaky and raw, putting fear in the audience and setting a mood of unease. It's safe to say that Scott was the best choice for the job.<br/><br/>To this day, ""Alien"" holds up extremely well. It hasn't aged at all, and doesn't show signs of it happening either. The film is filled to the brim with heart-stopping suspense and truly shocking scares, especially the ending. Thanks to great direction, a very original story and screenplay, genuine tension, a classic gross-out moment, and the iconic performance of Sigourney Weaver, ""Alien"" is, was, and ever shall be a flawless definition of what a monster movie should be.

The crew find an unknown planet; they go there in hopes of finding iron ore. One of the men finds a room filled with mysterious eggs, he looks into one and suddenly a creature called a Facehugger clamps onto him.

Later when a guy finds the member Ripley's cat, the fully-grown alien comes up behind him and strikes him with it's inner-jaw. Ripley and the crew decide to hunt the alien down and kill it. The alien eventually kills the other crew members leaving only Ripley left.<br/><br/>Ripley, thinking that the alien is still on the self-destructing ship, get's into a smaller ship and flies into space as the main ship explodes in the distance.

","The rating I have given is purely because of the plot, excellent background score and the superb special effects.<br/><br/>That being said, let us move on.<br/><br/>The plot I have already explained in the title of the review. It is a basic encounter a new hostile-to-human species plot. That the species needs a human host to develop itself into a completely different form is simply genius. <br/><br/>Some the actors in the film look out of place, and I wonder why they had been cast. Yaphet Kotto, Harry Dean, Stanton Veronica Cartwright all are miserable choices. <br/><br/>Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm are the real stars of the film. <br/><br/>Plot The commercial towing spaceship Nostromo is on a return trip from Thedus to Earth, hauling a refinery and twenty million tons of mineral ore and carrying its seven-member crew in stasis. Upon receiving a transmission of unknown origin from a nearby planetoid, the ship's computer awakens the crew.[12] Acting on orders from their corporate employers, the crew detaches the Nostromo from the refinery and lands on the planetoid, resulting in some damage to the ship. Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Executive Officer Kane (John Hurt), and Navigator Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) set out to investigate the signal's source while Warrant Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Science Officer Ash (Ian Holm), and Engineers Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) stay behind to monitor their progress and make repairs.<br/><br/>Dallas, Kane, and Lambert discover that the signal is coming from a derelict alien spacecraft. Inside it they find the remains of a large alien creature whose ribs appear to have been exploded outward from the inside. Meanwhile, the Nostromo's computer partially deciphers the signal transmission, which Ripley determines to be some type of warning. Kane discovers a vast chamber containing numerous eggs, one of which releases a creature that attaches itself to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo, where Ash allows them inside against Ripley's orders to follow the ship's quarantine protocol. They unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. Eventually the creature detaches on its own and is found dead. With the ship repaired, the crew resume their trip back to Earth.<br/><br/>Kane awakens seemingly unharmed, but during a meal before re-entering stasis he begins to choke and convulse until an alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him and escaping into the ship. Lacking conventional weapons, the crew attempt to locate and capture the creature by fashioning motion trackers, electric prods, and flamethrowers. Brett follows the crew's cat into a large room where the now-fully-grown Alien attacks him and disappears with his body into the ship's air shafts. Dallas enters the shafts intending to force the Alien into an airlock where it can be expelled into space, but it ambushes him. Lambert implores the remaining crew members to escape in the ship's shuttle, but Ripley, now in command, explains that the shuttle will not support four people.<br/><br/>Accessing the ship's computer, Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to the Nostromo's corporate employers even at the expense of the crew. Ash attacks her, but Parker intervenes and decapitates him with a blow from a fire extinguisher, revealing Ash to be an android. Before Parker incinerates him, Ash predicts that the other crew members will not survive. The remaining three crew members plan to arm the Nostromo's self-destruct mechanism and escape in the shuttle, but Parker and Lambert are killed by the Alien while gathering the necessary supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads for the shuttle with the cat, but finds the Alien blocking her way. She unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct, then returns to find the Alien gone and narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes.<br/><br/>As she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers that the Alien is aboard the shuttle. She puts on a space suit and opens the hatch, causing explosive decompression which forces the Alien to the open doorway. She shoots it with a grappling gun which propels it out, but the gun is caught in the closing door, tethering the Alien to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl into one of the engines, but Ripley activates them and blasts the Alien into space. Ripley puts herself and the cat into stasis for the return trip to Earth.<br/><br/>In writing the script screenwriter Dan O'Bannon drew inspiration from the following films: The Thing from Another World (1951), Forbidden Planet (1956), and Planet of the Vampires (1965).<br/><br/>H.R Giger was recruited to work on all aspects of the Alien and its environment including the surface of the planetoid, the derelict spacecraft, and all four forms of the Alien from the egg to the adult.<br/><br/>Imitations: Contamination (1980), Inseminoid (1981) and Xtro (1982).<br/><br/>Conclusion: buy the ""Directors cut"" showing five minutes extra footage."

While exploring the planet, a three-member team of the crew discovers a derelict spaceship and a huge chamber inside it containing thousands of eggs. When a curious team member goes too near the egg the parasite inside the egg attacks him, rendering him unconscious. He is brought back aboard, the spaceship takes off. After a little while the parasite dies and his host wakes up seemingly unruffled. But other crew members are unaware of the living nightmare which is going to descend upon them when the alien creature planted inside its unfortunate host would emerge.<br/><br/>A lot of scenes in the film will give you goosebumps, such as the facehugger appearance, and the chestburster scene (which is spoofed in Spaceballs BTW).<br/><br/>Aliens had more action than the first, because there is more suspense and horror in the first. Not to mention the film has awesome special effects.<br/><br/>Alien is truly one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made (Other great sci-fi films: Aliens, Independence Day, Avatar, Transformers, Predator, Star Wars, Back to the Future, etc.) Alien gets 10 stars."

","This movie is my favorite monster movie. I have the 1979 cut on DVD and saw the 2003 cut in theaters.The premise of the movie should now be well known. This movie is very effectively directed by Ridley Scott. Sigourney Weaver gives a breakout performance in the now iconic role of Ripley. The effective supporting cast includes John Hurt as Kane who meets a nasty end in one the most iconic scenes in horror cinema. Also in the supporting cast is Ian Holm as Ash who is not what he seems as is revealed in a shocking twist.If you are an animal lover you will be glad to know that Jonesey the cat survives along with Ripley.If you're in the mood for a well made monster movie rent this movie then pop up some popcorn,sit back and enjoy Alien."

","When this movie first came out there was nothing like it. In the theater I was in people screamed when the alien popped out of John Hurt's abdomen. Then there was silence and then quiet laughing because everyone had just had the crap scared out of them. The same thing happened when the android lost his head. People screamed and then there was hushed laughing. It was quite a ride.<br/><br/>While driving home from the show I saw something up ahead in the road. I got right up to it before I realized it was a porcupine. I couldn't swerve because a car was in the lane next to me. Out of nowhere my girl friend screamed at the top of her lungs. I Jumped out of my skin and hit the critter. Her scream, I am sure was a result of the movie, she scared me as much as the movie. Weird night."

","It's a given that with the collaboration of Ridley Scott, Sigourney Weaver and a rare blend of sci-fi and horror that brilliance was always going to be the outcome. Unless the scripting was deceivably dim-witted but good enough to hoodwink the likes of the previously mentioned talent, not to mention all the other cast members on board, there was always success on the horizon.<br/><br/>Too known to be cult, too expensive to be a b-movie bombshell but it didn't drown in the stream of mainstream madness either. It's a film that has strong devotees, but a widespread reputation and overall loyalty. The obvious answer to how they swindled the box office success would be down to sheer talent and a ridiculously brilliant summary of the film all within the tagline.<br/><br/>But it's more the premise for the whole scenario. A shadow friendly monster killing people off one by one, hardly the excitable reaction one would receive when summarising true originality such as Memento to the board. But because of an isolated setting, in an isolated vehicle, the inevitable becomes the inconceivable and that is (arguably) why this sci-fi horror can still manage to scare.<br/><br/>Who on earth (or more accurately floating around space) wouldn't be scared of being trapped in a self destructing ship with a highly tactful, two mouthed carnivore on the loose? Asking yourself questions like this make you appreciate it is Ripley doing the running and sweating and not you.<br/><br/>And you'd think with the fact it's the most horror fitting idea, to ever be thrown around, it wouldn't make you any less concerned for her well being just because its become a contemporary formulae that been fiddled with all to often. As far as scaring goes, it surpasses the interesting but un-scary original Texas Chainsaw Massacre with flying colours. As for science fiction? Its not 2001: A Space Odyssey but lets face what is? A remarkable film that is both unique and not simultaneously."

"Brawl_666","10","1","3","2 October 2010"," what nightmares may come...
","Extraordinary sets, visuals and perfect pacing create a mood and tone that has perhaps not been achieved by any movie before or since. Scott is aware that the anticipation of fear is far more chilling than the actual fear itself, and this cardinal law defines his whole approach : Economy. We barely get a few glimpses of the creature, and even at the end we don't see it fully. The film's characters disregard good sense at every stage, and do everything to put themselves in harm's way for the benefit of the audience. The only thing that looks dated in this three-decade-old picture is the alien itself (although it is still a frightful beast). To miss the film's mind-boggling production design and photography would be a crime, even for those who dislike horror films (me!). The images of space owe their very existence to 2001. Alien is one of the earliest reminders of how revolutionary Kubrick's film was.<br/><br/>Unlike 2001, this film will never stand up to a rigorous scientific evaluation. Its no more than a haunted-house film set in space. It is intense, but not profound. The film's gritty and vivid atmosphere creates a degree of verisimilitude which makes it particularly frightening. I wont watch this again.<br/><br/>P.S. : Just about every sci-fi/art film has at least one bum line that I can see coming, and which makes me cringe. In Alien, you have Ash the robot mouthing the following pearls of wisdom : ""I admire its purity. A survivor - unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality."" Ugh ! Disgusting line. These facile notions of ""human nature"" persist to this day, meaning only that nobody really knows much about what we are."
"colebt33-780-179547","10","1","3","11 September 2010"," This is no ordinary monster movie, this is 'Alien'
","""In space, no one can hear you scream"" <br/><br/>What I would have given to be around when this first came out. I could just imagine the impact that this movie would have had on the people of the late 1970's. Because 'Alien' was a completely fresh idea at that time, no one had ever seen anything like it before, and that's probably one of the big reasons why it became such a success, both publicly and critically.<br/><br/>In 'Alien' we encounter a small crew of 7 humans on-board the huge space ship of the 'Nostromo', they are interrupted on their journey back to earth by a transmission from a unknown world. They go to investigate and come across a foreign ship wreck where they come into contact with the alien life-form that will seal their doom.<br/><br/>One of the things that made this story work out so well was the setting inside the space ship. The spaceship in itself plays a big role in creating the feel and suspense of the movie. The director puts you in this maze of long halls and enclosed corridors, so that when the Alien gets on-board it creates this amazingly tense atmosphere of claustrophobia, which also employs a dread of not being able to escape the terror that crawls through insides of the ship. You may wonder why they can't just kill the Alien and get it over with, but see that's another great thing about the setting of the movie, you can't kill it, because this organism has a unique defence mechanism, acid blood. If you take a blaster to this animal, then it's highly acidic blood will eat through the halt of the ship, sucking every life including the crew's into the dark infinite of space. <br/><br/>'Alien' is an incredibly well-thought through, well constructed movie. There is not a single flaw, not a single spit of doubt or questioning in this movie, completely one-hundred percent solid.<br/><br/>The Ridley Scott direction is pitch-perfect. You couldn't choose a better person to shoot this movie. He incorporates an equal complexion of sound and visuals with intelligent usage of lighting and camera angles while creating a very realistic look into a far-off futuristic world.<br/><br/>The acting is splendid, the characters are just like us, ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses, which allows you to connect with them and feel for their fears and losses.<br/><br/>H. R. Giger's Gothic artistry and scenery design is just as scary as the alien, maybe that's because it's hard to tell the difference between the two. The creature itself is pure genius. A ruthless, soul-less monster with no higher intentions than to continue with the next stage of it's life cycle. It has no facial characteristics, not even eyes, which I think is awesome because you can't see where it's looking or what it's thinking and how scary is that? <br/><br/>The mere title of Alien describes the movie perfectly. It's a noun, and an adjective, it's the feel and the theme of the movie.<br/><br/>Alien is a flawless masterpiece, an absolute triumph in the film making community. It has all the qualities of a perfect film. A great script, great production values, great acting and great directing. A GREAT MOVIE!"

","I walked out of the movie theatre in 1979 in awe of what I had just seen. Alien is the perfect antidote for the warm fuzzies that I had gotten from Star Wars.

By the time Brett is looking for Jonesy in the cargo bay, I was ready to jump out of my skin.

Also anticipating the death of a character is fun. Alien looks good. The costume is amazing in detail and the acting is perfect. Alien is slow to start but it's worth the wait. Now you are definitely wondering why Alien is not a perfect ten and that reason is the darkness. Alien is extremely dark. On my small T.V. I can barely see anything. Almost all of Alien is nearly pitch black. You need a pretty big T.V. to get a good visual experience. If you own a DVD player you should see alien as I gave it a nine out of ten so it is a movie to see."
"ian-433","9","1","3","23 June 2010"," Uniquely alien
","An austere, despairing vision that far from finding any wonder or beauty in space instead dares to find a universe of limitless horror. 'Alien' remains the ultimate fusion of the horror and sci-fi genres.<br/><br/>Its underlying fascination lies in its keynote title. No film has ever imagined anything as uniquly, unsettlingly 'alien' as this. Not just the monster itself - a parasitical predator that has fine-tuned Darwinian adaption to the ultimate in survival - but also the derelict spaceship which harbours the egg from which it springs, after waiting millennia in gestation. No one has ever bettered designer HR Giger's concept of complete non-human otherness.<br/><br/>This was only Ridley Scott's second feature. His highly acute visual style (developed after years as a leading director of UK commercials) brilliantly establishes mood. His direction of drama is detached, almost eavesdropped in snippets, not allowing the audience to get too close to the protagonists. It's an approach that keeps the narrative single-mindedly on track.<br/><br/>And the tone is relentlessly bleak. The Nostromo's crew inhabit a dehumanised industrial complex of a spacecraft with few concessions to comfort. Among them there seems to be little more than indifferent companionship. The planet they visit is a hellish world of ferocious storms, smothering vapour and barren terrain. Jerry Goldsmith's music is correspondingly sparse, almost grudging in conceding any high notes.<br/><br/>Everyone remembers John Hurt's famous stomach-churning demise. But perhaps the most telling shot in the film is the one of Jones, the ship's cat, peeking out from behind a corner as the Alien devours a victim, feline eyes glinting in wary fascination at a primal scene it can empathise more instinctively than its hapless companions..."

","Right from its' opening credits this movie grabs your' attention. The score, sets, and characters are as phenomenal as they are memorable. Written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, ""Alien,"" has become one of my all time favorites. Even today it still stand the test of time because of its' realism and originality. The sets are incredibly well made and could make ones' jaw drop, while the score is probably one of the most memorable of all time. However, the best part of the feature is the alien. Instead of sticking with the typical little green men we are confronted with something completely different. Something that's terrifying, and yet stunning at the same time. Unlike most of the horror/ thriller movies of our time, ""Alien,"" uses the less is more technique by showing less of the Alien. This allows our imaginations to run wild with our worst nightmares. By showing less of the creature director Ridley Scott makes it even more harrowing when the beast is finally shown in all its' terrifying might towards the climax of the movie. All in all it stands out as one of the greatest films ever made, period."
"gigan-92","10","1","3","24 March 2010"," A True Masterpiece
","This film may just be one of the greatest sci-fi spectacles of all time. I remember seeing it on sci-fi when I was around ten or eleven, and sure enough that night I was terrified under my covers afterwards, keeping my eyes peeled for aliens under my bed. Or in the closet for that matter. But there are some classics that truly never die, this definitely being one of them.For one thing, the cast is incredible, including Tom Skerritt (Dallas), Veronica Cartwright (Lambert), Harry Dean Santon (Brett) and other A-list actors. John Hurt is Kane, our first ""chestburster"" victim in the long line of many. And who can forget, the very sexy Sigourney Weaver as the unbreakable Ripley. Ridley Scott's directing gives off the sense of a horror flick but with far deeper characters and even takes us into another world that audiences will feel is real. I certainly felt so. Landing on the dark, seemingly lifeless, planet and the direlect spacecraft's interior, all beautifully rendered sets. Upon learning of the film's age, I was astounded at the SFX of a movie from 1979. People often remarked to this film as ""Jaws in outer space"", but let's be realistic here. This film far outdoes the shark puppet of Spielberg's. The creature designs are remarkably eery and somewhat sexual, H.R. Giger having done quite nicely here. The alien, no more than a class act man-in-a-suit with some KY jelly for drool, gives the impression of a terrifying monster that both fascinates and shocks. And to add it all, Jerry Goldsmith delivers a chilling score that seals the mood of this film just the way Ridley must have envisioned it. A true masterpiece, ""Alien"" will live on in even as the AVP films attempt to burn the 'Alien"" legacy to the ground."
"ryan-601-662752","9","1","3","2 March 2010"," A lost art classic
","In today's world of CGI blockbusters, you just don't get the grittiness that Scott presented us with anymore. From the cramped feel of most of the scenes, to the use of miniatures and low tech ways he delivers the tension. It is really sad that in today's world most movies still cannot touch Alien of even Aliens, 20 plus years on. I can still watch this movie over and over and pick up something new every time. I sometimes have to wonder if directors in the future may return to shooting movies in this manner and revive an old art form, just to be nostalgic. Or maybe one day when CGI is so good we can't tell between it and reality if they will apply an Alien type filter to there movies to finish it off. All you have to do is watch Avatar to see what I am talking about, don't get me wrong I loved Avatar and it goes without saying Jim Cameron is one of my favourite, for obvious reason. But there is still something fake in the implementation of CGI movies. Although I must admit Avatar to me was the first time since lets say Terminator 2 that the line became really blurred without having to keep reminding yourself it isn't CGI."

And I believe him. I knew about the creature, how it worked, how it looked, the ending of the movie, how many survived, yaddie yadda, but when I saw the movie I haven't been put in so much suspense until I saw the Blair Witch Project. The Xenomorph is a beautiful snake like specimen.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott gave a Gothic feel to the movie and the music made you feel as if you were there. It's form of suspense wasn't like most horror movies where you could say, ""Oh I would just do this, or that, because you know there are so many ways out of those situations."" You're set dead in space on a ship that is basically a labyrinth with a monster who is a mystery until the very end. Even during the peaceful scenes in the seemingly safe rooms your still at the edge of your seat, just waiting for it to come.<br/><br/>There has never ever, ever, been a science fiction character of any species that beats this one.<br/><br/>This has got to be the best movie of all time."

","The originator of the Alien film franchise has aged well for a science fiction horror tale. Ridley Scott's knack for making visually impressive films really shows and the world owes him and H. R. Giger for creating one of the most memorable monsters in film history.<br/><br/>Having said that, Scott's film has never been my favorite of the franchise. The opening is as impressively artistic as it is, regrettably, boring. The cast minus Ian Holm and Sigorney Weaver all lack the much needed element of personality and Scott's loose directorial approach makes the dialogue sound really indifferent. The intensity does begin to pick up after the first act but at no point do the actors really stand out in my view. Even John Hart only stands out because of the chest-burster scene.<br/><br/>The film however has enough memorable scares and moments that it does keep you entertained. However, in the areas of narrative, direction and pacing I feel this movie is the least powerful in the franchise."
"CSHaviland","10","1","3","1 August 2009"," Classic Gothic Horror
","Alien (by Ridley Scott), despite some opinions to the contrary, is an exceptional piece of film-making. It is, in fact, an icon of horror science fiction, better than anything of its kind until that date (1979). Bad films are ignored, and this portrait of character has been anything but ignored. It is therefore by popular opinion a significant and memorable work of Gothic horror. Those who disapprove of Alien are generally eager for action horror, and this is not an action horror. Aliens (by James Cameron) was an action horror - a very different kind of movie. Alien 3 was a Gothic horror once more, but not even comparable in quality as Ridley Scott's vision. Alien Resurrection was an action horror, but not even comparable in quality as James Cameron's vision. <br/><br/>If you are interested in the *aesthetic* use of film in this sub-genre, there are few movies that surpass this one. Prove me wrong."
"croutonsofdeath","9","1","3","11 June 2009"," Even 30 years later, Alien is still one of the best horror movies ever made.
","What can be said about Alien that makes it better than your average horror movie? Well, three things: Suspense, mystery, and atmosphere. Each of those elements work together brilliantly. There's a veil of mystery over every scene, which immerses you in the world and makes you curious about whats going on. The film relies on very taught suspense; sure, you can tell when someones going to be offed by the titular monster, but even then the scenes are directed in a way that makes you hold your breath before the Alien makes its appearance. Just like everything else, even the Alien has a strong veil of mystery. The creature has a complex biology that entices, and the director gives just enough of it to the audience before hiding the rest. A brilliant idea, truly, because it ensures people would go to the sequel, be it good or bad (And in this case, REALLY good, but you already knew that :P). Then there's the way the alien acts. No CG, No animatronics, its a man in the suit, yet its looming presence can be felt throughout the film and believed. This all creates the atmosphere, which is perfect for the film.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the movie can best be described by the films original tag line: ""In space, no one can hear you scream."" The film has a lonely, desolate, and hopeless feel, which makes you feel like a member of the ship yourself, dreading the second the feared Alien makes its appearance. Everything is executed so well.<br/><br/>What else can I say, really? If you haven't seen this movie, see it! You've had 30 years to do so, so go out and watch this classic!"
"screenman","8","1","3","8 June 2009"," Slightly Disappointing
","Originally watched to a packed audience at the cinema, I found the movie slightly disappointing after the book and the hype.<br/><br/>I have the first three on DVD (they're the only ones worth watching) and it is certainly true that this movie has withstood the test of time. It is eerie, horrifying, and extremely tense, with excellent sets and acting performances all round. There really is very little to fault.<br/><br/>I'm still a little sceptical about the huge (apparently gravitational) voids containing breathable atmospheres in the spaceship, yet with no obvious means of replenishment. I also find the contrasts of technology a little hokey. The grubby engine-room of the Nostromo more resembles a coal or diesel powered steamship, whereas Ian Holm's character 'Ash' is an android replicant so minutely realised as to pass muster for human to all but the minutest scrutiny. That lot just doesn't stack up.<br/><br/>I'm also sceptical about the absolute and exclusive trust everyone places in the medical officer. I would expect such a small, close-knit crew to take a much keener interest in the plight of one of their number, particularly considering his bizarre and horrific condition.<br/><br/>Still; get your head around that lot and it's a heavy-duty horror trip of the first water. You'll be hard-pressed to keep still in your seat during some of the more sinister moments. You'll likewise be as hard pressed to keep from laughing when Ash - literally - loses his head.<br/><br/>The whole plot was fully realised a few years later in its riveting sequel 'Aliens', and that continues to be the absolute business for me. Only Carpenter's 'The Thing' challenges for the crown.<br/><br/>If you ain't seen 'Alien' your horror movie education isn't complete. And you'll want a big screen and an equally big sound system to do things right.<br/><br/>Very Highly recommended. Pleasant dreams, now."

","I love this movie! It scared the living hell out of me when I was seven. I couldn't even read a horror-picture book at the library describing the movie without experiencing the gnawing sensation of fear creeping into my gut. This is one of the first films to come out firing on all cylinders, and man, it sure does hit it out of the park! For one thing, take the title, Alien, and apply it to any aspect of the film, including Ash and the titular antagonist. The cargo ship is a freaking nightmare of steampunk imagination and industrial irreverence gone wild. It's no wonder the crew sleeps through most of the voyage. Would you want to be awake and living in that thing? The music is also sinisterly effective; its sole purpose is to manipulate you into either a false sense of security or to accentuate the already obvious menace of the scene; otherwise, it isn't even there.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott and crew did an excellent job in recognizing that trying to portray computers in the future from a 1978 perspective was futile; rather, they kept it simple, included some flashing lights (because as we all see now, flashing lights are the future), and kept it cold, precise, and doing exactly as it was told.<br/><br/>As was Ash. His every action makes sense once his true purpose is revealed. And his words, describing the Alien as perfect, echoed by Bishop in the second film, are particularly significant; computers and insects have very little in common except for one thing; they do exactly what their environment implores them to do. It is no surprise that the only emotion the computer expresses is awe when it encounters an equally simple and effective entity.<br/><br/>The characters are not given the time to explain their motives or describe their characters; yet, their responses to their increasingly degrading situation flesh them out in a way that hours of dialog could not have possibly achieved, Ripley chief among them. Easily the least likable person at the moment of the the alien's entry onto the ship; she ends up becoming your only hope of rescue from this horrible situation; and her responses to each situation turn out to be the correct one; if her crew had listened to her from the beginning, they would all be alive.<br/><br/>The alien itself is also terrifying. Equally anthropomorphic and insectoid; easy to understand yet unstoppable in action; its motives are clear but its next move cannot be predicted; it is as Ash put it, a perfect organism.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a ride from beginning to end. It still scares me, and to this day remains my one and only benchmark in the genre of horror."

I am not bashing Japanese filmmakers in any way, but seriously, watch a Godzilla film and then watch Alien, and tell me you can't tell which is better.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is incredible in this movie. She is perfect as the bad-ass space heroin amongst a team of corrupt or otherwise incompetent crew-members. She got an Academy-Award nomination for the same role in the sequel, and even though I didn't notice any difference from the first movie, I still think she did a great job.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott kept a perfect balance of suspense, action, and horror in this film. Each kill took place in a dark corner of the ship and showed just enough of beast to keep the audience scared. A flash of the head here, a glimpse of the tail here, and then the unsuspected victim is lifted off the floor and into the rafters where he is silently dismembered and devoured.<br/><br/>The Alien itself, though you don't ever get a real good look at it until the end, was expertly designed by H. R. Giger. What's better than an acid-bleeding, two-mouthed humanoid lizard monster that can crawl through air ducts and across ceilings as quietly as a mouse. Nothing is the answer. The Alien was played by an African tribesman named Bolaji Bodejo, (those guys are deadly without alien makeup,) who was hired to display the creature's movements.<br/><br/>Alien started the science fiction/horror genre and remains the best of that genre to this day. Its induces in people a nostalgia for the earlier great sci-fi movies like Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and for earlier horror films like The Exorcist and Night of the Living Dead.

Yes, there are some special effects that look ridiculous by today's standards (chest-burster scene, anyone?) but are forgiven by the film's sense of realism, tight-pacing and bleak atmosphere. It helps, for starters, that most of the interactions between characters were improvised by the actors, further lending credibility to the film's grip on reality. Despite the fact that the plot unravels aboard a massive spacecraft, you buy it because the characters look and feel real (with several of the players being middle-aged) and because they fit into the environment so naturally. Sigourney Weaver, as Ripley, sticks out the most as our unorthodox (at the time) female lead, single-handedly giving birth to the strong but feminine hero and the Sarah Connors of the world. To further the impact, the steady hand of Ridley Scott allows the film to play out at a natural, albeit, dreadful pace. As the film counts the minutes, things only worsen for the Nostromos crew, stacking suspenseful stalking scenes with paranoia and a sense of impending doom, until its intense and rewarding conclusion.<br/><br/>""Alien"" is a slow-burner in every sense of the word, but thankfully, it never drags. Everything in the film sets up a payoff and the closer you pay attention and invest yourself in its happenings, the more rewarding it will be. You'll be wowed by the cinematography, the Jerry Goldsmith score that bubbles beneath the surface, the strong cast and the iconic and disturbing imagery of the Alien itself, as dreamed up by H.R. Giger. Over time, it's earned its high pedestal in the pop culture world and is worth revisiting time and time again. A true classic in every sense of the word."
"VerdantGreen","10","1","3","30 May 2009"," My Favourite Movie
","Alien well and truly is a landmark piece of cinema. In the late 70's, film goers had been shown aliens as friendly visitors from outer space, in films such as Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Nothing could prepare audiences for Alien. What is it that makes Alien scary? It's a combination of expert directing and set designing skills along side the spine-tingling atmosphere that Ridley Scott creates. The scenes on the alien planet are disturbing in a sense, the derelict has a dark and brooding atmosphere which plays to the audiences fear of the unknown.<br/><br/>The most memorable scene in the film by far is the chestburster scene. This scene had squeamish audience members puke in the aisles and some people never return to the movie because of that scene. The chestburster played to the universal fear of birth, something that deeply disturbed some viewers. After the chestburster, there is actually very little blood in the film. Ridley Scott uses the technique pioneered by John Carpenter in Halloween which is to show as little as possible and leave it to the viewer's imagination.<br/><br/>The alien is only on screen for a few moments in the film, but it makes one hell of an impression. The alien is well and truly alien, it could never be mistaken for a human and at no point during the film does the audience identify with the alien.<br/><br/>After years of debating on whether my favourite movie was either Alien or Jaws, I finally came to the realisation that it was Alien. This is without a doubt a film that will be remembered for a long time and not easily forgotten. I don't expect you to consider it you favourite movie, we all have different tastes. But at least appreciate this movie for what it is; a cinematic tour-de-force.<br/><br/>10/10 - Classic"

","Maybe not as powerful and surprising today because we've become used to that kind of film (becaused copied so many times) but back then it was very fresh and surely terrifying. The tempo is slow but it works in context and contributes to create suspense and intensify surprises. The atmosphere and visual design are great and still look fine in the 21st century (with a couple of exceptions: one being a particular ""head""). The premise of the film was like a B-movie but everything was done to make it a quality A-movie including the actors who play seriously without any ""camp"" factor. Sigourney Weaver, in her first movie role, created a standard for strong female heroes that was extremely rare in those days. The alien creature as designed by Giger was a stroke of nightmarish genius recognizable and memorable amongst all others. It was even more effective because it was glimpsed so quickly and infrequently. Alien and the sequel Aliens have influenced tons of films and video games afterwards, especially visually. It's certainly a classic in the sci-fi thriller genre and should be seen by everyone. How I wish I could have seen it back in its heyday, but then perhaps I would have been psychologically scarred forever by its chilling images ;-) <br/><br/>Rating: A strong 8 out of 10"

The Alien's ""coming out"" is one of the classic movie scenes of all time.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott does a great job directing the crew of the Nostromo which is really a tugboat taking a load of mineral ore from the outer reaches of space back to Earth. The Nostromo looks very much like a set from Kubrick's 2001.<br/><br/>A not so subtle subtext of this film is corporate greed.

It scared the hell outta me, especially that chestburster scene, the time where what was then left of the Nostromo crew (Ripley, Parker, and Lambert) find out that Ash was actually a robot, and those couple times when the alien popped out and let out that extra-loud shriek.<br/><br/>It was really scary stuff, but I didn't scream.<br/><br/>I read that people screamed, gasped, shrieked back in '79 when the film was first out. I give it two big thumbs up.<br/><br/>I'm a classics guy. I know lots of classic movies. They're one thing that I've brought myself up on, and when I compare classics like ""Alien"" to some of the movies I've seen these days, it's pretty hard to enjoy today's movies because most of the time I don't really think they're fun or innovative.

"HelloTexas11","10","1","3","11 November 2008"," an incredible film
","I've lost track of how many times I've seen 'Alien.' Let's just say, a bunch. I never saw it in the theater, which I suppose is my one big regret in life. The first time I watched it was from a bootleg video print someone loaned me not long after the film came out. I remember standing in one spot in front of the TV, not moving for two hours until it was over. I didn't even realize I was standing the whole time. So yes, this is one of my all-time favorite movies, definitely in my personal top ten. Have the repeated viewings over the years diminished its appeal to me? Only slightly, if at all. I STILL see things in 'Alien' when I watch it now that I've never noticed before. This is Ridley Scott's masterwork and try as they might, none of the film's imitators have managed to duplicate its aura of silent menace and genuinely disturbing creepiness. While 'Alien' draws its inspiration from several earlier films and books, the way it merges them all together seems completely original. H.R. Giger's bizarre painting are of course a crucial component. The alien itself is wet, slimy, feral; it's as though the crew is trapped with an insane, rabid, murderous animal that they never get a good look at (and neither do we, until the very end.) Everything about it ties into our worst primal fears; of suffocating, of having something grow inside us, of being ripped apart, literally. All of this works beautifully in juxtaposition with the crew of the infected ship. They are not explorers, they are workers, as ordinary as any group you might find toiling at an industrial plant or oil refinery. They are tough in a weathered sort of way but not heroic in the typical sense. Through no fault of their own, the group never really understands what they're up against. To them, the common thought seems to be, ""this thing can't be THAT hard to get rid of,"" a defensive kind of self-delusion to stave off the increasing sense of fear and desperation as their number dwindles one by one. The characters all come across as very human, each with strong and weak points, and it's almost a game the audience plays trying to figure out which one he or she would behave like in such circumstances. Would you be stoic, like Dallas? Angry, like Parker? Scared witless, like Lambert? Or would you have the wherewithal to hold up till the end and somehow kill the alien, like Ripley? One can't help but get sucked into 'Alien' that way; it gets inside you and stays with you, long after the final images have faded from the screen."
"kenjha","9","1","3","1 November 2008"," Suspenseful, Old-Fashioned Thriller
","A strange being gets on board a spaceship and starts knocking off the crew one by one. This is an old-fashioned thriller along the lines of ""And Then There were None,"" except that the creepy mansion has been replaced by a futuristic spaceship. It starts off rather slow, but kicks into overdrive once the alien gets on board. The creature's entrance is one of the most startling scenes in horror film history. In only his second feature film, Scott's direction is superb, extracting every ounce of suspense from the situation. Weaver gives a star-making performance as the tough but feminine and sexy Ripley. The supporting cast is fine, particularly Skerritt, Cartwright, and Kotto."
"Jacques98","10","1","3","4 September 2008"," Really, what can I say? It's perfect. That's all.
","When I first watched Alien I simply did not have the attention span to sit through it. That's the same story as pretty much every one-star review you'll ever read. They, and likewise I when I first watched it, watch the first hour and realize nothing has happened and turn it off. I remember saying, ""Who can open up a movie in such a boring way?"" But after turning it off after the first hour, I came back later and finished it upand was amazed at the pure intensity of the last half hour. I didn't realize what I was supposed to realize in the first five minutes: everyone on this ship is already in a life-or-death situation. That is why it is called a survival horror movie. That's the pure genius of the slow opening. That's what I and all the people who think this movie is boring missed. Luckily, after finishing the last 30 minutes the first time I realized this and watched it again. And again.<br/><br/>The atmosphere and feelings of true desolation were a perfect execution of the brilliant tagline, and to this day I'm hard pressed to think of another movie that rivals Alien in pure doom atmosphere. But with doom always comes melodrama, and the casting and acting both diminish it.<br/><br/>Alien also succeeds in perfectly placing the two shock moments. It knows how to use them to their most effective potential, with flawless execution, by using the slow pace to deceive you. If you have not seen this movie or any of the spin-offs, do not let anyone ruin these moments for you.<br/><br/>But simply the main standing point that sets this movie apart from every other movie about aliens is the creature itself. In modern movies, creatures are thrown in with little thought or design, and Alien may be the single only creature film I've ever seen with a creature is not laughable in any way. Instead of stooping the stupid idea of making a humanoid alien that can talk, think, Alien defies the clichés by creating the most perfect instrument of death ever filmed, ever thought of, and has never yet been rivaled.<br/><br/>I don't what else there is for me to say. Alien is a true survival horror movie that not only started the sub-genre but puts all others in that sub-genre to shame. There are no pointless sex scenes to make you realize you're watching yet another tiresome, typical Hollywood horror movie. No pointless subplots or gimmicky action scenes. Alien is true, simple terror that copies real life rather than copy other movies to make money."
"michalis-kakouris","9","1","3","26 August 2008"," Not a 10 but very very close
","I agree in general. I cannot say it is the best movie ever but certainly in my opinion one of the top. The problem of rating this and other older movies is the fact,that most people tend to compare it with contemporary film making. This is totally wrong. When we saw Alien i was a student in England in my teens. People were leaving the theaters scared to death!!!We never had a similar experience in the past. It was the scariest movie we have seeing up to that time. It's being copied ever since thousand of times, but never surpassed even by Aliens, which also is a very good movie, an action thriller and not a sci-fi as this original. The creature is also the meanest, ugliest, scariest and perfect alien ever designed. It is the perfect killing machine, and this what makes the film so interesting. The humans are helpless when confronting it, and although technology has advanced they are still very weak compared to it. I think that if there is a moral issue coming from Alien is that we have to be humble no matter how much we advance scientifically. Alien is the punishment for our arrogance, an arrogance which is obvious in the early stages of the movie. I would give it a 9."
"talyseon","10","1","3","20 April 2008"," The Scariest Movie of All Time!
","Alien (1979) Directed by Ridley Scott, Written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett<br/><br/>When the commercial ship Nostromo receives a signal produced by intelligent life, it drops out of it's flight path and awakens it's crew from hibernation. The signal is from an alien craft, and by law, must be investigated. The seven man crew of the Nostromo land and investigate, Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt) in the lead. They find an alien, dead, fossilized, its chest burst from the inside out. Down in the lower decks they find thousands of eggs. When the first officer, Kane (John Hurt) gets to close to one, it blooms open, and something launches itself at him, hugging his face, eating its way through his space suit to get at him. They rush back to the ship. Third officer, Ellen Ripley (Sigorney Weaver) is reluctant to let them back in, wanting to quarantine Kane. The Science officer Ash (Ian Holm) lets them back in.<br/><br/>While Kane lies in sickbay, the creature attached to his face, the rest prepare to run for home. Ash discovers the creature has a defense mechanism. Dallas: (looks at a pen being dissolved by alien's body fluid) I haven't seen anything like that except, uh, molecular acid. Brett: It must be using it for blood. Parker: It's got a wonderful defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it.<br/><br/>Then, as suddenly as it attached itself, it lets go. And shortly thereafter Kane wakes up. It seems all is right with the worldbut we all know that is not so.<br/><br/>When the Alien hatches, its very much letting the genie out of the bottle, and the rest of the movie is a spine tingling game of Cat and Mouse, with the roles being exchanged without prior notice.<br/><br/>There are several factors that make this film a classic. First, it has many of the elements of horror; isolation. It does not get much more isolated than a space ship in the outer reaches. This also means there are very few options of where to go. Mood is another factor. The Nostromo is an interesting mix of very bright almost sterile environments, the crew areas, that remind me powerfully of hospitals. (That's uneasy making right there.) The rest of the ship is dark, industrial, and grungy. There are a thousand turns and cubbies, providing a million hidey holes and convenient shadowy areas. They seem to have a number of leaks providing internal rain. Another element is the group of people; they are not a cohesive unit. They are seven people, who have jobs that have thrown them together. They are incredibly believable; Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) are the engineers; they are the hands on fix it men. Brett is probably the one you page for ""clean up in cargo bay 2"". And they are very much two blue collar guys in space; their primary concern in life is how to buck around to get a full share of the bonus each instead of the half share they signed on for. People complain about food. They are rude in an impersonal sort of way. Lambert: I can't see a goddamn thing. Kane: Quit griping. Lambert: I like griping. They are very human, and very recognizable. Therefore we can identify with them, and their terror becomes our terror.<br/><br/>Further, Ridley Scott has a great understanding of Less is More. You do not see the monster full on. You see parts, briefly. You see shadows. You do not see buckets of blood. You see an attack, full of motion and shadows, and it cuts away.<br/><br/>Further, the pacing is wonderful. The first part of the movie moves with the stately grace of the Nostromo gliding through space. Nothing much hurries, until the Alien's emergence, and then everything from that point forward is a frantic rush. If any thing slows down, the scene is fraught with tension and frustration.<br/><br/>The music also works to build the mood. It is frequently absent. The life of a cargo space truck crew man is not glamorous enough for a sound track. But when the music starts, you pay attention, because something is going to happen. It is very much the Alfred Hitchcock method. ""I am going to scare you. I am just not going to tell you WHEN.<br/><br/>The acting is first rate. At the time, almost all of these actors were unknown. Now, they are all successful to one degree or another. This movie launched Sigorney Weaver's career, and Victoria Cartwright was nominated for best supporting actress. In point of fact, Victoria had read for the part of Ripley, and it was not until the first day of shooting that she learned she was playing Lambert.<br/><br/>One thing that made the acting so very real is that only John Hurt new exactly what was going to happen in his famous death scene. So when the cameras rolled, four of them, they captured the scene in one take. Victoria certainly did not know she was getting a mouth full of fake blood!<br/><br/>This movie won the Oscar for Best Effects, and was nominated for Best Art and Set Direction. Victoria Cartwright won the Saturn for Best Supporting Actress, and Ridley Scott took it for Best Director. The movie won the Saturn that year, and the Hugo of course. There are six other wins and seventeen nominations.<br/><br/>Further, this is one of the most influential horror films of all time, and the first to open up the concept of the female action hero.<br/><br/>On a personal note, this movie scared the bejeezus out of me. That is not easy to do. It gets my number one vote as best horror movie of all time."
"michael_cinefile","10","1","3","12 November 2007"," An excellent horror in space film...
","Director Ridley Scott (of Gladiator, Thelma & Louise fame) has crafted this claustrophobic, tense and stunningly acted science fiction film that cleverly combines elements of horror. In fact, it's quite similar to a haunted house film, only set out of space and a spaceship being the substitute for a house.<br/><br/>The film's memorable tag line, ""In space, no one can hear you scream"", promised a far different experience than the popcorn entertainment of Star Wars or the kinder, gentler saga of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. In fact, Alien was as much horror as it was science fiction. In fact, one could make a convincing argument that there is more synergy between this picture and John Carpenter's Halloween than between Alien and any of the other umpteen sci-fi movies invading movie theaters at the time. Alien is about shocks and chills and thrills, not space battles. Where Star Wars has light sabers and blasters, Alien has intense atmosphere.<br/><br/>In many ways, Alien was the first of a kind. True - it wasn't the first space movie to feature a homicidal monster, nor was it the first time a group of characters were hunted down one-by-one in dark, dank spaces. However, this ""haunted house in space"" film was one of the first to effectively cross-pollinate these two genres. Alien became the blueprint for dozens of rip-offs and three sequels. With one exception (James Cameron's superior Aliens, which substituted all-out action for creepy horror), none has come close to what the filmmakers attained with the 1979 feature.<br/><br/>The director of Alien is British-born Ridley Scott, who was stepping behind the camera for only the second time (his feature debut was 1977's The Duellists). Along with 1982's Blade Runner, Alien cemented Scott as a filmmaker of great promise and ability. These days, whenever the director releases a new film, reviewers will inevitably mention Alien, Blade Runner, or both somewhere within the text of their write-up.<br/><br/>In addition to blending graphic horror with science fiction, Alien has another distinction - it is one of the first films to feature a female action hero. Even today, on those rare occasions when a woman takes the lead in an action/adventure movie, she is typically measured up to Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley. In actuality, much of Ripley's reputation is based on events in Aliens, where she strikes back against the creatures with a vengeance. In Alien, Ripley is essentially just one of several crew members - until the end, when she's the last one standing (not counting Jones the cat). Having Ripley as the hero of Alien is an interesting twist. In 1979, viewers automatically expected that role to be filled by Tom Skerritt - not only because he had top billing, but because he is a man.<br/><br/>Alien is a perfect example of a director gradually elevating the level of energy and anticipation in a motion picture. The way Scott meticulously raises the sense of menace and tension is worthy of Hitchcock. Like Steven Spielberg's great thriller Jaws, this atmosphere-soaked production relies on the viewer's imagination to enhance the alien's nightmarishness. Scott carefully restricts how much we see of the creature - there's enough to provide our minds with horrifying images, but not so much that the illusion is spoiled. It's interesting to note that a scene featuring a full view of the alien was removed from the final cut (that clip is available on the laserdisc and DVD special editions of the movie, for anyone interested in seeing it).<br/><br/>Alien contains a bucket load of genuine scares. These aren't mere ""boo"" moments, where something benign jumps out of the shadows accompanied by a loud noise and a musical crescendo, but legitimate shocks. The first occurs when the face-hugger leaps out of the egg and attaches itself to Kane. The second (and probably the most famous) is when the alien explodes through Kane's chest. Then, during the hunt for the alien, there are numerous others. In fact, the level of suspense during the film's final 30 minutes becomes almost unbearable. What started as a seemingly low-key motion picture turns into a real white-knuckler."
"XweAponX","10","1","3","30 September 2007"," Ridley Scott is the Perfect Director
","I have just watched the Directors Cut of this and enjoyed the commentary by Scott, Weaver, Skerrit, O'Bannon, Hurt, and others who were involved in the original production.<br/><br/>I saw this in 1979. In 1979 there were two movies to see that had something to do with monsters emerging out of ""Eggs"" - Prophecy and Alien. So, we had to pick, which monster movie to go see, and it was Alien, mostly on the basis of Rumour. We saw it twice in a row on consecutive nights. Needless to say, I took off my dinner jacket and watched the whole movie with one eye, so I could cover up my face. Now normally monster movies did not bother me that much except when I was very young.<br/><br/>Now I have to reach back to give my impressions, and those impressions are larger when seen on a huge curved screen- I think they had some kind of four-channel sound in that theatre, it was the first film I saw that had noises coming from behind me. That might have been set up special for that theatre, I do not think that was so common back then.<br/><br/>So, this film starts and there are these lines appearing on the screen, which resolve into the word Alien, while the credits roll underneath. Underneath this enigmatic hieroglyph, a very dark planet revolves, someplace we do NOT want to visit, an omen of bad things to come.<br/><br/>Then we are shown a space ship, which in design is mainly four oil derricks: But to the eye appears to be a dark Gothic Cathedral.<br/><br/>And the inside of the Nostromo is shown and we see all manner of corridor and dark rooms and machinery of all shapes and sizes. This is all the spoiler that you will get out of me.<br/><br/>And so was set up the first Gothic Horror Movie set in Space. The first Successful one at least... There was The Green Slime before, sort of the same premise.<br/><br/>This film perform all the basic Horror genre elements expected: The less you see, the more frightening it is. In Scott's case, it was not, how little or how much you see, but how fast that information can be flicked at you.<br/><br/>HR Giger created the perfect monster: And my impression of it was that this thing was partially mechanical and also that it could hide itself in plain view. Another of my assumptions was that this creature would assimilate qualities of the organism chosen as host. I had a whole list of things this creature would do, or could do. This based on the very few appearances and activities of the thing we see in the film.<br/><br/>When I drove home the first night I saw this in 1979, I was horrified but also fascinated with the qualities of the creature. I became obsessed with it, I drew it, what I could remember of it, in my notebooks, and when they came out with a toy figurine of the thing, I was first in line to buy it.<br/><br/>This original Alien, designed by Giger but given life by Scott, is the best of all of the creatures of this type in the 5-film franchise. It is bar none the best monster ever made up by demented minds like mine.<br/><br/>There is a serious, plodding pace set by Scott in this film. In modern horror films, the horror activity has a tendency to take place as quickly as possible: But in this one, we are set up from the first appearance of those Hieroglyphs at the beginning, to the point where we think we are safe (But we KNOW that something ominous will happen) and when it happens we are hit with a jackhammer: And I was not surprised to find out, when the famous scene was filmed, the cast themselves were reacting with real horror reactions.<br/><br/>If Scott had not done it that way, this film never would have worked in that crucial spot. And because of that, there is really no place for sequels of this film to go: But thanks to James Cameron, there was a direction to go: And so the horror of the original film grew into a fascination with the creature. As was Frankenstein to early Horror films, Alien to Modern Horror films.<br/><br/>I was pleased to hear Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott, when talking about this film, confirm all of my assumptions about this creature.<br/><br/>And this is what makes Scott the perfect director, at least for the film Alien: because what was in his mind, he put across into OUR minds.<br/><br/>And the most pleasing thing about that is he did it with mostly Practical Effects, simply executed, photographed and edited well.<br/><br/>When I see the modern depictions of this horrifying creature, sometimes they use CGI representations of it which do not convince me, even though I did enjoy the STORY of Aliens vs Predator, the Alien is remarkably cheap looking (IN the CGI shots): But I can forgive that, because the director of AvP BROUGHT BACK the Shiny Dome Head that HR Giger had so carefully designed to scare the s___ out of us. So when I see disappointments in the CGI... Because I know that there is really no excuse today for a CGI effect to be bad...<br/><br/>I know I can still flip the Directors Cut DVD into my player and catch that magic again."

But this tops it for sure. It features a bravo performance from the marvelous Sigourney Weaver, who plays our clever and strong female heroin.<br/><br/>What is so extraordinary is that the film is so psychologically effective its almost unflinching to watch.

"wellmaketime","8","1","3","5 August 2007"," ""In space, no one can hear you scream""
","A Gothic horror move set in outer space, ALIEN proved that material derided as B-movie fodder could be handled with finesse and glossy production values, without diminishing the thrills or polishing over the hard-edged horror.<br/><br/>The story is an amalgam of elements from older sci-fi flicks. The working class crew of the spaceship Nostromo (the name taken from the work of Joseph Conrad, whose story ""The Duel"" served as the basis for Scott's debut movie THE DUELISTS) encounter an unknown distress call that leads them to a primordial planet. This leads them to an investigation; in which a alien attatches it self to one of the crew members face and spreads when its removed. After all of the crew succumb to the aliens power, only one is left, bring in one of cinema's greatest heroes and sole survivor, Ellen Ripley, played fantastically by Sigourney Weaver.<br/><br/>The art direction, performances and visuals are amazing. It is easily one of Ridley Scott's greatest films, along with Gladiator. There is almost an unrelenting tension that puts other pretenders to the horror throne to shame, whether they are big-budget studio flicks like Jaws or low-budget exploitation shockers like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.<br/><br/>Alien is definitely one of the greatest horror/science fiction films ever crafted.

Have to say, it's hardly dated at all, and is still the daddy in terms of tension and considering how old it is now... really enjoyed it... and it has to be a 10/10 straight away. Acting is spot on, with some big names from the 70's... special effects are simply incredible... (especially for the day) and the haunting musci throughout keeps tension tip top and bristol fashion. The ending is great... you think it's all over, then it's not... which I love in films... and that ""scene"" with John Hurt it quite simply timeless without a doubt. Is it a classic? Of cause it is... it's changed the way films are made/produced etc and is still the benchmark by which all other Sci-Fi/Horror is judged. Long live Ridley... genius? 100% cert."
"Tom-91","10","1","3","18 July 2007"," An exemplar to future film makers
","If I were teaching a film class, and I wanted to put together a list of films that highlighted how to make a great film in various genres ..... this would be the one representing horror. After 28 years, as far as horror movies go, I feel only John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" has even approached the elegance of this Gothic masterpiece.<br/><br/>When a scientist uses the word ""elegant"", they usually mean in the most complimentary way possible that something is as complete and as simple as possible. That's what I mean here: while no detail appears to be overlooked, no attempt at adding ""more"" was made. True, this followed from the ""Star Wars"" look of the ""lived in"" future .... but there is a noirish grittiness that was not seen before in science fiction (and would be taken maybe even more extreme when Scott did ""Blade Runner"" a few years later. This film drips with darkness and despair in much the same way that the early scenes of the original ""Dracula"" did. As a fan of ""Star Trek"" which showed the world of tomorrow as hopeful, this was the anti-""Star Trek"": we're all screwed, you can't trust anyone, and the universe does have real monsters out there.<br/><br/>Another amazing thing to me is that after all this time, it is not dated. Sure, there are little things that will key you into its late 1970s origins, but they are for the most part small and easy to overlook.<br/><br/>This is one of the few films that I will watch about twice a year, and yet I never really get sick of it. Only in recent years have I finally gotten the nerve to watch it alone at night with the lights out. For people who have never seen this, and are not used to horror: get warmed up first. If you call yourself a horror fan, you are not a fan until you have seen this film."
"jzappa","10","1","3","6 July 2007"," A Masterpiece of Suspense
","Ridley Scott opens Alien in a completely foreign atmosphere, with detailed images and objects that we've never seen and detailed sound effects that we've never heard. The camera moves around slowly and quietly, exploring this place, and it makes us want to be there. This is how he elusively draws us in and begins building suspense right under our noses. The commercial spaceship, the distance it is away from earth that's impossible in this age and surely for another several decades, the planet the characters land on, and practically every means of doing ordinary things are all, well, alien to us, and we cannot help but feel bewildered and tense. The scenes of suspense are some of the most powerful I have ever seen. You cannot watch certain scenes in this film without being caused to jump. Ridley Scott is such a cognizant and clear-minded director that he has built the entire film around the seemingly incidental effects it has on us.<br/><br/>The story is original, and somehow very naturally disturbing. Everyone is away from home, everyone has a lifestyle that doesn't even exist in the present-day reality, the science-fiction creations are all twisted imaginings. The plot hardly takes any turns. It's actually rather simple, and yet every scene is unpredictable, the writing is truly scary, and literally everything is done right, right down to the handling of the character of Jonesy, the cat.<br/><br/>The creature itself is a disturbing, vivid creation. I mean, have you ever thought about how odd this thing is? It looks almost like a Frankenstein's monster of machinery and mechanical parts. When it is first seen, we hardly even realize that we've seen it. That is how scary this movie is."
"horrorfan1023","10","1","3","3 July 2007"," My favorite movie of all
","This was not the first movie in the series I saw (""Aliens"" was the first one I saw), but it is my favorite, in the series and out of all movies I've seen. ""Alien"" caused more scares than most of the other horror movies of the 70's and 80's. I cannot remember hearing about the other horror movie classics, such as ""Halloween"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", creating some of the reactions this one did right in the middle of the theater. It still scared me, even after I knew what I was in for after watching ""Aliens"" and ""Alien Resurrection,"" (facehuggers and chestbursters considered mind you). Not many movies can do that. Certainly not some of the classic slasher films could. This film is far better than ""Star Wars"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" It makes sense, it could possibly happen in the future, and it has an actual story to it, not just some people trapped in an area getting knocked off one-by-one (it didn't rip off Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians,"" thank you). The scene where Kane has the alien fetus burst out of his chest was probably the most visually disturbing moment in the whole movie. They never did that in ""Friday the 13th!"" ""Halloween"" never had a creature who had a second mouth that snapped out and bit chunks off of you. Freddy Krueger never bled acid for blood and laid an alien embryo inside your chest."
"arthera09","8","1","3","22 June 2007"," great movie, but I think over rated
","I liked this movie a lot and the production value was some of the best I have seen from a movie that old, but I was honestly disappointed in the whole feel of the movie. The best think I would say was the production value. There was little character development and the end was kind of anti-climatic. I would have liked to have seen the alien came after Ripley and have something a bit more exciting at the end besides the final jump at her. I really enjoyed the sound effects, but were used so much better in a Space Oddessy. I know I should not be comparing the two movies, but it happens. I have to say who ever was the production designer went well above and beyond. The cinematography was surprisingly rich considering the atmosphere. The one scene with Ripley coming down the later with the flame thrower was just great. The use of the strobe was nice and gave a sense of not knowing what the danger was. Ridley Scott really did create a whole new world with a lot of atmosphere and I look forward to seeing the next one again. I did not feel the suspense as much as I could have and the set of urgency was achieved at the end with the quick editing did not seem to pace well together. Oh one of my favorite things was how some of the shots were very dark and small and I wonder how another director with the current technology would imagine some of the shots. I have to give a lot of respect to Ridley Scott for doing a lot with a little (in terms of the current state of special effects)."
"penguinbw22","10","1","3","15 June 2007"," As close to perfection as humanly possible
","Horror movies are one of my favorite genres, being a teenager, I love the rush of suspense and the sight of gore. In general, however, there has never been a horror movie that can match the beauty of the 1979 flick, Alien. <br/><br/>Story- 10 The plot is not very exciting from the get go. Simply put, the crew of a transport spaceship goes to investigate an SOS signal from a remote planet. While searching, the crew finds an organic lifeform that attach itself to one members face. The crew member is brought back onto the ship, after which all hell breaks loose. Unlike most modern horror movies, Alien uses an enticing and strangely addictive plot to draw the audience into the movie. This in turn increases the scare factor, since the audience is able to feel as though they are on board the ship. The remote location was also revolutionary at the time, as it gives a feeling of no escape. Overall the plot was just executed perfectly. <br/><br/>Purpose- 10 Horror movies are meant to scare people and this movie, at least on first viewing, dos just that. For one, we are introduced to a horrifying creature that seems invincible. Byond that, this movie uses the perfect balance of blood and gore that I have ever seen in a horror movie. We cringe during the chesburster scene but we also experience shocking moments such as Dallas' death. At the end of the day, we walk away with a fear of the unknown, a fear of an all powerful creature that is impossible to stop. <br/><br/>Acting- 8 The acting wasn't quite perfect, but was able to get the job done and is above average for a horror movie. All of the actors seemed to fit the role of their character. Sigourney Weaver, in my opinion, is a little overrated and she seemed much too tough and determined for her character. At the same time, Veronica Cartwright was a little too emotional, effectively ruining her death scene. The acting didn't need to be great here, it did enough to get the job done. <br/><br/>Visuals- 10 They certainly aren't modern, but I love the design of the alien and also the vastness of the massive Nostromo. Once again, the blood wasn't overdone in this movie, even by 70's standards I'm sure for the time the spaceship was very realistic looking. The most important part, however, was the camera angles chosen, for example during the scene in which Brett looks for Jones the cat, and the depiction of isolation that set this movie apart from others. <br/><br/>Audio- 10 The soundtrack here is WAY underrated, it sets off just the right mood for the film. It also makes me smile to see how sound plays a large role in this film. It gives a cold feeling, for example, to hear the facehugger organism's slimy movements, or Lambert's death scene. It is a technique underutilized in horror films and should be rethought. <br/><br/>Overall 10/10 I wrote this review first because this is the model I will base other reviews off of. Everything done in this movie is to perfection and it is rare to see this type of execution on the big screen today. Today's directors really need to take a look back to this movie, hopefully they will be able to pull ideas out to create a solid horror film."

","Not the regular stuff pushed out by movie studios but a classic that will have you glued to your seat till the final moments have come to pass. A very stylish and unique shocker with the appropriate amount of claustrophobic and fear inducing moments that are cleverly injected at the most unexpected moments. Edge-of-your-seat moments galore as the crew of the Nostromo is pitted against something that none of them have come across before and the tension slowly but steadily builds and builds with certain parts stretched and twisted to breaking point leaving a delightful after taste in your mouth as the final moments come reeling down. A movie that toys with the inner depths of the mind cleverly juggling with Claustrophobia, Fear and Tension passing them around like a magician with his wand coming up with trick after trick. The creepy background score sending shivers down your spine creating an ambiance that will leave you with no breath to spare with its ever changing tone.<br/><br/>The entire cast gives superb performances through out but its Sigourney Weaver who takes the cake with a fluent performance as Ellen Ripley who, in the latter stages gives a performance that will keep you on your toes till the end. You will feel for each and every character mostly because of their brilliant on-screen chemistry and the tense atmosphere created by them.<br/><br/>A movie which will have you gasping for breath and feeling some what relieved when the final credits start rolling as you will have lived and breathed every second of it.

That's why the first wast the best it wasn't interested in creating horror but terror. Huge difference, horror is the gory stuff you see as an end result. Terror is inflicted in the mind. The film wasn't so much about horror as it was about the terror that comes with a creature that can't be reasoned with yet, it is as intelligent as humans. I'm amazed at intelligent movie goers claim not to like this film over the others. Yet, the others would not have a leg to stand on without this film.

","Alien<br/><br/>As a horror movie this film is the greatest horror film ever made and the 2nd scariest horror film ever made only to The Descent. Alien is the one of the closest they've ever come to making a perfect horror film. The film is nearly perfectly green across the board.<br/><br/>Plot: The plot is one that every horror fan knows. For those who are not horror fans let me just say that the plot is one of the most chilling plots ever conceived. For those who know a good plot you will love this movie.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting is one of this movie's strong points. Featuring Sigourney Weaver as Lieutenant Ellen Ripley she gives a performance only bested by her performance in Aliens(the 2nd one). Every other actor gives a great performance in this. This movie was the one that brought about the independent, charismatic women, and Sigourney Weaver was convincing as a leader.<br/><br/>Genre/Quality: As a horror film it is one of the scariest movies ever made. In my opinion only the Descent, The Thing, and Jaws are scarier yet this is better made than all but The Thing as a horror film. One great thing about this movie is that except for one scene(very gory) there is barely any blood at all. Just one very gory scene which is very well done at the same time. The atmosphere is terrifying. The now infamous tagline ""In Space No One Can Hear You Scream"" sums this film up perfectly. The thought of being stuck in a space ship with a hostile creature is terrifying. The creature itself is genius in nearly every way only beaten by the alien from The Thing and the predator. The alien does not strike in the open unless it has to. It waits and lures you into a dark space or duct and takes you.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this horror movie is only bested by The Thing as a horror film and is only 2nd to The Descent, The Thing, and Jaws in how scary it is. This film is a masterpiece and a must see for everyone.<br/><br/>10/10"

No other film compares to this and it should have won Oscars for S. Weaver. She was awesome and especially in Aliens. No other film that I have seen since compares to the fright and jump out of your seat as this film produced.

"matlefebvre20","9","1","3","12 April 2007"," Houston, we have a nightmare
","« In space, no-one can hear you scream » <br/><br/>That line has become so famous and it's the definite way to talk about ""Alien"". To be honest, I'm not the kind of guy who would openly show his feelings when watching a movie. I've never screamed while watching a movie and I didn't with ""Alien"" neither. But it doesn't necessarily mean that I wasn't scared.<br/><br/>Because I was.<br/><br/>""Alien"" is the definitive sci-fi-meets-horror flick. There had been a lot of B-movies produced in the first years of the Cold War which focused on terrifying monsters from outer space but they mostly failed to capture our terror. ""Alien"" does, and this is because of many reasons.<br/><br/>First, it's important to tell the synopsis. I'll be brief because this is a rather simple one. Somewhere in the future (when exactly, you ask? is it supposed to matter?), the Nostromo heads back to Earth after a mining expedition, somewhere (where exactly, you ask? same answer).<br/><br/>They arrive on an exotic planet where they receive an odd signal. They discover a huge... structure, where there's an odd pod containing odd eggs. Kane (John Hurt) wants to examine one of them, but before he could do any scientific comment, an odd creature (with tentacles) hugs to his head.<br/><br/>Kane is eventually brought back to the Nostromo. Bad move...<br/><br/>The most famous (and hideous) scene in the movie happens when the alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The remaining 90 minutes becomes a non-stop chase aboard the space ship in order to eradicate this extra-terrestrial 'serial killer'.<br/><br/>""Alien"" is both minimalist and naturalist. Minimalist because of the simple concept, the small number of characters (nine: the seven crew members, Jones the cat and the alien) and the small screen time of the thing itself. In fact, the alien is only portrayed when he's about to attack. When it's already too late... That approach is genius.<br/><br/>Naturalism now. Director Ridley Scott and his own crew members from the visual effects, decoration and make-up departments all own a great deal of reality in this sci-fi movie. The Nostromo is not shown as a toy and the crew is divided in classes, exactly like in a capitalistic system. This system is depicted in the way that it supposedly leads to the problems, which could give this movie a pro-socialist or pro-communist mood (you don't have to believe me, you know...).<br/><br/>The disgusting scenes of the face-hugging creature dissection, the alien escaping from Kane's chest and Ash (Ian Holm) being stalked are at the same time horrible and realistic, which gives even more power to the movie.<br/><br/>""Alien"" is also one of the first movies to have a strong woman as the heroine. Sigourney Weaver became a star with her portrayal of courageous and intelligent officer Ripley. And she rightfully owns that kind of reception. I loved Weaver's performance.<br/><br/>I also loved the special effects. The visual effect services are used for the famous and original title sequence and the 2001-inspired explosion of the Nostromo near the end. The silence which precedes the alien's attacks is almost a necessity in that kind of movie but it's used to perfection. It brings thrills when it needs to.<br/><br/>Many psychedelic followers would tell you that space is a dream place. ""Alien"" shows what happens when it becomes a nightmare.<br/><br/>""Alien"" is not only a great sci-fi movie, but it's also a terrifyingly good horror flick. The aspects of both genres are mixed at the point that none of them predominates over the other. And those who like only one of the genres won't be disappointed, even if they don't like the other part.<br/><br/>I just can't wait to show the movie to my sister. She isn't a sci-fi fan but I know that she likes horror flicks. I hope she'll love ""Alien"". But I have a pretty good feeling."

One of the eggs breaks and the creature in it takes possession of one of the crew members. They take him back to the Nostromo for medical researches but it's already to late, the Alien has found it's host.......... At the beginning of the movie everything seems very calm and harmless, until the Alien appears! From this point the movie starts a claustrophobic horror trip which takes your breath away. The most horrifying thing about Alien is, that the Nostromo-crew is just a simple commercial crew, so they are not armed well enough to face such dangerous creature. The concepts for the Alien by H.R Giger fit perfectly and the acting pretty good too. What else to say? 10 of 10 stars!"

The last scene I'm going to spoil is the final final one. Were Ripley blows the alien out the air lock of the ship. This film works so well because it doesn't have a big blob for an alien creature.

","For me,Ridley Scott has to be one of the most prolific directors of our time.Directing Alien to be the scariest film of 1979 brought the crowd something new.One that doesn't use antennas or blobs that ooze to move the people.But brings forth the raw power of terrible suffering at the hands or teeth of an alien creature that uses no remorse or mercy in the way it kills.The cast was fantastic in their portrayal of ore mining personnel turned re-con team to bring back an alien for their company to use as they see fit.But when the audience sees what and why the creature kills the way it does,it tells us that not all aliens kill alike.No ray guns,no blasters to disintegrate,but just sheer strength,and absolutely no feeling by the way it kills.Gory is the horror of life,in everyday things like accidents or mishaps resulting in loss of limbs or other,but here the creature does it for survival not realizing that its actions are by far from normal.But the result is total anarchy.Ridley Scott uses power combined with terror to give the audience a feeling of what if?,making them think i wonder what that feels like?especially by the alien using its teeth to rip apart a skull or chest.To us this is real classic horror at its best,and ridley scott knows how to deliver and give us the willies.Fantastic work."

The best parts have in no action. You don't see much blood and gore but you feel it! Alien 3 had a similar style, never understood why people didn't like it.

","This film preys on mankind's fears of the omnipotent female presence. There are queens, vaginal alien devices,the central computer is called ""Mother,"" and the thought of involuntary impregnation (face huggers), are all metaphorical vehicles on which the notion of power and death rely. This film is poetic, powerful and cinematic. Some feminists may disagree with me and say that my assessment is wrong, but what Scott is doing with all the female metaphors is simply re-instating the ultimate power of the life-giving (the queen laying eggs), life-sustaining (the drones impregnating their human hosts with their own alien species), and equally life-taking (they kill the host body they have used in order to lay their eggs), presence of the mother figure. Women are powerful. We have the capacity to give life or kill it, and this movie is an over simplification of this fact. Is this good? That depends on your point of view."

I remember back in the early 1990s when it was on home video, and I rented it with a few friends, and we watched it late at night for a Halloween get-together, and we all were terrified so much that we never went to sleep. To say that the sequel is better isn't fair. I thought the sequel was lacking in suspense. I did like this one though, even if I will never want to be that scared again. It scared me more than the Exorcist. I guess it was too realistic for me. I think the realism was so fantastic that it beats any other science fiction or horror movie to a big medium. That's how scared I was. But its a good film though, it really is."

","The movie was great!!!! The parts when the alien appeared out of nowhere made me jump and the parts where lots of blood were gross. I loved it. It is to bad that all but one person died because I wanted the captain to survive, but the alien put eggs in him so the survivor (Warrant Officer Ripley) had to kill everyone as in the end, everyone got eggs in them. I believe it must of been tough for her. She was very smart using a gas the alien didn't like against it to distract it long enough to open the shuttle door and suck it out into space. I have seen a scarier and more disgusting movie however. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a lot scarier and a lot more gross.

Her performance is great as a leading female character which was not common in 1979.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott uses unusual close ups to create tension and wide shots for the details of the spaceship. He also does not show the alien until the end to make the creature more mysterious and he manages to give more imagination to audience. In the movie visual effects are simple However, dark atmosphere and amazing design of the ship manage to build great tension of the movie. Entire movie was set in the spaceship. That creates claustrophobic feel to its audience. Famous chest bursting scene and secret of Ian Holmes my favorite parts in the movie. Alien has also very effective tag-line ""in space no one can hear you scream "" Alien is a masterpiece .the movie has excellent plot deep and moody atmosphere and amazing visuals.

"scootwhoman","10","1","3","8 December 2006"," Gothic horror in the future.
","When it first appeared, 'Alien' was a totally new look for science fiction. Ridley Scott turned away from the sparkling white of brand new space ships, and turned to what has been called 'blue collar space'. The spacecraft was grubby, well used, the crew relaxed and focused on their routine tasks. Routine, that is, if you happen to be part of a crew of a space tug, one which hauls huge processor barges across light year gulfs. To deal with the long mission times, the technique of 'hibernation' is used, which slows the body processes down to a faint thread, retarding the physical effects of the passage of time.<br/><br/>When the crew is awakened from hibernation by the ship's computer, lovingly referred to as 'Mother', they expect that they are at the end of another mission, about to see home again after years traveling the emptiness. But their voyage has been interrupted, because Mother has detected a signal, representing intelligent life. Protocol demands that it be investigated. I found it very easy to identify with the crew members as they contemplate landing on a strange planet, because they were just ordinary folks, not intrepid explorers, or trained troops.<br/><br/>What this crew finds on this primordial planet is a totally new concept in horror, one which crawls right inside of you. This film has a visual impact which altered the movie experience dramatically. The heartbeat in the audio track and the strobe lighting effects seen so often in todays films got their start in 'Alien'. But this movie does not need cheep effects to put you on the edge of your seat. Dan O'Bannon's story will do that quite well on its own."

It is a beautiful and uncomforting contrast, this coupled with the seemingly blue collaredness of the actors, it became easy for me to relate this to my parents and their friends, just people doing there job. What befalls them is an incredible foreign and never before encountered evil and predatory life force. With memorable scenes galore from this movie, its no surprised it turned 3 sequels, 4 if you include that outrageous AVP.Ay how this film defined what most horror movies of the legendary horror decade of the 80s. It set a new precedent of fear and accomplishment, using settings, camera angles, and decent acting and props, rather than just a man in a cape or some face paint and extra hair to scare the audience. Only a few films before this employed the deranged and bizarre concepts to scare rather than the what i call cheap scares, which is the scare achieved just for a temporary and quick jump or scream by the audience, those films all classics in their time and today include: Psycho (1960), Last House on The Left (1972), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Carnival of Souls (1962), Halloween (1978), Night of the Living Dead (1968), and Dawn of the Dead (1977)"

","Alien is a genius blend of science fiction and horror. As a matter of fact, it doesn't get much better than this. The plot is rather smart for a science fiction or horror movie, which adds to the realism of an other-worldly creature stalking our characters through the spaceship.<br/><br/>The creature effects and design are mind blowing and I'll never ever be able to figure out how creativity was so well used here. This movie, along with Aliens, serves as the godfather of modern fright. The scares are well crafted and performed and Sigorney Weaver is just excellent.<br/><br/>I highly suggest this movie to Horror Buffs, no matter what age. It's so wort the view, that it's impossible to hate this movie."
"cat-that-goes-by-himself","10","1","3","4 September 2006"," The archetype of horror
","I first saw alien when it reached France around 1980. I remember it was the firs movie displayed in Dolby surround in my little childhood town. I was underage and very proud of having sneaked my way unnoticed out of the queue at the theater entrance. I would regret this bitterly since my nights would be populated with nightmares from this movie for the few next months! We had no VHS copy at home so I had to wait 5 or 6 years to get a chance to view the movie again in Paris. I went alone and came up late, so I sat in the corner of a huge screen at the front row, seeing more the audience than part of a badly distorted picture. Despite all this, even though I had promised myself not to wink at any moment, I could not help but squeeze my eyes shut in key scenes like when the thing plops out of the egg or when the cat shrieks in terror.<br/><br/>This is to say I can't really give an objective review of the first movie that really scared me. However, and since I occasionally talked about a movie that had impressed me so much, a friend once made a remark about alien I was at first unable to acknowledge. After a dozen years or so I take this opportunity to give her credit and elaborate on her theory.<br/><br/>On the surface you get a lot of brilliant innovations (especially back in 1979), like ""realistic"" casual sci-fi universe, with basic, unglamorous workers as heroes. Something like that had never been shown back in 79 as far as I can tell. Add to this the brilliant special effects, gorgeous sets and costumes, (kind of) realistic looking computers and you already have enough eye candy to fill your average sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>But what really makes alien an exceptionally efficient movie is the simplicity of its underlying scheme, made even more potent by all the distractions that prevent us to get to the real point of the plot. <br/><br/>The creature is a part of us. It is forced into us while we sleep, then forgotten, and when it gets out of us it tears us apart. It knows us better than we know ourselves. Each time we think of a way of getting rid of it, it adapts and defeats our efforts easily. And of course the last thing we want is to see it. We'd rather blow 20 million tons of spacecraft than having to cohabit with it.<br/><br/>What better symbol for the basic mechanism of the basic neurosis within each of us? The symbol of our animal part, so well described by Ash (""I admire its purity [..] not hindered by ethics or remorse""), an incarnation of our own destructive tendencies we better die trying to suppress than acknowledge ever.<br/><br/>And what about ""mom"", the almighty computer? Is it not a perfect symbol for the rational part of our personality, the one forcing the cohabitation on us even if it means the collapse and annihilation of our individuality?<br/><br/>Honestly, being only an occasional watcher of the horror genre, I could not say how many movies came this close of illustrating (on a symbolic level of course) such strong and basic mechanisms. None in the major ones of the last 2 or 3 decades, I would say. But about the originality of the plot, of course it's possible to trace back similarities not only in 1950's B movies, but also in basic universal myths (like for instance the labyrinth and the minotaur, to name but one).<br/><br/>This is precisely the strength of the movie to treat us with a very plain and simple archetypal scheme, but cleverly disguise it so that we have the thrilling pleasure of feeling its full force without quite recognizing what we face.<br/><br/>All this may sound a bit far-fetched, but I think the good looks of the movie and the masterly direction are not enough to explain its success after more than 25 years.<br/><br/>Judging from the cynical reviews younger watchers have recently made, I would say the massive denial of the truly unsettling quality of this movies fuels this theory even more :).<br/><br/>This masterpiece deserves a 10/10, without the slightest hesitation."

","I am a huge fan of horror films, and when I go to see a horror film I have high expectations. Alien more than delivered these expectations. The beginning is very slow, but it helps build up to the main plot very well, and just adds on to the terror as the characters are also developed. The horror scenes are very scary as they can be unexpected as to where the creature is. Overall this movie was scary and could be disturbing for some as well. The acting done by Sigourney Weaver is very well done, although the rest of the cast doesn't really give an amazing performance. Sigourney Weaver's (or Ripley) terror seems convincing throughout the whole film. FOr a movie made in the 1970s, the special effects were very amazing, as if they were just bad special effects in this day and age. The alien was very well made and seemed real. This movie was one of the original horror movies that set the standards for all other horror movies in this era."

","Ridley Scott's Alien, is probably the most impressive Horror film I have seen to this date. It definitely holds its place among The Exorcist, The Shining, and other great classics. When I first picked up the title at my local Blockbuster, I had heard of it from other people and family, but just figured it would be another great slasher to watch with my girlfriend. So I checked it out and payed about $3.50 for a movie that I should have payed about $1,000 dollars to see. Little did I know that we were about to experience probably the best Horror film (and definitely the best Sci-Fi/Horror) ever made. By the time that the magical 117 minutes were over, we had been through the most stressful movie of our life, but at the end, there was a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>As I watched the film for the first time, I took into notice a few of the most prominent ideas and philosophies of the movie.<br/><br/>Alien tells the story of a crew of seven space ""truck drivers"". When they are awoken from their deep sleep they realize that they are not in our galaxy (they were on their way home to earth)and that ""Mother"" has startled them so they can investigate some type of signal on a remote planet. At this point in the film, the story feels very realistic and believable, because of the fact that there is no hokey ""magic"", or some type of destiny that one of the characters will fall into. These are ordinary people doing their job, and all they want to do is get it done with and be on their way home. This fatal trip to the remote planet will in the end be their undoing. Because the film feels believable and looks realistic, you have a better understanding of the characters and the movie all together.<br/><br/>One of the greatest challenges of creating the film, was designing and making the Alien. If it looked phony and stupid, the whole point of the film would be lost. This was probably the greatest of all the triumphs of the completed film. I am not going to go in detail of what this horrifying creature looks like so you will just have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>The maze-like corridors of the Nostromo make for a claustrophobic feel and this makes the movie all the more terrifying.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver's performance as Ripley in this film is probably the best in her entire career (along with ""Gorillas In The Mist""). Tom Skeritt is great as usual, and the rest of the acting is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Probably the most prominent philosophy used in the movie, is that within this crew, you as an audience, are facing your worst fears, no matter what they may be. You may be scared of the serial killer across the town, or the wild beast at the zoo. But nothing is more terrifying then the creature in the dark, that is never completely visible, that will grab you, and kill just because it wants to kill. This creature embodies every fear in your mind.<br/><br/>Alien was so close to becoming a stupid B monster film. With the help of talented writers, directors, actors, and others, it became the most popular thriller of our time. See for yourself."

","I first watched this film in 1983; due to my early age the viewing was heavily censored and I was instructed to retire to my bedroom after the scene in which Dallas announces that the remains of the face-hugger parasite will be taken to Earth for further studies. In 1985 I was allowed to view the film in its entirety, but remained in a state of shock after the arch-famous eclosion scene where Kane ""gives birth"" to the next stage of development of the Alien. It took yet another viewing for the full experience of the adult Alien hunting down the remaining members of the crew one by one, and the most pleasant surprise of seeing a female character (Ripley) turn the tables on the monster. Even as an adult I still shiver as an anxious Ripley traverses the cold and dark expanses of the Nostromo, on her way to secure supplies or activate/deactivate the ship's self-destruct mechanism, guessing by the movements in the shadows that the Alien is about to strike at any moment. Also, my stomach never fails to turn at the sight of the Alien torturing Lambert, or of the monster languidly stretching inside the escape pod, as if saying ""I'm not in a hurry for my next meal."" Finally, it is impossible to detest the inhuman scheme of the Weyland-Yutani Company and their android spy Ash: Crew expendable! Talk about human rights violations!"
"seedofbilly","10","1","3","12 July 2006"," Definitive Sci-fi horror
","The general consensus for horror culminated with science fiction now days is not a good one, in general when one is made it turns out badly, Chronicles of Riddick, AVP, resident evil, I could go on and on. I greatly respect all directors who willingly take on the challenge of creating any horror film, they're in my opinion some of the hardest types of film to pull off, generally they are either great or terrible, atmosphere is easy, whats hard is maintaining a solid plot to go around it, some films are in the middle, as it where, the hills have eyes and the new omen are prime examples, they are good attempts but I wouldn't rush to see them again. There is so much more to horror than being frightened, Alien wouldn't ever keep me awake at night, but I still think its a masterpiece. Another common mistake is just a total gore fest, those are fun, in a hideous way, but not generally good films, some are balanced, some go way to far and get away with it (evil dead) some go way to far and don't (Hostel). I know you might be thinking that those two films aren't so bad, but I only mentioned them because they weren't banned form viewing, I'm not even going to start about such things as driller killer and stuff you find in a psycho's apartment. And now we get to why Alien is the best film of its type, ever made. Because everything that horror should be came to together in the right way, the isolation, the build up to the aloneness, the betrayal, everything, one particularly good factor is the feeling of relief before the big crunch at the end, war of the worlds tried a similar tactic, but over did it a little, none the less, it works wonders. The production team were good (british of course) H.R. Giger provided some uniquely stylish and scary concepts and it spawn the chest-bursting scene which was 'one of the best scenes for sending the whole cinema into an uproar of all time' I agree with that, apparently people actually had to leave because it was that shocking, what amazes me is that in terms of plot twists Jame Cameroon was able to match it in shock factor in Aliens with the queen appearance, classic. Many people call alien one of the greatest science fiction films of all time, but I prefer to think if it in horror terms, it utilises science fiction to become one of the greatest films of all time."

Ridley Scott was the perfect director for this movie; his constant attention to the film's design and style truly made an awesome and eerie look. The acting is top-notch, especially from Weaver's leading female role. The alien itself is truly original ... and frightening (thanks to Giger's artwork).

"winged_loner","10","1","3","15 June 2006"," Alien(as in: totally strange) to many... total invader of safety to all
","Alien is quite possibly the most terrifying film to come out in the twentieth century, hands down. The most bizarre part of the film is also its most horrifying elliment; the chestburster scene. No one in 1979 expected that scene, and few ever predict it today. Rarely has a movie stretched beyond its original generation in this way. It is a very strange movie indeed. The plot itself is original in its own regard as a sci-fi. Then we get to the script (which is excellently paced and drawn-out), the characters (all having their own problems and weeknesses), and of course, the creature. Alien's creature is so memorable in so many ways that it is impossible for me to sleep without feeling a slight pain in my chest. Never before (and probably never again) has a movie ever made a person afraid of their own insides like Alien. Other films try to use outward scares... but Alien uses the imagination as its vecter... and it works flawlessly."
"John-redmond5","10","1","3","14 June 2006"," Which is the best one?
","Okay, first of all lets forget about Alien Resurrection and Alien V Predator. They don't count. I am talking about the first 3, the ones that really create discussion. Ridley Scott's horrifying, psychological but also very cold ,'Alien', James Cameron's exciting, tense, but also very dumb, 'Aliens', and David Fincher's interesting, experimental, but flawed and hardly scary at all, 'Alien 3'. First of all, why have I included Alien 3. Because it is different, enthralling and completely underrated. It is brilliantly edited (just look at the opening credits if you disagree with me), it has Sigourney Weaver's best performance of the 3 and the soundtrack is amazing. Then there's the first, Alien. Still horrifying, still amazing to look at and still inspiring Alien is still one hell of a film, age only slightly damaging it. But age has still has done a bit of damage. Its scares are not as scary, it's technology not as futuristic, and its special effects not as special. Yet it is still an amazing film. And then finally there's Aliens which is exciting, exhilarating and by far the most fun of the bunch. It also has the best variation on the Alien by far with the queen and stands as one of the greatest sequels ever. But age has been the least kind to this installment with 80's being written all over it. It also has the most annoying characters of the lot and it is the least disciplined one of the three deciding to take the least perfected route of three and decides to take a more conventional route of the three. But it sure is a lot of fun. So what is the best one? I'll let you decide."
"melwil","10","1","3","3 May 2006"," Gothic setting
","One of the reasons for the brilliance of the film, despite some of the silly, carping criticisms of it the Halliwell Film Guide, is that it creates and maintains throughout the Gothic features, although updated, which we find in many of the Gothic stories popular in the 18th and early 19th Centuries. Like many of them, 'Alien' is largely set in one location and the characters cannot escape from the other-wordly menace that threatens them. I consider it a masterpiece of the SF/Horror genre, and still, despite its many good challengers, the best. I first got interested in it years ago when I read a magazine article about Giger, the creator of the extraordinary 'artwork', including creatures, alive and dead, in the film. I read the book, saw the film, and for me, as for many since, 'the rest is history,' as they say."
"eamon-hennedy","10","1","3","2 May 2006"," A welcome slice of dark sci-fi.
","For me, Ridley Scott's Alien is one of the most perfect pieces of cinema, not only with regards to its genre, or genre hybridization, in this case sci-fi and horror, but also one of the finest films ever made. Unlike the fairy tale world of Star Wars (which I like I have to say), or the philosophical and mythological world of The Matrix (which I love, it is my favourite movie series I have to say), Alien is something of a rarity, a science fiction movie set in a world that is almost realistic and authentic. Of course the movie hinges of an extra terrestrial, a space ship, a strange planet and all manners of grisly deaths, but what makes the film so good is how the film feels real because director Ridley Scott and screenwriters Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shussett have set their thrill packed horror spectacular in a future world that feel real. Their main characters are not soldiers or quasi-religious figures, they are merely futuristic equivalents of truck drivers, carrying their cargo not from city to city but from planet to planet. It is this kind of creation of character and mise en scene within the film that gives it its charm, in a manner of speaking.<br/><br/>The way in which the story develops is also superb. What starts out as a film about a potential rescue mission for the main characters then turns into one about a medical emergency surrounding one of their own, in this case Kane played by John Hurt. The film then takes its twist and development into the film everyone knows and loves via its most famous scene at approximately the half way mark (that's almost sixty minutes in to a two hour movie), another superb piece of development as it allows the audience to get to like these characters before the violence and chaos begins. Of course when the chaos and violence do begins the film becomes one of the most thrilling ever produced, with its increasingly claustrophobic settings and the systematic killing of each one of its crew until only Weaver is the only woman left standing.<br/><br/>What I love most about the film is that coming at the end of the seventies (in this case 1979), the film is almost symbolic of everything that the American film industry had gone through throughout that decade artistically. The film has the science fiction leanings and fascination with technology and space travel that Hollywood was going through at that time with Star Wars, Close Encounters and even James Bond with Moonraker, but it also has that dark rawness that Hollywood had scene throughout the first six to seven years of that decade and witnessed in films like The French Connection, The Godfather and that other classic staple of the horror genre, The Exorcist. Like the latter movie, this is a film that, as I have said before, exhibits its plight of the fantastic and the horror inside a world that, while not as realistic as the one presented in Friedkin's film, is not that is possibly plausible.<br/><br/>Mention must go to Ridley Scott for his superb direction (his first mainstream Hollywood film) as well as all the actors (special mention must go, as always, to Weaver who truly deserved to become a big star after this movie) who in doing the movie gave us one of the most startling and most interesting movie series in mainstream Hollywood."

It is one of those rare movies that also has an even better sequel (""Aliens""), but it is still a fantastic stand-alone flick, too. Many of the other actors' characters are terrific, and the first little alien's ""entrance"" is one of the slickest effects I have ever seen--you could almost feel John Hurt's pain. (It is my understanding that the other actors in that scene weren't aware of exactly what was going to happen, so that their reactions could be filmed just as they occurred, and it was terrific.) Every character in this movie is believable and realistic; ""Alien"" really succeeds in every aspect.

","The 1970's were a dead decade, where it concerned the Science-Fiction cum Horror movie genre; we did have Sci-Fi movies that entertained as such, like 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Planet of the Apes franchise that started in '68 and continued well into the '70s. Then there was the heart warming Eco' friendly Silent Running from 1972. The year of the Science-Fiction movie and its quantum leap into mass subconscious was 1977, and the crossover movie of Star Wars. It was going to be the movie that now put Sci-Fi back on the moviegoers and makers map. Apart from Star Wars of course, other movies did their jobs respectively well, but in comparison, felt a little lukewarm and were not too taxing altogether as sci-fi movies. <br/><br/>As for horror, we had the battle for Good and Evil that was the 1973 classic The Exorcist, and 1974 had us running for cover from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. <br/><br/>All this was well and good, but this was until Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett came along, with an interesting new idea that in the end, no one was too bothered to play with. In fact, the only reason Alien got the green light was simply, and literally, that it was the nearest script on the table of a major 20th Century Fox money-man. They were so desperate to keep this new cash-cow of the Sci-Fi ball rolling, in the wake that was Star Wars, they said okay, it was quite simply, in the right place at the right time, and the rest is history. <br/><br/>Having the then newly British director Ridley Scott, his only role of directorship was two years hence, with The Duellists, perform the part was a very fortunate choice indeed. With an eye for microscopic detail, his perfectionist attitude toward realism and the grandiose of the Alien World around him, he and his team, has created one of the most astonishing and completely original sets seen in Sci-Fi Horror. The internals of the seven space truckers' ship, the Nostromo, has such fine and well structured detail that it is so very hard to remember that it is a life size model. This detailed work had never been seen on a grand scale as this, maybe it had with Star Wars and Space Odyssey, in a fashion, but not, remember, in a Sci-Fi Horror movie, this was setting the standards for future movies to aspire too, Alien was to open up a completely new genre itself. <br/><br/>Where as the Nostromo is minute and precise in detail, the planet in which the unlucky seven encounter, and particularly the alien spacecraft that unwittingly draws them in, is off immense size. To behold on the Silver Screen, with amazing perfection too, on this design, Alien not only draws you in, it also gives you, within a change of a single frame, a sharp in take of breath. Visually powerful stuff. <br/><br/>Alien starts of with a deliberately slow and meaningful character build up that draws us to each personality, in fact, we do not see anything of the Alien until the first hour of this movie. To witness their environment and the life that they have to endure while travelling across space has been done with a pace that delivers us a group of characters that we feel we have known for an age. We have to know who these unfortunate soles are; there is no rush here, for all individuals introduce themselves well enough for us to feel for their loss. <br/><br/>Alien turns full circle as the threat becomes more apparent, as each crew-member is slaughtered, the pace then becomes more frantic and chaotic. With the build up off visual suspense and the delivery of an atmosphere of extreme fear, Alien is on the point of no return, your anxiety has no where to channel itself, you too are on the roller coaster ride of fear that Alien has brought you. <br/><br/>You have seen nothing like this before, you're in shock, and if you survive the ride, you may not want to again.<br/><br/>Or just maybe"

","It is the mid 21st century. The commercial mining spacecraft Nostromo is on a return course for Earth with its crew in hyper-sleep when the ship's computer intercepts what appears to be an SOS from a desolate planet nearby. The crew is obligated to investigate the signal and lands their craft on the planet. About the time the search party sent onto the surface encounters a derelict alien spacecraft, the remaining crew aboard the Nostromo realizes that the signal is not an SOS, but a warning. But it is too late. One of the investigators comes across a hive colony of alien parasites, one of which puts him in a coma and attaches itself to his face. The unfortunate crewman is brought to the ships infirmary, where the creature eventually dies. Everything seems to be fine and the crew goes back to work. But this strange ordeal is only the beginningÂ… Sigourney Weaver stars as Ripley, the tough yet human female warrior that takes command and survives the horrors of the doomed spacecraft. Weaver provides all the emotion and realism needed to keep this film from turning into another cheesy alien flick. Although Ripley is not the obvious main character at the beginning of the film, she quickly becomes the center of attention as the crew is slowly picked off.<br/><br/>The alien itself, designed by dark sci-fi artist H.R. Giger, is absolutely terrifying. Gone are the corny days of little green men or blobs of goo or giant insects. Giger's alien is of a breed never even considered before in the nightmares of a child. The perfect organism whose structural perfection is matched only by its hostility. Only in the world of sci-fi horror are words like 'horrifying', 'terrible' and 'monstrous' considered compliments.<br/><br/>Jerry Goldsmith provides an excellent score that is only interrupted by strategically placed silence and static noise. The orchestral soundtrack immediately brings to mind the music from 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is an equally good example of the use of silence to build tension.<br/><br/>Alien is the absolute peak of director Ridley Scott's film career. Even after many views, Scott will make your knees knock and your heart pound in your throat. This is the sign of a great fright film. Scott follows a deceptive pattern of rising fear, false alarms and intense ""Boo!"" moments, rarely resorting to explicit gore to generate terror. On the outside, the genre may seem a bit overdone, but Alien proves to be far more than your average hostile space-creature film."

"Aditya_Gokhale","10","1","3","20 December 2005"," Terror like never before
","A movie like ""Alien"" comes once in a blue moon. It takes immense talent to make a creature flick and pull it off beautifully. Rarely are there any creature movies which don't have cheap, laughable effects or n-number of plot holes! ""Alien"" succeeds where countless other ""inspirations"" fail! ""Alien"" tells the story of a crew of 7 returning to earth in a mining ship Nostromo. They intercept a signal, possibly an S.O.S. from a distant planet and go on to investigate. What follows is a deadly journey of terror like never before.<br/><br/>""Alien"" has got some of the finest creature effects for the time 1979! The face-hugger and the scenes involving the face-hugger carry such shock value; it is surprising that the film-makers from later years who resort to cheap thrills in movies, haven't even been able to get close to showing anything to this effect! It is amazing how they have managed to make these effects look so good. The director is intelligent. He makes sure that the creature is never shown in its entirety. This trick works like magic, and it looks so real; thus, not for one moment does it seem as if there is a dummy running around in an Alien costume! Another selling point of ""Alien"" is the nail-biting suspense! The creature appears on screen for a minimal time, but the director makes sure the presence of the creature lurking around in the corners is felt! The set of the space-ship is so real, its scary! Kudos to the Production designers and set decorators.<br/><br/>Likewise, the lighting within the ship; it gives an authentic touch to the set and adds to the thrill-effects.<br/><br/>The sound effects are wonderful and very convincing! In summary, almost everything on the technical front deserves an A grade.<br/><br/>Now, the actors: All the characters are fully developed, and each one carries equal importance. That is very important in a movie that shows the involvement of a lot of characters. These characters are brilliantly portrayed by all of the actors involved: Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton; special mention of Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto and Veronica Cartwright. It is difficult to pick out any single performance as unconvincing. Everyone has done a fantastic job.<br/><br/>This is Ridley Scott's masterpiece. ""Alien"" will remain a landmark film in the Sci-fi-Horror-creature movies, and will always remain way on top of all other cheap imitations from the same genre."

But this time the audience wouldn't laugh. He decided to work on a script, he would once call Alien. After numerous re-writes the script was sent from producer to producer until one finally wanted to make the movie. After having talked to several (at the time) acknowledged and experienced directors without really having been impressed with either of their visions or ambitions with this movie, they finally offered the new comer Ridley Scott a chance at this movie. Although he really have not planned making a science fiction movie after his first movie, the period movie The Duellists, but although he accepted to take up the challenge. <br/><br/>Somewhere in the future, the cargo ship The Nostromo and its crew are heading home to earth after being on a work expedition. The suddenly get a distress signal from a ship on an unknown planet, and they decide to go down to investigate.

He is brought back to the ship for examinations. After some time he awakes from his coma, with no damage to see. But the situation isn't quite so easy. I will not reveal more of the plot here.

"brunopesteves","10","1","3","22 November 2005"," Best Sci-Fi movie ever
","As far as I'm concerned, this is the best Sci-Fi movie ever. I'm just a regular movies fan, with any technical expertise what so ever, my opinion is only based in my sensibility and emotions like any other people while watching a movie, enhanced with some trivia knowledge though.<br/><br/>What really fascinates me in Alien, as a Sci-Fi movie, is its realism. All the visuals and contexts are truly believable, and you actually look at it as a highly probable prospective of how mankind will be in the XXII century.<br/><br/>We can notice some aspects of the human nature that, unfortunately, will never cease to exist, like greed, latent conflicts in high pressure situations, corporative lack of scruples, even though evil is personalized on the robot Ash.<br/><br/>The settings are amazing as well, beginning with the spaceship, and its sense of realism becomes from its nature, a towing vehicle from a big corporation, a commercial vessel, not a scientific expedition with the purpose of exploring new worlds. Don't get me wrong, I'm a major Kubrick fan, I have almost all his movies on DVD, but 2001 is fascinating in a NASA point of view, and come on, it's 2005 and Man hasn't even got close to Mars, even less to Jupiter. 2001 is great for its visual beauty, almost poetic with the Strauss' waltzes, and it surely revolutionized the Sci-fi vision, but is far more dated than Alien.<br/><br/>So, regardless some devices, like computer terminals and navigation screens, that are slightly dated, all the rest of the props and sets are very well conceived, even for today's standards. Little details contribute to this, like the woodpecker figure on the mess table.<br/><br/>The main conclusion is that's not necessary a CGI overload to make a good Sci-Fi movie, and Alien is the proof of it. I'm sure if Alien was to be produced nowadays, certainly it would lose a great deal of its realism, that resides mainly in it's rawness, pace, darkness, humanity, and sets conception, that present Hollywood standards, and perhaps audience's demands, would suppress.<br/><br/>Just another remark: isn't it surprising that many of the #250 IMDb's top movies weren't acclaimed in their release years, especially by the Academy Awards? Alien is one of them. ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are great movies, still remembered, but ""Norma Rae"" or ""All That Jazz"" are hardly in Alien's league, as far as contributions to the cinema history are concerned."
"PsyGuy","10","1","3","21 November 2005"," One of the greatest, scariest movies of all time. Must be seen in widescreen.
","Alien is a sci-fi horror movie. By todays standards this movie might seem to start out a bit slow. First time viewers should understand that this is a part of the style that makes this movie stand out amongst the others in this genre. The movie takes its time setting itself up a a science fiction film. It doesn't presume that viewer will already understand things which have over time become standardized in these types of films. This gradual transition from science fiction to horror builds up a tension that the rapid paced editing and fast jumping plots of most modern movies can never hope to achieve. The overall effect you become familiar with the characters and drawn into the environment in which they live completely. By the time things happen, you care about the characters and can feel their fear and tension.<br/><br/>Some of the early scenes initially appear to be the standard attempts at creating a certain ""Wow"" factor in the viewer, such as the exterior shots of the ""Nostromo"" (the commercial mining vessel where the movie begins). This is actually far from the truth however. The way these scenes are developed, with the use of sound (or lack thereof) and music, serves to set a tone of bleak desolation and solitude. This hostile environment is truly what makes the situation the characters will have to endure even more desperate and terrifying. Their smaller craft detaches itself from the larger, making their level of comfort and safety appear ever smaller. With heir landing craft damaged during the decent, they land on a planet where the atmosphere is described as ""almost primordial"" in order to investigate an apparent distress signal. Three crew members finally brave the 2 kilometer trek to the signals origin. Trapped in the tiny self-contained environments of their suits, an untold distance from known civilization, these people are now as isolated as any person could ever imagine.<br/><br/>This then, is the setting for where the horror begins. The signal they have been diverted to investigate is coming from a derelict ship that seems to have crashed in this wasteland. As they approach, their transmissions to their waiting companions on the drop ship are slowly disrupted until they are no longer possible, further isolating them. When one of the three separates from the group to investigate another part of the ship, they discover something mankind has never encountered before, something completely alien, unexpectedly hostile, and frightening.<br/><br/>The entire movie is filmed in a manner that seems to make all of these imaginary locations look realistic and believable. The ships are claustrophobic and have a lived in look. The people are simply going about what initially seems to be routine business, oblivious to what is coming. Their surprise is ours as the events unfold. Their reactions are honest as they are completely unprepared for what is happening. Their fear is felt as slowly they begin to realize just how trapped and vulnerable they are when they begin to get an idea of what they are up against. The sound, lighting, and slowly panned visuals all serve to reinforce the setting and mood that has been created.<br/><br/>There's no need to delve any further into the substance of the plot. For those who have yet to witness this movie, I can only add that you are in for a treat. This is, without a doubt in my mind, the best movie of its type. Even after all these years since it was released, there is very little within it that doesn't still manage to look great. The director is to be commended on this awesome film, which has been referred by many, and accurately if I do say so, as a masterpiece. Please note that the only way to view this film is in its original aspect ratio whether you view the original theatrical release or the 2003 slightly altered version. I've watched many many films in both manners before, but none that lose so much in the transition to television. If you have not seen this film in widescreen, then you have not seen this film at all."

","Well here is where it all started back in 1979 with the Alien series, which some people have always found to be a bit hit and miss, many citing the third film as the weakest and the fourth film to be little more than a joke, but i find all the films to be quite simply stunning.<br/><br/>This is my favourite of the four films, introducing Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley as the main character, althoug she is not shown in the film as the main character until near the end, as all the cast have fairly large parts to play.<br/><br/>The plot been a space ship floating through space receives a distress call from a nearby planet, upon getting to the planet a few of the crew go and investigate it, one of them being Kane (John Hurt) who upon wandering this very dark place, finds an area that he stumbles into alone that has eggs in it. While examining the eggs one of the eggs opens and as Kane peers into the egg, a creature (what became known as a face hugger)leaps from the egg attaching itself to Kanes face. Other members of the crew find him and drag him back to the ship, whereupon Ripley refuses to let them in, due to quarantine restrictions after discovering the creature attached to Kanes face. The very odd medical/science officer Ash (Ian Holm) opens the doors for them to come in, they attempt to remove the creature but cant, which later falls off by itself and Kane seems fine.<br/><br/>The film moves sometimes at a snails pace but it builds the tension, as a few scenes later they are all sat at a table eating, when Kane suddenly starts a violent coughing fit, which suddenly appears to be very serious indeed, laid out on the table the others try and restrain him and try and make sure he can breathe, at this point major credit must go to John Hurt for his remarkable performance during this scene of presenting a suffocating expression with one of immense pain, while writhing about in agony on the table, at which point a small creature bursts straight through his chest, while it looks around with everyone stunned it runs off away and hides. Thus the first sighting of the actual Alien.<br/><br/>This is where the film suddenly kicks into action as the creature which had by now grown to gargantuan proportions stalks the crew eliminating them one by one, in the final altercation with the only survivor being Ripley who manages to escape on board an escape vessel after blowing up the main ship, the alien follows her on board and after a tense encounter is finally blown out of an airlock by Ripley.<br/><br/>This film i first saw when i was extremely young, and i would say it was the scariest film i've ever seen (perhaps The Shining more so now), the whole alien chest burst scene, the shocking revelation of what Ash actually is, the whole hunting down of the crew, ultra creepy film, which still looks good today."

","This film was by far better than all of subsequent followers. It dwarfs the others as a matter of fact and actually made the others easy to do. Become the film laid out a masterful template. Attempting to re-release this film today would be a huge mistake, the generation has no patience for the type of style and setting up of a story that this films delivers. They want action and explosions right out the gate. They want horror but this films delivers terror which is totally different from horror. Terror stalks you and haunts you until your nerves are completely shattered and then it resigns. Only to return just when you feel you have a grasp on what just happened. Horror on the other hand is the end result of what you found terrifying. The film plays so deep in the mind that it is hard to escape the images.<br/><br/>When the film first opens up with the shot of the ship. Like a haunted house, I felt like death had entered the ship and oddly enough the first person it touched was Kane. He was the first to be awakened by deaths hand. The soundtrack was perfect! The cast, perfect! I've watched this film so many times it would be embarrassing to say. I absolutely love this film for it didn't pretend to be like any other film. The idea that space had been conquered and people traveled through as casually as traveling to other parts of the country and then have something truly terrifying happen. It's like the ""Deliverance"" but in outer space, an easy trip turned into a nightmare.<br/><br/>There were so many great lines in this film, but one of my favorite is when Ripley asks Parker about how much time before the ship blows. ""How much time before the ship blows?"" ""Ten minutes!"" ""No bullshit?"" ""If we ain't got of here in ten minutes. We won't need no rocket to fly through space!"" Classic, dark humor in moments of complete despair."
"MinorityReporter","10","1","3","25 August 2005"," The Power of Atmosphere Triumphs
","I recently read a review here on IMDb and was astounded to hear that the reviewer thought this a mediocre film and I'm sorry to say that the people who do not find this a sci-fi horror classic are stupid and/or have no vision of what makes a good film. As I see it a good film is comprised of a few static elements.<br/><br/>First of all a good film is based on a good story and Alien has a very gripping albeit slow paced story that ultimately is as gripping as stories where the story is faster paced (e.g. Starwars). The story by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusset is innovative and as previously stated gripping and this combined with a brilliant flow makes the two hours the film lasts seem like much less. The story also contains one of the most memorable scenes in modern film history: the chest burster scene and the little twist with Ian Holm at the end of the movie is pure genius.<br/><br/>The second thing a good film needs is good acting and the acting in Alien is still top notch. Even though I'm not a big fan of Sigourney Weaver I admit that she does very well in this film and judging from her acting in this film its certainly understandable why she went on to become an icon in the movie business. Secondly we have Tom Skerrit also not one of my favorite actors but his sequence in the ventilation system truly shows the depth of his talent. He actually seems genuinely scared. The secondary characters played by Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright John Hurt and Yaphet Kotto also do very well. Of these especially John Hurt does very well. The best actor in the film and also one of the best actors ever is of course Ian Holm. The way he plays a android or robot is brilliant. His coolness throughout the film has actually been a clever sign of his robotic nature.<br/><br/>The directing is the third and final component of making a very good film. Ridley Scott really shows his talent in this early film and it is obvious to see why he has gone on to become such a prominent figure in the film world. The only film he has made that has bested this breathtaking experience is Blade Runner The way he directed the film gave it a look which the following Alien films tried to replicate but failed. He also succeeds in giving the film atmosphere through elaborate sets and decent effects both sound and visual.<br/><br/>Put all this in a mix together and you've got a master piece <br/><br/>9/10"
"ttornak","8","1","3","30 July 2005"," We live as we dream, alone
","*** SPOILERS ****<br/><br/>As in the original novel by Joseph Conrad (""NOSTROMO""), this classic movie illustrates the consequences of corporate greed in which human lives are of no consequence. This premise nor the story are very original, however the execution is almost perfect.<br/><br/>We start by seeing the ship ""Nostromo"" gliding through the cosmos, comfortable and steady. Later we'll see that image back and could be forgiven to think of it as an iron coffin. Hard, rectangular and final.<br/><br/>When we switch to the view inside the ship, the movie scores it's first major point. Gone are the metallic and plastic oddities from earlier sf-movies. Instead, we get a realistic or at least believable interior. The bridge looks like the cockpit from a large airliner with multiple seats, the corridors like the interior of a ultra-modern hospital. All of it has been used, there's nothing alien or 'plastic' about it.<br/><br/>All of this makes that the outstanding out-worldly design of the alien ship by H. R. Geiger is even more imposing. Circular and without a clear definition of what place is what. Even with the extra guest, you could imagine Dallas and Lambert being relieved to be back ""home"" after their disastrous visit.<br/><br/>The second point on which this movie scores is the characters. There's no search for one-liners here and everyone (even Ripley) has its minor faults. Everybody just does his/her job. They don't get too personal, they're at work, not at home. And yet all characters tell us something about the world outside of the ""Nostromo"". The news isn't that good. Not much has changed and reading between the lines you can hear each characters point of view. <br/><br/>As with the environment, the characters seem very natural and quite complex (except for the somewhat enthusiastic Kane), but this is understandable. To go into detail on all of them would take up a couple of pages. When one of them dies, it's not just a pawn that's been taken away, but a human being. The relations between the remaining members change.<br/><br/>Compared with later movies violence and gore aren't predominant in this movie. Instead there's fear. The alien is unknown, it behaves like nothing we know and it could strike wherever and whenever. And the director uses all the tricks he knows to keep the tension up. Just a few examples :<br/><br/>Brett taking the skin and realizing what he's holding. Dallas'crawl through the vent-duct. The countdown, copied a hundred times, never done better (I've never heard someone curse more convincingly than Ripley in the smoke-filled corridor) And my favorite : Ripley searching for the obligatory cat in the cockpit. In that scene, everything, even the music wants to fool you. I think Hitchcock would be pleased.<br/><br/>On top of all this, the cast without any exception (a rare occasion) do sterling work. To single out any of them would be wrong.<br/><br/>Do I still need to say I like this movie ? Thought not. I gave it 8 for being a true classic in it's field."
"pc95","10","1","3","30 July 2005"," Top Science Fiction Movie
","It doesn't get any better for science fiction fans than Alien. Along with Blade Runner, this is one of the best science fiction movies and along with the Shining one of the best horror movies out there. It transcends either genre by combining the two. Both cast and direction are simple, effective, and focused. The set designs are a standard in themselves mimicked by 10's of other movies, and borrowed often. The violence is well placed and not over-done or glorified. Explanations are well thought out and suspense is also top-notch. The conception and implementation of the creature itself still beats the CGI of today over 25 years later. I might have enjoyed a little bit more exploration or implications on the crashed/abandoned ship, to understand the ship's origins, but thats part of the fun anyway, leaving it up to the viewer. This movie deserves full recommendation and would be must for any fan of the genres. Enjoy the mystery, horror, suspense, and futuristic exploration of Alien."

","The beginning of Alien is fabulous. We're in the future on what seems like the kind of spaceship that will actually exist in the future, with the kind of technology that we, at that time, thought we would have in the future. The whole film is very realistic, making the suspension of disbelief very easy for me. The acting is fantastic with characters who have the same problems getting along with each other that we often do, and the same ""colorful"" language that keeps my wife from letting my kids watch this movie. The only flaws with the film is that the humans are sometimes a little stupid, staring and screaming at the alien instead of shooting it, and that our star risks her life for her stupid cat. The great risk is that if the alien got back to earth, it could wipe out the planet, giving our protagonists the chance to be noble by self-destructing their ship.<br/><br/>This was a serious movie. It didn't have the silly dialog that kept star wars light and happy. These people didn't use the force or any other fantasy goblins or vampires. This was deep, dark, hard-core science fiction of the best kind, and it was very well done."

The characters are all very solid, even the ones knocked off early! Scott did an excellent job rising the creep factor higher and higher, along with Giger. H.R. Giger is a GENIUS! His designs are so unique, and odd, yet fascinating. The Alien itself, the Space Jockey, the Space Jockey's Ship, The Nostromo. It was all so excellently innovated. I LOVED the look of the Nostromo. It's just so creepy. The claustrophobic feel of everything, the Gothic look with the paneling on the walls, and the shapes of the halls (hey, that rhymes!) it always feels like something's not quite right. Like there's something you missed, something wrong. It added to the creep factor of this movie an incredible amount. In my opinion, 10/10!

Scott obviously saw this movie and took those aspects that scared the pants off an five year old and turned it into something that scared the pants off a twenty-five year old (at the time).<br/><br/>More than twenty years later, I still believe the two greatest SciFi flicks ever are ""Alien"" and ""It, The Terror Beyond Space."""

","I've never seen a more perfect blend of sci-fi and horror. H.R. Giger's alien design is very unique and horrific. Scott's choice to refrain from showing the creature too much was brilliant. Every time we do see it, we are caught between wanting to turn away or observing and taking in every detail of the creature while we can. Along with Jamie Lee Curtis of 'HalloweeN', Sigourney Weaver makes one of the greatest heroines in film history. And Jerry Goldsmith's score is very haunting and atmospheric. If you can get your hands on the original DVD release, there is an alternate rejected score that Goldsmith composed. There's an alternate Director's cut which features a few new scenes that are irrelevant to the story, but they are welcomed anyway. Most of the following sequels were quite worthy entries, 'Aliens' actually being my personal favorite film in the entire series. If you haven't seen it, do so. It's a must."

Indeed no-one can here you scream, and this silent filming method prepares us for many of our characters to (spoiler) be killed by the deadly Alien, leaving Ripley on her own...<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver plays the character 'Ripley' in this film, who is part of a group of crew members aboard a mining spaceship. The space ship interior looks great, and director Scott keeps the corridors dark to build up tension. After receiving an SOS call, the crew of the space ship land on a strange planet where they find thousands of what seem to be eggs. It would be harsh to spoil this films to the people unfortunate not to see it, but poor old John Hurt has a terrible death when a small, baby alien pops out of his stomach. I say 'pops out' because new comers will want the surprises. The small Alien very funnily zooms across the kitchen floor in the spaceship, where all the crew members are left in silence, with a new addition to their crew, an alien!<br/><br/>Its great to see that no CGI was used in this film, as I have explained that pure realism can't be beaten by hand made special effects in many other reviews. All the aliens in this film were produced using puppets and models, which look fantastic. I love the way you see the aliens acid spill out their moths on the close up shots, and the shiny, silver teeth. The acting is good and is probably the best performance we see of Sigourney weaver in the alien series, as unfortunately, by the time we get to alien3, its all getting a bit too much with the constant ""F**k you, man!. There's just no need for it. Alien is a film to enjoy because of the excellent directing, like The terminator. The sounds are great, camera angle are good, and its a memorable flick."
"mentalcritic","8","1","3","20 December 2004"," A study in coupling primal terror with a slow, languid pace
","In the wake of Star Wars' release some two years previous, science fiction films, dramas set in a science fiction world, or action films set in a science fiction world, became all the rage, so to speak. The idea of a horror film in a science fiction setting was somewhat more obscure, but that doesn't mean it wasn't under the spotlight. As a result, there was a wide audience for Alien, and the methods used to make it in particular were under great scrutiny even before shooting began.<br/><br/>The first hour or so of the film sets up the Human protagonists. As I have said in my comments about the third film in this franchise, you could almost title this film Human, because in the end, it is the hostility with which the Human characters interact that becomes their doom, metaphorically speaking. It is also interesting to note that of the four Alien films to star Sigourney Weaver, this is the only one where she does not receive top billing. In fact, Tom Skerritt gets this rather auspicious honour in spite of the fact that he is more or less written out about halfway through the running time.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, I am going to restrict my comments to the original theatrical release of the film. While the director's cut follows the usual Ridley Scott curiosity of a director's cut being shorter than the theatrical release (at least if the IMDb is to be believed), I have yet to see it in spite of some of the negatives I have heard about it. Scott is also on record as saying that he prefers the theatrical version, making one wonder at how the minds of Fox marketing work.<br/><br/>It is not until about halfway through the film that we get to see the titular antagonist, and boy what a sight it is. Unlike the sequels, in which the Aliens often move about so rapidly that it is hard to make out the details, the Alien portrayed by Bolaji Badejo or Eddie Powell, depending on the danger factor of how the Alien is meant to move, takes its sweet time to move anywhere. There's a few possible explanations for this. Either this particular Alien is meant to be some kind of drone, or it takes on the characteristics of the animal it came from (the Human from which the Alien is ""birthed"" is established as being a bit ""slow""). Then again, perhaps Scott realised that with all the work H.R. Giger put into the level of detail, it was a good idea to show it off. Another factor is that the Alien here is not facing a group of professional soldiers or mercenaries, and knows it can take its sweet time.<br/><br/>After much thought and debate, I gave Alien an eight out of ten. There are moments when the languid pace counts against it, although they are few in number, and Veronica Cartwright really fits the role of the protagonist you look forward to seeing killed. In spite of those factors, Alien really gives the viewer something to leap out of their chair to. As such, it will stand as a relic of a time just before Hollywood bought into the ""dumbest buy the mostest"" mentality."

","Alien was a time breaker in society for films of the 70's. Unbelievable was the special effects and the acting and the story line. You wouldn't think possible of the 70's. But they had a perfectionist at hand, of RIDLEY SCOTT. The photography is just of the planet for its age as is the cinematography and acting. Alien is about a ensemble of people returning to earth, and that is where the conflict arrives, they have been awoken from hypersleep to check out this new planet which they believe to have life of it. They will son find out if it does or not. Siqurney Weaver is absolutely perfect for the part of 'RIPLEY' because she is tough, strong and very agile.

",""" I can't lie to you about your chances, but you have my sympathy."" (Ash) What are the chances we'd see a movie like Alien made in 2004. Slim to none. Movies today are used as tools to sell us products and entertain out limited mental and emotional intelligence. Studios know the ""American Public"" will invest in their product whether or not the product is of any value to the consumer. The entertainment business is more concerned about selling a product than expressing artistic freedom. Can you imagine the ""dinner scene"" filmed in 2004? Kane would be eating Space McDonalds and drinking Space Starbucks before his space visitor made an appearance. Another example, Mother would become The Microsoft Nostromo Pentium Computer. ""Alien"" would have to be altered because it doesn't target the 12 to 18 age-group. The screenplay would be altered to dumb down the language and add ""cliche pop phrases"". The first 45 minutes would no longer build up the exposition;instead, the Nostromo crew would encounter the ""Alien"" within 15 minutes and the rest of the movie would contain useless CGI. ""Alien"" shows us once upon a time you could make movies free from corporate influence."

","My favorite horror movie and my favorite monster. This movie is the best on sci-fi and horror. It has the suspense to make you sweat, because we never know when it appears, and when it does you can hear your heart beating. In some scenes you can hear a heart beat, like in the scene where Bret is searching for the cat and the Alien appears behind him. The scene that scared me more was the scene where the ""facehugger"" jumps from the egg. During this scene i jumped from the sofa and almost it my head on the ceiling. the other scene was the borning of the alien, when he bursts from Kane's rib cage. That scene impressed I almost vomited during the scene. And my favorite scenes including the two that I said before, are the scene where we see Parker and Lambert being attacked by the Alien, the scene where Bret dies searching for the cat, and the final scenes with the Alien. I enjoyed to the other Alien movies and I truly recommend this one to any person ho hasn't seen the first.<br/><br/>My rating 10/10 stars."

","Why can't they make sci/fi/ horror movies like this anymore? I am not a huge fan of scifi but this film sticks to the meaning of horror and shows it. In order to make a great movie, a good story is what counts not good effects. Great cast, they all do their job, no one overacts. Especially Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm, they do great jobs.<br/><br/>Also brilliant direction by Ridley Scott. When they made this movie, they did'nt have CGI effects or digital editing.

","Alien is not a bad film at all.<br/><br/>The reason Alien seems ""trite"" is because it was the first of its kind. For the same reason the Star Wars seems over used is because everyone borrows ideas from the two.<br/><br/>The characters seem sterile to set the viewer apart from them. The film is cold, because death is cold. You can feel the character's emotions, such as when the alien erupts from Kane's chest. Genuine fear.<br/><br/>Those actors were not as experienced as they are today.<br/><br/>Overdone set design? HR Giger doesn't have anything overdone. It is the way it needed to be to set the mood of the film.<br/><br/>The characters look for Jones because he is part of their crew. They are struggling to hold on to that which is familiar in a world of fear.<br/><br/>I doubt many of us would act like brilliant strategists with an unknown killer lurking in the dark. Again, they are afraid.<br/><br/>The alien looks like what it is supposed to look like. Something alien something never before seen. Plus, it suit was made to fit a human. R. Scott wanted it to look like something that couldn't possibly fit a human inside of it, and he succeeded. And, it was the seventies, and their special effects were not at the same par as they are now.<br/><br/>The alien kills through instinct.

All this is true, but this movie is highly overrated. Much like Bladerunner, Scott's a great and innovative director that finds a really great niche that had been ignored for a few years, dust it off make it huge for half a second and that leads to a revival of said genre and then that genre because is popular again the film becomes old hat.

","A deep space mining crew is suddenly awakened from hyper sleep to answer the emergency beacon emitting from a ship on a nearby planet on their way home to Earth. Upon investigating the ship of the beacon's origin, they are introduced to a new alien species...<br/><br/>Possible Spoilers: <br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, Alien is the epitome of ultimate terror. Confined spaces, very dark lighting, a small number of people stranded very far away from home, facing an invincible and sadistically evil alien who eats humans for breakfast, and which is born by ripping out of a person's chest. Not only that, the damn thing has two mouths, acid for blood, and makes Superman's strength look like it's comparable to that of a hairless baby mouse. H.R. Geiger is one sick S.O.B. for coming up with the design for this damn thing. I bet he's a big opium freak, as suggested in the new dvd, and a good thing too because it's the craziest alien life form I've ever seen created. A journey into his mind could make any serial killer cry, I'm sure.<br/><br/>Films like this simply aren't made anymore, and if they are, I certainly haven't seen any of them. Ridley Scott sets his name in stone in the terror department of film and sci-fi, period. The tension is built up perfectly, and throughout the film you never really get too much of a good look at the alien itself, making it even scarier than it really is because it's a mystery. This is also complimented by the technique of using minimal lighting in the film, which was a wise choice, otherwise it might be kind of silly seeing some guy in a rubber suit jumping around. The musical score simply adds to the already creepy environment and imagery, haunting and brooding at just the right times without giving away anything yet to come.<br/><br/>
The cast is a good one featuring Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Ian Holm and a few other familiar faces that not only seem believable, but have a nice chemistry running between them. In all probability, such a deep space mining crew might just be assembled as such, if it were reality of course and we actually had such a means to do such things. And Weaver can really play being terrified out of her mind with he eyes closed, as she also displays masterfully in the subsequent sequel.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the special effects hold up to today's standards despite being a quarter of a century old. Of course there's no CGI, but I think in many cases that that's a good thing. Too many director's nowadays seem to feel differently, much to my dismay, even though there are exceptions. <br/><br/>
If you haven't already seen it, you're seriously missing out on a truly terrifying and epic sci-fi experience. Many people in the film industry have recognized this and is why so many sequels were made. <br/><br/>
But I do have to ask, were did Weaver get those undies? Yuck.<br/><br/>One of my favorite movies of all time. The purest definition of terror and fear on film. Do not watch if you are pregnant or have heart problems. Flawless."
"icesyckel","10","1","3","29 January 2004"," The Greatest SciFi - Horror Film Ever
","10/10  Movie: Alien (1979)<br/><br/>Scroll to bottom for bottom line.<br/><br/>Some movies aspire to be what Alien is. It is in my mind and the minds of many others what SciFi is all about_: a sense of wondering. Every glimpse of the derelict vessel on LV-420 is a glimpse into the depths of human imagination.<br/><br/>Some SciFi movies are filled with adventure, and some with romance, or ingenuity, but Alien is a SciFi movie filled with horror, suspense, and wonder. The basic question SciFi always gets around to is not about the future or its innovations, but whether we are alone in the universe. Is there someone, or someone else out there?<br/><br/>Alien has the answer, and it may be more than you are willing to handle. The movie is definitely not suitable for younger viewers, as it is among Hollywood's finest suspense films. There are moments in ALien that would make any reasonable person shake in his skin.<br/><br/>And now for the breakdown:<br/><br/>Sound: Simply eerie. The ambient sounds in the background, the humming and pinging of the ship, metallic clankings, and every squeal of the Alien adds to the suspense and fear the viewer will be doubtlessly experiencing.<br/><br/>
Music: Once again, eerie. everything audiowise in this movie deserves that adjective. the music is soft and understated, but in this type of film the soft creepy tones you hear are perfect. I am quite certain a large musical score would have been too distracting, and what audiences did get was a very soft musical presence that supplements the movie's mood.<br/><br/>Set Design/Scenery: This film is the best SciFi film I have ever seen, even to date, for the set design. SciFi films always try to make the settings look to grandiose or too extravagent. The Nostromo, however, looks like a warehouse or a factory, with only a small area designed to accomodate the crew. It really looks like it was designed for mining purposes since machinery and equipment dominate the ship while there are but smally cubby holes for the crew (which Parker or Brett one decorated with nudy photos - adding to the realism). LV420 is equally impressive with its harsh conditions and low visibility. Most impressive of all for me was the derelict alien spacecraft and the ""Pilot"" as he is so often referred to as. The scenes of that ship are simply beyond description, and to think the movie was released into theaters in 1979! You would never know it from the sets.<br/><br/>Plot: Amazing. I hate to overstate anything, and I rarely am so giving with my praise as this, but the plot was amazing. It is sort of simple, but unique. An evil unnamed (at least in the first film) corporation redirects one of its mining ships to intercept a communication of unknown origin. The crew rises from Cryo-sleep to investigate the signal, as is required by a clause in their contracts under penalty of ""total forfeiture of shares"". The crew sets own on the planet where the signal has come from. Some of the crew investigate the derelict alien spacecraft that has long been on the planet while Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) discovers to their dismay that the signal was in fact a distress signal. Meanwhile, those of the crew inspecting the derelict ship find that its pilot is dead in his chair: something burst through his ribcage. It would appear that their was a second species on the derelict ship, and it is very much alive. What's worse, a member of the second species<br/><br/>Subplots: This movie had a few of them. There was the ongoing stryfe between Parker, Brett, and the rest of the crew. Apparently Parker and Brett get paid half as much as the rest of the crew, and there was a lot of tension concerning the ""bonus situation"". Also, there was the relationship between the creature and the Company, and also the betrayal of Ash and his connection to the Company. I am also given pause to wonder more about the origins of the Pilot species and its connection to the alien (ie - why all those eggs were aboard its ship and where the rest of its crew was if any ever existed). There was a lot left to the imagination. My biggest gripe with Alien's sequels is that none of them deal with these latter questions. Maybe Alien Versus the Predator will go into it, but I doubt it. Actually, I am hoping that it will not, since any answers given would be rushed in a film about both these creatures. With a poor director like Paul Anderson on the AVP film, I am sure a lot of the alien and predator fans will see their favorite SciFi characters dragged through the mud.<br/><br/>Mood: Eerie (have I said that enough?). Thanks largely to the white areas of the living area sof the Nostromo contrasting with the metal, dark-coloured mechanical portions of the ship where the creature lurks, the film manages to create a simultaneously gritty and sterile environment either of which could get the mind wandering places one wouldn't want it to in such a place. Even without the alien lurking about the halls of the Nostromo it is a breeding ground for fear. The movie definitley illicits fear and eerieness. It also illicits a feeling of remoteness as a result of truly feeling distanced from the rest of humankind. The small number of people in the cast helps add to the feeling of isolation that allows the imagination to really go wild conjuring up all kinds of opportunies for the alien to appear when in fact the creature often appears when you least expect it.<br/><br/>Dialogue/Characterization: There is no over-acting here. the characters all act exactly as a I would expect random people in such a predicament to react. They were not soldiers or explorers (well Kane was sort of an explorer at heart -- poor guy should have known he was in a horror flick where it least pays to have that pioneering spirit), but they were miners and truckers of the futuristic sort. Weaver, Skerrit, Cartwright, Stanton, and Kotto all performed as their characters would have had the situation been real. This sounds like a duh for most movies, but SciFi actors usually overact, and characters in horror movies rarely act with any semblance of human nature. This movie comes across with a real presence ofor both genres with character that were both written and acted believably.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Buy this movie if you ever buy anything else SciFi or horror. In fact, buy the whole Quadriology in box set. The last two films are markedly lower quality than the first two, but there was a lot of room to fall from standard set by Alien and Aliens. the latter two films are still enjoyable, and buy the time you have paid for Alien and Aliens, you may as well shell out an extra $20 and have the whole 9-disc set."

","There are so many reasons to love this movie. I saw it on the big screen back in '79 and was in awe. This movie doesn't even attempt to meet you with explanations for every squeak, squawk, or line uttered unintelligibly. It remains mysterious and tense throughout. You never even get a really clear look at the creature (a la 'The Thing From Another World'). On the other hand you don't feel disappointed that you never get a clear look. The tension, anxiety and claustrophobia settles right into your gut and stays throughout the pic thus satisfying what you originally came to the movie for in the first place. Giger's creature is art and apparently began a whole industry of look-a-likes. But this is the original and best in my book. I thought the sequels were great as well but Scott's direction conveys an oppressive atmosphere not present in the sequels. This puts it at a certain pinnacle the others didn't quite reach. Let's run through the accolades - shall we? The acting is top-notch and quite believable. The sound track - or frequent lack thereof - maintains the dread very adequately. The special effects are still good. The camera work is precise in every scene. And the pacing never lets up. You worry about what's around the corner with every scene. A neat little gem that belongs in every sci-fi/horror library. Very worthy of multiple viewings."

","Just yesterday, I re-watched Ridley Scott's classic 1979 science-fiction epic ""Alien.""  I haven't watched ""Alien"" in about two years and in that time, I've felt that the movie now seems dated and has lost its impact. Really, not so as I found out yesterday.  I watched the director's cut that was part of the 9-disc quadrilogy set and I have to say that this movie really got to me this time, which has never before happened when I've watched this.  I have always liked James Cameron's ""Aliens"" as my favorite movie in the series (and it still is) but I feel I have to rethink a number of thoughts I have towards the original.<br/><br/>First, Ridley Scott is an amazing filmmaker and his work in this film has only been matched by David Fincher's direction in ""Alien 3.""  What I mean by that comment is that Fincher matched it in atmosphere, not like James Cameron or Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director of ""Alien: Resurrection""), both of whose visions were more action-oriented, much rather than suspense.  Just three years after making ""Alien,"" Scott would go to direct Harrison Ford in ""Blade Runner.""<br/><br/>Second, the production design.  Everything just looks so dark and eerily beautiful.  The space scenes are almost hypnotic; we've gotten so used to seeing space in the movies that it rarely surprises us anymore.  With the production here, the space scenes are really stand out and show us that we really aren't alone in the universe.  The scenes on the alien planet are truly scary too.<br/><br/>Third, the acting especially by Sigourney Weaver as Ripley.  She looks so young in this movie (she was only about 24 when this was made).  I liked her character a lot in this movie in that we see shades of her future role in ""Aliens.""  The rest of the cast is pretty sufficient too, especially from Veronica Cartwright as Lambert.  We see in later scenes the fear in her character.  I somehow got the feeling that she was really on the verge of a nervous breakdown.<br/><br/>Fourth, the movie itself.  ""Alien"" is a downright scary and effective science-fiction film.  It's a landmark film and has spawned an incredible afterlife in not only comic books and three highly successful sequels, but also a rival series (""Predator"").<br/><br/>""Alien"" - 10/10"

The movie had much more impact, was more immersive and made me jump slightly several times in the cinema. I'm not sure what scenes were added for this version but it seems surprising that scenes were cut in the first place considering the running time is under 2 hours.<br/><br/>Alien is a damn good film, pipped at the post by Aliens for all-around best Alien film. Alien is definately the scariest of the lot and is an expert film in every regard (I'm still not sure about the use of dripping water though). The film had a slightly ""Thing""-ish quality in that there's a lone beast that can stike at any time, and it's not clear who is friend and who is foe, it was good to see all these now well-known actors in younger bodies trying to save their own skin.

"saloonytoon","10","1","3","1 November 2003"," One Of A Kind *SPOILERS*
","I first saw ALIEN at it's very first showing in 1979, after standing in line for hours thinking ""this flik better be worth all this trouble"". Twenty four years later I feel justified in saying ""yeah, it was worth it"". This movie stands alone in it's ability to reach down into my psyche and give me a taste of what it must have been like for early humans to have been on the menu of large animals with sharp teeth on a regular basis. To me this IS the scariest movie of all time for the simple reason that it is the only one that almost made me leave the theater from sheer terror ....and I've seen them all. There is a certain magic that happens when story, direction, cinematography, and music combine in such a way that produces a truly transcendant experience. ALIEN is one of those. I've wondered why ALIEN has had such a profound effect on me that other ""scary"" movies haven't and I think it has to do with how the story is grounded in reality the way most others aren't. The Nostromo crew are working stiffs like you and me, although their work place is outer space. I'm not sure but I think space freighters of the future will probably be dirty and broken down, with tchotchke's lying around. Not only does this make them real to me, it makes their situation all the more personal to me as well. The sci-fi genre is cool and all, but the core of ALIEN's powerful impact is that all of us have that primeval fear of something coming up from the basement, or down from the attic to GET us. Even worse is the fact that this COULD actually happen in the not too distant future given the unknown universe and it's possibly hostile inhabitants. The one scene that has come to symbolize this movie for me is the cold, unemotional way the robot Ash conveys his admiration for the alien in the line: ""I admire it's purity.....a survivor....unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality"". The ingredients of the perfect movie monster. It's coming to get you, and you can't stop it because it would like nothing BETTER than to get you......nothing personal, you understand. A horrifying thought if there ever was one. Very few movies have the lasting effect this one had on myself and many others and I'm glad to have the chance to throw in my two cents here."
"Sondev","10","1","3","1 November 2003"," Great Movie - Director's cut doesn't add anything
","No spoilers included.<br/><br/>The director's cut of this film felt like an excuse to release it back in theaters, not really to enhance the original movie. They should have put the original version out there since there are only minor differences anyway, you are essentially watching the same film.<br/><br/>Anyway, whatever version you are watching is an excellent one. This movie is a slow paced, suspense filled sci-fi horror film. You may not like it, but you should at least give it a chance. A lot of movies have copied elements from it, however there has never been another movie with an atmosphere quite like it, including it's sequels.<br/><br/>What sets this apart from other horror films is great acting, amazing sets, overall attention to detail and amazing sound.<br/><br/>This critics always say that this film's biggest problem is a lack of character development. I think this was done on purpose because the film doesn't really need you to care about it's characters, however tries to place you in their shoes. Even with this approach, the acting is so good that you will feel like you get to know some of the characters. Specifically, I thought Weaver, Cartwright, Kotto and Stanton gave amazing performances for what they had to work with in the script.<br/><br/>Some of the sets used in the film are dated, specifically the computers. Considering that it came out before you could buy a personal computer makes these mistakes forgivable though. It doesn't really take away from the what the film is trying to do.<br/><br/>One thing to notice in this film is how brilliant the use of sound is. You can tell what's going on in the film if you have your eyes closed. The combination of a great score by Jerry Goldsmith, sound effects and even the times where the film is completely silent create a great audio work of art. The suspense is generated from sound more than from what you see. Combining this with the typical eye candy you would expect from a Ridley Scott film and you have something special.<br/><br/>10/10 - It has flaws but it's better than any other movie like it."
"Tampa_Tom","10","1","3","31 October 2003"," This rocks in theaters
","I've seen Alien before on TV, DVD and VHS, but there is absolutely no comparing that small screen experience with the drama of seeing everything larger than life.<br/><br/>In the theater, I was amazed how much I had missed watching the movie on TV. Facial expressions, use of light, etc. were all amplified in the darkness of the theater.<br/><br/>Some scenes that translated particularly well were:<br/><br/>* The med lab.  Dallas, Ash and Ripley searching for the now missing face hugger was even more tense.  Again, the great use of different camera angles (low, high, trailing behind, etc.) made me believe the face hugger was ready to spring and attack from anywhere.<br/><br/>* Dallas in the air ducts.  Scott saw how the use of very little light in the middle of the screen - bordered by all of that black - would give an overwhelming impression of claustrophobia and funnel the viewer right to the middle of the frame.  Genius.<br/><br/>* The ten-minute self destruct countdown.  Chaos reigns with lights and sirens, hissing mechanicals, etc.  I've seen the movie at least 20 times, but the countdown was so gripping, I was literally sitting forward in my seat waiting to see if Ripley made it.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm leaving out dozens of other scenes that make this movie a classic and a MUST SEE while it's out in theaters.<br/><br/>Now, I'm looking forward to Alien vs. Predator..."
"saloonytoon","10","1","3","30 October 2003"," ONE OF A KIND
","I first saw ALIEN at it's very first showing in 1979, after standing in line for hours thinking ""this flik better be worth all this trouble"". Twenty four years later I feel justified in saying ""yeah, it was worth it"". This movie stands alone in it's ability reach down into my psyche and give me a taste of what it must have been like for early humans to have been on the menu of large animals with sharp teeth on a regular basis. To me this IS the scariest movie of all time for the simple reason that it is the only one that almost made me leave the theater from sheer terror ....and I've seen them all. There is a certain magic that happens when story, direction, cinematography, and music combine in such a way that produces a truly transcendent experience. ALIEN is one of those. I've wondered why ALIEN has had such a profound effect on me that other ""scary"" movies haven't and I think it has to do with how the story is grounded in reality the way most others aren't. The Nostromo crew are working stiffs like you and me, although their work place is outer space. I'm not sure but I think space freighters of the future will probably be dirty and broken down, with tchotchke's lying around. Not only does this make them real to me, it makes their situation all the more personal to me. The sci-fi genre is cool and all, but the core of ALIEN's powerful impact is that all of us have that atavistically primeval fear of something coming up from the basement, or down from the attic to GET us. Even worse is the fact that this COULD actually happen in the not too distant future given the unknown universe and it's possibly hostile inhabitants.<br/><br/>The one scene that has come to symbolize this movie for me is the cold, unemotional way the robot Ash conveys his admiration for the alien in the line: ""I admire it's purity.....a survivor....unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality"". The ingredients of the perfect movie monster. It's coming to get you, and you can't stop it because it would like nothing better than to get you......nothing personal, you understand. A horrifying thought if there ever was one. Very few movies have the lasting effect this one had on myself and many others and I'm glad to have the chance to throw in my two cents here."
"aharmas","10","1","3","2 November 2003"," a fine classic
","In an era where spectacle and special effects have taken over, it is refreshing to see a re-release of a classic.  When ""Alien"" came out in the late 70's, it scared the hell out of me.  It was dark, scary, packed with tension, and a realistic and horrid creature.  We had no time to worry about words, but about the survival of the crew, and as if everyone knows by now, chances of escaping were dim.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's directing job is probably his finest.  When we first wander into the planetoid, we are fully transported there with a sense of foreboding.  The place is unlike anything ever seen before.  There is plenty of wonder, but it's also colored by the possibility of terror in its dark atmosphere.  People might have criticized the screenplay for not developing the cast enough, but that would have diverted the focus from the main story line.  How do these people get out of this mess?  These are strong and defined characters, but they don't have too many lines because they don't need them.  The scientist for instance, works beautiful because it all happens in his eyes.  We don't need to know or hear what motivates him. Ripley is a strong, silent, and direct heroine.  She is fantastic.<br/><br/>The alien rightfully earned its place in the classic monster pantheon.  Here is a beast whose nature is not understood.  We witness its magnificient design and purpose, but we don't ask too many questions.  It is beautiful and horrifying, appealing to us in unexplainable ways.  We fear and admire it at the same time.<br/><br/>The new edition features a gorgeous remastering of the soundtrack, and one can now fully appreciate the superb score.  It should be mandated that the classics are released again in the big screen.  DVD's are wonderful, but some films deserved to show their magic in the best possible way."

","Alien is a true horror sci-fi classic.  The film is a staple of american cinema and one of our only true masterpieces!  Sigourney Weaver made her big screen debut as the film's leading lady. A heroine that would go onto to develop and influence every female heroine that came after her.  It all starts when they investigate a strange signal coming from a nearby planet. They investigate the source and one of the crew members is attacked by a deadly E.T. They bring him aboard the ship and in a exquisitely terrifying scene the alien is born and gets loose upon the ship. It begins to grow as it feeds and soon comes fater the remaining cast members. With scenes that set the standard for every suspense scene ever filmed. Ridley Scott directs the film with horrific pizazz piling on the horror laden suspense and intelliegent and convincing performances. The direction is taut and the cinematography is claustraphobic and intense."

","Alien is probably the best sci-fi film ever created. With dark, claustrophobic sets, dim lights and that hideous looking monster, this film really has it all.<br/><br/>The storyline is a great one, no matter if it was taken from the classic fifty films. After receiving an S.O.S, the crew of the ship Nostromo go to see whats wrong, due to law. What they find will haunt most for weeks.<br/><br/>Though the film moves slowly to start with, once we are introduced to the alien the film picks up and starts. With the greatest looking monster right behind them, the crew of the ship slowly start disappearing. But unlike old fifties films, we know what's picking them off which adds to the sheer terror.<br/><br/>The sets, again, are great, but they don't draw the attention to themselves so you can really concentrate on what's happening. Actually, they increase the feel that these people are in a real ship being chased by a monster.<br/><br/>The film keeps on going until the ultimate showdown between woman and beast. A must for anyone who likes the genre, has seen one of the sequels or has played the game and read the comics. 10/10."

","More than any other science fiction movie of the seventies; this Ridley Scott classic married the genres of sci fi with the horror genre. From the haunting first presence of the mining ship, Nostromo to the end credits, this film can still rivet the viewer to their seat, as HR Giger's alien creation progressively wreaks havoc on all members of the ship's crew. Maybe it is only in space where no one can hear you scream, but this deftly crafted film can still raise hairs on the arms of those whose home is terrestrial. A truly memorable achievement by Scott complimented by an outstanding cast including John Hurt and Ian Holm as well as a confident performance by Sigourney Weaver."
"jessfink","10","1","3","13 October 2003"," One of the best of all time
","Look, you're entitled to your opinion.  If you think this movie is overrated, you'll never be a convert.  I am not given to hyperbole...check my other reviews and see.  I am hard to impress...cynical, even.  But how anyone could watch this film and be underwhelmed is beyond me. <br/><br/>
One of the reasons I respond to it as strongly as I do is BECAUSE of the wonderful characterizations by the strong cast, especially Veronica Cartwright and Yaphet Kotto.  Watching this film, one can't help but marvel at how much MOVIE is there, how much texture and backstory is layered in the all-too-few group scenes, and think wistfully of the action or horror movies that are made with ensemble casts nowadays.  Those are made of carticatures, to be slashed/eaten/blown up one by one, meaningless and disposable.  Look at ""Scary Movie"", which successfully lampooned this archetypal, boring standard-issue cast makeup.  <br/><br/>In the case of 'Alien', however, you have a real cast, of real characters, and when they all gradually meet their maker ( I don't think that this is a spoiler--who doesn't know the premise of the 'Alien' movies??), I don't know who can't honestly feel bad for each one of them.  When Tom Skerritt swallows hard and volunteers to do something you know is not going to prolong his life, you genuinely want to scream at the screen...NO!<br/><br/>Everyone knows about the extraordinary design, the amazing performance delivered by Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, and the fantastically creepy Alien.  How can everyone know if it is such a bad movie?  I can't think of a bad word to say about it.  The tension builds like music.  The chills and thrills are exhilarating.  The creepy, tragic feeling of doom and despair is palpable.  It's a masterpiece of storytelling, if you ask me, done in such a spare and elegant fashion it makes me marvel every time I watch it. Superlative."

","That is simply it this movie is fantastic, Ridley's use of camera and mood set a benchmark for other horror directors to follow. acompanied by how little he actually showed of the Alien and how HUMAN the characters seem to be. Now most will argue that yes Alien is a better film, in my personal opinion Alien is the best in the series, that's not to say i don't LOVE Aliens but it's more of an action movie than a thriller/horror. this disapointed me at first but when i watched it again i just relised how cool it actually was. Thankfully Alien 3 was released which brought back all that suspence and great camera and mood i love (especially when you see it from the Alien's perspective, that's just down right freaky). Alien 4.........well......um.....urrr........i'm sorry but it was just crap, focused way too much on gore and the cloning part? what the hell is with that I mean even if they could bring her DNA back (out of hot lead!!!) the chances of an Alien being inside yer a like the chances of me shuting up about this awfull movie. which i shall do know."

","In 1979, I was four years old. I had just seen STAR WARS for the first time and was amazed. I remember my neighbor had a sleepover birthday party for my friend Chris in the fall of 1980 and we were all fascinated by space movies (BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, BUCK RODGERS) ESPECIALLY after just seeing THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. This kid's mother was not the brightest bulb in the bunch. She rented some space sci-fi movies for us, one of them was ALIEN.<br/><br/>
We all know what happened at the dinner table scene with Kane. When that part happened, the crying began and the Beta tape was taken out of the tape player by the mom.<br/><br/>I actually finished watching ALIEN around 1988 or so. Even as a 14-year old kid who was starting to love horror movies, ALIEN still freaked me out. Ironically enough, I was still hanging out with my friend Chris at the time and we watched ALIEN and HALLOWEEN for the first time.<br/><br/>ALIEN is a classic Sci-Fi/Horror film with an outstanding cast. Tom Skerrit is Dallas, the ship commander. Yapphet Kotto redeems himself from playing a TERRIBLE villian in the Bond film LIVE AND LET DIE, as the tough guy Parker. Ian ""Bilbo Baggins"" Holm is Ash, the science offer with ulterior motives. Rounding out the cast is John Hurt, Veronica Cartwright and of course, Sigourney Weaver.<br/><br/>The movie begins when the commercial towing vessel, the NOSTROMO, is ordered by The Company to explore a transmission of unknown origin on a deserted planet. Without giving anything away, an alien gets on board the ship and wreaks havoc on the crew.<br/><br/>Like BLADE RUNNER, this is literally a dark movie. Most of it takes place on a dark spaceship and you don't know what is lurking around the corner. This adds to the scariness of the film. I have watched this so many times that I'm immune to it freaking me out now. Unfortunately, the sequels were not as good, in my opinion (I know everyone argues that ALIENS was superior.)<br/><br/>This movie is Ridley Scott's best work and BLADE RUNNER follows a very close second."

A slick head with a detailed mouth of tendons. I jumped up to try and get a closer look.<br/><br/>Then the movie really started. The Alien pops up suddenly and it takes you a while to get over it. When you see Ash we jumped even though we knew he was there.<br/><br/>Even though I'd read the ""Making of"" book (Dissecting Aliens: Terror in Space), I thought it was over when Ripley got into the shuttle. Then after a few minutes of watching it was over.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen it, you're missing out on one of the best films ever."
"EijnarAmadeus","10","1","3","29 July 2003"," In space no one can hear you scream....of pleasure that is
","ALIEN reaches at least the Top 20 of movies I've ever seen. It's a tight, controlled story about a crew being terrorised by an unknown specie. Sigourney Weaver is one of the seven members of the spaceship named Nostromo, a cargo-ship that spends most of its time flying from planet to planet. Nostromo's cold, empty halls and corridors makes the movie's atmosphere lost and definite, as we (and the crew) knows that they're no longer alone. Ridley Scott directs the movie with such an easy hand, he doesn't do anything unexpected, he just makes the movie as rock solid as a science fiction thriller will ever be. The alien itself, the movie's main character, is shockingly revealed half way through the movie as Nostromo's captain Dallas encounters the vicious creature in a one-way-ticket situation, and the alien is without doubt one of the most impressive and greatly made monsters in movie history. ALIEN is a classic, a pioneer in horror movie making."

","I saw this film originally in Seattle when it first opened. As a sci-fi buff, paticularly in my youth in the 50's, I was impressed by it's quality, it's gothic aura, it's excellent acting by a top notch cast, and it's creation of the first truly female hero I had ever seen in a movie. There have been a lot of ""heroines"" in movies but this paved new ground. Maybe someone could come up with an example I missed but I've given it some thought and I draw a blank in trying to compare it to anything that came before. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, the Science Officer, was the only person on board the ship that kept her head when all hell was breaking loose.She had no romantic or family ties to any other character that caused her to rise up and take over for her husband like Pilar say, in Hemingway's ""For Whom the Bell Toll's."" She was not merely equal to a man or inspitational like the Katherine Hepburn's Rose in the African Queen. She had no special gifts like Joan of Arc, Wonder Woman, or Sheena of the jungle. There were no sexy gimmicks, she never deffered to any of the male crew except by rank. In other words she was like  John Wayne's, Clint Eastwood's, or Sylvester Stallone's characters in her ability to get things done and keep her head. Sigourney, by the way, is a hell of a lot better actor then any of those guys. This was a good movie in many ways but I've never heard it mentioned as a ground breaking vehicle for women's equality."

Everyone who helped make this film all talk about the incredibility of it and show what it was like to make this ""genre"" film at the time (1979).  In 1981, as a boy, I read the book and it enthralled me.

","This movie is a true classic. The user who says it's not as good as the sequel is just plain wrong. It is a different kind of movie than the sequel. Aliens (the sequel) is shoot 'em up action movie, which this is not. Ridley Scott is a genius, pure and simple. He made this movie for next to nothing budget wise, with no CGI and the result still stands up to this day. Only 2001 surpasses this film when it comes to effects, and that's a close race to be sure.<br/><br/>This movie is the best of the series, as far as I am concerned, because it lays the ground work for what came later. Ridley Scott's dark vision of the future is a theme he repeated in Blade Runner. On the commentary for the DVD he mentions that he would like to make an Alien 5 which goes back to where the Aliens came from to find out what they are. That's a movie I would love to see."

"Sonatine97","9","1","3","24 August 2002"," Fast Food Shocker In Outer Space!
","Alien follows all the usual shocks & horrors from your typical spooky haunted house movie. Lots of dark rooms, creepy dark corners and paranoid & scared-witless humans all dancing a merry tune trying to stay alive from the hungry monster that lurks just out of sight.<br/><br/>Alien turned the cosy, sterile world of sci-fi on its head when it first hit the screens back in 79. Until then most of the popular movie-going public had either viewed the sheer escapism and good guy Vs bad guy scenarios  of Star Wars or the intellectualism of Close Encounters. But Alien was really the first haunted house movie in space where lots of people could hear you scream!<br/><br/>Although the film isn't really all that intellectually challenging and the script is very much lightweight, the film does benefit from a great collaboration of component parts.<br/><br/>First there is Don O'Bannon's wonderfully inventive screenplay coupled with a superbly scored movie sound track by the ever-dependable Jerry Goldsmith, that really sets the mood & tempo for the film right from the eerie opening.<br/><br/>Then of course some of the lead character/actors must get a mention since they were largely unknowns both here and in the States. Sigourney Weaver in particular, is outstanding and carries the film very well, and which later improved even further with Aliens.<br/><br/>But special mention must also go to the support, including a bold performances from Ian Holm, John Hurt and Yephet Kotto.<br/><br/>Then of course there is a the set design and the construction of the Alien itself - truly the stuff of nightmares and a very inventive mind thanks to people like H. R Giger, Nick Allder and Terry Rawings.<br/><br/>It made a pleasant change to see a space ship so untidy, messy and dirty compared to what our usual expectations of a futurist space ship should look like (ie, all bright lights, sterile white walls and not a coffee cup or half-eaten doughnut in sight).<br/><br/>Admittedly the opening scene of the Nostromo panning overhead to emphasise its huge bulk is a definite steal from the classic opening from Star Wars, but from there any further similarities end.<br/><br/>Then of course to complete a good film one does need a good director, and this is where 20th Century Fox took a big gamble in the relatively unknown Ridley Scott. Before this big break Scott was a director for tv commercials in the UK, and to be honest some of that 30second trickery of getting a message across is visible in Alien at times too.<br/><br/>However, Scott is also a man of vision. Anyone who went on to see BladeRunner will testify to that. Although it can also be said that the handling of a good story in both these films left something to be desired. Scott is very much a style over content director especially when it comes to either SF (BladeRunner, Alien) or great epics such as 1492.<br/><br/>But for all that he does a very good job scaring the wits out us with Alien coupled with some very fancy photography & characterization. He builds the tension very slowly. He knows what the audience are thinking in what is about to happen, so he hoodwinks them with false shocks and other distractions that let us off the hook when we expect the worst to happen.<br/><br/>But then when he does choose to shock us he does so on his own terms and when we expect it least. Of course the chest-busting (or alien birth) not only shocked us but also most of the other actors in the film as well, because Scott simply loves playing jokes on us.<br/><br/>The only disappointment is the real shallowness of the characters. We don't get to know them all that well before they end up being picked off by the Alien. Its only Ripley that really stands out and her character becomes far more fleshed out in the excellent Aliens.<br/><br/>Although I must say I was rather disappointed at the way she was exploited at the end of the film: was there really any need to have the camera see her undress and stare at her panties close up for more than what was really needed to be tasteful?<br/><br/>Ian Holm plays his ""unusual"" character just right, with a good combination of calculating charm & menace. But Harry Dean Stanton is wasted in this movie. To my mind he is more a character actor who only really shines with a good script and much more rounded character, such as his superb role in Paris Texas. But in this movie he is just Alien Fodder with a dopey fixation of searching for the Ship's Cat all alone with the hungry little Alien is in hiding waiting for its first meal.<br/><br/>In fact the cat proved to be the linchpin throughout the film, especially near the end when for whatever reason Ripey goes in search of it with the clock ticking and the Alien chasing her for a bit more fast food.<br/><br/>A lot of people feel Aliens is the better movie, but I don't agree. Alien succeeded on a relatively small budget and an old concept of shock/horror movie making but set in space and which proved to be a huge box office success.<br/><br/>Aliens was therefore made on the back of this success, but all that was needed to make it even more better was a bigger budget, better special effects and a deeper more fleshed-out story line and characterisation. Which Aliens did in spades.<br/><br/>But for all that is big & flashy in Aliens I still feel Alien is superior, perhaps not in story-content or sfx, but certainly in atmosphere, originality and concept design.<br/><br/>****/*****"

A radio message is picked up by the ships computer, but is it a greeting or an SOS. Things take a turn for the worse when the crew investigates the signal and its; horrifying cause.<br/><br/>
Acting: The acting is all top notch. All the actors make the characters there own with little nuances mannerisms. True some of the minor characters are a bit underwritten but they hardly suffer. <br/><br/>Direction / Writing: The direction and writing is spot on with a slant towards early filmmaking: slow build up to kinetic end. Some other threads have said that the film has no scares but I say that an atmosphere is created in the film with punctuation by the occasional boo. <br/><br/>Photography / Editing: Vanlint give the film a very claustrophobic feel at times that helps things along. The production designers created one hell of a detailed ship that is amazing in it's' detail. The editing is wonderful. It really shows off the detail of the ship. <br/><br/>Sex / Nudity: We are treated to a very sleek and sexy, totally bald @ssed creature, but other than that don't get your hopes up. <br/><br/>Sleaze: Here we got nothing either. Ripley in a t-shirt and panties is all you get unless you count the sleazy science officer. <br/><br/>Overall / Parting Remarks: I consider this SciFi / Horror hybrid to be a classic. A lot of good stuff was put into this production to ensure its continued success. The film shows its' age just a little with its' computer screens and ending explosion though. Now for the new director's cut. I found it nice to see these added scenes in the film. While not really necessary it does offer more for the fans. Most of the scenes go seamlessly back into the film and neither adds nor subtract anything major. The inclusion of the Dallas scene at the end does kind of slow up the finale a bit but nothing major."

","Twenty years after Ridley Scott directed his first Hollywood movie, it's hard to remember a time when the Alien wasn't around. Thanks to designer HR Giger, the steel toothed xenomorph became the last word in big screen extra terrestrials who kill to live and live to kill. So, two decades after the event, we have four films in an ongoing series charting the adventures of ill-fated warrant officer Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who seems to be far more indestructible than her murderous rivals. The first of the quartet is a delirious fevered dream ride through the imagination of a fine director and an unrivalled designer. As Alien 5 gears up, give this another look if you get the chance.

The fact that the movie always hides the alien in the shadows made it even more frightening.

James Cameron's sequel was a better film in almost every way, but it will never make the midnight cult circuit, as Ridley Scott's history- making shocker has done.  Cameron wants you to see his movie three times at the theater, tell all your friends how great is is, and buy the video the day it comes out. That's why we love him, but it's also one of his limitations.

Both are excellent movies, but Alien is deeper, darker and scarier. The atmosphere of this movie is electric and without going into too much detail, one particular scene around the dinner table still scares me after repeated watchings. I watched it again last night and found myself unconsciously clenching my teeth and grimacing - a rarity now that so many films attempt to shock.<br/><br/>If you like your Science Fiction to have brains over brawn - Alien fits the bill. It's riveting from start to finish and amongst the shocks, there's some interesting ideas. The special effects are set design are first class, the acting excellent and it's shot beautifully.<br/><br/>See all the Alien movies (yes - even Alien3 is worth a watch) but this one is the best. If you're not normally a fan of the genre but you like intelligent thrillers, try this and you may be converted."

","Probably the best done alien film there is. From the outset you can feel the tension growing. From the music to the camera work the feel of the film is transfered to the viewer giving a real sense of empathy with the crew of the Nostromo. Many people I know pitch Aliens as the best of the series due to the gun/explosive quota. I believe that the two films complement each other in that the first is dramatic and building and the second is in your face. After the first film you know what to expect so it is good that the second films attacks the story from a different angle."

Giger's work adds exponentially to an all ready incredible visual experiance.  Even though this film was released in 1979, it is timeless.

","Welcome to one of the greatest sci-fi achievements of all time.  Scott really came through with this film.  As opposed to his more recent achievements(Black Hawk Down, Gladiator)this film is outstanding.  It is kind of sad to think that he has only now gotten recognition for his directing talent from those modern films.  In this film Weaver really begins to make a name for herself becoming a bona fide hollywood star, and with good reason.  The character Ripley is very easy to root for in these films. Unfortunately only the first two films in this series are worth watching and owning.  This film is a must see, very scary and great sci-fi."
"DorianWynHowells","10","1","3","23 January 2002"," Our first encounter with the vicious 'Alien'
","The title gives away what this film is about.<br/><br/>The film builds perfectly, and the limited cast of 7 all do well in this film, but there are two stars...Weaver as Ripley and the Alien itself. I would give anything to have seen this film on it's release! This probably scared the hell out of anyone who went to see it!!<br/><br/>The film is full of tension, and the bleak, dark, and creaking Nostromo is a vast hiding place for an Alien that we as an audience and the crew have no acquired info on. It's a new breed and a vicious one at that! Of course the Government KNOW about it's existence (they would wouldn't they!!!) and the ships computer - Mother - mis-informs (or lies as I would put it!!) the crew to go down onto a planet to answer a distress call!! They think their answering a distress call, but it's a warning....oooops!!!<br/><br/>The imagination surrounding the film's concept has to be acknowledged, it's a work of art on all levels. From concept, through to design, and the Alien itself is just terrifying!<br/><br/>Ridley Scott handles this film perfectly, he sets up a claustraphobic atmosphere in most of his scenes and the tension gets almost unbearable!<br/><br/>The main scenes are of course the 'chest bursting' scene and the introduction to the Alien. The scene where Tom Skerritt (Dallas) crawls through those tunnels and eventually meets the Alien. Who knew that a small 'bleep' on a computer screen could create sooooooo much tension???!!!! Well, it does! The final 20 minutes is also a piece of great cinema. Avoid though if you are epileptic, 'cause there's a scene towards the end that will definitely give you a fit! (I'm being sincere! I wouldn't joke about that!)<br/><br/>A great film, a landmark in horror and sci-fi films and it launched the career of Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver.<br/><br/>Basically, you can't fault this film.<br/><br/>Perfect 10!<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","In 1977, Star Wars and CE3K reminded everyone how much fun SF could be, freeing up the budgets of the major studios. Two years later, Ridley Scott showed us how good an SF story could be told without resorting to ""space opera."" It is impossible to speak of this movie with mentioning Scott, since the director's hand is so evident in every detail of this seminal masterpiece.<br/><br/>In his first major film, Scott used his artistic background to create a very believable, lived-in world. No brightly-lit ST:TNG  corridors of shiny plastic here..dark, noisy, wet corridors from which the monster could jump out with a BOO! And what a creature!<br/><br/>The back-story of the creature went to and fro during the production, but Scott had to cut most of the exposition to keep the tension line going..nice call. H.R. Giger's exquisitely hideous design was an instant classic, inspiring as much terror as the creature's modus operandi.<br/><br/>The cast is exceptional -  the only non-veteran actor was Sigourney Weaver, in her first major film. The rest were all accomplished actors long before this movie. Was this some bargain-hunting coup of the casting director, or a commitment to excellence? Don't tell me!<br/><br/>This film spawned a franchise of debatable importance, but more importantly, it paved the way for more serious SF work. Its success led Ridley Scott onto Blade Runner - another classic SF movie with the grunge feel of a nihilistic future."

"rogierr","Null","1","3","13 June 2001"," convincing space-opera as well as a character study
","Has this become an all-star cast because the movie is brilliant or is the movie so good because the actors are great?  I think both.  Seven (plus a hairy quadruped) tour-de-force performances make it a convincing space-opera as well as a fantastic character study.  I particularly like the interaction between Yaphet Kotto (Midnight Run, 1988) and Harry Dean Stanton (Paris Texas, 1984) as opportunistic engineers.  I saw this film every year in the past 15 years, and that will definitely continue for decades.  Since that first time I tend to compare every SF and every horror movie with this one, but just recently I realized that it's an unfair race against this horror-milestone.  Ridley Scott builds up the pace towards the end and doesn't spill his guts (at once) so you aren't able to take your eyes off the screen. <br/><br/>This has the most intellectual plot (and coolest plot-twists) of all four alien-films: one of the key elements (why do they wake up in the first place?) of the film is the moral dilemma faced by commercial corporations anywhere to sacrificing employees in order to make more money or to make less profits in order to serve humanity.  Strangely enough, the two SF masterpieces Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) made are also his only two intellectual achievements.<br/><br/>Here's one of the greatest movie scores of all time by Jerry Goldsmith (the Omen, Chinatown, L.A. Confidential), because it's subtle and instantly recognizable.  As is the art direction, which was not only flawlessly executed here by Les Dilley and Roger Christian, but could also not be surpassed by any SF-horror without computer animations until now, and by which this genre stands or falls.  No need to mention the concept artists. Derek Vanlint (cinematography) also puts his stamp upon the film very carefully.  The nerve-wrecking hand-held scenes are also used to make the all-time scariest theatrical trailer you've ever seen.  I hope there'll be no computer-animations in part five, for they could not compete with this art and are probably more expensive too.<br/><br/>Beware of Alien-wannabees like 'Pitch Black' and 'Leviathan' (entertaining though).  If you liked this you should not miss Aliens, which is more of an adrenalized war-movie but does NOT disappoint.<br/><br/>Why o why can't we vote 11 :("

"ary","Null","1","3","6 May 2000"," Terrifying
","It is difficult to believe that director Ridley Scott's frightening and terrifying film was made in the seventies. Alien still possesses an impressive vigor and strength, such as another classic that also seems so fresh and vivid, Deliverance, a powerful adventure about four common people who are hunted down by hillbillies in some river of Georgia. Alien places a crew of astronauts being threatened by an implacable alien that kills each one of them without mercy. The gigantic sceneries and the disturbing visual (the scene in which Kane - John Hurt - explores a cave has a terrific impact) were remarkable and brought innovation for movie making, because at the time, the vision that Hollywood had of space was bright and clean (Star Wars).This dark, tense visual helped to increase more fear and suspense to the story. Ridley Scott's direction is outstanding  - he develops his characters carefully, giving to every actor a chance to shine. Scott develops real ""characters"", and not fearless heroes, in a way this makes the people inside the theaters to identify themselves with the protagonists. Scott created memorable scenes,it's impossible to forget John Hurt's horrible, cruel death : alongside with Ned Beatty's rape in Deliverance, this scene is one of the most gruesome things ever putted on the screen.One of the greatest films of all time, I highly recommend Alien's DVD, Twentieth Century Fox made an outstanding job with it, adding extras, trailers, commentary and more. And don't forget to check Deliverance if you haven't seen it yet."

","One can not approach this film looking for mindless entertainment. I'm not claiming that it is thought-provoking or of great worth as profound social commentary, but what ""Alien"" *is* is a science-fiction thriller that demands your full attention and involvement.<br/><br/>There is almost nothing to criticise about this film. The actors are excellent, especially Sigourney Weaver (Ellen Ripley), Ian Holm (Ash), and Yaphet Kotto (Parker). The plot is tightly-written and extremely suspenseful, with more than enough surprises to pick things up when the pace slackens.<br/><br/>Speaking of pace, this *is* a slow film, but this is not to its detriment. It actually serves to heighten the tension - a particular highlight would be the final scene inside the shuttle.<br/><br/>See this film. Now. I'm not kidding."

","I realy like Alien and I've watched it many times. The film is something special and I rank it amongst the best ever made. There are a lot sci-fi movies being made that can be categorised as cartoonish, or cheapiah. But this movie has style and it is far from cartoonish.<br/><br/>The design of the ship is realistic and the attention is being paid to the ship's rules (quarentine rules and chain of command). The characters are also believable, whining about payment and the way things are going. Further more, Ridley Scott's directing is supurb and he created the movie as if we were there; This could be a real event in times to come, and in the Science fiction genre reality is rare.<br/><br/>The story is rather simple: Monster gets onboard and starts killing. But that isn't a negative thing. As the simple story creates the time to show details of life on a space-craft and makes you believe you are a watching real people in a real situation.<br/><br/>The actors are good and well casted, every scene is right and some of them are quite memorable, like the visit to the Alien ship, Kane's last supper and Mother's countdown.<br/><br/>This movie never gets boring and is a real treat. The sequels are also quite mentionable, especially Aliens, which is less stylish, but with more action.<br/><br/>Martijn Meijers"

The freaking director, Ridley Scott! Boring dialogue and characters.<br/><br/>Cafeteria scene - they're arguing about bonuses. 10 minutes to land the freaking ship. Do we need that? No.<br/><br/>Boring but functional cinematography. Audio sucked. Mix of dialogue/sound effects and music crap. Music was OK, nothing special.<br/><br/>Lighting is crap. After ship lands scene with Ian Holm/Ash/Robot, super white bright. Monitor shot of ship distorted and annoying.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver/Ripley confronts Ash/Robot about why he opened the door to let the contaminated astronauts into the spaceship. She's in charge when the captain is out of the ship, broke protocol. Painful stuff.<br/><br/>Acid on pencil scene.<br/><br/>Yaphet Kotto/Parker has a great idea that nobody listens to - ""freeze John Hurt/Kane till we get home"".<br/><br/>Hurt wakes up, nobody does another x-ray. Hurt chestbust in the cafeteria, disgusting, stupid. More props.<br/><br/>Harry Dean Stanton/Brett comes up with cow shock sticks to attack the alien. More props.<br/><br/>Cat in the locker scare! How did he get in there? Stanton searches for the cat (Cat Search I). Alien is now giant. How is that possible? No explanation, 1 foot to 10 feet?<br/><br/>Here's more stupidity: Water dripping from somewhere, maybe a cargo, who knows. Stanton washes his face like its fresh rain, it's more like a leaking pipe or sewer. Alien comes out - very cool. Props! Stanton is dead.<br/><br/>Here's another stupid prop/set: The Mother/Computer room. Round, lights.<br/><br/>No likable or detestable characters here. All ordinary boring nothing characters.<br/><br/>Tom Skerritt/Captain Dallas, the most boring characters here, right after Veronica Cartwright/Lambert. He is no captain Kirk. Kirk would save his ship before himself. Skerritt - ""Open the door, I don't care if we infect the whole crew and ship"". Skerritt is an OK actor. His character here and Skerritt's acting is crap. Skerritt is killed/or taken off screen.<br/><br/>Lambert at this point loses it and comes up with this films 2nd best idea, take the shuttle and get off the ship. Since the shuttle takes only 3, and there are 4 people left, the robot not discovered yet, they decide to kill the alien.<br/><br/>Ripley goes to the computer room/Mother and finds out that the mission is to bring the Alien specimen in at all cost, the crew is expendable. Fight ensues where Ash/Robot attacks Weaver. Parker and Lambert help Ripley and decapitate Ash. This is one of the most disgusting, milk everywhere, crap fight choreography ever. Even the props here suck! Fake head, fake robot body, fake dummy head burning. It just sucks.<br/><br/>Ripley is now looking for the cat (Cat Search II). Parker and Lambert Get killed. Parkers death was cool. Lambert just frozen, is killed off screen. OK.<br/><br/>More props. The self-destruct mechanism. Another User reviewer posed a question: Do all ship have self-destruct mechanisms? 10 minutes to detonation. She tries to get to the shuttle, alien blocking her path, she tries to deactivate the self-destruct. Oh, the suspense. She can't. Her and the cat are now onboard the shuttle and off just in time. Detonation time. We see 3 explosions. How is that possible? The death star only exploded once.<br/><br/>That would have been enough to end the movie. But, after Ripley put the cat to sleep, she sees the alien, somehow squeezed into under the control panels. She puts on a space-suite, decompresses the shuttle. We hear mumbling coming from Ripley as she is trying to open the door to the shuttle to dump the alien out. Mumbling! Alien is excremented out of the shuttle, then conveniently faces the rocket and is burned out into space. Before all that we get to see Ripley strip down to her ugly underwear.<br/><br/>This is not Sc-Fi/Horror. It is Sc-Fi, and Terror. Or just Terrible. Horror would entail supernatural like undead/Dracula.<br/><br/>The acting dialogue looks like they improvised and are all one takes - real crap.<br/><br/>You want to love this because the ""Alien"" looks cool and that you're a sc-fi fan and it's a ""classic"", fine. But, please do not insult the intelligence of the whole human race by claiming this is the greatest film ever, or the greatest sc-fi film ever. It's not. Not even close. Best part of the mess is the props and sets. The cinematography is minimum. Lighting is annoying. The acting/dialogue/characters sucks. I don't care if they're a bunch of space truckers, no ""company"" would allow these slobs on a spaceship. They spend about 5% of the time on story. 95% of this is props/sets. Better to watch it with the sound off and listen to Black Sabbath. Or watch something that is complete.<br/><br/>Best part, Matte painting, when John Hurt descends to the egg chamber was cool. props.<br/><br/>If you've never seen this before, maybe a C grade, 5 stars.<br/><br/>If you've seen it before, no more surprises, grade D, 3 stars.<br/><br/>I'm done with this. F, 1 star.<br/><br/>Check out Galaxina instead. At least that's a comedy."

","I've said this over and over, that I hate not liking classic movies. It's the whole ego thing, like I can't appreciate a good, classic movie, which isn't true. It's just that a good amount of classic movies aren't as good as they're hyped up to be. I feel that way for such movies as Halloween, The Meaning of Life, and other movies like that. Added to that list will be Alien. It's a slow, dreary, dark sci-fi saga that leads nowhere, and with just slightly better character development than most other horror movies, it's certainly nothing special, and completely undeserving of its classic status.<br/><br/>In the future, the space ship Nostromo, headed back to Earth, picks up a distress signal. The crew interprets it as an SOS and goes to investigate it. Besides Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, some other B-list actors here are Tom Skerritt (Dallas), Harry Dean Stanton (Brett), and Ian Holm (Ash). It turns out that an alien attaches itself to one of the crew members, therefore putting all of them in jeopardy.<br/><br/>I'm fine with Alien not really being an action movie, as I had expected. I just didn't expect it to be so doggone slow. Whenever something happens, it's played so subduedly (and without music, it seemed) that it almost seemed like nothing has happened. Often, when I'm watching a movie, if I start to get bored, I put the subtitles on so I have something else to do, also, taking away some of the boredom. They were on within about 10 minutes of starting it. And although I'm glad that we actually got to learn some of the characters' names, nothing really happened with them, they all sounded the same, etc., and that final twist with Ash was just plain stupid. It was unexpected, sure, but completely absurd and uncalled for. The sets were nice to look at, but did we really need to see them for two hours? There's more that could happen. The only worthwhile things in the whole movie were the alien itself and the infamous chestbursting scene.<br/><br/>The ending scene also came out of nowhere, making the movie go on for even longer than it should have. I mean, come on, why? We've endured 105 minutes of this, why add 10 more on? I can see how Weaver could be made a star from this movie, although she wasn't very good. In fact, none were. But what else can be expected from the vastly overrated Alien, a boring, slow sci-fi movie whose only qualities are its sparse special effects and its tagline?<br/><br/>My rating: 4/10<br/><br/>Rated R for sci-fi violence/gore and language."

","In an age of interstellar space travel, does one really want to take a job that requires investigating when a signal is picked somewhere in the ether? Hell, it could be a warning, an SOS, or anything!<br/><br/>Such is the contractual lot of the crew of Nostromo, a hulking merchant spaceship returning to Earth with a load of planetary ore. It isn't long before a hideous space creature gains entry to the mother ship, because it's clinging to a crew member's face. Against her better judgment, and under peer pressure, commander of some sort Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) chucks the usual quarantine rules. After all, they can't leave their seriously wounded buddy on a godforsaken exoplanet. Or could they? Ripley's a tough sort and prefers that they do. When she's overruled, you know it's not good.<br/><br/>In the wake of knock-offs that followed it -- 2017's ""Life"" comes to mind -- 'Alien' doesn't seem that original today. Sure, the space fiend is hideous, dripping with goo, and murderously quick. I found it only mildly scary. Yet the movie does generate some suspense aboard ship, with its close quarters and dark corners.<br/><br/>There's no question the creature startles when it bursts from the gut of the sticken crew member, in a perverse twist on Caesarian birth. However, its later attacks seem predictable. Although it IS creepy when Ripley finds the beast has stowed away aboard her escape shuttle.

"daryahorenko","10","1","4","21 May 2018"," As close to perfect as movies get
","Alien is one of my favorite movies. In fact, it might even be my #1. There's three movies that are pretty much tied for my #1 spot and Alien is one of them and not just because I'm a fan of science fiction and science fiction horror. This might be THE best science fiction movie ever.<br/><br/>This is a very unique movie and I can't really compare it to any movie outside the Alien franchise. The idea of an alien monster growing inside your body, planted there by what they call a facehugger that has acid blood that attaches itself to your face after jumping out of a giant egg-like spore is so unique and fascinating. I'll get back to that, but for now let's analize some the other elements of the movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography of this movie is amazing. The lighting is flawless. When they're exploring the ship that sent the distress signal it might be too dark to see things clearly, but it makes for a realistic setting because the only light in this location is coming from thr crew's lamps. The pseudo-sexual imagery on the walls of said ship adds a creepy feeling to the scene. But the truly fascinating ship is the one our crew is using to return to earth, especially the inside looks great and it looks like a real environment that people actually live in. It looks so polished but used up at the same time. The editing in this movie is great as well, there's so many times we cut to the next shot at the perfect time, which basically happens throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch, especially the performance by Sigourney Weaver deserves a lot of praise. There's not a single dull moment of acting, not one. I also really like the characters. At first I thought the subplot that Ash is a robot wasn't really necessary, but his ""death scene"" made for a very scary moment and his last lines gave a lot more depth to his character. I also like the fact that all of the characters are individual people and not just ""the team"", which leads to several argument scenes that I really like and you always side with Ripley, because she's the reasonable one who tries to keep everyone safe. What I like most about Ripley is that she's highly aware of her responsibilities and that she's fearless. Even though Alien is the superior movie by a tidbit, she's even better in Aliens.<br/><br/>I said I'd get back to the spores, facehuggers and xenomorphs and I am getting back to them right now. Each of these creatures, and they get unveiled in the order I just named them is more mysterious and menacing than the previous one. The spores, especially with their slimy inside are gross in a great way and intriguing, so you understand why Kane is so curious about it and touches one of them. The facehugger is menacing. We're stuck with it for a considerable time of the movie and it makes us as the viewers concerned with the characters, especially with Kane. Its design is awesome and it works well as a ""character"" because it's an unknown entity to our human characters. I think that the fact that it has acid blood was added in order to fix the plothole that the crew could just kill it, but it doesn't come off that way because it makes the facehugger even more creepy and gross and because it turns the facehugger into an actual dangerous object. But the best creature in this movie is the xenomorph. That thing is so perfect! The way it gives birth is disturbing, it's an incredible antagonist, and obviously the xenomorph doesn't have a single line, but considering that it's one of the best antagonists to ever be put on screen without saying a single line just shows how well it works. The design is hands down without a doubt the best Alien design I've ever seen in a movie, it looks incredibly unique, slimy and most of all, extremely fear-inducing, menacing and SCARY. Speaking about scary, the first scene where we see the xenomorph emerging from Kane is scary as hell, even though the xenomorph is just a baby in that scene, even though it only makes two or three sounds and even though we only see it for a few seconds until it disappears. The next time we see it it's grown to its full scale and the scene is scary, too, and again, we only see it for a couple of seconds, later we get one very good shot of it that lasts less than a second. The fact that the xenomorph is hardly in the movie creates so much suspense and it keeps us waiting for the big reveal. All of those amazing short scenes and I didn't get into all of them build up to the finale which I absolutely love. The score highlights this incredibly suspenseful movie even more. <br/><br/>This is a have-to-see movie, check it out as soon as possible if you haven't!"
"pabloxmarcel","9","1","4","2 May 2018"," Who brings a cat aboard a Spacecraft?
","The hiring manager for the Nostromo Project should be shot. What I see is a crew with no apparent training whatsoever in important interplanetary mission aboard 19th century spacecraft. 
The spacecraft uses medieval technology such as incandescent light bulbs, a robot filled with milk, and harpoon guns. Ok, it was 1979, but they should have invented a different kind of lighting, a different kind of robot, and a different kind of gun. A Spaceship is supposed to be advanced, not to mimic Steam-Powered machinery draped in flexible steel conduit. On the positive side, I kind of dig the vintage buttons, controls and gages. In addition, the headsets are cool. I would wear one of those at work. 
What kind of Law applies in outer space? I assume that US Law applies aboard US Spacecraft. The crew made sure that every single safety standard was violated. I don't know the details of the contracts but I suspect there was a breach at some point and the crew member families should not be compensated or at best, partially compensated. For example, 'Professor' Dallas go on to inspect a suspected acid leak without wearing safety glasses. The test procedure consist of using a probe (pen) touch the acid with the probe, and then, give back the probe to his purported owner. It seems to me that everybody acted on their instincts and under some perspective they behaved like primitive creatures. Wearing a headbands doesn't make you tougher, and smoking does not make you cool. Humans should be an example of civilized behavior and I think the Alien got a very bad first impression about us. 
Lastly, the movie title is wrong or is missing something. The Alien should take the name of the planet she was born in."
"jmvscotland","9","1","4","25 April 2018"," Still a very fine movie despite some minor annoyances that were always present
","This movie ""Alien"" is certainly one of my very favourite movies. I am quite serious when I say I have just finished watching it for probably the 20th time. This most recently viewing was prompted by my having watched ""Prometheus"" a couple of days ago. I was interested to see ""Alien"" yet again because of the way Prometheus put the earlier movie into context. I must add my view that, despite the popularity of the whole Alien set of movies, the original Alien from 1979 is still the only one that is worth the time it takes to watch it. All of the sequels were crap in my opinion.<br/><br/>I showed Alien to my younger wife a few years ago and I have to say she was underwhelmed, she says because of the unsophisticated special effects compared to those in many modern movies. True enough.<br/><br/>There are also some issues with the movie that ever so slightly detract from even my enjoyment of it.<br/><br/>I am a cat person but why for example would anyone blowing up a space ship with ten minutes to organize everything spend at least half of that time searching for the bloody cat? I found myself yelling at Ripley to forget the cat.<br/><br/>And why didn't Ripley close the door to the escape pod when she went looking for the cat? Unless of course the Alien was able to open the hatch to the escape pod so he/she could surprise Ripley later?<br/><br/>And there is one major good in my opinion. The final 10 minute countdown from setting the auto destruct function to operate is in fact only 8 minutes and 20 seconds until the actual detonation. If anyone wants to check this, I'm talking about the Director's cut, not the original 1979 theatrical release of the movie. Is it too much to ask for a real-time countdown in such a situation? I don't think so.<br/><br/>These are only small niggles and don't greatly affect my respect for or continuing enjoyment of the movie that Alien is still and has always been. It has survived the nearly 40 years since it was made much better than many other movies from around that time. It is still a very fine movie indeed and I will probably watch it yet again in a year or two."

"tarifah-23-83670","5","1","4","10 June 2014"," Alien 1979, Ridley Scott
","Alien is a British film from 1979. It's genre is both science fiction and horror and it takes about two hours. The movie Alien stars, Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto.<br/><br/>The story takes place in 2122. A spaceship travels to planet Earth, loaded with ore. There are seven people present on the spaceship which are: Dallas, Ash, Kane, Parker Brett and two women. <br/><br/>The film starts with a signal being sent out by another planet to the spaceship. The spaceship has an advanced computer on board which they call the Mother. The Mother reacts to the signal of the unknown planet after which the spaceship changes course towards the planet. The members of the spaceship land on the planet and start investigating. They find an old crashed spaceship and enter it. Firstly they find a pilot's dead body. After that, they find eggs of which one cracks. A strange organism comes out and attacks one of the spaceship members, Kane. Kane is unconscious and the other spaceship members bring him back to their own spaceship. The strange organism sucked itself to the face of Kane. The others try to get it off and the organism started to produce a certain fluid which creates holes in the spaceship. They leave the room to look at how bad the damage is, and when they come back the organism has strangely disappeared. Kane came back to conscious and cannot remember anything. They start looking for the organism and find it dead on the ground. <br/><br/>In the evening when the group members are having dinner, Kane becomes ill and another strange organism, with a tail this time, comes out of his chest. The organism flees and the spaceship members start looking for the organism. They find its skin and it looked like it had melted. Brett finds the organism which had changed since the last time they saw it coming out of Kane's chest. It became bigger, the tail became sharp, and got very large teeth and a stabbing tongue. The creature kills Brett immediately. Dallas comes up with the idea to use a flame thrower to drive away the creature back in to space. While Dallas is on his mission, the others hear him scream, Dallas seems to have been disappeared.<br/><br/>The transport company of the spaceship orders the members of the spaceship not to kill the creature but to catch it for investigation. Ash starts attacking Ripley when he hears about this dangerous request. Parker then attacks Ash to protect Ripley after which Ash turns out to be a robot. The rest of the spaceship members destroy him/it, and want to leave the spaceship with the backup capsule. Before they leave, they first have to search for coolant for the shuttle and the cat they lost in the beginning. When Ripley and Jones start searching for the cat and the rest for the coolant, Ripley hears the others scream. When Ripley and Jones run towards the screaming but the others are already killed. Ripley and Jones decide to leave to the backup capsule and blow up the spaceship. When the spaceship is blown up and Jones and Ripley are in the backup capsule, they find out the creature is inside the backup capsule. Ripley succeeds in getting it out. Finally they can start the cryosleep, and they start waiting for another spaceship to find them<br/><br/>General opinion We share the opinion that the movie 'Alien' is a bit old-fashioned and outdated. Nowadays we are able to create spectacular effects in movies which make horror/science-fiction movies very realistic and frightening. Since this movie is produced in 1979, the techniques and special effects used to create drama are not very impressive to us. We do understand that people would find it impressive at that time because they weren't used to other techniques yet. What is positive about the movie is that right from the beginning there is a suspicion of something scary to happen. The tension is built up slowly, so the scary moments do not come all out of nowhere. The camera-work of the movie helps the tension being built up. By filming from certain angles, certain objects look bigger and more scary. By very fast camera movements the tension also increases. The dark setting of the movie also adds to a scary atmosphere of the horror movie. <br/><br/>Analysis and detailed opinion The first part of the movie where they enter the spaceship and travel was quite boring and extensive. However the part where an unknown creature appeared was very shocking and unexpected, but we did like the fact that something finally happened. The scene in the movie where the creature came out of Kane's chest was one of the scariest parts of the movie because it was unpleasant to look at. A very unexpected twist to the story is when it turns out that Ash is a robot, nobody saw this coming. For us, it was a bit unnecessary because it does not add anything to the story besides drama. The part where the spaceship members are being killed is shocking and a bit disgusting. The end where Ripley and Jones succeed in leaving the spaceship without the creature is a quite ''happy'' ending and gives us a good closure. Although not everyone has survived, it is a good ending.<br/><br/>Conclusion and opinion Alien is an intense movie with lots of suspense. Most people refer to the movie as being one of the classiest movies in its genre. We do not quite agree with that opinion because of the information above about the old-fashioned atmosphere of the movie. Not everyone would like this movie because of the dark setting, which is another factor why we disliked this movie. When watching the movie, you should take into account that it may contain scary en frightening images, which not everyone can handle."
"artistgp","7","1","4","9 November 2012"," Not quite what I remembered
","I saw Alien as a kid and I recalled it being extremely scary. Many years have gone by and I recently watched it again. It fell short of my memories.<br/><br/>It's not that it isn't a good film. It's ""fine."" The main issue I have is that the characters are 99% hollow. They have absolutely no development, so why would we care if they live or die? The only people we get to know at all are the two mechanics on board. They complain back and forth with each other about how many shares they are getting, etc. Other than that we don't know or care anything about anyone else. I'm not even sure that we know what jobs most of the other crew members have.<br/><br/>Also, that alien sure as heck did grow fast. It went from the size of a squirrel to the scale of a large man in like 30 minutes. And that was without eating anything. And by the way, Ash said he was ordered to bring the species back and that the crew was expendable. Why in the world didn't he just freeze the facehugger while it was on the random crew member's face? The mechanic even suggested it.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's not a bad movie it's just not very extra special. Scott seems (as usual) obsessed with sets and not much else (for another example watch Blade Runner or Prometheus)."

","Date: 25 May <br/><br/>-First Time Watch- <br/><br/>After months of deliberating if I should watch Alien, last night I finally did. I prepared myself to be scared like crazy. I wasn't. After watching the movie, I came to the conclusion that the sequel, done by James Cameron, was much more suspenseful and scary then the first. That's not the only reason why I picked the sequel over the original. The original was short and there was less then an hour of the alien being around and attacking people. The rest was the crew discussing what the face sucker was. In the sequel, the alien was in more then half the movie. Suspense in the first was there but it was even worse in the sequel. Now, would my opinion be different if I had watched the original first? I think so. The problem I had was knowing what the alien does and how it attacks it's victims. Overall, though, the film was very good and still enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>8/10"
"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","4","16 November 2009"," Alfred Hitchcock established the power of horror with ""Psycho""; Ridley Scott revitalized it with ""Alien""
","The motion picture that was the primer in setting off the explosion of popularity and influence in the horror genre was, hands down, Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" Down the road, with rip-off after rip-off forming a chain, the horror and science-fiction genres—now a popular combo—seemed to dwindle in effectiveness. That's when Ridley Scott's visionary masterpiece ""Alien"" reinforced it.<br/><br/>The reason why ""Alien"" worked so well and why it still works today is not because the slimy insect-like creature can jump out and scare you or because the film's gruesome scenes that twist your stomach into a knot, but because it's art. It's a bittersweet work of art. Bitter because first viewing will leave you feeling really harrowed. Sweet because it's absolutely absorbing storytelling. ""Alien"" is a first-class example of film-making that goes beyond special effects and set design to create horror.<br/><br/>The premise is both simple and promising. Simple ideas are oftentimes the best ones. In an unspecified time in the future, a cargo ship transporting mineral oil is drawn off-course by an S.O.S. signal on a remote, uninhabited planetoid. The crew investigates and unwillingly brings back onboard with them a parasitic organism that begins to grow and change and before long, escapes and starts to pick the crew off one by one.<br/><br/>""Alien"" is not only a great movie to experience, but a great one to look at. The whole film from start to finish is eye candy. The art-direction and special effects are absolutely fantastic even by today's standards. The cinematography is very much like outer space itself—dark in most spaces, but with bold embodiments of light and contrast spaced throughout the misc en scene. The spaceship travelling through the endlessness of the universe reminds us of similar shots from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a film this movie obviously is referencing visually. The alien, depending on its metamorphic stage is portrayed using animatronics or a man in a suit and although these effects can be outdone visually by a computer now, they cannot be outdone in terms of impact, for when the creature is in the same shot with the actors, the fear is genuine, because it's not something painted on the screen. It's really there.<br/><br/>Something that the makers of the travesty ""AVPR: Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem"" should have realized when they were making the branch-off to this film was that a good horror movie goes beyond blood and gore and off-putting images. ""Alien"" does boast really terrifying iconic horror images, but to a certain extent, that's not what it's about. It's about memorable characters such as Sigourney Weaver's career-launching portrayal of Ripley, special effects used a service to the motion picture entire, and the cemented lesson to any audience member that film-making is in essence, storytelling and it should be done well.<br/><br/>I grew up knowing Ridley Scott's director's cut of this film, in which he sliced out a few moments of the 1979 theatrical release and instilled some new footage that was before left on the cutting room shelves. Recently I saw the original theatrical version. Comparing the two, the director's cut is slightly better, but the theatrical version is sheer magnificence on its own. In either version, ""Alien"" and its first sequel, ""Aliens"", are first-class examples of brilliant film-making. It is harrowing, it is disgusting, it is gut-wrenching, but it surprisingly enough enthralls us as its puts us in a cold sweat. It takes genius to do that. Hitchcock did it with ""Psycho."" Ridley Scott did it with ""Alien."" Of these two movies, which do I prefer personally? Please don't ask. I couldn't possibly pick one over the other."

If you haven't then why not. this is one of those films that must be seen and will always be part of our film history.<br/><br/>I like it because of the way it is shot. It is claustrophobic, the scenes in the general parts of the spaceship give a feeling that these people are living on top of each other and that creates stress and tension.<br/><br/>The lighting is cold, fluorescent and sometimes over dazzling. this also creates a feeling of high anxiety.<br/><br/>add to this the Alien, a double crossing robot and a ship that is about to blow up and you have great film."

","I saw this movie a few months ago. It was very interesting. It's a movie that's worth watching. I'm not sure about the sequels. I know Aliens is supposed to be better though. The first one was good enough for a sequel. (Unlike some horror movies where the whole idea was spent in the first movie) At first the characters are just exploring outer space, but soon afterwords they encounter an alien that is trying to take over the ship. They must escape from the spaceship before its too late. The Alien fights them every step of the way. This movie was a little slow paced, but still well made. I thought the effects were great for the Alien. This movie also has one of the most suspenseful/terrifying scenes of horror. It would really be up there."
"tburke85","8","1","4","15 June 2009"," Alien A Solid Sci-Fi Film With Some Flaws
","Alien is a solid sci-fi film with some flaws but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Director Ridley Scott shows his talent as a filmmaker in Alien just like he has for all his movies some of which weren't as good as others. Sigourney Weaver is the stand out in the cast of course as Ripley the tough heroine who finds herself in one dangerous situation after another when a nightmarish alien beast begins to pick off her crew members on board a mining ship in deep space. Tom Skerritt is good as Dallas but he lacks screen time because his role is cut rather short. The rest of the cast are solid in their roles including Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet Kotto but most of them like Skerriit aren't really in that much. The special effects are amazing especially for that time and the alien looks terrifying like something out of your worst nightmares. The movie did a claustrophobic feel because of the confined space the characters were in because of the ship and there was a decent amount of suspense. The movie was a little slow in the beginning but once things kicked into high gear suspense wise it moves at a steady pace from there. Despite some flaws Alien is still an entertaining sci-fi horror thriller with suspense, great special effects, gruesome deaths, a scary alien villain, and exceptional performances by the cast especially Weaver who make it worth the time to watch."
"tasha1919","10","1","4","29 August 2006"," Didn't catch the Lambert killing
","I saw this on TV the first time and taped it. I saw it and I could'nt believe the alien birth was shown on TV. I had heard about it but I figured because the way people described it that it wouldn't make it on TV. I have seen the actual video movie too but after TV. I did notice the sound of Lambert being killed didn't make it on TV because the sound of her screams shocked me when I saw the unedited video. I was surprised when I saw the video. I was like..where did that come from? I looked at my TV tape again and the sound is taken out but you hear all the other noises of the ship in place of her screams. Also on my TV tape you don't see the alien hand go up Lambert's leg. You see her standing there looking scared though. It is not on TV at all...at least the station I taped it off of. At the point the hand is supposed to go up her leg on TV you can tell it cuts away because the sound, voices and music makes a blip sound like something was cut I thought maybe they just cut a bloody scene or something. It makes me think the intent was to make you think she was raped by the alien. But the only reason I believe that is because it was cut out of TV. Why else would a sound be cut? No blood or anything in that scene. You don't even see it. You just hear it and I guess that was too much for TV. But if not for TV cutting it out, I would have thought she was killed the same way as everyone else. After reading a review here I watched the real version again and it is real evident she was killed differently than the rest of the crew with that sound you hear."
"Hitchcoc","8","1","4","22 March 2006"," You Don't Want to Go There
","This is the ultimate fright fest. From the planet these junk dealers come to, to the appearance of the monster and subsequent events, this is one wild ride. First of all, there is a bleakness and an eeriness. These people are on a salvage mission, trying to bring things back to sell. They have been victimized by their own bosses. When they go down to the planet, they have not been told what lies there. There is a darkness to everything. It isn't the romantic explorer thing of a Star Trek or the use of a sophisticated starship. This is a big space barge. When the man is brought back from the surface with that thing on his face, we know that there is something coming. The scene following is one of the most startling and disgusting I've ever seen (in a positive way). The alien is a true threat, dripping corrosive venom and poison blood, terrorizing the ship, leaving one person to combat it. If there is a more claustrophobic, terrifying movie than this, I'd like to know what it is. The other Alien movies don't quite make the grade because they draw on way too much of the same thing and it seems forced."
"DavidSim240183","10","1","4","17 March 2006"," Quite simply one of the finest horror films ever made
","With all the science-fiction/horror films released over the years, there has been none more imitated or alluded to than Alien. A landmark film for the way it effortlessly combined the genres of science-fiction/horror, this is that rarity where everything about it works, and it constantly keeps surprising you right up until the very end. <br/><br/>Ridley Scott's direction is flawless. With the commercial tug ship Nostromo, he has crafted a biomechanical world that manages the impossible task of merging the biological with the technological. The attention to detail is marvellous. There is so much to see. Repeated viewing is essential to take in the sheer amount of minute details.<br/><br/>There is no need to go into specifics concerning the plot. You'd have to have been living under a rock not to know. Alien gets loose on ship, kills the crew one by one. That description doesn't even begin to do Alien justice. That's a synopsis more fitting for the countless copycats, who are more concerned with springing the next shock tactic. Alien does that too, but also generates a palpable atmosphere of tension and menace.<br/><br/>What exactly is it about Alien that has it held in such high regard? Is it the actors? The alien itself? There may never be an adequate explanation. But I think it must be that it avoids all the obvious pitfalls films like this are wont to do. Clichés are continually kept at bay, and the actors are a fine ensemble cast, unlike the hopeless, simpering teenagers you find in the copycats.<br/><br/>This was the film where Sigourney Weaver made her mark as an actress, even though she is accorded second billing to Tom Skerrit as Captain Dallas. This is a brilliant manoeuvre, because you're half expecting him to be the hero of the piece, only for Dallas to get killed halfway through.<br/><br/>It is exactly that type of deceptive simplicity that ranks it so highly in my book. Every time you've got Alien figured out, you're wrong. This film is filled with surprises. One after another. Maybe the greatest of all that the one who finally kills the alien is a woman. Weaver is perfectly cast as Ellen Ripley. A woman who is tough, resourceful, but still balances it with a healthy dollop of fear for her life.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is filled capably by some truly talented actors. John Hurt as the unfortunate Kane, Yaphet Kotto as the argumentative Parker, Ian Holm as the sinister Ash, Harry Dean Stanton as Brett and Veronica Cartwright as Lambert.<br/><br/>All of these actors have something to offer. They're not just shoe-horned in to take up time before they get bumped off. Their close encounters all end the same way, but it's always interesting to see how it will lead up to that.<br/><br/>In regards to the alien itself, the design work by H.R. Giger is astounding. Although the alien is kept in semi-darkness (a brilliant move!) when we do get glimpses of it, it seems an astonishing amalgamation of metal, razor sharp teeth and sexual subtext all in one body. It is hard to imagine anywhere else in other films an alien creature as unique in design as this one.<br/><br/>Another thing of constant interest is the continual evolution of the alien creature throughout. Beginning with an egg, where a hand-like parasite attaches itself to Kane, then to the eventual hatching of the alien that almost looks like a penis (sexual metaphor again!) to then grow in size and strength with each person killed, the alien is like a chameleon that changes its form to whatever the story requires, blending in seamlessly with the Nostromo itself.<br/><br/>The alien is an ever-present menace. Stalking it's prey in dark corridors and shadowy passages. The audience is never completely certain where the alien may be hiding, even though we know it's always nearby. When it does appear, because it resembles the Nostromo so much, it's almost as if the ship itself comes alive. It's a frightening thing to watch. And it never fails to disturb.<br/><br/>Alien's greatest trump card may be the fact that it knows how to build suspense. Roger Ebert summed it up quite nicely: ""One of the greatest strengths of Alien is its pacing. It takes its time. It waits. It allows silences.""<br/><br/>All of this is certainly true. I don't think I've ever seen a horror film that devotes as much time to the build up of suspense as this one does. Horror films nowadays jump right to the killing. Not so with Alien. It's almost an hour before the alien makes it's grand appearance in the infamous mess hall scene. But the fact that it waits for as long as it does makes the final carnage on the Nostromo all the more gratifying, and unbearable.<br/><br/>The motives of the alien itself are thankfully never made clear. It adds to it's menace. Ash muses: ""A perfect organism. It's structural perfection is matched only by it's hostility. No conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.""<br/><br/>That statement only intensifies the frightening nature of the alien. It seems to kill for pure malice and sheer pleasure. It seems to be grinning when killing Parker and Brett. And when Lambert is killed, we never get to see that. Only hear her high pitched screams. The final image of the alien's tail moving between her legs. Murderous rape perhaps?<br/><br/>The final showdown between Ripley and the alien is an explosive finale within the cramped confines of a life raft. Alien is a true nail-biter right up to the very end.<br/><br/>Out of all the sequels, Aliens was the only one I enjoyed on the same level. It is a film as equally brilliant as this one. But when it comes to frightening intensity and creating a tangible mood of menace, there are none more effective than the exceptional and darkly beautiful Alien."
"jofitz27","10","1","4","19 May 2005"," A terrifying, involving and memorable masterpiece
","Alien is classic for a few reasons. For one: it is a rare beast, so emotionally and incredibly involving that when you stop watching it you have to emerge from the world you were in. Two: it defined the genre, a gory space horror that remains shocking today. And three: it is one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>We know little about the Nostromo when it first appears in that isolated place called space: only that it has 7 passengers and is heading towards earth. We are soon introduced to the characters, already on a mission as they receive a distress call from an unknown planet. A few are reluctant to go, but they are forced to (mainly because of the incredibly dominating Ash) unaware of the horror that awaits them...<br/><br/>I guess human instinct and interest must have got the best of them, because instead of instantly fleeing and at the sight of a beast that was once alive (that stands an enormous hight) they enter it. Then do they flee? No. They go deeper. And deeper.<br/><br/>Squeamish people may very well want to keep what I say in mind. There is some shocking, jumpy stuff here, making even the hardest jump and genuinely fear for the lives of these fictional characters, despite their evident stupidity. A pillow may be handy nearby.<br/><br/>Though we don't know why at the time, Ash develops a huge interest in these aliens, and seems completely intent on keeping them alive, unaware of the immense danger it will lead these passengers to live through. Despite having a face-hugger strapped across his face Kane (John Hurt) is let through without being bacteria-free checked, endangering the others more than himself. The chest burster scene will prove my point.<br/><br/>The thing is, though this may not seem incredible, there just isn't a lot wrong with it. The script, acting and storyline are brilliant, and the tension is unbelievable and, nearing the end, unbearable. The constant feeling of fear twists in the pit of your stomach, and though the outcome may be slightly evident, you can't help feeling genuine fear and sorrow for these people and hope for their survival.<br/><br/>Along with that, it ask interesting political questions, aimed at government agencies and other undercover special forces. I wish not to reveal these (mainly for public enjoyment) but keep an ear close and handy and you will see what I mean. It is both daring and intelligent.<br/><br/>Sigourny Weaver (playing Ripley) is incredible, her performance completely real and believable. This film is not isolated like the characters stuck in it: this is a bold, in your face film that demands seeing. A masterpiece of modern (and old) cinema.<br/><br/>**** out of **** (4 out of 4)"

To the Aliens, the human race is expendable. And to the company that is trying to use the Aliens as Bio-Weapons we are expendable. NOW THAT'S SCARY! But this movie isn't just about a hideous Alien stowaway on the rampage, it's about Ellen Ripley and her struggle to destroy the Alien race forever. . . If you haven't seen this movie, then I strongly advise you pick it up at your local video store. Then I promise everyone will hear you scream!"

","What can I say that has not already been said. We live on a violent planet in a violent universe. That said, the director extended that desperate aggression out into the universe. It is a lonely place, a violent place, where even human life is cheap and a species could be extinguished without guilt. Eventually all moral issues were put aside and the true horror of base animal survival took over. It was frail humanity versus a brutal universe in the form of an alien species that had no other urge but to feed and breed. Like in Jaws we saw so little of the creature that our imaginations took over and created a world far worse that any that could be put on screen. In a way to put in on screen is to exorcise the demon and face the tangible fear. But to keep it in the shadows was brilliant. I can think of no better horror movie of this kind."
"ravenskyfire","10","1","4","4 May 2005"," 'Alien' is a must see...
","As a fan of old-school horror movies that don't use tons of computer animation this movie still scores high on my list of 'must see' after 25 years. 'Alien' has it all, a deadly monster who gestates inside a living host, a spaceship full of interesting characters that inevitably become fodder for the scary beast,an evil android who is programed to protect the monster at the expense of the crew, and a heroein who kills the monster and saves herself and her cat at the end of the movie. The concept was top-notch, the Alien was a new innovative movie monster that terrified viewers from all over the world, the script was original and innovative, and Ridley Scott was absolutely brilliant as the director (although i do have to say that this movie is one of his shining moments in his career, 1492-A Conquest in Paradise really sucked, lol). Although i was only 7 years old when this movie came out, i remember watching the trailers on television and really wanting to see it which i finally did when our household owned it's first VCR, it was great and i still get those chills up my spine whenever i throw it in the DVD player, it's truly a scary movie and dang, they made Sigourney Weaver look so flip-pin' hot!!! definitely a 10 outa 10 in my book...."
"MatBrewster","10","1","4","3 May 2005"," A Beautiful Start to a Classic Series
","Each film in the Alien quadrilogy has differed from each other. It has helped that they each had a distinctive and imaginative director. Ridley Scott created a slow, tension filled science fiction epic. James Cameron pumped it full of adrenaline and made an action packed masterpiece. David Fincher cut his teeth on the Alien3 by turning the action into a dark, mostly muddled mess. Jean-Pierre Jeunet tried to rescue the franchise, but had no story to work with. Like the Star Wars movies what we're left with is a couple of top notch flicks and a few others that while showing a few moments of visual brilliance leave ultimately leave the series limp.<br/><br/>But my review is not of the series as a whole, but on the movie that started it all. In considering the franchise it is sometimes forgotten that Alien never started out as a quadrilogy. There was only this one movie about a group of average workers sent to capture a monster. Scott does a superb job of creating suspense. It is some 30 minutes into the picture before we actually see an Alien. And even then the action is slow to evolve. For the audience this creates a great amount of tension. Even for those who have never seen an Alien movie, the creature has so penetrated our popular culture that everyone knows it's not an ET kind of alien. So, while watching it we know that the alien is creeping around some corner just waiting to devour the characters. And yet we hardly see the alien. We not only don't get to see any alien through a third of the film, but when the alien does come out and begin its slaughter, we only catch glimpses of the creature itself. It is seen in the dark creeping in a corner, or in a flash as it jumps out of the darkness to attack. Scott, instead, uses shots of the crew to show the fear in their eyes, before their destruction, rather than show the creature in action. There are only one or two moments where the audience sees the alien in full figure, and those last only a short time. Even then the alien does not move, never allowing us to see it kill. This stroke serves to scare the audience even more. For how many times have we seen a movies monster in action only to laugh at its poor design? The movie oozes with atmosphere. The cinematography is dark and shadowy. The ship's quarters are enclosed and tight, creating claustrophobic spaces in which to encounter the Alien. Then there is HR Giger's amazing design. His designs of the alien ship and the alien are absolutely perfect. The ship seems to slither and move as if it's alive. There are curves, ridges and smooth edges as on the alien itself. All of which creates an atmosphere, and mood that stimulates the horror to come.<br/><br/>All of the effects shot were done in without the use of CGI. Generally they still hold their ground. Sure, the glimpses we get of the alien standing look like a man in a rubber suit. But overall the effects look great. This is a testament to the genius of Giger. My main complaint is with MOTHER. Like other science fiction films the crew's ship, the Nostromo, has its brains in a giant computer. Here, MOTHER is housed in an inner room of the ship and only accessible by the ships captain. We see her captain, Dallas (Tom Skerritt) go to visit MOTHER for a ""your eyes only"" deal. Why a commercial ship needs this type of security is never mentioned. Mother turns out to be a Star Trekesque computer equipped with blinking lights and a faint whirring sound. All of this is so that the Dallas can sit down to a DOS prompt and ask silly questions like ""What's the story, Mother?"" They should have gone with a more 2001 approach and have the crew be able to actually speak to MOTHER.<br/><br/>All of the characters are very well acted and fleshed out. Each character is given their own personality and is fully realized. There is a nice scene in which the crew is searching for the recently unsucking face sucker has disappeared. Ripley (Signorney Weaver) has left the door open and Ash (Ian Holm) moves to shut it so the alien won't escape. The look Ash gives as he is doing this is incredible. Ash and Ripley have previously had a bit of a fight and you can see the anger and irritation at Ripley perfectly in Ash's face.<br/><br/>Signorney Weaver plays Ripley beautifully. This is a female action star that is sexy, but doesn't pander her sexuality (though they did manage to get her in her underwear.) She is tough as nails and intelligent. And Weaver plays her perfectly.<br/><br/>Alien is arguably the best in one of the most successful series in film history. It is also one of the best science fiction films Hollywood has ever made."

If you blink you'll miss your chance to get at least one look at the well-constructed creature. Ridley Scott does this story so well that it almost seems like this is real like.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that this movie came out two years after Star Wars, where aliens were negotiating and surprisingly human-like beings.

","It's amazing how more than 25 five years (hell, I'm 25) after its release, Alien still reigns as a major landmark in film making, especially in the science fiction and horror genres. Any new film that comes out that features either space ships, or monsters, or both, will be compared to Alien. And 99 times out of 100, it will fall short.<br/><br/>Maybe where Alien succeeds and most fail is at building a sense of tension that is almost unbearable at times. Ridley Scott explores the desolation of space, bringing it into the space ships and making it nearly a character in the film. Add to that a monster that is scarcely seen throughout the movie (remember that old rule in horror, that says that the less you see it, the scarier it is?), and you have a masterpiece that refuses to get old."

Am I the only one who questions why there was gravity in space? I'll assume that it takes place in the future. But when they arrive on another planet, they walk perfectly.

","ALIEN (1979) is an overrated movie....it's success is based on gimmicks which make it a successful video game experience, packed with unending lights flashing and sudden explosions and scary, slimy teeth (the monster has two sets of teeth...one inside of another...the inside set jumps out of the outer set).<br/><br/>The science isn't detailed or knowledgeable. <br/><br/>The movie simply uses a doubtful damp, dank basement type spaceship filled with wet, unattractive pipes on all walls and ceilings to tell a ""Curse Of The Cat People"" type story where the scary monster is mostly unseen, in the shadows, and lurking, lurking, lurking, while the actors get more and more nervous...until the monster pounces!<br/><br/>""B"" movie stuff! Clever and gimmicky...but great art, it's not.<br/><br/>The characters are a set of unlikely and predictably uncooperative (with each other) people similar to WWII ""B"" movies where the bomber planes include representatives of various ethnic groups to sell the war effort to every group which buys tickets to the movies...regardless of how unlikely the association of these groups may be in real life.<br/><br/>The hero of the movie is a taller than average actress (Sigorney Weaver...5'10"") whose body language is aggressive and pushy....radical feminism was big in 1979, and girls taking over jobs guys traditional had in the past was big theme.....so we got Sigourney Weaver (famously tall at 5'10"") served up as the female hero and remaining survivor who vanquishes the hard to get rid of pesky monster who invades several spaceships, and somehow is maneuvered out of the escape vehicle Weaver operates after she blows up the big space ship the monster invaded earlier. The crew was unsuccessful in evicting the monster, and everybody part of the crew dies except Sigorney (who plays ""Ripley"").<br/><br/>Good classic science fiction movies, of which ALIEN (1979) is not an example, provide good and fairly detailed science both verbally and visually, and are aesthetic in a way ALIEN (1979) was not.<br/><br/>The difference between George Pal's DESTINATION MOON (1950) and FORBIDDEN PLANET (1956) and ALIEN (!979) is a big difference, and ALIEN looks bad compared to these much better made sci-fi space travel classics.<br/><br/>The aesthetics provided in ALIEN (1979) are ugly...director Sir Ridley Scott served up the same thing in his famous (and equally ugly) BLADERUNNER (1981) movie two years later.....the outside of the big spaceship seen when the movie starts is inspired by the ugly 2001 SPACE ODESSEY (1968) hardware store plumbing parts welded together eccentrically design, neither likely, logical, or aesthetically appealing.<br/><br/>ALIEN (1979) pandered to political and social trends of the times (the 1970's) when feminism and defaming big business were trendy, and also the fact that video game explosions, flashing light, and bizarre monsters combined with a perpetually moving camera combined with extreme facial closeups flooded with body sweat and whites around all eyes shown were distracting....<br/><br/>People bought tickets to movies to obtain distraction (still do), and movies which serve up distraction sell tickets.<br/><br/>ALIEN (1979) was a success (still is) for that reason.

","This was a very different movie for its time. Most sci-fi movies were cheaply made in the 70s and had poor acting and things like that from what I can tell. Then Alien came along and sci-fi was changed from that point on. The acting here was first-rate and flawless. They used big-name actors to fill the parts in this movie such as Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Harry Dean Stanton and John Hurt. The only person who I thought was very annoying and poorly played was Veronica Cartwright's character, Lambert. I wanted her to be killed so she would shut up. Everyone else was perfect though. The story was excellent and well thought out. The costumes and FX were very good for 1979. I would recommend this movie for horror and sci-fi fans, you will enjoy it. 8/10."

The monster is ugly and dull, disgustingly drooling creature which kills humans. Some ugly gore, too. Atmosphere is non-existent.

Why are the crew members so stupid as to not realize staying together would be a lot safer? Each time one of them wonders off alone, which they do one by one, they become lunch for the dreaded space monster. You'd think anyone with sufficient training would understand the need for a 24hr quarantine under even life threatening circumstances. That stupid cat. Any time anyone goes near it it hisses and bolts away drawing whoever's following it towards the alien, was it working for the Alien? Why don't they have an escape pod or pods large enough to fit the entire crew? Is Lamberts only role to kick and scream and get in the way (very annoying clichÃ© character)? <br/><br/>They don't close the door after the alien detaches from Kane's face (not after there was enough time for the face sucker to possibly escape the enclosed area). And They don't chase the Alien that emerges from Kanes body until after it's long gone.<br/><br/>The acting was definitely solid but the characters actual actions not very believable at all.

","Director Sir Ridley Scott here creates one of the best science-fiction films ever made, with some horror, action and thriller moments thrown in. Basically, the commercial towing vehicle, Nostromo, is heading back to Earth, when they receive an SOS signal from a nearby planet, and they are under obligation to investigate. They have a bad landing, but three of the crew members, Dallas (Tom Skeritt), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) and Kane (BAFTA nominated John Hurt) leave the ship to investigate. There they discover a hive colony of unknown creatures, the computer message was not an SOS, it was a warning. One of the eggs is disturbed, and a parasite (face hugger) attacks and attaches itself to Kane's face. Dallas and Ash (Sir Ian Holm) do try to get it off, but its defense mechanism of acid for blood and the possibility of killing Kane (because it is feeding him oxygen) stops them. Soon though, he seems fine and this creature has detached and died. The pinnacle scene is where all the crew have dinner, and Kane starts coughing and struggling in pain, till his stomach suddenly gushes blood, and the alien (or Xenomorph) is born (looking pretty phallic). It grows very quickly, and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) is first to be attacked by the big, double-mouthed, acid dribbling alien. The crew plan to kill the creature and escape in the shuttle, and one by one die trying to find it. Ash also grossly reveals himself to be a android with the ""special order"" to bring this alien to Earth for scientific discovery. Eventually the other crew members, Lambert and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) are killed, till the commanding officer, Ripley (BAFTA nominated Sigoureny Weaver) (who grew a bigger character as everyone else died) is the lone survivor, along with cat Jones, and sets the Nostromo to self destruct and escapes in the shuttle. The alien was not destroyed though, but eventually she gets it out of the blast door, sucked into outer space, and blasted by the shuttle rockets. She concludes by making a report of the situation, with hope she will be picked up by the company, and she and Jones go into the pod for hibernation. I have also seen the 2003 Director's Cut version, but the only real major change is seeing Dallas cocooned, and a few chats, and many interesting scenes and moments cut out, I think the original version is much more interesting and essential. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Jerry Goldsmith, Best Costume Design and Best Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Sigourney Weaver was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, John Hurt was number 27 on The 100 Greatest British Actors, Ellen Ripley was number 8 (Hero) and The Alien number 14 (Villain) on 100 Years, 100 Heroes and Villains, the film was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 11 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, and it was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Films.

","The story of the movie is a typical old boring Jaws as everybody described it, except you're scared of pitch black labyrinths instead of the water. I would have enjoyed a movie about exploring an alien planet together with Sherlock Holmes/James Bond tier characters armed with interesting alien tech figuring out what happened. The space jockey had a hole in its chest, would had been nice to know where that alien headed off to. Would have been neat to meet a sentient alien that's actually interesting and had a striking design(Not Prometheus). John W. Campbell Jr. ' The Thing offered a much more mature, compelling scenario and an intelligent villain than Alien. Lily CAT did an amazing job with an alien bacteria that does 3 things in one.<br/><br/>Axiom Verge, Metroid, Lovecraft and many other sci-fi media did the claustrophobic atmosphere with moody music far better with far more creativity, content, structure/pacing. Ringworld/Halo did it better with a far better alien species and settings and weapons, Starship Troopers did the Vietnam war better again with more interesting and more powerful enemies, Deus Ex did the android better, System Shock did the stuck in a spaceship with a crazy AI better, Lily CAT did Alien far far better with the android and the monster and even characters. FF Spirits Within did the ""they're coming out of the walls"" better. Resident Evil has a better evil company and more diverse enemies, FEAR did it better, The Cave, Riddick, Starcraft, Half Life, Resident Evil, the list goes on.<br/><br/>Alien/s did nothing with the concept. The alien does not do anything with the hosts' attributes it steals because it steals nothing, unlike The Thing, they almost did something in Alien 4 but it was too little. The alien instead of having a new form every time they meet everybody just copies its final benis head form and that's it. The Visitor game did the ever-evolving alien better. Everybody stop saying Ridley created Alien.<br/><br/>I repeat: John W. Campbell Jr. ' The Thing offered a much more mature, compelling scenario and an intelligent villain. The Thing's problem was its immature gore design, oh boy a bunch of flesh, heads, tongues, arms - aka a chimera sooo appealing, not. Giger's design is striking/compelling because think of The Lich, skeletons, gothic stuff from fantasy. Giger basically takes a medieval fantasy skeleton and gives it a modern twist, a sci-fi twist. Skeletons, ghosts, vampires, dinosaurs are cool/sleek/eloquent, Frankenstein/zombies aren't. Skeleton dinosaur aliens, that's striking and defining. Skeleton terminator robots, also striking.<br/><br/>Scenery I enjoy The Derelict's design and the skull alien design, sadly it's barely featured in the movie. I hate the boring blue grand canyon desert scenery of LV-426, I hate Hadley's Hope and I hate the white plastic of the Nostromo, they look incredibly generic and dull compared to The Derelict. They could be replaced by any other hospital and tech-ship looking thing. I often mistake Hadley's Hope and Nostromo's interiors for various other sci-fi ships and bases. The Star Trek's interior looked far more welcoming than Nostromo's hospital-like, mental ward-like walls. Indeed I prefer Star Trek and Star Wars' sceneries, effects, planets, starships n ship interiors.<br/><br/>An actual competent special ops team would laugh their butts off and dishonorably discharge every single one of these uneducated slobs. A bunch of actual charming people would give these characters class any time of the day. An actual overpowered and cunning James Bond-esque villain team would put the Weyland Yutani and alien hive on its knees, same for a James Bond hero team. Even the Magic The School Bus children are more competent, charming, interesting than these pathetic losers who can't do 1 thing right.<br/><br/>By the way I laugh my butt off all the time whenever they try to make Ripley look appealing both as a trustworthy friendly person and as having sex appeal. In all the Alien movies she looks like Michael Jackson and her attitude is grouchy and dazed with a typically annoying voice like everyother redneck billy bob around there. Hollywood's finest, a bunch of reject actors with a reject director who got lucky and couldn't find proper work anywhere else.<br/><br/>In conclusion many other franchises and single IPs did what Aliens attempted to do, but successfully. Only difference? None of them copied Giger's exact sci-fi steampunk goth design. That's it. Everybody's picky about the fact it isn't ""Beksinski/Giger flavored""."

","In a world where previous sci-fi horror films were usually B-Movie films like the blob and Them, aswell as Hitchcock films like The Birds, Rear Window and of course Psycho, the horror genre never really tried to be overly complex or masterful like the way this film tried to be. Ridley Scott was able to create a Science Fiction world feel complex and believable as well as tangible. The Nostromo Ship has a very decayed and accomidated feel to it which makes it feel like you're with the characters in the setting as the tension and horror begins to rise and unfold.<br/><br/>The practical effects used for the Xenomorph and the Facehuggers were very complex and detailed for the time and the chestburster scene is a classic scene in horror that has been imitated in future film's from it's impact on the audience. Sigourney Weaver played such an incredible female protagonist as we feel her dread as the movie progresses. The final half an hour of the film is pure Sci-Fi Horror mastery with sustained tension and adrenalin throughout. The film is directed to feel cramped and claustrophobic with the focus on the alien's whereabouts as it's always shrouded in darkness until the very end, showing as little visual contact of the creature throughout the film until the finale where the monster is shown in all it's glory. The imagery of the Xenomorph itself is iconic in movie monster history being a very creative and intimidating design which had so much thought and planning into it's design and studying how it thinks which important just how to scare and satisfy the audience watching the revolutionary new take on horror. It's a directing style that was unique to the time adding more nuance and subtleness to the genre. The film is perfectly paced from start to finish yet never drags or feels boring in any of it's scenes. John Hurt also plays a great performance of the victim of the facehugger as thee whole imagery of it is incredibly creepy which was never done before at that time. It's overall a chilling, atmospheric and adrenalin pumping movie which has incredible rewatch value that actually gets better the more times you watch it"

","The movie is honestly great, but you know this already. It's a difficult topic for me since I usually hate sci-fi movies, but this one's definitely an exception. The cast is great: everyone has their way of being likeable. Sigourney Weaver in the lead role is spectacular and the special and practical effects are, too, in particular talking about a 1979 movie. The screenplay is great and proves you how the problem is not the Alien's cruelty, but are actually human stubbornness and ignorance. The way the horror is brought up is through a daunting feeling of anxiety and a very low number of jumpscares, which makes this way more enjoyable. The main twist about one of the crew members is also great. My only critiques are: the use of the cat, which should have not been there in the first place, as a huge plot advancement mechanic, the size of the spaceship which is just exaggerate for that number of people and for them to always be in the same areas and where the Alien is and the, in my opinion, underwhelming finale (honestly I would have ended it 5 minutes earlier)."

","In many ways, Alien was the first of a kind. True - it wasn't the first space movie to feature a homicidal monster, nor was it the first time a group of characters were hunted down one-by-one in dark, dank spaces. However, this ""haunted house in space"" film was one of the first to effectively cross-pollinate these two genres. Alien became the blueprint for dozens of rip-offs and three sequels. In addition to blending graphic horror with science fiction, Alien has another distinction - it is one of the first films to feature a female action hero. Even today, on those rare occasions when a woman takes the lead in an action/adventure movie, she is typically measured up to Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley. Alien contains its fair share of genuine scares. These aren't mere ""boo"" moments, where something benign jumps out of the shadows accompanied by a loud noise and a musical crescendo, but legitimate shocks. The first occurs when the face-hugger leaps out of the egg and attaches itself to Kane. The second is when the alien explodes through Kane's chest. A masterpiece."
"andrewnmiller","10","0","1","19 November 2018"," Space never looked so scary.
","My experience with Ridley Scott's 1979 classic, Alien is limited as I never watched it as a kid mostly because I was far too young to even see it and given how slow paced it is, I would have probably been bored by it if I did watch it, but as I got older and began to hear other people comment on how excellent the film was, I felt compelled to give Alien a watch and lo and behold, I absolutely loved it. From it's glorious visual style and effects to its marvelous soundtrack and performances, Alien is everything that most modern horror movies wished they could be.<br/><br/>The film opens with a massive mining spaceship called the Nostromo returning to Earth with its crew in status sleep. When the ship's computer known as ""Mother"" detects a distress call from a nearby planet, it awakens the crew and they are ordered to investigate. They land on the planet and Captain Dallas along with Lambert and Kane head out to find where the distress call is coming from. They soon discover that the call is coming from a gigantic alien spaceship and enter into its depths. Meanwhile, back on board the Nostromo, Ellen Ripley attempts to translate the distress signal only to discover that it may be in fact a warning but can't send the information to the other crew member. Inside the ship, the other crewmembers discover the remains of a massive alien lifeform. Kane then descends into a chamber full of egg-like pods and when he touches one, a spider-like creature leaps out of the egg and attaches itself to Kane's face. Dallas and Lambert bring the unconscious crewmember back to the shuttle and order Ripley to let them aboard but she refuses, stating that everyone else would be at risk but science officer Ash violates her order and lets them in. He and Dallas then attempt to remove the facehugger from Kane's body but with every attempt, it's grip tightens on his face but eventually, the facehugger lets go and dies. Upon returning to the Nostromo, Kane awakens from his ordeal but doesn't remember anything apart from a dream involving smothering. Before they return to status for the remainder of their journey, the crew have their last meal together. All of a sudden, Kane begins to choke and convulses in pain before a petit alien busts out of his chest and runs off into the ships cooling ducts. Now, the crew must find a way to capture the alien and jettison it out into space.<br/><br/>It's impossible to think that Alien was only Ridley Scott's second future film after 1977's The Duelists. The movie has the certainty of being made by a director who has decades of experience working within the genre and working with the most skillful filmmaking veterans, thus giving the film a rigorously gleaming grow to it, with an astonishing manner and craft. The movie has the look of an epic blockbuster but there's also no indication that the budget was ever compromised and there's very little to indicate that Fox tried to micromanage the production of Alien. It's difficult to imagine that Ridley's film ran into any of the same production problems Alien 3 was subject to because this movie holds everything in check so perfectly.<br/><br/>It's almost absurd to play down the importance of Alien both as a film and a gift to both sci-fi and horror. It popularized Ridley Scott and his visual style. It showed people that sci-fi movies could still be embedded in ideas and analogies rather than go the route Star Wars had gone two years prior as well as frightening the living crap out of movie audiences, something that it still does 39 years later and something a horror movie like The Nun hasn't been able to do. Much like Scott's other seminal sci-fi masterpiece, Blade Runner which is both innovative and sentimental which drew upon and renewed the understandings of film noir, Alien is on one point a meeting of two different genres of horror movies. On one foot, the movie is a haunted house film, centered around a foundation that dates back to the 1920s with a building that is haunted by an entity or a creature, which in turn bears ill will for those who enter while on the other foot, the movie draws from the slasher genre popularized by Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in which a group of people is killed off one by one by an evil force of nature who then does battle with the final survivor.<br/><br/>What Alien manages to do in one full swing is to deal with the central issue of both these film genres by a blend of ambiance and character development. The faults of many haunted house movies boil down to a basic idea: if being in the house is so horrifying, then why out leave? In Alien, there is simply no getting out. The Nostromo is a boundless maze of passages and cooling ducts with a creature that could be lurking anywhere, ready to pouch. The film is agonizingly suffocating, so much so that there is a point when the viewer finds themselves rapidly looking around each corner of the screen as the tension and fear begin to build. Additionally, the main issue of most slasher movies is that more times than not, the characters are so poorly written and paper-thin that the viewer has no investment in them. The principle reason people paid to see all the Halloween sequels was because of all the detailed and cheesy ways the characters were killed. Over its 40 year history, Halloween went from Michael Meyers being this unkillable incarnation of evil to being in a reality TV show and reduced to battling Busta Rhythms. Alien, however, takes its time to develop its characters in the movie's opening act. The first hour of the film is surreal and takes its time, from the unhurried Kubrickian camera shots of the Nostromo's hallways to the time jump of John Hurt waking from hypersleep to the mocking conversation about the food the crew is eating and the additional situation. Even after the facehugger attaches itself to Kane's face, the movie to its goals and keeps the character growth coming regardless of the situation. It adds to Brett and Paker's outcast position along with their loss of respect for Ripley, all of which become ever more important as the story continues to play out.<br/><br/>Alien has often been described as the anti-2001: A Space Odyssey, the lower-class description of space set against the glistering white grandeur of Kubrick's ideas. This isn't surprising in the slightest as screenwriter Dan O'Bannon who also wrote John Carpenter's sci-fi film, Dark Star brings over a lot of elements from that movie and adds it to Alien. Rather than be a polished clean spaceship, The Nostromo instead is a grubby and dilapidated ship inhabited by hard-working men and women who don't care for many things apart from getting paid and getting home. Aspects of corporate suspicion and gender discrimination are key to the films' overall look and feel such as when Ash disobeys Ripley's orders to confine the other crew members and acts incredibly arrogant towards her when she remains him who's in charge while Lambert is the complete opposite of Ripley as she comes across as the typical screaming women archetype seen in many horror movies but she is still never the less an interesting character. All of this makes Alien feel like an early example of having a strong women character who isn't an overpowered and over-feminized much like more recent Hollywood blockbusters. As a matter of fact, it's really because of her grasping her femaleness that Ripley is able to defeat the alien. She decides to go back and save the cat even though the ship is about to explode and then undresses in the escape shuttle and basically becomes a sensualized object for a brief moment. Of course, this is the scene in the entire Alien franchise where Ripley feels the most womanlike but only after grasping a sense of femininity that she seems to have hidden for the majority of the movie. The company depicted in Alien with Ash as their ambassador, are snooty, selfish and indifferent to the lives of everyday people or even women. Those same people are the ones who end up saving the universe even if they have to risk their own lives in order to do it. Let's also take into consideration the character of Ash as because he is a robot, he is a flawless clone of a human, thus sowing the seeds for what Blade Runner would later do. Although he may not do certain things normal people do, Ash can still interact with the other members of the crew of the ship which in turn makes him all the more unaccepted than Ripley even is. There are no feelings of erotic slanting in his actions as the movie progresses much like the rest of the crew to a point that Ash seems almost loveless. However, once he starts glitching do his actions take on a more sensual approach. His body gestures during his conflict with Ripley no longer feels ordinary which given how Ash doesn't even act like a normal person but rather looks like he has blown a fuse. His bizarre actions start with his entrance into the Nostromo's navigation room. His mannerisms towards Ripley look disturbingly like a sexual violation, right down to his effort to suffocate her with a magazine so if this scene isn't some kind of Freudian declaration then I have no idea what is. All of a sudden, the character of Ash who has spent the majority of the film extroverted and informal becomes a passionate hunter in the same vein as the alien itself.<br/><br/>The final test for all horror movies is whether or not the movie is even scary, and while Halloween still remains the most terrifying horror movie I've ever watched, Alien is still pretty damn close in terms of suspense and dread. A high part of this lies in the practical creation of the movie. Much like John Carpenter, Ridley Scott understands that authentic horror exists in the viewer's mind and that people aren't frightened by what they see but rather by what they think they see. By displaying so little of the alien until the very end of the film, Scott implants a seed of dread and terror into the viewer's mind, which continues to grow as the deaths be"
"Casual-Critic","10","0","1","19 November 2018"," Rare cinema perfection
","Ridley Scotts 1979 classic is a milestone in modern SCI-FI and Horror. Supporting a strong non sexualised female lead; a bold choice for a '79 film. (reminiscent of ideology from 'The Monsterous Feminine') and masterful filmmaking Alien doesn't disappoint in any category and is sublime down to the smallest detail. Alien should be an essential viewing for any lover of film and Art."

"charlieoso","8","0","1","21 October 2018"," ""The pit is completely enclosed. And it's full of leathery objects, like eggs or something.""
","Back in 1979 Ridley Scott brought us his second theatrical film in Alien and he does quite a job in only his second film. It feels weird rating the film lower than the average, but stating that it is highly recommended by me to anyone who loves horror or sci-fi. To me a 8/10 is still a great movie. And groundbreaking as well!<br/><br/>A spaceship Nostromo is on a return flight to Earth. The 7 person crew lead by Tom Skerritt is awakened from their sleep early due to a transmission that they need to investigate. It is within this investigation that crew members come across a not so nice alien.<br/><br/>Really has a terrific cast also including Sigourney Weaver in her powerful role as Ripley, Yaphet Kotto as Parker and John Hurt as Kane to name just a few. Jerry Goldsmith did the score and he really did create a wonderful, yet at times subtle or weird music score. H.R. Giger did spectacular work creating the look of the alien and the alien ship. Carlo Rambaldi was then brought in to create the head of the alien and one of its secret weapons. The film also does a great job with its use of sounds or concentration on a specific sound in its way to bring terror to the screen. A great scene where the use of sound is quite effective is the one where Harry Dean Stanton who plays Brett is looking for the cat Jonesy. Not exactly sure why there is a cat on a spacecraft, but it didn't seem to bother me too much.<br/><br/>Now as well this film along with another Ridley Scott-great BLADE RUNNER has been ripped off so many times, but never equaled. Usually the rip-offs are stinkers. Last night I watched this film with my girlfriend. I have seen the film perhaps 20 times, but she had never seen it. She really enjoyed it, but perhaps through some of the ripoffs she has seen it was predictable for her. I must say though on my initial viewing (think I was 12 at the time) all the surprises were genuine for me. I would also place this film in the list of best Ridley Scott films. I must say though that I see some inspiration within the script written by the late Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett and direction from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Which is fine by me, because I believe that is greatest sci-fi film ever made. For example the use of having a computer running the ship and really in control of everything was not original. Here it is known as Mother in 2001 the computer was known as HAL. Even the crew not being aware of the full story or every detail on their assignment was not original either. That same thing happened in 2001. I feel I need to make these points, because I do believe O'Bannon and Shusett did create a great terror in space, but some of the plot points may have been borrowed from a groundbreaking sci-fi epic made 10 years prior. But, other things that happen in the film that are original have to do with the alien itself.<br/><br/>Before ending this review though I must say Veronica Cartwright who plays Lambert in this film did a great job, because she truly looks terrified many times during this film. Also starring Ian Holm as Ash.<br/><br/>So, if you are a horror fan or sci-fi fan I would strongly suggest checking this one out. You might love it more than I do. Then you can start on the countless sequels that follow and continue to be made to this day."

Alien is such a well made film that you'd be hard pressed to find any fault in any department. Acting, cinematography, production design, pacing- the film is top of the tops, all kudos to the young Englishman who deftly nurtured everything under his control.

I can only imagine how mind blowing it was to walk into the cinema in 1979 and see this film for the first time.<br/><br/>There's probably nothing I can say about this film that hasn't already been said. Suffice it to say that the atmosphere, world building and acting are all sublime and make for a great film.<br/><br/>The never ending question: Is Alien better or is Aliens better?

","Over the decades, this movie has definitely set itself apart from other sci-fi and horror/thriller flicks. The design of the xenomorph is entirely unique for the genre; it combines the fear of a parasite that can consume one from the inside, and later a sophisticated predator that hunts its prey relentlessly. The sense of fear, confinement and paranoia adds to the suspense that is built up gradually. The viewer is given time to get comfortable with the setting and learn the personalities of the crew members before things are thrown into chaos, which allows you to be invested in their survival.

","My favorite film of all time Ridley Scott's Alien is a masterpiece of two genres- horror and science fiction. Shot in a studio in England Alien reeks of atmosphere and is a textbook example of talented people collaborating to create something truly special. H.R Giger who designed the alien planet and more importantly the Alien(called the xenomorph) has created works that have become etched in our collective conscious. Ron Cobb's design of the Nostromo is unique and special in that it looks greasy and dirty- totally unlike the sleek futuristic space vehicles science fiction expects to feed us with. Dan O Bannon's script is crisp and lean. The actors are all fantastic- Roger Ebert mentions in his review of the film how they were all older in age than the usual age range of horror movie characters and this adds depth and credence to the proceedings. They were all special and all went onto have great careers. Of course above all is Ridley Scott's direction.

","With films coming at an AK 47 rate, seldom will an audience encounter anything like Alien ( all sequels are still as terrifying ) with all the gut-ripping, face-locking, seemingly more intelligent than humans creatures in a spaceship destined for doom. However , it is also interesting to note that Sigourney Weaver immortalized the character, Dr Ellen Ripley. When something is new, be it anything , a toy, a car, books , films - our curious nature is always triggered , with Alien our imagination and fear of what's out there has been called to the surface. A lot of cast members here went on to establish film careers as a result. If you're not a scaredy cat, this film must be in your library."

","As with so many movies that center on isolation and the like (particularly in the 1970's), this one tops the rest. When it comes to space movies, you're bound to feel a bit isolated and claustrophobic. Then add in the element of not feeling alone. Put those all together and you have this dynamic work of art. Before he made movies like ""Black Rain"" and"" ""Gladiator,"" Ridley Scott sat in the director's chair and made this. Believe it or not, I was introduced to this movie through word of mouth from the least expecting person from the church that I used to attend. My brother and I looked at each other and couldn't believe that we heard this unsuspecting guy actually talking about a movie like this.<br/><br/>At any rate, the two of us sat down and could understand where this man was coming from. We practically had to bolt ourselves down to the furniture that we were sitting on because it was chock-full of suspense. If there was ever a movie to come out of the 1970's with legitimate scares and the like, it would certainly be ""Alien."" We sat down and watched the initial three that followed this and could only come up with one thing: the first one was arguably the best. <br/><br/>With suspense and paranoia literally at every turn, you do not want to watch this either in the dark or alone. You cannot go wrong with isolation and claustrophobia in a sci-fi movie such as this one. In the end, let me say this: watch this movie once and then watch it again. If you truly enjoy watching a sci-fi movie that has more suspense then gore (and there are only a couple scenes in here where there is blood and gore), sit down and watch this. I will guarantee that you will love it."

The movie uses a slow build-up approach, and gradually increases the tension, terror and suspense.

The plot is incredible and has a major twist that you find out as you keep watching. The plot makes a big opportunity for prequels to be made (Prometheus and Alien Covenant). This is the best film of its series (Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 And Alien Resurrection). I find that this movie is the strongest of its series because it focuses more on its mystery horror, I think it's better with the one Alien because it feels mysterious and almost invisible. The characters are vowel developed and you can easily get attached to. <br/><br/>!¡!SPOILER!¡!<br/><br/>I found the implement that the company set it all up that the Alien was supposed to be put on the ship to take back as a weapon and that one of the crew is in fact an android.<br/><br/>I would recommend it for about 12/13+ (with parental guidance) and 15+ (without)"

There is one exception, I won't betray the surprise there, but in all other instances I was shocked at the lack of professionalism among the crew. It's sort of the opposite of intercession by the gods as a plot device.<br/><br/>I seem to be the only reviewer bothered by this, but for me it's a deal-breaker, even in an otherwise excellent film like this.

","Once the film started, I felt like I had seen this before. There are so many space travel horror movies that follow the exact same pattern than Alien. Now I don't know if Alien is the first one of its kind, but it's definitely the best known. I actually saw Prometheus before any of the Alien films, and it's almost annoying how closely Prometheus followed the same pattern as this one. The writers of that movie should've come up with something slightly different, because if you've seen Alien, that makes Prometheus predictable - and the other way around. <br/><br/>But it shouldn't be surprising every science fiction horror filmmaker wants to make a film like Alien. Alien's pace is just right - it's slow, but it doesn't feel too stretched. It's making everything even more intense than it'd be with faster pace. But with faster pace it would probably be harder and more annoying trying to keep a track of this movie. <br/><br/>One really effective thing about this film is how gross everything looks. There's always some gross liquid coming out of somewhere. Otherwise the effects seem sometimes ridiculous, like the little baby alien running away. How can you take an intense, dramatic scene like that seriously when the effects are what they are?<br/><br/>I don't enjoy this movie as much as other people can. I appreciate the horror elements and the value this film has, but I hate space travel science fiction. Simple setting is better, and of course the setting of Alien is simple - it's one ship, barely one planet and so on. Still I felt like I didn't completely understand what was going on.<br/><br/>I appreciate this movie, and I recognise it's good, but I don't really like it, which affects the medium score I'm giving this film."

The third act of the film is so tense, so excellently shot and so well performed by Weaver. It is a well put together film with a great cast and a great creature, beautifully realised by H.R. Giger.

However Scott does his part in introducing classy alien horror and other features. I prefer such kind of cinema instead of slashers though the film has its share of gore too.

At the beginning the film is quite slow, and this is nothing but a smart directorial choice to raise the suspense yet emphasized by the dark atmosphere and the terrible silence of the outer space. The plot twisted and turned within the Nostromo space shuttle (except when the astronauts land in the unknown aliens' planet) but the film is not boring at all: instead is thrilling, the cast is exceptional and harmonious, the direction is outstanding and the plot is interesting and very new at that time. The charming character of the brave Ellen Ripley stays sculpted in the history of science fiction's cinematography.

","Space isn't all lasers and light swords but rather a dangerous unforgiving place. Throw in the mystery of space, a spectacle of Sci-fi technology, and deadly chest-bursting creatures; and you have the Ridley Scott film.<br/><br/>The film is a unique sub-genre of a (soft) science fiction- a thriller. Just like any thriller the story allows you to get used to the characters and get you on their side before hell breaks loose. Now Ripley, played by the talented Sigourney Weaver, being impressive and funny as the Nostromo's executive officer who manages to act tough, efficient and sexy all at the same time. This extremely likable character is the main driving force behind your sub- conscious feeling of wanting to see this person survive.<br/><br/>The world that we are introduced to in Alien is in a time far into the future where space exploration is a norm. There's cryo-sleep capsules, advanced suits that allow you to survive in the vacuum of space.<br/><br/>The movie is short which is perfect for this science fiction-thriller, a thriller going on for more than two and a half hours gets old quickly. The amount of momentum the movie has from start to finish is quite impressive in Ridley Scott's dark take on space exploration. You get a sense of progress and increase of momentum as you see the evolutions of the 'alien', and the build up of fear from the crew from being trapped on a ship with this deadly being. As the story progresses the crew is picked off one by one just as thrillers go, but good 'ol Sigourney Weaver (Ripley) keeps the rest of the crew going just off of pure grit and tenacity. Add in killer androids, the deadly vacuum of space, and near impossible scientific situations-you get the formula for a great Sci-fi thriller film.<br/><br/>This movie was the one of the starts to thriller Sci-Fi's, there were already films made that had these themes-but this film definitely popularized this specific genre. It gave us intense situation and different outcomes of what can happen in the dark vacuum of space, giving us fear of the great beyond, and many movies after followed in the same concepts: Interstellar (2014), and Gravity (2013)."

"Rickting","8","0","3","25 December 2014"," In space no one can hear your scream- or yawn. But mostly scream.
","Review of the Director's Cut<br/><br/>In Ridley Scott's beloved science fiction horror, an alien gets aboard a spacecraft and goes on the rampage. It's a very simple and stripped down plot without a lot of stupidity, and it's pretty much Jaws in space. Alien is first and foremost a scare fest, but beneath the simplicity you can tell Alien is saying some deeper things. In my opinion, this is about the fear of different species and paranoia, and this is made more powerful by the fact that the film is set in space, as it explores these themes in the claustrophobic corridors of a beautifully designed spaceship. Alien is a good, solid effort for all involved. I don't love it as much as many do, but it's definitely a good movie. The slow pace can test the patience a little, as often parts such as the discovery of the egg and the face hugger segment seem longer for no reason, but the slow pace also signifies maturity. The brilliant visuals disguise a somewhat weak and overly simplistic script, which lacks real personality although at the same time it makes the films characters feel more like real people.<br/><br/>I wasn't a huge fan of the script, but it's got many fine qualities. I'll never understand why John Hurt was nominated for an Oscar when he barely has anything to do in this, but it's a well acted film. Ian Holm is wonderful as the android Ash, while Sigourney Weaver (Believe the hype) is superb as Ellen Ripley, and is one of the best female movie characters of all time. Ridley Scott has lost his way a bit recently, but his flawless direction which fills every frame to the brim with nerve shredding tension really would be spoiled by any modifications. The production design is mind blowing and the scares and very skillful, although the famous chest burster scene is blunted in impact by being such a poorly kept secret. Alien has its boring scenes, but don't let that put you off at all. I'm not the biggest horror fan out there, so I don't relate to it as much as some do. A tense intergalactic haunted house thrill ride with the best tagline in movie history.<br/><br/>7/10"

Just when they think that the voyage is over, they receive a signal from an unknown planet, and they decide to investigate. When an enigmatic foreign organism attaches itself to one of the exploring crewmembers, the crew lets the alien of unknown origin onto the spacecraft, and they soon realize that they made a mistake. <br/><br/>As the original film in one of the most successful franchises in the sci-fi/horror movie sub- genre, Alien was a defining moment in film. Filmed on an unprecedentedly small $8.4 million budget, this movie showed that with a devoted director and some resourcefulness, almost any film can be accomplished. This was Ridley Scott's big break as a director, and he would go on to give us great films like Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, and American Gangster. Though it was capitalized by its visual effects, this film also had some great characters; including Ellen Ripley, who is one of the most iconic female bada** characters in film history. Also, the movies version of aliens, a popular sci-fi staple, is also very recognizable. Now let's talk about the horror aspect of the movie.

The Nostromo looks like a real space vessel, and the mysterious wreckage is bizarre and haunting. H.R. Giger's vision of ""biomechanical"" adds a style rarely replicated in film. Only he could create such a terrifying creature. Seriously, the xenomorphs are among the scariest monsters ever filmed. They're not your typical greens or grays.<br/><br/>...I just wish the characters were stronger. I didn't connect with any member of the cast. Not even Ripley. I couldn't get beyond their occupation, or role in the story. This is a big problem when the movie's pace is slow. Since I already knew a lot of the plot points, the suspense sometimes felt boring. It doesn't need a lot of development, but some more personality would have gone a long way. Also, ultimately, the plot is a typical slasher/creature feature. Its one of the best, sure. Its still predictable.<br/><br/>While I don't think its the best movie of any genre, I enjoyed it, and defiantly respect its ambition. If you haven't watched it yet, its pretty good.

","Alien is a classic in both the horror and sci-fi genres. It's got some really great stuff in there and is easy to enjoy. But I will say that I don't quite think it's the absolute masterpiece that a lot of people think it is. If you want to really be harsh to the film, it's essentially a typical horror slasher kind of film but in space. I don't think it should be considered that simple, but I do think that's something I noticed and kind of brought it down a little bit for me. But I do think its a super fun film that is certainly a classic.<br/><br/>The plot, while not exactly super original by today's standard, is interesting. It's about a cargo ship in space that is returning to earth and ends up investigating some sort of signal that they pick up on the way, which leads to them picking up a little bit of extra cargo...cargo that kills. It was most likely more original in 1979 than it is now, but regardless I still think it works. The first half of the movie is establishing characters and location and the whole scary situation, and the second half is the intense and frightening stuff. I think for the most part the movie holds up. Yeah, there are a few practical effects that you can totally tell how they did it and see its fake, but somehow even those scenes still work. There are also some really great and intense scenes, such as the ventilation system scene, and when Brett goes to find that cat. These scenes are filled with a sense of dread and really can be scary.<br/><br/>I must say that Sigourney Weaver gives a great performance. She feels like a strong female lead without any of that cheesy ""hey look we made a female character really cool"" kind of thing going on. It feels natural and is great. She's a likable character and you feel for her in this terrible situation.<br/><br/>Overall, I do understand why this is a classic, it's fun and quite well made, and really gets a lot right. I don't exactly think it's a 10/10 like a lot of people seem to think, but I really do think it's entertaining and influential."

","Alien, directed by Ridley Scott, is considered by many a classic sci-fi/thriller masterpiece that horror fans young and old must see. This is why I was very disappointed by this film. I'm not saying this is a bad movie. I thought it was okay. But that's what was disappointing to me, it was just okay. <br/><br/>I think we can all agree on how good the special effects and set designs are. Even today, the visuals are still better than a lot of the CGI used today. And most of the cinematography did a great job setting the tone for a lot of scenes. However, I believe that the director might love the visuals way more than he should. There's a lot of establishing shots that go around the interior of the ship. I know this is to build up suspense, but it really slows the pacing. Though, the pacing picks up when the alien is introduced, most of the film is still so slow, if 15 minutes was cut out, I wouldn't have a problem with it.<br/><br/>I was hoping with the slower pace, there would be a lot of character development. But, the only character I really got to know was Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). There's a bit of fun dialogue between the rest of the cast, but we all know that they are just there to be killed off. The biggest surprise was with Ash (Ian Holm), but I'm definitely not spoiling that twist.<br/><br/>Despite the slow pace, when the alien does finally show up, the thrills, scares and suspense makes most of the dull pace worth it. It was done so well, it genuinely made me jump from my seat. With scenes like these, I see what make this film so loved.<br/><br/>Overall, it wasn't the horror classic I was expecting, but I'm still glad I saw this. Perhaps I would have a different reaction if I saw this the day it came to theaters... or perhaps not. The pacing is too slow, most of the characters are forgettable, and the film has aged a bit. But what truly makes this movie is not only the visuals and the tone, but when it brings out the thrills and the kills."

","Title: Alien<br/><br/>Condensed Storyline: A space vessel receives a signal coming from a planet, they investigate only to find that an alien parasite has bonded to one of their crew. <br/><br/>Notable Acting: The group of characters is a mix of stereotypes, boring characters and good characters. The boring ones are those who will die very early on and the stereotypes such as the guy who does everything by the book and the guy who wants to do as little work as possible will survive along with the good characters until the end. <br/><br/>Noticeable Camera work: Establishing shots of the spaceship for the first couple of minutes before we are shown the human actors. Followed by a 180ยบ turn around to table with them all eating and foreshadowing. But apart from that there aren't too many other noticeable shots, they are good at showing scale of object compared to people, but you would expect more variation from a movie that is trying to build suspense. But it was made in the late 70's so I can't complain too much <br/><br/>Costume: Just like the Predator costume, the Xenomorph is a timeless classic. Created by using practical effects only, it is one of the most recognizable fictional aliens there is. <br/><br/>Incorrect Science: The ship informs them that they have received an acoustic beacon. Acoustics is the science of sound. Sound requires a form of matter to pass through, such as solid, liquid or gas. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum, which space is. Apart from this, there is very little to comment on as the alien's method of reproducing isn't alien in any respect, as there are insects on our own planet which plant their eggs inside another living being until they are ready to hatch. But the size growth of the alien would indicate that they have short lifespans or high metabolisms as they grow insanely quickly. <br/><br/>Overall Feel: One ending of this movie had Ripley escaping into the ejection pod, only to find that the alien is already in there and she dies in the end of the movie. That is an ending I would have preferred as it would have prevented the travesty of it's sequels (3&4) which ruined the franchise. The who idea of the Alien is based around insects, it reproduces by planting eggs in a host and having them grow inside the host. They have a hive mind set and they are all male bar the queen who calls the shots. Sadly none of this can be seen in this movie, only in 'Aliens'. The movie takes a while to get interesting, and this is around the 25 minute mark and is because you need time to set up and establish everything, but you won't miss much if you just skip to 25 minutes, only the reason for them being on the planet. Some parts of the movie have stood up great for a 70's movie, and some parts are cheesy and don't work, but it is still a great movie all together and a sci-fi and horror classic."
"lpklump","10","0","1","23 July 2014"," Alien marked the beginning of great sci-fi.
","1979 would mark the staple beginning for serious alien sci-fi movies. Its shocking realism, that was developed by special effects master Stan Winston, combined with director Ridley Scott, created something that will last forever. <br/><br/>This movie took the basic plot of two earlier movies, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and It! The Terror From Beyond Space. However Alien succeeded in making you believe that it was real. Jerry Goldsmith could compose for space like no other. Hearing the score from the first note made you feel like you were in deep space. This particular combination of talent took the world by storm. <br/><br/>For me, this was the start of great sci-fi."
"rcolgan","9","0","1","19 July 2014"," ""In space no one can hear you scream.""
","Just as Jaws is the icon of horror for the seas, Alien is the image of fear for space. It's the film that all other sci fi horrors will look up to and try to imitate. But none have been capable of matching its brilliance remaining the defining picture of horror in space. And it's easy to see why with visuals that hold up as well today as they ever have and one of the most threatening monsters put to screen.<br/><br/>When it was released we got an image of space exploration unlike any that we'd seen before. Scott ensured that there was a realistic and believable example of space exploration. He carried this out with groundbreaking special effects being used to create the vast landscape of space and the claustrophobic design of the spaceship. All this detail was vital in creating the terrifying setting needed to isolate the crew and secure their doom. <br/><br/>The vast emptiness of space reminds us that there is nobody there to help them and they are alone against that monster. The ships narrow corridors and enclosed environments reminds us that they have nowhere to run. On top of this we truly care for the crew. They are all believable characters with distinct and memorable personalities that make us want to see them through it alive. But we constantly doubt there survival each time the Xenomorph strike by appearing as a indestructible monster. <br/><br/>Whilst the design of the Xenomorph is one of the most impressive of cinema, what made it truly iconic is how little we see of him. Even in the iconic trailer of the film we never once see him. Because the film is not about the attack, but instead focuses on the fear leading up to it. The creature lurks in the shadows. We see only glimpses. The sharp threatening teeth. A blank emotionless face. That smooth skin. Any sight we do get of him simply makes him into a more imposing and threatening figure, without any single feature of humanity visible. <br/><br/>We see him just the same way the crew can see him thanks to these quick glimpses. And just like the scared crew we know that it can strike at any given moment. There is nowhere they can run to in space, so they are never safe. In every lingering shot we never know if or when he'll strike. It's this anticipation of the attack that makes this film so incredible. Doom appears as a certainty to the crew members with nowhere to run to. When it does strike it's brief and one sided with the crew standing no chance against the monster."

","This was the first adult type sci-fi or horror movie I had ever seen and it was the perfect blend to keep my interest and not make it scary in an un-watchable way. It was a battle from start to finish and now I have enjoyed other similar movies in this series and other great sci-fi I might have avoided. This helps you appreciate good realistic sci-fi as opposed to ridiculous cheap sci-fi. A must see for young fans that have graduated from Star Wars and are ready for the grit of reality and suspense of humanity as seen in this film. The other Alien movies are almost as good and the prequel Promethius was great as well. This made that movie more exciting for me and should for you as well. Don't forget that there is a great Aliens vs Predator film as well to bridge the gap in time from Promethius to Alien and beyond."
"vincentlynch-moonoi","6","0","1","11 June 2014"," A little tired the second time around
","To me, there's a big difference between watching this the first time and watching it a second time.<br/><br/>The first time for me was 1979 on a double date with a reading teacher and a married couple (we were all teachers). The girls offered a night out for us, on them. So they picked an expensive restaurant...and paid. And we got to pick the film -- ""Alien"". I guess, looking back, we were kinda cruel to pick this movie, because it had no appeal all to the women. I remember literally jumping out of my seat at one point (although not the scene where the alien bursts out of the man's abdomen). I would have give the film an ""8"" then, and I haven't re-watched it for all these years Now I would only give it a ""6""...because once you know the plot, a lot of the suspense is gone. There's a lot of dead time in this film as they walk around the space ship looking for the Alien...building suspense (if you haven't seen the film before). And, some of it is so predictable. Was anyone really surprised when Harry Dean Stanton bit the dust? No, we knew it was coming...even before we really knew the plot, he had to die.<br/><br/>And really, the acting here is none to impressive. About all I can say is that the actors did their jobs. I might give a real nod to Sigourney Weaver for work above and beyond. But for the rest, they did well.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, if you haven't seen this, you'll love it (if you're into this kind of film). It's not so good as a rerun...although even I relish the scene of the alien bursting out of John Hurt's belly -- that is iconic film making."

","Thrilling, mysterious and gripping throughout, Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi masterpiece Alien is undoubtedly deserving of its cult status, as the film's stunning visual effects set the standard for the genre, inspiring many to follow its footsteps. Remarkably well-directed and designed, the film's outstanding feature is its ability to successfully maintain the tone of suspense and fear, as the audience follows the space crew in their struggles, trying to combat the alien that invades their ship. Although Alien offers few dynamic action scenes, it is the constant fear of the unknown and the lurking presence of the deadly creature that ultimately defines the film. Many have tried, but few have succeeded in recapturing the riveting style of Alien, both in terms of the film's groundbreaking cinematic techniques and its exhilarating storytelling approach."

This is one of the best Sci-Fi movies out there, it's a classic.<br/><br/>First of all the pacing of the movie is so well done, and it's necessary to be that way so it improves the horror effect on the viewers. You can actually see the movie and start thinking ""there is something wrong happening"". Then the shadowy ambient surrounding the spaceship and also the point-of-view scenes that make us ""run"" with the characters is wonderful.<br/><br/>The cast is very good, with a good center performance by Sigourney Weaver mainly. And the very design of the alien is horrifying, with a humanoid form but without showing any expressions meaning it is a cruel killer.

","First, let's explain the origin of the movie. Dan O'Bannon Wrote a draft of a script titled ""Memory"" around 1973-74. In 1975 he went to Paris for six months to work on an adaptation of Dune by Alejandro Jodorowsky. When he came back to the USA without any money after the failure of the ""Dune"" project, O'Bannon's life was deeply affected by this failure and the only thing he thought at this moment was to write a script. So he continued the ""Memory"" script and recalled it ""Star Beast"". This title was fast abandoned and replace by ""Alien"". The script was accepted by the 20th Century Fox, they chose Ridley Scott to direct the movie and some people of the ""Dune"" team, like H.R. Giger and Jean ""Moebius"" Giraud joined Scott on the project. Giger and Giraud made all of the beautiful designs of the movie, especially the monster ! The following is part of the history...

","Everybody loves Alien.... except me. I don't know what it is. I like cheesy monster movies like Godzilla, but the rubber suits just couldn't get by me here. I'm not really jumping with joy that it's on the top 250. I like 'Aliens', the second movie in the series. There shouldn't be any puppets or rubber suits in these popular phenomenal movies. Blurgh!<br/><br/>One of the highlights I guess is Sigourney Weaver's good acting. This was one of her first well-known movies. The part of Ellen Ripley was originally written for a male, but Sigourney Weaver showed up and said women could do the part as good as any man could. Imagine if we had an Elliot Ripley!<br/><br/>One of the features that really bothered me was the alien itself. That phenomenal scene where it bursts out of that guy's stomach with lots of bloody guts and gore, I think they did it better in 'Spaceballs' (1987)! The alien was merely a hand puppet which would look better if it were part of the Muppet Show, and when the alien goes to full form, it just looks like a cockroach walking on its hind legs!<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is alright, but not something you'd go out of your way to see. It's definitely a ****** performance. How people like it so much, I don't know. I definitely don't like this that much, but I don't mind the sequel, 'Aliens' (1986) over this one!"

"AnthonyWatkins","9","0","1","28 November 2013"," The perfect definition of a new genre
","Perhaps the most memorable Sci-Fi horror film of all time, Ridley Scott's 1979 film ALIEN helped to define this new genre in several different ways.<br/><br/>This film is all about giving the viewer suspense, and it accomplishes just that by starting out slow and building up anticipation for the second and third acts. Suspense is delivered through several ""jump"" scenes. However, it's also delivered by using the ""less is more"" technique. (Used in Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" in 1975) Throughout the film, the actual Alien does not get a lot of screen time, but this is a good technique to use because seeing a creature too much in this kind of movie can have a negative impact in that it leaves almost nothing to the viewer's imagination. <br/><br/>Another important element that makes this a great film is the realistic special effects, especially for 1979. A lot of work went into the making of the creatures and the results are astounding. I won't give anything away, but one scene in particular uses real (pig's) blood. Since this scene was filmed in one take and the actors didn't know exactly how the scene would be done, the reactions by the actors are completely genuine and the result is extremely positive. <br/><br/>In the area of the story for this film, the plot is fantastic. Astronauts in the spaceship ""Nostromo"" set out to investigate a distress call they pick up on the planet LV-426. They later discover this signal was a warning rather than an SOS call. After they leave the planet, they discover that extraterrestrial creature has sneaked on board. The setting for this film is perfect because, being on a spaceship, the crew is ""trapped"" in a way with the creature on board hunting them down. There's also strong character development in each of the main characters, particularly Ellen Ripley. It should also be noted that Sigourney Weaver gives a terrific performance in this film, as she does in the subsequent films in the ""Alien"" saga. <br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Alien"" is easily one of the best films ever released, and probably the best ever sci- fi horror film, though it may be tied with the sequel ""Aliens."" If you enjoy sic-fi horror, it would be a crime to miss seeing this classic film."
"rhiron","8","0","1","6 November 2013"," A pleasant surprise
","I went into 'Alien' expecting a terrible, low-budget space-age horror film in the form of 'Jason X'. How wrong I was!<br/><br/>A friend introduced me to the 'Alien' series after I loaned him 'The Omen' franchise and, while I watched it mainly as a gesture, I discovered that this is truly an awesome film. And the fact is that, even for others out there like me who probably aren't too keen on sci-fi films, this does not really strike you as one. Indeed, chances are that through things like 'Family Guy', 'South Park' and 'The Simpsons', you've probably seen reworked scenes from 'Alien' already!!!<br/><br/>For one thing, the cast is excellent. Sigourney Weaver broke into mainstream films here, John Hurt got the most memorable scene, even Yaphet Kotto who played Bond villain, Dr. Kananga in 'Live And Let Die' (1973), and Ian Holm in a particularly memorable turn early on in his film career. And, for horror aficionados, Veronica Cartwright, who made her debut in Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds' (1963) and appeared in the disturbing remake of 'Invasion of The Body Snatchers' (1978), gets a key role here. As does a cool little cat named Jones. Oh, and don't forget 'Mother'.<br/><br/>The model work, set design, costumes and even all the space-style gobbledegook that would usually put you to sleep - it's all great. And did I mention that the legendary composer Jerry Goldsmith provided the musical score? To savour this film, all you really need to be is a fan of horror and/or action films, or just an adventurous audience member.<br/><br/>So this really was a pleasant surprise for someone who's proud to admit that he was wrong. I even have the 'Alien Quadrilogy' DVD set because of this film and its sequel 'Aliens' (1986). I can really recommend this set of DVDs (or Blu-Ray, if you prefer), because it includes both the theatrical version and the Director's Cut, the latter of which includes so much stuff that wouldn't have appeared in the cinema and adds to the plot.<br/><br/>If in doubt, read some of the other reviews. Hopefully there are other people like me who have been turned by Ridley Scott's genius! Sit back and enjoy a different kind of classic!!"

","Alien. The first alien horror from able hands of Ridley Scott back in 1979. Long duration scenes, chilling silence, neat characterization, haunting back ground score, few surprising twists and state of the art special effects. All these convert a conventional looking survival story into a magnetic thriller. It is termed as sci-fi but I would say there is less science and more fiction here. Sigourney Weaver who have acted in all alien movies is the leading lady here and does the fantastic job in making the character worth rooting for.

While searching the ship, one of the crew members is attacked by a parasite life-form that attach's to the hosts face. He is later brought back by his shipmates and recovers, successfully removing the parasite from his body.... or so they thought. The movie has great suspense and with none of the cheesyhorror music to ruin the best parts. It shows no mercy and puts some ofthe most ordinary characters in the most difficult situation against the worst foe. Ridley Scott's first masterpiece, and one of my favorites, this movie is the birth of true space horror. 4*/4"

","When I tell younger people about movies that were revolutionary, like 'Jaws, Star Wars & Alien,' it is hard for them to comprehend just how incredible these motion pictures were. Back then, pretty much everyone watched the same pictures that were produced, because we didn't have anything close to the voluminous productions that seem to churn out weekly in 2013. When I watch most older films, I have to use my imagination more (like watching a play in a theater), but this seems to be harder for our children to do, because they are hand-fed stimulating, very realistic looking, HD graphics now. <br/><br/>Alien scared the crap out of us in new ways, without the use of computer enhancements. It used camera angles, lighting, and modeling to a novel degree. The writing was also fresh, with an ominous monster like never before created.<br/><br/>So, I am listing this as one of the ""Revolutionary Films"" of my lifetime."

","This movie is really excellent and haven't too aged despite its age. The rise of anxiety is progressive, but totally mastered. The scenario is not very profound but it's okay. Letting some unanswered questions helps to deepen the fear of an unknown enemy. Each appearance of the Alien is both terrifying and beautiful. The music accentuates the fear. Sigourney Weaver, aka Ripley, is perfect in his role. Some moment are quite gory, but there are not many. The atmosphere claustrophobic in the middle of the space is well rendered​​. The sets of the ship are in total agreement with the atmosphere of the movie. The suspense never released, until the final unexpected. A great movie !<br/><br/>(sorry for the expression, I'm french)"

","This is my favorite movie of all time. From the start, where Ridley and her crew wake up to the end where she blows up the ship it's pure brilliancy. This movie proves you don't need special effects to have a good horror/ SCI FY film. The chest-burster scene is just an unforgettable moment too. Who would think of an alien latching onto someone's face, then plant a seed in them? Then to make that alien die off and have the larva burst out of a man's chest. It's one of the best scenes in horror history. And it has a great build up, as the alien picks the humans off things get really tense. So if you're reading this review stop and go watch this movie. NOW! I promise you won't be disappointed."

","Alien is a movie that is hard to review in 2013. I watched a few days ago and it still holds up. It is hard to review because of how loved it is. I loved the movie but there are some things I need to address. The beginning is a bit slow. There are just shots where nothing is really happening. I really liked 2001:A Space Odyssey so I should be able to tolerate that but I just didn't work as well. Once they find the derelict the movie really starts to pick up. I don't know if that counts as a spoiler though. To be honest the movie didn't scare me. The tension the movie creates is fantastic but it didn't scare me. As a suspense movie it is amazing. There is only one scene where I was like OMG but the rest was just tense and that isn't a bad thing. The mystery of the Alien is incredible and it keeps you interested. The ending wasn't groundbreaking but it does the job. I give it a 9 out of 10 because of the slow beginning but I will still buy it."

","I still remember the terror I felt watching this in the theater so many years ago! Ridley Scott's Alien is a truly horrifying horror/sci-fi film that really brought that genre back to life of 50's alien movies. The music, cinematography and sets are astounding. Most of the performances are mediocre with the obvious exception of Sigourney Weaver, although Ian Holm is interesting. There are several extremely scary sequences in this film, one of the more brilliantly staged ones being Tom Skeritt's hunt for the alien in one of the air shafts. It is truly terrifying. This film does have its flaws however. The small bit of nudity at the end is totally ridiculous and really makes the power of the film drop at the end. And some of the dialouge isn't that good. But overall a great movie. And the music is incredibly scary...especially during the opening credits. It sets you up for the terror that is soon to follow!"

","Tactically there were several things the crew cold have done. The ship was able to detach from the freighter portion of the Nostromo. Once they realized the alien was in the freighter portion, they could have escaped in the ship. They went looking for the alien. The smarter thing would have been to huddle together and let the alien find them. They could have donned space suits, tied themselves down, and opened an airlock when the alien showed up. Technology existed to make an android as sophisticated as Ash yet there was no such thing as internal sensors or scanners aboard the ship? The idea of an alien cocooning a victim was to create more aliens. This alien was wasting its time. It cocooned Brett and Dallas (see the directors cut) but no other eggs existed with face suckers. They would have starved to death. Finally, I would have hid in the computer room where they accessed the mother computer with flame thrower in hand. There was only one way in or out and if the alien appeared, you could have fried it."

","As it being an old movie, 'Alien' was meant to be a horror movie, but it wasn't scary. 'Alien' was very suspenseful, and very well done for what it is, so it was really good. I watched it as a sci-fi thriller movie. This was a very good sci-fi thriller movie. It was suspenseful, interesting, and had cool images. That's what a sci-fi thriller is supposed to have in it. There was even some action, and things I've seen once before. That's because I saw 'Prometheus' before this. I liked this as well as I liked 'Prometheus'. The technology difference probably makes this a better movie. The scenery for this was great, and this movie was a very good idea. 'Alien' was very, very enjoyable almost all the way through. I thought the beginning was kind of boring, but still a bit interesting, because it was such a good idea.<br/><br/>The movie did have very little time on the planet, but in the time that the scenery was beautiful and worked well for this very strange planet. The alien ship was also worked on very hard for a long time and the look of it worked well for an alien ship, but mostly because we would have no knowledge of what an alien ship would really look like, so the architects of it could be creative. They did really well in this one, because it didn't have the architecture of what we'd THINK the ship would look like. There were very strange things that didn't really fit in to an architecture of a ship that made sense because again, it's an alien ship. I really thought that worked well for it. That was very cool.<br/><br/>The movie's scenery and architecture was really cool, but I saw this movie to see a bunch of people on a ship getting killed by a huge alien, and it delivers that well. There was a really suspenseful, intense, awesome, good and long part that gives us what we came for. The part was long enough to give us what we wanted, but not too long that it got boring and stopped being interesting. This was mostly because of what all was happening. It was able to be suspenseful enough that it kept it's solidness and was still able to be just as intense. It was kind of like when a horror movie is scary enough that it can repeat several times and you're focused on being scared, so it doesn't get old. It was like that, but only with being suspenseful instead of being scary. Anyway, that part was incredible and kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was, of course, the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>For most of the movie, it was very interesting, because again, the story line was great. This part of the movie was enjoyable and very strange. The story was able to stay good because of the events that happened leading up to the big part of the movie I talked about in the previous paragraph. Several strange things that almost didn't belong there (like in the architecture of the ship) were there, but they worked. This part was a little boring, but it took a while to get boring, because so much happened here. Right behind the part in the previous paragraph was a little interesting, but boring. It was able to stay enjoyable for that long. One or two major story events happened then, which were actually intense (so they were enjoyable). Those were the best parts of the lead-up to the big part of the movie.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie had some good, intense action that was very enjoyable. In this part there weren't odd things that you wouldn't think about being there, but it was very enjoyable; but sadly, the lack of those things made the end get a little boring. I still liked it, though.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone who's thinking about seeing it. It's a little boring in some parts, but it has beautiful scenery, amazing architecture, intense, suspenseful sci-fi thriller sequences, and some fun action. The movie was a little bit longer than I think it should have been though. Anyway, the 8/10 rating means the movie is really good."

","If you want cinematic kicks, Ridley Scott's massively successful Alien will give you them in profusion. Physically, I mean. No film I have seen in the last year or so, excluding perhaps The Deer Hunter, emanates so strong a whiff of palpable, nerve-straining shock. It is, in fact, an audience reaction picture par excellence. Which explains, perhaps better than the colossal build-up, why everyone wants to see it. The public now seems to be sitting back in its seats and saying ""Amaze me."" Alien, above all others recently, can be relied upon to do just that.<br/><br/>Alien<br/><br/>Production year: 1979<br/><br/>Countries: UK, USA<br/><br/>Cert (UK): 18<br/><br/>Runtime: 127 mins<br/><br/>Directors: Ridley Scott<br/><br/>Cast: Ian Holm, John Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt<br/><br/>More on this film<br/><br/>Yet it does so, oddly enough, with a story that is basically just a mixture of The Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Thing from Outer Space. A dozen other 50s-sounding titles spring to mind – well, 60s at any rate. The point is the added 70s proficiency. You won't see anything very original anywhere in the film, other than in the actual making of it. There, no holds are barred. Scott, a recruit from advertising, where instant atmospherics has to be the order of the day, manipulates his audience in a far stronger fashion than he managed with The Duellists. His combination of space fiction and horror story is no great shakes as a work of art. Artifice, however, it has in profusion.<br/><br/>The basics of the plot are simple. Seven astronauts, working on a battered space tug that is apparently commercially owned, touch down on another planet, find something odd for the boffins back home, bring it back into the ship and are faced with an ever-growing monster. It comes back aboard slapped across the face of poor John Hurt and ends up grinding its way through his stomach. From there on in, everyone is faced with imminent catastrophe.<br/><br/>Scott, aided by his special effects team, headed by Brian Johnson and Nick Allder, and many others who deserve to be mentioned but can't be, creates in the confined space of his main set a sweaty little world on its own that responds ideally to his obsessive close-ups and restless, magnifying style. Hurt has said that it was more a matter of reacting than acting, and one can well understand what he means. His own performance makes one miss it when it's gone. And that of Sigourney Weaver, as one of the two women astronauts, is also consistently watchable (with a bigger slice of the cake).<br/><br/>The others – Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright and Yaphet Kotto – do what they can faced by the swirling, well-drilled logistics of the piece. There's not enough writing for proper characterisation, not enough plot development for the mind as well as the senses to bite on. But for sheer theatricality, if one can apply that word to the cinema without insulting it, Alien is difficult to beat – even without that substance which might just have put it up there with the great movies of the genre.<br/><br/>Some people call it a cruel, heartless and essentially exploitative opus. Something to gibber at, in fact. But Alien is not in the business of old-style family entertainment (which was, after all, often as warm and gooey as hot treacle, and about as nourishing). It bases its appeal on a different set of values. Not very enlightening ones, no doubt. But exactly in tune with much more cynical times. It deserves its success for gauging, and gorging, its audience so thoroughly. Technically a British film, it certainly shows how much talent we have in this country if only we had the courage to develop it ourselves. But that's another story, and a much less exciting one."
"sonumania123","9","0","1","2 July 2013"," Over thirty-years-old, yet it remains to still be the one of the greatest sci-fi movies off all-time.
","Ridley Scott's Alien is without a shadow of doubt one of the greatest sci-fi movies made. Starting from the dreary opening credits you know for a damn fact that this isn't going to be a charming journey.<br/><br/>The films start of with bringing in the crew of the Nostromo, who are returning to Earth. Along the way they receive a signal of an unknown object. They were ordered to check it out and which they did. It's best to stop here, don't want to give too much detail. I want the audiences like myself to be surprised when they see this the first time. <br/><br/>The script is amazing and it must be talked about it here. The majority of creature movies nowadays, the characters that are being implied mean utterly nothing to the conclusion of the story, and by the end, you (the viewer) don't mind about the final character left standing since he or she has not impacted themselves emotionally to the viewer. It's okay if they die. Alien in the other hand, the characters are extremely important. They seem like real people, and you will understand what they're going through. The script provides itself to an appealing, and frequently counts of entertaining dialog among the crewmembers, and for that reason it's huge news if one of them dies.<br/><br/>The acting as well goes damn good with script. Everyone is at the peak of his or her appearance in this film. Sigourney Weaver symbolizes the power, the brains and slight sexuality of the character Ripley. She is this standing out character. Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Ian Holm and Veronica Cartwright all struck the success level bars with their roles as Dallas, Kane, Ash, and Lambert.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're a fan of sci-fi, suspense thrillers, I vastly recommend Alien to you. It's crafted to be nerve-racking suspenseful, and it's one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time. I also do like Alien more than Aliens, but nonetheless Aliens is also a superb sequel."

","I wanted SO badly to give ALIEN a perfect 10-star rating. Science Fiction and Horror are difficult genres in which to work, whether you are a novelist or a filmmaker, and it is a genuinely rare gem of a film that actually straddles both genres, succeeding as both sci-fi and horror in a single one-two punch.<br/><br/>ALIEN does all this; in fact it is one of the most terrifying outer-space movies ever made. So why did I lop off two stars? Because of the soundtrack. I never saw the movie in a theatre, so I don't know if it had this problem in a large space, but on television you can't hear half the dialogue. Now this is not a problem unique to this single film, but I've never seen a film so hobbled by it. I don't know how much of the blame to lay at the feet of the Dolby crew who recorded the sound, but director Ridley Scott did not help matters; he lets his actors whisper so softly in so many scenes that after thirty-five years there are still some lines that I can't make out. And if they aren't whispering, they're mumbling (Tom Skerritt in particular is the worst offender in this regard), which if you replay the scene often enough you might finally figure out what he says but there's no guarantee. At any rate it makes watching this film a little like doing homework. A pity, because if only they could fix the sound issue, this would be a great film.<br/><br/>Deep space. The industrial starship Nostromo (its exact function is a tad bit murky; I've seen it described as everything from a towing vessel to an interstellar garbage barge) picks up a signal from a nearby planet. Thinking it an SOS, they go to investigate and discover a desolate planet that appears to have been abandoned, so they go on their way. But that signal was not an SOS; it was a warning to stay away, and we soon discover that the Nostromo has picked up a very unwelcome stowaway.<br/><br/>The alien in this film is a cinematic icon: it has been copied at least in part countless times, possibly the most obviously in INDEPENDENCE DAY. And the film is one of the last in the genre before CGI special effects changed the industry. CGI has made things almost too easy; so easy, in fact, that directors misuse it and the results scream ""FAKE!!!"" louder than anything from the old Fifties B-pictures. The title ALIEN may well be the most accurate title in the history of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver heads a brilliant cast that works hard and the film is wonderfully effective despite the soundtrack issues. I keep hoping that one day they can remaster the thing so that watching this film won't take so much work."

I'll simply mention the excellent work of Sigourney Weaver who's career was launched with this title, and Ian Holm who's performance is truly unforgettable.<br/><br/>The bad. The only reason I didn't give this movie a perfect score was because some of the technology is getting old. The size of the main computer. The many blinking lights. And the text interface, to some extent. Only two special effect sequences are really getting old. The planet-side landing of the ship. The triple explosion with the sheet of fire.<br/><br/>The rest can easily be imagined as some sub-standard rough industrial technology, a bit like what was done in Serenity (review yet to come), the crew having to deal with less than ideal conditions or hardware.<br/><br/>The ugly.

","33 long years later, Alien is still a definitive sci-fi film. It provides some genuinely intense scares, and the execution still remains strong. After 33 years, this movie still feels executed like a modern film, which is a true testament to the genius of Mr. Scott. The slow brood of atmospheric storytelling and action is paced so well; my heart was genuinely pounding as the characters walked the many corridors of the Nostromo. <br/><br/>The special effects are fairly incredible for such an old film, save for a few outdated effects. Ash's reveal totally took me surprise and the discovery of a certain ship is pretty incredible, and the alien was incredibly realized for such early years of advanced sci-fi film making. The acting is so strong and so intense, which is something I love about old films. Sigourney Weaver felt like a secondary character at the beginning, but her character evolves so well by the end, and by the finale I realized the power of her performance. Not only is it strong, but 33 years ago these actors had to use an incredible amount of imagination and creativity in their performances. <br/><br/>Back in the late 70s sci-fi horror genre, a barley explored genre with less than mediocre results, aliens were a scarcely explored film topic (save for Episode IV), so with this ""new frontier"" in the Hollywood made all the performances so strong and so intense, and so sincere. The acting, the pacing, the storytelling, the suspense, and roller coaster second half all proves Alien a triumphant classic.

"JohnWelles","9","0","1","21 March 2013"," Acid Trip
","Alien (1979) is a science fiction classic that is strangely unoriginal. The ""used future"" idea that is so central to the movie's success was used before in scriptwriter's Dan O'Bannon's own Dark Star (1974) and in George Lucas' Star Wars and not only that, but the plot is a crossbreeding of The Thing (1951) - the dark prowling search for the monster through underlit corridors - and It! the Terror from Beyond Space - the actual plot of the alien running amok through the spaceship. Having read Dan O'Bannon's original screenplay (with a co-story credit for Ronald Shusett), it's easy to see why studios were reluctant to pick it up: one dimensional characters, a very simple, linear story progression, an alien that looks like a chicken. It is promising script that could turn into a good film. Yet is this hindsight, knowing what would come from it? When Walter Hill's company Brandywine bought it, they immeasurably improved the characters, removed a lot of unnecessary to-ing and fro-ing, crucially added the android Ash to add another layer of complexity to an otherwise too simple story and, at the suggestion of (possibly) Twentieth Century Fox head Alan Ladd Jr., turned Ripley into a woman. O'Bannon provided the bones, Hill along with David Giler, added the meat. However, no script credit for them, due to a series of falling-outs with O'Bannon and the W.G.A. ruling (wrongly in my view) in favour of sole credit for O'Bannon. However, we still have a remarkably derivative script; no magic here.<br/><br/>It would take two people to turn a script that was an unapologetic throwback to fifties' monster movies into a classic, for that is what the final film is: Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger. There must have been some nervous studio executives the day Scott agreed to do the film; his only other movies had been 1977's The Duellists: a good period film, uses Harvey Keitel and David Carradine well, but trades too heavily on the tricks of Barry Lyndon. In fact it gives you a pretty good idea of the vices of Scott: too impressed by technique, whereas Stanley Kubrick knew its limits as well as its virtues. Still, Brandywine had been impressed enough when they saw it at Cannes to hire him; they felt his handling of sets was exactly what was needed. He was. Ridley Scott's direction helps turn the film into something mysterious, beautiful, scary: even today, his skill is eye-wateringly impressive. The killing of Brett is an audio and visual sequence that should be taught at film schools: the slowly, delicious building of tension, while (crucially) no music plays: just the sound of dripping water and swaying chains, a sound that would later be utilised for the early promotional trailers. His constantly moving camera up and down the fantastically realised sets of the spaceship Nostromo turns the ship, along with the camera, into another protagonist. Scott had evidently studied Hitchcock well.<br/><br/>Giger's involvement though was a make-or-break decision. His art is so sexually disturbing and pushed too far, the film could've become dominated by it. Cleverly, Scott separated his legends of science fiction art design: Ron Cobb, Chris Foss, Moebius, to tackle only the human built aspects: the spaceship and its cargo. Thus, when the Nostromo intrudes into the alien landscape, there is clear difference in the look that could have become blurred if all the designers had worked on everything. Giger tackled only the alien and its environs like the Derelict and the Space Jockey. The Alien, a truly sexual predator, is his piece d'resistance, boldly and brazenly horrifying like no other creature of the night before or since, at least forty percent of the film's success is due to it. The acid blood of the creature underlines too how much of a fantasy it is as it leads to the question, why doesn't its blood burn through its own skin? It's a clue that the film, despite on the surface being a science fiction picture, is in fact really, deep down, a horror film.<br/><br/>Another reason the film works as well as it does is because of its canny casting: Sigourney Weaver, strong but vulnerable, a great female role that helps define the film. John Hurt, a last minute replacement for Jon Finch, an unsuspecting victim of oral male rape and the anchor to the still wince-inducing chestburster scene. Together with Ian Holm, Tom Skerrit, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright and the great Yaphette Koto, a crew is created and characterised so you know and care about them before the killing starts.<br/><br/>Alien is a Freudian bisexual horror in that both male and female characters are raped and are equally dealt with by the alien; is this seventies feminism, with a female lead who is treated in a non-sexist way by her compatriots, taken a step further? Or is a cautionary parable about the future and an early warning against corporatism that would become so much part of the cinematic landscape in the eighties? So many different readings, but Scott concentrates on the most interesting: our darkest fears and their unique link with sex in an almost Cronenbergian way. The alien is all the more scary because it isn't infected by Hollywood thinking: it's not out to take over the galaxy, to destroy mankind. It's just a predator, not even unique, sharing similarities with Earth-bound parasites on a larger scale and finally, at the end, it is the end old struggle: a woman against a monster (is it the alien then the ultimate rapist?). Alien finally then fits into the horror mould of the seventies and eighties in a tradition that continues to this day: the lone, heroic woman trying to survive against a knife-obsessed killer. Alien then has its roots in the Giallo, transplanted to America via Halloween (amongst others) and brought into space. In space, no one can hear you scream."

","I've seen and collected thousands of movies over the years, and ALIEN has withstood an ongoing test of time (35 years now, as of this re-write of my review) as staying my all-time favourite. I'm one of those guys who'll watch good movies over and over again, until I remember and can recite it word for word from the beginning dialogue: ""I am cold.""...""Still with us Brett?""...""I feel dead""...""Anybody ever tell you you LOOK dead?""... I kid you not. Since it's VHS release, I've owned every available North American released home video version, up to and including the new 35th Anniversary Blu-ray set.<br/><br/>At least a dozen times per repeated viewing, I find myself reminiscing how I felt and how I was affected by different scenes when I first experienced them. I was a 15-year-old lad when I first saw this, on its opening weekend in Winnipeg Canada, at the newly renovated Capitol Theatre. I went by myself, and to be honest I only saw two thirds of the film - my eyes were closed behind my hands for the other third. I was 15! I walked out of that building just vibrating, knowing I had experienced a new threshold of fear, and other patrons were visibly shaken as well. I didn't know movies could BE that scary... and I've been a horror fan ever since, and have seen a LOT of VERY scary movies - but nothing ever came close to experiencing the kind of frights I got that Saturday afternoon in the Capitol Theatre in 1979.<br/><br/>So it's nice that the FOX marketing department agreed, in calling this ""the scariest movie ever made"", in their ad campaign prior to the Director's Cut re-release. Because that statement is true. ALIEN has been often imitated, but never matched in its raw ability to frighten one into fits - period. If you've never seen it, make plans to. It's bar-raising, game-changing, cinematic history. If you entirely disagree and many of you may, unfortunately it's a ""you had to be there"" scenario - you've only enjoyed the experience of seeing what you think are better and scarier movies because ALIEN set the standard for them in the first place. THAT'S why this will always remain my fave - we love movies after all because of their emotional effect on us, and for myself this will always be the most blatant example.<br/><br/>This isn't just a movie, it's an event.

","It doesn't matter how old this film gets its a timeless classic. Ridley Scott has managed to do what most others try again and again and fail. He has set a benchmark by what others use as a template for formula for a true horror suspense. It sees a crew being hunted down one by one through a maze which is the mother ship heading back to earth. With a cast perfectly balanced and an alien on the rampage it's edge of the seat stuff all the way to the end. With rare glimpses of the beast it goes to show that you can leave so much to the imagination and that's what scares us the most. With iconic scenes and a script that moulds the cast giving little known actors golden performances. Throw in a face hunger chest buster android make shift flame throwers and a certain Jonesy it has all the ingredients that makes a classic. Try if you may but really in space no one hears you scream!!!"

","The spaceship has a simple mission: transport ore. The crew isn't heroic and doesn't have a military training. These are simple workers who stumble on a profound revelation: an ancient world constructed by unknowable beings long gone and a horrifying monster waiting in the ruins.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott gives plenty of space to the unsettling designs of H.R. Giger and infamously kept his actors in the dark when filming the bloody chestburster scene, capturing the genuine emotions of surprise and total horror.<br/><br/>For a film from the 70's Alien knows how to make horror even more horrifying. The scariest scenes are drawn out and incredibly tense. The visuals are dark, detailed and ambiguous, always forcing the viewer to second-guess. Even in a film featuring the most terrifying creature ever designed the most horror is generated by the unseen and the implications: that outer space is vast and unknown and lethal."

","This is my personal favorite sci-fi movie. Starring Sigourney Weaver. After receiving a signal from a remote planet, the crew of a mining ship is going to investigate. They find a crashed ship there with inside many egg-like things in there. One of the eggs hatches and wraps itself on one of the crew members face. One back on the ship the alien unwraps itself from the member, lying dead on the floor. The crew member wakes up like nothing had happened. Then all hell breaks 'out'. Because the alien put an embryo inside the crew member that burst out of the crew members chest. From that point on the suspense begins. This movie is outstanding, and the alien design is wonderful. The cast delivers everything right, especially Sigourney. You really get the feeling of isolation in space, you can't go anywhere. Great sci-fi movie with a big deal of suspense and horror. Set design is amazing and the score of Jerry Goldsmith is hauntingly beautiful."

"yasenkiranov","10","0","1","29 December 2012"," A very effective and well made horror film
","Nowadays horror films just throw CG blood and gore in your face or they try to gross you out in some other way.I thought that ""Alien"" was likely to be the starter of this trend(Aliens that burst out of people's chest- plenty of opportunity for gore).However,I was surprised to discover,that ""Alien"" is a very well made and brilliantly executed movie.<br/><br/>Although the film was made with a fairly low budget,it does everything in it's power to look like a professional piece of work and in that regard it succeeds greatly.The cinematography is amazing,the camera is always focused in such a way,that when the alien appears,it catches the viewer off guard,even if he was expecting to see the alien in that scene.The perfect example for this is a scene near the end,when Ripley is already aboard the shuttle and thinks the alien is gone.The creature is actually sleeping between some pipes,but they made his head resemble the pipes so well,that I was really shocked when the alien awoke.<br/><br/>Unlike many horror films these days,the characters aren't just cannon fodder.We also have a very likable protagonist-Ellen Ripley.Each character has a distinct personality and I liked how they would often come to conflict,like in the scene,where they are arguing whether or not they should bring Kane back to the ship.<br/><br/>The pacing is a little slow in the first 20 minutes,but I think this is necessary for the sake of introducing us to the characters and creating some build-up.There is a pretty good plot-twist near the end,but I wont spoil it.<br/><br/>The film doesn't just rely on cheap scares.There are a lot of very suspenseful moments and some very disturbing scenes.The scene where the alien kills Lambert,for example.<br/><br/>Alien is a great horror film.It's well made and suspenseful.I strongly recommend it."
"illbebackreviews","5","0","1","18 December 2012"," No denying its a great film, I enjoyed it, but unfortunately cannot love it
","Let me start off by saying that I certainly enjoyed 'Alien' but cannot love it like many films such as LOTR, Original Star Wars, Back to the Future and so on, however I certainly enjoyed it for what it was. It was a great story, full of great characters and superb directing and acting. I'll also straighten this out. The reason that I didn't love the film wasn't because of the fact that it didn't have enough action/horror moments but because of the tone throughout the movie.<br/><br/>What I mean by that is, most of the film feels a bit too quiet for my liking. It took me forever to get into the film, because of the excruciatingly slow start. It wasn't because there wasn't any kill or anything like that but the story didn't start off very interesting. I would've liked the start more if they simply started with a couple of people saying a couple of jokes or something similar. It took me over 45 minutes to get into this film, however from that point on I did not stop until the film was over. After that point, I loved the film a lot.<br/><br/>I really came to enjoy the characters during the film and strangely found myself mainly fascinated by Ash. I'm not sure if this was because he was played by Ian Holm, and he was in Lord of the Rings, but I loved his character. The character twist for him absolutely shocked me and I loved it. I also loved Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver and also liked Parker a lot. One character I actually didn't like was Lambert and she was quite a let down for me. I found her annoying for some reason. Apart from her, I loved every other character.<br/><br/>The Special effects for this film are amazing for its time. It was made in 1979 and much like the original Star Wars, the special effects exceed its time period! The film didn't actually capture the creepiness that I expected it to capture, but the story was great, the characters were great and the execution was brilliant. The pacing was the only major issue with the film. Apart from that, this is a highly recommended film for everyone."

","Before Ash was synonymous with chainsaw wielding and demon fighting, it was probably known more for spewing milk and being a straight up prick of a robot.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" reminds me more of a slasher than a sci-fi movie. It's got a body count. It has jump scares. It has characters doing predictably stupid things and dying because of it. It also ratchets up the gore meter in a scene that will leave you shocked if you haven't seen it yet. Maybe due to Dan O' Bannon helping write this, as he'd later go on to make ""Return of the Living Dead."" The movie opens with credits that remind me of the old ""pong"" video game. We find the Nostramo floating randomly through space. The lights all turn on, and the crew wakes up from a deep sleep. Interestingly, Kane is the first to wake up, as he is also the first to die. It's almost like he's meant to spend these last few moments we see him helplessly alone.<br/><br/>A big issue in this movie that really never pays off is the subject of bonuses. The crew is supposed to be coming back to Earth with mineral ore, but for some odd reason, the ship has woken everyone up far from Earth. In the contract, if there's a signal of unknown origin, they have to go check it out. So the ship, controlled by ""Mother"" does just that. Mother reminds me of ""Hal 9000"" from ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Except it doesn't talk, it just acts like an asshole and withholds all useful information.<br/><br/>So they head towards the mystery signal, and their landing equipment reminds me greatly of the radar they used in ""Star Wars"" to navigate through the Death Star. Seems this movie is borrowing heavily from everything. They land on the planet, and of course the ship gets dinged up because we can't ever have a crew that correctly lands anything.<br/><br/>Dallas takes Lambert and Kane out to investigate where the signal is coming from and find a ship, that after watching ""Prometheus"" I finally understand. In fact, inside the ship they find a giant fossilized skeleton with a hole exploded through its chest. Huh.<br/><br/>Deeper inside, Kane finds some eggs which react to a gas layer being broken above them. So he jumps right in and gets an alien stuck to his face.<br/><br/>Now, there's a basic quarantine rule for people who have things like this happen to them, but Ash, a science officer, ignores it and lets all three back on the ship, so he can run tests on both Kane and the species. It appears the creature is feeding him oxygen through a tube inserted into his throat, but when they try to cut the creature off, it drips acid that burns through two floors of the ship. Eventually it just falls off.<br/><br/>So everyone thinks things will be okay, and decide to have one last dinner before going back to sleep. Unfortunately, Kane suffers the most painful horror death I've ever seen. This allows the new baby alien to run around, leaving the crew to chase it and get killed off one by one.<br/><br/>There are a ton of misdirections in this movie. Jones the cat keeps popping out right as the suspense is at its peak. And we also find out that Ash is a robot, programmed by the company to get the alien back home, at the cost of anything and anyone. Also, in the end, we have a final surviving woman in her underwear, literally, fighting off the creature to the death.<br/><br/>So yes, I'd say this movie qualifies as horror, possibly even high production value slasher. Sure it tells a story that makes a lot more sense and is a lot more interesting than, say, ""April Fools Day"", but it is what it is. And it's a lot of fun while being just that.<br/><br/>_______________________ For all the Horror Banana's reviews, visit http://morozov924.hubpages.com/"
"Hey_Sweden","10","0","1","12 November 2012"," One of the quintessential sci-fi horror films.
","Taking inspiration from such B pictures as ""It! The Terror From Beyond Space"" and Mario Bavas' ""Planet of the Vampires"", the extremely iconic ""Alien"" still stands tall, 38 years after its release, as a prime example of how to do everything right in this kind of film. It's got powerfully effective atmosphere, dazzling landscapes, innovative visuals, memorable special effects, and a slowly, steadily building sense of dread.<br/><br/>Nowadays, in genre fare the convention is to knock people out of their socks with spectacle and constant action (not to mention quick cutting); here, the filmmakers, led by the visionary director Ridley Scott (in only his second feature film) dare to take their time and parcel out the horror carefully. In fact, the big ""money shot"" of this film doesn't even occur until almost the halfway point. And what a potent scene it is, in its time having the ability to shock viewers out of their complacency.<br/><br/>The story tells of the crew of an interstellar towing vehicle who intercept an extraterrestrial S.O.S. and are obliged to check it out. What they find are a derelict spacecraft, an unpleasant truth about that message, and an insidious alien menace that proceeds to make mincemeat out of the terrified individuals involved.<br/><br/>""Alien"" was a revelation in the way that it introduced a new breed of space traveller to the science-fiction genre, one that didn't dress in uniform but who represented the average working Joe or Jane. It also created one of the most striking creatures to be found in cinema, one that grew in stages, and did unpleasant things to the human body. The design is by the great Swiss artist H.R. Giger, the execution by Carlo Rambaldi, and its hideous sexual overtones are not lost on viewers. Jerry Goldsmiths' music is beautifully eerie and nicely understated at times. Even the opening credits have a fantastic, spooky simplicity to them.<br/><br/>The limited number of human characters insures a high degree of intimacy, and the actors, a superb mix of American and British talent - Tom Skerritt as the ineffective Captain Dallas, John Hurt as the fatally inquisitive Kane, Sigourney Weaver (in the breakout performance that made her a star) as the take-charge Ripley, Harry Dean Stanton as the laid-back Brett, Yaphet Kotto as the argumentative Parker, Ian Holm as the subtly dubious Ash, and Veronica Cartwright as nervous wreck Lambert - completely draw us in to the reality of their situation.<br/><br/>As things progress, one will notice that the pace picks up considerably in the second half, as things quickly go from bad to worse to unthinkable. Plus, the script (screenplay by Dan O'Bannon, based on a story by him and Ronald Shusett) definitely has something to say about the nefarious nature of corporate interests.<br/><br/>All these years later, the film is still quite capable of chilling audiences, and set forth a beloved franchise including three sequels, two crossover projects with the ""Predator"" series, a prequel (""Prometheus""), and the upcoming ""Alien: Covenant"". Must viewing for genre fans.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","Alien is one the best movies involving acting, suspense and twists all at the same time. This movie had amazing affects for its time and they are still pretty good today. Alien builds up suspense throughout it and keeps you in the edge of your seat. Sigourney Weaver is the main character in this movie she plays the character Ripley and does an amazing job. This movie is very scary and if you like twists would be great for you. <br/><br/>Alien one was of the best movies of its time. Throughout the entire movie they had excellent effects that most people back then could be convinced it was real. Even when they had a hard shot to do like when the main character Ripley was fighting an alien in space they kept it looking real just like space. But most people even now are amazing how they made the aliens look so good, they look extremely realistic and there body movement was unbelievable. The effects in the movie Aliens are truly amazing.<br/><br/>Suspense is a big factor in epic movies and Alien has that factor. In the movie Alien there is suspense throughout the entire movie from the time when they were bridge a planet they had lost contact or at the end when Ripley is fighting the mother alien. In parts of the movie Ripley needs to hide from the aliens it builds a huge amount of suspense because the aliens are usually just about to find her and sometimes they do so she needs the either fight or run. Without suspense this movie would define tidally not be as good.<br/><br/>I understand why some people might not like the movie Alien. The biggest reason why people might it like this movie is because they can't take in all the awesomeness or they may have noticed some flaws. This movie might be to unrealistic for some people and they just aren't convinced by all the affects and good acting. Another reason people might not like it is how the aliens repopulate so quickly, on out day there may be about 100 aliens but the next there might be 1000. But these things still make the movie amazing and I love it anyway.<br/><br/>The movie Aliens has some very big twists. Near the end of the movie they think that they have killed the mother alien but it actually comes back and Ripley has to get rid of it once and for all. Also at one point in the movie Ripley is hiding from an alien and she apt hunks it gone but it actually isn't and it jumps around the corner and they has to shoot it to death. Twist ending are always fun it watch and they definitely make they movie better.<br/><br/>Alien was an amazing movie when it came out and still today. From the affects to the acting it all makes the movie amazing and anyone that watches it won't regret it. You should make sure to watch out for the mother alien, it is very scary and it will eat you alive. I think that if you are wanting to see a movie involving aliens and action then this is definitely for you."
"edwardwb","10","0","1","26 October 2012"," The absolute benchmark in Sci-fi horror!
","Fourteen viewings over thirty three years, and still my favourite film. Such is the power of this intense, foreboding masterpiece - perhaps a clichéd word, but in this instance, entirely apt.<br/><br/>Did Ridley Scott realise what effect this film would have on audiences for years to come? I doubt it. Did creature designer HR Giger know to what extent his 'alien' would horrify the world and be copied far into the future? Perhaps.<br/><br/>From the moment John Hurt's character 'Kane' re-boards the ship, insect-like alien attached to his face, unrelenting dread and imminent danger pervade this film until virtually the last frame.<br/><br/>Acting is masterful, especially from newcomer at the time Sigourney Weaver. All take their roles seriously in this very atmospheric film. No foolish character sidekicks here, no silly jokes.<br/><br/>Jerry Goldsmith's score is incredibly well-suited to every scene, perfectly building tension to excruciating levels, and maintaining it.<br/><br/>Audiences were not only stunned at the film's original artwork and design, but by the continuous and mounting terror as the barely-glimpsed alien picks off crew members one by one.<br/><br/>There have been countless spin-offs, rip-offs and copies of 'Alien', but they all amount to no more than cheap B-grade, schlock-horror imitations.<br/><br/>Unlike that prevalent in many of the above-mentioned films, in 'Alien', gore and profanity is kept to a minimum. These factors lend the film a higher degree of credibility, making it more believable and even more chilling. As we all know, it is what we do NOT know and see (including the alien's killing modus operandi) that is truly frightening.<br/><br/>When Weaver's character 'Ripley' is racing against time, your heart will be racing, when she is glancing fearfully into the ship's claustrophobic dark corners, your eyes will be searching the corridors too - unless they are squinting from behind barely spread fingers! Ripley enjoys no such luxury.<br/><br/>A third of a century after release, this film has lost none of its awesome ability to frighten the living daylights out of the viewer. See it!!"
"MrDudds","10","0","1","20 October 2012"," The Daddy of Suspense...
","If classic Hitchcock films such as 'Phsycho' are considered the godfather of suspense then this film at least deserves its title as a father of suspense.<br/><br/>For me, 'Alien' sets out in stone how every horror/thriller film should aim to be. OK I didn't have sleepless nights after, but the viewing of the film had my pulse rate through the roof.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott manages right from the start to create an eerie atmosphere of pure dread. Right from the word go, you can tell something doesn't feel right even when they haven't even picked up their....'Visitor'.<br/><br/>The Alien itself is designed to perfection by Giger. Truly an emotionless, remorseless, soulless killing machine. It's what adds a new horrifying dimension to our villain. Knowing the crew members have no way in which to reason or bargain with it; multiples the fright-factor.<br/><br/>The acting of course is top notch; not a single bad performance from anyone. The tensions between crew members feels totally realistic and their reactions towards the ongoing dilemma are too, very believable.<br/><br/>The setting is what really makes the film though. The ship feels modern but at the same time: grimy and frankly, claustrophobic. It really is what fortifies the idea that you are more frightened of what you can't see.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the pacing. The first half of the film is pretty slow. However it is this that very reason the tension builds so well. The problem is when things really start to get going the story goes VERY FAST! After the first gruesome encounter things go downhill for the crew pretty quick. In fact it feels a tad rushed. But then again it does sort of give a sense of panic and adrenaline.<br/><br/>I guarantee you that at some point during your viewing of 'Alien', your heart-rate WILL have increased and when the film reaches its fantastic climax you will be blown away.<br/><br/>Classic Sci-Fi horror! 8/10"

","Alien is a suspense film about a crew in space investigating life-form on an unknown planet and end up under attack by one of the native species. The movie is full of surprises keeping tensions high throughout the entire movie. Ridley Scott used many different things to make this movie as scary and stressful for the audience as possible. He uses things like lighting and sounds from the alien to keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole film. I was kind of excited before watching this movie because I have seen many suspense films but, never got around to watching this one before. When looking at it before viewing it, it looked like more of a Sci-Fi movie than a horror movie and that's not really what I'm interested in. After watching Alien I could see that it did have a lot of Sci-Fi elements, obviously with the people in deep space finding an alien that lays eggs inside people that pop out their chests. When looking into it deeper however it's actually a very intense and exciting movie. The fact that the alien had a means of getting around the ship without the crew knowing where he was made the alien that much more frightening. With the alien moving through the air ducts you never know who will be attacked next which really adds to the suspense of the film. Also it added the possibility of the captain going into the air ducts after the alien. This confined quarter trying to find an alien loose in your spaceship is a very scary thought. Having the air ducts for the alien to crawl through really added to the scariness of the movie. Sigourney Weaver was an excellent choice to portrait Ellen Ripley in my opinion. She was a sort of take charge make decisions type of character. It was easy to tell from the beginning that Ripley was the one who knew what was going on and made the smart choices for every situation. The way Weaver played the character knowing what's best and taking charge really gave the made the character more relatable, and made the movie as a whole a lot better. When they let the alien in to the ship you could really see that she was concerned and didn't want this to happen. Weaver was a great actress to cast for this character. In Alien the lighting was used especially in toward the end of the movie to really enhance the experience of the movie. This is very much the case when they are trying to escape the main ship and set off the self-destruct action on the ship. This causes the lights to go on and off constantly like a strobe light so you can't really see what's going on. Due to this you never know if the alien is right next to her or if he's not even in the shot. Also the sounds of the alien kind of added to the movie as well. Whenever you here the screeching sound of the alien you know something bad is going to happen. This was made clear when Ripley is on the escape ship thinking she got away then you hear the alien. This is a very creepy knowing that its close quarters now. These two aspects combined make for a very scary experience. The way in which the alien got into the ship is very scary as well. Having an unknown creature stick to your face and lay eggs inside you is weird enough, and then having it burst through your chest makes it even worse. I think using this instead of having the alien sneak onto the ship or something makes it so much scarier. This just isn't what is expected and really grosses out and scares the audience. Considering the fact that this movie was made in nineteen seventy-nine the alien creature is very realistic. This is what makes the movie believable and keeps the audience interested. This has to be very hard with Sci-Fi movies because none of the things happening in these movies have ever happened and probably never will happen. Looking at how the alien appears though helps the audience to see this as a real thing that could happen. When watching this movie just keep in mind that it's all fake and will probably never happen."
"layouth2015","Null","0","3","1 October 2012"," Alien (1979)
","This is a horror movie mixed with science fiction. A long travel in space and landing on an unknown planet is quite surreal; the addition of an alien being wanted on earth is unimaginable. The author did well incorporating both a scary side with abnormal. The nature and setting of the movie was ideal in creating the fear. This crew of 7 people returning back to earth in their spaceship happens to stop on another planet. In principle, their stop was supposedly to check out what was an SOS signal however, it was planned by the organization that sent them out; as they were in search of an indestructible alien. Firstly, I believe that the limited setting managed to keep the viewers on their toes. Because they landed on an extremely dark planet with limited lighting, we were in suspense wondering what could pop out at anytime. In horror movies, the daylight means respite from any dangerous attacks however with the constant darkness, there was no hiding from danger. The characters curiosity also plays a part. Despite almost being obliged to explore the planet, they felt the need to go explore the spaceship. Plus, Dallas and Ash were okay keeping the alien on board to examine it. This keeps the suspense because they need to find out extra on an unknown planet. Thus we never knew what to expect except for something sinister. Knowing that the humans were solely in the spaceship meant that the alien could have popped out of anywhere whether they expected it or not. Meaning they had nowhere to run. To be effectively scary, the rotation of sinister sounds and silence has to be perfect. I believe the silence in this movie was at times over-exaggerated. The movie starts off with lots of silence till we find the crew who are all inside that cabin. At the same time, when the alien comes into action, things become more interesting. The sounds make us guess when the alien will strike - the different moments of silence and sounds keep you edgy. You think the alien will strike then some seconds later you don't. I think the way the crew members communicate also builds up to the death of most of the crew members. There is some negative communication amongst the members. Examples are breaking of the quarantine rules. Their lack of trust in one another leaves the viewers haggling over who to believe and who to be suspicious of. We also make up our minds about who will be first to get killed because of their active or inactive parts in the movie. I did not see Ash getting killed by the alien because he seemed relaxed and almost happy to have it on-board; at the same time, I saw Brett getting killed because he barely said a thing. The roles played defined who got killed and who survived longer. I think the background sounds were orchestras playing. Sometimes, the strings (violin) seemed to be the more obvious sounds but they mostly sound like symphonies. These somber noises are to create the scary atmosphere. In between the long silences, you hear a lot of those sounds. Even before the alien came into the fold, there were those sounds. However, around the moment Ripley defeats the alien, we get the integration of softer music. Obviously, after she rids herself of the alien, the soft music keeps going. This changes the mood from the usual scary suspense to victory. Along with the soft sounds, Ripley is dressed in all white when she kills the alien. The movie is extremely dark all the way through but around the time she will be victorious, she puts on the spacesuit. To also kill it with a sort of white blast is interesting. We see the integration of the white when she wins. The only other person who wore white was Ash but we found out that he was a bad guy. I believe the white signified hero in Ripley's case but it also pointed out that Ash was not a good guy because everyone was dressed in more tattered clothes with darker colors. This guy was out of the ordinary. <br/><br/>I believe the movie drags on. It takes an hour of the movie to get the alien fully grown and causing terror inside the space shuttle. This results in a limit of action. In reality, there were not many moments of fright except for when the alien was going to strike. To better the situation, the characters could have encountered the alien then managed to escape. The lack of talk also adds to that so the movie is kind of boring to a certain extent. There is not really much to look forward to. However, when the alien did come into play, I easily misjudged who the main character was. I saw Ash dying because of his negativity however I thought Dallas would be the last man standing. He was quite brave and the fact that he went after the alien but there was no blood or a body after he met with the creature, I expected him to suddenly re-appear. That would be a classic situation in a suspense movie when someone we thought was dead suddenly comes back into the story and ends up being the hero. Finally, I believe that the cat, Jones was almost a symbol of death. We do not see the cat till when they start looking for the alien inside the spaceship. When Brett had to chase it down because it escaped, he was the first to get killed by the alien. Around the end, when Ripley has the cat in her arms, Parker and Lambert get killed. Finally, when they enter the shuttle after blowing up the spaceship, the cat gets placed in its little shelter. Then the alien suddenly is in the shuttle too. However, her being the sole survivor left meant that she managed to rid herself of the creature."

We see a space ship that is impressive looking to the audience but we can tell from how beat up it looks on the outside, even the title of the spaceships words are faded; so it's obviously seen better days. Even the inside of the ship isn't any better looking, from bad lighting, constant mechanical problems like in one scene landing gear breaks like a toothpick when they land on a planet; some computers are out of order and might be dated looking. It sort of reflects the characters state of mind. But that lighting also almost give the film sort of a Gothic sensibility.<br/><br/>The other thing that works are the characters they all look and act like everyday people. None of them are really handsome or beautiful looking (well except of Sigonrey Weaver as Ripley). Let alone all of them are adults and I like that as opposed to the pretty boy girl look which I can't stand or everyone being teens which is getting really old. I really like how all of them play it straight and seem to be blue collar types; we see from their conversations despite being in space all of them are bored or had enough and simply just want to go home and get paid. And when their given the task to explore a newly discovered planet according to their company regulations to explore the planet, most of them have bored and tired expressions on their faces let alone groan as if another school assignment is being handed to them. Wonder if there was ever a moment in ""Star Trek"" where one day Kirk and crew had to explore another planet, Spock would say fascinating, but might really be thinking boring. But their all well rounded you actually care about them and hope that at least one of them will make it.<br/><br/>This helps give us the sense of reality of this world of tomorrow and what it has come to. A future where bureaucracy and greed are in control and are playing with people's lives to suit their own selfish and meaningless gains, advanced technology decaying from age, and possibilities becoming limited.<br/><br/>Still this world of tomorrow is fascinating and when the characters arrive on the alien planet it doesn't disappoint. The production value is just magnificent because it's all practical hand built, as we see some organic gigantic space craft. And the mystique it contains where we see some giant looking at some telescope and there are eggs beneath, what could those eggs be there for, an experiment gone wrong, their own discovery turned against them who knows.<br/><br/>The Alien crate as well as the space craft an everything in it was inspired and designed by my favorite artist H.G. Gigger who always had a style of making surrealistic, dark, organic, sometimes mechanical creatures and structures all making a bizarre, exotic, grotesque, beautiful blend. Just like the design and behavior of the creature which seems to be a bizarre blend of a lot of things with the animalistic destructive qualities which make it all the more terrifying. We only get flashes and glimpses of the monster to make the presence of evil hidden and a powerful force to be reckoned with. The fact the ship has poor lighting, claustrophobic and isolated setting doesn't help much which gives the alien more advantage. Even in moments when were in the safe zone away from the creature we don't feel safe because we know it could be anywhere and hit us anytime. When it hits the results are nasty, that chest burster scene the first time I saw it made me sick luck I didn't eat anything.<br/><br/>The cat and mouse game is all about tension where literally feel like your the cat in some places, the mouse in others. The music score from the late great Jerry Goldsmith, is just superb it is one of my favorite suspenseful scores. This helps in the suspenseful build up till at the very last moment when you least expect it, the cat comes in for the kill. My favorite scene which scared the hell out of me was the air duct hunt scene. That part literally made me claustrophobic and afraid of the dark, the use of the sound of that radar really put me on red alert the whole time. And it's suspense just built up till I actually jumped or moved back in my seat, it's that scary.<br/><br/>Space is a deep dark place full of possibilities and danger where no one can help you.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

","Well it got one! I have seen this movie so many times but it never gets old. There are critics of the movie who would say its just a typical slasher flick in space and when you break it down yea that may be true. However, when you add in the alone on the ship factor with dark tight spaces with a creature you know very little about other than its ""great defense mechanism"" this ""slasher flick"" outdoes all others. Add a great musical score to add the tension great acting and some extremely intense scenes it is no wonder this has been a classic for many years. Not to mention h.r. Gingers designs throughout the film including what I believe to be one of the most terrifying movie monsters ever. I sometimes wonder if there was a remake of it how it would compare and most likely would not at all have the same impact simply because the audience would know what's coming. In fact there is a scene early on in the movie that the director did not want the actors to know what was going to happen to get the real shock effect. Of course some aspects of the movie are dated but that's inevitable and it doesn't damage the movie for me. I love it for its intense dark claustrophobic feeling and knowing something deadly may be around any corner."

","The set design and visual effects in this movie are incredible. Not just for the time that this film was created but yet it still holds true today, and it is true also for the sequels that follow. The story line and character development for this first, and in my opinion brilliant, film are far superior to all of the sequels including the most recent prequel Prometheus in 2012. Each and every character is written and acted so well as opposed to the sequels that follow in which Sigourney Weaver is the only actor/actress who provides solid acting throughout.

","""In space, no one can hear you scream."" The crew on the spaceship Nostromo has a Jaws like experiences with an alien. This makes it a real thriller movie, but this time it takes place in outer space. It showed the future of space travel to standards of people who just found out about space travel. The lead character is played by Sigourney Weaver who played in all three sequels of Alien and has also plays Dr. Grace Augustine in Avatar. These sequels are Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien. In each of these films Sigourney Weaver is the only recurring character which fights for survival and tries to keep the alien from getting back to Earth. However she didn't play in the two prequels: Alien vs. Predator and Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem. Ridley Scott has directed many other movies of which the most recent one is Prometheus.<br/><br/>Alien starts with a true Star Wars beginning, a big view of outer space and one small spaceship approaching. This spaceship is the Nostromo coming home from a mining expedition for the Company. The crew of the ship is in a hibernation state when the ship's main computer answer a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. The crew sets out to find the source of the signal because they are supposed to react to a possible life form and bring it home to planet Earth. After bringing in the alien and accidentally letting it escapes. This result in a fight for survival while they are being hunted down one by one. This makes it a typical thriller movie.<br/><br/>The setting of the movie is has been chosen really well, both the Nostromo spaceship and the alien spaceship feel like a real spaceship. However since this movie was made during a time when technology was still developing, this causes a lot of old effects in the movie. For example the instrument panel contained a lot of blinking lights and weird buttons which look really childish. This childish effect makes the technological aspects of the ship look very cheap. They even had to use children to play scene where they needed a bigger set than they could afford. These children did a great job playing the astronauts.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie music plays an important role to create suspense. In a thriller movie this is very important because if you play a child's song during an attack of the alien you will not be scared, but you will laugh at the alien. The music is able to create suspense or make the actors move quickly. This makes you feel like the alien is also right behind you and it makes you want to run away as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>A movie is not just about how the movie is edited, but mainly if the actors are able to convince the audience that their fear or joy is real. In this movie the different type of actors create a perfect mix to make everyone have one person to relate to. The character of Lambert played by Veronica Cartwright is the type of person that is scared of everything. She does this very well and her screams sound real and convincing. One of her screams is in fact real, because the director did one scene without telling the actors exactly what was going to happen. Then during the filming when the unexpected explosion of blood occurred she almost fainted because of fear, but luckily the rest of the actors stayed in their role while being scared at the same time by the blood. This created a true illusion of fear.<br/><br/>In this movie costume design is very important. The costume for the alien, the space suits for both the children and adults and the normal day clothes had to be made to perfectly match the scene of the movie. The alien's costume was very difficult to make because they wanted to create something that did not look like a humanoid alien. They were not very successful at this, but through using other techniques like camera work they were able to compensate for this problem. The spacesuits of both the children and the adults were other big problems because of the high temperature and the lack of oxygen in the suit. This was major concern because the people in the suits would only be able to perform for a short while in the suits without fainting. In the end the costumes look great in the movie.<br/><br/>In a movie where not everything is perfect camera work is very important. This is because the camera is able to make things look different than they really are. The camera work in this movie is used very effectively. This is most noticeable in the scene with the children. They used a different distance than they normally would use to create an effect where everything looked bigger than it was in reality. Also in the close encounters with the alien the camera is never pointed directly at the alien to make the humanoid features of the alien less noticeable.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is a good combination of different techniques. The use of special effect was outstanding when the movie was first made, but nowadays the special effects look really normal and sometimes even old. However if you look through these special effects you will see a terrifying movie which shows a possible future of space travel which we are still not capable of nowadays. The actors did a very great job in transferring their fear towards the audience."

","An opportunity to watch Alien in the cinema on the day of its premiere, not knowing anything about it prior to the screening, just to be able to experience it in all its suspenseful glory – that would definitely be my biggest wish if I could have one.<br/><br/>However, even though most of the mystery behind its thrilling story has been spoiled for me some time before I had a chance to see Ridley Scott's creation, I was still overwhelmed by its unearthliness, and simply left speechless in the end.<br/><br/>Probably everything that's to be said about Alien has been said already. The uncontested fact that it's an essential science fiction will remain true throughout the history. Ridley Scott changed to way most people look at this genre and started a trend that many directors wanted to follow. That shouldn't surprise anyone, knowing that a picture like this comes only a few times in the history.<br/><br/>The director was capable of creating and developing a frantically majestic universe, in which he placed the whole story about the horrible adventure of the Nostromo mining ship. No one can deny that the method Mr. Scott used to hypnotize the viewers continues to be fresh and very original even now, more than 30 years ago.<br/><br/>The masterful editing of the movie creates a visually perfect atmosphere that is able to draw attention and scare in the most stunning, and intelligent way. Combined with the eerie music and the specific, very dark and sombre tone in most of the scenes, they create an unforgettable movie experience.<br/><br/>The fact that the extraterrestrial creature, which roams around the ship killing all of the passengers one after another, is shown only for a slight second accounts for the fact that the movie is more fascinating and riveting. It isn't like in most of the horrors that we are used to, where the killer is constantly on-screen, running around and murdering his victims in an absurd manner. No, the way the Alien does it is utterly distinctive. He does it quietly, without any unnecessary exposures. The viewer is waiting for him to show up, but he never does. All we see is the empty corridors, surrounded by a gloomy fog of uncertainty.<br/><br/>The seven passengers try everything to get rid of the uninvited guest. Unfortunately, in an encounter with the mysterious monster they are hopeless, and it seems that their ship would be lost in the vast space for all eternity. This is the moment when an unexpected hero emerges. Or a heroine, I should say. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was able to handle the situation, being left alone after all the other crew members have been killed. She stayed put, in control of the situation, and outsmarted the creature in the final sequence.<br/><br/>In the person of Sigourney Weaver the world finally got a strong and brave woman, who was able to withhold any devastating circumstances and still fight when all hope seemed to have been lost. Her performance is breathtaking, so real and believable that when she fears for her life every person watching her is scared to death too.<br/><br/>The visual and special effects (sadly, the only Oscar that the movie got) are on the highest level all the time - the opening scene showing the enormous universe surrounding Nostromo; when it lands on a distant planet just to discover another life form; during the tantalizing on-board hunt.<br/><br/>The scene of a bursting stomach, when a little Alien is born will come down in history as one of the most memorable ever.<br/><br/>All in all, the spellbinding atmosphere, the unconventional tone, the remarkable story, the well- developed characters, the unexpected twists, the thrilling suspense, the mystery behind the unknown (the list could just go on and on) – all of those factors put together give reason for calling Alien one of the best science-fiction movies of all times. If you haven't seen it already, do it know."

","When a film involves a group of astronauts stranded on a distant planet, lost connection to Earth and are up against aliens, they are probably trying (and probably failing) to copy this film. Ridley Scott was a fairly unknown director at the time but now he is up there as one of the best thanks to this film.<br/><br/>From the get go, it is intense without any dialogue, people or anything really. Just steady shots of machinery and corridors in complete silence but it still has a fear essence to it. The plot is fairly simple. A group of people in a commercial towing spaceship get a distress call form a planet and a loop hole in their contract states that they have to go and investigate; on the planet, they find an alien type body and let chaos ensue.<br/><br/>The first act is fairly slow which can become of distaste to some viewers who want to see action and horror. I personally enjoyed the slowness because it is a slow build up to what is going to be a tense forty five minutes. Plus, the slowness of the film allows us to care for the characters because classic horror film scenario: people die. We know this and because of that, we do not care for the characters but in this film, when their eating at the dinning table with their banter and natural conversations, we really care for them.<br/><br/>The acting is superb from everyone so there is not time where you cringe at a line delivered poorly or an action looking robotic. But the real star of the film is Ridley Scott. The directing is something special and unique from the slow, steady shots to an intense shaky cam shot. It flips from one to another flawlessly. I recommend everyone to watch this film but I must warn you, if you hate slow films, give this a chance and it might convert you or just leave it and watch Transformers."

","'Alien' set the bar for sci-fi and even horror films long after it was released. It's always remained a very popular film which is quite unusual for movies in general to still be considered excellent over three decades since its release. <br/><br/>Ridley Scott's direction of this film is excellent of course. The atmosphere built up during the events in this film are great, the acting works very well too, Sigourney Weaver doesn't have a great presence in the film until the second half but she really makes up for it during the last hour. Other performances such as that of Veronica Cartwright are good but you can't help but wonder why their character is included in the story at all. <br/><br/>The story is very interesting, when you first watch this film it can really shock you and can certainly make you jump on more than one occasion. However, because 'Alien' is so well-known and famous now, it will be difficult for someone not to have an idea about what it consists of so I guess not many people will find it as shocking as it was 30 years ago.<br/><br/>Nevertheless 'Alien' is still a very good film, it's still scary in some parts and is considered to be an excellent film regardless of its now out-dated technology used. <br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend this film to anyone, if you're a fan of science fiction or horror you should have already seen this film anyway but if you haven't, watch it."

","The first Alien franchise I saw was resurrection in the 1997, and I always craved to see what led to it.<br/><br/>In 1979, with the aid of great cinematography Ridley Scott directed the first Alien film, and I have to be honest after you get over the first 50 minutes, the movie had all it takes to make you quiver. You may not appreciate the graphics but I can tell you one thing, they pulled it off.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver, I just have to say, what a classic actress she is, she made sure the facial expressions and the reactions were enough to make you the viewer just wish she quits already.<br/><br/>I have to give this movie thumbs up for execution, nice story build up all leading to the inevitable, an Alien on board the ship.<br/><br/>Ian Holm played Ash, which with the help of the editor, pulled off some classic film trick to convince you of his predicament.<br/><br/>The scenes that had the alien, had to be done with lighting and camera work to convince you of the threat. In this present day this is done with acting and the alien present introduced later on. The actors do a lot of work in the area of performance to convince you that they are scared of what they cannot see, of what will be CG included in post production.<br/><br/>But back then the cinematographer and the director had to find away to convince you that the figure you are seeing is threatening, what I have to say Ridley Scott did a fine job of.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, a crew is sent on a science exploration in space, they pick up a signal and divert to see what it was (they didn't really want to but it was against their contract), only for one of the crew to get infected by an Alien, they bring him onboard to help him and all hell breaks loss.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of seeing things done back in the day, try this for size.

","This terrifyingly suspenseful film has it all--solid plot line, terrific cast, and a level of suspense that its many imitators (like that Schwarzenegger thing with that midwestern governor) can only dream off. The movie scared the living fertilizer out of me the first time I saw it--and that was in a well-lit room, on a small screen, with a dozen people around me! This movie rightfully made Sigourney Weaver a star, and the supporting cast is excellent. Ian Holm is absolutely chilling as the science officer Ash, and the sequence in which Parker (Yaphet Kotto, one of the most underrated actors of our time) and Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) confront the alien is brilliant. Cartwright in particular gets the human-in-the-alien's-headlights look just perfect--her eyes get incredibly wide and her body just locks into place. Hearing the result over Ripley's comlink is much more effective than seeing it would have been.<br/><br/>One of the best ever!!"

","Well, ""Alien"" is considered a cult horror classic for most people due to the impact it had when released and the impact it still causes when you watch it. I believe the main reason to this film be that high rated is the directing. Ridley Scott is marvelous; he is able to entertain, scare, shock and at the same time, give the spectator a good time. This film runs away from every possible cliché-- which is a hard thing to see in a horror film. There are some shocking scenes, such as the alien coming out of Kane's body in dinner table. In fact, I don't believe in such thing as aliens, but still felt horrified in this scene, so I can imagine how scared alien believers must have felt. Sigourney Weaver is excellent in doing her job, I didn't know she was that good. I also didn't know that they had such great technology back in 1979; special effects are well done and impressive at times. My only complaint is that the alien spends too few time on screen, but it doesn't spoil the film's overall quality. It is indeed an horror classic!"

","An austere, despairing vision that far from finding any wonder or beauty in space instead dares to find a universe of limitless horror. 'Alien' remains the ultimate fusion of the horror and sci-fi genres.<br/><br/>Its underlying fascination lies in its keynote title. No film has ever imagined anything as uniquely, unsettlingly 'alien' as this. Not just the monster itself - a parasitical predator that has fine-tuned Darwinian adaption to the ultimate in survival - but also the derelict spaceship which harbors the egg from which it springs, after waiting millennia in gestation. No one has ever bettered designer HR Giger's concept of complete non-human otherness.<br/><br/>This was only Ridley Scott's second feature. His highly acute visual style (developed after years as a leading director of UK commercials) brilliantly establishes mood. His direction of drama is detached, almost eavesdropped in snippets, not allowing the audience to get too close to the protagonists. It's an approach that keeps the narrative single-mindedly on track.<br/><br/>And the tone is relentlessly bleak. The Nostromo's crew inhabit a dehumanized industrial complex of a spacecraft with few concessions to comfort. Among them there seems to be little more than indifferent companionship. The planet they visit is a hellish world of ferocious storms, smothering vapor and barren terrain. Jerry Goldsmith's music is correspondingly sparse, almost grudging in conceding any high notes.<br/><br/>Everyone remembers John Hurt's famous stomach-churning demise. But perhaps the most telling shot in the film is the one of Jones, the ship's cat, peeking out from behind a corner as the Alien devours a victim, feline eyes glinting in wary fascination at a primal scene it can empathize more instinctively than its hapless companions..."

","IMDb Top 250: 44 Not usually a horror guy, I decided I wanted the full Alien experience when I saw this. After all, it's Halloween in 2 days. I started at midnight, alone in my basement with all the lights off.<br/><br/>Alien has not aged well.<br/><br/>The original isolation movie, Alien follows the crew of the Nostromo as they investigate a distress call and deal with the titular Alien. As said before, it was original for its time, but now it doesn't fare so well.<br/><br/>A looming problem I had with Alien was that a lot of it was boring and not scary. I, one to usually turn down the volume and squint at the screen during scary parts, sat right through this. And while I understand that tension is necessary and a slow first act builds that, the film would come grinding to a halt for sections throughout the second and third act, and the horror is lost.<br/><br/>There are still scary scenes though. The crashed ship, the famous meal, and my personal scariest, the air vent live up to the hype of 'the scariest sci-fi ever'.<br/><br/>The Alien itself is terrifying, in part because we never see the whole of it. Its design is brilliant. Unfortunately, we never get to see in detail what it does to its prey. In one of my favourite games, F.E.A.R., you are terrified of a little girl because every so often she explodes people and other gruesome things. In my arguably favourite horror, The Thing, you see very graphically what the Thing does. Both of these make you scared of the monster. Alien never gives you physical proof that the Alien is voracious. Even just once, a more violent death could've raised the terror. The Thing did it more than once only 3 years later, so the argument ""it was a different time"" isn't exactly valid. And Alien could've been gorier. The dinner, with the chestburster and terrific acting by the victim, was very tense.<br/><br/>I know the plot isn't the point of the film, but it could've been fleshed out. Who are these people, what are they doing? What is the company they work for? I know the lore expands in Aliens, but the story of Alien is too contained.<br/><br/>I know the point of the characters is to die, but it's hard to feel for them. Brett doesn't do much, Parker only cares for money, and Lambert is unbearable to watch. I only cared about Ripley, Dallas (the one with the plan who is rational) and the cat.<br/><br/>So yes, Alien disappointed me. It's a very good sci-fi movie, but the horror wasn't as good as I expected. The best thing it can do is raise its hand and say, ""First!"" 8.2/10"
"Steffi_P","9","0","1","21 October 2011"," ""I admire its purity""
","The sci-fi movie, by the late 1970s was a very clean, bright-looking genre. In the likes of Star Wars, Star Trek space travel was all about gleaming corridors and friendly swishing doors. Aliens were generally friendly, as in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or if they weren't at least they were only trying to shoot you with a ray-gun, not bite your face off in some dank corridor. With Alien, the sci-fi genre reacquired that sense of horror and paranoia which it had had in its 1950s heyday.<br/><br/>The look of the thing is all-important here. The design team have created an environment that looks suitably space age-y but also very gritty and industrial, with an emphasis on tight enclosure. The room of the ""mother"" computer is easily the brightest, yet its low, curved ceiling makes it incredibly claustrophobic. Director Ridley Scott often keeps his camera amid the clutter. In the opening scene before the crew awaken, he sets up the feeling of eeriness with various indistinct movements in the depths of the set. Throughout the movie Scott integrates simple elements of light and sound – squeals, clanks, flashes – and his sense of timing really makes this a triumph of horror. One of the great things about the production design and the way Scott shoots it is that the creature often blends into the paraphernalia, creating several surprise moments where we realise it was in plain view all along.<br/><br/>Another brilliant thing about Alien is that the crew of the Nostromo don't look like a set heroic, uniformed space pioneers. They look – and act – like ordinary people doing their job. Although there isn't much room for dramatics here, there are many fine performances from the cast. Ian Holm does well, all things considered, throwing a believable inhuman streak into the mix. Veronica Cartwright is ostensibly the token screaming female, but she plays it with surprising realism and dignity. But best of all is Sigourney Weaver. The part was originally written for a man, and while heroic women in action movies are quite de rigueur now, compare Ripley to any other female character from a mainstream 70s movie, and you see the context Weaver was working in. And yet her performance is strong and confident enough that she seems completely natural in the tough, assertive role.<br/><br/>Stunning and innovative as it is, Alien remains something of a one-off. Although many 80s sci-fi movies adopted that dark, dingy look, they were typically more action-orientated affairs, most notably the sequel itself, Aliens. Such an even balancing of contemporary horror and sci-fi was not really attempted again. Alien remains a brilliantly constructed work in a field of its own."
"compi24","8","0","1","21 October 2011"," Review Of ""Alien""
","Yeah, not really sure this movie needs an introduction, but here it comes anyway. ""Alien"" is a 1976 Ridley Scott directed Sci-Fi Horror flick starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, a warrant officer on a mining ship that begins to encounter strange creatures. Now, It's hard for me to say that I haven't seen ""Alien"" up until this point, but it's true so I'll cop to it. After seeing it, I can safely say that everyone I talked to was right - I missed a lot. ""Alien"" is a really great film, crafted by one of the greatest revolutionary living directors. Ridley Scott really shows his keen ability to develop unbelievable tension through almost every scene. I had to turn down the volume on my television at some points, because I was almost certain that something was going to pop up and scare the seven shades of poop outta' me. But that's the thing, it didn't always happen when I expected it to. This is something that horror movies today seem to fail to accomplish - in a sense, they give away when the jump scares are going to happen. ""Alien"" really excels at blurring the line between the moments when you're sure a jump scare'll happen and the moments when they won't. The story, written by the legendary Dan O'Bannon is often cited as the influence for numerous other Sci-Fi Horror films and stories. This story is the fulcrum of the film, and O'Bannon's ability to create unending tension via the narrative is really a noteworthy skill. The cinematography and lighting also really helps in creating intense strain on the audience. At one point in the film, it seems as though cinematographer Derek Vanlint uses strobe lights for lighting. This jarring effect, once again, keeps the audience intensely stressed out. The sounds in the film are really very eerie, as the unnerving creaking sounds of the Nostromo and the shrill shriek of the Alien still resonate in my head. Sigourney Weaver does a great job in one of her very first (and arguably most memorable) roles. H.R. Giger's set and costume design really shines in this film, possibly establishing the Sci-Fi Horror aesthetic as we know it. In the end, I found Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" to be an awesomely frightening film that effectively exudes the overwhelming amount of skill that was placed into it."

","The trailer from Alien let you know you weren't in Kansas anymore: In space, no one can hear you scream."" Released on year after Star Wars, Alien became the antithesis of the blockbuster film. While Star Wars, emphasized good versus evil with the good guys winning, Alien brooded darkness and claustrophobia. <br/><br/>When the crew of the ship Nostromo receives a distant signal they go to investigate, but the signal turns out to be a SOS.

It's so slowly paced and lifeless at times that it's a struggle to stay invested in what's going on, hardly inventive at all since these are where it's money-makers are spent, the building-up of the suspense in what's going to happen next. Giving a reason to remain in a state of suspense is just as important as the release, and this one forgets to do that constantly. You also have the fact that this one barely contains anything about the alien, either featuring scenes of it or getting to know it, that there's just such a dearth of knowledge about what it's doing that there's very little beyond the physical, which is pretty impressive admittedly, to really get worked up with this one over. As mentioned, the psychical appearance of the creature is really the film's best idea, suitably foreign and extraterrestrial in concept and execution and looking quite imposing when first viewed with some really nice features about it that make it something to be feared. It also has a few rather fun shock scenes that are quite impressive, which are well-known and won't be repeated and the stalking scenes in the later half are really suspenseful, so there is some good stuff here, but overall this is still somewhat overrated.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and animals in danger."

","After watching Alien, I was amazed. It was different from the movies I was used to in every way possible. The Chestburster scene had been shocking even though I expected it. This movie, to me, was more than an average horror movie because of it's blend of black comedy and violence. John hurt did very well at the Chestburster. When they kill Ash, I was surprised that he was a robot. Sigourney Weaver also did an amazing job acting.It pushed away from what was expected of movies and was proud of it. I liked it because it did not focus on being violent like most horror movies. Instead it focused on being suspenseful. I don't want to spoil too much, but definitely watch it if you like suspense!"

","""Why don't you guys freeze him? How come they don't freeze him?""<br/><br/>Alien. One of the movies that made history. One of the movies that every single Sci-Fi movie has copied, cloned or ripped off ever since. Or worse: made fun of.<br/><br/>This is the story of how humanity met the purest, most perfect killer anybody has ever seen before. Or since. It is the story of the commercial starship Nostromo, on it's way back to Earth with a cargo of minerals and a crew of idiots.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the huge ship waking up to respond to a signal of some sort, which for some reason the crew has to investigate and identify. And because they could not find a better reason, they thought of a very compelling one: money. ""You investigate, or you go home empty handed"". Which after a very, very long mission would have been very unfortunate, I guess. Sure, they start to want to go home shortly after that but... no, I won't say anymore.<br/><br/>Watching this movie more than 30 years after it's premiere, I would say it is not much of a movie. It is long - too long - the sets look like they are some sort of oil rig or refinery or something, the music is lame, the sound is uneven (to be polite), the story is ridiculous, the monster is great but very shy, nothing is really up to expectations, it is one big bad movie.<br/><br/>The actors do a fine job with the story they've got, which calls for them to be and behave like truckers. Truckers in space, should have been called. Tom Skerritt is the captain, John Hurt is the guy with the death wish (also second in command), Sigourney Weaver is the third in command, Ian Holm is the forth in command (kidding, he's the science officer, actually), Veronica Cartwright is the damsel in distress and the other two guys are not payed as much as the others so... just ignore them; everybody else does. There is a cat, too. Very important.<br/><br/>Many have said that this movie has a lot of star power, but I suspect that they were not that much of a star, back in the day. I mean... they only had a few TV movies under their belts, so they couldn't have been all that... shiny, including the director - Ridley Scott. And the fact that all of them have confirmed and went on to become big successful stars makes this movie even more fascinating.<br/><br/>The characters are overaged, out of shape (with one notable exception), they have lousy self preservation instincts and they have even lousier logic. Unfortunately I know people like that, which makes the characters very believable, no mater how crazy that is. I mean... I could see some people go: ""Oh my God, this is one huge creepy spaceship! I'm afraid to take one step further but I'm taking it! Oh my God, I could die out here but it is so fascination! Yeah! I'm taking one more step. Oh my God, I'm slipping! There is a huge egg thingy in front of me, why don't I just stick my face in it. Yeah, that seems like the smart thing to do...""<br/><br/>And the story continues to do all the wrong things for all the wrong reasons, even if some guy or another wants to know why they're doing it and other guy or another explains their reasons to do so. Which gets really annoying really fast, and after about the hundredth time they've done that I just gave up and started to fast forward a lot.<br/><br/>Alien. One great movie but... not that great. I understand the sequel was far better. 7/10."

","Alien is truly a work of art. Ridley Scott hand carved this monster in space epic from almost nothing, a fairly limp script and a budget that required some imagination. Scott delivered on every front and made this classic that I believe will live on well after Hollywood does a shoddy remake of it.<br/><br/>The manages suspense like no other, its music is so haunting and mellow that it murmurs beneath the surface until its ready to pounce. The pace is uncomfortable speed, in its first half very little happens and though it doesn't drag it pulls you along giving you just enough interest to keep you attached, but keeping the audience at an arms length to make u feel like you are a peeping tom, all the more creepy. The famous chest bursting sequence is where the film really kicks off and literally drives into a speed at which is relentless and horrifying.<br/><br/>The scenery in the film is just stunning. From Gigers towering and disturbing Alien set pieces to claustrophobic nostromo. Every inch of the film is thought through superbly, the scenery and the lighting and the music compliment every aspect as the film goes on. Sigourney Weaver is nothing short of amazing, her first major role was one that she would be remembered for forever. Ripley is the quintessential female action hero, a tough as nails captain that displays a ferocious side, but at the same time has a warmth and nurturing aspect that makes her oh so likable.<br/><br/>Alien's four sequels (I'm excluding Alien Vs Predator)all attempt a new take on the original film. The sequel Aliens captures something new, but retains the same feel of the original. Some argue it as better than Alien, but I disagree, Alien is unbelievably refined and well done, whereas Aliens offers a staggering action caper with a great weighted drama as well. Alien 3 is the major miss step in the franchise, but it still has some merit. And Alien: Resurrection tries something new and half achieves its goal, but I can't help thinking they could have gone further with it.<br/><br/>Alien is incredible, a classic film that all should see. And though not to everyones taste it is undeniable that this film has stood the test of time because its so damn good."

","In the future, a group of exploratory refinery workers are prematurely awakened from suspended animation to investigate what initially appears to be a distress signal emanating from an inhospitable planet. Once landed, the three crew members who investigate come across a mammoth derelict spacecraft housing leathery eggs, which spews forth a hostile alien life form that attaches itself to one the crew members. The fallen crew member is taken back to the mother ship for help and this becomes the precursor for all hell to break loose. Although by now near legendary, I will refrain from revealing more for any new viewers.<br/><br/>There are those that dismiss this film as being a glorified big-budget retread of It! The Terror from Beyond Space, but the film is infinitely more than that. I choose to think of it more as a rendition of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None set in outer space with a far more frightening nemesis than anything Christie imagined.<br/><br/>A lot must be said about the style and realism of the film. I believe this may well have been the first (or at least one of the first) science fiction films where the heroes were blue-collar workers rather than the proverbial scientists. The dialog and interaction among the various crew members is believable and engaging. H.R. Giger's alien designs are much-celebrated for a reason and very few have been able to come up with something as continually shocking. The creature is seen in various stages of evolution, with each one being a repellent yet oddly hypnotic realization.<br/><br/>Director Ridley Scott provides the tense and unrelenting atmosphere of the film. He also paces the film to perfection. It starts off slowly with a sense of creeping dread and then Scott ratchets up the suspense to a near unbearable crescendo. We are allowed to get to know each character and their quirks and share in their terror as they realize that their unwanted stowaway is a lot more dangerous and intelligent than they imagined. Scott makes effortless use of the dank dark confines of the spaceship, with its dripping water/coolant, tight spaces, oddly shaped doorways and clanking chains. It chronically seems as though something unspeakable is always on the verge of jumping out at one of the characters. Interestingly, although the film has a reputation for being violent - after the notorious ""chest-buster"" scene, Scott keeps the remainder of the deaths largely offscreen.<br/><br/>The cast fit well into their roles, with Tom Skerritt's stalwart captain and Ian Holm's icy scientist especially notable. However, acting-wise the film is deservedly known for allowing the previously unknown Sigourney Weaver to burst onto screens as the ever-resourceful, cool and intelligent Ellen Ripley. Ripley initially (and wisely) blends into the ensemble cast, but as the film progresses it becomes apparent that she will be the one to watch and will be the biggest obstacle to the alien. The fact that Weaver is also quite sympathetic and identifiable certainly helps the audience root for her.<br/><br/>The final moments of the film are sublimely exciting. The film was followed by James Cameron's equally legendary sequel, which struck out into new territory and became a classic in its own right and also cemented Weaver as an action heroine. Then the series was vivisected by David Fincher's audience-hating vomit Alien 3 and the barely better Alien: Resurrection, before lapsing into Alien vs. Predator nonsense. However, none of those atrocities can dim the brilliance of the original Alien and its sequel Aliens."

","Plot: The seven crewmembers of a commercial spaceship, wake up from their stasis and realize that they haven't yet reached earth. They receive a strange signal from a nearby planetoid, send some people to explore the signal's source and get attacked by a strange creature that attaches itself to one of the crewmembers.<br/><br/>You'll love Alien if: You want an extremely atmospheric Sci-Fi thriller, if you appreciate great props & SFX despite the movie's age and if you want to see great acting. The props and SFX certainly have a retro look however everything is surprisingly good, ""realistic"" and never over the top. The characters are terrific and diverse, played by great actors with Weaver doing a fantastic work. Part of the feeling of uneasiness that the movie achieves comes from the relationship of the characters which aren't exactly too friendly towards each other and from the spaceship they live in which looks more than a complex prison than a place to live. You can actually see the claustrophobic environment affecting the characters of the movie. The pacing of Alien is quite slow but this along with the scenery, the actors' great work and the clever use of sound\music, (or lack of), creates an astounding atmosphere, still undefeated by later Alien films. Finally the Xenomorph one of the most iconic creatures in cinema due to its wonderful design and mystery surrounding its existence. Very strong, extremely adaptable, without moral delusions a perfect killer. As a final word here's a little personal story: I watched this again after many years, but now with my girlfriend who is a girl who thinks of Fantasy\Sci-Fi as something that just goes well with popcorn. She is a also girl that whenever she sees a horror film like Saw, The Ring and so on mostly laughs(!?!). Alien however kept her on the edge of her seat, eyes and mouth wide open! Her reactions are my main reason why I am writing this review, because they were the reactions of a person who saw Alien for the first time in her life, not knowing what to expect and she enjoyed it very, very much!!!<br/><br/>You'll hate Alien if: You have a problem with its slow pacing, if you want a fast, action movie and maybe if you have seen another Alien movie before. The movie is very slow, so some people expecting something more adrenaline pumping will have a hard time seeing this one. Also people who have seen other Alien or AVP movies might get a bit disappointed by the ""inferior"" SFX, the very brief appearances of the Xenomorph, the lack of fast paced battles and the fact that you pretty much know everything about the creature. If you want a movie like that go watch Aliens, this one is a whole different thing Finally even though I love the movie more than any other Alien film it's the only one I have a hard time watching again because its value lies in viewers not knowing what to expect.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Classic Sci-Fi Thriller (8.7/10)<br/><br/>[+] Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Wonderful actors. Claustrophobic atmosphere. Greatly designed scenery and creatures. If my girlfriend loved it I don't know who won't :)<br/><br/>[-] Very slow pacing. Hard to re-watch too soon. Not for Action film fans.<br/><br/>Also Check: Cube (1997) – Event Horizon (1997) - The Fly (1986) - The Thing (1982)<br/><br/>P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say ""I like\don't like this movie"" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO..."

","Director Ridley Scott does a great job in this sci-fi classic of building suspense without resorting to much in terms of blood and gore or the normal sci-fi staple of futuristic weapons, etc., with much of the suspense being built by the wise decision to have the movie focus (the title notwithstanding) not on the alien, but on the crew of the Nostromo, a space freighter that investigates a signal it picks up that leads it to a hellish planet where it picks up an uninvited guest. The movie starts slowly. It gives the viewer a feel for the crew and who they are and the relationships that exist between them. Once on the planet, the atmosphere becomes one of mystery and then, with the introduction of the alien, it takes on that tense atmosphere that permeates most of the story.<br/><br/>Scott makes good use of the settings - the surface of the planet and then especially the dark and somewhat claustrophobic atmosphere of the bowels of the Nostromo, where the crew begins its search for the creature that's starting to pick them off one by one. We never really get a great look at the alien. It exists mostly in the shadows or in brief and partial shots, which adds to the mystery. The sense of hopelessness is palpable - this alien appears to be a perfect predator with no obvious weakness or vulnerability. <br/><br/>The performances were good. The star of the movie is clearly Sigourney Weaver. This was a very early role for her, and she handled being the star quite well, backed up by a number of familiar faces such as Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright and Harry Dean Stanton - none of them huge mega-stars, but a solid enough cast. Although I liked the way this movie was put together and enjoyed its atmosphere very much, I'm not sure there was enough in it to compel me to seek out the sequels, because I don't really see where the sequels could go except into a more traditional human vs. alien battle."

","To be honest, I do not know why I did not put 10 out of 10 for this title; knowing that perfection is like a myth, it is not supposed to exist. Still, ""Alien"" is one of the most famous movie that was ever made; this even applies today, in the twenty-first century, while, as we know, it belongs to the twentieth century. Indeed, with all these references in TV series, comics, shows, movies, music etc., it is impossible that you miss that one, especially when you like science-fiction (more than horror - you clearly see that the Alien is a puppet (it was not gonna be a real one dude!), and this, surely thanks to advantage of hindsight, curtails the overall ''horror'' aspect of the movie; to my mind, only a few elements in this movie are scary actually.) <br/><br/>The screenplay is simply astonishing, the action is yet quite slow, fortunately, and the visual is aging, but the overall effect is that it brings suspense rather than impatience. Sigourney Weaver, who embodies the young Ripley, is very convincing in the way she acts and reacts, and, unlike nowadays' movies, you cannot tell from the beginning who is going to survive and who is not. Even when you have seen AVP first (I was born in 1991 so that it was impossible for me to see Alien when it came out!), you have the impression to watch a different franchise that you are pleased to discover again and again. No, this movie is far from being boring, this movie is in fact a vintage and I hope that it will remain so, at least until the end of the world (2012 ? oops, that's another story...) <br/><br/>Believe me or not, when watching this film, I understood what the ""seventh art"" really was. There is little horror in this title, and do not come to the idea that Alien the first has something to do with the 2007 AVPR, in simple words, I see no relation between the two. If you do not know any of the Alien franchise yet, jump the shark and go buy the complete collection, it is cheap and you are sure to spend couples of hours watching one of the best movie ever made. Of course, you will have to forgive the lack of FXs... Obviously, the story is so good and the plot so immersive that you will not take heed of such a lack. Try it!"

","The tag went ""In space no-one can here you scream"", however thanks to hundreds of breakneck action movies (including this very film's first sequel) nowadays a better one might be ""for 90 odd minutes in space no-one can hear you yawn"".<br/><br/>That's not the movie's fault, if anything blame the reduced attention span that has meant I can watch a DVD in the ads of a sporting contest, while playing an Xbox game on split screen and absent mindedly net surfing on my laptop during load times and cutscenes.<br/><br/>And I'm only exaggerating just a little bit.<br/><br/>Alien showed that a quality film could be made using futuristic backgrounds and way out design concepts (by H.R. Giger; renowned lunatic genius), without a reduction in quality and realism. And with a horror theme to boot!<br/><br/>Alien finds the crew of the spacecraft Nostromo awoken from (let's call it) hypersleep to find they are not near Earth, as should be the case, but still in the middle of nowhere. The ship's computer named Mother has intercepted some sort of signal that has impelled them to cite a space directive saying they must reroute the mission to investigate.<br/><br/>The design of the ship is quite cool, things aren't all immaculate like most sci-fi films, and the crew actually has two ""blue-collar"" boys who look after the maintenance and engines, (and whinge about it 99% of the time). The high-tech stuff probably looked high-tech in the 80s, now it looks as futuristic as an Atari 2600 would to a kid with a PS3.<br/><br/>So after some grumping (and some scenes that serve little else but to highlight the ranking order in the ship and an insight into each character) it is agreed that they must take an unplanned detour to look into things and investigate the signal. The landing does not go smoothly unfortunately and the ship is damaged on landing on the moon's surface, three of the crew, Dallas, Lambert and Cain head off to find the source of the signal while Parker and Brett attempt to get the ship space-worthy, with Ripley and Ash staying aboard to supervise.<br/><br/>Now the action takes place with the research crew, as they near the signal they find an otherworldly structure, complete with what looks like a fossilized creature of some kind, and a lower area with hundreds of seed-pod looking things, only they are a metre tall and quiver when you near them. Cain accidentally falls into the pod area, and one of the pods opens in an ominous fashion.<br/><br/>Cut to shortly after as the three approach the ship, Cain being carried by this point. After an animated ""discussion between Dallas, Ripley and Ash regarding the suitability of allowing them access to the ship with a ""something else"" in tow, Cain is put into the medical bay where they can see exactly what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>Cain has a massive creature affixed to his face. No other way to say it. In truth I'd be ejecting him from the ship right now, complete with a eulogy of what a top bloke he was, after all no good can come from a massive creature being attached to your face, be it alien, animal or Kirstie Alley, (I know, low blow on an easy target).<br/><br/>In looking at the creature Ash finds some startling facts (for those that haven't seen the film nor any of its sequels), it has built in defense mechanisms, most notably acid for blood, and seems to be rummaging around inside Cain's body And they are still on the fence about ejecting him! The famous scene happens a little later, when Cain awakes seemingly no worse for wear, and the crew decide to have a little dinner party to celebrate a job well done before returning to hypersleep for the final leg home.<br/><br/>Commence Ash retching a bit, flailing for a few seconds, lying on his back and giving painful birth through his chest cavity to a bouncing baby alien, that looks about, has a quick scream to set the tone and promptly bolts while the crew look at each other. Fair enough too, that sort of thing doesn't happen every day.<br/><br/>The rest of the film involves the 6 survivors attempting to locate and destroy the being. They split into two teams initially (never a good idea), and set about hunting the thing down, perhaps in a large Tupperware container? Now seeing this isn't your ordinary pet it shouldn't have come as a massive shock to find our little 12 inch buddy is now well over 7 ft tall, and all in a matter of hours, our little guy is growing up fast! The scenes involving the gradual ""thinning out"" of the crew are quite effective, even if slow and deliberate by today's standards of wham-bam thank you ma'am's. The filmmakers utilize minimal music and allow the magnitude of the creatures development become gradually apparent to both the audience and the unfortunates who come across him.<br/><br/>There are a few ""Boo! Oh sh*t it's the stupid cat"" scares along the way, but thankfully these are kept to a minimum and the bulk of the tension is well earned, all the way to the very bitter end.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8 / 10. Undoubtedly a landmark in sci-fi and film in general, but so was the invention of the wheel more noteworthy at the time. Compared to what has come since this is still a solid 8 though.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

","Superficially, ""Alien"" is just like a slasher movie. A group of people are gathered some place for one reason or another, and are picked off one by one by some deadly foe. But there are a number of differences that separate this science fiction horror classic from your average slasher movie: an unbearably intense atmosphere and what is easily the most frightening creature ever to grace the silver screen.<br/><br/>A group of workers on a space mining ship Nostromo get a strange signal from a nearby planet. When they go out to investigate, something strange happens...<br/><br/>Of course, after over thirty years, it's probably safe to assume that anyone who is on the Internet Movie Database and reading one of the thousands of reviews of this classic has seen this movie, but because I don't feel that I have to go into any more detail, I won't. That being said, if you are reading this and actually HAVEN'T seen this movie, go and see it...primarily because you're going to get a classic freakout that few, if any movies can give you, but also because it's almost a sin for any movie lover to live with the fact that they haven't seen this movie.<br/><br/>This is more akin to movies like ""Halloween"" than ""Star Wars"" (two VERY different movies that came out within a year of each other), so like the John Carpenter classic, the acting rules that govern films like ""Star Wars"" or ""The Godfather"" do not apply. Nevertheless, it introduces us to the most famous action heroine, Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver. She's effective in the role, but there's no time or need for her to do anything else. Likewise, better known character actors Tom Skeritt, Ian Holm and John Hurt do the same. Lesser known actors Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright and Yaphet Kotto stay in their league. What's especially nice is that each individual is unique (though not three dimensional), which is something of a rarity in these kinds of movies.<br/><br/>There are two names that are responsible for most of the film's successes: H.R. Geiger and especially director Ridley Scott. Geiger, whose night terrors provided the inspiration for the Alien, deserves much credit. There is no other being that I can imagine that is more frightening than the Alien in this film. It's large, slimy, and extremely deadly.<br/><br/>But while Geiger created the creature, it was up to director Ridley Scott to create the atmosphere in which its potential for terror could be reached. And does he ever get us there! Scott's sense of atmosphere is impeccable. His use of long shots where characters appear small is extremely effective in getting us on edge. There are moments where we believe that something can jump out at us at any time, which is not an easy feat to accomplish. Some of the early scenes also recall something out of a horror film from the silent era; Hell was coined for scenes like these.<br/><br/>There is a reason why this film is hailed as a classic: it's dark, tense, and scary as hell!<br/><br/>Rated R for Monster Violence/Gore, Terror and Language."

","Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" can be counted among the most influential science fiction films of all time. Taking cues from earlier landmarks like ""The Thing From Another World"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Star Wars"", Scott created an atmospheric thriller capitalizing on the isolation of space. Thirty years and several sequels later the film remains impressive.<br/><br/>The story concerns a mining ship crew on their return to earth who investigate a possible S.O.S. on a remote planet. They stumble upon alien life forms and circumstances dictate bringing one aboard the ship. Little do they know that they've invited a highly dangerous extraterrestrial into their midst.<br/><br/>The cast is small but well-assembled. Sigourney Weaver gets most of the attention but there's also excellent work from John Hurt & Ian Holm. In fact, the entire cast is deserving of praise. I can honestly say that there's no weak link in this ensemble cast.<br/><br/>Scott's direction is impressive and often methodical while not allowing the film's pacing to suffer. The cinematography is routinely attractive and really shows off the excellent, Oscar-nominated art direction. The Oscar-winning special effects may be a bit rudimentary by today's standards but they're still convincing for the most part.<br/><br/>Musically, Jerry Goldsmith's score is generally effective but to me there's some material that just seems a bit out of place. This is perhaps unsurprising considering the fact that Goldsmith and the filmmakers didn't exactly see eye to eye. This is only a minor drawback, though.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Alien"" is an important science fiction film whose influence is still being felt today. Even non-science fiction fans should be able to appreciate the movie as a high concept thriller. The sequel (""Aliens"") is also well worth watching, though it should be noted that it's more action-oriented than the first entry in the series."

Suddenly, Kane is almost assaulted by the alien parasite which was an odyssey in itself.<br/><br/>The most famous scene is the most chilling of all. You think Kane is in the clear as he is conversing and eating with his friends until...he vomits, spits, and groans in agonizing pain. The parasite grows and explodes in his stomach!! Now, tell me where the hell can you find an award winning film with this much gore(excluding Saving Private Ryan)? Normally, when things such as said incident happens it's usually in some poorly-directed, cheap, straight-to-DVD droll with a high-kicking pretty boy or some half-wit actress with phony D-cups in the starring role.<br/><br/>Anyway, the next hour or so is a deluge of twists and turns.

Alien is not a dumb-ass, loud, stupid and stereotypical action fair like today: chock-full of CGI, plot holes, and moronic characters that are annoying and useless, and packaged with media hype! No!

","The commercial towing spaceship Nostromo is on a return trip to Earth, after receiving a transmission it picks an Alien that terrorises the crew of seven and they must fight for survival. <br/><br/>Space, spaceships, androids and aliens, and no it's not Starwars or Startrek...<br/><br/>Alien is a perfect blend of characterisation, visual effects, sound and score. What separates this from the two franchises above is the gritty realism, a brooding atmospheric and claustrophobic feel that has given the film both cult and classic status. So much so it spawned its own franchise.<br/><br/>The acting is provided by a perfect heavy-weight cast that includes John Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Tom Skerritt. Dan O'Bannon's screen-play, coupled with Ridley Scott's visuals stop this becoming just another monster alien movie or space film. The subject matter is delivered completely seriously and you become immersed in the dread, fear and uncertainty as even the main characters get killed off (which has become common place these days). Who will be the hero or the heroine?<br/><br/>H.R.Giger creature designs of the face huger and Alien is the ace in the hole and Jerry Goldsmith score mixed with the sound effects gives the film a nightmarish feel that build up the tension to breaking point. Scott's direction is outstanding, creating the most fantastic and memorable moments in film history which push your fear threshold.<br/><br/>Compulsive viewing for Sci-fi fans who want story over action or in this case a steak to digest instead of fast food. <br/><br/>If you've never seen Alien what it treat it will be to watch it fresh."

","Back in 1979, for some strange reason I do not remember, I waited impatiently for weeks (or months?) to finally see Alien. Maybe I got a glimpse of the surreal trailer on TV and was hooked by its impressionistic images and stroboscopic editing. That makes sense, I had plenty of time to watch TV in those days. I was only thirteen at the time and watching plenty of American shows.<br/><br/>I remember finally seeing it at the RIO cinema in my little french- speaking town of Sorel near Montreal during Christmas time '79. That was not a great cinema by today's standard. Bad screen, bad anamorphic lens and bad monophonic sound. But when the dissonant strings of Jerry Goldsmith started after the FOX logo, with the slow appearance of the title, I was hooked. And what I remember in my mind of that first screening is in 70mm with THX sound...<br/><br/>I did not know what to expect at all from that movie. I was of course a sci-fi geek who had seen Star Wars at least five times and Battlestar Galactica a couple of times too. But NOTHING prepared me for what I was about to see.<br/><br/>We were introduced to a sci-fi world but in a way that was almost ""cinéma-vérité"". Unlike most sci-fi films of this time, the story was not written to accommodate big sets and expensive special effects but the other way around. So much details in everything. And all that was casually presented as we were discovering the crew of the Nostromo, waking-up with them in their futuristic environnement but at the same time, feeling at home with them, feeling ourselves part of the crew.<br/><br/>Then, the story shifted to the Alien's planet and it became an odyssey into the unknown. My thirteen year-old mind was petrified from that moment on.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I can say I lost what was remaining of my childhood innocence on LV-426 (The Alien's planet)...<br/><br/>Today, I am waiting for Fox to release the Blu-Ray edition of this movie and I am thinking: NOTHING had ever been presented on a movie screen with such majestic horror.<br/><br/>The biomechanical Gothic design of H.R. Giger for the Alien's environnement and the Alien itself was the biggest contribution of pure art in a movie since ""Un chien Andalou"".<br/><br/>That contribution, along with the visual panache of a young director named Ridley Scott, a flawless Terry Rawling's editing and powerful score by Jerry Goldsmith achieved what could be one of the most complete work of art that Hollywood ever made."

","In one word, dread. Pure, visceral dread. If you are the kind of person who is adverse to feeling uneasy watching horror movies, this is probably your worse nightmare. The 'chest bursting' scene is really not what the movie is all about. It's not about cheap scare tactics and hysterical screaming, but what goes on in the shadows. It taps right into the instinctive fear of the darkness. The tension builds and builds and never lets go until the very end. <br/><br/>This movie as a 'Goldilocks Principle' quality to it, where everything is just right. The characters, the actors, the designs, the score, the atmosphere, the script, the direction,... Snobs may scoff at the simple plot (People in space! scary monster!), but the execution is masterful.<br/><br/>Giger's vision of an alien civilisation is really inspired. The derelict spaceship is a work of art. Its screen time is rather brief, and in a way, it is an inspired move (possibly down to budget constrains!), which removes the banality element of constant exposure (the sequel, Aliens), and leaves a lot to the imagination. Who were these aliens? What are the eggs for? <br/><br/>His creature is downright terrifying, both in looks and purpose. As Ash puts it, ""A survivor unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality"". <br/><br/>There is one weak moment in the entire film, and it is the ending. Like Jaws, for me, it looses its appeal once the beast is revealed and dispatched. And similarly for Alien, the end is a tad disappointing once the creature is exposed in full. And as usual, the hero(ine) wins and the beast is slained. I think a darker ending would have made the movie even stronger. The sequel is a good film, but goes in a totally different direction. Alien stands on its own merits.<br/><br/>Pitch Black had a go at the same premise (stranded handful of characters, monsters emerging from the dark...), but really cannot hold a candle to the original. This will make your blood run cold and you WILL turn on the lights at night!"

","(very small spoiler present - but nothing worth worrying about for prospective first time viewers).<br/><br/>Alien is a film which dictated the true meaning of Science Fiction on Film, paving the way for many films which have followed from the day it was put to tape.<br/><br/>The Sets in the film were, and still are, the BEST sets I have EVER seen in a film. Millions were spent on those sets to give you the feel of the different environments within the Nostromo, Alien Planet, and the Alien Ship. This was done to make SURE that they were all completely unique from each other, futuristic - AS WELL as completely different to anything previously seen. Even without CGI, this film looks futuristic & unsurpassed even by a nowaday definition, if this film were made in the modern day CGI it would no doubt be crap - much like every other film done purely with CGI...all the lighting would no doubt be off, all the shadows, all the thuds of person to set interaction wouldn't play out on camera as well - all of which making THIS film tense & eerie to watch, given the intention.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's influence on the script in the films production is astounding in that regard, with him not only orchestrating the storyboards, but also the construction through to the finished sets to make them the masterpieces that they were. Ridleys used exemplary lighting & camera techniques in order to build tension at the right moments, which made this film the masterpiece that it was to watch...you will usually know when a tense moment is about to happen for example whenever you see strobe lighting in the dark, or hear a heart beating in the background of the soundtrack via Jerry Goldsmith, etc etc...ALL expertly done.<br/><br/>Many people ask me if I thought 'Aliens' was better than the original 'Alien'...and this is my answer:<br/><br/>I DO think the 'Aliens' sequel had a tighter story than the original. The first one seemed to have a 'one track' direction once the crew started getting killed off, whereas the second had more substance with the individual characters in my opinion. Aliens also had the 'ticking clock' factor constantly present - pretty much after the marines get ambushed right at the start, giving the film more pace & direction, and keeping us on the edges of our seats when watching for the first time. There were also more 'jumpy' scenes in the sequel, which in some regards, the first one lacked which allowed attention to drift at points. <br/><br/><ul><li>That said however, it MUST be pointed out that the first film DID pave the way for the second in many ways, the sets as well as the entire look and feel (not to mention the soundtrack) surpassed Aliens without doubt, and without Ridley's camera work in the original - Cameron would of been NOWHERE with his camera work in the second. The same can also be said of the script and screenplay from the original writers, not to mention HR Giger's original artwork!!! without their ideas and groundwork Cameron simply wouldn't of had a hope of making a film which some (not all) consider to be as good as this one. In truth, on all of those merits compared, their about the same...in my opinion however Alien grabs it (JUST) simply because it was done in all with originality, and borrowed NOTHING from ANYONE!</li></ul><br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Alien 9/10 Aliens 8.5/10 (p.s. Alien 3 is barely worth watching, and everything after that is SHITE! thats free advice)"

","In 1979 the movie screen was blazoned with a nightmare unimaginable, a group of space pioneers(truckers some say) are heading home on the Nostromo they are suddenly awakened by the ships computer 'Mother' to investigate an SOS on a nearby alien planet, Executive Officer Kane(John Hurt) Captain Dallas(Tim Skeriritt) and Navigator Lambert(Veronica Cartwritght) all go down to the surface of the planet to investigate, leaving Executive Officer Ripley(Sigourney Weaver), Science Officer Ash(Ian Holm) Chief Engineer Parker(Yaphet Kotto) and Engineering Technician Brett(Harry Dean Stanton) on the ship; whilst on the surface Kane is attacked by an unknown species that attached itself to his face, the Captain and Navigator rush back to get him help letting an unknown and dangerous species on board, soon the Executive Officer is dead and the crew is fighting a frightening enemy which they don't understand.<br/><br/>Now in this classic Science Fiction movie is a lot of great effects, along the caliber of Star Wars which was released two years prior as a matter of fact, Star Wars and Alien are considered to be two of the movies that saved Sci-Fi from being a B movie standard forever. What director Ridley Scott basically did was take the idea of the slasher film put it on space ship and run with it. The deranged killer is an alien that has killed one of the members of the crew to be born, and there are plenty of turns along the way leaving you with the distinct impression of a nightmare, as a matter of fact it has so much Freudian imagery and meaning that it has been dissected by many college students and film critics alike. The writers of this movie started out with a low budget comedy in their college days and morphed it into a serious psychological thriller that will never be duplicated, and to this day still disturbs its fan base with its scenes<br/><br/>There have been discussions and actual quotes that point to this movie being what man would consider rape, it has enough phallic imagery along with enough helplessness to be such a film and it does it in striking way, horrifying, I know this film is nothing for children but if they were every one of the kids who saw it would surely be struck with nightmares.<br/><br/>I'm going to talk here about the director's cut which in truth is a nice addition to the DVD release, and is still a great film but really truthfully offers no addition or subtraction to the overall film, you get some exposition shots where there weren't any and you get to see the ideas behind the alien but in truth there are no additions or subtractions to the overall plot, which Ridley Scott himself said he is pleased with the film in its theatrical release and I applaud him for truly showing us this film integrated with never before seen footage, but still to me it will be the theatrical that I will watch the majority of the time."

It's one of the nastiest things I have seen. The Alien films are horrifying. I don't want to talk about that scene though. I only have a few more things to say about this film. I love this movie and I prefer it over Predator. It's much scarier and cooler than Predator. Really, if I were getting chased by Alien or Predator I'd be scared. But I'd be more scared of the alien.

"elshikh4","8","0","1","19 August 2009"," One of The Best Women, Slasher, Sci-fi Movies Ever !
","This is a milestone before being a masterpiece. A milestone on many levels too.<br/><br/>I think Hollywood was late at making the action hero as heroine. In fact, that didn't happen, internationally, until the late 1960s. Since the start of the 1970s, the things had surely changed. With Swedish movies (Thriller - en grym film -1974), Japanese (Shurayukihime - 1973), or American (Hannie Caulder - 1971), and (Foxy Brown - 1974), it was clear that thereafter the women - European, Asian, American black or white - could be the violent lead, having the ability to retaliate and exterminate.<br/><br/>Look at these 3 movies from (1978), and the roles of their leading ladies: (An Unmarried Woman); a divorced woman who got to be totally on her own. (Coma); a doctor who got to stand up to a corrupted business. And (Halloween) where a young girl, instead of a whole suburban, got to face a mad serial killer. Yes, finally ""she"" got the power to be independent, fight corruption, and kill anyone who wants to kill her. One year later, there was another female lead that got to face insatiable inhuman slasher, all by herself, in never little movie named (Alien) where woman is allowed to kill any ""thing"" that wants to kill her this time.<br/><br/>The tagline: ""In space, no one can hear you scream"" could refer to the scream of the woman in the space of old manly ignoring. But not anymore. The name (Ripley) sounds close to Rebel and Repel. She got the reputation of one of the most memorable, real tough, heroines ever, without being just a scream queen, a man's sexual fantasy, or hating the white community like in the Blaxploitation movies. She looks ordinary but she isn't, using the brain and the brawn in the same time, and assuring eventually that the woman, that kind of woman, could be the only soul survivor in any community, or the one who'd inherit the world!<br/><br/>(Ripley) vanquished 2 aliens already to accomplish that women wouldn't be an alien again in action movies, or in roles that were occupied by only men before. Now ""she"" can win the championships out of the movies, and in it as well. (Sigourney Weaver) isn't that impressively beautiful to tell you the truth, but SHE IS as an actress. She didn't win the Oscar for this role, or even got nominated, but she'll always be my favorite (Ripley).<br/><br/>Now, remember the Horror movies of (1979)? (The Amityville Horror) was the haunted house movie. (When a Stranger Calls), (The Orphan), (Phantasm); I'll save you the trouble; they're all about a monster, innocent people, a hunt. But did they have any meaning other than entertaining you?! I don't think so.<br/><br/>Here, the sense of seriousness, the meditative pace, and the solid sci-fi just own your respect before your attention. I recall (Ian Holm)'s line: ""You still don't know what you're after? Don't you?!""; it's one of few cinematic lines that deeply fascinated me. The whole atmosphere presents cleverly a dark world where the human, even the best of human, don't know everything. These shadows give the story intellectual dimension, to be simply a movie about man and the unknown. This is more profound, more enjoyable, and more immortal than any other work where there is always a masked pervert and a screamer girl. (Alien) fulfilled uniquely being a great, if not the greatest, slasher movie!<br/><br/>It got its own personality to amaze and amuse. Before it, the sci-fi movie was whether totally artistic, or just an empty adventure. This time, it brightly had the best of both. This is rare to happen, and hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Overall, it's anything but usual, cheap, or easy. It's historically important, variously interesting, and - most of all - always enjoyable. Whatever the sequels did; they're not serious, intensive or artistic as the original. And finally, when a perfect genre movie carries a philosophical message; what do we need more?!"

Surely they should have frozen it so that it could be studied when they got back? <br/><br/>ii) Why did the main computer, Mother, have such a terrible interface. The voice interface of HAL 10 years before was so much better. OK, I am being picky here.<br/><br/>iii) How come the company doesn't know about what happened by the time the next film gets underway.

Nostromo is returning to Earth from Thedus but on the way, they pick up what seems to be an S.O.S. They investigate the signal but a creature attaches itself onto one of the crew members face.

The crew members are ordered to capture the alien until they realize that the alien has has grown into the perfect killing machine.<br/><br/>Alien (1979) is a classic horror/thriller film. It is also known as the best science fiction film ever.<br/><br/>Anyway, let's get to the points to Alien. The plot is good and is played out better than the story itself. But the film just isn't scary. In 1979 it may have been scary. But now with all the sequels & crossovers...you just know what the alien looks like. So my advice if you haven't seen the sequels or crossovers then you must watch this first.........unless you get bored easily. Because this movie is extremely slow and takes extreme patience to sit through. Yet i'm not saying that Alien is a bad movie. It is far from being a bad movie.<br/><br/>Let me get you started. The acting. Very realistic and VERY good...this film won Oscars! PS the movie stars SIGOURNEY WEAVER. Her character was likable and very strong throughout the film. Funny too. The FX. One word. Incredible!!! Scary. No. But the Alien is scary & mysterious. Also the movie has it's moments. A lot of 'moments'. Suspenseful isn't the best word to describe this film. Intense it is. Tense scenes abound. Also some people have been bashing this film because it's clichéd & stupid & predictable. Well, the film is heavily clichéd & has it's stupid moments but this IS Alien. One of the movies that started the clichés. Let's move on. The location is outstanding. The atmosphere outstanding. Pretty much the whole movie is outstanding. BTW. Don't get over-hyped. You have got to remember, the movie is a very slow SCIFI flick and was made in 1979. So it involves complicated heavy dialog. Another thing, the movie has a classic-gory scene involving a chest & the alien. Also, the rest of the movie is gory but those scenes go quick so keep your eyes peeled. Kinda violent too.<br/><br/>All in all, an outstanding science fiction/horror CLASSIC.<br/><br/>4 out of five stars.<br/><br/>Followed by a sequel Aliens (1986)."
"l-condley","9","0","1","17 March 2009"," So much more than a horror film.
","Alien is a film that has been summed up in the past as a slasher film in space. This summation does absolutely no justice to the mastery of Ridley Scott's iconic sci-fi. To a certain degree the plot outlines a standard horror set-piece i.e. a motley group of humans find themselves trapped with a nasty beasty intent on gorging itself on them. But there is so much more to admire in all aspects of what is Ridley Scott's finest film (in my humble opinion.)<br/><br/>The opening titles perfectly set the mood of the picture with the atmospheric soundtrack and hieroglyph-like appearance of the word ALIEN. The first half an hour has been criticised as being too slow, but it is absolutely necessary to heighten the suspense and anticipation of what we know is going to happen. This period also serves to establish the underlying sense of dread and isolation that runs through the film. Scott's direction is superb, and the acting of the ensemble is also to be admired (in particular Sigourney Weaver, and a slightly menacing Ian Holm.)<br/><br/>But from the most famous sequence in the film involving John Hurt onwards - the pace never lets up and there are some truly terrifying sequences involving the alien. By the final act the film's intensity goes into overdrive, as the screen becomes a blur of whirring Klaxons, strobe lights and nasty aliens menacing little ginger cats. <br/><br/>The alien design itself is also amazing. Giger's creation is a sleek, balletic, beautiful but deadly beast and is a world away from the snarling, screeching, insectoid xenomorph of later films. It moves with a grace and sinister sensuality. Indeeed there are many sexual and sensual undercurrents to the film, both subtle and overt. This ties in the a great deal of Giger's artwork over his career. <br/><br/>All in all, Alien is without a doubt a masterpiece. Although it belongs in the genres of Science Fiction and Horror, it is an almost perfect execution of both and certainly deserves a mention in the all time greatest films category."
"jerekra","9","0","1","27 February 2009"," In Space No One Can Hear You Scream.
","Alien is the first film in the Alien film franchise. It is a very good film that combines aspects of the science fiction film with the Horror Film. The result is a pretty scary film that also has some interesting science fiction in it as well.<br/><br/>The story is pretty easy to follow for the most part in this film. A giant space ship with a group of seven people receives an SOS signal from a planet so it lands. On the planet one member of the group gets an alien embryo implanted in him that later turns into an alien that starts to cause problems for the members on the ship.<br/><br/>The Alien in this film is a classic. The way it looks with its long head, evil looking mouth with a tongue that can shoot out like a chameleons and also has a separate set of teeth at the end of its tongue is classic. This is the best Alien species in any film in my opinion. The alien gets to do a lot of evil and awesome things in this film. However you do not really get a good view of him. But this works in this film. If you see too much of him then it will not be as scary when it pops out and attacks, which it does a lot in this film. Also he pops out a lot in places where there are distractions that do not allow for a good view of him. This aspect of how the alien is presented makes for a very successful and scary technique that will frighten most audiences. That is why this film is the most scary of all the alien films. In other alien films you know that there are a lot of aliens that are going to come out. In this film there is only one and you never know when he will appear.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is awesome in this film. She really is a great actress and this is the film that propelled her to greatness. SHe always plays a convincing role and this is easily one of her best films. The rest of the cast is OK.<br/><br/>The setting is great. It takes place mainly on the huge freighter ship that has a lot of places where the alien can hide in. This setting also helps to make the film scary. Being on a huge ship that has an evil alien on it in the middle of space is very scary. In space no one can hear you scream either.<br/><br/>This is a great science fiction/horror film that combines elements from each film type to make a great horror film that contains science fiction elements. Recommended strongly."

","Dark, Claustrophobic, chilling, wonderful. A science fiction film so very far ahead of it's time and yet still talked about today, a true classic. There are so many reasons to laud this move, I could easily write a page or three, but I'll be brief. This film contains at least two, possibly three of ""those"" moments - The ""chestburster"" flinging out of John Hurt's (Kane) stomach - absolutely one of the most sickening, gruesome scenes in any film, and at the time completely stunning, a true cinematic moment. The ""facehugger"" jumping out of it's egg (again at poor John Hurt), I challenge you to watch this without an involuntary flinch. Also worth considering is the revelation that Ian Holm (Ash) is an android, sinister (and definitely not ""three laws compliant""). You can watch this again and again and still see more in this superb film, it contains the suspense of Hitchcock, the stark ""look"" of 2001 (perhaps surpassing it) and REAL characters (how's that for a sci-fi flick?). This film stands on it's own merits as a genuine milestone in cinematic history, I kid you not. I would thoroughly advise watching the DVD with the director's comments on audio, Ridley Scott comes across as a humble, yet passionate and warm person dedicated in making a product as enjoyable for himself as well as his audience.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this film, WATCH IT! You won't be disappointed. If you haven't seen this film in a while, go out and rent/buy it, I urge you. I could wax lyrical all day, it's a cracker, pure enjoyment, and that, at the end of the day, is what a movie should be about. They just don't make them like this anymore. <br/><br/>I adore it."

Watching the alien ""dot"" devour the commander ""dot"", while Lambert screamed hysterically into the radio. ""Mother"" about as opposite a real mother as you could imagine: cold, unhelpful.

From the first few minutes of this movie you are hooked. The character development is great, and the story only gets better as the movie goes along. Once the action starts, it never stops. This was one of the most creative films ever made. Very few movies before Alien had the same magic that this movie managed to create (Two that come to mind are King Kong (1933) and the original Star Wars). Even though I knew of the chest burster scene before watching this movie (I saw Alien for the first time last year), it still caught me by surprise. The chest burster looked so much more realistic than the one in Alien vs Predator. The characters emotions during this scene, and the rest of the movie, were very realistic. This is my favorite movie, and I believe that it will never be topped by any movie to come."

","Every time I see this I think of my initial reaction to it at the cinema in 1979. I hadn't seen anything quite like it back then, I dare say that applied to most of the audience too  I thought it a steely cold classic, with a simple plot wrapped around a complicated future. Real computers were thankfully invented afterwards because the use and therefore the inevitable over-use of cgi cartoonery would have ruined the whole point of the film.<br/><br/>Team of space miners get nosey and investigate signals coming from a nearby planet  too late it turns out not to be a distress signal but a stay-away signal. The menacing external and then internal shots of the grounded gargantuan alien spaceship in the storm are still impressive. The result of their nosiness is a ruthless alien lifeform gets on board their spaceship and causes mindless havoc, the implication being of course that they would carry it with them to eventually doom Mankind. The corollary is incomplete as we don't learn whether the aliens are of different politics or religion, although we can see for ourselves that no mercy must be shown to merciless Evil. Will aliens ever be clever enough to swear an oath of allegiance via a universal translator to gain entry before embarking on their savagery? Back to the cinema: the scene where the bloody gibbering penis lookalike dashed out of John Hurt had the audience unintentionally rocking with laughter, however when Dallas confronted the alien in the air vents I jumped a clear foot out of my seat. You feel so daft! But in this dark and cold world everything is so believable and most things beyond criticism or mockery, except maybe as the Rifftrax version I've just watched pointed out, just how many times do you have to save a cat in a picture?<br/><br/>There's plot twists and turns to the very end: it must be one of the best of its kind even with faults caused by technological limitations, simple but unique and worth watching over and over again."
"martijn-56","10","0","1","5 November 2008"," Perfection
","Maybe a 10 is given a bit too much for recently released movies, but this of course is from 1979. For a science fiction horror this is surely a big feat. I give it a 10 since I cannot discover any flaw in it and I also realize to sum up all the good things in it would almost make this and endless story. Even Ridley Scott himself admitted in his 2003 director's cut he changed little since he thought the movie was 'pretty good'. He had always been rather proud of it, he said. Rightly so. What are the elements of a great movie? Story, actors, cinematography (including spec fx), music. They were all perfect. The cast of course, well, no comment necessary. Excellent acting, and also the way they interacted with each other. Ripley really had the chance in this script to show her leading abilities (with irritation of crew members towards her, jealousy?), and earn her credits for being the only survivor of the Nostromo. Also her slowly built up distrust of the scientist is done well. Actually you have to see the movie again, to focus on his behavior's, then you see he is anticipating everything that happens, without much emotion. Story is excellent and simple. It also leaves a lot unanswered, like why the UFO landed there, but with still keeping it credible. Did the UFO find the Aliens on that planet, or did it carry the eggs all the way and crashed there? Well we do not know, since they could also not know it. Excellent foreshadowing when they walk up to the lonely fossilized alien looking at the stars: 'bones are bent outward, like he exploded from the inside. I wonder what happened to the other crew members....' Well, soon we know. The good thing is, you are so involved in the movie and effects, that at least I did not register all this stuff and was surprised as what happened to John Hurt later. Effects are amazing, even today. The view to the stars from the window of the ship while Ripley and the scientist wait for the rest of the crew to come back from the planet, for instance. Beautiful. Or the Nostromo, shot from below. Copied in Independency Day! Ridley Scott really made the setting do something in the story, which is how it should be (as also told in 'How to write a great novel' books by the way). The claustrophobic tunnels, the Art Deco copper designs, the chains, the water dripping, the beautiful alien ship, the smoke all around to hinder visibility (maybe the monster is there!), the sounds of the ship (esp. when it is turned on to automatically explode), the hyper sleep bed,they were all copied in the sequels, for a reason. Last but not least, the alien design. Just how great can it be? A black dragon without real eyes (nor emotion), and a mouth in a mouth. Just brilliant. Not possible to top. It also helps to believe the scientist's admiration for it's purity. After all, it is in it's ugliness also beautiful. Then, the music, great too! Mystical, sometimes creepy, totally fitting and making the atmosphere. For instance the flute sounds when they land on the prime ordeal planet. It all works in this movie.Incedible! And then just how it is shot. So many scenes that are memorable, too many to mention. For instance the slowly standing up of the monster from behind really makes the enormity convincing. Or Ripley in the end alone in the shuttle, with the almost stoned look on her face when she discovers the Alien is still there. That is excellent pulling back, I would say. In stead of being hysterical, she is almost serene, like really living a nightmare. If you can, watch it once with the director comment on, then you see it all, every artistic choice that was made, and had the right effect.<br/><br/>It would not be complete without my idea on Aliens of course. I think, for other reasons, it is right that it also got an 8.5 as this one. Maybe the most important reason for this is, that after a 10 out of 10 movie like Alien, Aliens still was for other reasons equally good. Probably with the Godfather, this is the only one. Aliens was not shot as beautifully as this one, but it has the amazing spectacular special effects, and lots of stuff we had not seen before with of course, the alien queen in it and the girl, that, unlike in most movies, was not annoying but really added to the horror of it. And it had the moving and super spectacular scene in the (almost) end, where Ripley and the girl are on top of the world in fire, with no ship to pick them up, and she tells her to close her eyes. And it had even more slowly built up tension, which is an extraordinary feat, since normally with sequels this does not work (like in Halloween) since we have seen it all in previous movies. <br/><br/>But Alien is my favorite, although I would give Aliens a 9.9 or so."

","I genuinely love this film, but I have always thought that this was the strangest crew structure in the history of sailing vessels.<br/><br/>I count four officers: Dallas, Kane, Ripley, and Ash. Parker and Brett are clearly ""crew"". Lambert is a bit of a mystery. She is a pilot (i.e. more skilled than just a helmsman/helmsperson). In the military, that would make her an officer. On a civilian vessel, who knows? Since she shows no leadership ability whatsoever, I'll count her as crew. That's a 4:3 officers-to-crew ratio. Even if one discounts Ash as having no real supervisory authority, it's at least ten times too high.<br/><br/>Wow! How does the ""Company"" make money? Moreover, there is a lot of living/working space allocated to just seven people. How can one justify a sick bay/science bay that size on the SHUTTLE? And if the shuttle has a sick bay that large, why would it not have facilities to support seven people in an emergency? As they say in Jesus Christ Superstar, ""Only wanna know..."""
"poe426","10","0","1","9 October 2008"," Planet of the Vampires redux...
","PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES may just be Mario Bava's greatest achievement: there is a brooding feel to the proceedings that the cavernous sets only serve to enhance; it's as if the movie were set in a cathedral in space. Gigantic landing gear dwarfs the puny astronauts as they disembark from their ship and the misty, storm-ravaged surface of the planet is about as inhospitable an environment as anything theretofore presented in a science fiction fright film. Tracing the mysterious signal (a warning) to its source, they enter an alien ship through a giant orifice that lends the film a subtle, adult edge not normally found (up to that time) in such films. The fossilized giant was likewise unique for its time. I could go on, but I logged on to comment on ALIEN, the PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES remake (though it was never credited on screen as such). Borrowing also from IT!, THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE, FIEND WITHOUT A FACE and David Cronenberg's THEY CAME FROM WITHIN (a.k.a. SHIVERS), writer Dan O'Bannon and director Ridley Scott remade PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES without the vampires but with a terrifying new creature courtesy of Hans Rudi Giger. The Alien itself stands alongside THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON as one of the greatest costumes ever conceived for a fright film. Atmospheric in the extreme (thanks in no small part to the score), ALIEN is one of those creepy classics that deserves to be revisited from time to time. As is PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES."

","A ship heading home is sent on an SOS to an unidentified planet where the crew discover the planet's mysterious creatures.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's epic Sci-Fi has now become a landmark in the genre with a gruesome and horrific look at outer space and its mysteries.<br/><br/>Scott's direction is exceptional in capturing the right mood for the horrific scenes involving the Alien but more so, the sweeping shots of outer space when the crew lands on the unknown planet. The dark lighting and the chilling fog help create that creepy feeling and when entering new realms of the planet do we see an unknown universe, and plenty of unanswered questions, which is what Alien is all about.<br/><br/>Many scientists, and people in general, have debated whether there are other life forms in space, and Scott's look is a horrific fantasy, a dark and dangerous view of extra terrestrial life, which is brought to vivid life.<br/><br/>For a 70's film, the effects match those of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and are made effect through the chilling atmosphere and the choice of settings which together, make the ultimate fear and unknowing factor, which was vital to the plot.<br/><br/>The slow narrative takes a while to get going but once all the characters are established do we get the true sense of their mission and the situation, and when the Alien is introduced does the plot up the ante and dives into the thriller genre with fast extremely nerve wracking action, and terrifying suspense, and a couple of heart stopping moments.<br/><br/>The ideology of the unknown helps move the narrative along, and we see a look at how people react when choosing professional and personal decisions, which is denoted through some good lead performance.<br/><br/>The plot is strong with the intensity running the show. However there are lapses and the dialogue from the characters isn't always the sharpest.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver stands out as Ripley, the strong female lead of the picture and has created an icon of her character by starring in 3 sequels of the series. Her heroin is a true character, a strong female in the Sci-Fi genre is hard to find whatever year it is, and Ripley is possibly the most recognized female Sci-Fi character of the 70's alongside Princess Leia from Star Wars.<br/><br/>John Hurt cements one of the most gruesome sequences in cinematic history down in a telling and unforgettable manor."

","It is hard to believe this film is nearly thirty years old, despite knowing when all the shocks are coming it is still frightening.<br/><br/>As I suspect most readers will know the plot follows the crew of the Nostromo, a long range space tug. At the start of the film they are awakened from hyper-sleep and are surprised that they aren't back at Earth as planned but in a strange system where they have intercepted a possible distress beacon's message. When they investigate they find a strange alien ship that appears to have been there a very long time, the pilot has fused to his chair and his ribs are broken in a way that suggests he was killed from the inside.<br/><br/>As they continue to explore the ship Kane (John Hurt) discovers a room full of strange leathery pods, when he touches one it opens and a strange creature jumps out, burns its way through his helmet and clamps itself onto his face. Back on the shuttle they attempt cut it off only to discover that the creature bleeds an acid so strong that a few drops burn through several of the ship's decks. After a while the creature detaches itself and dies for no apparent reason. When Kane awakes he is very hungry and wants a good meal before they go back in to hyper-sleep for the return home. During this meal the alien makes its dramatic appearance as it bursts out of Kane's stomach to the shock of his colleagues. The rest of the film follows their attempts to kill the alien which for some reason one of the crew appears to be protecting.<br/><br/>Unlike most other science fiction films of its time Alien doesn't feature a spaceship with gleaming white surfaces instead it is a dirty claustrophobic vessel which is clearly a work horse and far from new, another difference with other such films is that the hero of the story is actually a heroine in the form of Ellen Ripley played by the excellent Sigourney Weaver in her first major role. The rest of the cast are also great as is the design of the alien, by only showing bits of it at a time it never looks like a man in a suits so remains terrifying till the end.<br/><br/>If you've yet to see this film and like horror or sci-fi I strongly recommend that you give it a go."

","Most people didn't get the point of that film. When I talked to some of my friends (one of them movie goer), they found that film rather boring. Why? Good question. They said (most of them), that movie didn't consist of any unexpected loud noises, bunch of aliens popping out from the corridor, but what took me aback the most, was one of them saying (it was the movie goer) that blurring screen near the end of the film was completely unnecessary and he didn't know what was the point of it...Yes, yes. Nowadays people expect not a real horror movie (alien, psycho, exorcist, the thing), but some shitty picture depicting lot of blood, violence, and tons of cadavers being slain like flies. For me, it was the PERFECT horror movie. Everything in it was tied in well, everything was real (theoreticaly it could happen), and the anxiety was continuously bottling up from the very beginning (that I found the best). Plus the awesome music, special effects (1979!!!), and one, however great, twist. All that gives you the film that will occupy your mind for a lot more you'd expect."

","Scott's vision of hostile aliens paved the way for many lesser directors to portray hostile alien lifeforms but barring a few none have been able to create the same amount of horror as Alien did.<br/><br/>A strange signal on an off-world leads the humans straight into the path of a species which is parasitic in nature and evolved to the extent of being the perfect killing machines.<br/><br/>The movie might be science fiction on the outset but plays out like a edge-of-the-seat horror. Thankfully the lack of CGI forces the special effects crew and Scott to exploit lighting, sound and clever editing to the full extent.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Alien franchisee has been murdered by the studio and is now a joke. Its foolish to wait for the studio to ever redeem themselves, so horror fans, accept that 1979 was as good as it gets and watch the reruns as often as possible."

","*** A TINY SPOILER IN HERE, BUT ONLY IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THE ORIGINAL VERSION, LET ALONE THE ""DIRECTOR'S CUT"" *** In 1979 I was 22 years old.<br/><br/>For months prior to its opening I watched the TV ads for ""Alien"" in fascination. I thought, ""WOW, this looks TRULY scary!"" NEAT! <br/><br/>Back then they didn't have presale tickets available except at the box office itself. As I lived in a pretty far away 'burb of Hollywood at the time I didn't get a chance to get my ticket until long after ALL of the other showings EXCEPT ONE had sold out on opening weekend at the BEST theater in which it was playing in town, the Egyptian, in Hollywood. (Long before its conversion into the American Cinematheque). Due to studio-predicted demand, on opening weekend ""Alien"" played at the Egyptian from around 6 am Friday morning all the way thru the weekend CONTINUOUSLY! All day, all night showings, on the biggest screen there.<br/><br/>So when did I go? The Saturday 3 am showing! BY MYSELF! Afterwards I walk out, and a cop immediately happens upon me. There I am, 6 am on Hollywood Blvd, just standing in shock outside the theater entrance. He asked ""Are you OK? You look ill!"" I said ""Yeah!"", went to my car, looked for ""eggs"" in the backseat, drove home, and had nightmares that night. (You might say I was impressionable even at that age in those days! LOL) True story.<br/><br/>OK, so now I'm long over the shock of ""Alien"". And tonight the AFI showed ""Alien"" at a great theater near where I live, the ArcLight in Sherman Oaks. Yup, I'm still in a 'burb of, albeit closer to, Hollywood. It played on one of the two biggest screens in the complex. And I went.<br/><br/>It was glorious to see it again on a big screen, first time since that opening weekend! Altho the additions to this, the ""director's cut"", were interesting, I think I prefer the version I saw way back then (and later, repeatedly on the tiny TV screen when they showed it on HBO, etc, over the years). Much more ""clostrophobic"" in feeling. But it still does a fantastic job to awe and frighten. Standouts (outside of the story, script and direction) are the fantastic lighting, beautiful soundtrack (especially all the noises), great acting by newbies at the time, and more.<br/><br/>So if you ever get a chance to see ""Alien"" on the big screen, DO, no matter how many times you may have seen it at home.<br/><br/>And what's there next week? ""Aliens"". I saw that film opening weekend too, again at the Egyptian! (I feel like one lucky boy!)"

","This movie holds a special place in my heart. It was my favorite movie when I was a kid and I continue to hold it in very high esteem. I don't know what it was about it that intrigued me so much when I was young. It was probably a combination of the stark photography, the deliberate pacing, the creepiness and mystery of the set pieces, the unique futuristic grittiness (""The used future"", as George Lucas went on to call it) of the production design, the now-clichéd ""Ten Little Indians"" storyline, the naturalistic and unpretentious performances, Jerry Goldsmith's effective score, the then-original combination of science fiction and horror, the lack of dependence on subplots and dialogue to carry the film and how the characters and the film remained interesting without it, and most importantly, how something that can seem cool for a kid (I.e. outer space) can suddenly become the most terrifying thing ever. Ridley Scott knew how to psychologically terrify his audience with this setting and I couldn't get enough of it.<br/><br/>Also, this is one of the first R-rated movies that I saw. But I wasn't traumatized but exhilarated and appropriately scared. It triggered the kind of fear that helps you get in touch with something primal. That is I love these movies, especially this one.<br/><br/>What is also incredible is that this film is imitated endlessly both in space and on earth. The more of them I see the more I see how unique, groundbreaking, and spellbinding this film truly is. I am truly thankful that I had this film to educate me on how movies should be made and how they should always allow a psychological element for the audience once in a while especially in these kinds of thrillers. A true masterpiece."

They also learn there's someone on the ship who knew what was going on.<br/><br/>""Alien"" is one of the best horror/sci-fi movies ever. It gave us the heroine Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and an extremely disgusting and frightening alien (up until the time of the ""Alien vs. Predator"" movies, the alien was actually considered a horror icon...now, because of those films, it's more downgraded).<br/><br/>A pure horror classic, delivered with impeccable acting and precision, ""Alien"" is a movie that shouldn't be missed!"

Watching this again I was much less scared, but the pure unmitigated fear that is transmitted into your mind by some of the scenes took me back to my youth and I felt those stirrings in my memories, the reminders of that long ago fear being resurrected.<br/><br/>The thing that is required to make this movie work is imagination. We rarely see the alien so there is very little there to be scared of visually. The thought of the creature is what really scares the viewer. So if you are the type that is very literal and up front, this movie will do nothing for you. If you are the type that is more imaginative and perhaps a little paranoid, this movie will scare the hell out of you."

","The commercial mining ship and refining ship the Nostromo is returning to home through the outer rim. The ship's crew of seven are in hyper-sleep, only called to action in the most dire emergency, with the ship running on automatic, the corridors empty, the bridge lifeless. Until an alien SOS is broadcast and the crew's blissful slumber is broken so that they can help. The crew clearly don't like each other and this is not a Star Trek style Utopian existence, they are co-workers cast together, they do the job and live to together in a clutch of uneasy alliances.<br/><br/>As they realise they are not near home and have been awoken for another reason, they are, by the nature of their contracts, required to investigate. A three man team is assembled but as time goes on and more of the alien message is deciphered it appears that it is not an SOS but a warning, and from this point on claustrophobic movies will never be the same again.<br/><br/>Alien is one of the greatest horror films of all time, preying on all of our most primeval fears, fear of the unknown, fear of being eaten and fear of something inside destroying us, all of these fears are on show here with perhaps the most prevalent being the fear of the dark which this film does supremely well, without it being so dark that you can't see what is happening (A la ""Alen 3). The script builds up slowly but purposely allowing the feeling of unease to grow inside us but without being boring or tiresome. The performances are all top notch with all the leads doing their jobs to perfection, with everyone playing their parts like it's a kitchen sink drama which again, makes the horror that much more terrifying as the ordinariness of the performances leads to terror that we can relate to perfectly.<br/><br/>I can't remember much about the score but it does not detract nor take anything away from the film so I guess it must be good. The direction is Ridley Scott's best ...Yes, better than ""Blade Runner"" and better than ""Gladiator"". However, although this film is Ridley's best work, it hasn't lead to a career of mediocrity, rather a career that has lead to quality, consistency and continued invention.<br/><br/>Aliens is okay and three and four aren't worth looking at, but thirty years later this is still a chilling and inventive horror that is as unsettling to watch as it is enjoyable.<br/><br/>PS Final thought. Sigourney's dressing in the space suit is still one of the sexiest scene's in cinema history, and I still don't know why?"
"brando647","10","0","1","6 July 2008"," A Science-Fiction/Horror Masterpiece
","Ridley Scott's science-fiction/horror masterpiece is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. Why can't they make sci-fi/horror movies like this anymore?! A strong story, a claustrophobic atmosphere, a superb cast, and one of the coolest creature creations to come out of Hollywood. It's tough to find someone who hasn't already seen this film and it's harder to find someone who didn't enjoy it. The story revolves around the 7-person crew of the NOSTROMO, a commercial space vessel towing a refinery back to Earth. Halfway home, their journey is interrupted when they receive a possible distress call of unknown origin from a nearby planetoid. A quick investigation leads to some of the most memorable movie moments when their ship is soon terrified by a seemingly unstoppable alien.<br/><br/>I first saw this movie on cable when I was around 11-12 years old and I remember the scene with Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) scouring the lower decks in search of Jones (the cat) when he first encounters the full-grown xenomorph alien; that one scene scared the crap out of me and it officially hooked me for life. The entire movie has a cramped feel with set design that gives you the feeling that the creature could pop out from any bulkhead at any moment. Honestly, the set design is probably one of my favorite aspects of this film. Unlike some science fiction films where everything is clean, shiny, stream-lined, etc, Scott's film has a realistic, gritty, lived-in feeling that makes the movie feel more grounded in reality (which makes the danger feel that much more ominous). And you can't mention the design of this film without mentioning the contributions of H. R. Giger; the man is a surrealist genius and this movie would NOT have been the same without his cooperation.<br/><br/>The cast of this film did a fantastic job at bringing this film to life. The chemistry between the 7 crew members feels genuine and it's definitely easy to believe these people have been stuck on a spacecraft for years with each other. John Hurt, as the doomed Kane, was great and I can't imagine how different things would've been if the part had gone to Jon Finch as was originally set. Tom Skerritt and Veronica Cartwright both contributed strong performances while the chemistry between Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton made for some great moments. My absolute favorite characters in this film were Ash (played by the ever-awesome Ian Holm) and, of course, the iconic Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). From the very beginning, you can tell there's more to Ash that what he lets on and Holm does a great job of giving those subtle hints to keep you suspicious of his intent. And Sigourney, well, she just rocks. Ripley has become a film icon as a head-strong, capable, female lead and Weaver was the perfect woman for the role. The animosity between Ripley and Kotto's chief engineer Parker made for some tense moments and she even managed to carry the movie on her own towards the end.<br/><br/>And finally, the Alien itself. It is one of the coolest creature designs for a movie ever, courtesy of H. R. Giger. It's sleek, slimy, look with it's trademark extendable inner mouth have made this one of the most memorable monsters to grace the big screen and spawned three direct sequels. Upon watching this movie, it's easy to see what's placed it on the top favored movies of so many people..."

","When I watch Alien, believe it or not, I'm not that interested in the creature itself. It's all the other details that usually catch my attention and make me admire the film every time I watch it.<br/><br/>To start, the breathtaking cinematography. From the outer space shots of the Nostromo to the inside of the ship, this film is beautifully shot and makes the visual style a character too.<br/><br/>Then, the characters. An amazing ensemble of believable people, even for a sci-fi movie. The interaction, dialogue and overall personalities of the Nostromo crew is probably what I like the most about Alien.<br/><br/>The cast did a great job of portraying these characters. Characters that I find likable, interesting and entertaining. Kane (John Hurt) is my favorite character, despite having the shortest screen time.<br/><br/>The story is, well, fantastic. Suspense and horror at its best. Subtle and well-crafted horror that modern-day viewers might disregard as ""not scary"" or ""the alien looks fake"".<br/><br/>The movie is a bit slow-paced but that's just part of the charm, methinks. I saw the slightly faster-paced extended cut and I gotta say I prefer the slower-paced original. That is what makes the suspense work. It's not about showing the monster do something scary right away, it's about building expectative, something that most modern suspense/horror movies have forgotten.<br/><br/>Which leads me to the title character. I couldn't have seen the film back in 1979 and I'm sure the audiences found the alien scarier then, however, I still find it pretty scary. Not just scary-looking (which he is, as well as cool-looking) but scary within the context of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a masterpiece. A film that will always keep me entertained as well as amazed by how incredibly detailed and brilliantly directed it is."

The Terror from Beyond Space, this instant classic set a tone of its own, offering richly detailed sets, ominous atmosphere, relentless suspense, and a flawless ensemble cast as the crew of the space freighter Nostromo, who fall prey to a vicious creature (designed by Swiss artist H.R. Giger) that had gestated inside one of the ill-fated crew members. In a star-making role, Sigourney Weaver excels as sole survivor Ripley, becoming the screen's most popular heroine in a lucrative movie franchise. To measure the film's success, one need only recall the many images that have been burned into our collective psyche, including the ""facehugger,"" the ""chestburster,"" and Ripley's climactic encounter with the full-grown monster. Impeccably directed by Ridley Scott, Alien is one of the cinema's most unforgettable nightmares."

"tellusallaboutit","10","0","1","15 May 2008"," some observations of this and subsequent movies
","Alien is a masterpiece, and the alien mythology is one of the most interesting in sci-fi. Aliens is equally good for different reasons. Alien 3 diverges from a strong storyline but is pretty good, and Alien: Resurrection is a disaster.<br/><br/>In alien we meet Ripley. She's an unlikely heroin to start out with, and nobody expects her to survive. She is scared throughout the film and survival and the destruction of the alien is her primary motivation.<br/><br/>'Aliens' starts with her character being the same as in 'Alien', but she's angry at being disavowed by the company and haunted by memories of the events in Alien. We see her transform from a haunted and angry woman to a badass by circumstance and the maternal instincts she develops after meeting Newt. The juxtaposition between her and the mother alien is nothing short of brilliant, and it takes the series, alien mythology and Ripley's character to a whole new level. There are very few ways to turn someone like the Ripley from 'Alien' into the Ripley from the end of 'Aliens', and the fact that they were able to pull it off and make it believable is awesome.<br/><br/>Alien 3 sees her character beat down, sick, and grief-stricken. She must use her wits to defeat the alien, as weapons are unavailable. Still, she is motivated in a different way, and although it isn't a direct continuation of the original 'Alien' storyline as 'Aliens' was, it is an interesting 'what if' film.<br/><br/>In 'Alien: Resurrection Ripley' is not scared and her maternal instincts have shifted largely to the Aliens. She is split between the human and alien camps, and because of this her motivations and the reason for her actions are unclear and her character is difficult to identify with. A weak plot line makes this movie forgettable. Hopefully, someday someone will make a movie that starts where 'Aliens' left off.<br/><br/>I always thought that a good reason for the different looking aliens in this movie versus ""aliens"" and the other films would be that not only do they adopt the traits of their hosts during development, they can also sense their situation and adapt to that (this would also explain a longer gestation period). For example, the alien in 'Alien' can sense that there is no queen or other aliens around and that causes it to develop into a 'rogue' alien - a bit more cunning and capable than the 'worker' aliens from 'aliens'. This alien's motivation would be to get things ready for when the queen showed up. <br/><br/>The 'dog' alien from alien 3 would be similar, but it also would like to chow down on its victims a bit more - that is, if aliens need to eat at all - which is still unclear. You never see the alien from the first movie eating anything really, just killing or abducting. In the directors cut there's a half-baked scene with dallas all bound up in goo, but that was taken out of the original version - which is a good thing because it convolutes the storyline.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, instead of unifying the existing parts of the alien storyline that were laid out in alien and aliens, with every new movie the producers, writers, and directors throw in new pointless wildcards that confuse the storyline."

","I only watched it for the first time a couple of weeks ago. To be honest I didn't know what to expect since I had heard some pretty mixed reviews. I not only loved Alien but it would also take up quite a high spot on my top 100 movies list. It was chilling, well written and masterfully directed by Ridley Scott. There are several scenes that still send a shiver down my spine no matter how many times I watch it, for instance the scene in which the alien comes out of John Hurt. Sigourney Weaver never looked sexier. Since then I have made it my mission to view Ridley Scott's other work which I hadn't seen before. I thought Blade Runner was rather boring but I absolutely loved American Gangster. Viewing most of his movies made me realise that Alien is his finest work. Aliens wasreally good but not a patch on the original. Along with Halloween Alien is my favourite horror movie. An unmissable horror flick."
"RichardKleiner","10","0","1","23 April 2008"," An intelligent, properly constructed horror film that is GREAT!
","I finally got to watch Alien on a special edition DVD. And, as many have said before, it is great.<br/><br/>A freighter space ship called ""Nostromo"" is on its way back home carrying an entire ore processing mine, when Mother (the ship's main computer and automatic pilot) stops prematurely. A transmission coming from an alien planet (or moon, that is) is detected by the ship and, as Company's regulations indicate, the crew is forced to investigate and, if the transmission proved to come from an intelligent alien life form, retrieve a sample of the life form to be analyzed on Earth.<br/><br/>I won't tell the rest of the plot, to avoid potential spoilers, and also because there is no reason to further explain it. The plot is actually very simple, still, the film's remarkable screenplay manages to calmly present the situation and accumulate the tension and suspense.<br/><br/>The dialogs are probably the most realistic I have ever heard. Nowadays, those terrible ""horror"" movies have the worst clichés and lines ever. Instead, in Alien, most of the scientific mumbo jumbo is actually the real thing, and not only that, the performances and settings make the scenes greatly believable.<br/><br/>This movie set the rules to be followed in all horror movies. Everybody except whoever has top billing in the credits dies. Still, while in all of those mediocre cheap scare films where the big CGI monster doesn't even scare you, we don't feel absolutely anything for any of the victims. However, in Alien you see what a space ship crew would actually do in a situation like that and you do give a crap about them.<br/><br/>Although the effects for the Alien look kind of out fashioned, it's shown in a very original way, not showing way too much. You always loose a lot when you show the monster at the beginning. However, even as you can see it's a guy in a suit, the way you see it always makes you jump and scream.<br/><br/>The music was interesting. This is an understatement, considering it was composed by the master Jerry Goldsmith. Still, the suspense and thrilling cues are excellent, as for the music for the grand showdown. The overture was also very good.<br/><br/>The iconic scene with the chest-burster is the most realistic gore sequence I have ever seen. Perhaps the baby Alien running away seems more like a little doll, but it still gives you the creeps.<br/><br/>With it's brilliant direction, it's amazingly genius script, it's effects (they seem a little out-dated, but you almost can't tell that), the excellent production designs, the cinematography and lighting, the performances, every single thing. This is a real horror/suspense film with a sci-fi setting, but it's miles away from other inferior ""horror"" flicks.<br/><br/>Now, I have to compare it with Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (it's almost blasphemy). They both share dark lighting, However, while in Alien the lighting is used for creating better suspense and much greater scares whenever he appears, in AvP:R the major hook for the films is watching the aliens fight each other, and with the terrible dark sets, you don't see a thing. Also, while the characters in Alien are believable and very well represented, the ones in AvP:R are way too generic and/or clichéd.<br/><br/>Congratulations, Mr. Scott. This is one of the best sci-fi films ever, best horror films ever, best suspense films ever and overall best films ever."

","This is really one of the best horror movies ever. Yes, it's a horror movie not a sci-fi flick. The direction is great as is the script. I love the dialog in this movie. The actors really did an excellent job, especially Weaver. Now I don't want to get on a rant here, but there is something that needs to be addressed. Rather than tell you how great the movie is or go through this film scene by scene, there is something I need to make clear. I have read a lot of reviews and I kept reading the same thing. ""In this movie Sigourney kicks some alien butt."" (Believe me I'd rather use the ""A"" word, but I'm afraid to get black listed.) Sigourney Weaver doesn't really kick alien butt until ""Aliens"" in 1986. Thats when see becomes the badas... er, badbutt alien destroyer. However, in the first ""Alien"" she's just a space trucker who's trying to get home to her daughter. She doesn't really become the hero we all know and love until later. However she does start to evolve into the hero in this one. She quickly stepping up to leadership when Dallas dies. I must admit I'm slightly sexist when it comes to a female hero. To me it's just not that believable, but in Sigourney's case she really pulls it off. I'm not going to lie, if I got chased by aliens and I had to either have Ellen Ripley or Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger from ""Predator"") on my side, I'd choose Ripley. Sorry, I ranted. Anyways this is the best movie in the ""Alien"" series, the ""Predator"" movies, and the cross-over movies. Normally, I'd say I recommend this if your a fan of so-and-so or I you like so-and-so kinds of movies, but no. I recommend this movie to everyone. This is one of those movies you should have already seen."

","Alien is perfect from start to finish. The opening title sequence is one of the creepiest and effective in modern cinema. Jerry Goldsmith's music score is chillingly vibrant throughout the film's duration.<br/><br/>The cast are perfectly suited to their roles. Sigourney Weaver excels as Flight officer Ripley, showing the character to be tough and by the book. (Like telling her captain 24 hours for quarantine). Its easy to see why this film made her a star. The atmosphere, set design and special effects were so new when this film was released in 1979, that audiences worldwide were seeing something that they had never saw before (just like George Luca's earlier Star Wars)in fact when i saw the film on its 'Director's cut' cinema release in November 2003, i was in awe of the fact that the film has not dated at all...it is utterly timeless, and will probably stand the test of time for years to come.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to Ian Holm as the science officer Ash. His portrayal of this character is perfect. I won't spoil it for you dear readers who have not seen this classic, but Holm is a revelation here (as is his character) and you will remember his part in this film (as well as the infamous dinner table sequence). Alien is the best science fiction horror film ever. It has not been bettered and its been ripped off countless times: Deepstar Six, Leviathan, Event Horizon and Sunshine come to mind.

","Alien (1979, Dir.

When a alien life-form attach's itself to the face of crew member, Kane, the rest of the team act fast to try and separate the two organisms. Unbeknownst to everyone, this is the start of the terror which would affect every member of the seven person crew.<br/><br/>After watching 'Alien' it's not hard to see that nearly 30 years later, it still has the ability to scare you. The story is simple and has been used in countless films since the introduction of 'Alien', but this is not what makes it great. Firstly, there's a small number of characters featured within this film. The are seven human characters in the film. Whilst this might seem like a small number, it does actually give a chance to add a lot of character to each individual, and add to the fright factor. Too many characters give the alien a disadvantage. The special effects are basic and so convincing, with only slight appearances of the alien to tease everyone. Do to being a fan of movies, i have large knowledge of what happens behind the scenes. The disadvantage of this, is that i rarely get spooked by movies anymore, but this was an exception. I literally jumped when the alien appeared in the dark. If you want a go at a classic fright fest, then choose this.<br/><br/>""We have Parker. Can Brett be far behind?"" - Kane (John Hurt)"

","Alien is a good film with a number of major flaws, some of which should never have been allowed into the final released print. I saw it in the cinema on its original release, and was throughly looking forward to it being both a sci-fi and horror fan.<br/><br/>1. So I was bemused to spend the first 5 minutes wandering over every square inch of the Nostromo. It was almost as if I was being told ""We've spent 5 million bucks on these sets, and you're going to see every square inch before we even start the film."" <br/><br/>2. An hour of inconsequential fluff before anything happened. An hour!! <br/><br/>3. Face hugger - good, from the alien spaceship to its final demise in the sickbay. This was more like it.<br/><br/>4. Chestburster - absolutely horrific. Until that is, it looked round like a curious cartoon mole popping up out of a mole-hole, and skittered off to hide and grow. Everyone in the cinema laughed. Everyone. The entire impact of the chest bursting - thrown away. I can't believe that they wouldn't have been aware of this before putting the film into release.<br/><br/>5. Rewiring Ash. Sigourney Weaver is wiring up a dummy head prior to Ian Holm's head, protruding through a false floor, answering her questions. So how do they bridge the transition from false head to real head? By using a cutaway to Ripley concentrating on the task in hand. No, they don't bridge it at all - instead, there is the most jarring jump-cut in the history of cinema. Even people who aren't versed in the grammar of cinema know that something cronky has happened, even if they can't put their fingers on what it is. This is Basic Film-making, first term, first lesson. Just plain awful.<br/><br/>6. From here to the end, apart from the illogicalities and unanswered questions, the rest of the film is pretty good.<br/><br/>Is that enough to make up for those glaring glitches? Not in my book."

I would have liked more of a tour of the alien spaceship, but the scenes we saw were quite impressive.<br/><br/>Still, it is a sci-fi horror flick.

","There are not so many movies, which I'm craving to have in my DVD collection, but ""Alien"" is definitely one of them. It is grim and tough, it is dark and surreal, it is violent and freaky, it is thought-provoking and mesmerizing. You can try to make fun of it, but you cannot hurt its reputation of a solid sci-fi, because there are so few movies of this calibre. Like in case with ""Terminator"" I do not like the following ""part"": ""Aliens"" and ""Terminator 2"" turned the initial concepts into ""shoot-'em-all"" parody.<br/><br/>Atmosphere of loneliness and constant danger is created and being kept up all through the movie. One wrong actor could have ruined it all but the director made the right choice. Every actor is in its place and performs very well.<br/><br/>I agree with those IMDb reviewers who mention that ""Aliens"" destroyed the original concept. Damn right. ""Alien"", as I see it, was never about a war of marines vs. hordes of ETs. ""Alien"" was about our fears and loneliness, about such moments in our life when no living man, even with a big plasma rifle or whatever, can help you, and you have to fight for yourself.<br/><br/>I'm very grateful to our DVD market that it lets us buy ""Alien"" movies separately. I would never buy the ""Alien quadrology"", because the quality of all the parts is extremely different.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 - triumph of sci-fi genre. Thank you for attention."

","So much has been written on this film already that I won't go over the plot synopsis or the special effects, other than to say they stand amazingly well on their own, even today. Nothing about this film, not even the hair styles, feels datedcertainly not to the era of Bee Gees and polyester leisure suits of the time period when this was filmed. The effects are top notch, the ships, machinery, and of course, H.R. Geiger's creature are as believable today as ever. Like the Van Morrison song Brown Eyed Girl, if it came out today, Alien would be a #1 hit.<br/><br/>Much of Alien's greatness lies in how much it leaves to your imagination. Other than the chest bursting scene and Parker's very briefly shown impalement, the viewer is treated to no actual shots of human bodies being abused.its all left to your imagination. Which is running wildly as little bits and pieces of the creature's terrifying physical characteristics are revealed. In retrospect, I prefer the original cut of the movie to the directors cut where Ripley finds the cocooned Dallas near the end, as it takes away the suspense from the captain's original disappearance. It's a testament to Ridley Scott's brilliance that he left it out of the original film, and instead let the viewer decide what other appendages the alien had in store for him. We found this. No blood. No Dallas. Nothing.<br/><br/>The other great part of this film's atmosphere for me is the improv. style of many of the conversations. A lot of the scenes sound like they were filmed without wireless and boom mikes, and the effect is totally convincing. Characters mumble, they talk over each other, and they carry on conversations that don't feel scripted at all. The meals in the mess hall, Kane's coming out of the coma, and Dallas descending into hell are scenes that are particularly noteworthy. Alien doesn't feel like a conventional movie at allit swings between these Discovery Channel documentary like scenes, to Ripley's desperate, nightmarish last dash for the lifeboat at the end. Klaxon's blaring, steam venting and strobe like warning lights just meld together to create the perfect atmosphere of primal survival and mind numbing horror that makes you feel like you are running through the ship with her. The finis is just as brilliant as the rest of the film. It sucks you into a sense of false security with a few brief moments to enjoy the amazingly beautiful 20 year old and disrobed Sigourney Weaver. But this is no ordinary cheese cake shoot.by the time all hell has started breaking loose, you're so terrified and rooting for Ripley that you've almost forgotten those bikini panties. At least temporarily.<br/><br/>Its difficult to understate how shocking and effective this movie was at the time it came out. Nothing like it had ever been seen before. Alien is like an orgasm.its effect on your psyche and the high you get is difficult to describe the first time you experience it, but it just gets better and better the more you indulge in it, and the more practiced you become in appreciating it's nuances. Even though it has no equal to this day, our collective exposure to other original and disturbing horror films like Hellraiser and Seven will dull the experience somewhat if you are seeing it for the first time. Which, by the way, if you are, I'd recommend locating the biggest screen you can, and surround sound if possible. Every fan of this movie should also get a hold of a copy of H.R. Geiger's Necronomicron books of artwork for some truly disturbing images that inspired the movie."

After a bad landing on the planet, some crew members leave the ship to explore the area. At the same time as they discover a hive colony of some unknown creature, the ship's computer deciphers the message to be a warning, not a call for help. When one of the eggs is disturbed, the crew do not know the danger they are in until it is too late.<br/><br/>So, like every classic, I always watch them so late so there's no surprise here. I was really looking forward to the film, since it was being called a horror or sci-fi classic from people to people. But the problem with that is that the ending and some memorable scenes tend to go out in public for people who haven't seen the movie, like me.<br/><br/>So the first 20 minutes passed. Nothing special there. I honestly thought the action would start right away because I've seen AVP before this movie so I expected things people wouldn't expect because the film was made 1979 and I've seen it in 2007. I knew the ending and I kinda knew a bit of the middle so that probably lowered my rating for this movie.<br/><br/>One other reason why I might not give this movie a perfect rating is the clichés. Of course, if I've seen this movie in 1979, it wouldn't be called clichés but to let you know, so many movies pulled off the same clichés so I can't help myself but roll my eyes when characters do stupid things to get themselves killed.<br/><br/>On a better note, I love this movie for its intensity, thrills, and suspense. Actually, there is one pop up scene, probably the only pop up scene, that made me yell out loud. That's how suspenseful the movie is. The death scenes are well made since you wouldn't know how they would die (but you would certainly know who would die).<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver's performance as the heroine was, I suppose, heroing and tough. The special effects were decent, as for the Alien design. I have to admit, though, the last 15 minutes of the movie was annoying because of the light flashing constantly on the screen, to heighten tension, of course.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say this is the greatest movie ever. If I'd seen this in 1979, my opinion might be different, but no, this is 2007. I would say this film is a great sci-fi thriller which keeps the suspense and tension throughout.

We see reflections of the data from the visors of the helmets, when the automated procedures wake up the the crew of seven.<br/><br/>The opening scene has burned itself into my mind. It has been there since I saw the film for the first time as a kid aged of six or so. From some reason I thought that scene was a bit scary back then. Even though I don't think the opening as scary anymore, I still do think it's a great way to open a story.<br/><br/>Ridcley Scott manages to serve a visually and stylistically stunning movie, the best movie of the Alien franchise. From the design of Nostromo to the derelict ship of the space jockeys, we see solid design all around. H.R. Gigers alien design is, well from the lack of a better word, so alien, yet so familiar, that it stays to haunt you in the back of your mind. A hunter, whose only priority is to survive and ensure the survival of the species.<br/><br/>It's very difficult to try and pin point a weak link from the film. There may be one or two inconstancy's in the story and a couple of special effects may look like they were done in the late 70's, but the thing is, that the film and the effects have taken the test of time very well. This is a movie with deep shadows and alien sounds. This is a story, that dives deeper inside your psyche than you even realize. And it gets better each time you watch it."

","One of the first offerings from master of atmosphere Ridley Scott, Alien takes place aboard a cramped, claustrophobic starship, the Nostromo, as she heads back to Earth from a mining mission in the outer rim. Unfortunately, the crew are awoken early by a distress call from a small, seemingly uninhabited planet. A cold, wind-swept little rock in the middle of nowhere. They set down on LV-426, and a team makes their way across the barren planet to the scene of an old starship-wreck. They go inside the alien craft, and Kane (John Hurt) is molested by a parasitic organism that attaches itself to his face. Rushed back to the Nostromo, Kane is put in stasis with the organism attached to his face, keeping him alive for reasons unknown. Later, as the crew is sailing, back on course through dark space, about to re-enter hypersleep, Kane takes ill...and dies...but not before a larval alien 'thing' bursts from his chest in a shower of blood and intestine...before disappearing into an air duct and skittering away...<br/><br/>And so begins the nightmare on the Nostromo...as the crew race to find the being, who quickly sheds layers of skin and grows...and grows...til it looms massive, taller than Brett, the unfortunate first member of the crew to run into the Alien. From here to the end of the film is a desperate race against time and against a cold, unfeeling, brutal, seemingly indestructible killing machine whose ""technical perfection is matched only by it's hostility..."" and the tension does not let up until the very last frames...when you actually release the breath you've been holding for 40 minutes...<br/><br/>This premise, so original 2 years after Star Wars rocked the sci-fi world, has been ripped off by so many films now that anyone under the age of 25 who sees this now thinks ""it's all been done before..."" What a shame! Coz this film started it all. Take a bunch of likable, ""normal"" people we can all relate to, put them in a claustrophobic, dark, practically inescapable setting, and turn a rabid beast loose on them! Ridley Scott did it first, and best...the rip-offs fail miserably by comparison.<br/><br/>This film is highly atmospheric. So, wait for a cold, dark night...preferably windy, rainy, miserable. Shut off all the lights...grab a blanket...turn the brightness slightly down on your TV (I found the DVD transfer TOO good with Alien, it helped to re-create the sense I got when I first saw Alien on a tiny, bad little TV set) Trust me...the less you can make out in the darkness of this film, the more effective it is...<br/><br/>Just a quick thing...sorry to grab your quote donstuie, but it's so apt it's worth re-iterating here (this is from the Alien message boards): ""The simple fact is that it's much easier now to make people jump, gross them out, and blow stuff up, then it is to scare them. And not only that, more people will see something that has shock value or lots of thrills, than a brooding and disturbing horror movie. It sucks, but that's reality. Audiences today think Saw and Hostel are horror movies for God's sake!"" So true, donstuie, so true... I hate to say it...but they just DO NOT MAKE movies like this anymore!"

","""In Space - Nobody Can Hear You Scream""<br/><br/>Back in the summer of 1979- I was a high school freshman to-be, and this movie swept me off my feet, and rocked me to the core. It was truly the most frightening movie I have seen, since the first Exorcist. After the original Star Wars- I was fascinated by space, space travel, and strange beasts. This movie satisfied all those requirements- and then some. The eerie, comic-book imagery of H.R.Giger's artwork was a sci-fi fantasy come true. The Alien itself is a Phantasmagoric piece of art, in my eyes. Ridley Scott did a remarkably wonderful job of jogging our imaginations, fears, and nerves, with this classic. Hooray for Sigourney Weaver being the first female sci-fi action heroine!"

"KUAlum26","9","0","1","21 April 2007"," Creating a Sci-Fi/Horror hybrid that still resonates
","From Horror movie/Science Fiction film encyclopedias and books on film theory I've read,whenever the story on Ridley Scott's Alien is brought up,there is some mention on the way the show was received when it was first released in the late Spring,early Summer of 1979,was something akin to a truly jarring discovery. And,indeed,looking back on it now,how WOULDN'T a movie set in outer space that involves the following elements: a bleak,non-descript future,seven characters who are neither scientists nor space heroes/fighters and a sleek,nightmarish looking creature with awesome and unearthly traits(i.e. acid for blood,parasitic reproduction,an exponential growth rate among them),be a shock to audiences who were primarily used to more conventional forms of alien life(examples:The Day the Earth Stood Still,2001:A Space Odyssey,George Pal's War of the Worlds,Star Wars,Star Trek)or the future for that matter(again with Star Trek or 2001). Even in Howard HAwks' The Thing(remember,this is 1979,three years before John CArpenter envisioned the same movie),the killer creature seemed to take on a familiar face,even it was similarly lacking in mercy or reasoning as the creature in this movie. Approaching thirty years after its release,Alien still inspires imagery that is as wild and fantastic as it is horrific and sickening. <br/><br/>You're probably familiar with the story by now: The Nostromo(which is something akin to an interstellar cargo/trucking ship)is signaled to a barely charted and presumably unsettled planet in the dark reaches of the galaxy. The crew of seven with the aid of an overhead computer named ""Mother"" investigate.When one of the members of the exploration group,is attacked by a small indescribable alien creature on the planet's surface,he inadvertently brings aboard an unknown and highly deadly insect-like life-form that picks off each member of the defenseless crew aboard their ship after they depart the planet. Three of the crew,Ripley(Sigourney Weaver,in really her first major role and what a role it was!),PArker(Yaphet Kotto)and Lambert(Veronica Cartwright) discover that this stowaway may be more than a mere incidental pick-up,it becomes as much a battle for individual survival as it is trying to desperately rid themselves of the unwanted visitor.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott has since crafted quite the compendium of films,ranging in scope and material,from the awesome sense of machinery and the future in such pictures as this one and Blade Runer,to sometimes much more sublime,yet awesome imagery like Thelma and Louise or Someone to Watch Over Me(or,for that matter,awesome,Sci-fi-like imagery and epic power like Gladiator),but it was this movie that put him on the map. Using a fairly unknown cast at the time(Tom Skerritt is the closest to an ""established"" star at the time,even though Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Kotto were well-regarded character actors before and after this movie),and an ambitious script by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Schusett,Scott is able to create something that,like the creature itself,laid an egg in movie-viewing psyches and hatched something awesome. Spawning(no pun intended)three(not counting Alien vs.Predator)sequels so far,this movie has created quite the fertile storyline for strings of graphic novels and fanfics. My personal experience with it was watching something out of anxious curiosity:I finally watched it as a much older person(I was only seven when this show was released,and this is SO NOT a movie for the kiddies!)and it was tough for me to sit still through much of it,even KNOWING much of what was coming from reading synapses and hearing other people's stories of seeing it. Perhaps not a must of movie viewing,but a VERY effective movie-viewing experience!"

","Two comments stand out about Alien in the review from Newsweek in 1979: One, that Alien reminds us that not all extraterrestrials are cute, as in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Second, that the movie is nothing more than a scifi haunted house story. The reviewer was really impressed by Ridley Scott's terrifying and claustrophobic telling of a very unwelcome guest on a deep-space version of the Edmund Fitzgerald.<br/><br/>Anyone who appreciates the craft of film making should too.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone really anticipated that the Alien, chest-popping, acid-dripping, chrome-toothed, eggplant-from-Hell answer to the little guys with the big heads in CEOTTK would become so ingrained in our national pop-culture. You can do a sock-head impression with your hand, have it pop out of some sort of surface, do a periscope swivel while you emit some sort of high-pitched shriek, and then have your hand scurry off . . . and everyone gets it! At the same time, anyone who has to sit by the fat, sweaty guy on the Southwest Airlines flight can do a Sigourney Weaver impression, when she gets face-to-face with Eggplant Boy.<br/><br/>Alien scared the pasta sauce out of me, sitting there in the UA Cinemas in the Spokane Valley, 28 years ago. Cripes, it was uncomfortable. What was even weirder is that, without the theatre's intention, the climate of the place matched the cold dampness of some of the Nostromo's interiors. It was hot out and the A/C in the theatre was doing double-time and a half while the critter picked off one member of the crew after another.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the ending, the infamous cat-saving scene and Sigourney in ribcage-length tee and panties. Stephen King, in a review of the best movies of 1979 in (I think) Crawdaddy Magazine, said that hyper-feminists and male chauvinists both groaned when Weaver's character, Ellen Ripley leaves herself wide open to attack when she saves the Nostromo's house cat. The Feminazis snarled that Ripley betrayed femalehood by doing something girlish, and the pigs in the audience, while drooling over Weaver, bra-less, and with buff buttocks clearly defined in her undies, snickered at Ripley's being just like a woman, stopping to save a stupid cat.<br/><br/>King disagreed with both of them. He pointed out that it was Ripley's ingrained humanity that caused her to do what all the armchair commandos were complaining about. We'd respect her less if she didn't do what a compassionate person would do.<br/><br/>I liked King's thinking, here. Sigourney Weaver became a star by portraying a woman with power who uses her intellect and strength to stay alive on the Nostromo. If she hadn't been compassionate, she would have been nothing more than a Terminatrix. Even the little bits of cotton stretched over boobs and butt made her seem more human, a more sympathetic character.<br/><br/>Well, I've thought this thing too hard. I recommend Alien for the three things all great action movies need to entertain: Empathetic characters, believable situations, and a great, great bad guy.<br/><br/>The Buick fangs and acidic blood are gravy on the mashed potatoes!"
"vip_ebriega","10","0","1","20 February 2007"," The '2001' of monster movies.
","My Take: A gripping sci-fi thriller that hides in the dark and leaps at you when you least expect it. <br/><br/>(This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)<br/><br/>If Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY revolutionized what we conceived of science fiction movies, then Ridley Scott's ALIEN is the 2001 of monster pictures. Here's a movie that takes something familiar (something as old as a space monster and the doomed interstellar crew in preys on) and serves the formula right. Add a touch of effective atmosphere and suspense courtesy of the slimiest, most streamlined monster in movie history since the shark from JAWS and you got a classic. I read a review of this film where the critic described ALIEN as a haunted house movie set in the infinity of space. I couldn't think of a better way to describe it. <br/><br/>It is in this film that we are introduced to the familiar plot (as of today) about crew members of commercial ship who come upon an alien roaming around their ship, killing them of one by one. This plot would soon be borrowed by other Sci-fi films, but only ""Alien"" does it right. Pretty unique for its kind. Unique too, is the film's use of super-advance technology, pretty new back then. The film is one of the first to exhibit the cryogenic sleep in space. I haven't seen anything as unique as that.<br/><br/>The film does all the Sci-fi things right, and even goes beyond its knowledge. Ridley Scott does it with great creativity, making up for some little-known flaws in the film. Little-known because Scott does what needs to be done, and done right.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","Alien will always remain one of my favorite horror movies. Everything in here is very original. The music score is something to treasure. The Alien's design is so original. It is something more exotic than those green buggy eyed aliens you see in movies like 'Independence Day.' (It can't be buggy-eyed because it has no eyes.) It is the perfect predatory design.<br/><br/>Alien takes place in a commercial space ship named 'The Nostromo.' The Nostromo receives a signal, or a warning as they soon found out, about a strange planet. The crew decides to investigate this planet. On this planet, a giant skeleton of an Alien is found... with a hole in it's side. It soon becomes clear that something out of the ordinary happened to it. Near the skeleton, they find a huge cluster of eggs. One of the men approaches, and a hand-like creature pops out of the egg and latches on to the man's face. Later on, we find out that the hand-like creature had melted through the guy's space helmet. But then abruptly, the creature disappears.<br/><br/>Seated at the table, the crew eats dinner when something happens. The guy that explored the planet starts coughing. This coughing turns to wheezing. After wheezing, the rest of the crew sets him on a table. A spatter of blood appears on his shirt. Soon enough, a worm-like creature with teeth explodes out of his chest. The creature escapes, and the battle for survival is on...<br/><br/>The acting was very nice. Especially Sigourney Weaver, who really played her part as Ripley well."
"vocklabruck","8","0","1","7 January 2007"," Great movie if you think it was made in 1979
","I really liked Alien. It has a couple of flaws, but it is very scary. A great mix of sci-fi and horror.<br/><br/>This movie is impressive if you think it was made in 1979. The scenario and the music was great, so was the actors performance. Sigourney Weaver's acting was excellent considering it was her first movie.<br/><br/>What I did not like is that the pace turns very very slow sometimes and you can get bored. Also what's the matter with sound effects? The same sound effects are recycled all the time! You hear the same sounds when they type in keyboards, something is showed in computers screens or the doors are opened. This made me sick. It seems they lacked of sound effects or something. Another sound that bothered me off: heartbeat sounds! Why did they put this? Also the menacing creature looks like a man in a stupid crocodile suit. Anyway you never see the entire creature body until the end, so it does not matter how it looks. I think the creatures in Aliens, the sequel, look much better.<br/><br/>There are some flaws. If it wasn't for this I would have rated 9 or 10. The main flaw is the cat. WTF is a cat doing in a spaceship? This is not a cargo ship at the sea, this is a spaceship! It is even harder to understand why they look for the cat TWICE knowing there is an alien on board. Another thing, only a detail, but I will never understand how every member of the crew smokes in the spaceship as though it was so normal. Again this is a spaceship, not a ship at the sea!<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is very suspenseful and scary."
"charlessmith702210","9","0","1","16 December 2006"," Best of the 1970 Science Fiction/Horror Movies
","In these days where screenplay readers want movies in only one genre, this movie is an exception. A combination of science fiction and horror make forces to create what I believe is the best of the Hollywood movies in the 1970s since Close Encounters and even Star Wars Episode IV.<br/><br/>It is basically a movie about the Nostromo, a spaceship which had been said to contain a lot of treasure inside---and a small band of space treasurers risking life and limb to find the treasure before the alien monsters ruin their plans.<br/><br/>The part of the scene I liked in Alien was the conclusion, although I liked the middle of the movie where the crew members were fatally eaten alive on the Nostromo by the alien creatures. <br/><br/>It was so sad to witness Ripley figuring out that when all of his crew dies by the awful creatures, she decides on one of his crew member's advice to destroy the ship and go into an escape ship.<br/><br/>So, as I witnessed all of the attention on Nostromo's Emergency Destruction System that she activates, I think of that machine as the new monster with no alien monster inside. The system was designed to blow the Nostromo up in 10 minutes--with an option to override the system so that the ship would not self-destruct...but that option had to be used within 5 minutes! But the big problem was that since Ripley was overly obsessed with the monsters that killed all of her crew, she goes upstairs to the hallway to make sure that all of the monsters did not come out. All of this it haunts her so much that when she realizes that the 5 minutes were closing up and she goes downstairs to the self-destruction machine to try to get the override option to work---she procrastinated and the override option soon became ""no option"" as the 5 minutes elapsed quickly for her.<br/><br/>Now, with Ripley having absolutely no choice but to get to the escape ship before the whole Nostromo blows by itself in 5 minutes, she has to go to the ship very slowly through the hallway maze of smoke and flashing lights, because I speculated that any sudden movement of Ripley meant that the monster would strike her from anywhere and kill her. She does go to the escape ship in time at about T minus 1 minute. <br/><br/>She drives the escape ship just far away from the Nostromo, just in time before the Nostromo explodes several times into oblivion. And I thought that would be it for the movie. But this was what I call a ""false finale"", because later on, one more alien monster surprises her in the escape ship; but Ripley finds a way to stop it---putting on her space suit, and letting one of the doors of the ship open so that the strong vacuum of space would suck that monster up as it is forced back fatally into the darkness of space. And she does that, and it is all over for the film....<br/><br/>Ripley is saddened that she had lost a lot of money for this mission as well as losing all of her crew and the Nostromo."

","Wake me up when I see an alien. Alien came out in 1979 and yes, it is well done for a movie that is over 25 years old. I understand that people think it is scary since you hardly ever see the alien and that is why it is suppose to scare you. I just watched this movie again and found myself fast forwarding through most of it. This movie is just so boring I could barely stay awake. The pace of Alien is just to slow. It is good to build up the story and the suspense but there is also a point where you want something to EVENTUALLY happen. The story got built up and up and then you see the alien snarl at a few people and let out about 4 gallons of drool and then it gets blown out into space, the end. And yes, the cat survived, thank god."

An opinion that's strictly an opinion. The original version seems to hold up better as a ""docu-thriller"". Maybe that makes it scarier. The editing flows easier. The scenes have a better opportunity to play out. As a result, the tension seems to tighten as the story progresses. Director Ridley Scott, in the DVD intro pamphlet (but not in the DVD itself), admits he prefers the original version better. I gotta agree! But the new scenes ARE great scenes.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm biased. The earlier laser disc edition included those deleted scenes separately from the movie. So it's impossible feeling the same excitement of discovering this new footage for the first time edited into story form. Personally, I would have loved to see the deleted scenes added without losing any theatrical footage. Why? Great film making! Great story! And Great characters! Might have been more enriching.<br/><br/>But the 2003 version is still fun! No wonder there's legions of fans for 'Alien' and 'Aliens'.<br/><br/>Makes one of the best double features. Grab that popcorn and crank up that DTS and Dolby volume.<br/><br/>Well done, low key and flawless acting. Unique directorial style! The Sound! The Editing!

"robb_772","9","0","1","25 May 2006"," Justifiably considered a classic
","Director Ridley Scott's entry in the post-STAR WARS science fiction boom, the box office smash ALIEN ended up carving it's own niche in the genre and became a certifiable film classic in it's right. The film's plot is nothing new or revolutionary in and of it's self (the crew of a spacecraft is trapped onboard with a carnivorous alien who picks them off one by one), but Scott and screenwriter Dan O'Bannon wisely downplay the typical genre gimmickry in favor of a deceptively straightforward narrative. In fact, the film actually plays more like a psychological cat-and-mouse thriller than a routine space adventure, although the spacecraft setting lends the suspense a brilliantly claustrophobic atmosphere that possibly could not have been duplicated with an earth-bound setting. As the infamous tagline reads, ""In space no one can hear you scream."" <br/><br/>The film is benefited greatly from the exceptional art and set decoration, which is overflowing with rich detail and great imagination. During every scene, every shot, and every frame, the viewer is never less than totally convinced that they are in a lone spacecraft floating through the solar system. The Oscar-winning special effects remain highly convincing, including believable space travel and a highly memorable ""birth"" scene for the titular creature. The creature itself is marvelously designed, and Scott wisely keeps the alien hidden in the shadows for the majority of the film, therefore increasing the atmosphere and building suspense to an almost unbearable degree as the fear of the unknown intensifies.<br/><br/>The cast of characters includes an interesting assortment of tired working stiffs and various other misfits - none of these individuals are the virtuous heroes that plague most science fiction films, in fact most of them are simple space age truckers - this assignment isn't a mission to them, it's just a job. The cast is flawlessly chosen down to the letter, with Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, and especially Ian Holm (in a extremely chilling performance) all completely believable in their respective roles. Best of all is then-newcomer Sigourney Weaver, in a towering performance of strength and intelligence that is rare in this genre's typical characterization of women. Not only did Weaver's exceptional performance make the actress an overnight star, it also single-handedly defined the female action heroine for the post-modern era."

","Alien is without a doubt my favorite Sci-fi movie of all time. This is the movie that launched Sigorney Weaver and director Ridley Scott to stardom. Sigorney Weaver is in top form as the hard yet fragile Ellen Ripley which she does a tremendous job of playing. Ridley Scott hit a high with this one, i like a lot of his films especially ones like Gladiator and Blade Runner but this is my all time favorite.<br/><br/>At the time it came out it was given mixed reviews and with the treat of being over shadowed by Lucas's Star Wars where a lot of CGI and digital effects came into play, Ridley Scott's Alien over comes all.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott brilliantly created an spinetingling atmosphere where the viewer feels uneasy yet entertained, Scott is one of those directors who is great at creating worlds for cine-maniacs to get lost in.<br/><br/>This is the movie that set the stage for a lot of Sci-fi horror movies (i.e. Event Horizon, The Abyss) but even today with the amazing new special effects Alien stills stands on top."
"bonnie91","9","0","1","7 May 2006"," One of the best combinations of Sci-Fi and Survival Horror ever!
","Alien is a terrifying experience in another world, a world in the future and in another galaxy. As the title evidently infers, the movie is about an Alien that torments the crew of a ship that makes a landing on a planet from which a distress signal is being transmitted. What follows is some of the best shocks in film history and plenty of surprises that keep you guessing.<br/><br/>The Alien creature itself is a nauseating thing to look at, from its beginnings to adulthood, and has a way of doing things that are, well, unorthodox. And it looks like Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and company are pretty much out-powered from the get-go, although Ripley has a pension for survival and uses all the tricks in the book.<br/><br/>This movie has all the great special effects you would expect from a good science fiction film set in outer space, some groundbreaking for their time, which are still convincing today. For someone who hasn't already seen this classic, the best description I could give you is that it's a combination of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (some plot points) and Star Wars (special effects) with a little bit of Halloween thrown in for good measure (the Alien definitely has a psycho-killer attitude).<br/><br/>Lucky they made four of these, because after you see the first one you'll be left wanting more!"

","The film starts with the crew of a commercial ship wake from deep sleep. They are woken ten months ahead of programmed. The ship's computer (Mother) had seemed to pick up an SOS call. The crew land on the planet from where the call was made and after a bumpy landing they are stared there. As some of the crew work to get the ship up and running again a small group go out to see where the SOS came from. They come to a strange looking space ship and go inside. They find a fossilised Alien with his' chest of the outside. One of the groups goes down to what looks like a nest of eggs. Back at the ship Ripley finds out that the SOS call may be a warning. Then The group that went off to the space ship have come back the group member that found the eggs had a parasitic alien attached to his face and seems to be palsied. They try to cut it off him, but find its blood is acid and cannot be taken off.<br/><br/>Later the alien comes off on its own adored and the group member is fine. They fix the ship and started to head back to the mother ship in orbit round the planet. When at dinner and the crew are having an nice dinner the drew member that had the alien on him gets violently ill and a small alien pops out of his chest then runs away. Crew send his body to space and then try finds ways to kill the alien. After a few horrid deaths it becomes clear that the science officer is a robot of some kind and has orders to keep the alien alive at any cost.<br/><br/>Ripley kills him and the two last remaining crew members come up with a plan to kill the alien. The two get to work as Ripley goes to start to ships self destructed system. When she heads to an emergency ship she finds her cat and started to bring him to it. The other two are get killed by the alien and Ripley tries to stop the self destructed system but false and then has to make a speedy race back to the emergency ship and takes her cat. She just makes it to a safe way away from the ship as it blows up. She put her cat into deep sleep then starts to change for to put her self into sleep. The alien somehow mangles to get into the emergency ship. Ripley hides and changes into a space suite and then blows the alien out the air lock. It stills clings to the ship, but it sucked up into the engine blast.<br/><br/>I thought it was a good film and had some great parts in it. Like the scene where the alien pops out of the guy's chest. A classic film for it's day and has a good sic fie feel to it, unlike the Aliens and Alien3. Where in Aliens it's action and in Alien3 it's a horror."

","Alien is by far one of the best movies ever made because of 2 reasons. 1 It's very intense and 2 it's very scary. This is one of those movies that the tagline does fit: In space no one can hear you scream. When i saw this movie at the age of 8 I was so scared I had to sleep with my parents for a long month, now i'm a huge fan of not only the movie, but of the series. I have got alien, aliens, alien3, and alien resurrection. The best is aliens ( alien 2) because it's got Bill Paxton and if there where more lines for him it could be a comedy. Yes alien is one of those movies that is nearly impossible to re-create. I am a fan of horror, sci-fi, and action. Ridley Scott you put all my favorite genres in one big amazing movie called alien and I will never forget this masterpiece. This movie gets my vote for a major 10 out of 10. I will never forget this movie. It should'not even be called a movie, more like a blessing. Thank you god. Overall: Major 10/10"
"Cowman","Null","0","1","21 March 2006"," ALIEN is undeniably terrifying, but still suffers from a few flaws
","Ridley Scott's ALIEN is an immensely terrifying film. But the terror that it instills within the audience is of a kind that is sadly unknown to most viewers today. These days, what passes as ""horror"" is a mishmash of hyperactive editing, cheap scares, bad rock music, and explicit death scenes. ALIEN is the antithesis of all that.<br/><br/>ALIEN is a classic exercise in substance over style. Granted, it *is* a remarkably stylish film. It's hard not to notice the flashy visuals, the exhaustingly intricate production design, and the terrifying creature effects. But what's unique about ALIEN is that it never actually depends on any these elements to scare the viewer. It's already a frightening movie at its core; it just uses these elements to enhance the scares and add more believability to the story. Whereas most other big-budgeted horror titles rely solely on their special effects and lavish production values to frighten the viewer, ALIEN doesn't have to--its enthralling storyline, crafty camera-work, and masterful direction are effective enough on their own.<br/><br/>What makes the horror of ALIEN so successful is that it sets up a feeling of anxiety and dread in the very beginning, and continues to slowly and gradually pile on the tension until the explosive climax. There are long, lingering shots where nothing seems to happen and characters don't communicate with one another--yet, the amount of tension in these scenes is unbearable. You *know* something just isn't right. The film creeps along rather slowly, even after the alien life form is discovered and makes its way aboard the ship. The entire time, you're expecting the worst; and yet, oddly, you never see it coming.<br/><br/>After twenty-five years, ALIEN still succeeds in being an exceptionally nerveracking picture. But there are a handful of areas that appear dated or otherwise out of place. Most obviously, the ""futuristic"" computers and electronics onboard Nostromo are clunky and primitive--almost laughably so. But since personal computers were still in their infancy during the time of production, an issue such as this is easy to overlook. What's puzzling, though, is the discontinuity regarding the special effects. In most of the SFX-intensive sequences, the effects are carried out with striking realism, even by today's standards. But in other scenes, the creature appears to be nothing more than a rubbery hand-puppet, or in a couple instances, a guy ambling around in an alien costume. There's also a startling jump-cut that substitutes a prosthetic head for the actor's real head that is more distracting than effectual. While none of these unbefitting visuals ever actually detract from the quality of the film, one must wonder why these few instances of special effects artistry are so mediocre while the rest are nothing short of amazing.<br/><br/>Parts of the plot were hackneyed and predictable, particularly the false scare involving the cat and the entire subplot about science officer Ash being a robot bent on destroying the crew and transporting the murderous alien to Earth for the United States government. I found this part of the story to be totally forced and completely unnecessary, even detracting somewhat from the perfect simplicity of the plot up to this point (although it did make for some interesting anti-governmental themes). And I'm all for on screen titillation, but were those prolonged Sigourney Weaver underwear shots really necessary? Still, despite these minor gripes, I still consider ALIEN to be among the greatest and most well-made sci-fi/horror films I have ever experienced--not to mention one of the scariest!"

Everything else i have seen in the last twenty plus years is just a poor attempt to conjure up the magic and mystery of this film.

"kevinwelland","10","0","1","13 March 2006"," Sci fi blockbuster.
","This is truly the best sci fi horror of all time,and the film which gave us Sigourney Weaver as the first true Hollywood heroine. The plot is simple. A crew of 7 astronauts is put in peril when an alien being invades their space craft. The moment when the creature bursts out of John Hurts chest is without doubt one of the classic film moments of all time. After that, the crew is slowly wiped out one by one, until we are left with Weaver as the sole survivor. She must do battle with the alien to survive. Ridley Scott does a wonderful job with this one. The set is very claustrophobic, you can almost imagine yourself on board and feel the tension the characters are feeling. Watch out for the scene in which one of the male crew members has to go and look for the ships pet cat. Walking through spooky areas you are waiting for the moment the alien is going to jump out on him, but it only happens when you least expect it. A great film, and one that still holds up today."
"Hellrazr360","8","0","1","10 February 2006"," A Good Horror Movie Through and Through, But Not That Scary
","Alien is one of those movies that takes the horror genre and demands it to really be recognized. Now it's hard for people to talk about horror classics without mentioning how they were freaked by Alien. But is the movie really that scary? In my experience in watching it, I'd say no to that.<br/><br/>Right from the credits rolling through space the movie reveals its dark and dramatic approach to horror movies. The effect works surprisingly well in the fact that the viewer gets the feeling that they are a passenger on the ship (forgot the name). Seven people, lucky number right? Well, how about we land on an unknown planet and bring along an alien as an eight passenger? Ridley Scott takes all the precautions necessary to make Alien a believable film in and of its plot. Not once does the movie fail to impress the viewer with a thought of ""Could this really be space travel in the future?"" Another thing I liked about Alien was that the character development was impressive. Almost right from the start the viewer knows who's who and they get to know and love each person before, well, we'll let the movie speak for itself here. Not one actor/actress seemed inappropriately cast, and it's this that makes almost each passenger aboard the ship seem like family to the viewer. At least, this effect lasts for the time being until almost all of them are pretty much slaughtered or stealth-killed as if the alien were Sam Fisher.<br/><br/>That's another thing to give Alien a lot of credit for, the Alien itself. Yes, Ripley might be the most recognizable character in the Alien movies, but Alien makes the alien of the movie a character of its own. Whether the alien is CGI or not it seems like he's one of the passengers, just the very angry and not-so welcome one. Another thing I found astonishing with Alien is the special effects in general. Right when you see the ship in space you'll be amazed with how real it looks for a film of the late 70's. This is one effect that makes Alien a movie to really pay attention to in its own age.<br/><br/>Now, let me be honest with you on this part. Everyone says that this is possibly the scariest movie ever, that every time they watch it they are scared by it. So, I rent it, put it in my DVD player late at night alone and start watching it. And you know what, even though it caught my attention with a few suspense-filled moments, it just didn't scare me. Although the movie does hit you in the gut with each person that's attacked you'll already know that something has to happen, with an Alien on-board and all. So most of the deaths in Alien come as no surprise to the viewer, with the exception of one or two passengers. I might not have been scared, I'm going to be completely honest with you, I just wasn't, and the movie might've dragged on for me, but it had me interested. It's just that for a movie with so much credit as being scary I expected a lot more.<br/><br/>Alien is, in and of itself a good movie, no doubt. You get a great plot, memorable characters, nice special effects and the movie captures the true essence of horror movies. But as a scary movie in the horror movie regard it just didn't deliver for me. This is the biggest letdown I can tell of the movie but I still enjoyed watching it."
"osnelgro","9","0","1","9 February 2006"," HORROR! Not action
","I saw the first alien before any alien movies, now that I've seen the all I must say that Alien is horror and not action. It has many scene's where it seems to be very scary such as the many scene where someone is alone, you know that the killer alien is after them and all of a sudden you hear, to me that is very scary. I believe that Alien is the first movie where a woman is the hero which after 'alien' has happened many more times, which in a makes the movie more scary because women naturally ain't as strong as men.<br/><br/>'Alien' is about spaceship that is heading back to earth when all of a sudden the ship gets an S.O.S. signal from another planet, the ship then heads off to the planet to see what's going on. On the planet one of the crew members has an alien life form jump on his head that breathes for him to help him survive, eventually it jumps off his head and shrivels up and dies Everything seems fine but it turns that the alien life form planted a killer alien in the mans stomach which escapes and runs wild on the spaceship.<br/><br/>Director Ridley Scott has performed a great miracle making this movie, he has turned your usual nineteen fifties usual Sci-Fi movie in to a movie that if it was done up a bit is the same sort of film that we watch today. I didn't become obsessed with this film but I do respect the obvious aspect that when it was made it would have been fantastic.<br/><br/>'Alien' is also good because it has a boring start that goes nowhere that gets you used to the very different characters who slowly morph in to characters all very similar because they are all very afraid in the exact same way. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) plays a character that is just like all the other characters and doesn't play the main character until the end when she takes complete control and you feel very confident with her.<br/><br/>In conclusion 'Alien is a very entertaining movie with a few twists and turns but keeps the very real suspense. The landscape is very futuristic that makes you feel very exited because you don't know what can happen next. Ridley Scott has made a masterpiece and for it's time would have been a brilliant masterpiece that only a very creative mind would be able to come up with.<br/><br/>In space no one can hear you scream."

","Alien is getting old, but it hasn't lost any of its appeal. There are some people out there who are gonna try to tell you its ""outdated"" or that its ""running out of steam"". Those people suck. While we can argue about the film's merit, one thing we can all agree on is that in general, some people simply suck. And the people who disrespect this film definitely suck.<br/><br/>Thats sorta why I like Alien. Alien doesn't discriminate between people who suck or don't suck, Alien is simply hungry.<br/><br/>Now, its true this film has a slower pace. Essentially, this is what we in the know like to refer to as building tension and suspense. You also don't see the Alien up close all that much. Whether that was an artistic choice or a budgetary solution is up in the air, but it works because Ridley Scott is a master film maker.<br/><br/>The film begins by building an incredibly realistic atmosphere, directly contrasting the cartoony feel of Star Wars and sci-fi in general. Going with the incredibly surreal not to mention nightmarish designs of Giger's cannon was truly inspired. Never has there been a more terrifying yet beautiful, intriguing yet grotesque creature as the ""Xenomorph"". <br/><br/>In the sequels to follow, we learn more about the insect-like life stages of the xenomorph and its various stages of growth. Its all really cool stuff that is more sophisticated than it actually needs to be. You can read into it enough to explain the almost human-like proportions/configuration of the xenomorph that appears in this film, and the dog-like xenomorph that appears in film 3.<br/><br/>Alien truly was an amazing film and along with Blade Runner, has solidified Ridley Scott as one of the sci-fi gods. You can still find references to these films today and its a trend that will likely continue well into the future... whatever that future may bring.<br/><br/>Some people on here worry that teenagers won't appreciate this film; I disagree. I think they'll be channel surfing late at night and come across a sci-fi marathon with movies like Planet of the Apes and 2001 and sit back and be blown away."

","Brilliant design, cinematography and ensemble acting.The strength of this film is that, unlike its sequels, it has relatively little gore, and instead slowly and calmly builds up a sense of suspense and stark fear. Cold and detached in its storytelling. This is my favorite sci-fi film of all time.<br/><br/>Designs by Hans Rudi Giger, Ron Cobb and others are so otherworldly in appearance, that it more than anything before it (with the possible exception of 2001:A space odyssey)makes the audience feel convinced that all this is possible. Cinematography is equally beautiful, and the cold tone of the film, coupled with its patient sense of pace, makes this an original that makes its sequels (by lesser directors) pale by comparison.<br/><br/>The acting by all seven actors is superb. No one is the star, all are essential. <br/><br/>As Star Wars is set in a fictional world in no specific time period, I do not consider it to be actual science fiction, but a brilliant space fairy tale. So as much as I love the Star Wars saga the title of sci-fi champion belongs to Ridley Scotts Alien"

So far, Ridley Scott did an excellent job as director and still does (see Gladiator).

A small crew lands on the desolate planet and one of them is attacked. They return to the ship but unknowingly they've brought an alien life form on board. The alien creature and it's manifestations are by weird sculpture and painter H.R. Giger. What sets this film apart is the incredible acting and characters. Sigourney Weaver and Tom Skerrit have good chemistry. Ian Holm, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Kotto are all individual and outstanding in their roles.

","When we come to know that Ash (is that the character?) is an android, then the essence of the film is revealed. It is a robot that doesn't respect the three famous laws (remember Asimov's _I, Robot_) and that has been programmed to get a unique objective: get hold of that strange creature which has been found in a distant planet. In order to do so, it is allowed to kill all the crew, who is declared expendable. But... what is that which is so important? It is, no more no less, what the robot considers to be the most perfect creature in the universe (and which to the rest of the viewers is just a vicious destroyer). The robot has been created by some kind of Nazi, obsessed with purity of race, with organism perfection. And that is what the creature stands for: perfection, a sort of Super-Man (a-la-nietzsche). But it comes under a monstrous, disgusting appearance, reflection of what it really is about to bring. In that sense, to me, Alien represents the dangers of looking for perfection. That quest implies fights among people, dilemmas, having to toy with life and death, paranoia... Had it not been for the robot's orders to get samples of that perfect creature (commands dictated by some humans on Earth who we never come to know), nothing would have happened and Nostromo would have come back to Earth."

We need to go back and find the origin and we need to start to pressure Ridley Scott to get back at the helm and lead us once more into deep space as an act of homage to Ripley and the crew of Nostromo. So start writing and maybe we can get some sanity back to one of the greatest movie series ever created"

","The movie which forever changed the sci-fi genre, taking elements from past monster movies, going against the spotless visuals of 2001 to create a new vision of the future and one of the most atmospheric movies ever. Rarely does this genre produce a film which inspires acclaim from fans and critics, but Ridley Scott's 1979 classic does just that, beginning a famous franchise, story, character and monster, and spawning many inferior clones.<br/><br/>Some time in the future, mankind has the capability of effective space travel, with many planets holding outposts. We are introduced to a crew of miners who work for an all-powerful Foundation, and are returning home on their massive ship the 'Nostromo' after a long period of work. The crew are Dallas-in charge, Parker and Brett-mechanics, Ash-doctor, and Ripley, Lambert and Kane. However, they have been awakened from hyper-sleep early, by it seems an SOS signal. They discuss what to do, eventually deciding that they must investigate. They follow the call to a planet, and Kane, Dallas and Lambert go outside for a closer look. They discover what appears to be a crashed ship of unknown origin, and some sort of organism attach's itself to Kane's face. Tension grows as they try to take the creature off, but eventually it goes by itself. Kane wakes and seems to be OK. Soon though, things turn nasty, and a creature is lose on the ship. The remaining crew members try to find it and kill it, but it has grown, and is violently hungry.<br/><br/>Alien works primarily because of three factors. 1. The performances are all immaculate, with some actors giving career bests. Weaver is immensely strong coming to movies from the stage, the veterans all take it seriously even though it first appeared to be a silly scary movie, Holm is extremely good as Ash etc. 2. Scott's taut direction adds an edge to the script, his stunning visual style giving the sense of isolation and fear perfectly, the lighting is effective, everything is wonderfully detailed and he knows that less is more when it comes to showing the monster. 3. Geiger's creature is terrifying, and one of the best monsters ever made, beautiful, sultry, horrifying, mysterious, mechanical and deadly, everything a predator, and a monster should be. The story itself is strong, but it is these three factors which raise it from B-movie status, as well as some truly memorable scenes-The chest burster, Dallas in the tunnels, Ripley's final encounter, and Ash's revelation. The film is incredibly intelligent at a time when sci-fi movies were taking over, and it is one of the few which still remains powerful today. Everything about the film is near-faultless, but perhaps it suffers slightly from being too detached or cold. This is a minor complaint clearly. The set designs, the creation of the Alien and the face hugger are all realistic in the sense that we believe these things could conceivably exist. It is definitely the stuff of nightmares, an unseen foe stalking us, seemingly without weakness or emotion, its single motive to kill us. The recent director's cut shown in cinemas proved that the movie can still excite audiences, even those who have seen it several times, and there were certainly screams when I saw it.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"boo_4ever","9","0","1","1 April 2005"," Absolutely shocking
","When watching this for the first time I think was the most scared I have ever been in my life.<br/><br/>Alien is just beyond masterpiece. It drips with homicidal genius from each cell. It intrigues you and scares you in equal measure. You want to find out more about this thing which haunts space yet at the same time you're too scared to venture that far.<br/><br/>Like a lot of the old classics Alien takes a while to set its scene. Its about half way through the film that the alien finally starts its attack. But its not boring. The atmosphere cuts through the your bone. The lighting and music lull you into a constant state of dread. Even when the coast seems clear you know that something isn't quite right.<br/><br/>Purists will rate Alien as the best of the series. Personally I prefer Camerons Aliens but there isn't much in it. The reason I like Aliens is the all out war between the marines and the aliens. Its fine bumping off a bunch of mechanics but lets see what this species can really do....<br/><br/>Alien is a haunted house film in space. If I'd known there were haunted houses like that on earth Id never sleep again."

","OK, who hasn't seen ""Alien""? I believe that nearly everybody belonging to the age group of 30 - 50 (like me), have the shocking scene of the ""chestbuster"" alien coming out of the poor crewman's belly forever imprinted in their minds... ""Alien"" was a pioneer and trend-setter in the sci-fi thriller/horror genre, and it manages to stay that way despite 25 years of age and numerous sequels and similar films.<br/><br/>In ""Alien"", we watch the crew of spaceship Nostromo, who are on their way to Earth, eager to go to their homes, and get their pay and stock bonuses by their employing firm. However, Mother, the ship's computer, detects an SOS signal, and diverts their course completely to get them to the planet where the signal originates from; the crew has been on a hibernation-type of sleep, and wakes up completely unaware of this diversion. Grudgingly, Dallas (Skerrit), the ship's captain, with two crew members, go on an S & R mission so as to get this over with as soon as possible and leave. However, a mysterious creature (the ""alien"") attacks one of them, hugging his face with its long, disgusting tentacles, and the trio rushes back to the ship in panic. Second-in-Command officer Ripley (Weaver) refuses to let them inside the main part of the ship, for quarantine purposes, but the science officer Ash (Holm) disobeys her. Things go downhill from there, as Ripley's fears about the danger prove to be well-founded, and the alien brings total havoc to the ship and crew...<br/><br/>This is the film that made Sigourney Weaver famous, and it is true that she delivers a very good performance as heroic Ripley. Yet, I believe that there other performances are equal or even superior than hers, as for example Ian Holm's as the cold and mysterious science officer.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's direction is very good, with lots of impressive effects (for the 70's standards, at least). He keeps his audience on a non-stop fright journey, without letting the adrenaline down for a minute. Contrary to ""Alien 2"" (I haven't seen the rest of the series) which is more of an action/adventure than of a horror/thriller film, ""Alien"" is definitely a typical representative of the latter category. 8/10."
"ryan_kuhn","9","0","1","13 February 2005"," One Alien Is Plenty
","The Alien saga began with the best one, when there was only one Alien to be seen. The simplicity of the story is the key. One Alien, one claustrophobic ship, and 7 crew-members are the entire cast of this 1979 thriller. Directed by Ridley Scott, Alien has a sense of unease, a fear of what will happen next. The setup to the movie is wonderful, scary looking beings that we have never seen before invade our minds, we only catch quick looks off the actual being, mostly when it's young and popping out of John Hurt's stomach, in the most gruesome, yet famous scene of the movie. Sigorney Weaver plays Ripley, a rare female hero in a science fiction movie. She is a strong character, one cunning enough to ultimately defeat the Alien creature at the end of the movie. But the most important part of the movie is the suspense, mostly in what we don't see. As I said, we do not see much of the actual Alien creature. In the most tension filled scene, the Alien is not seen, just a dot on a computer screen chasing down another dot is all that gets the audience to fear it. Dark, claustrophobic, and selective of what we see, Scott does a great job of giving the audience what he wants us to see, not everything we need to see. The simplicity in the story is what makes it a gem."
"grahamsj3","8","0","1","28 January 2005"," Wow!
","This is the benchmark for Science Fiction films to aspire to attain. The film's Director, Ridley Scott, already a ""known"", was catapulted into the forefront with this one, along with the entire cast. The acting in this film is superb by the entire cast, but most especially Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit and Ian Holm. The fact that the entire cast consists of only 9 or 10 characters must have made it easy to work together. The special effects work is absolutely first-rate also. The action comes thick and fast after a sort of slow but necessary start. Once it begins, hold onto your hat! Alien is, far and away, the best film of it's genre that I've seen in years."

","I think that the ultimate example of futility is the use of terms such as overrated, simply because there are obviously no axiomatics at work in the preferences of a film. I would also like to comment on how this reviewer delved too deeply, for his own sake ,into the cytology of this particular film. The intent put into the atmosphere of the film was never to instill fear by usage of the character development, but rather use the atmospheric moodiness to surround the viewer with a unsettling claustrophobic dissonance from this realm. I cannot fathom why people take even the most infinitesimal sum of time to dwell on a film they just don't happen to like because of biased opinions, let alone put their opinions out into the public."

"nebbo","Null","0","1","10 November 2004"," A classic Gothic horror tale
","I couldn't not comment on this film in response to MovieCritic2003, who seems to dislike ""Alien"" because it is not ""Aliens"". Different director, different plot, different tone, different characters, different scenario. Even at the tender age of 17, when I first saw ""Alien"" (btw the scariest film I had ever seen up to that point), I recognized it as a classic horror/suspense/Gothic story, albeit in a sci-fi setting. Ridley Scott is a genius for creating atmosphere, and ""Alien"" succeeds at many levels. These are ""regular folks"" dealing with something completely beyond their experience. They are ""merchant mariners"" and miners, and they respond accordingly. It's silly to compare them to the hardened Colonial Marines from the sequel."
"ravravk","9","0","1","31 October 2004"," A truly Great Film
","Alien has become fully franchised, unfortunately so like all good things. When I first watched this film more than twenty years ago, the terror and horror were not due to the double-mouth or the creepy thing with the prehensile tail. The gut-splitting scene was horrifying but not the best. I experienced the terror because Scott was careful enough not to show the Alien too many times. In fact, only towards the end you get a good look at the thing. At other times, it is for the fraction of a second, no more. During the entire length of the film, you know that this thing is somewhere in the ship, may be in the engine room or may be in the accommodation, it can be anywhere. But you do not know it until you come face to face with it, and when you do, you are dead. It is classical horror, not the blood and gore/ face-with-third degree-burns formula that we see today. The suspense and the wait for the inevitable to happen- that sums it up. And then, like all great horror films (I do not know if I should really classify this as a horror film), that feeling in your stomach as you wonder if anyone in the crew will survive to get back at the monster at all! <br/><br/>Scott is excellent (and perhaps one of the few remaining in the English cinema) at using light. See his Duellists, Blade Runner and even that commercial Gladiator. Scott was an understudy of Kubrick and it shows in his films (I believe Jan De Bont was an understudy of Scott in turn, but in my view De Bont does not make good films. Period!). He uses light (or the lack of it) to the maximum effect throughout the movie, and space as the setting for the movie helps him. Whether it is the stranded ship (the one that sends them the SOS), or the inner recesses of Nostromo, it is the blend of shadows and twilight that drive the horror and terror of the movie. Good acting and script too helped. There is no excessive bonhomie or rivalry among the seven astronauts, they are friendly with each other but also professional. That makes the script more credible than its sequels. There are also minor twists in the plot along the way (for those who have not watched the movie and still are happily unaware, do follow the dialogue and scenes carefully from the time they receive the SOS, and see how the scientific officer does it) for those who follow these things but they do not detract. They add to the excitement and horror. Finally, this film is genuinely Sci-Fi.<br/><br/>Sequels followed, glorified by cover stories in national magazines. But none of them comes close. Aliens was made by Cameron, and it is more of a western set in space, with the good, the bad and the ugly clearly defined; there are no shades of grey. In fact, I do not understand why characterization is needed in such movies. You can make a good movie of this sort without imparting too much character to anyone or making a villain out of some hapless Yuppie. But then Cameron has no subtlety or art , and I do not much like his work. To date I fail to understand how Aliens became such a huge success. It probably appeals to the popcorn masses. About the third and fourth films in this franchise, the less said the better. More recently, there was this hit film on predator versus alien. In the interests of art and taste, such films should be boycotted by the general public."

","An absolute classic!<br/><br/>I have seen Alien many times, but I just watched AVP at the pictures and it forces you to go back and review one more time the whole Alien World. If you like Alien then you must buy ""Alien Quadrilogy"", this is the most comprehensive collection of Alien features.<br/><br/>I was born in 1979 so I can't quite fully comprehend what it must have been like for people to see it at the pictures, when nobody really knew much about it. People had just watched Star Wars and would be filled with the romantic notions of space and furry chewbaccas that it portrays.... this is very, very different!<br/><br/>It's just an absolute classic.... I've read the scrrenplay (in paperback format) and that's just mind-blowing as well, it adds a whole different angle to the film.<br/><br/>The acting, art, sets and atmosphere are all great...

"flingebunt","8","0","1","14 October 2004"," Take your pick
","There is something about the Alien series of movies which is very different from nearly every other series. Of the 4 movies made, different like different movies. Yes, most people like Aliens, which set the standard for soldier SF.<br/><br/>For myself, Alien is the better movie. Full of tension and interesting and real characters. The space ship nostramo is directed to investigate a signal from a planet. It turns out to be from an alien space ship. The bring an alien creature which is attached to the face of one the crew back onboard.<br/><br/>The creature is the ultimate biological weapon. It kills the crew one by one (most because the go into the darkest parts of the ship and say ""let's split up""...they deserve to die).<br/><br/>This movie brings a strong female lead in the character Ripley, who is as tough as nails (but still finds time to cry a little as well as going back to say the ship's cat).<br/><br/>Yes, in some ways the movie is a little slow. In fact, read the script, the opening is much more exciting on paper than in the way it was filmed (restrictions from 1979 era special effects). <br/><br/>Anyway, if you haven't seen the any of the Alien movies, watch the all. If you don't like one, there many be another you love. I hated Alien cubed (alien 3), but loved Alien, Aliens and found Alien resurrection interesting."

"Bobolopolis","9","0","1","1 October 2004"," One of my top three favorites of all time.
","Let me start off by saying this is a great movie. The setting, the characters, the creature itself, are all superb. It takes awhile to get into the true horror element of movies, but when the film does, it is a visceral experience. <br/><br/>It starts off when a Company (Weylan-Yutani/Weyland-Yutani in Aliens) spaceship is rerouted to intercept a transmission of unknown origin. When the crew sets off to investigate on the planets surface, they bring back an organism that is absolutely lethal when it encounters humans. It soon wreaks havoc on the ships crew picking them off one by one.<br/><br/>Whereas the sequel to the movie, Aliens is the favored movie out of all the Alien films, I feel that it just doesn't have the air of mystery around it like the original does. In Aliens we discover that the creature needs a Queen to further its lifecycle, whereas in Alien some of the horror came from not knowing what it was doing to the crew. <br/><br/>The film is shot pretty darkly to show the double-sided feature of man's technology. The ship goes from brightly lit and futuristic when the crew wakes up, to dark and spooky when they set off to look for the Alien in the Nostromo's underbelly.<br/><br/>What makes this film succeed in my opinion is that the creators of the film decided to throw in your average human beings into the mix. There is nothing superpowerful or outstanding about them, they are just your average joe, like all the other average blue collar folks out there. They are afraid, doubtful, and panic stricken yet always have hope that they can make it out of the ship alive. Just like 90% of the people without military experience that get stuck in horrible situations. These ""space truckers"" must find a way to defeat a seemingly unstoppable and stealthlike creature that is born to kill.<br/><br/>The set designs, sound and visual effects are all a bonus to a movie that I feel has dated extremely well over the last few years.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen one of the horror movies that helped define the sci/fi-horror genre, then perhaps you should go rent it as quick as possible.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","""In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream!"" That was the now-famous tag line from the 1979 horror/sci-fi classic thriller Alien. Ridley Scott directed this masterpiece about a spaceship sent to an unknown planet to respond to a unanimous message. Upon arriving on the planet called LV-426, they discover an abandoned spacecraft in which they found a sea of fertilized eggs. One of them opens up and a strange creature jumps out of it and sticks itself to the face of one of the crew member. After returning to their own ship, they start examining the creature still stuck to his face. The creature known as ""The Face hugger"", unstuck itself from the man's face, leaving him with no visible injuries. Everything seems fine until a small alien bursts out of the man's chest and escapes into the ship. The six remaining crew members must then prepare for battle for their survival against this alien who becomes pretty dangerous after they realize that it has acid for blood. In 1979, the science-fiction genre was at its all-time popularity peak after the release of Star Wars and 20th Century Fox wanted to cash-in on this sci-fi mania that was going on by green lighting the Dan O'Bannon script and hired a then-unknown Ridley Scott who had directed his major film debut with The Duellists in 1977. What is impressive in Alien, the original movie that started the franchise, is the work of Ridley Scott, who truly made a very scary movie and one that stands the test of time. H.R.Giger, who had painted a portrait of the alien creature long before Dan O'Bannon had written the script, designed the creature itself. Some people prefer the 1986 action extravaganza Aliens directed by James Cameron, but the original is still the one to beat and will always be. Sigourney Weaver made her film debut with what would become her landmark role as Lt. Ripley, the famous heroin who must defeat the hideous creature on her own. So if you like action, suspense and scary moments, Alien is the perfect horror movie and a true science-fiction classic. I give Alien a very good 9.0/10"

","Having watched the new Directors Cut of the film. I am reminded of when I first viewed it in 1980. I was in awe of the great sets, the claustrophobic feel of the space ship and the fact I could relate to the crew. I think it works well because 1. It has great set designs and the direction of Ridley Scott is excellent 2. The crew is convincing with that corporate image and you can relate to the criticism of the company. (Truckers in space) There is a hierarchy which is both male and female and the engineer team who feel they are belittled, but vitally important. 3. It was the first time a female was the lead action hero role which had been predominantly male. And though some may think that a half naked Sigourney Weaver was unnecessary. It makes her role all more powerful as she shows vulnerability in the presence of the alien. 4. Considering when it was made the overall feel of the spaceship looks very genuine and you feel that you are on the ship. 5. The Alien too, is convincing, not a rubber shark like creature but again a believable baddie. 6. It must have been difficult to try and make the film with a Hitchcock feel to it but the twist in the film is excellent. 7. To capture fear on film is not an easy task but Ridley Scott achieves it- which is what makes Alien a classic of its genre"

The story takes place in space, with a ship investigating a planet with a mysterious reading. When they reach the planet, something has entered<br/><br/>the ship and is killing the crew off one by one. Sigourney Weaver and Tom<br/><br/>Skerritt are good in the lead roles, while Yaphet Kotto, Veronica Cartwright, and Ian Holm are also good. The movie has too many slow paced moments to<br/><br/>actually be an exciting film. The sequel Aliens was superior. Alien is still a good movie, but was somewhat disappointing. 8/10 stars."

"gengar843","Null","0","1","16 May 2004"," I'm Lucky
","I saw ""Alien"" at the theatre in 1979. At the time, I was on a horror/ sci-fi binge. From 1977-1980, I went to the movie house to see STAR WARS, STAR TREK: THE MOVIE, PHANTASM, JAWS, HALLOWEEN, THE LAST WAVE, CARRIE, SUSPIRIA, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and loads of other great and not-so-great films.<br/><br/>I consider myself lucky to have seen films such as ALIEN when they were completely new and unknown. When this movie came out, it was a revelation. While STAR WARS gave us the technology that was so missing in earlier Sci-Fi, ALIEN was a gift of design, hearkening back to such efforts as FORBIDDEN PLANET and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. But more than that was the absolute deviltry behind it all. H.R. Giger's symmetrical ideas are the gross marriage of the human organism and the great machine. From the ""boneship"" which sends out the Warning beacon, to the hydraulic embodiments of the Nostromo, to the Alien itself, Giger's vision is nothing less than disturbing. In contrast, Ash's milky android is merely a shock vehicle. The Alien is, to me, the incarnation of Satan: invincible, unstoppable, human in form but completely alien, malevolent but calculating. The Nostromo becomes Hell for the crew in the same way that THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE converted a ""haunted house"" into a nightmare-world of sordidness. Another great revelation of ALIEN was Kane's demise. For the first-time viewer who has heard nothing (me in 1979), an eye-popping experience awaits.<br/><br/>Imagine being in the audience of the local movie-house, among the first to ever witness this! Another enjoyable feature of the movie was Veronica Cartwright. In 1979, I was 17. When I was 10, 11, 12, 13, LOST IN SPACE had been one of my favorite TV shows in reruns, after school. Does anyone else remember how wonderful those days were? While the character Lambert was not much more than a nervous Nellie, she was to me riveting, as I watched Penny Robinson all grown up, chain-smoking and cussing. Let me comment on the plotline also. I usually find many plot holes in Sci-Fi films. When I saw DEEP IMPACT, for example, I found the plot so objectionable that I actually engaged in a physical altercation with my movie partner. LOL With ALIEN, there was little to quibble over. Sure, Parker should've used the flamethrower rather than attack the Alien by hand; yet I DO understand Parker's unwillingness to put Lambert at risk. Some of the plot vehicles were somewhat convenient, such as the space shuttle's velocity near the end; but that falls under the heading of ""possible"" more than ""improbable."" I've seen this film probably a dozen or more times since the first, and it loses very little luster. Of course, I'm no longer surprised where the director intended, but the understated characterizations leave something to the imagination of repeated viewings (unlike the more conventional ALIENS) and Giger's panoply never fails to awe and disgust."

","Scott's 1979 'Alien' is one of the most emotionally manipulative films out there.  It is more horror than science fiction, mainly because the technology in the film is actually plausable and believable at the very least.<br/><br/>When watching 'Alien' again for it's special edition release at the cinema I actually found myself afraid at moments I had seen time and time again, such is the strength of the tension created in the film.<br/><br/>The Alien creature's life cycle seems second nature to most film fans now, but it must have been fascinating to see first time round.  Such is the modern-day legend created by the film that I was already partially aware of what I'd be seeing before I watched the film, even as a ten year old.<br/><br/>THis is a great piece of cinema, shot elegantly and with plenty of twists and turns to keep horror, sci-fi and drama fans happy for a couple of tense hours.  Don't let the entire hour of ""build up"" fool you-keep watchin and you're in for a hell of a ride!"
"Old Joe","Null","0","3","29 April 2004"," Supposedly in space no one can hear you scream'. This film is overrated and just not good enough in my view.
","In reviewing Alien', I want to say that this movie might have been better for me to see, back when it was released in 1979. I only believe this, because for some reason I could not completely get rapped up in it. That is not to say I did not like some of it. However, as soon as part of me was starting too really like it, I had an experience with this film that I found unwholesome and frustrating, especially with the ending, a feeling that I remember I had through another popular movie  Fight Club'. It is a shame, because the idea that Aliens are out there and are scary is totally fascinating to me. <br/><br/>The terror begins when the crew of the spaceship, Nostromo' investigates a transmission from a desolate planet and makes a horrifying discovery  a life form that breeds within a human host. Now the crew must not only fight for its survival, but the survival of all mankind.   <br/><br/>Director Ridley Scott was and still is praised for giving us one of the great horror/Sci-Fi classics. I was not in awe of this film, however I feel I could have been. Scott's direction is one of the main problems with this film. Firstly, the film is given a pace that for me is far too slow. I would have preferred the film to have a quicker pace which would have increased the tension. The other problem is the way that Ridley did not take full advantage of the Alien' aspect to the film, especially with the ending that we see Ridley present. But the fans really do make a big song and dance about this film and the director is one of the reasons for that.<br/><br/>
Yet the story to this film is also guilty of being weak, even underdeveloped. The screenplay was written by Dan O'Bannon, based on the story written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, which does have merits I have mentioned. But the story could have done so much more with the Alien' created. Also whoever devised the ending to this film did a terrible job, as I found it totally unsatisfying, bringing the film down for me. <br/><br/>Some of the actors and characters in this film are very good. At the start of the film we see the entire crew of Nostromo' awake. The ship is commanded by Dallas (Tom Skerritt), who cares more for his crew than for the actual space mission. Skerritt is pretty good as this character. Under Dallas is female commander Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who is a real find as female action hero. Ripley has balls', and I get this feeling from Weaver's performance. Ripley believes in following protocol, a big difference to Dallas. <br/><br/>Another interesting character is Ash (Ian Holm). With the discovery of this Alien life-form, Ash is genuinely excited instead of scared which is the reaction the rest of the crew give. What the movie reveals about Ash is quite unbelievable, but very interesting. While what happens to scientist Kane (John Hurt) might be a pretty ordinary demise, but another of the film's great moments. <br/><br/>
The rest of the crew (or cast) is not so great. The other female crewmember Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) is strange, as she does nothing more on this ship, other than whinge and scream. But more annoying than Lambert, are the two space engineers Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Stanton Brett (Harry Dean). This pair get along very well, suiting each other. These characters brought nothing inventive to the film, and are very frustrating. Seeing all these characters go' was a blessing, rather than upsetting in my view. <br/><br/>
I liked the Alien' effects that were presented here. The Alien creations themselves were wonderfully done by the special effects crew (Carlo Rambaldi and Bernard Lodge) and costume crews (John Mollo, H.R. Giger, and Roger Dicken). Everything from the creation that looks part spider, part female genitalia (which causes some of the great scary moments in the film), up to the actual Alien' we see, which is gruesome, but in its own way very attractive, were fantastic. This is one of my favourite areas of the entire film. <br/><br/>To be honest I first watched this film around 5 years ago, and was feeling so scared, I had to fast forward the DVD. Since that time, when I put this film on, I am waiting in anticipation for the movie to give me as much of that scared' reaction as possible, as that is the feeling I desire as I am watching it. But that experience is very limited in this film. So with all these factors, I have to say I am disappointed in Alien' and do not agree that this is a brilliant movie, in fact it is quite the opposite. What a pity!<br/><br/>CMRS gives Alien': 1.5 (Bad  Ok Film)"

","This movie is a good Thriller and a great start to a great trilogy, until Alien Ressurection anyway. This movie is great, it's Oscar winning special effects are great and the characters are great as well. Signorney Weaver is excellent for her role and Tom Skeritt makes a good team leader. Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Katto are funny at times and bring some laughs early in the movie. The Alien design by H.R. Giger is great and would certainly scare me if it snuck up on me in an airduct. If there is one thing about this that I didn't like, was the scene where the Nostromo blows up. It looks like a planet is exploding. I thought that they would change this in the Director's Edition but that didn't change the movie any. This is a good movie to show on Halloween night and scare you. Watch this and get scared!"

","This movie is the yardstick by which other Alien movies are measured. That's it, plain and simple.  I've heard that people find this movie boring or slow, and to that I say ""bah!"".  This movie is not an action movie, nor is it meant to be.  It is a suspense movie, and an excellent example of one. The cast is great, the story well written, and the scenery adds a grisly, metallic, ""film noir"" theme to the picture.  If at all possible, see this movie in theaters, there was recently a re-release, and it might still be out on some screens.  Seeing this movie on the big screen is an experience all in itself, and it is one of the few so-called ""scary"" movies I've seen that actually have a few parts which made me jump.  I'm not going to say which though, I'm opposed to putting spoilers in reviews, its unnecessary and just plain rude.  An excellent film all around.<br/><br/>P.S. If you haven't seen either Alien or Aliens, see this one first, I saw Aliens first, and didn't understand a few things.  Seeing Alien first explains alot."
"mattymatt30","9","0","1","22 March 2004"," This Alien isn't related to E.T.
","'Alien' is both formulaic and unique in many ways. The art direction and set designs are excellent, but similar in some ways to Star Wars. The virtually unstoppable and seldom seen alien is similar to the shark in Jaws. The story, members of a space crew being picked off one by one in a creepy ship, is like the classic 'Ten Little Indians'. What makes the film unique is in the sum of its various parts, and in its innovations.<br/><br/>
  POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD: The concept of having the Alien gestate inside a human body and burst out is incredible, and provides one of the most memorable scenes in horror/sci-fi film history. Also, the scene with Dallas in the air shafts, the alien closing in but seen only as a blip on a tracker, is really exciting and quite unique. That scene was even parodied on 'The Simpsons', when Groundskeeper Willie was hunting for Bart's dog in the school's air vents. The film is made up of groundbreaking elements, and that's what made 'Alien' more than just a formula monster movie. It's sequel, 'Aliens', added more of an action element , but the later sequels were a mistake."
"ks4","9","0","1","13 March 2004"," Groundbreaking psychological sci-fi terror!
","Seeing this movie now in 2004, is a bit funny, first of all many of the scenes in the movie has become somewhat a cliche, and this has obviously been ia inspiration for many movies to come after.<br/><br/> But obviously this is one of the milestones in the cinematic history, even though it is from 1979 it is still a fantastic and stunning movie, both visually and psychological, as i wrote on topic.<br/><br/> There are many good points of this movie, first of all the script is absolutely great, gripping, original and controversial, full of different twists, some more obvious than others, one of the best scenes of the movie is the one where Ash turns out to be a computer, and the following interviewing scene, a scene that can definitely come up for debate of our curiosity for finding foreign and unknown organisms to explore, are we perhaps too curious and eager? Not something i'm gonna discuss with myself here, but it's an obvious opinion there, and something Ridley Scott may be very interested in exploring more, which he has done already with Blade Runner i guess.<br/><br/> Another strong side, and again, praise to Ridley Scott, the direction of this movie is nearly perfect, i can't find any spots to put my fingers on and criticise, all i can say is that he did a fantastic job creating a atmosphere that stuck to your back, again, some things here have been copied and thus seen before, but it is still one of the best direction i have seen ever, the work with the flickering lights, the many aspects of the image, the, at times, alternative and experimental use of the camera, there are so many good aspects of that, and this movie could have been a lot worse without Ridley in the lead.<br/><br/> The special effects really is the only point that annoyed me a tad, but considering the movie is 1979 and we are now in 2004, i don't think it's something i wanna get into, the monster so to speak wasn't viewed a lot of times, which added to the psychological part of the movie i think, the many silent scenes where you follow the characters is the real backbone of the movie, not the monster, which is good i think, horror movies shouldn't always be focused on what the eye can see, but maybe rather than on what the eye can not see.<br/><br/> 9/10"

So you find a mysterious ship, crashed on a scary moon or planet, and you JUST HAVE TO investigate, like you would think that hundreds of years into the future they would have grown brains or something. So you send down a research team, and they keep going down the long, dark, scary tunnels, and just have to go down this shoot to find the pods where the aliens are made.

","The best thing in Alien is its naturalness. The way the crew talk, its spontaneity and casualness. They can be discussing a failure in a complex technological device in the ship, but nevertheless they do it smoking cigarettes and eating sandwiches, just as if they talk about the weather. When they press buttons one feels that they did it a million times before. They even play with the sliding doors to trap each other in order to be listened to. These circumstances makes Kane's death during a moment of> relaxed camaraderie so unforgettable and shocking. One is not prepared at all. No pomp, no memorable last words, just a funny comment about the quality of the food and there it goes. Like the two mechanics, Brett and Parker. One wonders what they are doing in such a mission, with their Hawaiian shirts and baseball caps, p****d off for working extra time or complaining about their low payments, as if they were in a factory. Just imagine the same characters in a bad script, wearing glasses and overalls, cutting off from the rest in the midst of trouble, challenging the others with their technical notions. They cannot stand a comparison. The Alien characters succeed in their improbability because they are not real; they are true.<br/><br/> Alien is more a script achievement than a directorial one. The story is so well written and solid in its structure that it could probably been as good with any other director. One thinks that Scott is more at ease with more baroque material, like Blade Runner. So there's little of the director's world here, it's definitely writer Dan O'Bannon's territory instead, a reinvention of the American horror genre, minimalist and philosophical, a big budget with a `B' premise.<br/><br/> Alien is not the best film ever made. It's not even the best of the saga (I consider `Aliens' a superior film). But one must admire the film's efficiency. Efficiency given solely by the characters, not always by what they say, but by the way they look at each other. These rules of the game are established right from the beginning, and are followed religiously thorough the rest of the film. There's nothing external altering this order, just as we hardly know anything about the world outside the ship. Alien's accomplishment is more in tune with films to-come as `The Thing' or `The Abyss'. Like the Nostromo ship, O'Bannon's story set voyage beyond the frontiers of the genre. Too bad that he didn't leave the irritating cat there."

","On subsequent viewings, I can be clinical, so I'll have to admit it doesn't scare me at all anymore. But when I saw it first day of release in the theaters, Ridley Scott's ALIEN was the scariest thing I had ever seen up to that point and long after. The mounting of atmosphere was the thing: By the point, about 20 minutes in, that Hurt, Skerrit and Weaver descend to that intestinal-looking ship, anyone seeing the film for the first time in 1979 felt so uneasy they wanted to leave, literally just get up, go shopping or driving, call a friend, and forget this unsettling film entirely. I have talked to other people who had the very same reaction. We were so scared, we actually thought our choice to see the movie had been a mistake --specifically, because the sense of foreboding was so thick.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to explain that reaction, not feeling exactly the same way about it any more. But I can see clearly, still, even after much of its impact has worn off on me, that it did something exceedingly well that most films these days fail at miserably: it created a sense of extreme dread and unease by the slow incremental building of atmosphere, block by block, without resort to a lot of juicy/gory violence. It accomplished this by the natural evolution of events and subtle revelation of terrain. The Ring did that exceptionally well, too, as did Carpenter's The Thing.<br/><br/>There is little more violence in ALIEN than in Hitchcock's PSYCHO from 20 years before. Like PSYCHO, ALIEN is an elegantly spare, judicious and intelligent attempt to scare the hell out of you. These films were made by really smart artists who realized that the geysers of gore their imitators latched on to as a major influence, and multiplied to the point of comedy in their films, are ultimately reductive. They force us to retreat into a cool appreciation of the FX and the scope of spectacle, and nothing more. The scares of PSYCHO and ALIEN are primal. Their feeling, distinct from the FX, taps the makers' deepest dread, and ours.<br/><br/>Ten stars. Approached in the right spirit, setting aside all the reams of films ALIEN inspired, it might still pack a wallop. It's hard for me to tell at this point. But it will always be, with PSYCHO, one of the two scariest films of my life."

","The late, great Pauline Kael said it best when she wrote about ""Alien"" (actually, she was reviewing ""Aliens"" but I digress).  She wrote ""Alien turned your insides into knots.  It made you dread the scenes to come."" Exactly.  When I saw this movie at the age of 14, I nearly couldn't breathe. I both wanted it to end and keep on going all at the same time.  Everything about it works: the cast, the effects and mostly, Ridley Scott's amazing direction.  By now his ""look"" has been copied so many times (and by his brother, Tony, as well) that to new viewers, the movie might seem old hat. But back in '79, this was a new, dark vision that was terrifying.  The Alien is truly a shocking, gruesome monster.  He/She's(?) your worst nightmare: a creature with no remorse, no soul.  Just a killing machine with no other agenda.  And you're trapped.  If you look at the film, there's actually very little gore (yes, except for the famous stomach bursting scene).  There is one complaint I have about ""Aliens"".  Once you have seen it, experienced it, it's done.  You will never feel the same sense of terror and doom that you feel the first time you see it.  You can marvel at how skillfully it's made and such but you'll never get that awful, nauseating feeling that it gave you upon the initial viewing.  I wish there was a way that I could have my brain wiped out of this movie (and a few others like ""The Godfather"") so I could experience them fresh all over again.  There's nothing like it.  That is what makes great film.  In this regard, ""Aliens"" is somewhat better.  You can enjoy the action in the film over and over again and pretty much feel the same way and catch even more that you might've missed the first time. BOTH films are excellent compliments to the other.  They're a complete set. Forget the other Alien movies.  They are not in the same league as the first two."
"FilmOtaku","8","0","1","8 November 2003"," It's a classic for a reason
","What an experience. Although I had seen Alien before, I was 12 years old and the nuances and suspense was apparently completely lost on me because I was terrified at several different moments while viewing the re-released Director's cut in the theater on Halloween.  I actually compare the experience to having seen Jaws again 15 years after I originally watched it. I knew I was scared, but I didn't realize how good the film was until I watched it again with more educated eyes.<br/><br/>Alien succeeds in its ability to take something as simplistic as the `searching for the intruder/foreign element/monster' plot device and turning it into both a horror film and psychological mind game.  We are more frightened *before* we see the Alien, but it is certainly no slouch when we *do* finally get to set eyes on it.  The acting is simply passable, but it was not necessary to emote much more than panic and screams in this film. <br/><br/>
My recommendation is to see the film and then do some research.  Simply by checking IMDB trivia facts I learned some fascinating background information that actually endured the film to me even more.  This is one of those films that people should see at least once, if anything, chalk it up to one of those films like The Godfather where having seen it will at least give you something to talk about at those pesky cocktail parties. <br/><br/><br/><br/>--Shelly"

","Is Director Ridley Scott's 1979 pop blockbuster a science fiction flick or a horror film? It is,of course a uniquely successful and ingeniously arty fusion of the two genres,one that really changed the face of high-tech Hollywood dread and launched a series of top-grossing sequels that started off with James Cameron's ""Aliens""(1986),and the two other installments,""Alien 3""(1992),and ""Alien Resurrection""(1997). This was basically a haunted house movie in outer space,the interstellar fright fest that started a trend toward futuristic grunge that shocked its audiences more than 25 years ago,and one of the scariest films of its era.<br/><br/>It also introduced an extraordinarily and scary silmy monster that gave its audiences a good shock out of their seats and gave a lot of them some very frightening nightmares. Not since William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" has a movie been so addictive in giving its audiences major chills,especially within the boundaries of science fiction itself. Add in actress Sigourney Weaver's career-launching performance,and you have a grand classic modern-day science fiction shocker that is well worth the revisit considering the scenes regarding actors Harry Dean-Stanton, Tom Skerritt,Yaphet Kotto,and Veronica Cartwright. The re-release is worth seeing,indeed,especially with the newly restored footage that adds in additional scenes,a remixed digital sound and also tighter editing."
"kintopf432","9","0","1","4 November 2003"," Chilly horror masterpiece
","A chilly horror masterpiece.  There's a meaty concept at play behind the spookhouse façade, a healthy--and slightly paranoid, in the best seventies sci-fi way--subtext about not trusting corporate and government establishments (here rolled into one in `the Company').  But mainly it's just a clammy horror movie, as the simple but well-drawn characters fumble around in the dark, alternately looking for the alien and running from it. Ridley Scott's technique is elegant, but we don't see as much of the stylistic polish (some would say pretense) here as we do in his later work. In this case, that's a blessing, as it gives the film an air of sweaty, almost `Das Boot'-like realism largely absent from his florid recent efforts.<br/><br/>The `Alien' series has had quite a mythology grow up around it, and it isn't hard to understand why.  There isn't really another movie series quite like it, with each episode being guided by a different, competent and completely distinct auteur.  It is not a flawless series--there are those who find `Aliens' too macho and thuggish, `Alien³' too black and misanthropic, and `Alien Resurrection' too self-indulgent and empty (and, perhaps, too badly acted).  But each film is so unique, and yet has so much in common with the others (the opening `wake-up calls,' the androids, the Company, and most notably, of course, Sigourney Weaver's iconic Ripley), that it's safe to say there's been no more perfect genre series thus far.  This first film seems to be the only one everyone can agree on, and I can see no reason to argue with that.  9.5 out of 10."

"DannyBoy-17","Null","0","1","2 November 2003"," This time, the Company is scarier
","You know, back when I was watching Alien 3 over and over again, as a big fan of David Fincher, I realized that perhaps the scariest element of the movie wasn't the alien: it was the Company.  Throughout the third film, Ripley is racing against time to avoid the Company's arrival to pick up and transport the alien to be used for their bioweapons division.  The same problem occurred in Aliens, and once again it happens here. <br/><br/>   Only in Alien, the personality of the Company is really embodied in Ashe (Ian Holm.)  I've seen Ian Holm do a wide variety of characters, but this character is chilling.  His performance alone makes us understand why Ripley so distrusts Bishop (Lance Henriksen) in Aliens.  He is the exact same as the ship itself and the space around him: cold, calculating, and unfeeling. Having to display any emotion besides determination is a bit of a NUISANCE for him.<br/><br/>    (SPOILER)  When only Parker, Lambert, and Ripley are left, Lambert makes the interesting point to Ashe: ""You admire it [the alien.]""  Ashe responds, ""I admire its purity of purpose: survival, unencumbered by guilt, remorse, or delusions of morality.""  The morbid fascination Ashe, and by extension the Copmany, shows for this killing machine chills me more than the machine itself, perhaps especially given the war-torn times we seem to be living in. Indeed, his attack on Ripley is to me more frightening this time around than any of the attacks of the alien, besides of course the initial eruption (SPOILER) from Caine (John Hurt) whose experience is still the most revolting and disturbing thing in the film.  It didn't take fancy special effects to convey the eerieness of the alien's taking of Caine as its host organism.<br/><br/>    So, yes, in the end, ""Aliens"" is a far more intense and gratifying film, but when it comes to personifying the creation of the alien, and the heartless calculation of those who would use it, this film is chilling.  You won't leave shaking, but it still sticks with you."
"Ronin47","9","0","1","1 November 2003"," Not quite perfect, but very close (***1/2)
","Ridley Scott's 1979 classic is back on the big screen with a few minor changes, just in time for Halloween. <br/><br/>Though it obviously has sci-fi qualities, ""Alien"" is first and foremost a horror film, and it's a grim and relentless one. The giant ship Nostromo that it takes place on plays the role of a haunted house and the Alien is like the killer in a slasher film, picking off members of the cast one by one. <br/><br/>However, its simplicity is exactly what gives it the raw charge it's always had. Like John Carpenter's great, underrated remake of ""The Thing"" that came out 3 years later, it gives us a cast of likable, middle-aged working stiffs, puts them in contact with a hostile alien presence, and coldly observes as they scramble for their lives, resulting in nearly unbearable and uniquely realistic suspense. <br/><br/>This was the first time I'd ever seen ""Alien"" on the big screen (I was 1 year-old when it came out), and I really enjoyed it. Some of the special effects look a little cheesy now, but most of them still look great.<br/><br/>
As for the monsters, the egg-laying spider creature is still one of the ickiest in movie history, and the H.R. Giger designed mother Alien is a vicious, slimy beast that is not quite like any other.<br/><br/>
The cast is great too, especially Sigourney Weaver as Ripley (of course), Tom Skeritt as the ship's studly captain (he'll survive a long time, right?), and Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dead Stanton, who are immensely enjoyable as two constantly grumbling mechanics. <br/><br/>""Alien"" is a great movie, but there a few slow patches and I've always felt that it takes a little too long to really start kicking ass. Those are very minor flaws, though, and are all that's keeping it from my 4-star rating.<br/><br/>
As good as ""Alien"" is, it would get dwarfed (in my opinion and many other peoples') by its 1986 sequel, James Cameron's astoundingly intense ""Aliens"", a brilliant action/sci-fi/horror film that is so good it's renowned as a masterpiece in all three of those genres. Compared to that movie, ""Alien"" looks downright humble. But it gets to job done, and done good."

","Having just watched this film, for the first time in its entirety, I am following yesterday's review for the sequel. Somehow I have managed to miss this movie before, even though it is 24 years old (Couldn't they have waited until 2004 for the 'traditional' anniversary release?) I didn't think I would be writing this review as I said I only would do so if it was better than 'Aliens'. Well, for those who watched it on its initial release, I expect this is still held in higher regard. But, for me, 24 years later, 'Aliens' still has the edge. They are really quite different movies, in that the sequel, as sequels generally tend to do, goes for all-out action, but whereas most follow-ups pale in comparison to the original, 'Aliens' actually goes one better, and does not lose sight of the importance of tension, as well as the action. 'Alien' is a much slower film, filled with tense creepy moments, and less mayhem. There are, after all, fewer crew members to dispose of here. I was surprised that it didn't really look dated, except when you see how young the cast look. The weakest 70s giveaway is the occasionally inappropriate music. Other than that, it is still very 'contemporary' in its feel. Sigourney Weaver looks terrific and gradually makes her presence felt as the tension mounts. I reckon I have watched the first half before, but the final hour was unfamiliar to me. It is said that all great thrillers, if the Alien films can be placed in that category as well as horror and sci-fi, work better if the tension outweighs the graphic depiction of events. On this level, 'Alien' is great, but 'Aliens' was as tense, if not more so, and a terrif action movie to boot. So, whereas I gave 'Aliens' 9 out of 10, I award 8 out of 10 to the original."

I'm genuinely interested.<br/><br/>Regarding your other issues, I agree that the presence of ""gravity"" on the ship is indeed a bit of a stretch, but I think that you would have been just as upset if there had been some long discourse on how they achieve this at that point in the future.

In fact, when the movie was over, the lights came up in the theater and nobody moved or said anything.  That's how powerful this movie was back in 1979. As noted in many other comments, this is a well constructed film that has the ability to keep drawing you in when, in the back of your mind, you're saying ""I don't want to go there!"" It's a testament to the quality of this film that my parents (who were in their fifties at the time and had never seen anything remotely like this in the movies in their entire lives) sat through the whole thing on HBO.<br/><br/>No real need to go over the story because, by now, almost everyone has a rough idea of what the ""Alien"" films are all about. I will say that there was a direct predecessor done in the 50's.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the name. I rented it years after seeing ""Alien"" and was struck at how closely it resembled the more modern film and how some scenes were pretty scary for the time.  <br/><br/>Anyway, I recommend this film.

The changes are subtle and not major in the least. For example, there is less of ""mother"" the semi-clone of ""HAL"" from 2001 A Space Odyssey. This is a good idea as computer technology in 1979, the original release date, was. ..well, it wasn't. And, of course, CGI wasn't an option for the special effects, either.<br/><br/>The result is, what seems to me, a much ""tighter"" movie that flows better than the original. The actors, action, soundtrack, and visuals are absolutely stunning, and seeing this movie on the big screen had a tremendous impact on myself and my fellow theatre-goers.<br/><br/>

","I don't think people really remember how groundbreaking this film really was. As both a horror and a science fiction movie, it set an all new standard. While Star Wars really gets the credit for taking science fiction to the next level, let's be honest - it's a kid's movie and it feels like a kid's movie. The special effects were...hell, are...great. But it's still sterile. It's Saturday afternoon matinee. It's laser beams and guys in rubber suits. Alien took science fiction and made it feel like science fact. Everything about the movie screamed real...and that upset a lot of people.<br/><br/>
1. The premise - this wasn't space jockeys or princesses or even astronauts ""exploring space"". This was ""space as resource"" - humans taking advantage of other planets for mining ore. Boring, dirty, and a nice reality check for science fiction.<br/><br/>2. The crew - one-dimmensional and unlikeable? You bet. No stereotypes here at all - no dashing captains, no tough guys, no blonde beauties. These were working class folks - blue collar truckers. Everything about the dialogue and behavior rings completely true. They don't really give a s*** about each other, they panic...they just want to go home, get some decent food, and collect their shares.<br/><br/>3. The creature - holy s***, are you kidding me? Does anyone remember how much this movie freaked people out? People could not...and still can't...deal with it. It was just the most horrific thing anyone had ever seen. It took ""shocking"" to a whole new place. Everything about it was just so disgustingly real - from the grime and goop to the slime and blood - no one had ever seen anything like. It was your worst nightmare...only worse. The thing didn't attach itself to his arm or his back or his neck - the bulbous, spider-like, slimy, disgusting thing attached itself to HIS FACE. And then, after LAYING AN EGG INSIDE HIM, the new creature came EXPLODING OUT OF HIS CHEST. Take a step back for a minute. Time and other movies have dulled the experience a bit...but can you imagine seeing this for the first time when the only horror and sci-fi you'd ever seen was 2001 and Psycho? And it all rang true, like the Discover channel's version of ""When Aliens Attack""...the kind of disgustingly messy and painful reproduction that only nature could come up with.<br/><br/>4. The robot - C3-PO...puh-lease. This movie is messy and disgusting, just like real life. No wires and circuit boxes. You want an android that looks and acts human, then you're going to have to think out of the box. An android like that is gonna be messy and gross inside...it's gonna be filled with liquid and fuel and god knows what else. When this android flips it's wig, his head ain't gonna disconnect for Chewbacca to screw it back on. You're gonna need a flamethrower to clean the mess up. Again, reality creeps its way into science fiction in a way no one had ever even thought of before.<br/><br/>5. The pace - sorry, no laser fights. This movie, like the best horror movies (the Shining and Halloween), builds slowly. It's about atmosphere...and this films has it in spades. You know something bad is going to happen, but you don't know what. Instead, you just watch the gorgeous sets and backdrops as the tension builds. And when it's time for dinner, the timer goes off and all hell breaks lose...in a way you never imagined.<br/><br/>6. The dialogue - ""Hey man, the food ain't that bad"", Parker jokes as Kane begins choking. That sums up the dialogue - real. The characters may have been unlikable, but they were real. Almost too real. There are parts of the film, as the characters mumble and talk over one another, that almost have a documentary feel to it.<br/><br/>Nearly 25 years later, this is one of the most brilliant, groundbreaking, and genuinely horrific and beautiful films ever made. A masterpiece."

Let me start with Kane, whom we see first rising from his cryogenic tube like a vampire from a coffin. Man, you're going to have a BAD day. John Hurt (Rob Roy) acted capably in this film; sadly there isn't much for his character to do except die horribly. Kane is the first driver though, and all the crew's sorrows begin with him: a man whose curiosity costs more than just his life. Isn't he lucky to have friends like Lambert, a character apprehensive from the start, and Dallas? Veronica Cartwright (The Birds, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Witches of Eastwick) is flawless in her part, as no one else can seem so realistically terrified. Tom Skerritt does fine as Dallas also, although I've only seen him in this movie. They risk their lives rushing Kane back to the infirmary, carrying him like a corpse, which is fitting since he is already dead. Lambert and Dallas don't know that yet. Their hope is blind.

But did you know that Ridley Scott wanted a different ending, where the alien bites off Ripley's head and then sends a message to earth in her voice? (See ""trivia"".) How could such a fine director come up with an idea like that? Aside from being an unhappy ending, a far better reason to reject that idea is that it makes no logical sense whatsoever. I know it's an alien and it's abilities would be shrouded in mystery, but still, that would've been just too hard to swollow. Anyway, this is going to be re-released on Halloween, 2003, with footage that was cut from the original version, so it'll be interesting to check out."

","I have this little theory... that talented filmmakers often do their best work (notice I said talented?) with their first couple of features.  If the talent shows any promise, the film gets noticed, makes money, wins a few awards.  When you've got nothing left to prove, you lose that hunger that drives you for success, the hunger that only lets you get 3 hours of sleep each day, the hunger that gives you that attention to detail over every little thing.  ""Alien"" is truly the work of an artist obsessing over every little detail and nuance.  The set design, cinematography (Adrian Biddle, one of the great british cameramen), special effects and visual effects (considering it was the late '70s) are all top notch.<br/><br/>Scott, who ironically would come to be known in the 80's for his cleverness with chiascuro (thanks to such insipid tripe as ""Legend"" and ""Someone to Watch Over Me""), willingly settled into his director-for-hire mode that he remained in until breaking out with ""Gladiator"", truly a stunningly epic film, despite the limitations of the screenplay which was basically a revenge or die story.<br/><br/>""Alien"" takes it time, long and leisurely, setting up the character development, the arc of the plot, and slowly turns up the intensity to the scary climax.  The film has aged somewhat, due in no small part to Cameron's sequel ""Aliens"", which owes more to Heinleins novel ""Starship Troopers"" than it does to Scott's ""Alien"".  <br/><br/>This film has haunted my imagination since I first saw this film when I was 13 years old... The cinematic themes of dark betrayal, such as the corporation of the film essentially using the crew of the Nostromo as a ""mule"" for the Alien, were still new to me.  Perhaps I had too much time on my hands, but I often would think about how Ripley said if they had brought the creature on board, then they would all have had to spend time in quarantine upon their return to Earth.  Then, in a dark moment of mabacre creativity, I realized perhaps the company had created the alien through genetic engineering themselves, sent it out to that planet, and then planned to use the Nostromo crewmembers to bring back the Alien species to Earth to use as a form of biological warfare.  It kind of puts a neat twist on the film, since they never did explain where exactly that crashed spaceship (The ""space jockey"" creature) came from."

","""Alien"" was the first (and best) of the four films released to date starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley the hard assed alien fighter.<br/><br/> Briefly the story centers on a space freighter of the future on its way back to earth towing its cargo of rare minerals and staffed by a crew of seven. When we meet them, they are just awakening from a deep sleep and think that they are nearing earth. However, the on board computer (called ""Mother"") has awakened them for a different reason. An apparent distress signal is coming from an unknown source on an unknown planet. When they investigate they discover a bed of egg like growths in an underground cave. One of the ""eggs"" hatches and a creature attaches itself to the face of crewman Kane (John Hurt). After a short time Kane appears to recover but then a creature suddenly emerges from his chest. The creature grows into a monster and begins to stalk the crew until.....<br/><br/> Director Ridley Scott gives us what amounts to a haunted house in outer space horror story. We just barely get a glimpse of the creature as it attacks. The crew moves about long, dark and damp cavernous passageways from where the creature could emerge at any moment. Scott creates an atmosphere of claustrophobia as the crew is trapped where in space..no one can hear you scream. He also utilizes Ripley's cat, Jones to great effect.<br/><br/> The cast is first rate. In addition to Weaver as Ripley and John Hurt as Kane, there is Tom Skerritt as Dallas the commander of the ship, Veronica Cartright as Lambert, Yahfet Kotto as Parker, Harry Dean Stanton as Brett and Ian Holm as Ash the Science officer who has secrets of his own. All turn in excellent performances as Ridley Scott keeps the suspense building.<br/><br/> For a perceived horror picture there is surprisingly little on screen violence involving the creature, as this is largely left to the imagination of the viewer. Two scenes involving the Ash and Kane characters are the exception.<br/><br/> An excellent well directed sci-fi horror film."

","Alien is easily the greatest sci-fi horror movie. Weaving strong themes of suspense, fear, and the omnipresent darkness, Ridley Scott has created a masterpiece. The cinematography is profound, the acting is strong without being cheesy, the special effects are surprisingly good, and the alien itself is amazing. H R Giger has been influenced by an oceanic lifeform called the Phronima, and modelled the beast on this tiny organism, to great effect. The drool factor, while not fully controlled in this one, is still gross in a cool way, and there's so much fun in watching the behind the scenes footage. I highly recommend this for serious collections."
"NoArrow","Null","0","1","28 July 2003"," Good, but not as good as the sequel...
","...for most cases I have trouble saying that the sequel is better than the original because the original is the reason that the sequel was made, but ""Alien"" just isn't as suspenseful as ""Aliens"".  The story focuses on Lt. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and the crew of her ship, the Nostromo, battling an unusual alien which is lost on board.  The rest of the crew consists of captain Dallas (Tom Skerrit), sinister scientist Ash (Ian Holm), Kane (John Hurt), Parker (Yaphet Kotto), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton).<br/><br/>The main problem with ""Alien"" is that there are just too few characters to create an intense, hostile atmosphere - like the sequel.  Dallas is a conceited annoying hack and Ripley is a whiner.  Also, Kane is killed off too early and Lambert and Brett are just...boring.  Although, Holm plays Ash wonderfully, and same goes for Kotto as the careless Parker.<br/><br/>Of course, I would have to consider that the film was made in 1979, and from a technical aspect, it's perfect.  The alien costume looks incredibly realistic - even better than some of the CGI we see in movies today.  And there are some suspenseful scenes, including Dallas' searching for the alien in an air duct and Ripley's climactic battle with the alien.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, ""Alien"" doesn't disappoint, but it lacks in hard suspense, 8/10."
"jpg-8","9","0","1","18 July 2003"," Still very scary. A brilliant combination of sc-fi and horror
","A good way to know if a movie is great, it's to see how it passes the test of time. ""Alien"" does that. It's a classic. Even by today's standards, it's a really frightening movie.<br/><br/>The main reason why it's so suspenseful is that you almost never see the monster. You have glimpses, but that's it. The ending in the rescue ship shows a little more of it, but not much. Monsters on screen are always more scary when you don't see them. This one is all the more impressive because H.R. Giger did a splendid job with it.<br/><br/>The other thing that makes ""Alien"" beautiful are the sets. The interiors of the ""Nostromo"", the exteriors on LV4-26 (also created by H.R. Giger) : all magnificient. A rich movie is a movie where the camera has plenty to show : it definitely does in ""Alien"".<br/><br/>Jerry Goldsmith's music is also perfect. It doesn't show off at all, it's not overwhelming (like in other Hollywood movies). Instead, it's scaringly efficient. In the beginning of the movie, it's very low, but it helps a lot in creating suspense before the monsters are found.<br/><br/>The acting is also top notch. Sigourney Weaver gives here her breakthrough performance. Ian Holm is chilling as the android Ash, the five other actors are also just fine.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott managed to combine all these elements to create a fantastic atmosphere. My favorite part of ""Alien"" starts when Ripley is alone and triggers the auto-destruct sytem. The alarm going off, ""Mother's"" voice, the steam : all this is memorable.<br/><br/>Last but not least, ""Alien"" is not only a scary monster story, it also has something to say. The attitude of the Weyland-Yutani Company is very interesting. The film talks about perverted capitalism, where human life has no more value. The only thing that matters is to bring the specimen back for study. ""Crew expandable"". True, other sc-fi movies and books contain that theme. Nevertheless, it's a relevant point. It's a relevant today as it was in 1979.<br/><br/>""Alien"" is definitely a must-see (except, maybe, for those who can't stand to be scared by a movie). It combines the best qualities of horror and sc-fi. If this one is my favorite, I do love the three sequels : ""Aliens"" is a scary, war-like but very human film. ""Alien 3"" is dark and beautiful, like a Greek tragedy. ""Alien Resurrection"" is beautifully shot and has an intelligent story."

","Possible Spoilers When this film was release back in 1979 it set new standards for suspence and terror that kick-started a new wave of imitations plus 2 more sequels (I haven't seen Alien Resurection yet) that were just as good but entirely different to this one. In my opinion there are three reasons to the success of this film. 1. The eerie poetry of the first half. This helped established it as a totally different film to the Star Wars space opera type films that were in force back then. Scenes such as the horse-shoe-like spacecraft resting alone on the bleak, primordial landscape with huge dark planets floating in the sky and accompanied by Jerry Goldsmith marvelously creepy score last in memory. 2.The cast. Ridley Scott wisely didn't hire any superstars for the small cast. He instead used a mixture of then-unknowns (Sigourney Weaver) and character actors (Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm)and each one gives a marvellous performance. Instead of fearless stereotypes we get normal people who just want to get home to their families. You can almost feel the characters' fear as they are sucked into a seemingly inescapable cycle of despair and terror. 3. The alien. The alien is one monster that can be called truly terrifying, even if it is just a guy in a suit covered with Jello-O. Scott makes the creature cruel, intelligent and totally inimical to human life. The only weakness in the film is that the script is plagarised from both the classic sci-fi movie 'It, The Terror from beyond Space' and the Italian/Spanish masterpiece 'Planet of Vampires.' But it is a small quibble in a film of fantastic moments of terror."
"Dre64","Null","0","1","31 May 2003"," Truly Groundbreaking.
","ALIEN may or may not be one of the greatest sci-fi films, but, it is unequivocally, the most influential one in the past 25-30 years. Since its release in 1979, there are only a handful of films in the genre that even come close to matching its impact.(and even those films borrow somewhat from the storyline of Ridley Scott's film) Yes, I do admit that it is shy of being an absolute perfect motion picture,(ie. the story drags a bit at the beginning, not a whole lot of time spent on character development)it still succeeds in spite of its few shortcomings. Stylish, atmospheric, gritty, graphic, nightmarish, and sometimes shocking, ALIEN was like no sci-fi/horror film made before. The characters were not the conventional good guy/bad guy portrayals seen in so many other films. They were flawed, vunerable, regular, everyday folk, trying to do their regular, everyday jobs, who were thrown into a terrifying and hellish predicament. So there really wasn't a whole lot of time to delve into how the crew interacted with one another or who was romantically linked with who. The soundtrack complimented perfectly with the dark tone of the film. Mr. Scott was wise enough to know that you don't need loud, jolting music all during the film to frighten your audience. Let the visual scare the h**l out of em'. And man did it ever. Add a great ensemble cast, shake up the audience's expectations of who will save the day, who will make it and who won't,and you have a film that to this day that has few, if any, equals within its genre."

"alainenglish","Null","0","1","23 May 2003"," Strong plot hampered by weak characterisation (spoilers)
","A massive hit spawning three high-grossing sequels, ""Alien"" is now said to be the model for every space-set horror movie.  Unfortunately, the film does not quite deserve such an accolade.  For while it does have an excellent plot and superlative special effects for its time (the film has not dated too much, either), the main characters lack depth, inhibiting our sympathy with them when they're inevitably killed off.<br/><br/>In an unspecified time at some point in the future, the crew of cargo ship Nostromo are in deep sleep on a journey back to Earth.  Woken up half-way there, they are forced to investigate a signal from an uncharted planet, having been told they will lose their wages if they don't.  They discover a derelict spaceship and inadvertantly bring a deadly alien life form back on board their ship....<br/><br/>The basic storyline, by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, is very strong and contains alot of great set-pieces.  The best of all is when crew member Kane (John Hurt) dies in the infamous ""chest-bursting"" scene and the numerous futile attempts by the remaining crew members to track down and kill the monster.<br/><br/>The alien itself is a very impressive design, although perhaps it could have looked a little less humanoid.  The inclusion of several deleted scenes could have helped establish the creature's motivation, psychology and capabilities alot better.  However, fully explaining these is a problem that occurs not just in Alien but in it's sequels as well.<br/><br/>The set-design is gloomy, detailed and claustrophobic and given a sense of lived-in reality.  The alien ship in particular is a fascinating organic design, and it is odd how the sequels have never returned to explore it further.  All of this is well accentuated by some well-orchestrated music that carefully builds an atmosphere of fear and impending doom.<br/><br/>The film is certainly alot slower than most films of it's type today.  The slow careful buildup in the beginning and the quite measured approach to some scenes makes today's horror pictures seem very rushed by comparison. However, this is a flaw when you have a set of characters as mundane as the ones here.<br/><br/>A strength of the sequels to this movie is the distinctiveness of the characterisations, the lack of which is a problem here.  Almost none of the characters fully engage the audience and, with the exception of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and eventually Ash (Ian Holm), no character has any development or agenda at hand.  The problem is not so much with the acting, but with the writing.  Most of the lines in the films are interchangeable between characters.  As a result, the film tends to drag whenever the eponymous alien is not on-screen.<br/><br/>A superb technical achievement, but the weak writing and characterisation would improve in subsequent films."

The visual effects are surpisingly good and remind us that digital tinkering hasn't made that much difference really to good old model-work and process shots.

In this case: horror.<br/><br/>The cast is negligible at best, pathetic at worst.  There is no real character depth, not even for Ripley (James Cameron would get her role kicking into hyperdrive thankfully) and the plot still has its lapses in logic.  My real sympathy goes to Ian Holm, but not his character, since he seems to be the only one who can act beyond screaming like Veronica Cartwright's character and spouting ""Right"" as Harry Dean Stanton does.  Ian also gets the best lines =)<br/><br/>Actually, that can be said for the ALIEN series in a whole.  The bigger the sequel number, the more plot holes there are.  Someone want to explain how the eggs got onboard the Sulaco in ""3"", or cloning Ripley after 200 years in ""Resurrection"".  Exactly, point proved.<br/><br/>The visual and special effects are a grab bag.  They are better than Moonraker, I will admit that, but some scenes are rather lackluster in the flash content.  In many cases, the Adult ALIEN looks like a guy in a suit (they perfected the design for ALIENS in my opinion) and some of the space scenes, particularly at the end, are obviously phony.<br/><br/>The tension is much the same as in ALIENS, we get halfway into the film before things really get rolling.  Fortunately, Mr. Fincher got us going at the outset of ""3"", but then wrecked it by having too many pauses.<br/><br/>All in all, ALIEN is an incredible experience that isn't quite as exciting or enjoyable as ALIENS, but still deserves much respect for the ground it covered. 4 out of 5."

","Alien is one of those movies that will stay with you for a long time because of its scaryness and eerieness as well. The script, story, actors, Directing and Special Effects are excellent. The story is simple as it follows a routine Mothership on its way to earth is piloted toward an Unknown planet with an unknown origin about it. When they land there they discover mysetrious alien beings living down there when a smaller alien (Known as a queen face hugger i believe) attaches himself to a crew member. Later in the film it comes off of him and the ship leaves the planet but, however the Alien begins to take a form of its own by slaining each crew member as it grows bigger. Only Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) can stop it from coming to earth. The baby Alien coming out of Kane's chest is gross but a memorable scene of what fear an Alien could bring. All of these elements in Alien success with only one tiny problem the film kinda drags but it is forgotten. Sigourney Weaver does a great job potraing Lt. Ellen Ripley she would do a wonderful job in the superior sequel Aliens. However this movie is the one that started it so i think its the second best in the series because its the one that depended upon characters and the storyline. Director Ridley Scott directs with a great visual appeal just like on many of his other films and H.R Giger's design really gives it that dark Alien quality to it you can really believe it. I give Alien on a regular scale 4.5/5 and the 10 scale a 9.5/10.

But the Alien, it is one of the corner stones of Sci-fi/Horror mixing. I do like to watch movies like Star Trek, but even looking these side by side is not good idea.

Especially this first, and second Aliens movie is about betrayal and misconduction of superrority of humanrace. These are wider aspects but these are clearly seen in movie. Also i find it more realistic in Sci-fi by the shown sets in so called futuristic technology. In comparison, Star Trek is hole different world of unbelievable tech. bable. AND! in the end, the time when this movie was produced, it is remarkable work to do such quality in 1979.

","to me, this is a film which, other than the haircuts, just doesn't age. The first film of the alien saga is easily the best. Or at least, the scariest. Pitting one alien against a crew of seven is a great set-up for some horrible and gruesome battles. But instead, it takes it further and draws the war out, singling out certain members as they leave the crowd, to face the creature on their own. It takes a good while before the action begins but all the build up it what makes the end result so utterly chilling. As soon as one of the main characters ""releases"" the alien, you know it's only going to get better from there. The sound effects in this movie are the best use of noise ever put on screen. The wind effects, the spaceships, the alien, the computers all have memorable sounds, and the creature design for the alien has become legendary. Undoubtebly one of the scariest films ever made."

It works on many levels: atmosphere, photography, acting, sets, scares, plot twists, story, sound and music are all great. What sets it apart is it's realism.<br/><br/>For starters, there is the mixed bunch of characters; nobody is flawless and they all interact in a believable manner. Then there is the way the crew is split up in staff and support, each disliking and distrusting the other species, with engineers playing little power games to boost their self esteem. Another great concept, and quite new in SF at the time, is how new technology is presented as a matter of fact, and often does not work.<br/><br/>This, together with the way the movie is directed, shot and cut, results in a first part which is simply unique in movie history. From the awakening of the spaceship crew right up to the scene where the alien first rears it's ugly head, these images belong to the best ever created for the big screen.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is not bad, but this is where I usually drift off when the movie is rerun on tv. I try to be back for the final scene on board the escape module, which is also a classic. If the part in between would have been slightly better, this might have been my favorite movie of all time.

","The very beginning of the Alien Saga starts off in 1979 with Ridley Scott's ALIEN.<br/><br/>It's really quite doubtful that the moods in this movie, though often imitated, will ever be effectively duplicated.  I think that the actual mystery of seeing this creature for the first time is quite marvelous.<br/><br/>
At its core, Alien is technically a horror movie - and, though I'm not a fan of the genre, this movie got to me (I now own all three on DVD).  It's stylistic, dark, and unforgiving.<br/><br/>This of course being the first movie in the saga, will be when you're all introduced to the most bad-assed sci-fi heroine of all time.  Lt. Ellen Ripley, though not a soldier or warrior, is more assertive and tough than you might think that average warrant officer might be... and you will see her endless battle throughout Alien, Aliens(1986), and Alien 3(1992) - I don't care what they tell you - they did NOT make a 4th one.

","In theaters everyone can hear you scream!<br/><br/>Let's cut the crap and admit the first of the Alien series is still the best. While Cameron and Fincher are worthy successors, Scott joined forces with the visionary Swiss surrealist Giger to create a stunning horror-sf flick that still stands today. Just watch it again and it's really extraordinary to find out it's a film from 1979 (just compare it to other 70's films and you know what we're talking about). Cameron just made a good roller coaster, but gone was the suggestive power that made the first one such a terrific thrill. And Fincher lost his way due to horrible production conditions (he wanted to jump from tunnel to tunnel to create an overall vision, but the studio wouldn't let him). Number 4 in the series is just a plain comic, period.<br/><br/>Isn't it great that in Scott's original you only see the Alien for a couple of minutes? He used the same method to scare the audience Jacques Tourneur used in the original Cat People: sound. The Alien literally hisses its way through the film. Only on certain designated moments in the film, Scott lets it all go, which makes the horror even more convincing (the chestbuster scene!). All in all, Alien is pure art, hence the success of Giger's design and the impact it still has on Alien fans worldwide. Hope Scott will make the fifth, maybe he could elaborate on the Alien planet.

First of all it wasnt exaggerated or blown into a scream fest.  It was more scary because there was silence.  It was in space, and they had no possible way for protection other than to face it or detonate the entire mission. The lifecycle of this Alien which was truly original and fascinating brought a lot suspense as well.  The egg, too the facehugger to the chestburster to the ALIEN, shows a very elaborate growth to make such a beautiful creature.  H.R. Giger is an awesome artist, and being a huge fan of his work, I loved his set design as well as his ALIEN.  The absence of eyes in the ALIEN makes it all the more terrifying.

"OptikMatrix","Null","0","1","30 November 2002"," A terrifying masterpiece
","The 1970's were not very good for sci-fi films.  It was a decade littered with rehashed plots, cheap futuristic visions, and way too many ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" rip-offs.  Sure, a few films stood out from the rest (Star Wars and A Clockwork Orange among them), but the 70's were generically disappointing for science fiction cinema.  That is, until 1979 came along... In 1979, people were still reeling from the incredible genius of Star Wars. Star Wars was the ultimate intergalactic fantasy, complete with knights, a princess, a hero, and an evil empire.  George Lucas made the final frontier fun, until Ridley Scott came along and made the universe a place of fear and unimaginable horror with Alien. Alien is nothing short of amazing.  It's dark climate and extremely realistic feel make it one of the best movies of our time.  By now everyone knows the plot; the crew of the mining vessel Nostromo land on LV-426 to investigate an SOS.  While on the planet one of the crew members picks up an alien organism who grows and changes and picks off the crew one by one. It's a really simple story obviously (it couldn't have taken Dan O'Bannon more than 2 minutes to come up with the concept) but it develops at a great pace and is executed with an incredible eye for detail. The protaganists aren't your typical ""cowboys in space"" characters.  They are normal, tough, gritty people who want to go in, get the job done, get payed, and get back home.  They have no interest in boldly going where no man has gone before or fighting for truth, justice, or the American way. For them, work is hell.  They are like the everyday person.  So when the stealthy and deadly alien threat comes aboard the ship, they deal with it like any one of us would deal with it, and it is completely believable. The Nostromo ship itself also signaled a change in the sci-fi standard misconception that the future will be a place of perpetual sanitation. The Nostromo is dirty, grimy, and very realistic space ship that has spawned countless look-alikes over the years. A climate of fear is created when the Nostromo crew encounter the ultimate predator...the alien creature.  The alien is the stuff of nightmares; a black, lumbering, quick and seemingly indestructible monster that kills with raw efficiency and without mercy.  Throughout the film we are only shown bits and pieces of the alien, keeping up our interest level while at the same time scaring us out of our wits.  When you finally do see the creature in full, it's clearly one of the most original and horrific screen monsters ever. Alien is a fantastic film that revolutionized the sci-fi genre.  The scare factor fades after repeated viewings, but the movie's stylistic and unique appeal never seem to go away.  The next film in the series, Aliens (directed by James Cameron of The Terminator) continues the Alien story but abandons the claustrophobic horror of the first in favor of non-stop, pulse-pounding action. Any fan of horror or sci-fi should see Alien.  It's a great film with few flaws that will surely have you thinking twice about walking down a dark hallway."

The basis is a science fiction story, yet here the plot is much more phylosofic and scince fiction is only a frame coming to emphasize the main ideas which are universal, such as : Human existanse and its price,the essence  of difference between human and organic,which is not only the intellect (see the sciene of Ash's ""death"").<br/><br/>Every time Ridley Scott deals with such ideas (see Blade Runner) the output is overwhelming.

","The first time I viewed this film, I have to admit, I was disappointed in both Scott and Goldsmith. Through circumstance, I had watched Aliens and Alien3 without ever seeing the original, and when I finally did it came as a great shock. But after viewing the film a second time, and especially after viewing the DVD's commentary, the very things that disappointed me about the film, Alien, are the very things that I now feel make it superior to any of its sequels.<br/><br/>Alien is so incredibly subtle and raw. The all out war aspect of Cameran's sequel fanfared with Horner's fantastic score--not here. The fight and pacing of Alien 3 is not here either. What is here? A very realistic, and a very stylish approach to a mysterious beacon where death awaits the crew, accompanied by Jerry Goldsmith's very original and primal score. Once I got over the realization that this is not an action film, then I looked into the subtle nature and viewed a horror film that actually contained depth.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's raw vision of a dark future in space exploration certainly grounds the film in a sense of reality. The dark almost industrial feel of the Nostromo--guess what? It is an industrial ship, probably not all of it is kept up to code? Sound familiar? Like, oh, most things in this world's society? No the future isn't all florescent lights, and hospital-clean ships like Star Trek. This is what *our* future probably will look like.<br/><br/>Likewise, the characters hold an amazing amount of realism compared to<br/><br/>95% of the horror films out there. Their decisions, their logic, their personalities, and the steps they take actually makes sense and the audience would probably go along with it if we didn't know the premise of the film. It's always refreshing to come across characters smart enough to try something intelligent like fighting the big bad monster with reasonable firepower and/or getting away from it.<br/><br/>HR Gieger's visions come across brilliantly, blended with Scott's style and Goldsmith's score--tis a formula for success. But Alien succeeds not because of action, not because of fancy sets and effects. Alien works because it's about realistic characters on a realistic ship which becomes claustrophobic once the Alien is unleashed. Scott is a director who relies on what is unseen, and makes damn good use of the little that is actually seen. The movie Alien is about suspense, which Scott and his team masterfully craft out in the middle of space where no one can hear you scream.<br/><br/>Alien is considered classic Sci-fi horror because the team understands the concept of suspense, and like Ridley Scott said the only point is pure Terror. I've seen the film several times now, and every time I still find myself at the edge of my seat wrapped up in the moment as the Nostromo crew explores those dark corridors regardless of having knowledge of every jump and outcome. I still feel the terror with every viewing. This isn't cheap thrills, this is genuine suspense that few directors can attain."

","It's a scholarly view that there are a very finite number of basic stories. All we do is tweak the recipes and tell the same stories over and over again. Rather than allow it do depress you, allow yourself to appreciate how great a role execution plays in this process, and how the most generic of storytelling formulas can be the basis for something completely unprecedented.<br/><br/>Alien is, at heart, a haunted house in space, mixed with Ten Little Indians. On paper it never tries to rise above that, and you could see in its earliest stages what a clever little sci-fi horror film it would have led to (and if you care to see that version, look no further than Italian genre entry Planet of the Vampires). But bring some visionary talent to the table and you get to see alchemy at work.<br/><br/>Picking up the pieces from Jodorowsky's aborted Dune, director Ridley Scott, despite only one feature to his credit to date, had a strong hand: a powerful visual sense, and the help of artists as diverse as visionary French illustrator Jean Giraud (Moebius, for fans) and Swiss conjurer of nightmares Hans Ruedi Giger. With such a creative trio, visually, this is as safe a bet as you could find. But visual thrills alone do not make a film: every story has to do, first and foremost, with people.<br/><br/>Credit the writers of the original script for a solid blueprint if you must but then tell yourself that first, Scott's tireless storyboarding of the whole film convinced the studio to double his meager budget, and second, for a director seldom credited with his work with actors, he pulled a fantastic casting coup: veteran hands for the most part, happy to mostly improvise the naturalistic banter of the ship's doomed crew, anchoring this tale and making it all the more horrific for it. The masterstroke, especially in retrospect as Alien went from standalone classic to cinematic saga, was the choice of Sigourney Weaver as Ripley.<br/><br/>Decades later, and Alien is a masterclass of both horror and science-fiction. it's that slow, agonizing build-up that enhances the effectiveness of the horror once unleashed. it's the forbidding look, and how everything is both terrifying and beautiful at the same time, from the cavernous ship itself to the titular monster, cinema's greatest without a doubt. It's in the frightful subconscious analogies from violent impregnation to rape, to the cruel meld of machine and organic that characterizes the alien and its origins. It's in the deaths themselves, each one an unforgettable, nightmare-inducing experience, none more-so that the captain's claustrophobic tunnel hunt.<br/><br/>You'll hear people rave about sequel Aliens and how much better it is. More action- packed, sure. More epic and more likable perhaps, but better? No. Not in a million years, and given the high quality of that classic film, it says a lot about the original.<br/><br/>This one will change you forever."

","(spoilers) ALIEN is one of the scariest sci-fi movies ever made, not to mention probably the best one ever made. What made it so scary was that nobody had ever seen anything like it before, and therefore nobody knew what to expect back in 1979. Nowadays, with such cheap horror like Urban Legends, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, Sleepy Hollow, Jason X, and all the rest, where things jump out at you and kill you at every turn, the fright level of ALIEN might not be as high as it was 23 years ago, but it still remains a solid thriller.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's idea for ALIEN was amazing, and it has a great story. A cargo ship, returning from a long space voyage, is stopped near a planet where some sort of distress signal is coming from, and they go down to investigate. There, they find an alien lifeform and unwisely bring it aboard. There, after it hatches out of a crew member's stomach, it goes on a killing rampage, slaying every one of the crew members until but one is left. That sets the stage for the film's most unbelievable moments, leading to the final destruction of the Alien.<br/><br/>Another thing about ALIEN is that with most thrillers where people die, you usually have some sort of hero that is brave and defends other people's lives as well as their own. They do that in JAWS, THE BIRDS, THE MUMMY, and even in most teen slasher movies. ALIEN doesn't have any heroes. It doesn't have any brave-hearted, clean-souled people. The crew is full of selfish, money-hungry brats that are all suddenly thrown into a deadly adventure together. The only reason that the characters in ALIEN are out there is for money. Usually wealthy people don't have many hero qualities. The closest character to being a hero is Captain Dallas (who was played brilliantly by Tom Skerritt), who decides to face the Alien head-to-head and not risk anybody else. Other than him, there aren't any people worthy of being heroes or heroines.<br/><br/>I have to say that Ridley Scott's ALIEN is the best sci-fi movie ever made, and that it deserves every true thriller movie fan's highest recommendations."
"Cocephus","Null","0","1","28 October 2002"," The Standard for all Sci-Fi afterwards
","I originally saw Alien only a few years ago, after I had seen special-effects laden knockoffs like ""Starship Troopers"" and even the last two films of the Alien franchise, and I was blown away. Ridley Scott's bleak characterization of corporate-controlled space travel strips away all the romantic, swashbuckling ideals that ""Star Wars"" had laid down only a few years earlier, and H.R. Geiger's horrific set and creature design created a terrifying new vision for moviegoers. To say that the movie starts off slow is an understatement: Scott drags out his film for the first hour or so, giving us little to sink our teeth into and emphasizing again and again the concept of ""space truckers"" rather than ""space explorers"". The crew dresses casually and follows no set protocol: we see that these are not zealous scientists, but real people trying to make a buck and get back to their families. However, when the crew is enticed by a tidy explorer's payment to examine a strange distress call, the film picks up into an eerie, gut-wrenching exploration of a derelict spacecraft carrying very hazardous cargo.<br/><br/>*** SPOILER'S WARNING*** Of course, the true turnaround event of the film is John Hurt's classic ""chestbursting"" scene. Legend has it that the cast of the film had no idea what was going to happen, as Scott wanted all of their reactions to be authentic, and they are nothing if not that. The race of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley against both time and the creature at the end of the movie keeps the viewer absolutely glued to the screen, and just when we thought it was safe to go back in the airlock, we're given a skillfully maneuvered twist ending that directors like M. Night Shyamalan are still using for last-minute scares. The inclusion of Weaver as the heroine in a movie like this was a slap in the face to both sci-fi and horror traditions. As is evident with Carrie Fisher in ""Star Wars"" and Shelly Duvall in ""The Shining"", damsels in distress were the moviemaking rage when ""Alien"" was released; we were provided instead with a cool, collective leading lady who used every instrument at her disposal to save herself and, of course, her cat. While  ""Aliens"" was a fantastic, although very different, sequel, the remaining films in the franchise have been disappointing at best (God-awful at worst). The original, though, set a standard for sci-fi horror, and film in general, that is still looked up to today."

Boy - I was wrong and I was totally scared out of my brain by this movie.<br/><br/>Alien is an absolute classic.  The plot is simple enough and I found that it tended not to focus on all of the characters (to gain sympathy for them). Because the Alien is so terrifying and horrific, you find that it doesn't need to do this ...<br/><br/>Another brilliant masterstroke of this movie is the heroine - Ripley.  I find it great that there is a female hero of this film - it makes it a lot scarier and adds a sense of vulnerability.<br/><br/>The actual design / special effects of the Alien is also quite brilliant.<br/><br/>I find that this is the best movie of the 'Alien"" series (even over the sequel - Aliens). This movie could be one of the best movies of all time. 10 out of 10"

The Alien itself was good, we don't see too much of it which is probably a good thing. I can't say *POSSIBLE SPOILER* I was overly impressed by the look of the alien as a baby in the famous chest-bursting scene. The face-attacher alien was very well done. The spaceship looked quite impressive for it's time, and the general look of the film hasn't dated too much.<br/><br/>I think that the director should have left the 'cocoon sequence' in the film, that was a bit creepy.

"BillyBC","Null","0","1","18 September 2002"," (*****) -- The first (and only?) sci-fi/haunted house/slasher
","(Five out of five stars) Think about it:  Take away the outer space setting and the fact that the killer is a wicked alien monster, and, basically, you have your classic people-locked-in-a-house-with-a-murderer body count slasher flick.  No, really.  Watch it again, and you'll agree that this is like an expertly directed haunted house/slasher film in space, with the huge mother ship and all of its clunky chambers and winding, labyrinthian corridors substituting for the old, dark haunted house.  In fact, I think this film stands alone (with Carpenter's remake of ""The Thing"" and Cronenberg's remake of ""The Fly"" not far behind) as one of the best horror movies AND science fiction films of all time -- quite an accomplishment.  The insectile, H. R. Giger-created alien is one of the most frightening and evil-looking creations of its kind, with rows and rows of razor-sharp teeth and jaws inside of jaws -- this thing is nasty.  As Ripley, the ultimate, kick-butt, action-movie heroine, Sigourney Weaver heads a great cast (Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Ian Holm as the eerily detached medical officer who is not all that he seems, Yaphet Kotto, Harry Dean Stanton and Veronica Cartwright).  This also has one of the best poster tag lines ever:  In space, no one can hear you scream.<br/><br/>HIGHLIGHT:  Geez, take your pick.  Of course, there's the hugely famous chest-bursting scene, in which the egg that was implanted in John Hurt's stomach by that spidery, face-clinging thing doesn't quite agree with him; or there's the other famous, claustrophobic scene with Skerrit, armed with a flashlight and a heat sensor, chasing and then being chased by the alien through dark, endless ventilation shafts; and you can't forget Ripley's frightening final encounter with the alien after she thinks she's safe and sound in her escape pod (doesn't anyone know they're never safe and sound in these kinds of movies?); and the list goes on and on. ..."

","In the future, all ""haunted house"" movies ought to take place on intergalactic spaceships. Well, not really, but you have to admit the concept works - at least when the movie you're talking about is Alien. (Or maybe the most recent Friday the 13th flick, but I digress.)<br/><br/>Long story short, the crew towing a mining freighter (the Nostromo) back home is awakened from hibernation to investigate a distress signal sent from a nearby planet. Upon landing, the ship that presumably sent the signal is found to be lifeless and covered with an odd substance. Kane, the crew member volunteering to check out the lower hull of the dead ship, finds what appear to be eggs and is attacked by an odd alien being. Upon returning him to the ship for medical treatment - that is, getting the alien off his face - the crew wonders what fate might be in store for Kane and themselves. Luckily, the facehugger eventually detaches itself and dies, leaving Kane to wake up and rejoin his mates. And it's at just about that point that all hell breaks loose on the Nostromo...<br/><br/>Without giving too much more away, I should make one thing clear. Alien is not a kind, gentle movie about friendly creatures. The alien in Alien pretty much wants to kill you and everything you love. It appears to have minimal compassion for any living thing, least of all humans - which are, probably correctly, viewed as a threat.<br/><br/>And the alien isn't even the most important part of the movie. What is more intriguing is director Ridley Scott's conception of future gender relations. Aboard the Nostromo, ""male"" is the dominant theme for both sexes - after all, the uniform (shirt, pants, optional jacket or hat) is pretty much the same either way. Females, for the most part, are forced to think and act in the same way as males - Ripley's tough demeanor, especially in the first half of the film, is the best example of this ideal. Lambert represents a more traditional female ethos, but her fate shows that such a forgiving attitude will not be advantageous in the future.<br/><br/>And in that vein, there's one more interesting way to look at the film. The ship - nicknamed ""Mother"" by her crew - effectively serves as a technological counter to the entirely natural alien incubator on the ""dead"" ship. Both are adept at keeping their living cargo safe, and both are surprisingly mechanical in the way they do so. Obviously, this is to be expected from Mother (who is a digital entity, after all) but is interesting coming from a natural life form. But when one thinks about it, an evolution into which a creature exists only to feed and reproduce is maybe inevitable in the end.<br/><br/>Now, to rate the film. Alien is technically beautiful, both from a directorial-cinematic point of view and in a design sense. To be specific, great acting and camerawork allied to truly lifelike sets make you feel as if you're a crew member. Not to mention scaring the living daylights out of you at times. It's a true classic, both for the way in which it tackles the subject of interstellar life forms and for the fact that it's simply a brilliant piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Rating: 3.5 out of 4 stars (thus, a 7-star IMDb rating)"

"rabick","Null","0","1","26 July 2002"," The most realistic film I have ever seen.
","I love this movie.  I have seen ALIEN at least 35 or 40 times.  I've read most of the comments on IMDB and don't disagree with any of the positive reviews.  I do, however, disagree with why people seem to think this is such a great film.  I too at one time wandered why I found ALIEN to be so fascinating.  Let me explain.<br/><br/>Realism, realism, realism.  This movie takes an extremely unrealistic, over the top, and unbelievable story and makes it seem reasonable.  All the actors, unlike the acting in so many bad films, treat the storyline and movie events with such realism, it's stunning.  Unlike the film 2001, which I truly like, the spaceship in ALIEN is truly realistic.  In 2001 the spaceship is perfectly clean, and made for planetary research.  In ALIEN, the ship is a cargo mining ship; somewhat dirty and with a lived in look. No matter what happens in ALIEN, whether it be an acid for blood man-eating space bug or a robot programmed to kill all human crewmembers; or a distress call from a planet with no indigenous life; the actors treat the events with perfect reality; the same way you and I are forced to do through every waking moment of our lives.  This is why people say they have watched the film many times, know what is going to happen next, and still jump out of their chairs at certain scenes.  It's the fact that Ridley Scott, as well as all the people involved in creating this masterpiece, have pulled off the most difficult task in quality film making; Realism.  The kind of realism, so intense, you can't move your eyes from the screen.  This movie could have been about anything, and I truly believe that people would find it just as good.  What people are enjoying so much are Directing and Acting coming together to form something never created before; realism so realistic, it's about an alien life, space travel and androids, and yet completely believable.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, I have seen this film many times.  Without question, more than any other film excluding TAXI Driver.  Although I find 25 or 30 films to be true masterpieces for probably 8 or 9 different reasons; ALIEN contains some type of aura, I call it realism but I am not 100% sure; I find ALIEN to be the most interesting type of entertainment that I have ever been privileged to experience.  Thank God for DVD's; I'm going to watch this film again; right now.  Too excellent to be rated by someone like me; I just don't contain enough brainpower."

I don't even know where to begin. The usually fine Yaphet Kotto, star of 1976 classic ""Monkey Hustle"" gets about 10 lines in this movie but Ian Holmes, minor player in such snoozefests as Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" and gross-out artsy sex comedy ""Naked Lunch"" gets to play (SPOILER>>>) an insane robot!  I think Yaphet Kotto would have made a much better homicidal automaton, but hey, they didn't ask me to direct (I  was only 12 years old.)  And Sigourney Weaver, who was good enough to win a Supporting Actress Oscar in the cult classic ""Working Girl"" has little to do in this borestravaganza other than cowering at the sight of a cheaply made plastic alien monster puppet.<br/><br/>This movie combines two of the worst movies ever made, ""Jaws"" and ""2001: a Space Odyssey"" into a mix that is somehow worse than both of those movies put together.  A laughable rubber monster (""Jaws""), on a spaceship run by an evil computer (""2001"").  Many of the scenes in ""Alien"" seemed to be filmed with a camera that was handheld by an epileptic kid with attention deficit disorder.  I know the tripod was invented before 1979, so I 'm not sure why the director does this.  Maybe he was trying to be ""artistic.""  Also, much of the action involving the Alien takes place in near-darkness using quick cut editing and strobe lights.  If the special effects people had made a monster that was really scary, they would have used decent lighting and kept the monster on screen for a few minutes so you could look at it.  But then again, if they had any imagination, they might have used a color other than ""brownish-grey"" for the set design.  I mean, come on, a spaceship should be made out of gleaming metal and plexiglass.  The Nostromo interior looks like the boiler room in an underfunded inner-city junior high school.  And the exterior looks like a Battlestar Galactica model put together by that epileptic cameraman.<br/><br/>Dull ""action"", lousy set design and comedic special effects all add up to two stars out of 10 for ""Alien."""

Geiger's biomechanical demon had so many details into its habitat and reproduction process, it seemed like the acid-bleeding monster was actually alive and breathing. <br/><br/>The story has space truckers Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, and others investigating an unidentified spacecraft (big mistake!). Hurt is attacked by something parasitic and unearthly from one of thousands of eggs incubating on the ship. The thing, which attaches itself to his face is finally peeled off and terminated. But Hurt is in a coma. Will he live? Sure! He comes out of it later and seems fine to everyone, until of course his stomach explodes unexpectedly and some alien fetus flies out and runs away. Pretty soon the crew is playing a deadly game of hide and seek with the later full-grown beast and guess which one survives! (hint: look at the star of the handfull of sequels) <br/><br/>Critics like this original, but prefer the testosteronal, explosive ALIENS, directed by (who else?) James Cameron as the best. But I put the original one notch above because it's creepier and more haunting than the sequels. The mood is opaque and the pacing is full of tension. Alien3 captured similar essence, but lost itself in continuous religious symbolism.<br/><br/>But not just the mood makes this flick great. The monster has influenced so much more horror into science fiction. A razor-toothed yang to the ying of past aliens like little green men with giant heads or Spielberg's crop of lovable, cuddly extraterrestrials. The set design paved way to gloomier visions of space travel, alien encounters, and the future itself. Even the claustrophobia experienced inside the spaceship (the setting of the whole movie) is echoed in DIE HARD.<br/><br/>But even if you strip all that away you still have the honest, full-throttle scares that have made horror movie history (ie the stomach bursting, alien in the vent, and the extended second set of jaws of the alien)"

It's too bad it wasn't allowed to stand alone, since to a certain to degree the sequels have diluted the formula of a film concentrating on one thing; terror. No time wasted on sub-plots or character development, or expensive sets and special effects.    The fact that the film is so good without all the additions that most people seem to feel films must have these days (Don't get me wrong, sometimes they help!), speaks volumes about its maturity, its directness, and also about moviemakers/moviegoers today.

","Alien is the first movie that really presents us with a small group of people in a claustrophobic environment where there really is no place to run (such as a spaceship, boat or submarine) being stalked by an unseen person/beast to the last survivor.  Sounds pretty general I know but this came first and they did it right.  Ridley Scott creates a perfect environment with shadow and steel turning the Nostromo into a floating coffin in space with an emphasis on the crews position as fish in a barrel.<br/><br/>The suspense is unrelenting and the viewer is brought to the POV of the hunted.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>The alien effects are at times excellent and other times lame.  The alien bursting out of the chest looks great.  But as it scampers away it looks like its being pulled by a string.  When the alien jumps out at the captain in the ducts it spreads its arms and scowls as if he's saying ""BOO!"" However the alien appearing out of the camouflage of the wall in the escape shuttle, and lowering himself from the ceiling looked fantastic.  My only other complaint is the cat.  Ripley goes back for the cat.  I don't think that is a realistic decision for a character like her.  After the death of the captain (and even before that) Ripley is a strong leader and is concerned primarily with three things 1) Her own survival 2) the safety of her remaining crew, and 3) destroying that thing.  The cat was good for some false scares, and atmosphere (I love the scene where the cat is hissing at the alien)   but it is a dumb precursor to the Newt character that bogged down Cameron's horrendous sequal that Ripley goes back for the  cat.  No one would do that.<br/><br/>**SPOILER END**<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet but be warned that moments of suspense become tedious on fourth or fifth viewing.  I love Geiger's alien especially the enigmatic aspect of its metamorphosis and life cycle.  Their is great talent in this movie all around, superb acting, skilled directing, and an intense story and script by Dan O'Banion, whom I suggest fans check out in the director's chair of ""RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD"" his send up of Romero's Dead trilogy.<br/><br/>On my five star rating this gets all five stars, but only three if you've already seen it more the twice, as suspense gives way to boredom."

You don't get to see the creature that much, which is good, because the appearance of this thing is not the interesting part (no offense to the creature designer H.R. Giger, it looks pretty good), the important thing is that it's there. One thing that makes Alien so good is that you don't know if the creature can be killed or not, which you knew already from the beginning in Aliens. But still the sequel gets a higher vote from me...

","""Alien"" ranks as one of the finest sci-fi movies ever made. One thing that makes this movie so unique, especially for its time, was that it combined elements of science fiction and horror. The spaceship, the outer-space setting and the alien itself (designed by H.R. Geiger) are the sci-fi elements. But when you get down to it, ""Alien"" is more of a horror movie, only with a spaceship instead of a haunted house and an alien instead of a monster. The claustrophobic setting and the dark corridors provide the right atmosphere for this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is wonderfully directed by Ridley Scott. The same man who would give us another sci-fi classic, ""Blade Runner,"" three years later. The special effects are impressive, especially for 1979. The pacing is handled very well, subtle in just the right moments and chaotic in just the right moments. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is wonderful. The only real flaw in the film is that it gets a little slow at times. Minor complaint though.<br/><br/>To see sci-fi cinema at its best, check out this movie and the excellent sequel that followed, ""Aliens."""

Ridley Scott moody and texturized visuals have been diluted in sequels but here they are fresh and vivid. Remarkable performances all around and special effects ahead of their time.

","In its time this was the most original sci-fi flick for years, I have never waited with so much anticipation for a movie to appear on TV. The plot is well known - a spacecraft picks up a distress call and the crew are awoken from hypersleep to investigate. What they find of course is a nasty little SOB alien that takes on the crew single-handed (clawed?). An excellent cast, my only complaint when I view the film now is the rather mumbled dialogue, giving the impression that some of it was ad-libbed. Most of the actors are well known; Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto and John Hurt for instance. Ironically it was the relative newcomer Sigourney Weaver who became the biggest star. More or less a ghost story set in outer space - in that something scary is attacking people, but we never quite see it until the end. Highly recommended."

","Alien is a very intense and interesting flick, which can really capture the imagination of a person, based on the viewers ability to focus and believe that what they're seeing is real. This was one of the sci-fi shockers I watched in the past that is just, unforgettable.  Based on H. R. Geiger's idea and realization of the alien creature, director Ridley Scott and author Dan O'Bannon create an adrenaline rockin' thriller, which I believe cannot and has not been surpassed.  The introduction of Sigourney Weaver as character W.O. Ripley, was one of the best things that could have happened to Weaver, and helped make her the star that she is today.  SFX in the movie won it an  Oscar in 1980, and assists in leaving the viewer a little anxious after the end, but with a clear idea of the memorable title, especially if viewed and read about in it's original ENTIRETY, and not the directors cut.  *Same things can be said about it's 3 ensuing sequels.

Sure, ''Aliens'' was really great, but it was more of an non-stop actionmovie, ''Alien 3'' was the boring part, and ''Alien Ressurection'' was a bit better, and way more entertaining.

","After 20 years, this is still the scariest and most suspenseful film I have ever seen. I was left rather in the cold after seeing James Cameron's sequel, Aliens, which is still very good, but can't hold a candle to Ridley Scott's classic in terms of shear terror. Some people complain that Alien is slow and thinking about it the pace of the actual script is leisurely. Yet from the start Scott creates an atmosphere that you can cut with a knife and moves the film along so that two hours pass by all too quickly. Its basically a haunted house in space as Scott preys on everyone's primal fears about the bogey man fear of the dark... and takes them too their extremes. Production values art direction, SFX, Jerry Goldsmith's score and performances from Weaver especially but also from British stars Ian Holm and John Hurt (Until he gets serious tummy trouble) is impeccable. The famous scene when the alien bursts out of his stomach still makes me feel queasy and this is an objective exercise in understated direction and the fear of the unknown (you don't see the creature until the very end) that is far scarier than Cameron's 1986 blast fest. A classic. 10/10!"

","Alien truly is a landmark film. It had excellent direction, acting, set design, and special effects.<br/><br/>What most new viewers don't realize ( Like those who saw Aliens first)is that the Alien motion picture was originally a horror/suspense film, not a sci-fi action film. This movie was not meant to show guns blazing or people getting murdered every 5 seconds.<br/><br/>This film is about the terror of being preyed upon by a monster that is unstoppable. For those who say nothing happens, that's because the mystery and suspense of the alien creature was wasted when you saw one of the other alien movies, which spoil this mood. The director set a creepy, dark, suspenseful mood with the help of art director H.R. Giger, then let loose a very creative looking alien. What made this film so scary was that we did not see the entire alien. When it shows up we get just enough of a glimpse to make us fear it. This great craft was wasted in the sequel, where the alien just becomes another villain in the mountain of other alien monsters out there.<br/><br/>Overall, THE best science-fiction horror film for those with enough wits to realize the suspense and originality of it all."

Friends constantly tell me ""yeah, but 'Aliens' was better"" (much like the people who post here) and I am always telling them why it is a very good film, but totally different from the classic original.

I suspect that if people hadn't seen Aliens and possibly Alien 3 first they would have a different opinion.<br/><br/>Alien is a masterpiece.  It's wonderful attention to detail and the slow build up to the eventual chaos of the final crescendo is marvellous. There is such belief and tension even in the early scene's in the space ship and especially when the crew first encounters the Alien.<br/><br/>The special effects are excellent and even by Todays standard.<br/><br/>I've read other reviews and people have criticised the long periods where nothing happens and that you don't see the creature.  This is essence is the point of the film.  In 1979 this set a landmark.  If you saw the creature constantly it would ruin the fear element.  The slow scene's built up vulnerability and tension.  You were constantly terrified that the creature was lurking in the dark just around the corner.<br/><br/>The main theme of this film was that this creature, was a monster, but yet was superior to the humans.  It could think, and was almost invincible (this idea was destroyed in Aliens).<br/><br/>All the credit goes down to Ripley Scott, the writers and lot to Mr Giger for creating a believable tension filled, scary movie that won't be forgotten.<br/><br/>Definitely a classic."

","It becomes more than a little depressing after a while, when people discuss this film and say: ""It's OK, but Aliens is way better!"" The reason, apparently, is that in Alien, ""nothing happens,"" whereas Aliens is ""Kick-ass!"" Quite. The sad thing is, I know how they feel, since I used to agree with them. James Cameron's sequel has far more action in it - ie, weapons are actually used effectively against the aliens - and is a more traditional crowd-pleaser. Its main fan-base consists of undemanding teenagers, (who no doubt fast-forward through the first hour of the film, since nothing happens in it) who enjoy quoting amongst their friends such classic lines as: ""Let's rock!"", ""Get away from her, you bitch!"" and ""F**k you!"" I have nothing against this viewpoint as such, and they're entitled to their opinions, but it would be nice if they could justify them with something more than they do. It can hardly be insignificant that most of this Alien's detractors find it difficult to string a grammatically correct sentence together to oppose it; sorry if that sounds unpleasant, but I think it's unfair that such a brilliant and important film should be given such a raw deal so much of the time. I suppose, as mindless Hollywood action films go, Aliens isn't so bad, and the series as a whole is far superior to many others - but the first is the only one I could ever call a good film. It is far more intelligent, frightening, visually impressive, inventive, and far better acted, directed and scored than any of its sequels or imitators.

Everything is meticulously laid out before us and this adds to the element of fear that Alien is famous for.  I have to say that Aliens scared me more that almost any other film ever made and although I personally find Alien to be very good, (but just a step under Cameron's version and vision) it has to be said that this movie is very frightening and it is extremely well made.  There is quite a bit of tension in here and it stars Tom Skerrit, that alone makes it worth the price of a rental.  I think this is the perfect predecessor to Aliens.  You should see this before you watch the second one.  They complement each other perfectly.

The alien is clearly a foe that could pose a serious threat to humanity if it were allowed to colonize human populouses.  Ripley, the hero of the film knows that she is fighting a superior adversary, but this does not hinder her actions.  Like the alien, Ripley must think logically, and critically of her situation.  She uses her ingenuity and resolve to conquer the unconquerable. Because of Ripley, we as viewers can live vicariously.  The threats of the unknown are no longer fearful, but a challenge, a thrill, a wanted escape. We can be assaulted by extreme odds of  alien insects, asteroids the size of the moon that will destroy the Earth, even natural phenomenon.

The commercial starship Nostromo is returning to Earth with 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore when its main central computer, ""Mother"", interrupts the journey and informs the crew that they must investigate a distress signal coming from planet LV-426. When three crew members go and search the surface for this signal, one of them ends up with something on his face, a parasite or facehugger. Later on, it falls off of his face and he seems to be fine but little did anyone know that the facehugger planted an Alien inside his body, which bursts from his chest in a shocking scene. As the remaining crew members hunt for the creature, it has shed its skin and grown into a very scary creature. It kills each crew member until only Ellen Ripley is left, which leads to a final showdown in a small shuttle she escapes in after detonating the Nostromo. Alien is so much more entertaining than any of its successors. It has the claustrophobic atmosphere, characters you care about and Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) at her finest! She uses her wits and intelligence to kill the creature, not machine guns and grenades like in ""Aliens"". Everyone puts in a great performance.

","It is interesting to note that both Ridley Scott and Robert Wise never made their name from directing any one genre of film.  In fact, they seem to go out of their way to make as diverse range of films as possible:<br/><br/>Gladiator; Thelma and Louise; The Duellists; (Ridley Scott), The Day The Earth Stood Still; West Side Story; Sound of Music; (Robert Wise).<br/><br/>Yet they both managed, in my view, to make the two most effective horror films in their era: The Haunting (1963, Wise) and Alien (1979, Scott).<br/><br/>I think what the two men have in common, is their approach to filmmaking, which is treating their audiences with great maturity. This is the antithesis of modern filmaking now, especially in the horror genre.<br/><br/>Scott has approached Alien as he would any one of his films: to tell a good story as effectively as possible without insulting the audience.<br/><br/>The result being a plot that is, if one is honest, not far removed from any of the slasher flicks of the eighties such as Friday the 13th, where the cast systematically get bumped off one by one.<br/><br/>Where Alien differs greatly, though, is the sheer understatedness of the whole thing.  From the lighting and sets to the superb ensemble acting, the whole movie is flawless.  The alien is totally believable with a life cycle of its own.<br/><br/>Scott paints his canvas with greys and blues, then to complete his composition, adds a splash of scarlet - (you'll know it when you see it).<br/><br/>Like Wise's The Haunting, Scott's Alien sticks to the adage 'less is more'. Thankfully, we hardly see the alien though one could argue for a change, as the design of the alien is so good, whether seeing just a tad MORE of the alien would have helped the audience along a bit.<br/><br/>It's a small point, for it doesn't detract from the fact that Alien is one of the most important films of its genre in the last 40 years.  This year Alien will be 23 years old.  A new generation of DVD viewers is now enjoying a movie that hasn't aged a jot and can still hold its own in the 21st century."

Also, the best thing I find about Alien and Aliens is the fact that the Aliens are still tall guys in rubber suits (not the obviously computer animated aliens in Alien 3 and to a lesser extent Ressurection).<br/><br/>Personally, I find the original is still the best, followed by Aliens (especailly Cameron's acknowledgement of Dan O'Bannon's earlier and very funny film Dark Star where Boiler attempts the knife trick but to less effect than Bishop has).  Alien Ressurection is number three...at first I hated it but then it grew on me, mainly due to the fact that Junet directed it (of whom I have great respect).<br/><br/>I have mixed emotions over the rumours of a fifth installment, being that fifth would be highly risky, as Resurrection illustrated.<br/><br/>To those who haven't seen Alien, go to your video store immediately for a film which the industry is yet to equal."

Ripley is a complex character, one who does what she's told, yet is able to put her fears behind her, and get the job done. That takes courage, something not even macho men have.

"BaronBl00d","Null","0","1","9 February 2002"," Ground-breaking Sci-fi/Horror Masterpiece
","Alien...a masterpiece?  Yes, I think it has stood the test of time very well.  It has had three QUALITY(if not even) sequels.  It has more than amply influenced all science fiction films to come after it.  It made the female macho heroine stock rather than exceptional.  It has so immersed us in its design, sets, and situations as to even be used of late in some kind of snack food commercial and be lampooned by Mel Brooks.  The story of the Nostromo and crew going to a dead planet after hearing some kind of distress signal is all too recognizable.  While there, one of their party has a baby alien attatch itself to his face, later his belly opens up and a small alien rips its way out.  The alien grows with great speed and soon is a giant of a stowaway on this small, 7-manned crew commercial ship.  Predator and prey meet.  While the basic story is fairly simple, some of the overlying themes used in Dan O'Bannon's script reek with thought-provoking insights into the division of science and humanity(or humanism if you prefer).  What lengths should science go to acquire new knowledge?  What are necessary sacrifices? The script also details the greedy exploits of business with the Mother company being all too concerned with possible military profits rather than the lives of its crew.  Ridley Scott directs with definite style, if not a bit plodding through much of the first half of the film.  The sets used are breath-taking, and the scientific mumbo jumbo presented is given its full due in explanation and observable merit.  The special effects department really does a great job with the alien creature as it is truly one of the most menacing monsters to grace the screen in some time.  Acting honors go to Sigourney Weaver in her penultimate role as Ripley, the head-strong, no-nonsense, by the book navigator that manages to elude the alien for some time.  Her wits and its hostility lock horns in some great film sequences. Scott's use of bleak metal exteriors really enhances the mood of doom, despair, and futility that pervades the film.  The rest of the cast is very good with Ian Holm standing out as an android of sorts whose only goal is securing knowledge at any price.  While not as gritty or energized as its sequel Aliens, Alien is one of the finest horror/sci-fi films made in the last twenty-five years.  It will go on being an inspiration to future genre films for some time."

","I remember seeing this film for the first time when I was 15. I was always interested in sci-fi as a genre but i was very surprised how they could meld this with horror in such a style.<br/><br/>Story goes...  the crew of a cargo ship named the Nostromo pick up a distress signal from a nearby remote planet. Upon investigation one of the crew members enters a derelict spaceship and returns with some kind of parasite attached to his face. Later on this parasite is known to have laid an egg inside of the crew member and it eventually hatches! The creature then grows and picks off each crew member off one by one.<br/><br/>Sounds simple? Well, the premise may be but the execution is great. Ridley Scotts direction is near perfect and the style and use of colors are spot on! I particularly like the fact that there isn't directly a main character, but each crew member is unique and equal. It only becomes more apparant by the end of the film who those main characters are.<br/><br/>I personally didnt find Alien scary but I did find it extremely tense.

","What can you say about ""Alien""? It's remained one of my all time favourite films for the past twenty years. It is so visually sophisticated and stunning that I still find it hard to believe that it was made in 1979.<br/><br/>
I love Ridley Scott's direction and the sheer atmosphere that the movie creates - especially through its fantastic design and terrifying storyline. The acting is superb too - such strong characters developed in such a short time (i.e. before the cast is eaten!!).<br/><br/>Much has been written about the primeval nature of Giger's design - the alien planet with its eggs, and the creature itself with its strong sexual overtones. ""Alien"" lends itself well to a feminist, as well as a Freudian reading, both of which are plausible and enhance the enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>
I saw it, on a hot summer's afternoon, about three years after its general release, at the Northfield Odeon cinema in West London. This was in the days when cinemas still had BIG screens. To add to the atmosphere, I was one of only four or five others in the audience. After the show I accidentally exited though the wrong door and found myself in a curving corridor behind the screen! This was dimly lit, painted in matt black and had pipes running along the wall. It felt like I had done a ""Last Action Hero"" and entered the spaceship!<br/><br/>I must have watched ""Alien"" twenty times over the years and never get tired of it. I also always feel a sense of foreboding at what is about to happen. In my opinion, it's one of the greatest horror films ever made."

Alien is such a simple concept as the one's you find in video games: you are alone trapped with a killing menace and you have no way to escape: the way out is to kill it. But the way the story is depicted is what makes it. You could not expect this plot-line to be better handled (especially if one considers the menace is an alien.) than it was in this movie. The crew of the Nostromo is a group of people as distinct as your own group of co-workers with all the pros and cons that come with them.<br/><br/>The best thing about this picture is that it doesn't seem that you're watching a picture at all, it seems more like an edited set of images someone collected from a real ship. And even if it doesn't have that constant action of Aliens, it is far better to watch .The way it would be like if it happened for real. The strain is so intense that you can almost see it in the air. For the people who watched it before ALIENS, I'm sure they weren't expecting to see Ripley being the one who made it.Since I'm a woman myself, I like it that she and the cat were the one's who managed to pull through.<br/><br/>This is still one of the pictures that scared me the most.try watching it alone in a dark living room like I did the first time, not knowing what to expect from it.

Also, none of these actors were exactly box-office draws in 1979.  People might have not even gone to see this film based on that fact alone, but this movie had something that trancended star power.  The fourth reason for it's success is the excellent production of everything that you see on screen.  There are movies that cost 80 Million dollars, and don't look this good!!

"XRANDY","Null","0","1","2 December 2001"," Not so much sci-fi, as curiously realistic
","WARNING SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Though I had already seen this movie several times I was happy to watch it again during a film class in college called `Film and the American Hero'. The professor's goal obviously was to present a female protagonist for the course and he couldn't have done any better than the stirring character Ripley, played so dexterously by Sigourney Weaver. 	Though this would have been a great film without her, Weaver is outstanding as the confident ship officer turned termagant in order to battle the redoubtable, invidious foe that is the alien.  There is something indefinable about the expressions on her face that impel her character. Some sort of inner turmoil that surfaces in her countenance and mien.  She is also so subtlety sexy!  And if I may take a puerile moment; to see her scampering about in her underwear (obiter dictum--what a lithe, beautiful stomach) is a great amenity.<br/><br/>
 	But it is more than the sylph that is Weaver that drives this motion picture.  For me it is the `reality' of the show.  So much so that I don't even categorize it as science-fiction.   Even though it is set in the future in an unknown section of the universe you don't have to suspend disbelief because of the verisimilitude that director Ridley Scott creates.   First he establishes characters that, even though they are placed in a time years from our own, they are still very authentic, complete with foibles and idiosyncrasies.  They gripe, laugh, misjudge, and most of all fear.  They show us that man as man has survived he also brings the concomitant social problems, in this case class struggle.<br/><br/> They also remind us that no matter what technological advances mankind discovers, we will always be human.  Not that the machines are perfect. Scott creates an industrial background that is grimy and foreboding.  It is purposely done so as to not give an illusion of a glossed-over future. Scott wants you to know that this version of the future will not be spotless.  His machines are dirty, and function haphazardly from the granular video screens to malfunctioning motion-detectors.  They are noisy and require repairs.  The machines are not, shall we say, exactly simpatico. In fact they are in two exigent instances (the insidious android and the self-destructing vessel) they are arrantly malevolent.  It is against this mise en scene that Scott adroitly makes us take into account the periphery of his camera shots while dangling cords and industrial works meld darkly into a baleful background.  This is culminated in the shocking revelation that the creature has hidden itself on the shuttle among the machinery. What ultimately gives this film a noumenal aspect is the monster itself.  Of all the characters the monster is perhaps the most `real'.  This fierce beast is a quasi spider/wasp mixture and if we look at the horror of the everyday insect world (where blood is viciously drained from weaker life forms, and victims are implanted with eggs that survive like parasites on their tissue) we see how a creature sharing these characteristics, enhanced by size can be particularly virulent.  It is how one would expect such an animal be (the acid-for-blood thing is a little far out but even so, it is one of the monster's most interesting features and nicely increases the tension by complicating how the crew has to handle destroying it).<br/><br/>
The underlying symbolism of course is the feminine turmoil.  The tunnels of the planet as well as the workings of the ship (called `Mother') clearly are a physical representation of the inner reproductive system/vaginal wall of a woman.  The creature itself is a symbol or reproduction and evolution with its protean abilities.  It is a paradox of growth and destruction.  It represents the dichotomy of the life-giving femininity and the threat of male-dominated violence.  Scott exemplifies this symbolism with the coterminous forced-fellatio scene (with a porno mag as an ordure touch) and the part of the film when the woman is killed by the alien as it advances upon her not recklessly, but slowly, furtively (seductively?) reaching a limb behind, and then up, her leg.<br/><br/>
Of course the irony is that a woman destroys the evil entity in the end engendering a conclusion that poses the theory that survival is epicene.  A very interesting concept."

","To judge ALIEN against its sequels is to blame Eve for handing Adam that damned Granny Smith! Without Ridley Scott's masterpiece, there would BE no sequels!<br/><br/>ALIEN is almost 23 years old and stands even now as the benchmark for films of this ilk. Even the fabulously entertaining ALIENS did not (and nor did it TRY) replicate its claustrophobic fear, its style, its inventiveness. Ridley Scott is a one-of-a-kind director. Like Stanley Kubrick (and I do not seek to equate them here) he has an individuality that comes through in his movies and stamps them as being HIS alone. ALIEN, LEGEND, BLADE RUNNER and of course GLADIATOR all bear the mark. The sensitivity, the human angle, the unique (at some point) blue lit filtered backdrop. He is an artiste!<br/><br/>ALIEN has dated very little, evidenced only by the youth of the actors. Can anyone see a similarity (more-so in attitude) between the young Sigourney Weaver and Jane Fonda in her youth?<br/><br/>The bridge of the Nostromo, made up primarily from electronic junk lying around the place was innovative (agreed, ""Mother"" looks rather old hat, especially with her clunky old DOS interface!) The storyline has been re-hashed so many times since, but in 1979 it was fresh and cutting-edge stuff. The interior of the alien craft with the 'space jockey' was a jaw-dropping visual and the barely-glimpsed alien, fear incarnate! Not too many bio-mechanical twin jaw chompers before IT! The ONLY time the alien looked even vaguely suss was when Ripley blasted it out of the airlock. Just for a second one had an impression of the old ""man-in-a-suit"" routine!<br/><br/>Characterizations were superb, as they were in ALIENS! The demise of Lambert particularly, brings the horror of the alien confrontingly close to the viewer. Electronic sound fx and the musical score serve to heigten suspense at key moments, of which there are several. In the upshot however, the film belongs to Weaver as Ripley (although a young Ian Holm is brilliant as Ash - watch his facial expressions!) a model of constructive thinking, resourcefulness and bravery.<br/><br/>No, they don't come much better than this!"
"N293G-STU","Null","0","1","25 October 2001"," Simply a masterpiece
","'Alien' is one of the greatest sci-fi films ever to grace the silver screen. It is also one of the scariest. Technical limitations (ie, the alien was a guy in a suit), meant the creature is not seen as much as was first proposed. Like 'Jaws', this 'less is more' scenario worked to the film's advantage - it became scarier as we never really got to see the whole alien.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is top notch. Enlisting the talent of surrealist H.R. Giger was a masterstroke. His visualisation of the alien life cycle is superb and engrained on the public conscious (the horrific John Hurt sequence is the main reason for this).<br/><br/>The sound department also did an ace job on the film. All the eerie music, alien screams, computer noises etc are superb. This attention to the sound helps darken the atmosphere, essential for a horror film.<br/><br/>All of the actors give very good performances as the mining ship crew. Sigourney Weaver is particularly strong but my favourite performance comes from Sir Ian Holm as Science Officer Ash. A brilliant actor, Holm plays his part in 'Alien' to perfection.<br/><br/>In general, I would thoroughly recommend 'Alien' to anyone who has not yet seen it. Made in 1979, some things look a little dated but I defy anyone who is not shocked by 'the John Hurt scene' the first time they see it. Simply a masterpiece."

","""Alien"" is a dark tour of suspense and terror which grabs ahold of the viewer,wrapping that viewer with elements of simplifying atmosphere of sci-fi terror.It's a film that has elements of darkness,making us feel vulnerable at times.The highpoint of this film is that it still stands towering above it's three sequels and it's imitators.I enjoyed all four ""Alien"" films. What makes this film such a classic is the way director Ridley Scott puts characters into certain situations that makes us feel vulnerable.The trailer for the film,the narrator says,""In space,no one can hear you scream"".Ridley Scott reminds us that we are really in space and that in space there is no escape from terror.""Alien"" is the kind of sci-fi,horror film that set the standard for films today like""Event Horizon"",although that was a supernatural film,it was still set on a spaceship.This film is a truly a classic for it's kind and the visual effects are tremendously spectacular.""Alien"" is the real classic of sci-fi horror films."

","As fast as George Lucas made space seem fun and exciting, Alien made it hostile and claustrophobic. No one knew that birds could be our arch enemies until Hitchcock. No one believed of a 25 foot White Shark prowling your coast until Spielberg. And no one knew how terrifying space could be until Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger showed us the ""Alien."" One thing that makes this movie seem so real is the characters, who seem like you and me. For instance, the first conversation in the movie is a discussion over contracts and fair shares of money. Unlike Alien's many ripoffs, these aren't gung-ho space cowboys; they are normal people that just want to be paid and go home. This is what makes you care when they die. *Spoilers Ahead* One ingenius thing I think Scott did with this movie is the body count. All but one character is killed off. Obviously, people are gonna die in a movie like this, but after awhile people start to think ""uh...wait a minute. That's a bit much, how many are left now?"" And when Ripley is left alone, you too, feel alone in the Nostromo, which makes it seem so scary. The alien design itself is amazing, and makes the movie work. You can't be that dramatic in showing the alien little by little unless you have an alien that is so unique that it is actually worth waiting till the end to see it. H.R. Giger has quite an imagination. The special effects, although maybe not as flashy as, say, Star Wars, are effective and amazing. Sigourney Weaver gives a very good performance as does the rest of the cast, more specifically Yaphett Koto and whoever played Ash. James Cameron's sequel ""Aliens"" most definitly equals this movie, and is surprisingly inventive for a sequel, but the original is the one that started it all. I highly reccomend seeing the entire trilogy (yes the trilogy) and leave ""Ressurection"" alone (I covered that more in my review of Ressurection). I give this a 8/10 for inventiveness, darkness, and suspense."

","Alien was the start of a new genre of science fiction flicks. In that respect, it stands out.It also gave birth to a series that has become somewhat iconic in the movie viewing community. I am however baffled by the awe, admiration and high praise given to the first Alien movie.<br/><br/>The concept of space horror was not new in 1979, however the expression of that concept in Alien was unique, revolutionary. The landscape and scenery were fantastic and the monsters (Alien) were incredibly designed for maximum terror impact.<br/><br/>Now did anyone notice that the storyline itself was ridiculous? Much of the trouble these intrepid travelers got themselves into was a result of idiotic decisions not explained by motivations of greed, duty, loyalty or what have you.<br/><br/>To create suspense the crew were made to take the kind of stupid, incautious actions that is typical of B-grade horror flicks.<br/><br/>1)Gung-ho and headlong exploration of unchartered and potentially dangerous territory without proper surveillance with available technology.<br/><br/>2)Introduction of the threat to the colony by inane decisions that are unlikely to occur in real life.<br/><br/>3)Exposure to the threat without adequate protection during experimentation and study.<br/><br/>4)No such thing as quarantine to people exposed to a strange phenomenon<br/><br/>5)The classic, lets separate to fight the foe, so we can get picked off one by one.<br/><br/>And the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>Quite a lot of Hollywood types are school dropouts, and it reflects in some of the junk that is pumped out of the mill - costing millions. Those that are smart are often compelled by coercion or greed to cater to the lowest common denominator.<br/><br/>Final analysis: This expression of the space horror genre was revolutionary. The special effects,and technology driven aspects were a masterpiece. The storyline was ridiculous, totally implausible, even for science fiction"

","Wow, this is probably my favorite film of all time.  It has all the elements of a scary space film.  The dark setting inside the Nostromo is psychologically disturbing, from it's dimly lighted corridors,  large mechanical chambers with clattering chains dangling down, to the eerie rumbling sound the ship makes throughout the whole behemoth.  Add in a terrifying extraterrestial that's on the loose and you have one hell of a scary film.<br/><br/>The alien in the film is what makes the film so scary.  It's clever design by H.R. Giger is probably the most terrifying thing you will ever see, and few designers will ever be able to create a creature of this magnitude. Ash's last words to Ripley about this ""perfect organism"" describes it best. All the characters in the film are likable, and they all have different attitudes which makes their interaction the more interesting.<br/><br/>
My favorite scene in the film is when Brett was first attacked and for the first time we get to see the alien in its adult form.  The execution of this scene left a deep impression inside me, especially the part when Jones the cat gave a snarl then back off slowly when the alien dropped down.<br/><br/>
Two thumbs up for Ridley Scott."

Tremendously paced & photographed by director Ridley Scott, keeping you on the edge of the seat till the very end.  Sigourney Weaver is not necessarily the star in this movie, she just happens to be the only survivor, and then goes on to be the star in the many sequels that follow. There are many well done things in this movie including the transition of the alien itself from the attached lifeform on John Hurt's character's face to the almost human-like appearance that it has near the end.   The story itself is simple but the characters are very down to earth and believable enough that you do care for them unlike some cheap horror movies where the characters are so stupid that you want them to die.  It is no doubt why the movie started a trend of these type of pictures because of it's obvious box-office appeal and the quality that was put into it.  It's successors of course do not come close to the type of all-around quality that is displayed in this picture."
"gstiger","10","0","1","31 May 2001"," Alien is sleek and stylish science fiction film.
","Through its magnificent sets, story, and characters, Alien would influence many science fiction films that would follow it; though few would ever equal it. <br/><br/>Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's screenplay is good and very original. The one drawback is the minor subplot involving Ian Holm's character, Ash, which is fairly interesting but I always felt that it bogged the film down.<br/><br/>
Overall, the cast is pretty good. Tom Skerritt does a nice job at underplaying his character of Captain Dallas. Sigourney Weaver, Harry Dean Stanton, and Ian Holm also give commendable performances.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's direction is phenomenal. His attention to detail is astounding. He takes full advantage of his sets, music, and lighting to make the film as eerie as possible.<br/><br/>Jerry Goldsmith's subtle musical score is great; it is very effective and quite ominous and unnerving. <br/><br/>The art direction and set decoration in Alien is absolutely terrific. The sets are large and yet they have a very claustrophobic feel.<br/><br/>
The special effects for the alien creature are quite convincing. The full-grown alien is not shown in prolonged shots or whole-body shots. This is a wise decision on the filmmakers' part; had the alien been shown in full body shots it would have given the impression of someone in a suit and so it wouldn't have been as convincing. <br/><br/>Alien is a worthy addition to anyone's film library."

But there is a deeper meaning in this film that really makes it great. 1979 saw the beginning of the de-regulation in government/business relations, as well as our first experience with the threat of problems with nuclear power plants. The "" Alien"" represents nuclear power as a dangerous, and unpredictable resource that we need to study more before using it more freely. Risking the  lives of the entire crew for the good of the company foreshadowed the loss of union strength in business during the 1980's.

""IT, the Terror from Beyond Space"" is a forerunner of this film, but Scott has elevated the horror story way beyond those 50's monster flicks(don't get me wrong, I love those old horror films).The tensions build slowly and then reach fever pitch.From a deserted rock of a planet to the dark cooling tunnels of the ship, Scott has created a vision of the future that looks and feels authentic.A landmark film that changed the look of this genre for a long time to come.

The characters are interesting, my favorites being Ash and Parker. My favorite scene is the infamous and oft-copied chest-bursting scene, where an alien bursts out of Kane's [John Hurt] stomach. That is what made this movie a classic. It's probably the goriest moment ever put on film. My one problem with ""Alien"" is the sometimes slow pacing.

","OK, so sound doesn't travel well in a vacuum, yet we still hear the sound of the ship's engines in space.  But what the hey!  Ridley Scott had realism in his mind when he made this classic - 99% of the gadgets in the film actually worked.  The cast is second to none, and proved that using a mix of British and American actors was the way to go.  His almost fly-on-the-wall approach paid off so well in setting up the characters.  Suspicion and suspense were the keys; the mystery of the alien; the quirkiness of Ian Holm's acting.  I first watched this film at the tender age of 10, on a friend's aunt's pirate video (she was one of the first people in our area to have a VCR!), around 1980.  And it scared the hell out of me!  Again, this film is superior to its great sequels.  But it shouldn't really be compared, having a style all its own.  Compared to more recent horror films, it may not have the same impact.  If you haven't seen this film, rent it, turn the lights off, start the film, and feel the tension."

The sound is also perfect, with a calm ambiance, that suddenly breaks, but stays in a very special mood.  The acting is very good, especially from Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm.  It's one of those ""It started it all"" movies...many many many cheap and stupid rip-offs were made...the storyline is so simple, but they made such a beautiful film with it.  And in despise of what many people say, ""Aliens"" isn't better than ""Alien"", it's just about the action factor...but the beauty of the first one is only seen in the first one...The storyline is the following: Some people on a spaceship capture a creature on a strange planet, and it evolves, and starts killing the passengers...conventional, you'll say?  Maybe, but being conventional can be very good, it depends on the what you do with your storyline...let's take the example of ""Sleepy Hollow"" from director Tim Burton, which has a very simple story, but the images are so nice and perfect, and dark that you can enjoy a lot more the movie than you would enjoy a very complex movie...""Alien"" is for people who can recognize good directing, and a good atmosphere, otherwise, if you prefer action, see ""Aliens"" or ""Alien:Resurrection"".

I originally saw it on the big screen and several times since have buckled my recliner harness and resnugged it as I share the mission with Ripley on the ole boob tube. The movie lives on as much as a double mouthed, acid spewing melon head alien. It is a classic that will endure through time.<br/><br/>It raised the level of Sci-Fi movies and also raised the bar on special effects for the entire industry. This movie changed how creatures in other movies appear. The creature's skull is even seen in Predator II. Creatures in video games started resembling this bad guy. As I watch this movie my senses are ignited as I am devoured by the 117 minutes. The planet where the alien is first encountered always resurges my curiosity like spinach to Popeye. When I see those relics and those huge bones of some other victim or host I always try to envision what happened on that planet. The alien itself is surrounded by more mystery than a Florida election. The creature is beautiful in a creepy, crawly, biological sort of way. The creator of this beauty is one heck of an artist. The creature has a plan just like salmon swimming up stream. The story line is very clever and is played out on film ""awesomely"".<br/><br/>The blood and gooo is relative to the action and is not the star of the show by any means. There are a several spots a weak stomached person may feel like tossing their cookies, but its not the highlight of any action. What I am trying to say is the gross stuff adds to the story rather than just trying to get you to go ""oooooh thats gross, rewind it, I want to see that again!"" It fits in with the flick.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is Ripley, a Warrant officer who becomes cannon fodder for the government. The tale proves that greed can flourish in the dark cold vacuum of outer space and that the long arm of the government is reeeeeeal long. Those pigs! Sigourney plays the role perfectly. She is as tough as a cheap steak. I usually don't find tough women in movies very believabe (sorry, I know thats not politically correct), but Sigourney never leaves me with even a xenomorph of a doubt. She is a survivalist in a pair of bikini panties. The rest of the cast does a decent job but Sig is the one that shines. There will also be a couple of other faces you will recognize.<br/><br/>The lighting, sound effects, props, music, etc is all there like pigment on a canvas.

The reason being, the direction of both james Cameron (Aliens) and especially Brit Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>I consider a good film to be a good story that is well produced and has a feeling that you are actually amongst them.  I got this feeling right from the start of the eerie musical score opening up the film, an act of sheer quality.<br/><br/>Im not gonna lie, i saw the sequel before i saw this one, i was expecting it to be quite similar but boy they are two different kind of films altogether. The 1st one being a suspenseful horror and the 2nd being an action horror.<br/><br/>Alien made the filming careers of everyone that had an envolvement in this movie, especially Sigourney Weaver and also Ridley Scott who went on to make the brilliant Blade Runner and Gladiator.<br/><br/>*SPOILER*<br/><br/>Ridley scotts methods of directing were well noticed throughout this movie, for example, the large method of suspense that he used for the environment of the nostromo.  Everytime a door opened you wondered what was coming out the other end, the suspense was also largely due to the brilliant music score aswell which constantly gave an edge of the seat feeling all the way through this ride.<br/><br/>Ridley scott also involved the actual cast into a little bit of suspense through the introduction of the parasite via the death of Kane (John Hurt). The cast were unaware of what was planed by the director and were told to act freely, this was a brilliant idea from the director and it showed a sense of fear from the cast.  Sheer brilliance.<br/><br/>Finally the characters in this film were outstanding, they were not over the top like they are in most cheesey sci-fi films (deep rising and Virus), and this merited the film to where it is now, a landmark.<br/><br/>i gave this film 10/10 - like im sure many of the users did at this site.<br/><br/>Lets give praise to the ultimate sci-fi horror ever to be made!"

","I rented ""Alien"" recently. It is now one of my favorite science fiction/horror films. Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Ian Holm, and three others are on the ship Nostromo, heading back to Earth. They crash land on a bizarre planet harboring large eggs which contain a slimy parasite resembling an oversized hermit crab. One of the parasites attaches itself to a crew member and he is brought back on the ship...terror ensues as the creature does some funny things (i won't ruin them for you)...and quickly grows into a slimy monster with like 10 mouths full of razor-sharp teeth. There is blood, gore, excellent suspense, good acting, good direction, and nice music. I really love this film and plan to see the sequels. Enjoyable, shocking, fast-paced...see it!!!"

"The_Movie_Cat","7","0","3","9 November 2000"," Odd One Out
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Watching Alien as a self-contained film is almost impossible nowadays, as you're constantly reminded of other, related, media. There's (for me, anyway), a constant mental image of Ian Holm as the pervy Lewis Carroll in the film ""Dreamchild""; Or Yaphet Kotto as top James Bond villain Kananga from ""Live and Let Die"". Then there's the sets, which were accurately reproduced for seasons three-five of Red Dwarf. Finally, there's the sequels themselves. In fact, the sequels are so well-known that seeing a third-in-command Sigourney who just happens to be the lone survivor and looks, frankly, a bit of a dog, is a strange one. All the performances are underplayed, rather than the overstatement that occurs in the second and fourth movies, though the characters aren't especially well-developed. Only Ripley, Dallas (Tom Skerrit) and Ash (Holm) get vaguely three-dimensional characters, while John Hurt is just a cameo. The sole black member of the crew, Parker (Kotto), is possibly the most obnoxious, an unfortunate characterisation that dates the film, along with the modest matte effects. And talking of dated, what about that sexist underwear shot in the final scenes? Sigourney strips down to a skimpy T-shirt, with the camera pointed upwards so we can see her chest heave up and down, and that's to say nothing of her pants. Could the production team not afford a bigger pair? Ridiculously small, they show her bum crack hanging over the top like a bricklayer's. <br/><br/>Ultimately, now the film has its less-mature sequels, they have effectively killed it. The naff CGI of the last two isn't half as good as here, yet now we've seen mobile aliens, the rather static men-in-suits just won't do either. The smaller aliens are probably the best, the ""facehugger"" looking like a spider and a snake all at the same time. Yuck! The worst alien has to be the baby, though. If you put a laughter track on the movie sometimes it would seem entirely appropriate. For the ""classic"" scene where John Hurt gives birth is hilarious, and again one can't help but be reminded of the skit in the underrated ""Spaceballs"" where the alien pops out and starts tap-dancing. Here, the baby alien is so laughably phallic that Sigourney looks around and says ""now where did I put those batteries?"" as soon as she sees it. Well, maybe not, but she should have done. Of course, while exploitative, Scott's direction is the best-ever for the series. Where the second is action, the third gothic and the fourth dumb comedy, this one is supposed to be a horror movie in space. So I suppose the question should be: is it scary? Well, I jumped once, and there was one other place where jumping was a possibility, so I guess that makes the original sort of okay. But the use of cosy motifs throughout, such as the ginger cat that outlives them all (including Weaver bashing his carry-box around in the last ten minutes), and the alien snoring do not make this a trip to the laundrette for anyone. Ripley gets her best characterisation, slowly progressing from icy, dutiful officer to disillusioned aggressor who shouts ""bitch"" a lot. But the original is now overshadowed by its immediate successor, and it's hard to say why it is better, though it is superior to the Cameronised model in many ways. Far more sophisticated than whatever followed, and also more psychological, from the face-rape of Hurt to the phallic imagery of the big alien, the original still has a lot going for it. But looked at in hindsight, and there is no other way to view it, it lacks the action it's successors have dictated the films must contain. It remains the odd one out in it's own series."

","Ridley Scott's frenetic camera work combined with the nightmarish, yet genius biomechanoid visions of H. R. Giger brought us the most hideous, disgusting creatures that ever might be out there in deep space.   The theme of the movie is often imitated, but never executed as well -- even in its own sequels.<br/><br/>With lurking not uncommon to the mythical realms of Howard Phillips Lovecraft, the creature is out there in the shadows, camouflaged by the technical scenery.  Sleek and slowly it creeps, yet jumps quick to the attack, jaws slashing, screaming.  <br/><br/>More than scary, this film taps into the fears of the unknown and leaves us there unguarded."

"jimbofletch","10","0","1","1 October 2000"," Goddamned company! What about our lives you son of a ....
","Along with Blade Runner, Alien marks the career highpoint of Ridley Scott, who in these two films manages to provide enough depth and character to match his visual splendour, unlike efforts such as Legend and Black Rain, which although looking brilliant, are relatively hollow films. Initially this may seem like a simple horror with its crew of a mining vessel being eliminated one by one by a cold-blooded alien, and structurally it follows a lot of the same plot events (walking around in the dark, false endings). What should be noted is that the cheap imitations that have followed (some good such as Predator, some bad such as The Relic), as well as the much more intense sequel Aliens have undermined the much more subtle terrors of the original. It has to be said that as terrific as Aliens is, it is a far more accessible and immediate film than Alien. This is not necessarily a bad thing, its just that this does not do Alien many favours, especially for those who may have seen Aliens first and hoped for an original of equal intensity. The truth is is that Alien is just as intense, but in different ways. Whilst Aliens form of terror puts you in the middle of a full-scale war, Alien prefers to leave you lost in a maze-like house with a monster chasing after you.<br/><br/>Like Blade Runner, Alien should be watched alone, and with full concentration paid to it. The rewards are many: predictably, it looks absolutely brilliant, with atmospheric, stunning use of lighting (see Captain Dallas' descent into the vents to catch the alien). The music by Jerry Goldsmith is truly sinister and haunting, lending more drama and suspense to the proceedings. The acting is the most involved and believable of all of the Alien films, thanks to a very good script, though Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, whilst still a great performance, doesn't really develop truly until the sequel.<br/><br/>All this adds up to a masterpiece of tension and technical excellence, as well as character and story pace. Credit to James Cameron for taking the sequel to a different level and not attempting a re-run of the original because in its field, Alien is peerless."

","In 1979 Alien made its appearance on the silver screen. However most fans of the film that were not at the Premiere showing do not realize that they missed The Real ALIEN. Selected theaters throughout the country were allowed to show a full un-cut version of the film that contained numerous scenes that were not released on later showings. The scenes created an almost unbearable amount of tension and fear. Scenes that show the Alien head and extended tongue appearing out of a total black background and then slowing withdrawing back into total darkness while the crew is searching for it. The studio, wanting to tone down the film for general consumption, deliberately removed scenes like these. It was thought that in its original state the movie was to powerful and would have a negative effect of sales.<br/><br/>Some months later after the sales slowed down the movie was brought back to the theaters and advertised as ""See Alien with scenes never before seen."" Unfortunately we may never see the Real Alien film."

","I remember seeing this film when I was very young.  I was around six years old and my mean babysitter brought it over on video to watch.  I had never seen anything like it before.  It was my first ""R""-rated movie!  I was truly terrified but I kept wanting to see the Alien and what it would do.  I never cried during the film...well, not until I went to bed.  The graphic, gory death scenes and horriffic screams and sounds in this film make it one of the most frightening films in motion picture history.  Today I absolutely love this film, simply because it still scares me!  Sigourney Weaver was brilliant.  This is still her best role in my book.  Many believe James Cameron's sequel is the best film of the series.  To me, it's the second best.  Alien rules!

","Alien is a splendid work, bristling, however, with unexplained pre-histories. This has enabled the film to survive nearly 20 years of friendly [and unfriendly] comment, but it has also served to whet the considerable appetites of its devotees. The origin of the monster was [and has never been] not explained and its eerie and compelling life cycle has eluded definitive analysis. The creature in this film was so appallingly frightening, particularly in its ""chest burster"" and ""adult"" incarnations, that subsequent titles have been robbed of the carnivorous manifestations of this exquisite being. The character ensemble, with their informal chatter and their humanly territorial imperatives, gave the human victims an authenticity in the face of almost insuperable danger that the normal ""creature feature"" or ""slasher"" would almost certainly lack. Perhaps the film's greatness lies in the fact that the dark pools of suggestion, with their limitless depths, conveyed a gripping horror that no subsequent viewing of it how many] can allay."

Ian Holm is absolutely chilling as the science officer Ash, and the sequence in which Parker (Yaphet Kotto, one of the most underrated actors of our time) and Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) confront the alien is brilliant.  Cartwright in particular gets the human-in-the-alien's-headlights look just perfect--her eyes get incredibly wide and her body just locks into place.

Another reason that makes this movie perfect is the fact that it reminds me of the place and of the period I first watched it. I was 13 then and I was in Lesvos (a Greek island).

Little did I know just how frightening the actual movie would be!<br/><br/>""Alien""'s story-line has more to do with the old sci-fi film ""It!  The Terror from Beyond Space"", about an alien who sneaks aboard a spaceship and terrorizes its passengers.  Of course, there's light-years difference between Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan and this beast.  <br/><br/>The plot remains the same, save for more modern tweaks and advances in technique.  And the actors herein are all in peak form.  Starting with the ever-radiant Weaver and continuing with Skeritt, Kotto, Stanton, Hurt, Holm and Cartwright, everyone does a fantastic job under the carefully-wrought direction of Scott, modulating terror and amazement at once as the alien gets aboard ship, terrorizing, attacking and destroying all in its path. <br/><br/>
It would be unfair to divulge more than that, as this is less a film than an experience; one best left to be witnessed in a pitch-black room with a pillow clutched tightly in your arms.  If you are a serious fan of sci-fi and/or horror, this is the film for your collection.  <br/><br/>There are so many great scenes, classic moments and downright wonderment with outer space along with the terror of the situation that ""Alien"" is rightly considered a landmark in the realms of sci-fi and, as other reviewers have noted, stands the test of time.  <br/><br/>As for myself, I'll take this film over any of its latter-day rip-offs any day.<br/><br/>Ten stars and a bronzed Face-Hugger for ""Alien"", a classic example of just what a bad alien can do, especially in the last twenty minutes of this film.<br/><br/>Talk about a bonus situation."

","I absolutely love this movie. From the great plot, to the  slowly growing tension, to the great acting, this film is a masterpiece in itself that is not to be missed.<br/><br/>The ship Nostromo is moving quite well through the galaxy, the crew in deep slumber. They are then awoken by the contact of a planet (I think, I don't remember), and they investigate. One crew member is attacked by a face-hugging creature, and it seems as if he will be okay, until that night, during dinner. A baby alien rips out of his stomach and flees (in a sort of funny scene) and hides out in the ship, waiting to attack. The remainder of the crew, scared and unsure, go about finding this thing, and as it begins to kill, it starts to grow, bigger and bigger, until it is a human-sized creature, and able to rip prey apart in seconds. As it does, over and over, until Ellen Ripley is left to battle it and escape with her life.<br/><br/>This really is a great movie. Sigourney Weaver has a hell of a lot of talent, and she displays it quite well in this. She truly is one of the best heroines of the horror genre, along with Marilyn Burns (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Eaten Alive) and Jamie Lee Curtis. She's tough, smart, and has a great scream. (Especially in the end, during the final battle with the alien in the escape pod.) The ending ten or fifteen minutes are tense, without a doubt, with dark, narrow tunnels and loud noises and blowing steam. My favorite scene is when Ripley is trying to override the detonation of the ship. That is the single most suspenseful scene in the movie, because Mother is counting down the time, and the process's steps are taking too long, and when, inevitably, time runs out, Ripley has the best reaction. (Smashing a computer consul and screaming to Mother, ""You bitch!!"")<br/><br/>
I don't need to even say that I recommend this movie. You know you have to see this movie, if you haven't. I have yet see Aliens (why, I don't know!!) but I can't wait, especially for the ""Get away from her, you bitch!"" scene, which I did see, and loved."

","It has been ten years since I saw ""Alien"" last -- I'm much more familiar with the sequel which I watch at least two times a year. What I remember thinking the first time I saw this film, back in the 80s, is that it was boring. Well, that was a little unfair, but I was just thirteen or something like that and sitting through a movie like this wasn't exactly what I enjoyed. I enjoy ""Alien"" more now, but even though I don't find it boring anymore, I can't help but feel that it is nothing compared to James Cameron's ""Aliens"". For instance, ""Alien"" is not nearly as suspenseful as Cameron's film, the action sequences are lamer (can't blame Scott for that, though, since his film is seven years older than Cameron's), and generally much more happens in the sequel. I also feel that the chemistry between the actors in ""Aliens"" are better than in this film. Naturally, though, ""Alien"" is much better than David Fincher's third instalment in the series (and he went on to make ""Fight Club"", wow!) and also way better than the fourth instalment. In short: it is a good film, but as far as the series go, this is definitely one of those rare cases where the sequel is actually better than the first film!"

Sure, ''Aliens'' was really great, but it was more of an non-stop actionmovie, ''Alien 3'' was the boring part, and ''Alien Ressurection'' was a bit better, and way more entertaining.

I mean, who ever would have thought of a knock-out bod, and bode of a body that could take out a grurome, all-teeth-showing alien."

","For 1979, this is 1 of the best sci-fi films ever, followed by a much better sequel then a sucky 3rd one then a awesome 4th one. The alien effects were great & not computerized like in the 3rd one. the cast especially Weaver does a superb job. the music is haunting 2. this is a must have if u r a sci-fi fan."

","I've seen many horror films, but something about Alien by a brief advertisment that just show ""An Egg and words In Space No one can hear you Scream"", that was it, but it was enough to hook me.  When I first saw the movie at a wide screen theater, the tension was  so great, I actually sat on the end of the seat<br/><br/>Missed the part of the Alien popped out the man's chest, for some reason I and many fellow men, just had to take a break and walk out in the lobby to relieve the tension. I wasn't prepared for the main character to be killed, for not only did I jump completely out my seat, it was unheard of for known actor to get killed. My only disappointment after reading the book, ""why did'nt they try more to kill the thing"", well all was brought out in the book, and Ripley Scott, gave his reason for deleting those scenes.  I do like Aliens better, but nothing could explain the initial fear of the first one.  I highly recommend seeing this film."

","I rented this film last week.I hadn't seen it in about ten years.The effects and suspence are great.The charcters are real people not cutouts like in its inferior sequels.The film is more horror than anything else.I was surprised at how good the effects were for 1979.Ripley is the first female action hero. The director does a good job with his angles.There are some strange shots though. 11 out of 10.A rating for all the film."
"allenone75","Null","0","1","3 March 2000"," The best in Science Fiction films
","This is realistic Science Fiction; arguing about bonus shares over coffee and cigarettes in space.  If we start mining asteroids the people who go out there and do it will probably be like the characters from this movie.  It's not only terrifying it's realistic. We don't see a polished, gleaming spaceship we see a giant factory complete with dripping water, chains, equipment scattered here and there.  It's human progress like we know it, good but not always pretty.  And the Alien spaceship was incredible, especially since the movie didn't bend over backwards trying to explain it. You're left to speculate.<br/><br/>Some of the best scenes:<br/><br/>The Alien ship:  Dallas looking into the eye of the Alien Captain, turning away, and the camera focusing on the skull for a second in the darkness. Chilling.<br/><br/>The Dinner scene:  One of the top-ten sci-fi moments.<br/><br/>The conversations of Parker and Brett:   How the interstellar laborer views management.  Way to develop the characters.<br/><br/>Brett looking for Jones:  Scary<br/><br/>Dallas in the shafts:  Even scarier, especially with the music.<br/><br/>Ripley and the alien:  'Nuff said."
"Indy-52","7","0","1","22 February 2000"," one of the best old scary movies
","there were many scary movies made in the seventies that today are considered classics (e.g. Jaws, Halloween, Piranha, and ripoffs & sequels). Unfortunately i wasn't born in that decade, so i couldn't see anyone of these movies, i've only seen them on the small screen. One of my favorite movies of all time was Jaws, and i still think that that movie deserves the title of ""best scary movie of the 70's"". But, after lately seeing Alien, which many people have told me was a good movie, i think it is a good runner-up. I actually had seen Aliens, the sequel first, which was good. Although, after seeing this one, that movie looks much worse. While Aliens was okay, good, Alien is excellent, great! I know that many people think exactly the opposite, but these people are definitely wrong. It also shows because Alien is actually listed higher in the top 250. Alien was definitely scarier, while Aliens is more of an action/war flick. It was also far too loud and dumb and the action would often get boring. This never gets boring, even if there are scenes where nothing happens. It has great music and excellent set design, it really doesn't look old. <br/><br/>I really understand why they call it a masterpiece!"

","Alien A-/A 2.12.00 2.35:1/5.1 Previously Viewed Anamorphic Widescreen THX<br/><br/>This movie has definitely held up after 20 years.  Unlike Scott's own Blade Runner, the action and sets look just about as good as anything in the last few years (save The Phantom Menace).  And where Blade Runner on DVD looked and sounded awful, Alien has gotten the full treatment.  Anamorphic transfer, 5.1 THX sound, gobs of deleted scenes, director's comments and lots of other goodies.  A first rate movie and DVD."
"Bry-20","Null","0","1","5 February 2000"," Great!
","This is my favorite horror movie. Some people don't consider it a horror film, but it is in my book. The creature is such a scary and savage creature, that when I saw (spoiler alert!) the thing pop out to kill Dallas (end of spoiler) I couldn't sleep for weeks. This is no alien that has bug-sized eyes and carries a raygun. I liked the characters, they are not soldiers ready to take on the threat, they are people that can be your girlfriend or your next door neighbor. The directing by Ridley Scott is excellent. The music in the film really helps the theme of the movie, its really eerie. Overall, its a great film the no one should miss."
"danny-60","10","0","1","4 February 2000"," A real horror movie
","Why horror movies like this are no longer made? The last time I really got fear at the cinema or at home was with movies like Alien, The Shining, Rosemary's Baby, etc. I wonder if now it only counts terror movies whose main characters are teenagers, their soundtracks are extremely overwhelming and carelessly mix horror with humor. Enough!, I hope pure terror movies are made again, with a lot of fear and intrigue. I don't know if The Sixth Sense will fulfill my expectations next Saturday."
"Rainfox","Null","0","1","6 February 2000"," In space no one can hear you scream
","* * * * * (5 out of 5)<br/><br/>Alien <br/><br/>Directed by : Ridley Scott, 1979<br/><br/>Claustrophobic and effective horror favorite; still a shot in the arm to the whole genre. <br/><br/>Alien is a scary watch for even the most convinced horror fanatic. Standard 1950s formula (with touches of Kubrick`s 2001), but done with such flair and vision that it became an instant classic. <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver delivers a top performance, as does John Hurt and Tom Skerritt, but the real winner is director and designer Ridley Scott who creates an environment so compelling and spellbinding it would not only spawn three sequels but be considered an institution to this very day.<br/><br/>
The alien design was created by artist H.R. Giger and is legendary by itself.<br/><br/>Note : The art direction, cinematography and sound editing was revolutionary, as was the camera angles and barren and bleak vision of the future. Must remember to mention that the movie boldly had a woman as the main character, another plus for this genre that only added to Alien's credibility. The movie also went against mainstream as lead characters were randomly killed, and this naturally only adding to the suspense (a technique later copied in such diverse thrillers as Shoot To Kill, 1988, and Deep Blue Sea, 1999)."
"gold712","8","0","1","30 January 2000"," THE BEST IN THE SERIES!!!
","This first film is by far the best in the series. It has everything: great acting, a beautiful musical score, exciting suspense, astounding special effects, superb filming, and so much more. <br/><br/>Alien was a breakthrough for 1979. Many people think Aliens was better, but you can't beat the first. This is one of the greatest thrillers ever made in science fiction. <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver gives a show-stopping performance as Ellen Ripley. Yaphet Kotto does extremely well also, as does Tom Skerrit and Ian Holm.<br/><br/>
Alien is a film we will never forget!<br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10"
"Kai-18","Null","0","1","1 January 2000"," A first rate thriller in the vein of It! the Terror from Beyond Space and the Thing
","Styled after those 2 great 50's films the fear factor is doubled and the gore factor is a lot bigger.  Though the ""Alien Birth"" scene wasn't as graphic as I expected it certainly was incredibly gross.  Ripley is a strong female character in this film.  I hear in the original cut she dies and the Alien contacts Earth using her voice.  Don't watch this alone in the dark. Great scare flick."
