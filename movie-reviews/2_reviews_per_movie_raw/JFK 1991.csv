","The assassination of JFK has been told in every possible way through every available medium. Oliver Stone managed the unimaginable transforming and almost folk tragedy, through a mix of drama and cinema verit√®, into a riveting mystery thriller with the paranoiac style of a man who's in touch with paranoia in a quasi permanent basis. Unnerving, frustrating and spectacularly satisfying. Kevin Costner manages to be convincing as the center piece of the conspiracy theory. We believe the whole damn thing because we see it through his logic. Sissy Spacek, as his wife, represents most us and she does it brilliantly. Tommy Lee Jones and Kevin Bacon are a pleasure to watch. Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and even John Candy, Sally Kirkland and Vincent D'Onofrio deliver little parts of the puzzle without ever becoming distracting. Gary Oldman is a chilling dead ringer for Lee Harvey Oswald. For film lovers, for history nuts, for pop culture fanatics and for conspiracy theorists, this is a must."
"Strangef8","Null","188","259","3 July 2004"," Past the controversy
","In the time since I first saw the film ""JFK"", I have found myself inexplicably drawn to the events in Dallas, TX on November 22, 1963. I have researched online and in libraries to learn the truth of these events, and I would say that my outlook on those matters has changed substantially. But underneath that, and the controversy that developed from it, there is one universal and almost indisputable truth regarding the film: JFK is simply an excellent movie. And no difference of opinion can refute this.<br/><br/>I have seen my fair share of films over the years, I'm not a cinema maniac by any means. But I think I can judge a quality product when I see one and that's simply what this picture presents. It is, as Tom Wicker of the New York Times said at it's release, propaganda; but the same can be said for every film by Michael Moore... of whom I'm NOT a fan... but they are still strong pictures. <br/><br/>JFK runs the difficult task of presenting fact, fiction, conjecture and opinion, twisting them all to present the increasingly difficult to dispute conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone (and according to director Oliver Stone, did not act) in the assassination of President Kennedy. <br/><br/>The films accomplishments though, past this controversial thesis, are many: 1.) Kevin Costner turns in one of the greatest performances of his career. While his accent is stronger than Garrison and the physical resemblance not astonishing, Costner three dimensionalizes a character and lives in it throughout the film. <br/><br/>2.) An impressive and versatile cast is used superbly. The film is loaded with quality stars such as Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones (in an Oscar nominated role), Gary Oldman, and Joe Pesci (who share an intense and crucial scene); as well as character actors and actresses such as Michael Rooker, Sissy Spacek, and Jay Saunders. Stone even navigates a dramatic turn from the late comedy great John Candy and utilizes Hollywood legends Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Donald Sutherland superbly.<br/><br/>3.) With the possible exception of the lone gunman theory, every possibility of truth is explored, at least in dialogue. Because the case has never been fully elaborated on no one can say for certain what the truth is; Stone presents all views while advancing his theory.<br/><br/>4.) The film is a masterwork of editing. It won the Oscar for film editing in 1991, and deserved it. I once read in Entertainment Weekly that a normal film has roughly 200 cuts in it; there are more than sixty in the opening minutes alone here. Even more impressive when you consider the variety of film used. <br/><br/>JFK is not absolute fact, it does not truly pretend to be. By Stone's own admission, Laurie Metcalf, Michael Rooker, and Kevin Bacon play composites or dramatized characters, not the real thing. But standing alone as a movie, JFK is untouchably excellent. And if it does force you to question, as Costner's Garrison asks in the closing moments ""of what is our government made?"", then it's all for the better."
"Casa2000","Null","259","369","9 March 1999"," One of the best and most important films ever made!
","Oliver Stone's epic film which follows the real-life events of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison is a monumental movie event.  It should have been named the Best Picture of 1991 instead of The Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is perfect and it shows that when an intriguing story comes together with all other elements of filmmaking that are executed brilliantly, the film works on so many levels.<br/><br/>First off, Stone's direction is as good as it gets.  He has an incredible passion for the subject, knowledge of the art and relationship with the camera.  All of his footage goes together seamlessly and makes the 3 h 08 min running time blow by.  He gets a strong performance out of the entire ensemble cast especially Costner, Jones, Oldman, and Pesci.<br/><br/>Scalia and Hutsching's editing is a work of art and tells the complicated story with incredible precision.  Richardson's cinematography lights up the screen in both colour and black and white.  Both of these technical aspects of filmmaking are molded into sheer artistry by these three men who have all deserved their Oscars for this film.<br/><br/>John Williams' score is one of his best (right up there with his Indiana Jones and Star Wars).  The script is intelligent, thought-provoking, mesmorizing and heart-wrenching.  Costner's closing speech to the Jury is finer that Nicholson's in A Few Good Men, McConaughey's in A Time to Kill and Jackson's in Pulp Fiction.  It is Stone and Sklar's best work.<br/><br/>The subject matter is incredibly controverial and subjective but Stone's delivers it with such emotion and raw power that his alternate myth to the Warren Report seems factual.  The film is an investigation into the human spirit and how the vigour and dedication of one man and his team of associates can rise above the highest powers of the world and encode a message into the minds and hearts of millions.  John F. Kennedy has countless achievements and qualities as a president which makes his life and term one of the most incredible and worthy of deep study.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's JFK should go down in film history as one of the most important American films ever produced.  Watch it with an open mind free of prejudice and predisposition and you will find yourself wanting to go to the library and learn more about this global tragedy."
"BobStage","10","112","154","1 December 2007"," Oliver Stone's greatest film!!!
","I have stated many times that Oliver Stone is an incredible film maker whose films sizzle with excellent cinematography, good acting, and original storyline. He makes controversial films that are sometimes unappreciated by the public and the critics. I said and believed all this even before I watched ""JFK"".<br/><br/>""JFK"" is a film that stars many A-list actors in major and minor roles, but they give deep imprints nonetheless. Tommy Lee Jones, the Oscar nominated actor of the film, gives a performance that I almost missed due to my not recognizing him. Jones plays Clay Shaw, a powerful figure in New Orleans and a secret homosexual who knew about the plot to kill the president. Gary Oldman is fantastic as the widely publicized murderer, Lee Harvey Oswald. Joe Pesci, fresh from his Oscar in ""Goodfellas"", as Dave Ferrie, a man who is struggling to cope with the heavy accusations and mysteries of the JFK murder. Donald Sutherland in an Oscar-worthy performance, as an informant that talks to Jim Garrison, played wonderfully by Kevin Costner. Other great appearances include Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Michael Rooker, and even Walter Matthau in a bit appearance.<br/><br/>Many of these fine performances were worthy of Oscars, but if there is one man that deserved an Oscar more than anyone else, it would have to be Oliver Stone, who did not win Best Director OR Best Picture. Who did he lose to? ""Silence of the Lambs"". While I do consider the film to be an excellent thriller featuring one of Anthony Hopkins' greatest performances, I must say that in terms of scope and daring, ""JFK"" was a far superior film. The cinematography was far more varied and ambitious, as well as the subject matter itself. I can understand why ""JFK"" was passed over, but the reasons are not fair to the extraordinary film given to us.<br/><br/>The appearance of ""JFK"" is astounding. You are taken to a time of much distrust, horror, confusion, corruption, and cover-up. The murders of JFK, Martin Luther King, and RFK all influenced the time periods and the peoples. Many people tried not to think about it, or else they were scared into silence. Some, like Jim Garrison, tried to present the truth of ""JFK"", and their efforts are being felt even now.<br/><br/>Before I saw this film, I had seen Oliver comment that ""JFK"" was a movie in which he got all the crazy theories and presented them. He was not implying that everything was true, and some of it isn't true. But after seeing this film, I am convinced there was definitely more to the story than was originally told, as I believed even before I saw ""JFK"". This gave me a knowledge of the period, and awareness of the people participating in the drama of the time.<br/><br/>The point of the film is not entirely based on the story of the JFK assassination. It is an outcry from Oliver Stone to remind us that truth is never simple, nor is it always presented by the government. People must struggle to find the truth sometimes, and if it is covered up, it could be lost forever. The film is an attempt to show us that the murder of President Kennedy was a time of much confusion and mix-up. So what was true and what was not? Many eye-witnesses gave conflicted views, while other circumstances were strange in their origins and happening. And while he gave us this, Oliver Stone also presented us with the best film that he has yet made, and his resume is incredible as it is.<br/><br/>I have seen the films ""Platoon"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July"": films that Oliver Stone won Best Director for. Why did he not win for ""JFK""? Why did it only win 2 Oscars? For me, it is another example of how disappointing the Oscar results can be. I urge all to see this epic film of mystery and deceit, of truth and lies, the work of a master film director known as Oliver Stone."
"ElMaruecan82","10","54","72","18 September 2012"," No matter how ugly a truth is, it is never uglier than its absence ...
","On the field of storytelling, ""JFK"" reminds of Costa Gavras' ""Z"", a political thriller meticulously deconstructing a politician's murder in a fictional Fascist country. Yet it owes more to Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" which presented one reality from as many angles as levels of subjectivity. It's interesting that these films, all one-word titled, were made in the same intervals of time and like ""Rashomon"" and ""Z"", ""JFK"" is less a name than a code that encapsulates behind the mystery and the patriotic mask, a more universal truth about humanity.<br/><br/>Still, patriotism is seriously involved and it's very significant that Oliver Stone, one of America's most prolific political film-makers, much more a Vietnam vet, handled the subject of Kennedy's assassination. As a man who practiced America's ideals on a muddy battlefield, Stone is entitled to question these values he fought for and the integrity of the leaders that sent him out there: indeed, why would America send soldiers to fight foreigners in Vietnam? Why so far when Cuba is so close? <br/><br/>Money is the key. There are no warmongers but businessmen who generate money out of all the steel, the guns, the helicopters, the machines that are blown to pieces in Asia. In fact, Stone didn't make a Vietnam and a President trilogy but a colossal oeuvre about Politics and War. And to a certain extent, Kennedy can be regarded as one of the Vietnam War's victims, as a collateral damage: he was against the conflict and got killed before putting an end to it. It doesn't point an accusing finger on the Army, but it highlights at least one serious motive for Kennedy's assassination.<br/><br/>And that's the essence of the investigation lead by District Attorney Garrison, Kevin Costner at the peak of his bank-ability. Garrison isn't satisfied with the conclusions of the Warren Commission that validated the ""isolated killer"" theory, incarnated by Lee Harvey Oswald (a remarkable Gary Oldman) who conveniently died before his trial. What was his motive anyway? The Commission closed the case, leaving a bunch of altered testimonies, witnesses silenced before exposing their truth and so many unanswered questions. Garrison smells something fishy and who wouldn't? And the compass to guide his investigation is the elementary question: who benefits from the crime? <br/><br/>And this is where Kennedy's assassination takes a sort of legendary aura, playing as a modern version of Julius Caesar. Kennedy could have made a lot of enemies everywhere: CIA, Russia, Cubans, although I wouldn't regard it as an omission, the film didn't even mention the possibility of an involvement from the Federal Reserve Bank since Kennedy always defended the sovereignty of the dollar. But as the film progresses, it gets clearer that Kennedy was a man to eliminate, and one of ""JFK""'s highlights (which is saying a lot) is carried by the revelations delivered by Donald Sutherland as Mr. X, in Washington.<br/><br/>There are two levels in ""JFK"", the mystery surrounding the murder and the investigation, what happened and what is known. And both interact in a masterstroke of editing, probably one of the most complicated, intricate and brilliant ever committed to screen, certainly a school-case for wannabe editors. Literally, ""JFK"" is served like a salad of documents, flashbacks, excerpts from the Zapruder film, archive footage, memories, truths and lies, shot in every possible way (sepia, 16mm, amateur, black and white) and as Roger Ebert pointed out, the film would have been harder to follow with an unchanging shooting. The salad is rich but digestible.<br/><br/>And like a 1000-piece puzzle, ""JFK"" is an assemblage of different portions of reality that tend to get Garrison, if not closer to the 'final image', further from the Warren's conclusions. On that level, the film provides an extraordinary cast of supporting characters, from Jack Lemmon to Joe Pesci, from Kevin Bacon to John Candy, each one leading to one certainty: there was a conspiracy. The analysis of the Zapruder film revealed the timing between the first and last shot, making implausible the 'one-killer' hypothesis, even if he's a sharpshooter. And this very implausibility implies the presence of a second person, which is enough to validate the idea of a conspiracy.<br/><br/>And last but not least, there's the excitability of some interrogated people who know that they put their lives at stakes if they talk. The film is driven by a sense of paranoia that conveys its greatest thrills. What can be more emotionally engaging than a quest for truth anyway, especially when it undermines the deepest beliefs of any good citizen? One of Garrison's employees, played by Michael Rooker, can't accept the possibility of Johnson's involvement, even Garrison's wife (Sissy Spacek) represent this side of America that wants to turn the page. Garrison has detractors and it starts in his own private circle, before he becomes a target for the media.<br/><br/>Garrison embodies the struggle of a man who wants to reconcile with America's ideals, he doesn't fight the government because he's against it, but because the government acts against the people. He feels like owing this to Kennedy, to his vision of America, to his sons, and as his investigation goes on, he witnesses the deaths of Martin Luther King, of Bobby Kennedy, and realizes that the system that killed Kennedy still prevails. Garrison's struggle is magnificently conveyed by the sort of inspirational score that only John Williams could have performed.<br/><br/>""JFK"" works on every cinematic level, it's one of the best political films and best conspiracy movies ever made because it doesn't try to tell its own truth but to belie a fallacious version. It starts with an axiom: there was a conspiracy, and as long as it won't be solved, there's an emotional wound in America's heart that would never be healed."
"dustbrother204","10","142","204","11 January 2003"," A Stunningly Well Planned and Articulated Film
","Oliver Stone is undoubtedly one of the most controversial directors of all time, his work has included horrifyingly real stories of Vietnam, stories of the corruption of politics and a much-despised account of Jim Morrison's life. No matter the subject matter, Stone always gives it his all and sometimes the world's response is positive and sometimes it's negative. With JFK we are faced with one of his films that was probably one of his most successful (next to Platoon of 1986). This is a rare instance in which the public loved the concept of conspiracy in their own country, and took special interest in the debates that it caused amongst the government upon release. The best thing about this film is that it is and was treated as so much more than a film. My honest opinion is that this response was created not because of a more plausible theory but because of Stone's fantastic and unique job putting the story together.<br/><br/>The film opens on a surprisingly suspenseful scene of the murder of John F. Kennedy. The chopped style of the scene lets you know that something is not right, dramatic black and white shots spliced with the blurry grain shots of the home video taken by a witness (it won Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography). This, accompanied by John Williams' excellent original score helped do an excellent job of creating a mood, just for this very first scene. Often times a director will stop after this, give it his all for style and then stop after the first scene, but Stone doesn't do this. He makes the film so much more than a boring investigation; he takes you in to each of the puzzle pieces  (indeed, it feels like you're with Kevin Costner ""digging"" through hundreds of events.) For 90% of these clips that lace the film's concepts together, the camera is not kept steady, it is, indeed, like you are there witnessing it. The human eye doesn't only look at what is important, and a situation of trauma can make everything seem broken, confused. Oliver Stone doesn't try to make sure you understand what's going on. Some frown upon this, but it's realistic and that's what counts.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the district attorney of New Orleans who investigates the murder of John Kennedy. Sometimes you are expected to disagree (at first) with some of Garrison's presumptuous statements, and when you do there is always at least one character around who will agree with you. Stone realizes most viewers aren't devoted enough to believe everything Garrison says no matter what it is throughout the film. Stone has said that he wants people to ""rethink history"" and that this film is not guaranteed fact, but an ""alternate myth"" to the myth that has been presented before. The story is not solid because very few ideas or people or events in life are. What I mean to say is that Garrison's comments are not necessarily ridiculous, it's just a matter of how hard he tries to support them. The focus constantly changes -- yes, Costner will smile a bit when he makes a ridiculous remark that everyone rolls their eyes at, yes, even at the end of the film some clips will be left unchecked, and yes, you will see that there is no way that the question ""who killed JFK"" is answered as simply, solidly, and, dare I say it, Hollywood-esquely as a one man killing. If you watch this movie looking for real life, without dramatization and without guaranteed entertainment and fun, you will be impressed. This is not a popcorn movie.<br/><br/>And finally a word should be said about the actors' enhancement of the realism of the film. Most notable are Joe Pesci as the frantic David Ferrie who pretends to be a victim but truly (we see) had much more to do with it than he pretends (although convincingly was not an assassin -- he blows the whole thing out of proportion ""this is too f*cking big for you, you know that?"") and Tommy Lee Jones as the wry ring leader Claw Shaw, who seems to be a pompous upscale member of society that has been doing the dark business of conspiracy behind closed doors. The fact that these characters can appear real to us and not just appear as familiar actors taking on a role (as you might feel in Ocean's Eleven) truly does the film justice in driving it forward.<br/><br/>This is in fact one of my top three favorite movies, but I tend to refrain from mentioning it as just this to my friends-- I'm sooner to mention Memento or Fight Club. The reason for this is that the movie is almost an acquired taste, and certainly not normal entertainment for a teenager. It's honestly written for a generation above me, but everything that makes it (up to and including the ""kings are killed"" and other political themes) are intriguing to me, and for me anything intriguing grows to be a favorite. Even if the subject is not something that ever really impacted me, I take themes to heart, and I always love a good ""enigma wrapped in a riddle.""<br/><br/>NOTES: -Maybe a point off for being inconsistent in goal. Though as admirable in a movie as any other characteristic, I found this to be the most restricting on ability to follow along. -Also notable is the fact that it's very release sparked opening of sealed governmental records on the subject.<br/><br/>OVERALL: A+"

","JFK is a movie that always frustrates me. I am not frustrated because it is bad or the historical inaccuracies people point out. Rather because it's so good it always angers me how underrated this masterpiece is. This of course did receive generally good reviews with a 83% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 72 Metascore, I think this deserves more than just ""generally favorable reviews"". Many trash this movie which I, with all due respect, don't get why. If you haven't seen this movie I demand you to stop reading this review, get up the couch and go buy this movie right now.<br/><br/>
As you can guess from the very ""creative"" title, this movie is about the investigation of the JFK assassination centering district attorney Jim Garrison played by Kevin Costner. This movie is even speaking visually a masterpiece. The editing is excellent using both black & white and color masterfully to create this sense of mystery. The performances are all excellent with the obvious ones being Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones who give unforgettable performances, and the score of course is phenomenal. But what makes this movie so wonderful is how this it is perfectly written. If there is a way to describe this movie, it is that the conspiracy gets uglier as it gets going. What I mean by that is first the film starts with a pretty simple well known hypothesis that Oswald actually did not kill Kennedy. But as the three hour runtime proceeds, the conspiracy gets as big as the involvement of LBJ and the White House. As the facts get presented you can see how the truth is uglier than what we know from the Warren commission, and how there is a bigger power preventing us from knowing the truth. At the climax of the movie, Oliver Stone challenges us, ""Is the justice system we live in really practice justice?"" This is a movie that we all want to ignore to avoid the most shameful truth of our justice system, but as Americans we must face this and question the system we currently have.<br/><br/>
Overall this is a terrific movie that is very criminally overlooked. I honestly can't understand why this is not on the IMDb top 250 in a world where Hachi: A Dog's tale and a bunch of Bollywood musicals can make it in. This is a perfect example that IMDb overlook real masterpieces like this one and are just obsessed with Indian movies (Like seriously! Why is IMDb obsessed with Indian movies!). Though I don't give a lot of these, I give this one a 10/10 and a A+. It is very unfortunate the maximum rating is 10/10 in IMDb, since if there is no limitations I would rate this a 20/10."

","""JFK"" was and remains so controversial that any positive reviews (not to say they were characteristic) it received were dwarfed by the trashing to which it was subjected in the official press, which started well before it was released.  This was disturbing, for what is the big need -- it is just a movie.  But to so many ""JFK"" was not, it was somehow threatening.<br/><br/>
Ultimately, it does not matter whether JFK's conclusion is correct, and I am even willing to give a little more license than I normally would to more-substantive, as well as less-important, inaccuracies, although I have my limits here too.   But this movie's significance is just that it was made.  For although other films had chronicled the events surrounding the assassination, none had in any substantial way sought to discredit the Warren Commission, as was so absolutely merited.<br/><br/>Regardless of your opinion on what really happened, it is my view that everyone should be critical of the media, which were so obsequious to the Warren Commission.  The New York Times from the start referred to Oswald as the ""assassin,"" not the ""suspect.""    Life Magazine altered photos strongly suggesting a shot had been fired from the grassy knoll.   Many years later, when being interviewed by Dan Rather about his film, Oliver Stone said to his face, referring to the event:  ""Where were you, Dan?""<br/><br/>
Indeed, in a documentary he made, Rather said, ""in the absence of any CREDIBLE evidence, we can only...""  This fallacy is a betrayal of the legal definition of evidence, with Rather's poor characterization of the word ""credible.""  There is enormous, indeed endless, evidence contradicting the Warren Commission's view, and much of it is certainly credible, including all the evidence of the Commission's own efforts to conduct a dishonest and incomplete investigation and intimidate witnesses into changing their testimony to support the version it wanted.  In fact, I consider it Gerald Ford's greatest character flaw that he served on it and backed its conduct and conclusion, a far more disturbing matter than his pardon of Nixon. Whether the evidence to which Rather referred is CONCLUSIVE is another story; that is up to us, the jury.  The sort of smugness Rather shows has been characteristic of much of the media, and I do not know all the reasons they behaved as they did.  Thus, we needed a more courageous, enterprising person like Oliver Stone to step in and fill the gap -- the overwhelming majority of people believe the Commission got it wrong.<br/><br/>Stone's enlistment of mere hypotheticals, theorized by Garrison (setting aside the final scene--there were moments before) or whoever, has been subjected to unfair, ill-conceived criticism.  Most people who knew anything at all about the assassination believed there were problems with the Commission's version before they saw this film, and came out of it with an elaboration and hypothesis, not a mindbender.  Even if we concede that some younger viewers knew little about the assassination, the notion of the critics of ""JFK"" that the film would automatically program their minds is an insult to their intelligence, of the ability of people in general to think and come to their own conclusions.  Indeed, no one to whom I have EVER spoken has betrayed a view of events that reflects even most, if not all, of Stone's conclusions.  If any programming is called for, it is to program people against the Commission's version, not, as its defenders would wish, against Stone.  For no one can be programmed to accept Stone's alternate view.<br/><br/>OK, some inaccuracies of Stone can be criticized, such as his portrayal of Garrison (All-American Kevin Costner, natch) as a wholesome hero, and the time-between-shots issue (it is now generally conceded that there was enough time, based on all the evidence, for Oswald to have done it, for those who believe he did).  Perhaps the speech by David Ferrie never occurred, but it still reflects the widely held view that the CIA and Mafia worked together in this matter.  Certainly, many people in the government despised Kennedy, and there were substantially more elements of this hostility than portrayed in the film.  Anyway, we can go on and on.  The Warren Commission tried to cover up overwhelming evidence that Ruby knew Oswald, that a shot was fired from the grassy knoll, that a dark-skinned man fired shots from the Dallas School Book Depository, and that Officer Tippit was killed by someone other than Oswald (actually, two people).  Well, at least some members resisted the single bullet theory (I guess that passes Rather's definition of ""credible""), although they ultimately signed the report.<br/><br/>I do not agree with Oliver Stone's specific ultimate conclusion about the central moving force of the assassination.   But he has the right to suggest the U.S. government was involved, and many, including myself, think it was involved somehow, but that what is debatable is merely to what extent and how far up.  Hats off to Stone for his courage and thoughtfulness in making his necessary statement.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","The first film in Oliver Stone's films about the American presidency, JFK is a historical drama exploring a popular conspiracy theory regarding John F. Kennedy's assassination, adapted from the books On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs. On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas, Texas, allegedly by Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman). The inciting incident occurs when New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison notices several inaccuracies in the Warren Report (the official investigation of the assassination) and decides to reexamine the case of Kennedy's death. Garrison and his team pursue the truth at all costs, and eventually take Kennedy's death to court to ask: who really is responsible for killing the President?<br/><br/>Clocking in at more than three hours, the film has a definite focus on its story, with every element of the film being used to further the plot. Garrison is a modern hero in the film, a city DA that rises to the enormous challenge of investigating the President's assassination. Kevin Costner seems to perfectly capture this type of character (also achieving a thick, charming southern accent) and connecting with the viewers. He is surrounded by an all-star supporting cast, all of which truly become the real life figures they portray. Stone writes believable and engaging dialogue, but since the film focuses so heavily on story, he spends little time developing the characters. Oliver Stone is a controversial director, and his style can be very polarizing, but personally, I enjoyed his strange method of storytelling. The costumes seemed appropriate for the setting, and the set designs were extraordinary, particularly the recreations of 1960s city streets such as Dallas and New Orleans.<br/><br/>John Williams was responsible for writing the film's score, and was nominated for an Oscar for his efforts. Williams was busy writing the score for Hook around the same time, so he actually wrote themes for the film before the film was shot. This resulted in Stone cutting and editing the film to the music, instead of the typical method of fitting the music to the film. Williams gives JFK a tragic, but heroic theme, but also incorporates pulsing synthesizers for the investigative scenes (an unusual tactic for the composer). This resulted in an effective score and a seamless integration with the film. The cinematography was unusual, but played a very important role in the story. The film opens with a montage of newsreel clips from JFK's presidency. It slowly intersperses Stone's own clips, but the lighting and coloring (black-and-white and grainy film) make the clips all seem genuine. Much of the film is shot in this manner, giving a very real sense to the story, very similar to a documentary. I can honestly say this film would not have been the same had it not been for this unique approach to cinematography.<br/><br/>JFK (rated R) contains strong language throughout, and the assassination scenes may be too graphic for young viewers. The 3-hour runtime will bore some; however, any lover of historical dramas or investigative thrillers will finish the film asking for more. The film is an emotional journey, and viewers will always find themselves rooting for Garrison and his seemingly impossible quest. I give this film a B+, finding it ""guilty"" of keeping me on the edge of my seat."

","Kevin Costner embodied this role as Jim Garrison and Oliver Stone directed everything about it masterfully! A very long winded 3 hours 25 minutes so really takes up time and well worth every bit of it. If you wanna understand the major conspiracy this is perfect for you; it redeems itself with vast info and sheds light on such a tragedy in which, in my opinion, many things went downhill after JFK was assassinated. Also Gary Oldman is among one of my favorite actors ever; always perfect as villain roles such as Lee Harvey Oswald! Cool how Joe Pesci is in this too as David Ferrie, he's great at using the F bomb excessively. Also the entire intermission with Donald Sutherland is perfection! Truly excellent political drama!"

","The assassination of American President John Kennedy is one of the most talked about events in American history so making a film about such a talked over event was going to be no easy task but Oliver Stone pulled it of perfectly and may just be the best film he's ever given us next to Platoon. This film has an extremely long runtime and there's nothing wrong with that as long as they use it to the films advantage and they do, the first 30 minutes of this film takes the time to explore the effects of the assassination, the reasons why it effected To so many people and sets up the main character and his motivations played perfectly by Kevin Costner. I truly think that this is the greatest performance Kevin Costner has ever given because he perfectly strikes a balance between his obsession with solving the assassination and his commitments to his family, the character is just so well written, you understood why he was so obsessed and was an easy person to get behind. Tommy Lee Jones gives a performance like we've never seen from him before, he was fantastic in this film, he was such a despicable character and was the perfect foil for the plot of this film. A very young Gary Oldman was also great in this film as Lee Harvey Oswald, he leaves a really big impression for the rest of the film to follow and when we start to learn more about Oswalds character, Oldmans performance remains consistent. This film could have been extremely boring because of the amount of information that it has to give out but it never is. The film takes entire sequences to add emotional weight to the assassination and the masterful editing in this film allowed us to take in the information better. I really liked the fact that Stone didn't paint the assassination as just an act of pure evil, we begin to understand why JFK was killed and while you never support them, you understand why the assassins chose to kill him and made the film much more interesting. Another thing I loved about this movie was the sub plot of Garrisons family, it added to Costners character as we begin to see that his obsession with this case is becoming unhealthy, yet through conversations with his children we begin to further understand his motives and was really heartwarming at times. <br/><br/>JFK is a masterpiece, it's engaging, never boring and extremely intriguing. While I'm not entirely sure if this film is completely accurate, it's probably somewhat close to the truth. It has fantastic performances, particularly that of Kevin Costner and may just be Stones best film. <br/><br/>100%/A+"

","JFK is a three hour film that examines the events leading to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and alleged subsequent cover- up, through the eyes of the late former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison - who filed charges against New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw for his alleged participation in a conspiracy to assassinate the President, for which Lee Harvey Oswald was found responsible by two Government investigations: the Warren Commission, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations that concluded that there was another assassin shooting with Oswald.<br/><br/>JFK was adapted by Stone and Zachary Sklar from the books On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs.It stars Kevin Costner,Gary Oldman,Kevin Bacon,Tommy Lee Jones together with Laurie Metcalf,Michael Rooker,Joe Pesci,Jay O. Sanders,Donald Sutherland,John Candy and Sissy Spacek with Martin Sheen acting as the narrator of the movie. It was directed by Oliver Stone.<br/><br/>The docudrama accounts the mystery behind the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.The brisk investigation of that murder conducted under the guidance of Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren distressed many observers, even though subsequent careful investigations have been unable to find much fault with the conclusions his commission drew, the central one of which was that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone. Instead of satisfying the public, one result of the Warren Commission Report was that an unimaginable number of plausible conspiracy theories were bruited about, and these have supported a sizable publishing mini-industry ever since. But New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison is convinced that there are some big flaws in the investigation of Oswald, and he sets out to recreate the events leading up to the assassination. Along the way, he stumbles across evidence that a great many people had reason to want to see the president killed, and he is convinced that some of them worked in concert to frame Oswald as the killer. Among the suspects are Lyndon Baines Johnson,the next president of the United States, the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover, and the Mafia. Over the course of gathering what he believes to be evidence of a conspiracy, Garrison unveils some of the grittier aspects of New Orleans society,focusing on the shady activities of Clay Shaw.Garrison's investigations culminate in his conducting a show trial that he knows he will lose and which he is sure will ruin his career in order to get his evidence into the public record where it can't be buried again.<br/><br/>In making this movie, Stone presented another theory that it was the conspiracy that involves the CIA who committed the crime of the assassination of the late President John Kennedy and what came out was one of the most compelling and controversial films ever to emerge from American cinema. The final film came out like a cinema masterpiece and an honest search for truth.The performances by Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones were phenomenal.Costner had a low-key but forceful portrayal of Garrison and nicely conveys the requisite grit,curiosity and fearlessness.While Jones exhibited a great complexity and emotion to the man behind Shaw.The direction was also superb as the movie was a great ride of both information and propaganda for three hours seemed quite short in this docudrama.<br/><br/>In the end,JFK is a must-see!!!!"

","Few events in American history stand out quite so heavily as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Besides the shocking nature of the event with the American president being gunned down in broad daylight in a major city came the psychic scars caused by unanswered questions due to an alleged assassin gunned down before he could ever be tried and an official investigation that was at best botched and, at worst, a whitewash. Perhaps no single film or work of fiction has done more to raise questions about the event than Oliver Stone's 1991 JFK with its exploration of events through the perspective of Jim Garrison, the New Orleans District Attorney who brought to trial of the one alleged conspirators.<br/><br/>Stone, along with his co-screenwriter Zachary Sklar, craft a peculiar film around the biggest unsolved mystery in American history. Indeed, JFK as a film owes much both to political thriller films such as Z (which also focuses on the assassination of a government official with multiple versions of the same events seen from the perspective of witnesses brought forth by a determined investigator) and the murder mystery genre. The only difference is that this is a murder with far more scope, far more suspects, and far more consequences than your garden variety murder mystery. It's a tale that takes in a large portion of still recent history and an era in time before distrust in government would reach its zenith (and perhaps has never truly subsided) and when terrible things very likely lurked in the shadows. <br/><br/>Incidentally, anyone convinced that Stone's vision is overly paranoid should seek out the published script book for the film with dozens (if not hundreds) of annotations. The film's vision, while leaning perhaps a bit far in cases, turns out to be far plausible a vision than it's often given credit for. The result is at nightmarish with its implications, so perhaps it's no surprise that the film led to an act of Congress to release more of the classified files related to the assassination which is still being released even as I type these words.<br/><br/>To bring the story to life, Stone assembled a first-rate team both in front of and behind the camera. Borrowing another trope from some of the better-filmed murder mysteries, the film has an all-star cast of actors in roles both big and small. Leading it is Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison, the New Orleans District Attorney who becomes both investigator and the audience's guide into the twisty world surrounding the assassination. Costner, though quite different from the real Garrison who was taller and more built, was nevertheless a perfect piece of casting as the intelligent everyman armed with a large amount of dignity and a determination to get to the truth no matter where it leads. Costner's performance plays up all of these elements and even the dark side of Garrison's obsession while also creating someone the audience is willing to follow for the three-plus hours the film runs for. <br/><br/>The rest of the film's cast is equally as strong. The Garrison investigation turns up a number of fascinating characters, any of whom could very well the protagonist of their own film, ranging from Tommy Lee Jones' quietly menace as Clay Shaw, Joe Pesci's eccentric David Ferrie, John Candy as the ever-shifting lawyer Dean Andrews, and Kevin Bacon as Willie O'Keefe (a composite character, one of several the film uses) among many others. There is also Gary Oldman's Lee Harvey Oswald is not only uncanny in his resemblance but a fascinating portrait in its own right, presenting many different versions of one of modern history's most enigmatic figures. The film also has its fair share of strong female performances from Laurie Metcalf as an assistant DA to Sissy Spacek as Garrison's wife torn between supporting her husband and being drawn into the world he's uncovering. That's without mentioning the effective cameo appearances from the likes of Edward Asner, Jack Lemmon, and Walter Matthau or the scene-stealing monologue delivered by Donald Sutherland as the mysterious insider known as X. Few films can claim to have perfect casts but, for my money, JFK is one of them. <br/><br/>Those behind the camera are the other half of the equation. Stone's team includes superb costume and set designs from Marlene Stewart and Victor Kempster which gives the film its sense of time and place. Yet as cerebral as the film is, a thinking person's thriller in many ways, it's also an immensely visual work with Stone often relying on the editing of Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia as well as the stunning cinematography of Robert Richardson. The three of them together weave in footage both archive and newly shot together into a tapestry that captures the viewer's eye as well as their brain. Underpinning it all is John Williams' score, perhaps one of his most underrated, that plays up not only the sense of unease but also the sense of what was lost all in the space of the film's opening titles and haunting themes elsewhere in the film. It's a remarkable tapestry all around.<br/><br/>Indeed, that is a nice summary of the film as a whole. Stone's JFK is, in essence, a murder mystery. One whose stakes have a firm basis in reality and based on a crime whose particulars are still hotly debated decades after the fact. With his cast and crew, he created a fascinating piece of film-making that crosses genres and time, presenting an incredible and paranoid vision of an earth-shattering event. Except that, if what's in the film is even half true, has deeply disturbing implications. That thought and the fact that the film led to documents being released speaks to the power of film-making and JFK as a film in particular."
"dataconflossmoor-1","10","15","33","20 March 2011"," The Fifties Are Over!
","This is an Oliver Stone film which delves into the tumultuous intricacies of the entire JFK assassination issue! Kennedy was a controversial president from the offset, primarily for the reason that he was stigmatized by many Americans because of his religion. Besides the problem which many voters perceived about Kennedy's Catholicism, a great deal of Americans were skeptical regarding Kennedy's election campaign tactics. Many citizens felt as though he orchestrated some scandalous chicanery in Chicago in the process of winning the 1960 election. All throughout his presidency, Kennedy was subjected to a ubiquitous and disdainful criticism from all sides of the political arena! Kennedy's nefarious presidency included alleged sexual indiscretions with many women, including prominent stars such as: Marilyn Monroe and Gene Tierney! The most intriguing angle which director, Oliver Stone, focused on, was the aspect of the depraved culture dissemination which prevailed in the United States during the Kennedy administration's reign. Kennedy's assassination led people to believe that our government was motivated by hate and fear, and not egalitarian democracy. Kevin Costner played a district attorney from New Orleans, Jim Garrison, someone who became ideologically wounded when he heard about Kennedy's assassination! His wife (Sissy Spacek) perpetually misunderstood Garrison (Kevin Costner) concerning his vehement pursuit to unravel a conspiracy theory relating to the whole gruesome Kennedy assassination incident! Conjecture which arose from the Warren Report, particularly with regards to the ""Magic Bullet Theory"", became a cumbersome and ambiguous documented fiasco which invoked a hasty dismissal to this entire affair. Dallas was fast and furiously becoming a city which embraced a bevy of secret service men who were in quest of evidence which pointed to potential political espionage that could be linked to the assassination of John F. Kennedy! The invidious aura to Dallas, back in 1963, made the city precariously conducive to being a venue that would get involved in a malignant nationwide political scandal! What the film ""JFK"" ultimately purported was not just that the assassination of a United States' President was a conspiracy, rather, this film wished to reiterate how deep rooted this covertly heinous conspiracy actually was! The CIA was now a corrupt arm of the law that became responsible for an egregious subornation by appointed officials to catalyst a nationally unprecedented form of deceit and collusion! The diatribes which Jim Garrison elaborated on, established a callous dichotomy between political temerity with the CIA, and an ideologically emblematic badge of justice with the American people. The scapegoat who expedited the JFK assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, was believed to be a spawn of Fidel Castro's Communist insurgency. When Jack Ruby murdered Lee Harvey Oswald, this merely fortified the concept that a politically volatile conspiracy was the culprit to this infamous string of murders. Rumination of this entire matter, allowed director, Oliver Stone, to engage in an acute portrayal of the disconcerting vindictiveness which was prevalent in America's boll weevil culture. All three movies; ""Natural Born Killers"" ""Talk Radio"" as well as ""JFK"" were Oliver Stone films which depicted the numerous demented mannerisms that are indicative of many reprobates in the Dixie region of this country. This is not to say that the South is any worse than any other area of the United States. It is simply to point out that they possess a certain style of belligerence which correlates to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. ""JFK"" did not win for best picture in 1991. The year, 1991, was a year in which ""Silence of the Lambs"" swept everything at the Academy Awards Oscars Ceremony! ""JFK"" was an intellectual film which possessed an alert articulation with the American people that their nation witnessed a pejorative, yet mandatory, transformation in their social pattern of behavior when John F. Kennedy was shot! This necessitated a revolutionary counter culture mindset that erupted virtually overnight! In 1963, much of the United States bore a solid resemblance to the 1950's. JFK's assassination evoked a concise revelation to the emerging and indelible culture of the 1960's almost instantaneously, and, with a very intrepid disposition as well. The whole Kennedy assassination affair brought on a neon accented metamorphosis to the American people that U.S. public officials were indeed, extremely sordid, and, that they were anything, but, squeaky clean paragons of virtue! The acting ability in this film is amazing! The list goes on: Kevin Costner, Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Tommie Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Walter Mathau, Ed Asner, and so many others! ""JFK"" is a lengthy film because it is filled with poignantly detailed dialog, not because it is hindered with a tedium of verbosity! This movie is one of Oliver Stone's greatest, and the wry authenticity to this film makes it one of the finest in the history of the silver screen! Without question, it is a 1990's classic! THUMBS UP!! PERFECT TEN!!"

"wrcong","5","17","39","22 November 2004"," A bad high school term paper
","The problem with this film is that while Oliver Stone continually ducks behind the curtain defending himself that he was only making a work of fiction, he uses enough historical imagery and data that the end product is as I have described it in the ""one line description:"" a bad history term paper. <br/><br/>I'll not recount the historical inaccuracies that permeate the film concerning the individuals involved save to note that attempting to make a hero of Jim Garrison would be laughable if the reputations otherwise damaged in the film did not belong to real people. I would encourage anyone who believes that the character Kevin Costner portrayed bore any philosophical or intellectual similarity to Jim Garrison should read a biography of Garrison some time. he knew he had no case, he knew his ""star witness"" was perjuring himself. but the call to glory was too great for Garrison to let those ""little inconveniences"" get in his way. <br/><br/>The real life Jim Garrison ultimately lost his case against Clay Shaw and Stone loses his case as well by attempting to glue together a variety of conspiracy theories, many of which had been debunked long before the release of the film in 1991. The problem, however, is that those theories are presented in ""JFK"" as historical verities, and large numbers of viewers haven't the historical grounding in the facts of the assassination and the scores of investigations conducted since to know where Stone is taking ""artistic license"" and the actual facts of the case. The result is that actual people end up being smeared by innuendo and ""factual evidence"" long since discredited."

","I am not American. I don't care about history. I hate politics. In other words, I am a very easy target for a movie such as this. This movie stirred up a lot of controversy for inaccuracies and what not, but I don't know much about the case and I don't care about digging deep. What Oliver Stone brings to the screen is an astonishing and exhilarating plot about the mystery and conspiracy behind Kennedy's death, as well everything that could make a film as fantastic as could possibly be.<br/><br/>The assassination of president John F. Kennedy in 1963 remains one of the most infamous and debating mysteries in American history. JFK is based on two books that dig deep into the case and uncover varies wild schemes about the assassins that connect to the FBI, CIA, mafia and others. I have never seen the theatrical cut, only the 205 minute director's cut. Absolutely not one single solitary minute was wasted. By no means was the movie stretched. It is rare that a movie as long as this can keep your eyes glued to the screen for that long. No other epic movie I've ever seen has gone by faster than JFK. Protagonist Kevin Costner investigates everything about the assassination for the whole movie where truths, secrets, and lies constantly unfold and twist throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner plays real life district attorney, Jim Garrison who is shocked just as everyone else to hear about the president's assassination. He has his suspicions, but trusts everybody that handled Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) as the patsy. Three years later, Senator Long (Walter Mathau) reawakens Garrison's interest in the case and Garrison's eyes open and he does all he can to seek the truth. Over the next few years, Garrison buries himself in the case where he makes many enemies and isolates himself from his wife (Sissy Spacek) and children. Absolutely nothing stands in the way between Jim Garrison and the truth.<br/><br/>Costner gives the performance of his career as a paranoid lawyer who is obsessed with something he will never achieve. A really cool aspect of this is the star-studded cast that follow Costner in supporting roles. Sissy Spacek, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, John Candy, Sally Kirkland, Walter Mathau, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Wayne Night, Michael Rooker, Frank Whaley, Laurie Metcalfe, Vincent, D'Onofrio, Brian Doyle-Murray, Donlad Sutherland, Bob Gunton, and Jay O. Sanders are all the familiar faces I saw. With a cast of this talent, even the littlest scenes are awesome as heck.<br/><br/>I officially believe what this movie says about the Kennedy murder. The killers must've had ties with the government. The records will no be available for circulation until another decade from now. If it wasn't an inside job, how come they have tried so hard for so many decades to keep in under wraps? Then there's the ""magic bullet"" theory: one bullet could have hit 6 (I think that's the amount) different places at different angles that went through parts of the body. The way Kevin Costner describes this theory is just genius. And Lee Harvey Oswlad was not the only killer. There's no way he could have used a rifle and fire six rounds in three seconds. Cosnter goes frame-by-frame and shows which angles the bullets come from. Eye-witnesses even say they heard gunshots from different areas. Then there's Oswald's murder either hours or a day after the Kennedy murder. There's so many pieces of evidence that prove Oswald was not the only killer. And I was sold on the president's death being an inside job.<br/><br/>The way Oliver Stone makes this movie is incredible. In some of his movies, it is evident that he is interested in style for style's sake. But the way Stone edits the movie and does all the cool camera tricks is merely a reflection on the story and characters.<br/><br/>This is purely a phenomenal movie.<br/><br/>4/4"
"hall895","8","9","18","6 February 2015"," One true fact: this is a great movie
","How much of what Oliver Stone presents in JFK is actually true? Certainly not all of it. Certainly not none of it. There's definitely some truth in there but Stone obviously takes some liberties as well. It's quite a challenge to make a film that purports to be a true story when nobody actually knows the true story. You end up interpreting history rather than documenting it. Stone obviously believes there was a conspiracy in the JFK assassination so of course that is the story his film will tell. The conspiracy is presented as fact. And Stone certainly makes a compelling case. He hasn't solved the JFK case. But after watching his film you may well think he came much closer to doing so than our government ever has. Stone made a great film. And perhaps more importantly he made a convincing film. You're buying what he's selling.<br/><br/>Stone uses New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison to make his case. Garrison was in fact the only man to ever bring anyone to trial in connection with the JFK assassination. It is Garrison's dogged investigation which drives Stone's film. There are so many obstacles in Garrison's way but he is determined to get to the truth. But in this case truth is almost impossible to find. Tales of shadowy conspiracy emerge but no matter how much Garrison digs it becomes evident he's never going to get to the bottom of this. He makes the best possible case he can given the circumstances. But the real truth, the scary truth, always remains elusive. Kevin Costner turns in an excellent performance as Garrison. He makes you believe in Garrison, makes you believe that this man is doing the right thing. Costner is the strong center around which the film builds. Everything swirls around him. And in this film there is always something, often many things, swirling. There's an awful lot going on. Stone's film careens past three hours and you get the sense it probably could have gone on for three hours more.<br/><br/>The film does go on for quite a long time and it throws so much information at you. There is a lot for the audience to process here. But the film never really gets bogged down. It is entertaining, compelling and thought-provoking throughout. Costner is the standout performer but the rest of the cast is stellar as well. Gary Oldman makes for an eerily convincing Lee Harvey Oswald. Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci bring unique personalities to the roles of two possible conspirators. Jones is calm and suave as Clay Shaw, Pesci nervous and manic as David Ferrie. Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek and a host of others play their parts well. Familiar faces pop up in even bit parts, the likes of Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and John Candy helping to move the story along. No part, no performance, is wasted. Stone weaves his web expertly. It is a very tangled story, there is the sense that in the end maybe all the strands of the story didn't quite come together. But how could they? This film is a ""true story"" in which nobody actually knows the truth. Ultimately Garrison, through a powerful performance from Costner, lays out his version of the truth. Through this character Stone tries to convince us. How much of what Stone presents you choose to accept as truth is up to you. You can question Stone's version of history. But there is no question that in JFK he made an excellent film. It may not be a perfect history. But it's a near-perfect film."
"GeorgeBailey","4","27","68","5 December 2004"," A Dishonest Movie
","In the end, this is a fundamentally dishonest film. Oliver Stone makes up facts, twists testimony, and fabricates much of the ""evidence"" in this film. Some have argued that this is okay because Stone is after a ""larger truth"" or because he is only creating a work of fiction and we should grant him some artistic license. Artistic license is fine up to a point, but artistic license is not without its limits. This is a film about truth. In the closing quote over the end credits, Stone tells us how we need to seek after the truth. Yet, Stone who meticulously researched so many aspects of this story, must have known that the ""facts"" he was presented were false and deliberately false.<br/><br/>A talented director can make a great propaganda film, but in the end it is still propaganda. For Stone then to get on his soapbox and imply that he is the one seeking after the truth while he drags the truth through the gutter only cheapens this film. Like sausages you may enjoy this film as long as you don't look too closely into how it was made.<br/><br/>4/10"

","I am compelled to comment on the film JFK after seeing it for the first time this week on DVD at my home. i have resisted the urge to view this film until now because having studied the JFK events and all the theories and stories surrounding the assassination, i came to the conclusion that Jim Garrison was very single minded and conspiracy crazy in his investigation of the fatal event that day in Dallas.<br/><br/>As an Englishman and a believer of scientific and methodical reasoning and deduction through facts and not fairy tales, I looked at this event in an unbiased way and decided to read all i could find and form my own opinion based on facts available. I have followed the investigations of Mr Howard Donahue, a very respectable and totally sincere man of outstanding abilities, and his credentials as an expert in ballistics and weapons etc are in my opinion, second to none, and after reading the book by Bonnar Menninger ""Mortal Error"", it is quite obvious that his conclusions are fact not fiction as in this film.There are very many things stated in the film that are factually incorrect, especially the point that garrison makes about the possibility of Oswald not able to get off the shots in time, which Mr Donahue proved is possible and actually beats that time! yet in the film it states that no one was able to do this! it seems that the film JFK is in itself a cover-up! and make Garrison out to be a hero when in effect he was only partially right and could not explain the bullets path with acurracy even though Mr Donahue showed how the ""magic bullet"" did in fact do the damage to JFK and Gov Conelly."

","Reviewed April 2012<br/><br/>The movie might have exaggerated, dramatized or manipulated certain real events, but what a stunning presentation featuring one of the best ensemble performances and intense screenplay that holds the audience attention for well over 3 hours. Though it reminds a bit of 'All the presidents men', it doesn't have its subtlety. <br/><br/>It all starts after the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the conspiracies surrounding the investigation. Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) a DA of New Orleans is convinced that there is a lot more to what the officials are willing to share and after finding a lot of loop holes in the Warren Commissions report, starts an unauthorized investigation with a small team from his office. He starts putting together facts, speculates certain conspiracy theories and the case starts consuming him. The fear, humiliation, object of losing his family doesn't stop him from going further. <br/><br/>The amount of information, fact or fiction fed to the audience in extraordinary and since it is a little speculative and involves one of the most popular conspiracy theories, there is a better chance the audience gets sucked into it. Screenplay doesn't allow a single dull moment and every actor gives a one up performance scene after scene. The look of the period and a clever mix of real and shot footage helps too. One problem here is that, it does not just present the important facts and let the viewer decide, it thinks for the viewer too. Thus dumbing down and ending up one dimensional. <br/><br/>Knowing the runtime beforehand might be a daunting task for you to attempt to watch this, trust me time flies is an idiom never more appropriate while watching this movie."

","A mediocre movie at best, made worse by Stone's terrible direction.  I have two major problems with this film:<br/><br/>1.  JFK is a vehicle of pure propaganda, promoting Jim Garrison's flawed and poorly developed theories of a conspiracy to kill the president.  Stone would have better served the viewing public by taking the time to develop his own theories rather than depending on the reactionary witch-hunt that Garrison perpetrated.  In the world of Garrison there is a rifle-wielding assassin over every grassy knoll.  I'm not suggesting that there is no evidence of a conspiracy to kill the president; I'm saying that Garrison's research into JFK's assassination was sloppy, lazy, and relied too much on conjecture... just like the investigation of the Warren Commission.<br/><br/>2.  Stone's direction on the cinematography is horrendous.  It's the equivalent of giving a 3 year old a camera and letting him film the movie. Stone's style is more subdued in this movie than in U-Turn or Natural Born Killers, but it's still annoying as hell.  I would blame cinematographer Robert Richardson, but he has shown the ability to do reasonable cinematography in ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" and ""Wag the Dog"".  Stone is the one responsible for the epileptic camera style.<br/><br/>All in all, JFK is a substandard ""historical"" movie.  Stone sank even lower on Nixon four years later.  3/10."

","""What is Past is Prologue""√Ç‚Ä¶ I just got over another viewing of Oliver Stone's JFK, this time the Directors cut, which runs for around 3 hrs 20 mins. As always, I was not bored for a single second of this high octane, virtually paranoia driven dialog. And I got reminded again why it is one of my favorite movies. I've always been a fan of the political thrillers with espionage thrown in, and JFK is undoubtedly one of the best (if not the best) of these. This is Oliver Stone at his best (which is telling, because there have been a lot of instances, especially in recent times, when it seems he has lost it). His Vietnam trilogy not withstanding.<br/><br/>Based on the true life memoirs of Jim Garrison, who was, as per the movie, the only person to bring a trial in the Kennedy assassination, this movie holds you from the first scene till the end. Unless of course, you're the kind who rates a movie's greatness based on the special effects. In which case, I would suggest you go for the Transformers sequel, as most of the world seems to be.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the New Orleans DA, who (after 3 years) discovers that things were just not right with the investigation and findings of the Warren commission regarding the murder of John F. Kennedy. Together with his office, a small yet dedicated bunch, he sets out to investigate. Against all odds and a labyrinth of characters, threats, murders and political intrigue, he manages to bring forth the case to trial. Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the final monologue by Costner has to be seen to be believed. And felt. No matter how many times I see this, it always brings a lump to my throat, as Costner elaborates on just why this is so important. Reminds you that Costner is capable of being there with the very best, despite some of the crap he dishes out at times.<br/><br/>As for the actual case, was there conspiracy involving the CIA, the govt, the FBI, and the anti-Cuban and anti-communist forces? Or is Oliver Stone just a paranoid genius, as many say? Well, I don't know, but the power of the movie can be gaged from the fact that it turned me, a completely disinterested person, into a believer."

","What a prime example of the paranoia of film director Oliver Stone.

Of course, when you are only presented one side of an argument, yours can sound pretty good, too. That's the problem with this film and the viewers who watched it, not stopping to think how biased it was in the first place. <br/><br/>One thing for sure, to be fair: it's an entertaining film. Kevin Costner, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Laura Metaclf, Sissy Spacek, Gary Oldman and others make up a pretty impressive cast. The cinematography is slick, too, all making the long film (189 minutes) pass fairly quickly.<br/><br/>Thus, it's good entertainment but don't be sucked into thinking is the truth.....as in any film. Remember ""Fargo"" where it says in the beginning of the film that it's a true story?

"Tulsa90","1","21","58","10 January 2005"," Entertaining But the Story/Script is Flawed
","JFK is entertaining and Costner and others do a fine job of acting. Oliver Stone did everything right here, except for the fact that the story and script are flawed. There have been countless conspiracy theories developed and presented about JFK's assassination over the last 40 years. A lot of these theories are interesting, but are not supported by facts or evidence. For instance, the theory that Lyndon Johnson invited Kennedy to Dallas so that he could have him killed and control the investigation and then assume power. This is an interesting idea, and seemed to gain some momentum due to the botched and covert autopsy of JFK. However, this theory is ludicrous. The theories put forth in this movie are not accurate or supportable by the facts either. The bottom line is that all of the evidence points to a lone gunman, and that lone gunman was Lee Harvey Oswald. His fingerprints were on the rifle found in the School Book Depository. The slugs removed from Kennedy and Connelly ballistically match the rifle found in the School Book Depository. The magic bullet theory is bogus. It has been proved that a single shot could have entered JFK through the base of his neck, exited, and then gone into Connelly's leg. This bullet did not have to take any magic turns or twists to do so, as the story in this movie suggests. Also, it has been proved that a high powered rifle bullet that enters a human head will cause the head/body to recoil towards the direction that the bullet came from. This was always my biggest hangup with the assassination. It appeared to me that the fatal head shot must have come from the front of JFK, as he recoiled backwards. This seemed to support the 2nd gunman on the grassy noll or in the storm sewer or wherever. Anyway, that is my 2 cents on the matter. This movie contains some good acting and scenery, but the story is just not accurate at all."
"classicsoncall","10","4","7","26 April 2018"," ""I like a man who's not afraid of bad odds.""
","I've avoided watching this film intentionally ever since it came out because I didn't want to be inundated with another whole set of conspiracy theories involving the assassination of John F. Kennedy. I've generally accepted the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, but if the story here of District Attorney Jim Garrison's obsession with the facts is even remotely accurate, then there's probably some room for doubt. I'm not saying I'm convinced, but what I am saying is that director Oliver Stone pieced together an intriguing and compelling film here, even if one were to hold fast to any prior opinions. What struck me as interesting was when Garrison (Kevin Costner) stated to his legal team that even if his prosecution of Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) failed, his long term goal was to give the American people ample opportunity to weigh all the conflicting evidence and eventually force the government to reveal the classified information on the assassination. Of course, with the film made in 1991, it's already coming upon the twenty five to thirty year time span referenced by Garrison and we're no closer to finding the truth. I kind of doubt that we ever will know what really happened on that tragic day in Dallas.<br/><br/>For true devotees studying the Kennedy assassination, an excellent companion piece for this movie would be the 1998 documentary, ""Image of an Assassination: A New Look at the Zapruder Film"". It won't put to rest any of the vast conspiracy theories, nor does it try to. What it does is present an intriguing story of how the Zapruder film came about, and how it captured a defining moment in the history of America, tragic as it was. Not for the queasy or ill at ease, it's a serious piece of film making that will affect you almost as much as the actual event did for those who were alive during the era to witness the tragedy as it unfolded on television."

Maybe not in the technical sense because Oliver Stone does know how make a film; however, he's just so wrapped up in his government conspiracy psychosis, that you would be better off spending your time with a film that doesn't pretend not to be a fantasy fairy tale. I love a good conspiracy flick when it has a shred of imagination and intelligence. But Stone has so many people involved the JFK assassination that the only person I'm sure wasn't involved in this massive conspiracy/coverup was me. How could so many people be involved in JFK's murder, but absolutely no one ever came forward to cash in on the hysteria in some way or another? Like I said, preposterous. I watched this movie hoping to see something that I hadn't thought of before. Instead I got a story in which Stone apparently went to a 3rd grade class and told them to make up as many wild hypotheses as they could about the 36th president's death. The only saving grace was Walter Matthau and John Candy who are always terrific when presented with dramatic roles. I think that this movie has ruined Stone's and Kevin Costner's careers. Neither one has made a successful movie since."

The Quaker woman called and set up an appointment for Oswald to be interviewed for the job. The superintendent hired Oswald at minimum wage (Oswald lied during the interview and said he was honorably discharged from the USMC). Now let's see, does this mean all of the above people were part of Stone's conspiracy?<br/><br/>What was in the package Oswald carried into the Depository on the morning of the assassination?

This is why  some wartime flicks seem agonizingly corny.<br/><br/>What separates ""JFK"" from most of its fellow propaganda films is the views and interests which it wishes to advance.<br/><br/>Namely, ""JFK"" advances the idea that Lyndon Johnson aided by the  Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Dallas Police Department, the Pentagon, Bethesda Naval Hospital, Parkland Hospital, the City of Dallas, the John Birch Society, communists, fascists, cuban left wingers, cuban right wingers,  mobsters of various political and personal bents, nightclub owners, topless dancers, reporters both national and local, and various others sought to snuff out President Kennedy and cover it up for infinity.<br/><br/>The vehicle for advancing this claptrap comes in the form of the intrepid and dogmatic District Attorney for New Orleans, Mr. Jim Garrison played by Kevin Costner.  Costner's portrayal of Mr. Garrison may be right on the money.  He spends most of the film completely absorbed with the idea of a conspiracy.  In addition, he makes very lengthy pronouncements throughout the film consisting mostly of bombast and grandiose theories from the fringe.  Mr. Garrison's staff are played up as ""yes men"" dupes (until the end, when we see some rebellion).  I thought it quite amusing that one of the deputy D.A.'s is played by the comedian, Wayne Knight, better known as Newman on Seinfeld.  Now  that is apropos.<br/><br/>Normally, this film should be considered simply trash.  However,  ""JFK"" has become some sort of an educational tool.  It shows up  in high schools around the country every year to ""teach"" our kids.  Of course it also shows up in our living rooms so the intellectually lazy can take a three hour course on President Kennedy's assassination.  Despite the outrage of traditional historians (whom I suppose are part of the plot themselves), the majority of viewers still buy the preposterous premise, hook, line, and sinker.

He can call it a fictional movie if he likes, however he uses historical characters and an historic event and attempts to portray them as truth. Nowhere does he say, ""I made most of this movie up."" He states that he takes some artistic license with the facts, however that is simply not allowed in this type of movie.<br/><br/>This movie is based loosely on a book by Jim Garrison. That could be another reason to play with the facts, however Stone is required as a historian to verify facts. He doesn't.<br/><br/>Stone obviously did a lot of research making this film. How, then, does he get the time to shoot wrong? The span of time between shots can easily be ascertained by the Zapruder film, yet Stone gets this wrong. Why? It doesn't fit with his theory. Stone then conveniently ignores the seating arrangements in the president's limo. Connolly was sitting inboard and lower than Kennedy, and therefore the bullet didn't go ""back and to the left."" It went in a straight line until hitting Connolly's rib, which deflected it.<br/><br/>There are far too many flaws to point out here. Why was Oswald handing out fliers in the area? He worked a block away. Who is Willie O'Keefe? Nobody. Yet he is presented as a historical figure. Oswald was picked up at the Texas Theater for killing police officer J.D. Tippit; not for killing Kennedy. Stone reports that this is not true, yet it has been proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Oswald killed him.<br/><br/>I could go on and on.

I mean, at the end of the movie, I couldn't even say who I thought I was SUPPOSED to believe actually killed JFK. Was it LBJ? The mafia? The Dallas police force?... Joe Pesci? Second of all, people who never believed that anyone besides Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK say that - after seeing this movie - they are now ardent believers that there actually was a conspiracy.

It's just that - once people started looking in that particular area - the Triangle began to seem like the disappearance capital of the world.<br/><br/>In the case of JFK, it seemed that Stone proved by example that - if you look hard enough - you can come up with evidence to support the theory that Santa Clause was behind JFK's assassination.<br/><br/>It seems to me that - after watching JFK, you either have to come to the conclusion that a) everyone in the known universe (except, of course, Lee Harvey Oswald) was in on the assassination, or b) that pretty much all of the conspiracy theories are the result of overactive imaginations.<br/><br/>The only points I give to JFK are for effort and for an impressive cast.<br/><br/>I give it 3 out of 10."

","No, not the film. What is astonishing is the number of people who have the garbled notion that this film somehow presented a ""true"" account of the Kennedy Assassination. Stone takes a little from many of the hodge-podge of conspiracy theories out there and smashes them together into a tedious glop of nothing that an unbelievable number of people who have reviewed this movie to date take to be accurate. Stone's work does a disservice to those people who have spent years earnestly trying to piece together the events of Dallas. Diligent investigators of alternatives to the explanation embodied in the Warren Report have long ago discarded much of the Garrison ""evidence."" Like Garrison, Stone casts a pall over all of the ""conspiracy theories"" with his plodding melange of discredited evidence and bogus witnesses. Like Garrison, Stone wants the glory of being THE GUY who solved the mystery. The problem is, his haphazard lashing together of the plausible alternative explanations of the killing with pieces of discredited nonsense only makes it easier for the Gerald Posner's of the world to discredit any and all alternative explanations. Stone (and Garrison) made links that careful alternative researchers have never made. In real life, Jim Garrison knew that his primary witness was perjuring himself regarding the ""sinister"" aspects of Clay Shaw's movements and alleged connections to Oswald, but Garrison went ahead with the evidence anyway. Stone only compounds the error. But from reading the reviews, it's obvious that as long as Stone plays into the mythology that JFK was a ""liberal hero"" who would never have made the errors LBJ did with regard to Viet Nam, Stone just has to be telling the truth -- regardless of what the historical records and JFK's own White House tapes reveal. It's equally obvious that for people who find ANY conspiracy theory easier to swallow than the ""lone nut"" theory, Stone is preaching to the choir. Trouble is, for serious researchers, he set the cause of alternative explanations of the assassination back to about 1968, because now those sincere researchers have to undo all the false connections to discredited theories that Stone made in this film. Posner and his ilk leaped at the chance to reconnect all the looniness of Garrison that careful alternative researchers had put to bed years ago. Even now, serious researchers still struggle with the misconceptions and misrepresentations that Garrison and Stone cobbled together in each man's quest for personal glory.<br/><br/>As a film, JFK does have a few worthwhile elements. Some of the performances are quite good, as to be expected from the stellar cast that Stone assembled. And on many levels, the film excited historical inquiry, which is an inquiry that is seldom a bad thing for any culture. It is ironic, though, that so many who would fault the Warren Commission (only a small fraction of whom have ever attempted to read even the summary sections for themselves) will grasp at straws every bit as ludicrous as the ""single bullet"" theory simply because those theories fit a preconceived notion that everything done in government is conspiratorial. Even so, portraying Garrison as some heroic crusader would be laughable if he hadn't spent so much of his life ruining the lives of people -- not just in the Clay Shaw matter, but throughout his career as a DA in New Orleans. Stone did not set out to make a documentary, of course, he set out to entertain and to provoke. Unfortunately, it becomes clear in reading the reviews here that there are many, many people incapable of making that distinction."

He also makes up things of his own and throws them in, and you don't know who made up what.  The problem, to me, is that this film is presented as a historical movie.  You expect some errors and dramatic license in those, and those do exist.  But Stone takes the time (3 hours) and style to make JFK seem like a carefully reconstructed docudrama, which it's not.  The ""100 Errors in JFK"" page aside, there are numerous errors in logic made by Stone, and the fictions stand next to the facts.<br/><br/>That's my big problem with the film: not that it pushes theories that are totally false, which it does, but that it relies on the ignorance of its audience to get by.  If conspiracy theories weren't so much more popular than the truth, I think a lot of  people would have been unable to stomach the way Stone attacks dead people who are innocent but unable to defend themselves, like Clay Shaw and David Ferrie.  I found myself disgusted by the way they were treated in the film.  They're not fictional characters, they were real people, and Stone is making a buck off the fact that millions of people have been fooled into thinking they murdered John F. Kennedy. Most of that fooling was done by Jim Garrison and his whacko crusade, and by guys like Fletcher Prouty, who were heavily involved with the film. Garrison isn't a hero, and he doesn't deserve the treatment he gets either. I wish I could evaluate the film more on its own merits- it's dramatic, if overlong.

Critics have noted that as a historian, Stone is a great filmmaker, and with JFK Stone creates a vision so extreme that even some conspiracy theorists have denounced it as completely impossible.

Much of its power rests on visuals. JFK is presented on different film stocks with various grains and color qualities, and these scenes--some of them lasting only seconds--are combined like pieces of an jigsaw puzzle to create a slowly emerging picture of American politics at its worst. The script, largely based on Garrison's book ON THE TRAIL OF THE Assassins, works in much the same fashion, shifting rapidly from scene to scene and back and forth in time. In combination, cinematography and script have a cumulative power that is most impressive, and Williams' haunting score adds greatly to the effect.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is easily one of the best I've ever seen. Kevin Costner is not, perhaps, ideally cast as Jim Garrison--but he plays in an extremely low-key manner completely devoid of any ""star"" trappings, and thus throws focus on the myriad of characters who swirl through the story. Gary Oldman is uncanny as Lee Harvey Oswald. His performance is such that you're often unsure if you watching Oldman or news footage of Oswald, and Brian Doyle-Murray achieves a similar effect with the smaller role of Jack Ruby.<br/><br/>But perhaps the most memorable are the host of actors who appear in unlikely roles and who acquit themselves exceptionally well. Joe Pesci gives a typically aggressive performance in the strange role of a right-wing paramilitary homosexual, Kevin Bacon is completely unexpected and flawless as a hard-bitten gay prostitute, and Tommy Lee Jones is impressive as the influential Clay Shaw. Other memorable performers include Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Sally Kirkland, and Donald Sutherland--and in a wicked twist of irony Jim Garrison himself appears as Justice Earl Warren.<br/><br/>The film is available on VHS and in several DVD packages, including a ""director's cut"" special edition that includes a number of extras, including an often interesting director's commentary, an interview with famous conspiracy theorist Prouty, and a documentary on certain intriguing records recently declassified by Congress as a direct result of this film's impact.<br/><br/>Historians and theorists will probably wrangle over the JFK assassination for decades, perhaps centuries to come. But whether you buy into Oliver Stone's scenario in whole, in part, or not at all, film is both extremely well-done and provocative to the max. If you want to stir conversation, this will do it.

","This Oliver Stone classic was a lengthy depiction of one of the most controversial presidents in U.S. history, John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was the consummate politician who garnered an unprecedented charisma with the American people by implementing lofty ideology with pragmatic political procedures!! His wife, Jacqeline, was a regal artifact of fashion and glamor, and this couple of President and First Lady which was labeled as ""Camelot"", easily elevated into the limelight of American culture! The Kennedys were American icons who invoked a dogged tenacity for social changes, and dirges of moral outrage, which titillated minorities and under privileged Americans!! On November 22nd, 1963, when John F. Kennedy was assassinated, it sparked a national uproar with the public perception of nationwide politics!!Such a pejorative pique mandated the launching of the investigative documents by the Warren Commission known as the Warren Report. Now enters Jim Garrison, (Played by Kevin Costner) who became engrossed in the factual details involving JFK's death. It was Garrison's ardent admiration of Kennedy that made his prescient curiosity an obsession. It was not just his responsibilities as a district attorney which nurtured his persistence, it was also for his own edification that Jim Garrison wanted to unearth facts about Kennedy's assassination. This entourage of interrogations was all in the hopes that his resolution to this issue would enhance his conception of the American system of democracy!! Garrison embarked on a series of inquiries concerning JFK's assassination which were of his own volition!! The Warren Report was an edict by the Johnson Administration as a way of putting a bureaucratic style explanation on the aggregate calamity concerning JFK's murder!! Such desultory data enticed the subornation of perjury by numerous public officials!! This virulent abuse of due process was tantamount to parading around a flagrant dismissal of democratic justice which was pertinent to the wishes of the American people altogether!! The initiative to challenge the findings of the Warren Commission was motivated by the fact that subsequent reports contained indiscretions to the Warren Commission's findings! Amidst the myriad of miscalculations in the Warren report was the principle bone of contention that more than one bullet was fired. The Communist insurgent who became the guinea pig for this debacle, Lee Harvey Oswald, ultimately became a target himself, and was assassinated by Jack Ruby! This string of heinous murders involving Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald, culminating with the ""magic bullet theory"" became a cogent revelation to the American people that the Kennedy assassination was indeed a conspiracy! In view of this whole incident, Dallas became the most politically scrutinized city in the entire world for over two years! The film, ""JFK"" brandishes all of these occurrences as stark revelations to the American public. Such an illustration was realistic because that is what these precarious occurrences were!! Many nuances to the assassination of John F. Kennedy became an outlet for depraved intrigue. The film ""JFK"" illustrates how the south took a lethal and flippant path of trepidation to Kennedy's killing!! The film ""JFK"" introduced the viewing audience to the debauched proclivities of many sordid reprobates in Dallas and New Orleans!! Such dubious walks of life demonstrated a social callousness which brought on an onslaught of purulent jeremiads as to why the prevailing political spectrum was so convoluted during this era!! The nefarious characters involved in the whole Kennedy conspiracy were societal outcasts. A copious quantity of them evoked such an ideological ambiguity to their feelings that even the cadence to their voices were extremely dehumanizing!! The film ""JFK"" is tremendously bolstered by incredible acting performances by an enormous number of accomplished actors and actresses. In addition to Kevin Costner and Sissy Spacek, other famous stars were: Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemon, Tommie Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Ed Asner, Walter Mathiau, and many others!! Oliver Stone does a tremendous job at directing this film, as he encompasses a disconcerting aspect of democracy into the entire genre of this movie! I enjoyed this flick more when I saw it a second time. This movie possesses a non-acknowledgeable realism that satiated my ghoulish perception of the whole Kennedy affair, and how it revolutionized American News coverage!! I have been to Dallas many times, and I can empathize with the attitudes that Oliver Stone was trying to expedite with this film. I was dining at Morton's Steakhouse in Dallas, which is right next to the book depository where Kennedy was shot. When I pointed out to a parking valet that this is where John F Kennedy was assassinated, he replied ""Who's John F Kennedy?"" Historical events reflect our lives accordingly! The film, ""JFK"" effectively portrays the assassination of John F. Kennedy as a tragic escapade which restructured America's political priorities!! I recommend seeing this film, it is up there with the better American films ever made!! One of the best films of the 1990's!!! Definitely!!"

NEVER MADE SUCH A SPEECH yet it's the climax of the film.<br/><br/>That is just one of the many glaring things in this film that are kluged. The HISTORY CHANNEL did a thorough job of debunking it.<br/><br/>In JFK, Oliver Stone takes history and fictionalizes it to make it a more dramatic, commercial piece that he passes off as re-enacting history. In fact, much of Stone's ""JFK"" movie is a lie, it never happened as Stone depicted it.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone has admitted using ""artistic license"" in creating the film but his depiction goes way beyond that. It's all so convincingly portrayed that many people have taken it as fact. It's not unlike the Jon Stewart Daily Show treatment of the news or Michael Moore's distortions in his ""documentaries"".<br/><br/>If Stone's upcoming movie ""W"" is anything like his previous work - it will be nothing more than a new collection of Stone's lies and distortions - simply not to be believed.

"DeuceWild_77","9","2","3","25 June 2019"," Intensely interesting thriller / drama, shot in documentary style, about the conspiracy behind J.F.K.'s assassination. The 1st and best from Stone's U.S. Presidents' trilogy !
","Absorbing thriller, written and directed by Oliver Stone, about the conspiracy behind the assassination of one of the most beloved American Presidents.
Based on the books by Jim Garrison (the real character played by Kevin Costner in the film) and Jim Marrs, ""JFK"" establishes the theory that Lee Harvey Oswald never acted alone.<br/><br/>The screenplay may be conjectural, and was accused of being one more ""conspiracy theory"" by the well-known controversial director from ""Salvador"" ('86) & ""Platoon"" ('86), but besides what it dares to be, thruth or not, it's an entertaining and engaging piece of great filmmaking, from the intense & frenetic editing by Joe Hutshing & Pietro Scalia (both fairly awarded with Academy awards) to the cinematography, shot almost documentary style, by Robert Richardson (also Oscar winner) and the precise direction of Stone with the 'maestro' John Williams once again providing an unforgettable original score.<br/><br/>The cast is fabulous and probably the best ensemble cast of 1991, led by a sober Kevin Costner, when he was at his peak in Hollywood (he started to shoot ""JFK"" after he won 2 Oscars for his pet project, the epic western, ""Dances with Wolves""), as Jim Garrison, the District Attorney of Orleans Parish, Louisiana who starts a new Kennedy assassination investigation after the 'holes' on the outcome of the Warren Commission, with Sissy Spacek playing his devoted wife, Liz and a bunch of great character actors playing Garrison's legal team: Laurie Metcalf, Jay O. Sanders, Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight & Gary Grubbs.
But it's in the supporting roles and the non-credited cameo and / or extended cameo appearances that ""JFK"" shines:<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones (the only member of the cast nominated for an Oscar) is splendid as the quirky Clay Shaw (alias, Clay Bertrand), Garrison's prime suspect, dominating every scene he's in, with Kevin Bacon & Joe Pesci, all playing against type as homossexuals, in a geniously & daring decision of casting.
Bacon is effective and convincing, Pesci goes a little over-the-top in some scenes, sometimes looks like he was still playing Leo Getz in ""Lethal Weapon II"", but still delivers without dragging the movie down.<br/><br/>Hollywood legendary actors and the all time screen partners, ""the odd couple"": Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, are great in their cameos, even if this time they don't share scenes.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman's metamorphosis into Lee Harvey Oswald is astonishingly 'chamaleonic' as the great method actor he is, and he deserved to be Oscar nominated as much as Tommy Lee Jones, but his performance is shorter on screen time and less 'showy', hence the snub...<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland as ""X"" could have made this kind of sinister part even in his sleep, and once again he does it very well showing what a pro he is.<br/><br/>The late great John Candy, in a rare appearance out of the comedy films, is fantastic as the dandy / flamboyant lawyer, Dean Andrews. His witty speech delivery is a riot to follow.
Bill Murray's older sibling, Brian Doyle-Murray plays Jack Ruby, the mafia man who shot Oswald.<br/><br/>Jim Garrison himself makes a cameo as Earl Warren, the head of the Warren Commission and Martin Sheen, who played Bobby Kennedy in the TV movie, ""The Missiles of October"" ('78) and JFK himself in the miniseries, ""Kennedy"" ('83), offers the intro narration of the facts that led to the Kennedy's assassination.<br/><br/>The ""Director's Cut"" is way better than the theatrical release, showing some pertinent extended scenes and added a bunch of new segments / characters that were left out in the cutting room floor like the Lolita Davidovich's interrogation sequence; Lee Harvey Oswald's impostor played by Stone's regular, Frank Whaley and John Larroquette, as a TV talkshow host, where Garrison was a guest.<br/><br/>Nominated for 8 Oscars, but winning just 2, ""JFK"" is one of the best movies of 1991 and if it wasn't for the sleeper hit, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and all the bandwagon around the Hannibal Lecter character, it could have won more relevant Oscars such as Best Pic and Best Director, at least...<br/><br/>I give it a solid 9 !!!"

","JFK is a film about the assassination of the late President John F. Kennedy on November 22,1963 and the events surrounding them in the eyes of Parish Orleans Attorney General,Jim Garrison. Kevin Costner starred in the film as Garrison together with Gary Oldman,Kevin Bacon,Tommy Lee Jones,Joe Pecsi,Ed Asner,Sissy Spacek, and Donald Sutherland. This is a 3-hour docudrama that tells the story of the investigation of Garrison leading to the trial of New Orleans businessman,Clay Shaw. Oliver Stone directs.<br/><br/>The movie was controversial in the sense that it provides the viewer interesting details such as conspiracy theories that led to the death of Kennedy.This includes government agencies such as the CIA,the FBI, and the US Government as well as the motivation behind the assassination such as the Military Industrial Complex which is behind the Cold War with the Soviet Union,the Vietnam War, and the other world events wherein the US military is participating.Added to that,it also has other groups involved such as the right-wing extremists,anti-Castro Cuban exiles, and many others.Added to that,it also provides other theories involve the participation of President Lyndon Baines Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, and the Mafia.<br/><br/>As a movie,it was a great one as it was interesting from beginning to end.Stone provided something that is hypnotic for the viewer.The pacing was great and it does not drag. But what about its accuracy and truthfulness? As it was known,the trial of Clay Shaw that occurred back in 1969 was considered a circus. Aside from that,the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations have firmly concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Many have bashed Oliver Stone for backing Garrison whom many considered a lunatic. But regardless if one's opinion to the conspiracy theories presented, this is one movie that would one surely enjoy."

","Despite JFK is considered a classic to this day and it has a very high score of 8,0 on IMDB I only saw this movie three months ago and I am glad I did it since I could see why it's highly praised to this day.<br/><br/>The movie is about Jim Garrison's (Kevin Costner) journey to find the truth about the Kennedy murder that happened on November 22, 1963. During the course of his investigations he comes across all the people that knew Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) before the murder. After a long series of meetings, personal crisis with his family (since his wife thinks that he is more concerned in the Kennedy murder case than his family) and a long trial he still thinks that he hasn't found the truth yet.<br/><br/>I'll discuss what I liked about this movie. The acting is exceptional by everyone involved: Kevin Costner gives one of his best performances of his career and in my opinion he should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor. All the supporting roles are played by famous faces of those years: Michael Rooker and Wayne Knight play Jim Garrison's colleagues, Kevin Bacon steals the scene as a male prostitute that gives Garrison some shocking revelations about one of Oswald's friends with which he plotted the murder while in Cuba: Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), a Louisiana businessman that was subsequently acquitted after the trial; also Joe Pesci and Donald Sutherland give great scene-stealing performances. And in supporting roles, despite they don't share scenes together, Jack Lemmon (as a journalist) and Walter Matthau (as a senator).<br/><br/>The direction by Oliver Stone is very good and the cinematography is very slick and stylish. The soundtrack is among the best musical scores from 1990s movies (second only to SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION) and it will remain stuck in your memory even hours after you watch the movie. The script is very clever. As I wrote in the summary it may be a very long movie at 3 hours and 17 minutes but I accepted it since it's a movie based on a true story and the long running time was useful for letting the viewers (especially the ones interested in this historical period) know all the details.<br/><br/>In substance, this is a true masterpiece thanks to great cinematography, great direction and great acting by everyone and I would probably consider it Oliver Stone's best movie (second only to BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY). Truly a masterpiece that deserves all the praise and positive reviews and worth recommended."

","The assassination of John F. Kennedy is one of the most tragic and defining moments in American and world history. Countless books have been written on the topic and the numerous theories on the truth behind the matter. ""JFK"" is the definitive take on the subject in film. Based on the memoirs of Jim Garrison, a Louisiana attorney who brought the case in court against Clay Shaw, a suspect in the murder of the president, the movie chronicles step by step Garrison building up his case as the revelation on the depth of the conspiracy eventually unfolds. Excellent casting and all the hallmarks that make an outstanding film are on display. Some of the most memorable scenes in film history compel the viewer here: Joe Pesci throwing a fit and confessing everything he knows as he sees the end draw near; Kevin Bacon as a homosexual convict who helps out with the investigation as he's ""got nothing to lose""; Gary Oldman's intermittent scenes as the tragic Lee Harvey Oswald; Donald Sutherland as the military insider who illuminates Garrison on what goes on in the higher ranks of power; and Kevin Costner's moving courtroom speech at the end.

Kennedy is arguably the most interesting one, stemming from the subsequent lack of a clear, satisfying & irrefutable explanation for how the machinations of assassinating the United States President was carried out, and what exactly was the motive behind it.<br/><br/>JFK is a 3-hour long political thriller that takes all the theories surrounding the case into consideration, looks for the inconsistencies in the Warren Commission, and then concocts a cleverly structured & masterly edited account that steadily grabs hold of the viewers' attention, only gets more gripping as plot progresses, and finally concludes by implanting a reasonable doubt in their minds."
"tedg","Null","11","32","9 October 2003"," Cinematic Realities, Lolita's Vision
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I have my own theory about film. There is always an explicit acknowledgment that what you are seeing is a film, distinct from reality. Many films incorporate that recognition into their being; the simple ones are just films about films and filmmaking, but there are other sophisticated ways of self-reference.<br/><br/>It is my belief that there is a constant `distance' in these matters. So for example when we have a fantasy film like `Spy Kids' that has a film world within it as part of the story, the distance between that inner film world and the film we watch (the distance between the world of Floop and that of the Kids) is the same as the distance between the world of the kids and that of the us, the viewers. I think this is a matter of hardwiring in the mind.<br/><br/>So it is no surprise to me to see how Stone has handled the three realities of this project. We have the reality of that day, burned into the memories of those of us that were around. We have a different `reality` that is abstracted from that by the hundreds of assassination investigators of all types. All of these, regardless of their credentials or position seem to have created not a reflection of reality but another reality altogether. Exactly where the line is between lies and wishful invention is lost forever for the thousands of people involved, from the hapless Arlen Spector to many of the witnesses.<br/><br/>(Arlen himself would make a career out of cinematically informed faleshoods, most famously in his role in the Clarance Thomas hearings.)<br/><br/>Stone has taken those two realities and added a third, an abstraction from both the reality and the hundreds of already abstracted pseudorealities. Stone's abstractions are completely cinematic: the nature of his Garrison has little to with the real guy and everything to do with Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch, down to the unctuous scene with his boy on the porch swing.<br/><br/>And it has everything to do with rigid conventions of the film detective story, where `clues' have to be dramatically and visually exaggerated and narrative flow simplified.<br/><br/>That's why Stone doesn't mind at all changing things radically from Marr, Garrison and Prouty: here, Ferrie actually confesses (never happened); Shaw really is a spook (we know now he wasn't); Bacon's character is gay and doesn't need hypnosis and drugs to `remember' a mention of the conspiracy. Stone doesn't mind, because his world is cinematic and that is the only way it makes sense in cinematic terms. That he really believes this himself (as opposed to the makers of `Forgotten Silver') is the really fascinating thing, but it makes sense because the world of film IS different.<br/><br/>And it does work as a film. Stone's recognition of shifts in levels of abstraction is reflected in the variety of camera types, film media, camera positions and motions, narrative perspectives, even battling editing rhythms. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking, very much along the lines of `Citizen Kane' which dealt with the same issues of reality, invention and mixed cinematic narrative.<br/><br/>Depending on what else I find from that year, I may put it on my list of the two `must see for cineliteracy' films of that year.<br/><br/>Even though Stone really believes this stuff and takes it dead seriously, his intuitions still rule. So he selects one of the fakest actors available to play his narrator. To emphasize the fakiness, he uses flat lenses in his glasses. This is one of the biggest no-no's in all filmdom. Every novice knows you do not do this.<br/><br/>Real glasses have curved surfaces in their lenses, fake ones are flat. Flat glasses have the disadvantage of reflecting the lights, crew and camera of the filmmaking process, something that Costner's face does hundreds of times. To a moviewatcher, this makes that character more like the figures in the courtroom model of the plaza than like us.<br/><br/>In fact, the only realistic acting in the whole project is by Lolita Davidovich. Her piece is great.<br/><br/>This film is bound to become famous again when Mel Gibson releases his similar fiction on Jesus, also leveraging conspiracy, also driven by the laws of cinematic narrative in the face of truth if need be.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","This is my fifth attempt at posting a comment on this film. The four preceding ones never made it and no reason was given by IMDb. I can only suppose they were considered libellous to Jim Garrison and Oliver Stone. All I really wanted to point out is that 'JFK' is loosely based on the opinions of Jim Garrison, which are already in great doubt. According to the facts reported in the book 'American Grotesque' by James Kirkwood who covered the Shaw trial, the very short version of this story is that Jim Garrison had a vendetta against Clay Shaw ever since Shaw (a real Southern gentleman) had once reproved Jim Garrison for slapping his wife in public in a New Orleans restaurant. Clay Shaw was the ultimate victim of Garrison's persecution, which was partly motivated by Mr. Shaw's presumed sexual orientation and Mr. Garrison's very real homophobia. Is this 'clean' and succinct enough for the censors? Thank you."
"jadedalex","2","8","22","28 March 2012"," Oliver 'Twists' JFK
","Oliver Stone is a very talented movie director and a tad paranoid. This movie is littered with misconceptions and for the lack of a better word, lies. Kevin Costner (one of the most boring actors in the world) does his usual cardboard impression (remember his take on the very flawed Eliot Ness in 'The Untouchables'?) of the 'valiant' Jim Garrison.<br/><br/>In truth, Garrison was a couple beers short of a six-pack. It is fairly amusing that the Hollywood left decries the John Wayne cowboy and Indian movies, and then proceeds to rewrite history with its stirring 'docudramas'. Never mind the facts, just shoot the movie. Hollywood's love letter to Erin Brockovich overstated her role in the PG and E mess. In 'JFK', Oliver Stone points his finger at just about everybody in regards to assassination of Kennedy. I went out of the theater feeling culpable myself!<br/><br/>Which is not to say that 'JFK' is not entertaining. The story is easily one of the greatest 'mysteries' of our time, and Stone's film engaged me despite all of its half-truths. The big problem is that a whole generation of moviegoers who saw this film no doubt accept Stone's version as some sort of historical document. This film should come with the horror show admonition: 'It's only a movie'.<br/><br/>Costner seems to have taken over Robert Redford's mantle: always play the hero. His 'Eliot Ness' in 'The Untouchables' is so noble and good it's enough to make one wretch. Again, never mind the facts, that the real Eliot Ness had his share of problems and peccadilloes. The movie is only interesting because of the Sean Connery character (no doubt made up of whole cloth).<br/><br/>Then again, I have had problem with 'docudramas' ever since the putrid 'The Greek Tycoon'. It's obvious what they are doing with these films, and it's obviously just 'entertainment' but unfortunately, these films leave lasting impressions in one's mind about real people and real history and the end result is the proliferation of lies.<br/><br/>Hollywood seems to be getting desperate. The recent news is that Jane Fonda will portray Nancy Reagan in an upcoming film. What Hollywood doesn't seem to understand is that not too many people are watching anymore. Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher? Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin? I'm not even angry anymore with the Hollywood left. I just ignore them.<br/><br/>'JFK' is a well-crafted movie, but I would not want to sit through it again. I'm one of those nuts that actually believes that the born loser Lee Harvey Oswald took aim at Kennedy from a bookstore depository window. And that he pretty much acted on his own.<br/><br/>Call me naive. The Kennedy assassination was the mother of all conspiracy theories, and she has begotten many moronic children since then. I don't buy into many of them."
"olye","4","9","26","22 June 2005"," Something for every conspiratorialist
","As much as I could gather, according to Oliver Stone in this movie, the assassination of JFK (as well as RFK and MLK) seems to have been carried out by a conspiratorial network consisting of people drawn from:<br/><br/>a) disgruntled right-wing extremists in this country; b) fanatical Cuban nationalist mercenaries; c) the FBI; d) the CIA; e) the Dallas police department; f) the more secret echelons of the conventional military; g) members of Kennedy's cabinet, including then Vice President Lyndon Johnson; h) organized crime; and i) Big Business.<br/><br/>The reasons for the assassination include (but aren't limited to):<br/><br/>a) punishment for Kennedy's backing out during the Bay of Pigs; b) Kennedy being soft overall on Communism, and c) being too tough on organized crime; d) his perceived desire to ratchet down the cold war, including e) his plan to end US involvement in Viet Nam, which would in turn f) deprive the military of a much desired war and concomitant inflated military budget, which would then in turn g) deprive Big Business of lucrative military contracts.<br/><br/>Lee Harvey Oswald is portrayed as a CIA operative who was only peripherally involved in the plot, but was then used by the masterminds as the ""patsy."" Oswald was particularly attractive for this role because, as part of earlier operations, he had developed a pro-Communist persona that had allowed him to infiltrate and spy on left-leaning groups. Among his assignments was even a fake defection to the Soviet Union. After the assassination, Oswald himself was assassinated before he could talk. Thus the murder of the president could be publicly attributed to the lone action of a pinko wing-nut, the dual results being the elimination of a pesky, non-ball-playing head of state and further fanning up of the flames of furor against the Evil Empire and its world-wide pawns.<br/><br/>Was there a conspiracy? We are left with no doubt that Oliver Stone thinks so. If there was a conspiracy, is this version correct? Again, we must conclude that Oliver Stone thinks it is. At one point in the movie, Kevin Costner even says (parapharsed) that ""What we do here now is only the beginning. It may be 25 or 30 years before someone finally finds the real truth."" I'm sure it's entirely coincidental that that time frame would take us right up to 1991, when this movie came out.<br/><br/>He's casting a pretty wide and implausible net here. It is implausible, if for no other reason, just because there's no way you could get all of these disparate people to work together, even if they were united in mutual hatred of Kenedey's guts. Petty personality differences and territorial squabbles would inequitably doom any such ambitious effort. Not just in the JKF assassination, but in general, humanity is saved from these kind of large scale conspiracies by its own inborn vainglorious proclivities."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to his second movie of 1991,JFK. <br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Jim Garrison, a New Orleans District Attorney, discovers there's more to the JFK assassination than the official story.<br/><br/>Does anyone still believe Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman?? Sorry too controversial?? I'll rephrase that...... Do you know anyone who believes Lee Harvey Oswald acted all by himself in killing Kennedy?? I certainly don't. <br/><br/>Now on to the movie Itself. <br/><br/>Watching this movie, It's impossible to believe the Warren report, because the physical evidence makes its key conclusion impossible: One man with one rifle could not have done it. If one man could not have, then there must have been at least two. Therefore, there was a conspiracy. But we just don't know who!! Maybe it was the CIA, maybe the FBI, it could have been Castro, or the anti-Castro Cubans, the Mafia or the Russians, or all of the above, were involved. We just don't know.<br/><br/>What we do know, we know by heart. The grassy knoll, three shots in 2.6 seconds, Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, the Zapruder film, Jack Ruby, the hobos in dress shoes, the parade route, the Bay of Pigs, the eyewitness testimony, the woman with the umbrella, the palm print, the wrong shadows on the photograph etc.<br/><br/>JFK is a masterpiece. It's huge cast is perfect. Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, John Candy, Walther Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spaseck. Special mention must go to Jay O.Sanders and Michael Rooker too, I always like seeing him and screen, and here is no exception. Of course Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for an Oscar for his work here. But truthfully most of the main and supporting cast could have been. None more so than KC, who gives a passionate performance. <br/><br/>The writing, the directing, the acting, the editing, the music (by John Williams) the photography, are all brilliant. It's one of those movies where EVERYTHING is on point. <br/><br/>I honestly expected the movie to sweep up at the Oscars, I was shocked Silence Of The Lambs won what it did, when it was up against this, and many others. I hadn't seen the movie when it won what it did, and was unimpressed when I did (but that's another story) JFK was nominated for 8 Oscars (winning 2) and I think it should have been more, with KC being robbed of a nomination himself. He was certainly more worthy of winning than Anthony Hopkins in his glorified cameo!! Hardly in the movie, but he won best actor. KC helms a 3 hour epic, and is ignored.<br/><br/>I suspect the movie was too controversial to win, as was KC's character, too controversial for a nomination!! Stone received a lot of criticism at the time for having Garrison as the ""hero"" of the movie. <br/><br/>If I was to make a boxset of KC movies, for future generations to get a grasp of KC as an actor, this movie would be in there, along with Dances With Wolves and Field Of Dreams. <br/><br/>Despite being viciously attacked in the media, before it was even released. JFK ended the year, the 17th highest grossing movie of 1991 with a $70 million domestic gross. More than Thelma & Louise, the popular comedy Hot Shots, and action flicks Point Break and Last Boy Scout. <br/><br/>Another classic, and 10/10 for this reviewer"
"possumopossum","Null","10","30","26 November 2006"," Pure Speculation
","A lot of garbage has been bantered about JFK's assassination, and this movie is more of the same. It's good for entertainment, but I wouldn't recommend taking the theories they are postulating seriously. The theories are interesting, but they have no evidence to support these theories whatsoever. It is pure speculation. We may never know the whole truth about what happened in Dallas, Texas on November 22nd, 1963. Personally, I think the Warren Commission is true for two reasons: (1) The government couldn't do something like an assassination that neatly and cleanly. They would find a way to screw it up, because you have too many people in the government with their own agendas going. (2) Jack Ruby in the Mafia? NOT BLOODY DAMN LIKELY. Ruby was a hothead. Hardly the type who would work for the Mafia. He was the type of person the Mafia would love to make an example of. Craves too much attention, talks too much.<br/><br/>My evaluation? Interesting. But no basis in fact. If this were presented in a courtroom, it would be tossed out for lack of evidence. No wonder Jim Garrison lost the case against Clay Bertrand. 5 out of 10."

","Good lord, the cast in this movie!<br/><br/>Daunting run-time notwithstanding, ""JFK"" is a work of consummate professionalism, from the camera work to the writing and direction. I'm not a history buff when it comes to the Kennedy assassination, so I couldn't tell you how accurate this is, but the important thing is that it *feels* accurate. It's a stroke of genius to make Kevin Costner's character the heart of this thing, and that draws you into a story that just keeps moving; and then it's just star-gazing, with one familiar face after another popping up. I don't know when I'll have the time set aside to watch this again, but I can tell you this: it doesn't feel long.<br/><br/>This is high-conspiracy at a dangerously entertaining level."

"mim-8","Null","9","29","27 June 2009"," This is how it happened
","JFK is the best political assassination conspiracy thriller ever made! It's a visually striking, documentary like movie with heart-throbbing pace, and bravura acting with story based on nothing but hard facts. It was striking that polls conducted from 1966 on show that as many as 80% of the American public hold beliefs contrary to the findings of the Warren commission. And how could anybody believe the report that invented a ""magic bullet"" theory which supposed to explain how a mixed up character like Lee Harvey Oswald, could have managed to shoot both the president and governor Connally six times, including a fatal frontal shot to John F. Kennedy's head, clearly visible in Zapruder film, firing only three times in 5.6 seconds from up behind the motorcade. The facts of the case show that there had to be another gunman, and if so than we have a conspiracy, and everything that happened later both to principal characters, witnesses and shift in foreign and domestic American politics, only give proof to that conclusion. <br/><br/>Oliver Stone waste no time in presenting the case. I've never seen a movie 197 minutes long, that doesn't let your mind wonder for a second. People who testify to various aspects of the assassination are moving in front of your eyes like passing trains and every one of them puts another piece in never completed puzzle of conspiracy behind the Kennedy assassination. This film, along with ""Executive action"", filmed only 10 years after, in 1973, show that the plot to kill John Kennedy is worked out and organized in a way that there's no doubt that it leads to the highest ranking government officials and all the industrial and banking tycoons that had everything to loose with JFK's policy of non involvement, racial equality and d√É¬©tente with the USSR. Later assassinations of Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy, show that this pattern was used in a same manner, to eliminate most dangerous political threats to the ""big money"" and conservative politics. Like Donald Sutherland's ""X"" has said in the movie ""Who benefited? Who has the power to cover it up?"", these are the questions Stone's film is trying and in my opinion succeeding in giving good answers to. More than recommended, a must see."
"mmallon4","10","4","10","12 April 2015"," No Stone Unturned
","I'm aware in modern times conspiracy theories have become detrimental in discovering the actual truth (largely thanks to the internet) but I can't deny that I just love this sort of stuff. JFK requires your utmost attention and at a runtime of three hours, it feels like the movie leaves no stone upturned (pardon the pun) in its examination and deconstruction of the Kennedy assassination. Admittedly the first time I watched JFK I didn't understand much of what is discussed in the film. It's a lot to digest in a single viewing but there are more intriguing theories here than an entire season of Ancient Aliens (minus the bad haircuts and awkward line delivery); but I can happily watch JFK multiple times to further understand it and eat up every single word of dialogue. I doubt we will ever need another film made about the Kennedy assassination; what highly talented filmmaker could be more passionate about the subject matter? I also highly recommend watching the director's cut for even more conspiracy goodness to evoke the paranoia in you.<br/><br/>JFK is one of those movies which makes you most appreciate the art of editing, incorporating many layers of time and reels of stock footage; no scene during the movie's three hours is edited in a standard fashion. The editing help make the film's exposition exciting; a character may be describing an event as the scene cuts to just that in an obscured or dreamlike manner. The Mr. X sequence with Donald Sutherland is a perfect example of how to pull of engrossing exposition; plus is there a more classic cold war, spy movie type scene than meeting a suited man in the park to receive classified information. Likewise, John Williams' theme for JFK evokes my inner patriotic American, even if I'm not American. The militaristic and at other times conspiratorial nature of the score helps make the movie as compelling as it is. The black & white scenes such as those featuring the military feel reminiscent of Seven Days In May with shades throughout of the John Frankenheimer style. I'm sure Stone must have also taken some pointers from the first movie about the Kennedy assassination, 1973's Executive Action.<br/><br/>JFK continues the tradition of films such as The Longest Day in which a large ensemble cast of familiar faces and great screen presences to help guide us through the story. It's amazing seeing different generations of actors doing some of the best work their careers and utilizing their screen personas to full effect even if many of them are only on screen for short spaces of time. Some of the figures in the story strike me as too bizarre to have been real-life people, especially David Ferrie and Claw Shaw.<br/><br/>I've always been in defense of Kevin Costner against criticisms of being a dull actor. Granted his career did go downhill in mid 90's and has never fully recovered but in his heyday of the late 1980's/early 90's he was such a hot streak of films. Casting him in the role of Jim Garrison couldn't be more perfect as Costner is much like a modern-day classic movie actor in the vein of everymen like James Stewart, Henry Fonda or Gary Cooper. He's been most commonly compared to Cooper (the courtroom section of the film is reminiscent of Cooper's role in The Fountainhead) although with his southern demeanor I would compare him to being a modern-day Henry Fonda. I would defy anyone to call Costner a bad actor after watching the film's courtroom scene. Talking almost non-stop for 40 minutes and never losing my attention while exuding a stern, emotional and towards the end of the speech, a fragile voice; with his final conclusion bringing a tear to my eye.<br/><br/>I find Jim Garrison's family life interesting itself, mostly from the relationship with his wife. What does he see in her? She does not support his endeavors, despite his noble cause and unlike her husband, she is susceptible to believing what the media tells her. Here is a man who spends the movie questioning and fighting the system yet has a wife with a conformist personality. I can't say for certain what they were like in real life but the in film I grew to dislike her character.<br/><br/>JFK draws no conclusions, it doesn't prove who assassinated Kennedy and allows the viewer to make up their own mind. Stone may be often criticized for his use of a dramatist's license but as I say with many films based on historical events; this can make for a more compelling story. Even if there are untruths present, the film can act as a gateway to wanting to discover the real story. The movie did leave me a feeling of (good) anger and is one of the films I can credit with helping to influence the way I think.<br/><br/>""Dedicated to the young in whose the spirit the search for truth marches on."""

","Seen the cast list for JFK ? Tommy Lee Jones , Gary Oldman , Sissy Spacek , Kevin Bacon , Jack Lemmon , Walter Matthau , Donald Sutherland and John Candy in one movie . Even if you're not keen on some of the aforementioned actors you'll be impressed by all of their performances and for this reason alone JFK is essential viewing . The only actor I wasn't impressed with was Kevin Costner but I don't recall ever being impressed by him in anything he's ever done . But don't let that put you off because the rest of the cast are superb <br/><br/>If that's not a strong enough recommendation let me point out the technical endeavor this movie required of mixing stock film footage and reconstructions which could have ended up making this movie a jarring unwatchable mess . Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia's editing is flawless while Robert Richardson's cinematography is outstanding and Oliver Stone maybe accused of over directing his later movies ( Notably NATURAL BORN KILLERS ) but here everything works perfectly from the director<br/><br/>Unfortunately Stone's script has to come in for the movie's most serious criticism - It's paranoid speculation , so much so that there's a danger JFK goes beyond fiction and becomes fantasy . <br/><br/>First off it insinuates Kennedy was killed because he wanted to pull out of Vietnam . Considering there's little evidence of this where does this source information come from ? It's a well known fact that Kennedy was a fan of special forces and increased the budget and manpower for the green berets . Does this strike you as a man who'd totally pull out of South East Asia ?<br/><br/>Secondly Vietnam would have meant very little from a pentagon chief to the American on the street in 1962/63 so we're to take it a country hardly anyone had heard of led to the murder of the President because he was going to pull US advisors out of Vietnam ? In that case I wonder why no one murdered Reagen because of he didn't send advisors to aid Christian phalangists in The Lebanon or why no one murdered Clinton because he didn't send advisors to aid the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan ?<br/><br/>Thirdly , there seems to be an agenda in the screenplay that Kennedy was murdered so that the Vietnam war would generate money for American companies. I can't disprove this conspiracy theory of course , but think about this - Why would America sacrifice 58,000 war dead , have another 250,000 Americans maimed for life and lose all moral prestige in order to build a few thousand helicopters ? They could have easily supplied billions of dollars worth of military equipment to South Vietnam ( America did do this under the Vietnamization program in the early 70s ) without getting caught up in the quagmire themselves <br/><br/>Oh and there's several other points the script kicks up that can't be proved or disproved like Lee Harvey Oswald being a double agent working for the CIA against world communism , a mysterious character only known as X who sees senior military chiefs planning to do away with Kennedy etc , things that only probably only exist in the imagination of Jim Garrison and Oliver Stone. Stone also wrote the Oscar winning screenplay of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS , read the source book by Billy Hayes and you'll realize that the screenplay to the book is a series of mass exaggerations and inventions on the part of Stone . He's done the same with JFK <br/><br/>I don't want to give the impression that I disliked the movie because I didn't . However much of the movie makes claims and insinuation that can't be backed up by facts and if you think there's nothing wrong making a conspiracy theory blockbuster involving human tragedy think about this : Someone makes a movie called 9/11 where Mossad agents are seen covertly entering the United States , everyone in the WTC called Rubinstien and Goldberg phone up sick on the day of the attacks and a fictional character in the film states that he's seen documents in the White House proving that the war on terrorism is a big conspiracy involving Israel's government and American oil companies who were both behind the attacks carried out on the 11th September 2001 . Does anyone else feel disgusted we might be seeing this production in the future ?"

","One of the largest ensemble casts ever with Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Laurie Metcaff, Sally Kirkland, Ed Asner, Walter Matthau, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Brain Doyle Murray, John Candy, Lolita Davidovich and dozens more star in the 3 hour epic on the Kennedy assassination from director Oliver Stone. Stone is a skillful director and this is a well made film with an excellent editing job from Joe Hutching and Pietro Scalia who had been veterans of other Oliver Stone films including Talk Radio, Born on the 4th of July and Wall Street as they edited down what must have been hours of film shot for this movie blended with actual archive news footage and the performances of the films many actors. Robert Richardson does a masterful job with the cinematography as well. This film is adapted by Stone and screenwriter Zachary Taylor from the books Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs and On the Trail of the Assassins by former New Orlenas D.A. Jim Garrison, calls for a large cast and gives them plenty to do. Garrison was a controversial figure in life and his book was largely hailed as ridiculous. Garrison's book proved he had no credibility as an expert on the Kennedy Assaination. He had a small role in the film as Chief Justice Eral Warren and has since passed away. Jim Marrs has decided to move on to the equally lucrative flying saucer market with his equally absurd book Alien Agenda. Stone likely has toyed with the idea of an Alien conspiracy movie but in the meantime he's working on a World Trade Center film. JFK deservedly won two Oscars for it's cinematography and editing and received another six Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Tommy Lee Jones, Best Sound, Best Music Score and Best Screenplay. It is a well written screenplay but it's too bad that for many film goers the film is viewed as historical fact rather than melodramatic, dramatized, politicized fiction blended with an actual historical event and a subsequent trial involving Garrison. For all the good work that went into this film it results in a wasted effort and opportunity. I would give this it's cinematic merits but for it's content and the direction it takes I can only give this a 6.5 out of 10."
"erwin-smolders","10","5","14","3 December 2013"," The plain, unvarnished truth
","I admire oliver stone for making this film. In a way, this movie's encountered as much opposition as the investigation led by Jim garrison. All the reviews I've read so far have one thing in common. The very first line reads something like: ""The history is dubious"", or,""It's pure conjecture"", before moving on to safer territory, such as the cinematography and editing. They all feel the need to state that they personally do not believe there was a conspiracy. A sympathy shared by the rest of the country apparently, since no new investigations have occurred since Jim garrison lost his case against clay shaw. From what I understand, president Kennedy was a good man, one of the few US-presidents who tried to do right by his people. And yet, decades after he was murdered under circumstances that a four-year-old would have found suspicious, they still favor ignorance over common sense. This man may have forfeited his life to help his fellow Americans, who apparently didn't care enough to dig deeper. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. A husband and father was murdered, and nothing has been done about it. It makes me sad."
"slokes","8","3","7","30 December 2016"," Paranoid Chic
","The fact I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone doesn't reduce my sincere admiration for this involving, brilliantly packaged indictment of the processes used to affirm his guilt. As a movie, ""JFK"" rises above any duty to history to develop what director- writer Oliver Stone calls a ""countermyth"" to what he calls the myth of the Warren Report.<br/><br/>In short, it became a template for inculcating what I would call ""paranoid chic,"" a desire to question comforting ideas that goes beyond all rational objections to fashion a mesmerizing if flawed piece of entertainment. ""JFK"" is, in more than one way, revolutionary.<br/><br/>New Orleans, November 22, 1963. While news of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy filters through barrooms and reaches the office of district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), an argument between right-wing hothead detective Guy Banister (Ed Asner) and his alcoholic gopher Jack Martin (Jack Lemmon) over strange goings-on in their office escalates into a violent assault. In time, this becomes the lynchpin of an investigation Garrison undertakes that becomes a re-investigation of the Kennedy murder, one that will lead to the only indictment of anyone accused of the president's killing.<br/><br/>Garrison spends much time trying to unravel the ""tangled web"" at the heart of the killing, with much attention paid to the unique character of New Orleans, a city where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald spent much of his life. With a flair for detail and a pregnant line, Stone puts us at Garrison's side as he closely questions a bizarre character named David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) who drove to Texas on that fatal day, he says for some ice skating and geese shooting. Big Jim shakes his head.<br/><br/>""I find your story simply not believable,"" he says.<br/><br/>""Really?"" Ferrie responds amiably. ""What part?""<br/><br/>It's a welcome moment of levity that demonstrates Stone's complete command of the material. For more than three hours, he brings up a slew of bigger-than-life witnesses who either convince us with their honesty or repel us with their sinister indifference to what happened. In time, Garrison is mocked on national television, betrayed like Jesus by one of his closest aides, and faces divorce before getting the chance to make the case he has built to a jury in a lengthy yet gripping courtroom sequence, one of the finest ever made.<br/><br/>The sequences work as vignettes, many of them worth watching over and over. Lolita Davidovich shines in a brief turn as Beverly Oliver, a self-described ""two-bit showgirl"" who once saw Oswald at a club with his future killer, Jack Ruby (Brian Doyle-Murray). Tommy Lee Jones oozes southern charm as the man Garrison eventually brings to trial, Claw Shaw.<br/><br/>Only a couple of sequences hint at a larger truth, that Stone is throwing up a lot of clay pigeons in his attempt to fashion his countermyth. One witness, Jean Hill, is ridiculously dragged screaming from the murder scene to be told by officials in a ludicrous scene that she didn't see or hear what she, and we, just did. There is also some misdirection thrown in the direction of three tramps picked up at the scene, which Stone in his 2001 director's commentary admits turned out not to be the assassins the movie paints them as being.<br/><br/>But in the main, the film holds together very well by keeping the focus on Garrison, who speaks forthrightly about what he believes. As in his performance in ""The Untouchables,"" Costner is a master of understatement who saves his passion for the final summation in court. It's hard to keep a dry eye watching him go.<br/><br/>After, you can shake your head all you want. I surely do. But ""JFK"" has left a mark on the American consciousness that feels well-earned when watching it. By enshrining skepticism as not only patriotic but a citizen's duty, the film successfully pushes a less comfortable view of what life is really all about that has become its most lasting legacy, and does so in a way that makes three and a half hours feel like a handful of minutes. Truly epic, however mistaken."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>Wheter or not do you believe the things shown in this movie are true (or at least mostly) - ""JFK"" (1991) is a one great movie. First time seen just now in 2016, it kinda blew my away because i didn't expected that director's cut which i've seen, that runs almost 3 h 20 min will be THIS entertaining, involving and provoking at the same time. <br/><br/>Cast is probably one of the very best (if not the best) i've ever seen, and while some of them played a bit over the top (J.Pesci), there isn't a weak performance here - that is because of a great director working in his best form. Now i do believe that this Oliver Stone's (who's movies are a bit uneven sometimes but ALWAYS interesting to watch) movie is probably his most ambitious ever, as much as i love ""Platoon"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and highly admire almost every other (well except for the poor ""Alexander""). <br/><br/>Script of ""JFK"" is brilliant. Many times watching this movie i asked my self a question - did this really happen or this is a pure fiction? I do not ask these questions in my life often (almost never), as i do not believe in big conspiracies overall (fake moon landing and fantasies of haters in that spirit), but this movie is so superbly written that during the movie and closer by the end i started to have my doubts. I do not honestly know many facts about the killing himself, just as much as probably everyone else, therefore seeing things in ""JFK"" made me think otherwise to official story and a theory that was presented by the end by Jim Garrison sounded very, very convincing to me. So who actually killed Mr. Kennedy? Lets leave it to the history.<br/><br/>Overall, ""JFK. The Director's Cut"" is a superb drama in all directions. At running time 3 h and 20 min (!) it is, hear this - never boring or uninvolving for a second! The pacing (amazing editing), writing and directing are one of the kind and with a cast witch involves almost every well known face in a Hollywood this is a must see movie whether you like conspiracies or not. Great movie."
"Lechuguilla","9","3","7","4 April 2015"," Message Film With A Gripping Plot
","Will we ever solve the mysteries of the JFK assassination to everyone's satisfaction? No, I don't think so. LBJ's Warren Commission (WC), with cheer-leading from the mainstream press, tried to sell the public on the Oswald-as-lone-gunman idea. After a brief, national acceptance, the public began to question the WC conclusions. Ever since, the public's collective belief that Oswald acted alone, as measured by opinion polls, has been trending steadily downward.<br/><br/>The general impression is that the WC did not set out to find the truth. Instead, they set out to build a case that Oswald acted alone, a man who had long since been silenced by Jack Ruby. The WC built their lone-gunman case by cherry-picking those bits of information that would fit their predetermined conclusions. But an excess of bizarre coincidences, torturous logic, and massive inconsistencies of every sort in every facet of this multifaceted case overwhelm officialdom's weak arguments, and make the mainstream press look sheepishly beholden to Washington insiders.<br/><br/>The script's arguments for a conspiracy are compelling. Unfortunately, Stone's script tells the story from Jim Garrison's POV. Garrison's case against Clay Shaw was tenuous, at best. Result: officialdom and the press ... pounce. That Shaw may not have had a proved link to the assassination, however, does not in any way, plug up the massive holes in the conclusions of the Warren Commission. So a conspiracy is still a possibility, sans Garrison's theories. As a result, we're back where we started, with a silly lone-gunman theory, and some vague ""conspiracy"". What a mess!<br/><br/>As cinema, Stone's film is brilliant. The plot is gripping, riveting, mesmerizing. With an all-star cast, there's not a weak link in the bunch. Lighting is stylized and at times 1940's noirish. The dignified and profound musical score by John Williams enhances a tone of mystery and intrigue.<br/><br/>Editing is terrific. An enormous amount of information is telegraphed in the well-over three-hour production, information that could not have been included without split second cuts. As a result, the film's pace oscillates nicely between casual and rapid-fire.<br/><br/>A message film that persuasively demolishes the WC conclusions yet suffers from a too-literal belief in the Jim Garrison narrative, leaves us with a lot to think about. To a person with an open mind, the ""mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma"", as David Ferrie called it, is just as deep, just as profound now as it was fifty years ago. It probably always will remain such ... the stuff of legend."
"senortuffy","9","7","23","19 December 2003"," Historical drama about one of the most important events in our lifetime.
","""JFK"" opens with a clip of President Eisenhower delivering his famous farewell speech where he warns the American people about the pervasive power of the military industrial complex.  Director Oliver Stone treats it as an omen of things to come.<br/><br/>I'd seen this film when it was released theatrically and just the other day I rented the directors cut on video, and there's no other way to regard this film than as a masterpiece of American cinema.  No other event in recent history has impacted our lives more than the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  <br/><br/>Oliver Stone presents his theory about the events surrounding that November day, basing it all on verifiable facts that are meticulously presented throughout the film.  What he's saying is that a coup d'etat probably took place against the President of the United States and that it was carried out by people within our government who considered Kennedy a communist sympathizer and traitor.  The huge defense contracts that were contingent on our government pursuing a pro-war policy in Vietnam also were a factor in his assassination.<br/><br/>I'm not an expert on these matters.  I lived through the Sixties and vividly recall the day Kennedy was shot.  I also remember the aftershocks when Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy were assassinated in 1968.  Those were strange times and the American people weren't sophisticated enough to understand everything that was bubbling beneath the surface.  Oliver Stone has obviously researched this subject thoroughly, and I find his explanations very plausible.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best argument for a coup having occurred takes place when Donald Sutherland's character, a mysterious black ops ex-military man, explains it all to Jim Garrison during a walk around the Reflecting Pool in Washington. It's a terrific scene and one that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  This character puts everything into context, the history of the CIA from the end of World War II through the Cold War, and when he's done, you can't help but feel some people in our government had Kennedy killed.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is terrific.  Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the New Orleans attorney investigating the assassination, very well.  His closing argument in the trial of Clay Shaw where he presents all the evidence of a conspiracy to the jury is a classic scene. <br/><br/>
Besides Donald Sutherland, several other great actors take turns playing bit parts:  Walter Mathau plays a cynical Sen. Long, Ed Asner plays an ex-FBI agent turned rabid rightwinger with chilling accuracy, Jack Lemmon plays a drunken hanger-on, Gary Oldman is good as Lee Harvey Oswald.  There are many others but I can only name a few.<br/><br/>The blending of dramatic action and real news clips taken at the time is superb.  Oliver Stone builds his story scene by scene, revelation by revelation, until the dramatic ending where Garrison makes his case to the jury.  Only the most stubborn, ignorant viewer could disagree with his conclusion that a coup d'etat took place that day.  The idea that Oswald acted alone is just plain ludicrous.<br/><br/>Kennedy's assassination is the greatest mystery of our time.  Will we ever learn the truth or has it been buried forever?  I'd like to believe we're strong enough as a nation to survive the shock of knowing what really happened, but I have my doubts whether the government will ever release the files locked up.<br/><br/>Until then, this movie will have to stand as the defining explanation of what happened November 22nd, 1963."

Having said that, I must agree with those reviews which state that Stone quite forgot to put a disclaimer at the very start of this horrors of a movie that he had mostly wildly invented most of the plot and much of that is pure imagination land, not more So, any redeeming feature? Nope, I was not impressed by equally dismal performance of Kevin Costner, not was Dobald Sutherland more better or persuasive. Result--> This is the most overrated movie"
"KingBrian1","7","2","4","26 April 2017"," The ultimate Conspiracy Theory
","Director Oliver Stone does it again with another brilliant movie this time the conspiracy of who shot President JFK. The subject matter is already intense and fascinating, so many documentaries about the assassination. What you get with this movie is a mystery. So many people wanted JFK dead and this film brings it all to the fore. The political undertones to this film does have the effect of discouraging the non political to disengage. For those people this movie is boring. For those who appreciate a good mystery like myself the value of describing the participants in the cover up and the shoddy police work that occurred does a great service in showing us a real clear picture of 60's Texas. The drawback which is a feature of Stone's work is the preaching of the protagonist. Aside from that small aspect the film stands on its own as a great thriller. People are free to make up their mind as to whether or not JFK was indeed killed by an inside agent or a mercenary hired Oswald to take the hit. As an intellectual movie that serves to inform the public of the misdeeds of public officials i would say Oliver Stone has provided a valuable contribution to American democracy."

"blubb06","8","7","24","30 December 2007"," A cinematic masterpiece - based on bogus history
","Even after more than 15 years, Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" remains a stunning masterpiece of storytelling. Mixing reality and fiction, color and black & white snippets beyond the point of information overload, it's the precursor of ultra-rapid cut political thrillers like the ""Bourne Identity"". It is also a statement on the power of movies. Largely modeled after the book ""On the Trail of the Assassins"" by Jim Garrison, the New Orleans prosecutor who provides the heroic figure for ""JFK"" and has become famous as the only one who ever brought the Kennedy assassination to trial, it promotes the idea that the JFK case - maybe along with the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and even Martin Luther King - is really solved, if you watch/read the two in sequence. The book got a major interest boost from the film.<br/><br/>According to various evaluations I found on the net, a majority of Americans actually take most of ""JFK's"" assertions as facts, while of course expecting small artistic liberties. I did so myself, having read Garrison's book. One cannot help but wonder, if these ""facts"" are true, why are they not investigated? There are entire websites devoted to ""debunking"" conspiracy ""myths"", but their common mistake is usually to make the reader angry or flatly refuse to acknowledge the validity of questions. On the other hand, would the alleged dark government forces really use such a bunch of losers for the hit of the century? Since Jim Garrison's book is the source of most of ""JFK's"" claims, its credibility rests on Garrison's shoulders. The movie's hero is accused of pressurizing and even drugging witnesses, persecuting people for their homosexuality, wasting taxpayer's money etc. All of these claims seem ridiculous and are either attributed to a hostile press, a tired wife, a public won over by the Warren Report or government pressure... Garrison really had to fight all the demons of hell at once to get the truth out! Except that it wasn't really that way. Google up ""The Assassination Goes Hollywood!"" for a step-by-step debunking of ""JFK"" that doesn't make you mad at first glance. Delve deeper and the picture of Jim Garrison - and his times - changes entirely.<br/><br/>One of the movie's most subtle, but most basic distortions is the claim that everybody believed in the Oswald ""myth"" from the start, at the latest after the Warren Report. In reality, conspiracy ""myths"" sprang to life almost instantly, and a large majority of the public was not satisfied with the official explanations, just like today. Garrison wasn't the only one ""investigating"" and speculating, not even the most vocal. Public pressure eventually forced a commission to re-investigate the facts.<br/><br/>Numerous books have been written on the Garrison trial: ""False Witness"" by Patricia Lambert and ""American Grotesque"" by James Kirkwood, among others. ""Garrison has made a comeback that would have made Richard Nixon proud"", writes a commentator. They all conclude that Garrison whitewashed his investigation and misrepresented important details of the trial (errors that were faithfully repeated - and artfully inflated - by Oliver Stone). Garrison tried for years and failed, not because of a small missing piece of evidence for a ""guilty"" verdict, but because in reality, the jurors thought he had no case - absolutely nothing to credibly back up even the smallest of his claims, which had grown ever more sensational over time. The press, who would have loved anything spectacular, had abandoned him before the trial was over. Serious reporters and conspiracy buffs alike didn't take him seriously anymore. It took ""JFK"" to resurrect him.<br/><br/>There remains the issue of - the real - Clay Shaw, who looks guilty as hell on screen. The movie states before the end credits roll that CIA director Richard Helms later admitted that Shaw had worked for the CIA. That's not true. All Shaw was ever ""convicted"" of was being homosexual, which was confirmed by some of his acquaintances, and that he owned some sadomasochistic equipment. Count the number of homosexual suspects in the movie, and the claim that Garrison believed in a ""gay plot"" looks less incredible. Whatever Garrison may have thought, Shaw's forced ""coming out"" cost him dearly in social status. Shaw (and Ferry) are dead now. Is it true that in the United States, the laws of defamation apply only to the living? <br/><br/>Memory is fleeting, film is forever.<br/><br/>On the whole, all of ""JFK's"" central claims turn out to be pure myths, yet there is hope that some day one version of what really took place will be generally accepted, and it will be the right one. The merit of any controversial film is that it encourages discussion - and maybe research on the part of the viewer. There is nothing wrong with purely enjoying a good movie, as long as it's taken with a grain of salt."

"bob the moo","Null","8","29","13 April 2004"," It may not be fact but Stone delivers with pace and easily grips for pretty much the whole running time
","November 22nd, 1963. Dallas, Texas. The 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy is shot dead as he goes through the city in his motorcade. After initial doubts about the official conclusions on the incident, New Orleans DA Jim Garrison opens up an investigation into the assassination. He uncovers clues to a conspiracy that seems to come from the very top but witnesses are hard to come by and the further through the looking glass he goes the more danger he puts himself and his family in.<br/><br/>Watching an Oliver Stone film can be a wearying experience at times. Often the effect of his films can be like have him standing in front of you shouting for a couple of hours, however here his style is perfectly set with a script that, whether you believe it or not, pulls you along at a terrible pace.  As a piece of fact this film is bogus and it is up to each viewer to decide how much of it they want to accept or dismiss, but if you based your opinions on this film alone then you are too easily led.  What it does do though is present a vast number of questions for you to take away, and it does that very well.  The story relies heavily on theory, suggestion and characters who are combination of many, many small sources (combined for obvious reasons in the context of story telling).<br/><br/>It is a problem that this is presented as fact but I can forgive Stone that as he delivers it in such a thrilling manner.  The story rarely lets the pace drop and the `facts' come thick and fast as we go deeper into Stone's `truth'.  It is a breath taking ride and one that benefits from great direction, fantastic editing and a great mix of footage and stock.  In the middle of this is a near-faultless performance from Kevin Costner.  As I write this it is the accepted norm to hate him and every film with him in it - I don't entirely know why, but regardless he is great here.  The perfect example of what he brings to the film is in the 20-minute courtroom scene where he is mesmerising.  Hate him or not, it is impossible not to acknowledge his contribution to this film being so gripping.<br/><br/>Costner is supported by a great cast who do well regardless of their characters.  Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci have the least palatable characters in the film but they deliver them very well.  Oldman plays his patsy very well and Garrison's team includes performances from Rooker and Sanders that help the tension and pace.  Bacon is as good as ever, as is Sutherland and they stop you thinking that their characters are fictional. Turns from Matthau, Lemmon D'Onofrio, Vince, Candy and Knight are also great value.  There isn't really a weak link in the film - each performance seems to add urgency to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this film will put many off as it really appeals to those who are open to ideas or love conspiracy theories.  If you aren't one of these then the film may just irritate you but, whether you accept it as fact or not (I don't) it is still very interesting and is presented with such wonderful style and vigour by Stone and made all the better thanks to a series of good performances led by a real killer from Costner."
"JonMilo","Null","6","20","16 January 1999"," Scary for the wrong reasons.
","First of all this is a good movie; very absorbing and an excellent cast. But I am disturbed because of some viewers reaction to the film, not the actual content.  This film and Garrison's views and morals have been questioned from all corners including some of the most outspoken Conspiracy theorists. The film gives time to every hair-brained theory ever dreamed up and everyone (except Garrison) is implicated, (including the Judge, the Jury, LBJ, The Press and even Garrison's own staff).   It covers and glorifies Garrisons persecution of Clay Shaw (who was a real person and was ruined by Garrison) which still today is looked upon with shame in Southern Politics and Law practises. Some of the Assistant DA's on Garrison's staff were so sickened by these events (and others) that they quit law and have since written books to at least try and re-dress the story. So you see, to watch this film and come away with a sense of ""Gee  ain't Jim Garrison great?"" is truly hienous.  Oliver Stone has often commented on the Press's ability to put their own spin on things, but he must have known when researching and making the film that a lot of the ""Evidence"" is so obviously fabricated.  The fact that he has used this to spin  what is a real and very important story in the syle of a documentary is offensive to me. That's what's scary; a film that can make a guilty man innocent, an innocent man guilty and glorify the man responsible in such a convincing way."

"beuchertk","1","6","21","28 February 2014"," A travesty Pure fiction from one certifiably ignorant filmmaker
","It should be a tipoff when one learns that Stone refused to buy the screen rights to his favorite hokum conspiracy book because he thought the price too high. So he blithely bought the rights to another hokum conspiracy tome, and then disregarded everything it said. This film is based on commonly held mistaken beliefs and ridiculously inane conspiratorial delusions. My favorite instance of this nonsense is Walter Matthau's knowingly smug remark that Oswald couldn't hit the side of barn while firing a rifle in the Marine Corps. The records clearly show he was a very good shot (not that he had to be in order to hit a target at less than 100 yards with a scope!!!!) and I can personally verify that no Marine recruit ever gets out of basic training without showing a fair degree of marksmanship. The other outstanding fraud is when Costner claims that the Zapruder film shows Kennedy's head moving back at impact of the third bullet, when in fact it clearly displays a sudden, short, forward movement at impact, followed by a large backward jerk because of the sudden straightening of the JFK's body due to massive muscle contraction (which of necessity jerked his head up and back). The movie totally ignores the physical evidence and dispenses pure fraud. Everyone who deals in such matters knows that a bullet has no ability to force the human body to make drastic reactionary movements. A bullet drills a nice neat hole thru the human body but it only weighs around an ounce and cannot displace a 20 pound human head. Newton knew that 350 years ago - Stone is clueless about laws of motion and inertia. The JFK assassination is about as completely understood as any important crime can be. There simply are no mysteries about the case.<br/><br/>Reality is not Hollywood's strong point. Nor is accurate history, even in the best of cases. Oliver Stone has produced a piece of unmitigated historical and logical nonsense that serious students of the JFK assassination can only laugh at, make fun of, and wonder why our country has so many gullible and illogical moviegoers. Fortunately for Oliver Stone, all those slandered folks who would normally sue him for every cent he's got, are dead and buried. He knew he couldn't prove anything his movie said. Costner should be ashamed for being part of this travesty. And Matthau as well. My opinion of their ethics put them on my ""Never watch"" list of actors."

"Jeremy Bristol","7","6","21","16 March 2002"," Stone the Hypocrite
","As a movie, taken simply as a movie, JFK is a very good movie (and I don't even like Stone--he continually decries the (news) media, yet doesn't realize that he himself creates a form of media, a very powerful media that can be just as misleading and untruthful as any news program).  But too many people treat this movie as some kind of proof, but in the end, there is a major contradiction.  The movie makes the point that the truth will not be known until the Warren Commission's papers come out, yet the movie repeatedly refers to altered documents and testimony within those reports (how does anybody know that, anyway?).  What truth will come out of doctored history?<br/><br/>And here we come to the main thing that's wrong with JFK--its undying belief in its own ""truthfulness,"" despite the fact that it is a movie--a total fabrication, no matter how accurate its sources are.  Maybe I'm a bit more sensitive than I should be about the subject of truth and memory, having taken classes in Creative Non-fiction and Memoirs and discussed quite often in various classes the accuracy of memory and point of view (check out Robin Hemley's memoir, ""Nola,"" or David Eggers' ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius""), but I think Stone and Garrison weren't shining enough skepticism on eyewitness testimony and the memories, which would have given the movie true didactic balance.  After all, if Stone wants us to examine our ""rulers"" more closely, then shouldn't we examine everything more closely?<br/><br/>On a personal note, the dedication at the end irks me.  For one thing, Oliver Stone is older than my father.  But more importantly, he links youth to change as if every young person has exactly the same opinion and are by their very nature slowly progressing to some better state of who knows what. I'm sorry, but I know a lot of young people who fear change just as much as the old crones Stone seems so deadset against, and I know a lot of swinging people older than Stone that are even more about changing the world than the young people around me.  Those kinds of broad statements marr what could have been the greater truthfulness of JFK--not what really happened to the president, but what it was really like to live during those events.<br/><br/>I don't know what happened to Kennedy, and nobody will ever be satisfied with the truth if it ever comes out (despite what Stone says, the media feeds off conspiracy theories and unexplained events--there are still reports of Elvis sightings and UFOs).  What I do know I think I know is that John F. Kennedy was not the saint the Hippies and (oh god!) the MEDIA make him out to be.  The constant Julius Caesar/Brutus/Judas references were tiresome to me, and I thought I'd laugh my ass off when Kevin Costner told us to ""remember our fallen king.""  Seems to me Oliver Stone bought into the media perception of JFK."

","""I don't want to quibble over details. Read Gerald Posner's _Case Closed_ for the (probable) truth of the matter, but as a film, you may never see anything more dynamic and manipulative.<br/><br/>""Like 'Birth of a Nation' (1915), this is history 'written with lightning,' and as Wilson intended, that can be taken as either a positive comment or a negative one. Like Griffith's racist tirade, 'JFK' is full of misconstructed and ill-conceived ideas, and tells its warped story in a way many another filmmaker would envy. Stone is controversial -- as Griffith was -- and for good cause. But he's a dynamic, original talent. All his films -- 'The Hand' excluded -- bear witness to this. 'JFK' may be his piece de resistance."" -- 2002<br/><br/>In the six years since I wrote the above comments, I have done more reading on the assassination of John Kennedy. Of course, in assessing a film it must be remembered that even the most documentary-like of documentaries is a fictional construction. In other words, the truth of what the film is depicting should not be brought in to the discussion. <br/><br/>For example, you can't fault 'Pearl Harbor' (or 'Tora Tora Tora,' for that matter) for getting the history wrong, because it is only an entertainment, and cannot ever hope to emulate the reality of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Writers and directors make choices about what they present us, even if it's only one take rather than another. Furthermore, feature films are, on some level, an art form, even the really bad ones like 'Pearl Harbor.' <br/><br/>That being said, the truth of what happened in Dallas just after noon on November 22, 1963 should not, by rights, be allowed to influence one's perception of a feature film. <br/><br/>But because 'JFK' was and remains so popular, the reality of the case should be mentioned in any responsible discussion of the film. <br/><br/>From the beginning, there have been people who believe there was some sort of conspiracy involved in the murder of JFK. The simple fact is, there was not. Read Gerald Posner's 1993 _Case Closed_ for a relatively easy restatement of that, with convincing details... or if you're ambitious, and can stand his sarcasm and condescension, read Vincent Bugliosi's recent _Reclaiming History_. Bugliosi has a substantial chapter about this film that refutes the crap Stone presents as fact. Everyone one who believes in this movie's conclusions should read this chapter, if not the entire 1,600 page book. <br/><br/>Frighteningly, 'JFK' had a 'study guide' prepared for its use in classrooms. The fact that Stone is glorifying a DA who not only abused his power in an effort to get and remain in the public eye, but was also possibly insane, should preclude this film being used in anything other than a film theory class. It is NOT history (although it's probably a good version of how Jim Garrison himself might have remembered his 'crusade' against Clay Shaw), it is a tour de force of the filmmaker's art. Even the acting is good... one just wishes an 'A-list' director would film the JFK assassination without the conspiracy crap to both muddy the waters and confound the viewer.<br/><br/>Conspiracies are fun to believe in, but they're not a part of what really happened that day. I have downgraded my rating of 'JFK'. Despite its technical mastery, the way this film has warped the public's perception of JFK, Jim Garrison, Lee Harvey Oswald and Clay Shaw, I cannot honor this film with a high rating, any more than I can honor Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda piece 'Triumph of the Will'. The shear evil of the latter film knocks at least three points off it. 'JFK' loses two points and now gets a '4'. 2 February 2008"
"jubilee77","1","8","32","13 April 2008"," There was no plot
","I am entitled to submit fresh new comments about Stone's JFK. This film had managed to collect two Oscar awards due to the fact that it is well made and the reconstructed 1960s scenes are very good featuring Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison, the DA in ""search for a truth"" in the wake of the Kennedy assassination in 1963. Since Garrison arrived at the scene, these terrible events at Dallas had since then been a subject for conspiracy theories and it intensified when this film came out 28 years later. In spite of all those endless conspiracy theories about the assassination, it seems obvious there was no conspiracy. Now what about the film itself? Being directed by Oliver Stone, many of Oliver Stone's films focusing real life events have since then become subjects for love/hate theories and JFK is a classic example due to the fact that it is notorious for lots of inaccuracies as shown on such website; The Assassination Goes To Hollywood. The film is also misleading for the showing of Garrison as a hero ""searching for the truth"" but by the look of the real Garrison, he was actually some sort of oddball probably seeking publicity. Even the weaknesses of Stone's JFK can be traced to its filming stages when the press began to get their claws out claiming Garrisons's investigations to be a fraud and saying that Garrison was a bizarre DA from New Orleans whom said that the assassination was carried out as part of the CIA cover-up, he even managed to put a hapless man on trial. Not surprisingly, Garrison having no case lost in court. At nearly 3.5 hours in length, the film is too long and had initially became a turn-off by some family members due to considerable use of bad language. It seems to be without doubt that with a twisted mind, Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and had once attempted to assassinate General Edwin Walker. Oswald took employment at Deeley Plaza and some close-up cine clips on the youtube website of the shooting showed that it can only come from that direction and not from Grassy Knoll as the film seems to claim. Oswald gained shooting skills while serving as a marine that took him to the early days of the Cold War regime in the Soviet Union and was the only known person to have bolted from Deeley Plaza shortly after the shooting and had been initially been charged with the murder of JD Tippit and then Kennedy. Police Officer Jim Leavelle whom escorted Lee Harvey Oswald when Oswald was in turn shot by Jack Ruby pointed out that these shootings happened in bizarre circumstances (I would say) and added that there was no conspiracy. Leavelle also went onto say that much of these dismissed conspiracy theories about the Kennedy assassination were mostly by those whom weren't even born at that time. Oliver Stone's JFK may have been well made as already stated and well-received by film critics along with the conspiracy geeks while disappointed historians dismiss it for being deliberately misleading. While sounding believing true, the endless conspiracy theories (or a plot) are just based on pure speculation. As already stated, these events of 1963 just happened in bizarre circumstances. Now will we leave Kennedy rest in peace."

The director's manipulation of the audience is impressive, but only in the way Rupert Murdoch, for example, uses his media empire to manipulate voters. Now we know just how much Stone wilfully distorted facts and lied. The message of the film is all-important. And, being a lie, what's the point? All the acting is first-rate, and I'm sure many of the members of this stellar cast still see it as a worthy addition to their CV. It is, it must be said, a masterful use of the tools of cinema. With all the subtlety of a brick, Stone has perpetrated one of the biggest crimes in cinema. I will never go to another Oliver Stone film after discovering what he did with this film."

","It was commonly said that one must be off-balance to believe that a conspiracy was behind the assassination of JFK. However, when considering the magnitude of cover-ups, lies, related killings and the subsequent coup, what could be less rational than believing the corporate media's presentation of the 'single bullet' theory? Actually, I did see the magic bullet theory in action once. It was during an episode of one of the Looney Tunes cartoons. The bullet, which had a mustache and a hat, stopped completely in mid-air, looked around for the new direction of the intended target, made a right-angle turn, then continued in pursuit at full speed. While that did not necessarily vindicate Arlen Specter and the Warren Commission, it provided a humorous look at their incredible insult to the intelligence of the American people. This film was very well-made and was a rare moment of being offered reality instead of Disneyland. Rev. Bookburn, Radio Volta, Philadelphia"
"greggwager","10","6","22","5 March 2005"," Great Film, Flaws and All; But Did it Achieve what it Set Out to Do?
","I first saw ""JFK"" in Germany, with the same German actor who dubbed Costner in ""Dances with Wolves"" dubbing him here as Jim Garrison. All of the New Orleans accents were obviously lost, along with half of the flavorings that Stone used to make the incredible amount of information go smoothly into the ears of an American audience. Just the same, I was hooked by this film and recognized it as one of the most important films ever made, along with its flaws, not to mention a great way for Americans to finally see in detail the Zapruder film.<br/><br/>In my travels throughout Germany, I ended up in Berlin as a doctoral student and to my surprise, discovered that my Berlin school had a John F. Kennedy Library, where I spent much of my free time. With great German efficiency, this library had a pristine copy of the Warren Commission transcripts displayed in a prominent place and I proceeded to read carefully the first four or five volumes, while scanning the rest. It was an ironic backdrop to read the transcripts here because I know our American press has taken great pains to downplay the Kennedy Presidency, even attacking Kennedy's character. I don't think most Americans are aware of how much West Berliners loved Kennedy, dare I say even more than their own German leaders. Kennedy, after all, saved West Berlin on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>In light of Oliver Stone's film, one sees clearly even more bizarre things about the Kennedy assassination as depicted in the Warren Commission transcripts. No, even if you were taken by it, Stone's version of events should never be taken as anybody's final word about the assassination--it is a Hollywood film. Tom Wicker's claim that it is propaganda does not do it justice either. Propaganda is deliberately and consciously misleading an audience in an attempt to beguile them toward a political end. How could anyone think that Stone's beliefs weren't genuine? But the film is flawed. It's hard to believe Stone read the Warren Commission transcripts. If he had, some more details might have proved valuable to his essay. For example, I was absolutely floored when I read Oswald's mother's sprawling testimony in which she states that she believed that her son was an agent for the United States and was recruited when he joined the Civil Air Patrol, although she couldn't say how and didn't name David Ferrie (he is mentioned only superficially in the transcripts). She goes on to explain that there was another picture of Oswald with his rifle raised above his head, but that she and Marina burned it in their hotel room the night of the assassination (which would tend to disprove the theory that those photos were faked). <br/><br/>Critics of the conspiracy theories also can't believe that a great American like Earl Warren would have participated in a cover up. The truth is, many of the Warren Commission members didn't show up regularly to the hearings and when Warren was absent, Alan Dulles (the ex-CIA Director that Kennedy fired) ran the investigation--an important detail that is too often overlooked. Details of how President Johnson, the Warren Commission, and even the 1977 HRSC investigation was manipulated via a sophisticated method of kibbitzing can be found in the new book by Jim DiEugenio and Lisa Pease (""The Assassinations,"" Feral House, 2003).<br/><br/>Besides the information from the Warren Commission transcripts, Stone could have taken more time to explain specifically and precisely how the Bay of Pigs fiasco provided the means and motive for the assassination. It was only in Stone's movie about Nixon that the secret team of Cubans (named by Stone as ""Track One""; perhaps the same group known as ""Operation 40,"" which was probably designed to be a post-Castro Cuban intelligence organization) came to light. Americans should always remember that Eisenhower passed the planning of the Bay of Pigs invasion to his Vice-President, Richard Nixon, thinking that Nixon would win the Presidency in 1960. Important details of Nixon's plan (i.e., Operation 40 or Track One) were withheld from Kennedy. This wasn't simply an inept operation; it was the crux of the Kennedy Presidency: ""who's in charge here?"" Stone also tries to downplay the incident with Sylvia Odio as a staged event, when in actuality, this could be a big piece to the puzzle. Oddly enough Stone shows the Gary Oldman Oswald talking to Odio and the fake Frank Whaley Oswald later with the same Cubans, calling Odio from a phone booth. Odio swears she recognized the real Oswald with these Cubans visiting her house.<br/><br/>As entertainment, the success of this movie is off the charts. Unfortunately, it doesn't entirely succeed what it sets out to do: reverse the course of history like no other film has ever done. Stone has put a dent in the American dialog about the assassination of JFK, but unfortunately he can't put the matter to rest. A few years ago, when Governor Jesse Ventura stated that he believed the military industrial complex conspired to kill Kennedy, TV journalists Chris Matthews and Matt Lauer both rolled their eyes and publicly crucified him. Matthews even gives us the tired old adage (source unknown) that people who believe in a Kennedy assassination conspiracy were ""educated on a bar stool"" (a variation of which is used in Clint Eastwood's 1993 ""In the Line of Fire""--perhaps a cryptic rebuttal to Stone). Had Stone's film succeeded in what it set out to do, all of us would be able to state the assassination of John F. Kennedy was, as Rudolf Augstein has said, the most important political assassination since Julius Caesar and anyone who believes American democracy is important would recognize Kennedy as a President of the same stature as Abraham Lincoln, not because of his abilities, but because he stepped into his job at a crucial test of Democracy--did he really fail?"

","Whether you buy Stone¬¥s theory regarding the murder of JFK or not, this is one of the best movies ever made.

I have read neither Garrissons nor Prouty¬¥s books, but it¬¥s an amazing amount of facts that are squeezed into these 3 short hours.<br/><br/>The momentum of this movie is outstanding.

The structure of timelayers feels almost like a cubist painting by Picasso where you¬¥re able to see every dimension at the same time.<br/><br/>Another well deserved Oscar went to one of my favourite cinematographers of all time, Bob Richardson. Similar to Natural Born Killers, another Stone-Richardson collaboration among many, he plays with various filmstocks and formats, fooling your eye to the extent that the re-enactment of JFK¬¥s murder feels almost documentary. The overhead lighting at Antoine¬¥s Restaurant, the shifts and fades when Garrison is reading the Warren Report, the use of light hot-spots giving you that white ""fuzz""....  The list goes on and on.<br/><br/>The cast is flawless. This is really an ensemble movies although Costner, who¬¥s never been better before or since, is the major star. The movie benefits from not being packed with A-list stars, which I believe would have reduced the sense of ""reality"". It feels as if Oldman was born to play Lee Harvey Oswald.

I get just as frustrated with Rooker¬¥s character every time I see the movie, a perfect casting.<br/><br/>As was not surprised when this movie did not win the Academy Award for Best Movie, since it¬¥s far to politically incorrect for Hollywood¬¥s taste.

"ironhorse_iv","7","4","13","25 November 2013"," Paranoid conspiracy theorists will love this movie, while other will see it as grotesque falsification and distortion of a national tragedy.
","JFK is a political thriller film directed by Oliver Stone that gives up an interesting account on why President John F. Kennedy was assassination in Dallas, TX in Nov. 22, 1963. While, the events leading up to the true real life event is still a mystery and the facts gather up on the case wouldn't be disclose until 2017 and 2029. Oliver Stone gives us his take on what happen, why and how the government might be covering it up in the eyes of former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner). From all the assassination conspiracy theories out there ranging from Mafia connections to Cuba exiles, Oliver Stone picked up one that is a bit outlandish to base his movie around. Oliver Stone largely based his movie on New Orleans DA Jim Garrison's book ""On the trail of the Assassins"". Jim Garrison's story first off, wasn't a real good choice for a movie. The movie does take a big dramatic license in this story. Stone's depictions of Garrison is that of a fearless seeker of truth who seeking revenge out on New Orleans resident Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) who Garrison charged with conspiring with Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) to assassinate Kennedy. In reality, Garrison was a paranoid, irrational bully who persecuted Shaw in conspiracy so vase it's hard to believe. While other critics might see this as all a misrepresentation of the truth, in my opinion, I really have doubts that this conspiracy theory really happen, but it might had. I'm more open to seeing this movie, than a lot of people, but still can't comprehend the uneven 'facts' the movie is projecting. It didn't help that years later, science would prove most of these claims to be unrealistic. The state-of-the-art forensic and computer analysis of the assassination since 1991, clearly shows that Oswald might had acted alone. All the findings have been consistent with the autopsy findings and demonstrate that both hits- the Kennedy-Connally first shot, and the fatal head wound third shot were fired from the 6th floor window of the Texas Book Depository, not from the picket fence or grassy knoll. The first shot passed through the president and then the governor in a relatively straight line, not the zigzag claimed by the movie Garrison. It's hard to think that Oswald was part of a conspiracy as he was known before the event as a loose-cannon. Oswald was originally trying to kill a general that day, not the president. The film says he was poor marksman, but in real life, he was quite good in his markings. About, Jack Ruby's action were a bit driven by his passion for the president. He did it for revenge. It's hard to think a strip club owner Ruby (Brian Doyle Murray) was part of a conspiracy even if he was part of the Mafia. In the film he's depicted surreptitiously planting the 'magic bullet' on a hospital gurney. The biggest out there claim the film has is the film's implication that President Lyndon B. Johnson was part of a coup d'√©tat to kill Kennedy. Ouch. The idea of that is preposterous in 1991 as it is today, as Lyndon pretty much had no reason to kill Kennedy and Stone knew it. The movie explains Kennedy was assassinated because his foreign policy would have meant diminished profit for the military-industrial complex, and enraged high-ranking military officials who viewed such diplomacy as weakness. This is hardly the case, as Kennedy was indeed one of the men that help the build-up of the military during the Cold War and help put the space race into play that made more profit than ever before. I had study the Warren Commission, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations to the best of my ability, and I just can't find myself, putting Clay Shaw with John F. Kennedy together. The movie also takes some information accounts from Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs as a counter-myth to the Warren Commission's fictional myth. What the movie does so well, is mixing the real life footage with that of the fictionist story as it looks like a veneer of documentary verisimilitude. No wonder, why the film won best editing and cinematography at the Academy Awards. Before the age of the internet, this was the first time, I have ever saw the brutal Zapruder footage. It was really was intense. It's really hard to tell, what is real and what isn't when watching this film. The acting in this cast was really good. The length of the movie is pretty hard to get through if not a history buff. Its 3 hours long, and most of the movie is talking. . It's even worst in the Director's Cut version as there is nearly 54 minutes worth of deleted and expanded scenes. It was a bit too long and excessively detailed. It could be more concise. Overall: a lot of people still believe that JFK die in a conspiracy theory matter. So this movie will continue to find an audience wanting to know more about the event."
"pyrocitor","5","6","23","20 December 2007"," Flawed but intriguing rumination on political events
","No one could ever expect a cinematic representation of historical events to be completely objective - film is an indisputably subjective medium, and the 'voice' of the director and producers are bound to always shine through. But objectivity is one thing, and Oliver Stone is its polar opposite. Instead of Stone's powerhouse film-making style and fierce political convictions adding substance and energy to JFK, his take on the infamous assassination and its aftermath, it is Stone's self-righteous and self-indulgent hammering of the material that inhibit the film from being the intelligent and compelling political investigation piece it could have been. As it is, while JFK could be considered a solid thesis on Stone's perspective on the events, as a film it struggles to hold up amidst the torrent of its own flaws. <br/><br/>Stone may never have had the pretense of disguising his perception of the events of the JFK assassination and the alleged ensuing conspiracy as cold hard fact, but he certainly seems determined to beat his audience over the head with his side of the story to the point of bewildered acceptance. Stone's incredibly forceful portrayal of his own perspective, pitching his film directly to heartfelt American sentiment (even going so far as to have Costner directly address the camera when speaking of American liberty) has the final outcome emerge as just a shade away from propaganda. Stone's work tends to attract a ""love it or hate it"" reaction, but with a film this shamelessly self-congratulating and painfully biased, it is distinctly hard to love it, plaudits or not. <br/><br/>Apart from Stone's own stance on the material, speaking strictly in film-making terms, JFK also finds itself lacking. Excruciatingly long and unreasonably ""talky"" (especially near the film's climax, where Kevin Costner talks for literally half an hour straight... no joke) and making use of an abundance of unreasonably clich√©d patriotic sequences enough to make one's stomach queasy, Stone's film is far too self-indulgent to make its proper effect. Seldom arises the complaint that a director needs to simplify their work, but given the relatively simple plot ensuing, Stone sure manages to complicate the hell out of it, clarified with a series of incredibly contrived play-by-plays by Garrison and his team. While it is abundantly clear that Stone has done his research on the case, and it is easy to get swept up in the story to a degree, one can't help but wish that he had not found it necessary to include every last scrap of information regarding it - as such, the film feels like it is overflowing at the seams with factual information, often thrust so rapid fire into the audience's face that they have no time to process or internalize it. It is a shame indeed that the content of the film is so disappointingly brought to life, as JFK's technical work is laudable indeed, making use of terrific cinematography and editing (although the initially effective montage sequences, complimented with real historical footage do grow tiresome after being steadily overused as the film progresses) even if the normally reliable John Williams' score overloads on patriotic musical clich√©s to a nauseating extent. <br/><br/>The astonishing array of talented actors substantially raise the quality of the film as a whole. While Kevin Costner as patriotic American everyman DA Jim Garrison is bland at best, painfully trite at worst and unquestionably given far too much screen time, the wonderful supporting cast are more than enough to carry the dead weight of the film's lead. Tommy Lee Jones, in a distinctly different role from his usual casting is electrifying as ominous influential businessman Clay Shaw, with a cold menace simmering beneath his character's flamboyant exterior. Gary Oldman of course effortlessly steals the show as alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald - seen mostly in flashbacks, Oldman's meticulous dedication in fully inhabiting his characters is used to chilling and compelling effect. Backed by dynamic performances from Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, John Candy and Walter Matthau, all superb when given their moment to shine, the film's supporting cast raises the bar in terms of quality considerably. Unfortunately, Sissy Spacek is wasted in a banal subplot as Garrison's wife, adding a nauseatingly by the numbers ""obsession endangers family life"" theme to an already overlong film. As Stone dollops on the sap and Spacek overacts to her heart's content, backed up by absurdly untalented child actors as their children, the family sequences are among the film's most painful and unnecessary. <br/><br/>Keeping in mind that appreciation of Oliver Stone's films does tend to be just as subjective as his own cinematic stance, it becomes difficult to dispute JFK being far too overlong, overstuffed with dialogue and bombarded by offensively clich√©d sequences to be anywhere near as effective as it ought to have been. While intriguing in its presentation of a distinctly one sided rumination on the events following the assassination and complimented with brilliant technical work and impressive performances from its supporting cast, Stone's distinctive slant is what drags the film down from being the taut political work it could have been, resulting in a fact bloated, lopsided and self-indulgent portrayal of American history.<br/><br/>-5/10"
"JohnSeal","5","6","23","21 April 2000"," A masterpiece of propaganda
","JFK is undoubtedly Oliver Stone's best film, a powerful piece of political filmmaking that is unfortunately so wide of the mark that it is ultimately a tremendous failure. Stone buys into the theories of the two least credible conspiracists, the egotistical Jim Garrison and the starry eyed Jim Marrs. There's no actor better suited to play Garrison than Kevin Costner, the man whose head seems to expand every time he's in front of a camera. Garrison also reflects the inflated ego of Stone himself, who seems to believe every half baked idea proposed in On the Trail of the Assassins. Also on display is Stone's usual penchant for homophobia, as his limpwristed villain Clay Shaw minces across the screen. (Apparently it wasn't enough that this utterly innocent man had already suffered character assassination in Garrison's book.)<br/><br/>The lowest blow of all, of course, was the casting of Jim Garrison himself as Chief Justice Earl Warren. To impugn Warren's honesty--and his importance as one of the great liberal jurists of this century--is bad enough, but to have a charlatan who questioned the man's character play him is truly despicable. <br/><br/>Terrrific photography and outstanding bit parts by Gary Oldman (a memorable Lee Harvey Oswald), Donald Sutherland, and the always reliable Michael Rooker make JFK a must see. It's on a par with Triumph of the Will or Olympiad 1936: truly one of the great propaganda pieces of the twentieth century."
"ackstasis","9","5","18","18 September 2009"," ""Let justice be done though the heavens fall""
","Oliver Stone's wildly-speculative conspiracy theory epic 'JFK (1991)' opens with a montage of archival footage depicting the presidency of John F. Kennedy, 35th President of the United States, up until 12:30PM on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. However, even before this historical prologue has come to an end, Stone has already introduced his own dramatisation ‚Äì a beaten prostitute, dumped on the side of a road, pleads that Kennedy's life is in danger. Her agonised cries play over familiar documentary footage of the Presidential motorcade. Already, Stone is defiantly blending fact and fiction, speculation and dramatisation. On its initial release, the film stirred enormous controversy due to its flagrant disregard for historical fact, but that's not what 'JFK' is all about. Oliver Stone may (or may not) genuinely believe all of Jim Garrison's conspiracy theories ‚Äì which implicate everybody up to former President Lyndon B. Johnson ‚Äì but his film nevertheless offers a tantalising ""what if?"" scenario, an unsettling portrait of the fallibility of ""history"" itself.<br/><br/>Having undertaken some light research, I don't feel that Garrison's claims hold much water. However, that doesn't detract from the film's brilliance. Crucial is Stone's more generalised vibe of government mistrust, the acknowledgement that political institutions are at least conceptually capable of such a wide-ranging operation to hoodwink the American public. 'JFK' also paints a gripping picture of its protagonist, torn between its admiration for a man willing to contest the sacred cow of US government, and its pity for one so hopelessly obsessed with conspiracy that it consumes his life, family and livelihood. Kevin Costner plays Garrison as righteous and stubbornly idealistic, not dissimilar to his Eliot Ness in De Palma's 'The Untouchables (1987).' The only difference is that Garrison is chasing a criminal far more transparent than Al Capone ‚Äì indeed, a criminal who may not exist at all. Costner is supported by an exceedingly impressive supporting cast, which includes Jack Lemmon, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, Michael Rooker, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Oldman.<br/><br/>With the Director's Cut clocking in at 206 minutes, 'JFK' is an epic piece of work. However, the film is so dazzlingly well-constructed that watching it becomes less of a choice than a compulsion. Stone frenziedly throws together seemingly-unrelated puzzle-pieces, systematically peeling back layer after layer of conspiracy until all that remains is what Jim Garrison believes to be the naked truth. Beneath the sordid details, Stone speculates on the nature of history itself. Archive footage blends seamlessly with dramatisation ‚Äì but what is recorded history but a re-enactment submitted by the winners? Not even the witnesses to Kennedy's assassination, clouded by subjective perception, can know for sure what exactly took place on that dark day in Dallas. Perhaps Zapruder's 486 frames of grainy hand-held footage (combined with that of Nix and Muchmore) represents the only objective record of the event ‚Äì but Antonioni's 'Blowup (1966)' showed that even photographic documentation is unreliable through the inherent bias of the viewer. In short, nobody knows what really happened that day. 'JFK' is Oliver Stone creating his own history ‚Äì or merely correcting it."
"sveknu","6","5","18","15 May 2005"," I won't believe it
","This movie follows Kevin Costner as a DA who tries to find out who killed president John F. Kennedy. Wait, wasn't that Lee Harvey Oswald? Not according to Mr. Jim Garrison (the DA). In the extensive investigation he starts, he comes up with several alternative theories about a conspiracy against Kennedy. In Garrison's opinion, Oswald was just a decoy for the operation. Personally, I'm no expert about the Kennedy murder at all. But these alternative theories makes this movie too speculative. An attempt to link the American weapons industry to the assassination seems ridiculous to me. It's even implied that Lyndon B. Johnson was involved. Get a grip, people. Another downside in this movie is that it lasts too long, more than three hours. The about 30 minutes long speech from Garrison in the court at the end should at least have been cut down by half."
"MovieAddict2016","Null","5","18","7 September 2004"," I didn't like it much the first time
","The second time I really enjoyed it, even if it's not historically accurate. But for the record I DO believe that there was a cover-up involving the assassination, many Europeans claim Americans are just ""afraid"" to admit the truth but that's not it -- the fact is that the theory of Oswald acting alone is almost unbelievably insane. First of all the whole thing stunk of conspiracy, there's a reason that even the most skeptical people in the world believe this was all a cover-up. I've seen countless documentaries from both sides about this with an open mind and I've always found the evidence on the cover-up side far more hefty.<br/><br/>There's the physical limitations for example. Stone might insert some lies but the truth is no person, Schwarzenegger or a meek little accountant, could EVER fire three shots in the time range that Oswald did. Stone says it's six seconds. It's actually eight. I saw a UK documentary trying to ""prove"" it was possibly by showing an old man firing three quick shots in 4.3 (I believe) seconds.<br/><br/>Yeah, that's easy. I can throw three stones in four seconds if I had to. But if I had to try and hit a moving target from a faraway distance from a high level partially hidden behind a tree branch, I don't think I could do it. Do YOU? <br/><br/>Then there's the fact that Oswald would have to literally rush all over the place as fast as Superman to be able to do the things they claim he did in the amount of time they claim he did.<br/><br/>Oh, and let's not forget the fact that JFK is shot and the bullet clearly enters from the FRONT, not from behind. ""But bodies can fly forward after being shot from behind,"" someone said.<br/><br/>Yeah, IF you're shot in the lower section of the body -- NOT the head, which -- and any doctor/scientist/whatever will tell you this -- snaps backward or forward depending on the motion of the impact.<br/><br/>Then there's the footage which shows crowds of people instinctively looking towards the grassy knoll. Oh, and the shots came solely from the book depository? And people are looking in the opposite direction because of ""echoes"" (as some people say)? And a number of witnesses saw men fleeing the scene from the direction of the grassy knoll?<br/><br/>This is just the beginning. No, Stone's film isn't flawless but it isn't TOTALLY lies -- a lot of it is truth, and this is coming from the guy who disliked BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY because of Stone's manipulating dishonesties.<br/><br/>See this movie. Great performances, great direction, and a fair amount of history, even if it's the most flawed aspect of the story.<br/><br/>I recommend downloading a guide to the film after seeing it, marking down the lies and then checking out all the truths left over. You'll be stunned, and then maybe you can draw your own conclusions.<br/><br/>As it is, this is a very good film about a very shameful event that I honestly believe was a total cover-up."

","Films like this really come along rarely, the type of film which is both engaging, well- paced and based on historical fact. Though the introduction may seem too slow a start for some people, I cannot find a single flaw in this film. The cinematography was excellent, earning the film one of its two Oscars and the acting was brilliant. Kevin Costner is very much on form and so is his support cast most notably, for me at least, Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald who really excels at showing the different aspects of the character as the film develops.<br/><br/>With the director's cut coming in at 3 hrs 18 mins, it may be slightly too long, but with a powerful story line this is not noticed as much as one might expect. Another frequent criticism is that the theories brought forward in the film are unfeasible, however they did not diminish the viewing experience for me and the twist scene, including Donald Sutherland(Yay!) was particularly strong.<br/><br/>Perhaps what is most noticeable and memorable is the use of old footage of events and black and white flash backs, both used to great effect throughout the film.

"Robert_duder","10","5","19","15 July 2006"," One of the most important, brilliant, controversial films ever made...the questions linger
","I think JFK by Oliver Stone is my favorite film of all time...period. I have finally made that decision. I base that on content and the sheer amount of times I could sit through it and it's as powerful each and every time. Although I also might say I am quite biased towards the film having been a Kennedy fanatic and researcher since my early teens. I love Kennedy and the whole mystery and intrigue surrounding his death on November 22nd, 1963. And no film captivates, captures and defines that assassination like Oliver Stone's brilliant film. While being fiction and dealing with a real life situation he makes such a controversial, detailed, full of depth film that it you could literally get something different from every single time you watch it and I have each time. The film should have swept the Oscar's and should be consider THE MOST controversial film because I believe it's the only thing that comes close to bringing out the truth behind the Assassination (that's not up for debate...I'm simply reviewing the film.) <br/><br/>Kevin Costner...some love him, some hate him...I have heard people describe Costner as drab, boring, unemotional, but I have never agreed. I love Costner's films and performances. I think he is an incredible talent of embodying the characters he portrays. He makes them real, he makes the every day guy no matter what the character is. He can be powerful, emotional, subtle, weak, misunderstood, ambitious, evil...I think he's a very diverse actor with underrated ability. I think his performance in this film as Jim Garrison is brilliant. There isn't a time yet in watching this film that I am not so incredibly moved as tears well up in Costner's eyes as he's giving his closing speech to the jury (rumoredly this was not planned but Costner felt the impact of his speech.) Costner captures the era and the important of Garrison's investigation and perfectly shows how this case completely consumed Garrison to the very end. The cast in this film is extensive, impressive and incredible. To name any one person and not another in this film seems almost unfair besides Costner as he is the main focus. Tommy Lee Jones is usually second to be headlined being he was nominated for his performance as Clay Shaw/Bertrand, the man accused of conspiracy in the President's murder and the only man ever to be brought to trial for such. Jones is brilliant, he's always brilliant, Tommy Lee Jones is one of the greatest actors of all time and this role is brilliant but it's a very, very small role. Cameo might even describe it but still he got his nominated as supporting actor and he is a big screen presence and him and Costner share some intense dialog. Gary Oldman is PHENOMENAL as Lee Harvey Oswald. The man is just brilliant in flash backs and recreations of actual news events. The voice, the look, everything about him is nailed and he has a very subtle brilliance and insanity to him and his look. Oldman should have gotten an Oscar hands down. Joe Pesci is also very good (although mostly typical Pesci as CIA contact David Ferrie.) He certainly nails the physical appearance and his performance is noteworthy and riveting. He definitely adds pizazz and excitement to the film with this high strung over the top personality. Kevin Bacon, Michael Rooker, Jack Lemmon, Laurie Metcalf, Sissy Spacek (in a notable role as Costner's estranged and upset wife,) John Candy, Jay O. Sanders, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, Edward Asner, and Wayne Knight are the bulk of the really notable performances in this film. All of them give so, so incredibly much to this film and make it come alive. Some of them have brilliant, detailed absolutely riveting monologues of information that any other time would come across as boring drivel and yet you watch and listen in awe as they list out the evidence. Bravo to each and every one of these actors because they made the most brilliant film ever made.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone is no stranger to controversy. He's a brilliant, no holds barred director who makes jarring and stirring films. I haven't liked all his films but I can't deny his directorial brilliance and this is chief proof of that. He took an age old debate, something that has been rehashed to death and created an intriguing study. The film has less of a story and more of laying out facts in front of you for three hours and he does it with absolute ease and makes it compelling and interesting to everyone...researchers, fanatics, and just the average movie goer. So many powerful speeches, and moments in this film will just leave you stunned and wanting to watch the whole thing again because there is just SO much to take in. Whether you believe the evidence or not it's just as compelling to watch Stone direct a brilliant cast into a controversial film. This is without a doubt one of the top ten films you absolutely cannot live without seeing. It's important both as a film and to real life. For me it's also my number 1 film of all time. Consider that the best of the best. As I stated I am biased given my love for the subject but the film is still BRILLIANT!! Capturing the sixties, the assassination, the trial, the witnesses, the cover up...it's all done with such impressive style. 10/10"

","This is a riveting movie from start to finish and the way it racks up the tension is, well, better than anything I've ever seen. An all-star cast, wonderful direction, top notch screenplay and suspenceful score. Of course, as 'history' we all know JFK is quite seriously flawed, but does that really matter? it's only a movie after all. Personally, I loved it. I've read the long and eloquent reviews of others and there's no point just repeating what other folks have already said, so here's my 'take' on the murder of President Kennedy. MY theory is that Lee Harvey Oswald was suffering from undiagnosed Aspergers Syndrome; a minor form of Autism. Look it up on the internet (if you're interested). It's the only thing - for me - that explains his character. Oswald was a highly intelligent man, but without focus. His (self taught) Russian was not only fluent but perfect. He joined the US Marine Corps, but was attracted to Communism and he was active in both the pro and anti castro movements. I think Oswald was involved in the murder (somehow) but my conclusion is he wasn't the only shooter and probably not a shooter at all. I think there WAS a conspiracy and shadowy people far more streetwise than Oswald easily picked him out as a tailor-made fall guy. Just a few hours before his death JFK said: ""We're heading into nut country today"". Dallas was a 'hostile' city, so how come his security was so lax? And despite the movie's many inaccuracies it did get one vital thing right. ""Back and to the left. Back and to the left"". The final shot which killed the President could never have been fired from behind the car. The anti conspiracy theorists always put forward the notion that (if it was a conspiracy) someone would've eventually confessed. I'd say, confessed to what? This movie presents the conspiracy as maddeningly 'vague' and I think that's bang on the nail. Each person involved would've only known as much as they needed to. No one person could ever prove anything. I was born 2 months after event, but my parents both told me they wept when they heard President Kennedy had been killed, just like many millions of people. despite his well documented sexual flaws I think JFK was a great man who could've given so much to the world. This movie is wonderful entertainment, but it also makes a viewer think too. All in all, excellent."

","This movie is entertaining but please don't use it for anything else. Stone has admitted to putting things in to spice it up a little. The movie business has to have a little ""BAM"" in the sauce and real life was just too bland.<br/><br/>As science improves, the old and amplified theories from the past start to dry up. Well this movie sure hydrates them farely well. I am sure some who fantasize about such things or want some elaborate story to a tragedy will use this movie as their battle cry, ""conspiracy, conspiracy I tell you!"".<br/><br/>This movie is about as factual as the Legend of Boggy Creek or maybe the incredible HULK. Its not a bad movie to watch but its no history lesson."
"Angry_Arguer","10","5","19","22 July 2003"," Eye of Dread
","Having reviewed The Silence of the Lambs, Terminator 2, and JFK for the first time in 10 years, I can easily say that JFK undoubtedly deserved its Oscar for Best Film Editing.  The film moves, flows, and never loses pace or interest.  Its three-hour length flies by at quickening speed and remains captivating to the audience, something Born on the Fourth of July couldn't do.  The use of multiple types of film also emphasizes its difference, something Oliver Stone couldn't have done five years before with Platoon.<br/><br/>Now comes the nuts and bolts of the film.  I will but blunt when I say this next part, but I am NOT watching this film for a history lesson!  If I want a history lesson, I'll contract one of Michael Moore's quack faux-documentaries (shame on you, Mr. Moore!) and take notes.  Otherwise, Oliver Stone creates an incredible film here that would have been stronger...if it were the truth.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner has obviously fallen in the public light since this film and his acting is lower grade than in The Untouchables.  Nonetheless, he portrays Jim Garrison with an almost quiet insanity.  Somewhere behind those glasses is a fierce animal waiting for the strike.  The remainder of the cast is not given enough to do other than be names we memorize and then forget.  Tommy Lee Jones presents an interesting multi-layered character that Stone obviously holds in contempt.<br/><br/>Overall, a brilliant film that--historical notes aside--shows how a modern movie should be made.  Kudos to Mr. Stone!  I forgive you for Heaven & Earth.  5 out of 5 stars."
"Quinoa1984","10","5","19","7 May 2003"," Back, and to the left....Stone's second best picture behind Born on the Fourth
","JFK (the director's cut version) is like a history lesson taught by an unconventional, usually thought provoking, and ultimately inspiring professor, transferred brilliantly onto celluloid.  In fact this film, which has been put down by various critics (not film critics mind you) for it's lack of truth and tendency to go off on conspiracy theories.  These critics, and there are plenty of them, entirely miss the point of the picture.  This is the ONLY kind of film that a film maker like Stone could make, one that is a challenge to the system, one that questions, and with questions that, after such a hefty lesson, makes a whole lot of sense. JFK is in reality a film ABOUT America, about the feelings that go with a national tragedy, the assumptions, the cover-ups, the fears, control, and head question- why?<br/><br/>Stone makes Jim Garrison, played by Kevin Costner in one of his few superb performances, as a man who starts off believing the Warren Commission following the assassination on the day 11/22/63.  Years later, he begins to get gradually drawn into the idea that a conspiracy could be, and after various interviews and queries, he finds that there may be more, his mind opened to the possibility of truth.  He takes Clayton Laverne Shaw, alias Clay Bertrand (played to a deserved Oscar nominated stance by Tommy Lee Jones), to court, that he was in cahoots with not only Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman), but much, much more.  <br/><br/>Personally, amongst other small items, I agreed with two main points on JFK - 1) there had to have been more than one shooter for the notion of the magic bullet theory, which states that a bullet went back and to the left, not to mention that the footage that shows this, within the film by Abraham Zabruder, is kept out of public view to this day.  2) in the exceptional cameo by Donald Sutherland as Mr. X, when he refers to the military industrial complex, and to the fact that in other parts of the world people already were hearing the entire history of Oswald was the killer before people in the United States even knew about the man, also to the black operations, which I definitely don't doubt exist.<br/><br/>However, by the end of the 205 minute investigative epic into the ""coup de-ta"" of our 35th president, even those who may question Garrison's (as well as Stone's) views can still see the film as a masterwork of feelings, an atmosphere of a specific time and mood of a country.  The photography and editing, both Oscar winning, make the film all the more compelling, spell-binding, and very much unforgettable.  Along with Sutherland's near show-stopping bit, other actors make very noteworthy appearances- Kevin Bacon, John Candy, Walter Matthau (in the plot thickening moment), Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, and especially Joe Pesci, who's eyebrows steal his scenes. Based on books by Garrison and Jim Morrs.  A++"

","Throughout the whole movie I was throughly engaged. Oliver Stone provided an excellent history of the Kennedy Presidency in the beginning of the movie. This gave the viewer a brief history without giving too many unnecessary details. Kevin Costner played the role of Jim Garrison very well. Garrison really wanted to find out who really killed Kennedy. The omitted details from the Warren Report were shocking. I was pleased how Stone tied all the conspiracies together in logical way. The movie was very easy to follow. For a movie that was almost three and a half hours, there was never really a dull moment. With all of the compelling detail and conspiracies, it was necessary for the movie to be this long. In the end of the movie the viewer is questioning the accuracy of the Warren Report. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys history and conspiracies."

"jcbutthead86","10","4","14","24 January 2014"," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Powerful,Unforgettable Masterpiece From Oliver Stone.
","JFK is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines amazing direction,a terrific all-star cast,a wonderful script and a brilliant and intense film score. All of those elements make JFK a classic political Thriller/Mystery,an outstanding piece of cinema and Oliver Stone at his best.<br/><br/>Based on the books On The Trail Of The Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire:The Plot That Killed Kennedy,JFK tells the story of Jim Garrison(Kevin Costner),a New Orleans District Attorney who is investigating the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy that happened on November 22,1963. While some think it was just Lee Harvey Oswald(Gary Oldman)alone that did the shooting,Garrison thinks that there was others involved and that there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy and Jim Garrison is investigating the events that lead up to the assassination.<br/><br/>Released in 1991,JFK is an amazing film that was controversial even before was released into movie theaters and is still one of the most controversial films of all time because some critics and the media felt that director Oliver Stone was taking liberties with historical facts and events. Whether anyone will see the film as fact or fiction,JFK is a brilliant film on every level,a thought-provoking masterpiece that punches you in the face right from the beginning grabbing you by the throat and never letting viewers go until the very end and is a movie that is an assault on the senses and the mind. JFK is also an intense Mystery-Thriller and one of the best Mystery-Thrillers ever made that is filled with intensity and with white hot suspense with questions about the John F. Kennedy Assassination,a tragic event that changed America in 1963. The beauty of JFK is that Kennedy's death is seen as an unsolved mystery not about who killed President Kennedy,but why was Kennedy killed,who really benefited,who has the power to cover it up? Was the Kennedy Assassination a conspiracy? Did Lee Harvey Oswald act alone or were there others? Were the United States Federal Government,FBI,CIA and Mob involved? The movie in a frightening way asks these questions but instead of answering them JFK lets viewers answer these questions themselves and the movie messes with you not just physically but mentally as well because the whole entire film is like a giant puzzle or riddle and we as the viewer are trying to put pieces together. JFK is an epic film in the truest sense with a running time of 3 hrs and 9 minutes but it is the fastest three and a half hours you will ever watch and you are never bored or tired. What I love about JFK is the non linear style the film has using flashbacks with some of the characters telling different stories with multiple camera styles to keep the story moving and going nonstop. The screenplay by Zachary Skyler and Oliver Stone is fantastic and powerful with Skyler and Stone giving the movie dialog and scenes that are dramatic and tight and at times feels like a Shakespearean tragedy. The main character Jim Garrison is not only the hero of JFK but he also represents the audience because like Jim Garrison we are investigating why John F. Kennedy was killed and who was behind the assassination and as Garrison goes in deep into the investigation Garrison begins to lose his idealism and the way he used to feel about the law and government before the assassination opening his eyes and realizing white is black and black is white. Although Garrison investigating the case is affecting his personal life with his family,he still loves his family and wants to protect them while still wanting to solve the John F. Kennedy killing never wanting to stop no matter what. Jim Garrison is a fascinating and memorable character and we root for Garrison all the way for wanting to find out the truth. The ending is amazing because even though it is a conclusion It feels like the investigation into John F. Kennedy assassination will go on forever and it will either be solved or remained unsolved with the real truth still being out there. A terrific ending.<br/><br/>The whole cast is amazing. Kevin Costner is excellent and gives the best performance of his career as Jim Garrison,with Costner bringing power,depth and heroic quality to the role. Tommy Lee Jones is terrific as Clay Shaw,a New Orleans business man implicated in the assassination. Gary Oldman is wonderful as Lee Harvey Oswald,the killer and assassin of John F. Kennedy. Joe Pesci is fiery and memorable as David Ferrie,a friend of Clay Shaw's. Kevin Bacon shines as Willie O'Keefe,a male prostitute and friend of David's. Donald Sutherland is fantastic as Mr. X,a former colonial giving Garrison information. Sissy Spacek is great as Liz Garrison,Jim's wife. Jack Lemmon(Jack Martin),Ed Asner(Guy Bannister),Michael Rooker(Bill),Jay O. Sanders(Lou),Laurie Metcalf(Susie),John Candy(Dean Andrews Jr),Walter Matthau(Russell B. Long),Brian Doyle-Murray(Jack Ruby),Wayne Knight(Numa),Beata Pozniak(Marina Oswald),Sally Kirkland(Rose Cheramie)and Vincent D'Onofrio(Bill Newman,eyewitness)give great performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Oliver Stone is brilliant and stylish,with Stone always moving the camera showing close-ups,visual stunning shots that use Black and white to great effect and give the film a documentary feel keep the movie going at a quick pace. Wonderful direction,Stone.<br/><br/>The score by John Williams is outstanding,powerful and intense,with Williams' score being epic,heroic and suspenseful matching the film's tone to perfection. A terrific score by Williams and one of his best.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Oliver Stone,Political Thrillers,Mysteries or films in general,I highly suggest you see JFK,one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent,unforgettable Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"SteveHistory","5","5","20","2 April 2007"," History for the poorly read and the easily duped
","This comment is really TWO comments: One of Oliver Stone's movie itself and a second one on the premise of the film.<br/><br/>First: The film is excellent in telling the story of the various theories surrounding the assassination. Recreated scenes are interwoven with archival film footage so seamlessly that only historical scholars can detect where Dallas ends and Hollywood begins. But for the well read scholar that line is very clear. I enjoy the movie itself. It is a bit long and would bore those without a fairly elaborate background with the details of the assassination and the various plots that have been hatched.<br/><br/>Second: Concerning the historical accuracy of the film. There is none. The only accurate facts are that Kennedy was assassinated, Oswald was shot, and the nation mourned. Everything else is suspect. There is not time here to dissect the film to the degree I would like, besides several websites have already done that much better than I could. The premise of several different gunmen firing up to six or more shots it totally unsubstantiated with ANY credible evidence. The allegations that Kennedy planned to pull out of Vietnam are not accepted by ANY respected historian in the United States. The theory that Oswald and Ruby were involved together is laughable since no evidence exists to support this fanciful theory.<br/><br/>In short, the movie should have been named, ""Dallas in Wonderland"", but Oliver's twist is fun to rip apart."
"jbsalmonnc","6","5","20","30 March 2003"," Oswald did it!
","Oliver Stone may honestly believe Jim Garrison was a great man, but his film (ironically enough) makes him (Garrison) come off as the nut he was.<br/><br/>Conspiracy theories, as we know, rely on belief rather than evidence. People who want to believe the CIA, or Castro, or Lyndon Johnson, or the military, or whoever killed Kennedy will continue to believe, facts be damned.<br/><br/>And the last thing Oliver Stone is interested in is facts."

","Being someone who admired JFK, and as a student of November 22, 1963, I looked forward to this movie with great anticipation. I left the theatre in 1992 with mixed reviews of the movie. Kevin Costner's Cajun accent is very annoying, and I was not impressed with his performance. Some of the scenes are ridiculous, or just plain stupid. There are shots of Costner (as Jim Garrison) sitting at the dinner table, spoon feeding the family dog. Bedroom shots of Costner and Sissy Spacek passionately kissing in bed, then discussing Oswald's marine career.  There is a unnecessary scene with Joe Pecsi, Kevin Bacon and Tommy Lee Jones. They are having gay romp, which absolutely detracts from the movie. There were so many other ideas they could have incorporated. I thought the scenes which dealt with the events in Dealey Plaza were compelling. It showed different views, angles and eyewitness accounts. I felt Oliver Stone was fair in his attempt to give different viewpoints and opinions. It was when the film diverted to events outside of Dealy Plaza that Oliver Stone failed. Since I now own this movie on video, I have the benefit of fast forwarding PAST THE FLUFF to the good stuff. The autposy scenes have a authentic look to them and are compelling to watch. Some of the scenes are shot very fast, and you have to be a historian to know which were the actual photographs from that day, and which were re-shot for the movie. In the final analysis, I believe Oswald acted alone. And I believe this movie could have been alot better if they had not tried to introduce unrelated items into it. Introduce new evidence, yes. Keep Hollywood bedroom scenes for another movie."

","A New Orleans DA becomes obsessed with the Kennedy assassination. Although presented like a documentary, this is nothing more than a propaganda film to advance Stone's paranoid conspiracy theory. It rambles on for an ungodly three and a half hours, and it's pretty much all talk. Most of the film seems like a prologue to the final half hour, where the conspiracy theory is finally presented. Basically, Stone believes that everybody conspired against JFK, including the White House, the Pentagon, the CIA, the FBI, and the Boys Club of America. Costner's character is meant to be sincere and honorable but comes across as pompous. The large all-star cast is impressive."

He is the brains behind films like Platoon, Born On The Fourth Of July, Natural Born Killers, Nixon, Wall Street, and JFK. He seldom fails, and apart from making the dismal Alexander a few years back, Stone is still one of America's most daring and influential filmmakers.<br/><br/>JFK is the best picture Stone has ever made. There's little reason to believe he will ever surpass what he has accomplished for JFK. The film runs for more than three hours, and with the overwhelming amount of content and the humongous scope of the plot, it's unbelievable that Stone managed to complete the production of the film within two years. He expertly explains and explores the conspiracies that surround the assassination of President Kennedy back in the 1960s through spellbinding color and black-and-white images, and the recreation of the chain of sequences that lead to the assassination and its convoluted aftermath.<br/><br/>Was he murdered by the lone shooter Lee Harvey Oswald? Or were there others involved? Did the US military, FBI, CIA conspire to kill their own President? What about the 'magic bullet' theory? Where's the Zapruder film kept? Was there a massive cover-up by the highest authorities of the American government, including its judiciary system? These are all aptly discussed in the film, providing crucial insights, and occasionally leaving more questions unanswered, challenging viewers to think and respond.<br/><br/>Effective individual performances from A-listers like Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, and Donald Sutherland combine flawlessly, resulting in one of the most extensive and well-assembled cast in the history of cinema. JFK won only two Oscars for best cinematography and film editing in a year dominated by Jonathan Demme's Silence Of The Lambs, a meager return for one of the best films of the century. The Academy owes Oliver Stone another best picture and director award.<br/><br/>After critiquing hundreds of films over the last couple of years, JFK still remains rooted in the second spot of my Personal Top 100, only bettered by Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List. It is, in my opinion, the best edited film of all-time. The manner in which Oliver Stone filmed JFK through the use of disturbing flashback images, rapid-fire editing, and intertwining it with suspenseful pulsating rhythms by composer John Williams, and knowing it's all based on a terribly true event makes it one of the most chilling movie experiences ever.

And I have to agree with Roger Ebert's conclusions about this film.  It is not history, but a powerful movie about the emotions of the time, which is just as important as the actual fact that JFK was killed.  Garrison's character is the collective 1960s American who was optimistic about the direction in which the country was being led and when JFK died, that vision vanished as well.  The sense of loss and frustration is what Stone captured to perfection.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised at Costner's performance.

A fantastic crime thriller, with memorable performances by its ensemble cast. Stone manages to recreate the feeling of uncertainty and fear as the world believes in its leaders and where one man questions not only the official response but the very fabric of the power structure of this country. While watching this film one may feel the pressure and tension increasing as was intended by Stone and company. Masterfully scored by legendary composer John Williams adds to the dramatic feeling of lost honor and shadowy intentions that perhaps our countries leaders at the time conveyed. Though historically skewed in certain areas it still reaches and makes its point, that whatever happened in that fateful day and time afterward wasn't as it seemed.

","JFK is one of those films whose impact never diminishes, even after two decades since its initial release. In the wake of the fiftieth anniversary of the assassination, Oliver Stone's claim that the whole event was deliberately engineered by an unholy alliance of the government, the CIA, FBI and other institutions, cannot be readily dismissed. In terms of filmmaking, JFK is cleverly structured as a quest-narrative, with Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) gradually discovering more and more details about the assassination, and the various cover-ups that followed, while being continually frustrated in his task by obstructive institutions and/or individuals. It is a testament to his tenacity that he does not give up. In the final sequence he offers a tour de force in court as he presents his evidence at the trial of Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), whom he suspects of being a CIA agent. We already know the outcome of the trial, but Garrison's case is convincing nonetheless. Director Oliver Stone skillfully blends archive footage, black-and-white re-enactments of important events and color film to create a narrative which, although over two and a half hours in length, never fails to hold our attention. He is helped out by a clutch of excellent performances, notably from Costner (easily his finest hour in the cinema), Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek and - in cameo roles - Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Definitely a film to look at again and again."

","Oliver Stone directed this (still) extremely controversial film that takes the viewpoint of Louisiana District Attorney Jim Garrison(played by Kevin Costner) who believed that U.S. President John F.

He eventually indicts businessman Clay Shaw(played by Tommy Lee Jones) as a co-conspirator, though is unable to obtain a conviction, even as he fears his own life is in danger, and meets with a mysterious ""Mr. X""(played by Donald Sutherland) who knows all about it... Divisive film splits viewer into either believer or skeptic about whether Oswald acted alone or not. Garrison leaves no doubt about his opinion, but regardless, this film is remarkably compelling and brilliantly edited for maximum impact. Over three-hour long director's cut moves at a breathless pace, and film itself is riveting, though viewers who reject conspiracy can't get past the perceived distortions of fact. Stone was saying this film was his answer to the Warren Commission Report, which he regards as myth, though if only he had stayed scrupulously faithful to the facts, there wouldn't be these lingering doubts.

","Let's Examine this for what it is...A Movie, a Film, Entertainment, Pop Culture.<br/><br/>There have been Over 2,000 Books and Hundreds of Documentaries about the Assassination of President Kennedy and the Subject shows no Signs of Disinterest as Witnessed by the 2013, 50 Year Anniversary and its Remembrance.<br/><br/>Given the FACT that there are all those Conspiracy Theories, this is what the Movie is, a Conspiracy Theory Played Out as Drama. It cannot be Faulted that the Film contains these Things. The Conspiracy Theories Exist so they are FACT, so how can it be Derided for Presenting and Reflecting them, for this is part of our Culture. <br/><br/>Also, for those that insist that there was NO CONSPIRACY, and Attack this for being Ridiculous, the Congressional Committee on Assassinations in the Late Seventies Concluded that there was Most Likely a Conspiracy in the Kennedy Murder and the Warren Report was Most Likely in Error on its Conclusion.<br/><br/>This is Fabulous Filmmaking. Oliver Stone is an Artist and a Whiz with the Medium. He Actually Changed the Way Movies are Made. Often Maligned because some of His Films are Overtly Political, that is Beside the Point. He is one Talented Man. The Movie JFK is Brilliant Filmmaking and is a Mesmerizing Experience. An Eye-Popping Extravaganza Filled with Bizarre Touches and Inspirational Intrigue.<br/><br/>Movies are an Expression and this is one Expressionistic Example of the Artform at its Best and is one of the Great Movies. It is an Undeniable and Urgent Understanding that the Blank Screen is there and it is Waiting to be Filled with Visions of the Imagination and Images of the Human Experience. So here We have it."
"Theflyace","8","3","10","22 November 2013"," A Controversial but Technically Brilliant Film from Oliver Stone
","November 22, 1963 was one of the darkest days in American history. It was the day President John F. Kennedy was shot dead riding in his limousine through the city of Dallas, Texas. With today being the 50th anniversary of the assassination, I have decided to review Oliver Stone's controversial film about not only that day in Dallas, but all of the controversy and conspiracy theories that have surrounded it from moment one. <br/><br/>JFK is actually a movie about New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) who takes it upon himself to bring to trial the people he believes conspired to murder the president. He and his staff do not believe that Lee Harvey Oswald (played eerily similar to his historical counterpart by Gary Oldman) simply acted alone, and as it turns out everyone he talks to has a theory about what the really happened, but every time they try to formally question them the ""witnesses to conspiracy"" end up changing their view or end up dead. Garrison does bring a man he believes was directly involved, Clay Shaw (played by Tommy Lee Jones) to trial and tries to prove that it was all a big lie and a conspiracy exists. <br/><br/>The acting is full of very recognizable stars in good roles, even though some are only there ever so briefly that it works against itself, or some historically inaccurate. Costner gives a heroic portrayal of Jim Garrison, whom I think represents Stone's view of the assassination, even though most people know that his real investigation was questionable in his grounds of prosecution, and that he was extremely obsessive about a conspiracy theory. The supporting cast is great and they are great actors, but some completely disappear even though they are all supposed to be involved. <br/><br/>The screenplay, written by Oliver Stone and co-writer Zachary Sklar, is something of which I consider to be a brilliant mystery (something that works unbelievably well even though it really shouldn't) My major problem with the story is that both writers try to cram in way too many conspiracy theories. I myself do not believe most of these theories presented, especially when there is incontrovertible evidence against the theories Stone crams in. For example, modern computer animation by animator Dale Myers, ballistics experts, and even the evidence found in the Book Depository have proved the ""multiple bullet theory"" to be false. However, with these falsehoods in mind, the film does raise some eyebrows about some inconsistencies with the investigation. I hate to say, but some (a very small amount) of these theories could hold water, but we would have to fully research these ideas and think formulate our own opinions. <br/><br/>Like I said at the beginning of the review, this movie has been called one of (some call it the most) controversial films of all time. Many critics and people who were there believe that this movie is very manipulative and completely full of falsehoods and not one shred of truth. I think that people have blindly seen this movie without educating themselves about either the theories or what happened during the actual assassination. Instead of blindly believing everything the movie throws at us, we really have to look into it and study it for ourselves.<br/><br/>But the way the film is executed and filmed is what makes this a classic, and one of the reasons why it appears on my all time favorite films list. The cinematography is so amazing and beautiful that sometimes you question whether or not it's real (another reason why it seems manipulative) Director of Photography Robert Richardson uses the same kind of film stock and cameras that existed in 1963 and before to frame the story in the best way possible. And then there's the editing, which best sums up the feelings of the assassination, which is truly chaotic. The editing is so great in that it forces us to look at all the details and try to keep up with what's going on. Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia did a fantastic job with it and kind of set a standard for kinetic editing that hasn't really been matched in recent years. It also makes sense that both these areas won Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone considers this film to be greatest personal achievement. I, in all honesty, would have to agree with his sentiment. Many think that Stone has tried to manipulate people to match his now ultra-radical views, but he does what a director should be allowed to do. I think what Stone is trying to do is present his anger and confusion about someone who represented the hopes and dreams (his dreams as well) of America being madly gunned down like that, in a way that is more personal and daring than directors and producers were willing to go at that time. Every director should have a view of things and an opinion to present, not to follow the norm or keep quiet.<br/><br/>This film is amazing to watch and is one of those rarities for me in Hollywood, a film to challenge us, make us think, and research about what is presented to us. Some have and will continue to blindly accept what they see in this film and others as fact, which can be dangerous, but still, we have people who are smart enough to know what is true and what is ""Hollywood."" For many people, the movie JFK truly represents the lack of closure and anger we still feel for what happened 50 years ago today."
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","3","3","10","27 January 2012"," Overlong, but not without merit.
","This movie is way too long. I have several problems with Oliver Stone's JFK, but most of them can be boiled down to that simple sentence. I don't have qualms with films that run over 150 minutes, but they have to earn those extensive running times. This one does quite the opposite of that, meandering on needlessly at times and including whole sections that do nothing but fill space and drag the film down.<br/><br/>The whole thing screams for a stronger editor, which is ironic because the individual scenes are edited so well, the flashbacks using precise and dramatic cuts to amp up the intensity. I wish that the dialogue hadn't been so drowned out by the musical score during the flashback sequences, but the precision with the editing in them is truly astonishing. The film as a whole was a mixed bag for me, with moments of brilliance clashing with ones that that were direly inconsequential. Stone's focus on the actual case is remarkable, intense high stake interviews under the powerful and long-lasting themes, but the rest of the film runs so flat.<br/><br/>We follow District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) on his investigation into the murder of John F. Kennedy, but there's also way too much time spent on the pedestrian and dreadfully overbearing home life with his wife, played by Sissy Spacek, and children. Oliver Stone has never been good with creating human characters and the domestic side of this film is perfect proof of that, with gratingly awful and overly theatrical verbal arguments where Spacek hams it up in the worst fashion and Costner is hilariously dull in contrast. It's so awkward watching them work together because they have no chemistry as actors and the relationship is so poorly written.<br/><br/>The other supporting characters, though, are the exact opposite; very well written and impeccably acted by the long list of quality actors in the cast. Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Michael Rooker, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland and the Oscar-nominated Tommy Lee Jones are just a handful of the strong men who deliver phenomenal work here. Though everyone in the supporting ensemble manages to impress, there were two actors who really stood out to me; Gary Oldman and Joe Pesci.<br/><br/>Oldman further cements his chameleon status, using no makeup or changes to his general appearance but being completely unrecognizable under the skin of Lee Harvey Oswald, a performance so intriguing and calculated that I was always desperate to see more of him. The film presents Oswald as an enigma and Oldman, who is seen only through flashbacks, captures the essence of the character perfectly. You can always see the mind running in the eyes of this man, but the audience is never sure what he's actually thinking. We never know where he stands and that's what makes the mystery that much more fascinating. Oldman delivers an Oswald who is as much of an enigma as the assassination itself.<br/><br/>Pesci, on the other hand, is an actor that I have always loathed and was very surprised to find impressive here. I didn't think much of him at first, but there's one scene where he blew me away. His character, a weaselly rat who seems to be trying to play both sides, eventually becomes bogged down on all sides of the war for the truth and is paranoid that at every corner lies his own grim fate. We come to a scene at a motel, which is 5-10 minutes of Pesci just flooring the other characters (and the audience) with his desperation, paranoia and overwhelming fear. It's a devastating and utterly intriguing scene that was able to bring sympathy out of me for a character that I loathed prior to it.<br/><br/>That's a great scene, but ultimately it's extraneous to the film at large, and there are a lot of scenes that fit into that category. It seems like Stone wanted to create a paranoia with all of the great staple scenes, but also wanted to create a film to make the case for the conspiracy theory and decided to just cram them together, and a lot of it comes out feeling like there are two separate films going on. There's a scene where Garrison's character goes to Washington D.C. to meet with the mysterious X, who goes on this tangent of informing Garrison of the dirty deeds of the government. Of course he's an informant so he never names names or gives Garrison anything that he can actually use. It's a brilliantly constructed Deep Throat scene, with high intensity and a great performance from Donald Sutherland as X, but it's about ten minutes along and ultimately adds absolutely nothing to the picture.<br/><br/>Just in watching the film there was at least an hour of footage that I saw that could have easily been cut with no harm to the overall picture. There are some great scenes, but it seems like Stone couldn't decide whether he wanted to make a conspiracy thriller or a film to shove the JFK theory down the throats of the audience. It's unfortunate because there's a lot of potential here, but when we live in a time where there's a film like David Fincher's Zodiac that absolutely perfects what Stone is trying to do here, this one just pales in comparison. I don't think this is a film that is going to make a believer out of anyone who didn't already believe in some form of conspiracy in regards to the JFK assassination and ultimately that's all that it feels like it's trying to do, but there's still a fair amount of quality stuff within it. Just not nearly enough for the running time."
"eddresden","6","5","21","14 March 2005"," Pro's and cons about Stone's films.
","Oliver Stone is undoubtedly a very intelligent man who is very passionate about the chosen subjects he tackles- Vietnam, JFK, Cuba etc. However, with Stone I often do not feel that I am watching a film but more a lecture or some strong political argument/viewpoint.<br/><br/>This is not to say Stone is not making very well made films witch often contain very strong performances but often it is hard not to overlook the grandeur of his films or the stunning shots and focus on the fact that you feel like you're dealing with an activist. <br/><br/>I feel much the same when watching films by Michael Moore (particularly faranheit9/11). As a result one of the feelings I take from Stone's films is a feeling that I am being patronised. Strong and very biased views are being hammered into the viewer from the outset. This is certainly the case in 'JFK' particularly the mesmerising editing in the opening montage scenes which, although brilliant, is clearly biased. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong I generally agree with arguments of Michael Moore and Oliver Stone I just feel that in 'JFK' and in other Stone films such as 'platoon' and 'born on the 4th of july' we are watching more a propaganda pamphlet than a piece of cinema which has balanced views and more open debate towards certain issues."

","This is by far one of the greatest films every made.  Kevin Costner is genius.  Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci are both in the best roles they have ever been in.  Sissy Spacek was spectacular to say the least.  All of the supporting cast (Kevin Bacon, Laurie Metcalf, Gary Oldman, Donald Sutherland) were excellent.  Also, the cameos were very entertaining (Ed Asner, Jack Lemon, Walther Mattheau, John Candy, Jim Garrison(the real man this movie is based on)).  What is arguably even better than the cast is the cinematography and editing(which both took home Oscars).  Also, John Williams score was one of his best, in my opinion.  Altogether, it is nothing short of amazing....."
"diffusionx","10","4","16","16 July 2000"," An Extremely Important Film
","The best thing about ""JFK"" is that, in spite of containing a ton of information, unfolding at a fairly slow pace, and being very long (the director's cut is 206 minutes), it still manages to be amazingly entertaining throughout. I don't know why - it could be because it is such a universal subject for Americans, but it could also be because its such a well-made film. Of course, it's probably a little bit of both.<br/><br/>
The cinematography, editing (Academy Award winners in those categories), direction, pacing, writing, acting, music, everything just weaves together so beautifully in this movie. Everything present within ""JFK"" has meaning, and, thus, its entertaining to watch the entire thing, because you see and hear new things with just about every shot. It all builds up to the last courtroom scene, which is one of the finest bits of movie making I've ever seen. Ultimately, this final scene shows how important the movie is: Oliver Stone is trying to say that Kennedy's assassination (and subsequent cover-up) meant a lot more than the President's death. He also handled these parts so well that it didn't sound preachy or heavy-handed, it just sounds like the genuine truth.<br/><br/>Put simply, this is an exhilarating movie. It's also a film that could make a person think about things they probably didn't spend much time on before. For that reason, ""JFK"" is highly recommended."
"kayobee","9","4","16","19 January 2004"," Logically and historically ludicrous ... and damn compelling
","My review for what it's worth....<br/><br/>I wish I could explain my attraction to this film. I'm not an Oliver Stone fan and I avoid Kevin Costner. I'm no conspiracy buff, but even if I were, I believe the one rather shakily outlined here would still be too absurd for me: it seems to be an agglomeration of most of the various conspiracy theories associated with the assassination of JFK, finished off with some shiny new rococo bits dug from Stone's subconscious, and all of it pretty much requiring the participation or knowledge of something like 30% of the western hemisphere. I'm frankly annoyed by Stone's portrayal of Kennedy as revolutionary cut down before he could perform the great acts he was destined for -- Kennedy was a shallow, self-serving little fellow who had few scruples and way too many issues.<br/><br/>As if all that weren't enough, I don't like its portrayal of gay men, it has what must be filmdom's longest monologue, and at something like 3 hours, it's way over my usual tolerance.<br/><br/>So I should hate it, yes? But somehow, despite all of the above, the damn film **works**.<br/><br/>The acting is tremendous (Donald Sutherland plus Kevin Bacon *plus* Joe Pesci PLUS Tommy Lee Jones ... need I go on?). Even Costner, who normally leaves me lukewarm, is great. Intentionally or not, there's a perfect creepy undercurrent to his ""hero's"" obsessive pursuit (somehow quietly emphasized by those damn upright, uptight hornrimmed glasses of his).<br/><br/>Yes, the plot is ludicrous, but Stone's passionate insistence that *something* was going on leaks through every frame, compelling the viewer to follow the plot's leaps and twists with the drugged sense of inevitability usually experience in dream logic.<br/><br/>That monologue? Done by an actor I don't care for, expounding a theory I don't buy -- and I was flipping spellbound. The film is just... excellent. Annoyingly excellent, because it's just damn wrong -- but excellent cinema, anyway."

"cawriter-1","3","4","17","14 June 2011"," conspiracy theorists have no case
","This film states emphatically that JFK was killed by a conspiracy, but could this be demonstrated in court? Remember, the murder of JFK was a crime. We settle criminal matters in court. Did the Warren Commission give us a substantial criminal case? Yes. We have: a suspect (Lee Harvey Oswald); his gun, shells and fingerprints; ballistics tests; autopsy evidence; witnesses who heard shots from the Depository and saw a gunman who looked like Oswald in the window; Oswald's presence at the scene of the crime; the long thin paper- wrapped package he brought to work that day; several reenactments that proved someone with Oswald's military training could have committed the crime, and that one bullet could have wounded both JFK and Gov. Connally; Oswald's actions after the murder (he fled the scene, went home, got his handgun, shot and killed a Dallas police officer); etc. Can this evidence be questioned? Of course! Certainly, Oswald's attorney would have done so in court. But the fact remains that a solid criminal case exists against Oswald. Every day, people are convicted on less evidence (I know; I have served on criminal-case juries three times). By contrast, conspiracy theorists have no suspect, no gun, no shells or fingerprints or ballistics evidence or a paper or money trail -- they have no case that could be presented in court. To the argument ""We could present a case, but the evidence we need is locked up,"" I reply: how do you know what this locked-up evidence says? What would you tell a judge: we know someone other than Oswald killed JFK, but we can't name the killer or present any actual evidence? The judge would throw you out of court, as the real-life jury did with the real-life Jim Garrison. This film, which is reasonably well done as a movie, is nothing more than fantasy entertainment. Please don't think it gives us some actual truth."
"tushky111185","10","4","17","6 February 2009"," One of the Best Political Dramas Ever
","One of the things that I truly appreciate about the film is the boldness with which the director has gone ahead & depicted what he wanted to. After all, the film hints at Kennedy's assassination being carried out by orders from the highest level of bureaucracy. I can imagine the kind of controversy the film would have been subject to after its release.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, a New Orleans District Attorney who is convinced that there is a big conspiracy around President Kennedy's assassination. He along with his team start gathering evidence to prove it. In their quest for reality, they come across several startling facts about the American Defense Establishment & the political backing that it gets. Things get heady when, Garrison's investigation is out in the media. Those involved in the conspiracy try & tarnish Garrison's reputation so that his investigation loses credibility. Not to be bogged down by his detractors, Garrison works day in & day out to prepare a strong case to prove conspiracy. The climax is marked by a riveting courtroom drama where Garrison convinces everybody that there was indeed a conspiracy to assassin President Kennedy.<br/><br/>Now, the thing that I like the most about this film is that none of the characters have concealed identity. Everything is out in the open. Right from Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) being gay to David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) being involved in the Cuban War.Perhaps the most riveting scene in the film is that involving a former general & Garrison where the general gives him the insight that rather than 'who' assassinated the President, it is much more important to know 'why' he was assassinated.<br/><br/>Costner carries out his role with panache & is truly at his best when he arouses emotions in the climax. Joe Pesci is quiet convincing & kudos to Tommy Lee Jones for carrying off the controversial role with such audacity.<br/><br/>Its a 10/10 & a must watch for all those who like political dramas despite its 3 hours running length."
"yddsp@aol.com","10","4","17","25 January 2008"," Unbelievable!!
","What a sad commentary on the world in which we live, that such a progressive, highly public figure and advocate for peace and racial harmony, is cut down in the prime of his life. Just another example of the flagrant travesty of justice and morality. I was but a youngster on the day of President Kennedy's assassination, but it is still a very raw, horrendously sad subject in my mind, even to this date. The fact that President Kennedy had personally known the horrors associated with war and vowed to avoid it at all costs, only exacerbates the heinous act itself and substantiates the need for the full disclosure of facts and further investigation into the possibility of some clandestine conspiracy and treasonable act. That such an egregious, cowardly act could have been perpetrated on this progressive human rights advocate, great man and political figure, only makes one shudder in disbelief. Just as the age-old saying predicts in the trenches: ""There are no atheists in foxholes"", Mr. Kennedy knew, firsthand, that the color of someone's skin is of no importance, especially when life and liberty are on the line and that the mere concept of war is, plain and simple, an aberration.<br/><br/>It further staggers the imagination that there could be even the possibility of some government cover-up against releasing the files associated with that tragic event and day. Just the notion of a conspiracy sends cold chills down one's spine, as it is an indictment on the most basic of moral values and democracy itself. To blatantly discard or detract from the intrinsic value found in the physical evidence of this case, reeks of a conspiracy in its own right. We all know that war is the biggest business of all where the rich only get richer and the good inevitably die young. Somehow I'm a bit surprised that a filmmaker was able to address this issue with relative impunity for broaching a subject of such delicate and potentially incriminating nature, although perhaps enough time has passed in history to relegate this event to the rhetorical or even dismiss it as simply artistic hyperbole and superficial speculation for the sake of the entertainment value alone. Unless, that is, the powers of corruption and darkness continue to run so deep as to infest and permeate the entire fabric of both the political and judicial machines. In any event, this film definitely strikes a chord of suspicion and is fodder for a complete and final investigation, if for nothing else, for history's sake. I salute Mr. Stone for this excellent dramatic achievement. It most certainly begs the question of just how safe are we from ourselves and if ""Big Brother"" could be a festering, insidious reality or a portent of things yet to come? Julius Caesar must be turning in his grave. Excellent film!!"

","JFK, the movie, is cleverly made by Oliver Stone. With so many possible people, groups and or government agencies/ officials who wanted Kennedy dead, no wonder he was killed. With that in mind, it is nothing close to a miracle that this movie holds up right until the end. In all fairness, making a movie with such a difficult plot could (or maybe should) have resulted in a bomb. Instead it delivers a knock out punch. Costner does well as Jim Garrison the public prosecutor who goes after the real killers of JFK. All other characters, even the over the top ones, are perfectly in line with Costerners performance.<br/><br/>Anything related to JFK sparks controversy and this movie heats up the debate like no other. Whether you feel comfortable with the official story or with the dozen alternative theories does not really matter to still enjoy a magical performance by all artists involved, in front and behind the camera, in making this movie. Highly recommended, Zapruder film shows graphical violence and foul language is used throughout the movie."
"dkw001","4","4","17","14 December 2006"," Disappointing...but not for the reasons everyone says it is
","Contrary to popular opinion, the problem with Oliver Stone's lengthy tale of the most controversial assassination of the 20th century isn't the fact that he says ""everyone did it"". Frankly, I wouldn't have cared if he implicated Canada, Orochi cultists, or space aliens...*because that's what the story of the assassination is about.* Suspicion. Uncertainty. Paranoia. The idea that it really could've been anyone, anywhere. The powerful, overwhelming belief in a conspiracy, and, just as important, why so many people *wanted* to believe. This would've been a great movie, probably one of the pivotal films of our time, if Stone did nothing more than explore this angle and give ideas...not facts, just ideas...on what the potential conspirators' motives would've been. Why would organized crime put a hit on him? Would Cuba dare perform an act of war on American soil? How could a sitting vice president possibly pull this off and not get caught?<br/><br/>Instead, Stone committed a cardinal sin...he let his ego get in the way. He was thoroughly convinced that there was ONE possibility and constructs the entire movie around it, effectively rendering about the first 80% of the movie meaningless. And I really didn't like how the protagonist lawyer quickly became the sole focus in a movie that all but begs for multiple voices and perspectives. The trial of Clay Bertram was such a reach that it was virtually anticlimactic (and I considered this the most interesting part of the movie), and the final verdict will come as no surprise at all.<br/><br/>I want a ballsy antihero, I'll watch an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. JFK should've been *about* JFK. That it wasn't was what where it came up unforgivably short."

The story itself and the message I believe would have been more effective with less hysterical cutting and flash backs which detracted immensely from any sense of reality and continuity. I know the effect aimed at was in part the insanity of those involved in this sad chapter of American history, but making the narrative so shapeless is not the best way to achieve historical reconstruction by aesthetic means.

"DrEbert","8","4","17","22 July 2005"," Truly fascinating and brilliant film-making
","I had never given much thought to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. I am not nor ever have been any kind of conspiracy theorist, though that's not to say that I'm not a skeptic either. I was skeptical of the ""official story"" in the assassination. I suspected there was some kind of conspiracy involved and that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, but never gave the matter much thought nor did I ever actually go back and look at any of the evidence in the matter.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone is different, though. For him, the world shook when shots rang out in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, and left the youthful, handsome, and charismatic President of the United States dead, the Governor of Texas severely wounded, and the nation in shock. The Warren Commission's official story of what happened that day really bothered Stone. It was a story he found hurried, inadequate, flawed, and highly suspect, like the Commission was desperate to make the facts fit a preconceived notion of one assassin and three shots. It bothered him enough that he made a movie offering, in his words, ""my counter-fiction to the Warren Commission's fiction."" ""JFK"" isn't supposed to be the definitive end-all explanation of what happened that fateful day but rather is supposed to get us thinking about it again, a task that it achieves with sheer brilliance.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone presents us with a unique set of characters: the straight-faced New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), the flamboyant low-life David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), a loudmouth male prostitute (Kevin Bacon), the snobbish businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), the ""Deep Throat""-like mystery informant known only as X (Donald Sutherland), and the mysterious Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman). Except for Bacon and Sutherland's characters, who are composite figures, all the others are based on real people. What Stone is doing, though, is not retelling the story of how Jim Garrison brought forth the only prosecution in the JFK assassination. Even while this movie was in production, Stone was being criticized for making a movie for the purpose of ""vindicating"" the real-life Garrison, who many see as being interested only in his own glory. Stone, however, is not trying to vindicate anybody here. What Stone has done is use the real-life story of Jim Garrison as a jumping-off point to present his case, which is why Stone makes use of information (such as the whereabouts of Oswald right before the assassination) that Garrison did not have in 1969. Stone wants to cast suspicion on the Warren Commission's findings and uses Garrison as his medium to do just that.<br/><br/>In that sense, this movie is not really advocating any one theory but rather rejecting the Warren Commission's theory. People have criticized the final theory that Stone puts forth, but in doing so, they have achieved his goal, which is to get the dialogue going again on the JFK assassination. What he presents is not necessarily fact but is rather ""counter-fiction."" The first half of the film feels very much like a conspiracy theory, where I sat wondering how much of what I was being shown was true. In the scene where Garrison meets with X, where X talks about the question of *why* Kennedy was killed, the reasons put forth bring the conspiracy to the highest levels of the government and somehow manage to sound both outrageous and plausible at the same time. Throughout the movie, Stone uses a variety of film types and both color and black-and-white to present flashbacks and hypothetical scenarios so realistic that they achieve their goal of feeling like they are actual events.<br/><br/>The end result is a movie that offers not *the* answer but *an* answer, an answer that rejects the Warren Commission's theory of a lone assassin, with evidence to support it. Now, tons of movies have been made and tons of books have been written offering various answers. But what makes Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" so unique is its storytelling. ""JFK"" is thrilling and mysterious, grabbing us by the collar and leading us step-by-step through the eyes of Jim Garrison through one of the greatest unsolved crimes of the 20th century. At the climax, Stone uses the power of film to its fullest potential, using his own color and black-and-white footage, created with a variety of film types, alongside archived footage (especially the famous Zapruder film) to show his heart-pounding recreation of the assassination, with John William's exhilarating soundtrack playing in the background. It is quite simply one of the the most exciting and heart-pounding scenes I have ever seen in any movie. ""JFK"" won Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing and this one scene was enough to win both of those awards. It is a scene that is undoubtedly used in film schools to demonstrate a masterpiece of cinematography and editing.<br/><br/>After watching ""JFK,"" I still can't say that I know what happened at Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. Did Oswald act alone? Was there a conspiracy? If so, who was involved? How many shots rang out? Was Oswald merely, as he claimed, a ""patsy""? ""JFK"" asks these questions and wants us to ask them. It wants us to, if not reject, then at least *question* the official account and after watching it, it's impossible not to."

"telegonus","10","4","18","11 April 2001"," Film Noir On a Grand Scale
","Oliver Stone's interpretation of the Kennedy assassination can be found in his film JFK, a remarkable, energetic movie that may be, from a purely intellectual standpoint, total nonsense, but this in no way diminishes its stature as a film. Perhaps the best way to deal with Oliver Stone is to see him as a mad artist type. History of full of such men,--Edgar Allan Poe, Wagner, Van Gogh, Jackson Pollock, Ezra Pound--and there's no reason why the movies can't have their fair share of them as well. Once one accepts Stone as insane his vision becomes acceptable, brilliant, even comforting in a way. If we can accept Wagner seeing Jews conspiring to destroy art, why can't we accept Stone finding the CIA, with or without the help of the Mafia and the FBI, undermining the inegrity of the Republic at every turn? Wagner saw his Ring cycle as among others things a political statement. We see it as a work of art. Wagner thought of himself as a philosopher and a critic, while we see him as a composer. Stone views himself as a man with a mission. With the help of his idol, Jim Garrison, he wants to set the record straight on who was really responsible for the death of President Kennedy. Those who criticize the film JFK on the grounds that Stone has played fast and loose with the truth or that Garrison was a showman have I believe missed the beauty of this astonishing and intricately woven film, which is simply magnificent, epic in scope, committed to ideals (whether one agrees with the film on the particulars is another matter) and a shining example of the best that can be done in movies in our time. The problem with Oliver Stone is that while his sensibility is purely aesthetic, his intellect tends to drift in a political, New Leftist and paranoid direction. In this respect JFK is two movies, the poltical movie everyone argues about, and the aesthetic movie that everyone enjoys and then gets angry with himself for having liked so much, which then in turn leads to more controversy, which never seems to end. My praise is for the aesthetic JFK, the great and moving story of the death of a president and of the various controversies surrounding the circumstances of his death and those who may or may not be responsible for it. The issue of whether Oswald acted alone, had accomplices, or was merely a patsy, has yet to be resolved. JFK is something to be experienced, not debated. The acting is something to see. It's as if the various stars who appear in the film, often in nearly cameo roles, felt priveleged to be asked to be in this movie at all. As a result John Candy, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland and Walter Matthau are as good as they've ever been. In a larger role, Gary Oldman is so believable as Lee Oswald it's almost frightening. Joe Pesci is hilarious, pathetic and surprisingly convincing as David Ferrie. Tommy Lee Jones is a campy Clay Shaw, and while he is decent in the role I wish he had toned down his somewhat supercilious irony. Kevin Costner at first seems a little too simple to be Jim Garrison, but he emphasizes the heroic rather than analytical side of the man, and this is after all a movie. There's a Gary Cooper little boy lost quality to Costner that works well here, and his obvious fondness for the role and his ease in playing it is in the end a winning quality. Music is well-utilized throughout the film, as is Stone's fondness for offbeat camera angles and an editing style that seems designed to maximize the viewer's sense of dread. Essentially JFK is film noir, done in a contemporary style, on the grandest scale imaginable. It's enough to make Fritz Lang applaud from the grave."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","12","21 November 2013"," No Matter What You Believe About the Conspiracy, a Brilliantly Made Film
","JFK (1991) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Is there really a need to go into the plot? Oliver Stone's film still manages to stir up all sorts of controversy. I first saw this movie when I was just eleven and I still remember every single minute that my friends and I had inside that theater. I had never quite seen anything like this movie and even though Stone would use this style in future films (like NATURAL BORN KILLERS) there's still no question that he created something quite powerful here. I really don't care what side of the decade you're on, this film will at least get some sort of emotion out of you.<br/><br/>Watching the film again on its theatrical re-released, I must admit that it has held up quite well and it's pretty amazing that Stone is able to take this rather confusing story without countless plots and characters and maintain your focus throughout its long running time and make it to where you can understand everything going on. In a recent interview Stone said having such an all-star cast helped the film so much because you know the actors so you can believe what they're telling you or what Stone is trying to sell. This is certainly true because it's rather amazing how many terrific actors are in this thing and its even more special today considering how many of them are no longer with us. The cast is without question exceptional and this is especially true for Kevin Costner who turns in a terrific performance as Jim Garrison, the New Orleans D.A. who decides to bring up charges in the Kennedy assassination. Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci are especially memorable in their roles as are Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, John Candy and Sissy Spacek. Michael Rooker is another one who stands out and how about that long speech that Donald Sutherland must give? Then you have vets like Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. Flawless casting all around.<br/><br/>The screenplay obviously wants to sell its opinion that there were many conspiracies around the Kennedy assassination. I can't say I believe everything that's being sold here but it does make for an interesting jumping off point in regards to debating what really happened. The way Stone uses black and white footage for the flashbacks was quite terrific and then you have the brilliant score from John Williams that really hammers home the best moments of the film. The final act takes place inside the courtroom and these moments are among the most chilling that you're ever going to see. This is also where the editing is so important as Costner's character tries to sell the conspiracy theory. I know its impossible to bring this movie up without all sorts of controversy but I've never thought that was a bad thing as long as it could lead to an interesting debate. There's no question that Stone had a mission with this movie and he completely succeeded with one of the best of the decade."
"michaeldouglas1","3","4","19","22 October 2008"," Slick movie-making, but utterly false history.
","I rated ""JFK"" a ""3"" because it is technically an engrossing, suspenseful, well put-together piece of film-making. Terrific recreations (especially Dealey Plaza), excellent acting, great music score. Builds incredible tension, which is an especially difficult undertaking in a movie about a well-known and highly publicized historical event (and one that everyone knows the outcome of). I have to give Oliver Stone credit as a movie-maker. And I guarantee you won't fall asleep watching ""JFK"". That's the good news.<br/><br/>The bad news is -- ""JFK"" is completely biased and fictional as a piece of history. Period. It presents the JFK killing as certain conspiracy buffs (whom Oliver Stone used as technical advisors) would LIKE us to believe happened, in order to sell more of their books. As a movie that purports to be a ""documentary"" on the subject, ""JFK"" is abysmal and wouldn't even rate a ""1"".<br/><br/>Essentially what Oliver Stone does is take EVERY conspiracy theory ever put forward since the assassination itself, and thrown it into his plot. The average movie-goer, unacquainted with all the ""in's and out's"" of the JFK assassination, won't know this and will tend to take everything Stone says as gospel. I myself didn't know much about the Kennedy killing when I first saw this movie in the theaters. Stone seemingly presents a mountain of ""evidence"" to prove his thesis, and to the uninitiated it's all rather compelling. <br/><br/>However, after taking the time to read several books on the subject, I realized just how much a piece of fiction Stone's screenplay really is. I was amazed that some of the ""conspiracy"" proof that Stone uses has been so long and so effectively refuted that even the most dedicated buffs don't hold with them anymore! Stone throws much junk ""evidence"" into the mix that, in some cases, hasn't been taken seriously by ANYONE in almost 30 years.<br/><br/>Even more disturbing is Stone's need to create, out of whole-cloth, certain sub-plots, scenes, and characters that never existed! Kevin Bacon's ""Willie O'Keefe"" immediately comes to mind -- there was no such person, nor anyone even remotely resembling him in real-life. Donald Sutherland's ""Colonel X"" is only vaguely based on a nut-case ex-officer named Prouty who liked to make himself big by claiming ""special knowledge"" of the assassination. And yet most of what comes out of ""Colonel X's"" mouth can't even be attributed to Prouty -- just the fertile mind of Oliver Stone! Stone created numerous scenes to suit his plot -- including virtually every scene with Joe Pesci's character, and many with Tommy Lee Jones' ""Clay Shaw"" character. No basis for any of it -- just made for a more compelling storyline. Same with many of Lee Harvey Oswald's scenes (chillingly performed by Gary Oldman, by the way). All this, while adding to the entertainment factor of ""JFK"", does nothing to bolster it's authenticity. Stone of course defended such make-believe with the time-honored claim of ""artistic license"". Yes, Hollywood has taken many liberties over the years with real events and people -- but Oliver Stone takes this to an ENTIRELY new level.<br/><br/>While Kevin Costner may be a compelling actor, Stone's idea of making his character, real-life New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison, a ""folk hero"" is absurd to the point of being laughable. Jim Garrison was a corrupt, despicable character who routinely abused the power of his office to promote himself in a way that makes D.A. Mike Nyfong of the Duke ""rape"" case look like a saint by comparison! Again, Stone counts on the public not knowing the incredibly shady aspects of Garrison's ""investigation"" (if you can even call it that), and his witch-hunt against a man he knew, long before the trial even began, to be innocent.<br/><br/>The other ""hero"" of Oliver Stone's piece is, not surprisingly, Lee Harvey Oswald himself. Stone not only clears Oswald of ever being a ""real"" Communist, but also absolves Oswald of any responsibility in the killing, and THEN starts presenting the idea that he actually tried to warn the FBI of the plot, but was ignored because the FBI (among many, many organizations) was in on it. In fact, it's hard to find anyone OTHER than Oswald who Stone believes WASN'T in on the plot or the subsequent cover-up. VP Lyndon Johnson, the CIA, the FBI, the Secret Service, military intelligence, the Mafia, the Anti-Castro Cubans, the Dallas Police Dept, Jack Ruby, the Warren Commission...in Oliver Stone's twisted fantasy-world, they're ALL in on it!<br/><br/>And Stone's ""ultimate truth"" -- that Kennedy was assassinated cause he wanted to pull out of Vietnam -- simply isn't backed-up by any facts. It was JFK who increased our military commitment in Vietnam by three-fold, to over 18,000 troops, by 1963. Stone would have us believe that JFK suddenly had a ""change of heart"" and wanted, but never got around to, pulling out of Vietnam. That JFK, already sensitive to the charge of being ""soft on Communism"", would do this with re-election looming in 1964 is EXTREMELY improbable. Stone's citation of a particular ""National Security Action Memo"" JFK signed as the first step in the pull-out is, like so much else in ""JFK"", a complete fabrication.<br/><br/>It would take far too many pages to refute every factual error Stone makes in his movie; suffice to say that the over-all effect is stupifying. If one wants to really get the ""low down"" on the Kennedy killing, I would suggest Gerald Posner's monumental work ""Case Closed"". Posner, who for years was a leading conspiracy theorist himself, finally ""saw the light"" and is now dedicated to debunking such fantasies. He succeeds in ""blowing out of the water"" EVERY piece of ""evidence"" Stone presents, and gives a compelling picture of the REAL Jim Garrison, who's about as far from Kevin Costner's heroic portrayal as you can get. ""JFK"" is slick entertainment, but forget it as a factual account of a historic event."

The music and editing tried to make it more interesting, but it didn't do much. Performances are decent, with Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Costner, and Joe Pesci.<br/><br/>Story basically goes into the Jim Garrison investigation behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy, showing his interviews, deep readings, and attempts to serve justice. Looks into a lot of info flashback style, but I think they try to hard to inform us. Most of the dialogue is obvious facts going deeper into hardcore facts that most of us don't care about. I feel like i'm reading a book instead of watching a movie.<br/><br/>One major problem is Stone's inconsistency with the truth. There was one shooter, not three. Stone changed it around just to make it more interesting. Also, some characters are falsely portrayed. Garrison in real life was rotten, corrupt, and unfair, while he's portrayed in the film as a fair and reasonable working man and loving father. Not Costner's fault really, just the script. I just couldn't get into it, they were shoving the history books into my brain. If you want a 3 hour false history lesson, then here ya go."
"lee_eisenberg","10","4","20","31 July 2005"," the conspiracy continues unraveling
","Some people contend that Oliver Stone's movie ""suggested"" that the government was behind the Kennedy assassination, but I wish to assert that it proved that the government was behind it, as were the Mafia and the Cuban exiles. Kevin Costner plays New Orleans DA Jim Garrison, who sought to expose the conspiracy: the generals were angry at Kennedy for trying to get out of Vietnam, the Cuban exiles blamed JFK for being ""soft"" on Castro (which he really wasn't), and after the assassination, everyone who should have investigated was sent out of the country.<br/><br/>There's another interesting part here. Recently, Cuban exile Luis Posada Carriles was arrested for illegally entering the United States. A cop during Batista's reign, he fled to the US and was trained at Ft. Benning, Georgia. In 1976, he blew up the airplane carrying Cuba's LaCrosse team, killing everyone on board. He never repented. In 1997, he set off several bombs in Havana hotels, killing an Italian tourist, and then in 2000 was arrested after he tried to assassinate Castro while the Cuban leader was making a speech in Panama. Acquitted by Panama's outgoing president in 2004, he made his way to the US. Now that he's been arrested, reports have been coming out about him. One was titled ""Who has what to hide about Luis Posada Carriles?"" It says that he may have been in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963, and that George H.W. Bush may have also been there.<br/><br/>I don't know for certain that Posada was there, but it begs the question: if more information about the Kennedy assassination comes out, what are we going to learn about whom? Now that most Americans believe that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, what else is out there? Even the ""official"" story about Oswald is sketchy. He supposedly defected to the Soviet Union, but he'd never had any pro-Communist sympathies during his youth. Apparently, around the time when he ""defected"", U2 spy planes began flying missions over the USSR. One was shot down on May Day, 1960, forcing a cancellation of a summit between Eisenhower and Khrushchev. According to what I've read, it sounds like the CIA deliberately sent the plane over there in order to cripple possibilities that Cold War tensions would ease. But just how does this relate to Oswald and the assassination? Who all was involved? As it is, it sounds like some Nazis were also involved.<br/><br/>I feel that I should also discuss John Kennedy himself. He has been known as progressive, but if one looks at his record, one becomes cynical. He made a conscious effort to overthrow Castro, even approving Operation Mongoose to destabilize Cuba. He increased the number of US troops in South Vietnam. Known as involved in the Civil Rights Movement, in reality he tried to stop the March on Washington, and even sent LBJ to Norway that day, believing him to be ""too pro-civil rights"" (which Johnson wasn't). Probably most perfidious of all, when a pro-democracy movement arose in Guatemala against the terrorist regime installed by the CIA, Kennedy made sure to crush the movement. So why did certain elements want to eliminate him? Because he wasn't an extremist. He didn't want to use US troops to invade Cuba (and so the CIA embarrassed him into taking the blame for the Bay of Pigs debacle), and he was planning to remove US troops from Vietnam by 1965. This is why they decided to get rid of him. It seems that the same sentiments existed in the Soviet bureaucracy: less than a year after the Kennedy assassination, Soviet hardliners overthrew Khrushchev, probably the most moderate Soviet leader until Gorbachev.<br/><br/>If we continue investigating this, who knows what we'll discover. But the overall point is that ""JFK"" proved (not implied) that there was a conspiracy."
"zetes","8","3","14","29 May 2006"," Mostly great, with a few bad sequences that significantly harm the film
","I'm not especially familiar with all aspects of the Kennedy assassination (it was well before my time), but one thing's for sure: the Warren Commission's final word is more than a little incredible. I don't know how much of Oliver Stone's film is provable fact, how much of it is loony conjecture, or how much he just plain made up (he says none, but others have denied that). What I do know is that the film, even though it runs at 3 and a half hours, is engaging, exciting, gripping and suspenseful. I'm not a big fan of movies that follow investigations, but it's great here. And I especially hate courtroom dramas, but the final sequences of the movie represent an extremely tight tour-de-force. The film is at its best when it's exploring the mystery, and, confoundingly, at its very worst when it takes time to develop its characters. There are two scenes particularly when Jim Garrison's wife (played by Sissy Spacek at her very worst) accosts him for not spending enough time with his family. I'm thinking, ""HELLO! Most important investigation in American history going on here!"" I think his kids would forgive him in the future for being a bit inattentive at the time. The second of these scenes, where Costner explains to his kids that he won't be leaving their mommy, almost had me throwing stuff at the screen it was so sappy. Kevin Costner isn't very interesting, and, besides, from what I've read Stone really softened the character of Jim Garrison, so any character development on that front is dishonest. Most of the best acting comes from the massive supporting cast, where almost anybody is liable to show up. I was quite happy when John Larroquette showed up, and even happier when Donald Sutherland appeared. And Brian Doyle Murray as Jack Ruby? Awesome. My favorite performance by far was Kevin Bacon. I always feel bad for the guy, because he's spent such a long career acting in middling roles. He really is a fine actor, which he gets to prove every so often. He only has five or six minutes in this film, but he's great."

","I'm not an Oliver Stone fan, but ""JFK"" is riveting, from start to finish. I agree with movie critic Leonard Maltin that this movie is not to be taken as documentary. It does, however, back up the public's doubts about the conclusions of the Warren Report. The cast is excellent (Kevin Costner did Garrison a few favors in temperament). It's only been a decade since this movie was made, but they just don't make 'em like this anymore."
"sychonic","Null","3","14","19 June 2000"," As fact, this movie is a disaster, as fiction, it's mediocre.
","When this movie first came out, I was very skeptical--Oliver Stone has a penchant for making absurd movies with extreme messages and hit or miss stylization. ""Born on the Fourth"" of July"" was utter garbage and ""Salvador"" was ugly when it wasn't being patently ridiculous. I ended up not seeing JFK because of the reviews. I'd gotten enough info on it to realize that it was going to be something from Oliver Stone's vivid fantasy life and I wanted no part of that. Since that time Olive Stone has become something of a laughing stock and subject of ridicule when it comes to his silly conspiracy theories. So, when JFK came on cable the other day, I decided to see what it was all about. <br/><br/>If you take the basic premise as fiction, which it clearly is, the core of the movie becomes pretty interesting: A secret cabal of anti-communists in the Federal government wants to involve the U.S. in Vietnam and feel JFK is weak, since he was so lacking in resolve during the Bay of Pigs. In fact it's somewhat similar to ""Seven Days in May"" in that respect. Taken as a basic fictional political thriller, the movie is still pretty mediocre--Jim Garrison's character is not sympathetic at all--he's self righteous and condescending, and why he's doing any of this as a New Orleans District Attorney is somewhat mystifying. The real flaw is that it's bloated and ponderous, it's complexity is mostly a plus, but it gets boring after a while. <br/><br/>But even fictional movies must hang together. The movie never really deals with the fact that it was JFK who put the first combat troops into Vietnam and was busy escalating the conflict when he was assassinated--not trying to extract us as the movie represents. In addition, the whole ""back and to the left"" concept is iffy--bullets usually go in to a person causing a small hole and exit causing a big hole. The Garrison character posited the last bullet came from the front, whereas the Zapruder film shown in the movie showed a bullet exiting Kennedy's head in the front. <br/><br/>Still, minor points aside, if you watch this movie looking for history--you're bound to be disappointed, there's too much outright fiction intermingled with the legitimate questions raised. For those who think a conspiracy was involved in the assassination this doesn't provide an explanation that hangs together."

","This entire movie is a preposterous lie from start to finish. It's based upon the lunatic fantasies of a New Orelans district attorney and Stone's final conclusions made me laugh out loud in the theater. It's all just so incredibly silly except when you realize that most Americans believe in one stupid conspiracy theory or another regarding the death of JFK. Read the Warren Report. or better yet, read Vincent Bugliosi's definitive book on the subject and stop making a fool of yourself by parroting the lies found in this ridiculous excuse for a drama. The worst thing about this movie is how he presents it almost as if it were a documentary when, in fact, it has little bearing on the truth. Stone should be ashamed of himself."

"FScottFitzhemingway","8","3","15","11 February 2011"," Great film making, built on lies.
","JFK is a great movie with a great cast and Oliver Stone is a first rate film maker, a master. This movie is a story built on shameful lies playing on the viewers emotions of a fallen president with a masters skill of the art. When confronted about his lies and proved deceptions, Mr. Stone was called out rightfully so and he ended up finally calling his movie JFK a ""Counter Myth"" to the government lies about the assassination. <br/><br/>That's healthy, informative and constructive? Building on his (Stone) perceptions of lies to this American event that still brings hard felt emotions to most who remember and still feel its impact, is a travesty Stone did not share his doubts only, but created a 3rd dimension that never happened, and never did. I call it a slap in the face to the viewer and shameful to many viewers to come, that know nothing of the Kennedy assassination and now see JFK as FACT 101. <br/><br/>This movie has become the world's ""general understand"" of what happened in Dallas 1963, and the events before and after. Its a travesty for that simple reason. It is clear to me Mr. Stone has a real love and devotion for Pres. Kennedy's memory, as do I and many around the world, but it's clear viewing his 3 hour lie that he believes the myth, and so should his viewers. A good movie director does not is make a good historian. Artistic License may work with movies like Amadeus or Lawrence of Arabia and a lot of others, but calling out close to everyone in our government and their mother's in the murder of Jack Kennedy is a travesty . Hey Oliver, Jack would not be impressed, only saddened by your efforts."

"SavingPrivateSam-ltq","10","3","15","14 July 2008"," A movie about the pursuit of the truth.
","I had always hated this movie for pointing out the bad things about the US government in order to get public appearances. I don't like movies like that. Making a good movie, you need to have good acting, good directing and a good plot. Having a controversial topic doesn't make you anything special. However, since everybody was praising this movie, I decided to give it a try. But, I have to admit and I slept during watching it for its.<br/><br/>On another lovely morning, I got up at 5:00 a.m. in the morning, everything was still dark, I couldn't see anything. Since I already got up, I had no intention of falling asleep again, and I didn't know how to cook then. Inn order to kill my time, I took out the DVD of Jfk and inserted it into the DVD player. When I finished watching it, it was already eight o'clock in the morning, and sun had already come out. I sat there, stunned by the movie's delicacy and genius.<br/><br/>How wrong I was. I thought this was just going to be another simple-minded movie about another theory on the Kennedy's assassination. But this had every single element a good movie required, no more, no less. Why it didn't win the Best PIcture of 1991 is beyond me, I was still touched by Jim Garrison's pursuit of the ""truth""(at least the truth he believed in). The society lacks this kind of people. Searching the minority truth may occurred to somebody, but nobody dared to do that because their actions were always referred as ""fanatical"", ""useless"" and ""brainless"". Well, JIm Garrison defeated these accusations with great courage and steadfast dedication. The 40 minutes in the court was one of the most precious scenes ever filmed in movie history. This movie lasted for three hours, the shortest time in my life, personally. I've never seen any movie that divided three hours so neatly. Schindler's list had some redundant scenes, Dances With Wolves had some major plot holes, Tiatnic was too sappy, The Deer Hunter had a really need-to-cut marriage scene, and ONce upon a time was just plain boring. However, I can't even find a single flaw of pacing in three hours, not even one. THree hours of JIm Garrison's investigation seemed unilateral, but it never bored me. Instead, it gave me new insights into history, inspired me to seek the truth I believed in. In short, I have to quote;"" This is the shortest there hours I've ever spent in my life. ""<br/><br/>The actors were perfect. Kevin Costner never gave such a blistering performance ever since. Kevin Babon, Gary Oldamn and Joe Pesci were also very well-done. And we could forget the most memorable performance from Tommy Jones(Oscar-deserved). The cinematography was top-notch. And Oliver Stone immersed himself in directing, and his direction was much more better in this than in Platoon IMHO. This is Stone's best movie since Platoon. <br/><br/>How come this never didn't win the Best Musical Score in Oscar. The score boiled my blood, it made me revere Jim Garrison's eagerness in pursuing his truth. Lovely score.<br/><br/>The ending was one of the best endings I've ever seen. usually, I can have a definite feeling for the ending, but this one was surely the exception. THe ending kept me stunned in be-wilderness. I didn't know how to feel about the ending. IT was both uplifting and depressing. First, I was sad about (Possible Spoilers) JIm Garrison losing the case, and then I saw his outline walking towards the sunset as a symbol of the pursuit of truth, and then the lovely score began, I was stunned. I turned off the TV and had my breakfast without a word. I noticed how bad a government could be if it doesn't put people ahead of politics. <br/><br/>Now, I've watched JFK at least six times. Each time, 205 minutes flies away, but they were never wasted. Ecah time, I learned more and more about the movie, and more and more about the Pursuit OF THE TRUTH.<br/><br/>This is truly a GREAT movie, strongly recommend. My vote: 10/10."
"shadowman123","8","3","15","17 March 2008"," Mind-blowing!
","I once stumbled upon JFK on Sky One one Sunday unable to sleep , and although I did not get round to seeing all of it, it was nothing short of interesting. I then just last week purchased it and popped it into my DVD player last night. All I can say is that instead of interesting - it was fascinating! Nothing truly is white and black over here as we re-visit the faithful day when the President of the US was assassinated , I remember my father talking about the day vividly and the way he told my brothers and I about it. Truly my father never really believed all of the evidence , and after watching this Oliver Stone movie I truly believe that there has been a fabrication of the truth and that in Nov 22 , 1963 the Predident of the United States Of America was assassinated and America it-self underwent an invisible coup'd'ete. The most worrying thing about it is that in the year 2008, we get to see factors similar to this all round the world which show America's dominance and foot hold in trying to play the policeman of the world. The film paves the way the in a do-cu-drama style way and then paves the way forward for the trial that took place with the stunning of most visuals and set ups so no one is confused and Oliver Stone does this in such an easy way for us to follow. The script is sharp and tight so there is no silliness floating around but then also the acting from everyone and I MEAN EVERYONE WAS BRILLIANT! , throughout the entire movie there is a certain feeling of dread and one does realise that it is a mouse fighting a gorilla. I really am not sure how accurate it is but it seems that Oliver Stone has conducted his research on it! The film might also be long but try to see it as a case study that way your attention will be a lot focused. To conclude JFK is highly bold and provocative film making that probably would not be allowed to have been made today giving the highly politically charged and sensitive times we are living in today. It has to be observed on its on basis and probably requires us to go away and make up our own minds but one thing is for certain , we all smell conspiracy and I am just how the US will cover up Iraq which to most of us is the new Vietnam , this movie cannot be overlooked!<br/><br/>JFK : 8.4 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>THE STORY THAT WON'T GO AWAY..."
"johnnyboyz","8","3","15","25 January 2008"," Powerful, political, engaging and important; there isn't much JFK does wrong.
","I think JFK as a film succeeds on multiple levels. It manages to inform and educate without ever feeling like a lecture; it manages to entertain and engross without ever feeling like it's trying too hard to either offend you or maintain your interest with cheap gimmicks; it manages to create enough doubt and give you enough material to make up your own mind without ever feeling like it's insulting or patronising you. I very recently saw the recent acclaimed film The Queen which revolved around the death of a global icon, Lady Diana, but where that one was more about reaction, JFK is more about action.<br/><br/>The reason I found JFK to be better than The Queen is because it tells you of the assassination and then jumps forward three years, showing you how one man came to work out a possible conspiracy theory. Likewise with any subject; create a theory, a hypothesis and research your area of study. It can be science (Newton ¬ñ Gravity), mathematics (John Nash); hell even film/cinema (Mulvey ¬ñ The Gaze) but Jim Garrison (Costner) comes up with and works out a theory that Kennedy was perhaps killed in ways different to what we would all believe and that Oswald (Oldman) is not as guilty as you would think. This is the basis for the film and it works an absolute delight. Yes, the film's narrative is a little confusing and difficult to follow but keep reminding yourself that this is a theory one man is trying to crack; a sort of 'who dun it' in the vast world of 1960's America but the detective is one mere man with some researchers to back him up.<br/><br/>Comparing the film to another 21st Century detective tale is perhaps a little silly to do if I was comparing them in terms of quality but JFK very much reminded me of recent effort Zodiac; one man tries to find the truth behind a major event that remains unexplained but whilst Robert Graysmith was a comic book artist, Garrison is a man of the law anyway and we accept that he is up to the challenge. But JFK is arguably better because there is no definitive point of view. Witnesses and people who might know something give their own accounts through their own flashbacks; this is JFK acknowledging that its hero cannot know of other peoples flashbacks if he was not present at the time and thus; gives us impressive and dramatic black and white scenes revolving around either the death or events taking place somewhere else with someone else. Some examples here include Jack's (Lemmon) memory of being pistol whipped; Willie's (Bacon) memory of the gang talking about how great it would be if Kennedy died and Clay's (Lee Jones) memories of a homosexual romp at his house ¬ñ the genius here is that each flashback may be the truth, it may be a lie or it may be mere memory catching up with its harbinger.<br/><br/>Make no mistake that the film is political. This is a brave film from Oliver Stone and one that I'm sure opened the eyes of the people watching it; not just at what it was saying but perhaps made them question the assassination altogether. Getting back to The Queen; when Diana did die, the country was in morning and I can imagine a similar reaction to Kennedy in 60s America but how stupid, perhaps embarrassed, would those people have felt if they'd realised it was all a lie and that the government had her killed due to insider reasons? After the reaction and the funeral (which is in the top 5 most watched televised items in Britain's history) and everything else; how perhaps anticlimactic would it be if we all learnt she was deliberately murdered; indeed an inquest happening round about now might just un-turn some facts no one wants to know. But this is the film JFK at its core; one man who wants everyone to build up the courage to perhaps realise the inevitable: their country's government has been lying and what was once an event that brought the nation together; now motivates the people to turn away from the state.<br/><br/>JFK would have us believe a group of homosexuals set up a complex idea that killed Kennedy, for the first half. But the checkpoint arrives in the form of 'X' (Sutherland) who gives Garrison clues and information just when everything seems lost. After the press publicise Garrison's attempts, Jim is embarrassed and lost but it works FOR him as the papers are how 'X' discovers Jim to be so close. His monologue, maybe one of the longest if not memorable from 1990s cinema; sways not only Jim's view but ours: maybe this group are not so guilty and the government are up to no good. The fact 'X' thinks that the government thought that he was so good at cracking these things, he was shipped to the middle of snowy nowhere, could be an ego trip on X's behalf but it could be the disturbing truth; we might never know. JFK basically tells us one thing for the first half, telling us the argument's one side before flipping the proverbial pancake and letting the other half simmer whilst the one in focus now has its very own moment. JFK is almost a guerrilla film: its use of politics, its fast edits of real footage; perhaps subliminally blinding us with placards of 'Hooray for JFK' and its strong feeling of realism as it dawns on you that you are not watching fiction is eerie as it is brilliant. Apart from the genius of the depth; the film is still well acted with a sprinkling of stars, great dialogue and impressive cinematography. The argument Garrison delivers in the courtroom is fascinating as it is brilliantly executed, twinned with Oswald's 'real' actions ¬ñ a film that will captivate and spellbound, at least until 2039."

"jason_parallel","9","3","15","26 November 2006"," Stone's Masterpiece
","Controversies aside, this is one amazing piece of cinema. One of my top ten films, I have watched it dozens of times, and I always find something new to ponder over.<br/><br/>Visually and thematically, this is Stone's most ambitious movie, and we will probably never see its kind again: an epic story that forces the people that watch it to consider the possibilities of the director's argument. I have never met someone who has seen JFK and not had an opinion about it, one way or the other. The impact that this movie had before and after its release can still be seen today. Just Google ""Oliver Stone JFK"" and take a look at what various ""experts"" have to say about it! <br/><br/>My only true gripe with JFK is the way that Stone chose to display what he considers the evidence. He took all the theories, fed them through a spaghetti maker, and looped the pieces back together to try to make a visually stunning statement. The end result is indeed beautiful to look at, but it leaves those who don't know a thing about the JFK assassination feeling overwhelmed. For example, two characters in the film (played by Kevin Bacon and Donald Sutherland) were actually composites made up of different people at some point mired in the real Garrison investigation. In real life, there was no X (Sutherland), and there was no Willie O'Keefe (Bacon). Also, the movie is edited to a manic pace, leaving uninformed viewers confused at the landslide of theories that come tumbling their way. I feel that Stone did a great disservice to the true evidence by presenting the movie in such a way.<br/><br/>I am a firm believer that there was no magic bullet, Oswald was framed, and that there was a grand conspiracy to kill Kennedy. It seems to me that those who criticize the movie (especially some of the reviews I've seen on IMDb) have failed to grasp the facts of the case, and honestly, anyone who gets all their information about the JFK assassination from distorted and incomplete manuals such as the Warren Report or books such as Case Closed (by Gerald Posner, a obfuscating hack who has been proved wrong numerous times) will never understand the facts anyway. It's too bad that the movie does not show the theories in a more cohesive format.<br/><br/>That said, JFK is one of the most powerful movies ever made. Everything about it is intense, from the acting (especially Kevin Costner and Joe Pesci, who should've gotten an Academy award nomination for his portrayal of David Ferrie) to the editing, lighting, colors, and pacing. I can only hope that one day Oliver Stone decides to start making daring, controversial movies again!"
"deuxyeuxbleus","10","3","15","5 August 2006"," Oliver Stone's JFK
","""JFK"" is one of those films that you can't see just once. To absorb the complexity of the reams of information packed into such a 'short' space of time, as well as appreciate the art of the filmmaker, you need to see it at least half a dozen times. Oliver Stone mixes fact and fiction, real and imaginary events and characters, with such panache that it is sometimes very hard to distinguish between what is and is not true. But, at least, he stirred up some strong emotions in film goers, as well as reawakening people's interest in the assassination of John F Kennedy, which resulted in thousands of previously classified documents relating to that event being made public. And, to me, that can only be a good thing."

","""JFK"" is a remarkable accomplishment for director Oliver Stone, especially when you realize that his main protagonist, Jim Garrison, was in reality a total nut-case, not to mention a jerk. So Stone's first challenge was to create a likable and sane protagonist.<br/><br/>Stone was able to take elements of Garrison's book and the Clay Bertrand case, infuse it with tons of other information from other sources, and present the theory of a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy in a very engrossing and entertaining manner.<br/><br/>The editing and cinematography are dazzling, the casting is inspired, and the acting is superb -- even the wooden Kevin Costner is just right in the (extremely idealized) role of Jim Garrison. ""JFK"" stands up to repeated viewing. I recently watched for about the tenth time.<br/><br/>This film will have a deserved place in history, due to its impact on the public consciousness. When it came out, it reawakened the public debate over Kennedy's assassination. That is not a debate between conspiracy theorists and everyone else.

","Oliver Stone is a brilliant film maker. There's no doubt about that. But if you'll notice, this movie is not a documentary. It's a dramatic story, and it's a lot farther from the truth than you'd think. I'm not talking about the theory being wrong, because it's never been disproven; I mean that some of the ""facts"" that it presents are simply false. I'll give some examples: 1. Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't a very good shot.<br/><br/>This is just wrong. Oswald was a sniper in the Marines, and I saw a documentary where someone read off of his training log. Shooting at a target of similar size to Kennedy's body and at twice the distance, he hit 48/50. On another day, he hit 49/50 under the same circumstances.<br/><br/>2. Garrison's moving speech.<br/><br/>This never happened. In real life, Garrison had absolutely no evidence against Shaw and therefore had no case.<br/><br/>3. A large amount of the ""actual"" footage of the assassination.<br/><br/>Stone, being a brilliant film maker, combined reenactments with real footage to create his own images.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying this was a bad movie; it was excellent, but this movie is the last place you should look in deciding who you think shot the president."

"Manthorpe","10","3","15","17 June 2004"," Think for yourself, question authority.
","One of the most important films. Many will disagree with that, but it's not a statement just about the film itself, it's also about the fact that Oliver Stone had the balls to make this interesting political masterpiece. Anyone with half of a brain knows that the Warren Report was the biggest joke on the American public ever conceived, and Stone decided to rock the house with his theory about the Kennedy assassination. Is all of it true? Of course not, but that is entirely irrelevant. Do you think the magic bullet theory was true? Case closed. Time and time again, the US government has tried to fool us into believing their ridiculous theory to try and cover up the lies...and considering most people truly are stupid, it has worked. Why do you think that the full details are still not to be released for many years? Could it be that by that time, everyone guilty will be dead or the fact that we as a nation won't care as much anymore because it'll be old news? Gee, I wonder. The simple fact that someone put forth a theory about the JFK incident on film for the public to see is extremely important because it made people think, and still does. The people that bash this film because it's ""propaganda"" have entirely missed the point and are the same ones so easily fooled by the government. <br/><br/>Beyond that, JFK is an excellent film is all respects. It's about the investigation and the one and only court case that was brought to raise questions about the Warren Report to display the government for what it is, liars and murderers, by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison. Filled with an excellent cast and directed superbly, JFK raises many questions and still provides classic entertainment. A bit long for some, but most likely for those with a closed mind or those that are afraid to believe anything other than what the government tells us. baaa-baaaa. Carry on sheep people. ""Here's Love Connection, watch this and get fat and stupid, by the way, keep drinking beer you f***ing morons!"" If you know where that came from then you know where I'm coming from. R.I.P.<br/><br/>Forgive me for the comparison, but it is much like Dr. Strangelove in that it's not just a film, but one with a political statement. Of course, Dr. Strangelove is a better film and has much more of an important statement, but still, they're similar in that respect. <br/><br/>As mentioned previously, the cast is simply excellent and particularly Costner, Pesci and Oldman. Kevin Bacon and Tommy Lee Jones' characters are also humorous and depicted with skill. The cinematography is also something to be admired, and we get a good glimpse of this in the opening sequence. I especially enjoy how all of the scenes are put together, giving us something new at every clip and something different to consider.<br/><br/>All in all, a very important film that's worthy of much more recognition, the lack of which is probably due to the ignorant American masses that swallowed the Warren Report in the first place.<br/><br/>Incredible and extremely ballsy."

This is not only the best film of the year, its also an important film in our culture. This story will never go away and we can still rewrite history, all you have to do is search for the real truth. This movie my friend is a masterpiece, 4 stars. Go see JFK"
"Spike6363","10","3","15","25 July 2003"," A masterpiece
","One of my favorite directors is Oliver Stone, who is either called a conspiracy-riddled nutcase or a genius, depending on who you ask. Stone's 1991 film JFK shows me that he is the latter. I loved this film. In fact, I would have to say it is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>Released surrounded in controversey, JFK tells the story of a New Orleans District Attourney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), who was so rattled by John F. Kennedy's death that he decides to do his own investigation, and it takes him everywhere from New Orleans' homosexual underworld to the steps of the Lincoln Monument in Washington, D.C. where Garrison meets the mysterious Mr. X (Donald Sutherland).<br/><br/>Garrison then tries to convict one Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones in his Oscar-nominated performance) of conspirating with Lee Harvey Oswald. Through the film, we see Stone's conspiracy theory begin to make sense, and we see his attempt to show us, the viewer, what he thinks of this event in history.<br/><br/>
Stone's take on the assassination is incredible. He brings everything forward to the table, and this is the first film Stone made where he started using his rapid-fire editing style, switching back and forth from different film stocks, such as still photos, black and white film, color film, 16 mm stock, 35 mm, and more. This really keeps the viewer on edge, and it better -- this is one long film, the director's cut racking in at 3 hours and twenty-five minutes. The film flies by us, however, because of the Oscar-winning film editing.<br/><br/>All in all, I would have to say JFK is one of the best films of all time, tying with Pulp Fiction as my favorite film of the ninties. It's brilliant. See it. Now."
"digikidnh","10","3","15","8 June 2003"," Without a doubt Oliver Stone's best film
","Oliver Stone is easily the best director of his generation and without a doubt he has made more movies of social relevance than any other director of his generation and this film is the best film he has made even better than Platoon or Natural Born Killers and this says alot JFK has the best cast and best performances of any film of the 1990s the best performance is easily Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. Not only does Oldman literally become Oswald  but he becomes Oswald the man. Not Oswald the accused assassin you see Oswald interact with his wife Marina whom he brought back from russia but his relationship with his two infant daughters June and Rachel who he loved very much this movie is the only movie that showed Lee Harvey Oswald as a man not an assassin or a patsy or man posesed by the spirit of Dr. Sam"

"theatarislb","10","3","15","23 April 2003"," A great film in every sense
","This is one of the best films ever put out.  Very few films can be so factual, lack action, and still keep the viewers attention from the opening scene until the end.  Now, this does not go without saying that if one has no interest in JFK, history or anything else along those lines then they might find this film of little interest.<br/><br/>This film really made me think.  In any high school history book, you're going to read that Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK because he was a marxist fanatic.  That's it.  This film throws all your misinformation about the assassination of JFK right out the window, and it does so with great entertainment.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner carries the film very well.  Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci create wonderful characters, especially Joe Pesci as David Ferrie.  For me though, Donald Sutherland, calling himself X, the deepthroat-esque character in the film was really interesting to listen to.  No other actor could have given that compelling of a performance.  His subtleness is what is able to sell the character and the story that he tells Garrison about(Costner).<br/><br/>Overall, i felt this film was very interesting and insightful.  If you're looking for a great compelling drama or anything having to do with JFK, history, or conspiracies and how they're formed, see this great Oliver Stone film 9 stars out of 10!"

","Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" is a masterpiece!  Kevin Costner gives possibly his best performance ever as Jim Garrison, the D.A. of New Orleans.  The ensemble cast is excellent as well.  Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Walter Matteau, Donald Sutherland, Wayne Knight, Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon all give outstanding performances, mostly in walk-on roles. Gary Oldman plays such a good Lee Harvey Oswald it's scary.<br/><br/>The movie is based on ""On the Trail of Assasins"" by Jim Garrison. Garrison begins to investigate the murder of the president, and he soon finds that he's getting more than he bargained for.  He unravels a twisting tale of secrets and clues in his attempt to discover what really happened on November 22, 1963.  Cuba, the mob, the FBI and CIA, the White House - nobody is spared in Garrison's investigation.<br/><br/>Stone has put together a visual masterpiece.  His incredible blending of movie footage and real-life footage makes you wonder what is real and what isn't.  In addition, John William's score is, as always, awesome.<br/><br/>The big question viewers of this movie always have is: how accurate is Stone's conspiracy theory?  Upon its release, it received critism from many sources, including THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF (perhaps because someone finally caught on to them?)  It is hard to say if Stone is completely correct, but there are certain, undeniable facts.  There is the magic bullet theory, which Coster shows must be a lie because it is simply impossible.  There is also real footage of the assassination which shows Kennedy's head moving back and to the left, meaning the shot had to come from the front right. This film proves that Oswald - shooting from behind and above Kennedy - could not have been the lone shooter.  (In fact, Stone argues that Oswald didn't fire a single shot that day).  These facts and others show that Stone hits most, if not all, his marks.<br/><br/>This is one of the best movies of all time and a movie that all Americans should see!"
"kbuswell","9","3","15","28 September 2002"," You are being lied to
","This film is a lie. It is despicable propaganda. Stone distorts most of the facts and gets many of them plain wrong. It is revisionist history at its worst. If you are watching this film for a history lesson you are a sucker. However, if you are watching this film as a piece of fiction, you will be enthralled for three hours. This is a stunning piece of film making - probably Stone's best work ever. Allow yourself to be swept away by the power of Stone's vision, but remind yourself that it is just a film - and not a documentary."

","I've read a lot of the reviews here, and frankly, I'd rather comment on the movie, not the theories.<br/><br/>The performances here are superb.  This is one of Gary Oldman's defining performances--it took me over half the film to suddenly realize that Lee Harvey Oswald was in fact Gary.  He submerges so far into character that he is almost invisible--an incredible feat of acting that few can accomplish so easily.<br/><br/>Another wonderful performance is delivered by Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw. A truly subtle, interesting portrayal--all allegations about his behavior and involvement aside.<br/><br/>As a former Dallas resident, the theories no longer hold interest to me. This is not a historical document, but a movie.  But the comments on this site interest me, because they do show that ""JFK"" accomplished something--they awoke interest in a period of our nation's history that deserves interest.<br/><br/>I doubt that we will ever know the truth--but at least JFK has inspired many to look for it."

","It feels somewhat strange to be able to watch a film on DVD after 9 years having watched it on the big-screen.It was not the 'Director's Cut'(206 mins) though,but giving enough brain food to think of the conspiracies the worlds' governments producing.JFK,for me' is a name from the past,even before I was born,and being from Europe I have to admit I don't know much about him and his deeds;but watching this film 9 years ago I felt compelled to read about him finding out he was not the usual 'American patriot' people are used to see.He resisted something and paid for this with his life.The film's sayings may or may not be true but after the Congress decision of a 'conspiracy theme might be involved' in 1979,there still has not been any prosecutions or cases ever since,I think people might seek the truth in 2029,that's when the assasination files be disclosed.Still yet,Oliver Stone is a great name and I believe this was Kevin Costner's one of the most successful roles ever.If you think you can focus for about 3 hours I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be provoked towards seeking for truth and multiple layers of incidents that can take place anywhere in the world any-time and to those who desire more than 'shoot and dodge them ups'."

"contronatura","10","3","15","21 February 2000"," Riveting and chilling
","Oliver Stone's JFK is certainly not a film that should be taken as literal truth. It bends the truth in places in order for Stone to present his alternate history. But as cinema, there are few films that are this stunning. This is a genuine masterpiece - incredibly acted, directed, photographed, and written. And most importantly of all, Stone captures that period of time so well. He captures Dallas in all its corrupt mid-60s glory. He captures the atmosphere of criminal-ridden New Orleans. He captures the urgency of the 60s, and the craziness that era produced. But what he does best is present a film that is at once a fascinating mystery and a terrifying ""what-if"" tale. I would even go so far as to say that this is the pinnacle achievement in modern ""noir"" films - featuring a dogged investigator, his harried staff, and a group of shadowy criminals. Like I said, this film is not history. Jim Garrison in this film is nothing like he was in real life. But the film itself is a absolute masterpiece."

","Back, and to the left.  Back.....and to the left.  Three hours of film and this is the only thing I can recall.  To me, JFK was just 150 script pages of Oliver Stone's paranoia and bizarre ideas.  It seemed more suitable for a fanatic's webpage dedicated to his findings and beliefs, not a huge motion picture than someone against all laws of the universe snagged a Best Picture nod. (really sorry about last run on sentence) My head got so swamped with all this craziness, that I began to wonder what I was actually seeing.  Some people have called this movie boring, and for most skeptics, it IS boring. Those X-Philes and Anti-Government will probably love this, but the average working class schmoe has no patience for THREE HOURS of what I thought to be nonsense.

"Tetsel","9","3","15","11 August 1999"," It's Amazing...
","It's truly amazing how a film like JFK can stir up so many strongly opinionated responses. An issue such as this (the assassination of a president and the possibility of government conspiracy) is obviously very important to people. Therefore, I think that Oliver Stone was very right in making his film, and making it the way he did. Whether or not you believe him, believe some of what he says, or hate him for all of it, still he makes you think about the event, makes you remember it and become emotional about it (angry, curious, sorrowful, etc.) I think the greatest filmmakers are those who can interest and involve the viewers in their personal statements. Does Oliver Stone hope that everyone will fall for his version? I doubt it. Does he want people to question things? Yes. He wants you to question the events you heard the first time, whether it was on the news, in a history book, or from word of mouth. And yes, even his own accounting of it. The fact that so many people reacted to it means that there is something more to it than a paragraph in a history book. Was it communists? Was it the mob? CIA? FBI? Even LBJ?!? I don't know. I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't bet against it either. THAT'S the point."
"V Hanna","10","3","15","21 July 1999"," A Directing Achievement!!
","How did Stone do it? He took material that if you gave to ten other directors they couldn't make anything better than a shoe commercial and turned it into a riveting detailed great piece of film. Detail, detail, detail. This movie theorizes so well, even if it is all Stone's theories, that it's hard not to feel it's ALL true. Casting was also some of the best I have seen of a movie made in the nineties. Costner was solid, Oldman unbelievable, Pesci wild, Jones Oscarworthy, Candy a break from the norm, Bacon best of his career, Lemon great small role, and even Stone's kid (who played Jasper) got in there. Oldman was great. From a guy who has a thick British accent WOW!! Everything about Oldman's Lee Harvey, the twitches, irritability, shadiness, was perfect and just how I could picture Oswald. Sutherland as X was great, perfect role. I can't say enough of Stone's directing though. What really did it for me was the final court room scene. Most directors would have languished too long in the scenes leading up to Garrison's final speech (Sleepers was a big violator of this, it killed that movie), but Stone understood that you can't slow down the movie at this point, keep the frenzied pace and then let Garrison give you the perfect climax of what has been discussed at length in the plot. That is how a good courtroom scene is done and done effectively. The flashbacks were well used too. Stone showed you what was needed to make your mind believe it even more because instead of just saying something happened and having you take time to visualize it Stone gave you a little peak. It also allowed you to better place the characters to the events that were being discussed. Stone realized the size of information and events he was throwing at you in a short period of time, this was very apparent in the scene with Sutherland's X. This is a great movie that details one of the most significant events in our history. An event that truly altered our countries path. The best part was that it was presented in a grand fashion and told with great vigor and life. Bravo!"
"Gudhjem","10","3","15","4 June 1999"," The conspiracy of the millennium
","For people with an interest in the assassination of President Kennedy this film is a very good alternative to the far from perfect Warren report. With excellent performances from the entire cast, this movie combines the thoughts and theories of Jim Garrison and those presented in Jim Marrs' book.<br/><br/>Still this is basically Oliver Stone's own ideas as to what happened that day in Dallas and in the period leading up to it. Most people know Stone for his passion for the Vietnam War and even in this film we get a sub plot about this subject. But above all, this is a movie about a lost innocence. The political innocence and a hope for a better future both on political and racial issues. It's the story of a country with big problems and a refusal to deal with these.<br/><br/>One could argue that the JFK we are presented to is far to perfect considering the knowledge we have today. But he shall not be seen as a person but as the personification of new dreams for America. In this light the assassination was a terrible thing and as I see it that is what this film is all about. And of cause one man's quest for the truth. Jim Garrison, who is brilliantly portrayed by Costner. And it is a nice touch to have Garrison himself appear as Earl Warren.<br/><br/>The film is a must for everyone fascinated by the myth known as JFK and for those who like movies with a message."

","I know, I know already that that tag-line actually comes from A FEW GOOD MEN; it seems apropos however that the filmmaker/script adapter has such a low opinion of his film audience.  Not only does Mr. Stone believe that the American film audience can't handle the twists and turns of that tragic day when President Kennedy was murdered, he believes that he has to MAKE US see according to one scenario.  This is a prime example of a biopic that devises its own criteria for TRUTH and REALITY (2001 has A BEAUTIFUL MIND) but succeeds wildly in its own extravagance.  Today in mid-April 2002 I happened on its re-broadcast on a local TV affiliate and was startled how the sanitized dialogue segments seemed kind of like a badly dubbed Chinese kung fu extravaganza.  The film's power in images is still highly recommendable; go see it on DVD if you're over 18 and fully ready for the script's adult profanities.  It really shouldn't be broadcast without some sort of WARNING label that it is only skewing toward the TRUTH as we mortals can know it.

I had no clue who Jim Garrison was. I watched it, and just about everything Jim Garrison, and the other people said was documented. It was only then that I found out that 'JFK' was based in part on Jim Garrison's investigation.<br/><br/> Oliver Stone did his homework on this one! He did stick pretty much to what Garrison found out. He also worked with some of the researchers in the Kennedy assassination, like Robert Groden, and Dr. Ceryl Wect. Stone said that the film serves a public service in the way that it brings all of the substantial criticism in one place.<br/><br/> If you just take this as a movie, the acting, casting, and the directing is top notch! It is a star studded affair. there is even a cameo by Garrison himself, as Earl Warren! How's that for casting!<br/><br/> On the other hand, if you watch this for the message, and still say this is all fiction, do yourself a favor. Watch the British special 'The Men Who Killed Kennedy', or 'The JFK Assassination: The Jim Garrison Tapes'.

Whether or not you agree with Oliver Stone's theories based on the findings of Jim Marrs and Jim Garrison this film should present enough evidence such that one would be left in doubt as to what happened that day in Dallas. The complex web of conspiracy in this film also goes to prove why some people have been so willing to disbelieve conspiracy for so many years: it was just easier that way. As a drama it also works tremendously well the cutting and inserting of images which Stone used for the first time in his film has not been as effectively used by him since. John Williams's score is emotionally stirring and acts as a call to action. All the acting in this film is stupendous and further adds to the overwhelming impact that this film has.

","Little remains to be said about JFK at this point. Whether you agree or disagree with Stone's plot, the fact is JFK is a fascinating, masterful piece of film. A dense amount of material has been condensed into an engrossing and well-paced story (try reading the Jim Marrs book upon which the movie is partially based). The acting is first rate (yes, even Costner) with numerous small parts by well-known actors. From a technical point of view, JFK just may be the best-edited film ever. It is a classic. For an interesting double bill watch JFK followed by Platoon."

","John F. Kennedy. One of the best (if not THE BEST) president the U.S. ever had (or it will have)... ...and the conspiracy, that puts U.S. democracy on the test.<br/><br/>So how hard is than make a movie, which puts American citizens into the doubts. That they live in country, where can't you trust anyone, especially your government? Where it's dangerous to be a president with a guts?<br/><br/>Hard enough! But, all i can say is, that Stone had a guts to made a movie, that proves all this facts and shows us, who doesn't live in the U.S. such a different perspective on the States. And he did it great. He collected the best actors for their roles, not to mention the cinematography, editing, a mixes of old camera shots, Zapruders film, a stunning beginning.<br/><br/>And all i can say at the end. Thank you Stone, for opening my eyes with this masterpiece.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"MovieDood","10","3","15","25 November 2001"," An excellent, star-studded historical drama.
","I first saw 'JFK' a while ago, and have since seen it many times.  I love the broad range of interesting characters, the amazing sets, and the historical significance.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner stars as New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison, who, in the years following the Kennedy Assassination, conducts an investigation thats sole purpose is to find the true killers of President John F. Kennedy.  Along the way, he meets some of the most diverse characters I've ever seen in a movie. They include David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), a extra-nervous anti-Castro radical; Guy Bannister (Ed Asner), a sleazy P.I. who ran guns for an invasion of Cuba; Jack Martin (Jack Lemmon), Bannister's assistant; Willie O'Keefe, a gay male prostitute who heard conversations of many of the key players in the ""conspiracy""; ""X"" (Donald Sutherland), an anonymous defense department official who believes the assassination was a conspiracy in the government; and Dean Andrews (John Candy), a New Orleans lawyer who was approached to defend Lee Harvey Oswald by a mysterious man.  Eventually, Garrison arrests businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) and a thrilling, vivid court case ensues, whose verdict is not known until the last minute of the film.<br/><br/>All of the performers in the film portray their characters with equal gusto, and any hint of the actor or actress is forgotten; they become their characters.  Kevin Costner has a good accent and great screen presence. Sissy Spacek is also good as his wife, Liz Garrison.  Tommy Lee Jones, wearing a humorous wig, brings a certain class to his role.  The late John Candy, in one of his only dramatic roles, is wonderful as the jive-ing Dean Andrews.  Gary Oldman is perfectly cast as Lee Harvey Oswald, and his attitude and appearance perfectly reflect the accused assassin.<br/><br/>
In conclusion, 'JFK' is not only a history lesson, but it is also an entertaining period piece.  Despite its 'R' rating for extreme language and some violence, it is an excellent film, and, in my opinion, one of Oliver Stone's best."

","Really, it's not about whether you believe in Stone's theory or not, you have to admit that this is one amazing work. Clocking in at almost 3 hours running time, no problemo, it virtually whizzes by in a kaleidoscope of images, color, B&W, old news reels and fast editing. An all-star cast with some memorable performances, notably by Gary Oldman as 'patsy' Oswald, Jay O. Sanders and Michael Rooker as Garrison's aids and the always impeccable Joe Pesci. A special mention must go to Kevin Costner who delivers his best achievement to date.<br/><br/>Stone's best work, although he didn't get an Oscar for this one, maybe because he had already won twice in previous years, for 'Wall Street' and 'Platoon'. The way in which he recreates that fateful day in Dallas, TX, deserve the highest marks.<br/><br/>It's amazing the way this movie got attacked in the U.S media upon its release, proving that - well, I don't want to get into conspiracies here, who knows who's keeping a tab on the internet...<br/><br/>And the message still stands firm: be wary of your institutions!!!"

The criticism this movie received from the powers that be -- even before it hit the theaters is testament to its authenticity."
"DadSweet","10","3","15","1 February 1999"," ""CONSPIRACY:"" The American marginalization of a ""time honored"" concept.
","Perhaps most people don't know, the original script for JFK was based on (partly written by) attorney Mark Lane's book ""Plausible Denial.""  The book describes in blow-by-blow, minute detail the actual trial in a Miami Federal Court in which a jury agrees that JFK was murdered in a conspiracy.  [Isn't it ""funny"" that YOU haven't heard much about that trial and its outcome?]. Naively, Mark Lane assumed the federal trial (which featured subpoenaed witnesses who were CIA officials at the time of JFK's assassination) would settle the issue of JFK's murder.  I said, ""naively.""<br/><br/>Oliver Stone and Lane disagreed on content and certain characters.  Lane insisted on complete accuracy while Stone insisted on artistic control. Stone won.  Lane did not wish his name to appear in the credits to preserve his credibility (but Lane and Stone still parted friends).<br/><br/>Having said that, JFK is after all a brilliantly made film.  Also, the bad press received by the film was more of the American journalistic Establishment covering its self-righteous collective ass;  taking offense at an effectively executed in-your-face conspiracy movie.  Perhaps not so oddly, when the movie was first released the Establishment attacked the film's premise (based on ""Plausible Denial"") rather than its art ... which SERIOUS and impartial critics had to agree was good.<br/><br/>If nothing else, The Warren Commission Report is clearly a conspiratorial work.  As far as the men who murdered Kennedy in Texas... obviously they got away with it.  Stone's movie is rather mild on that score.  But it is excellent theater and a  good suspenseful mystery."
"saint#50","10","3","15","7 June 2001"," It all comes together here.
","Let it be said, this is Stone's best film.<br/><br/>Hollywood has been shirking the relentless pursuit of truth in this film for the last ten years.  It was released to great controversy, but not the right kind.  The media (vafenculo) played up the fact that Stone had 'tampered with history.'  Isn't an artist required by definition to be uncompromising in his vision?  I think that the questionable scenes based on witness testimony or the Zapruder film are not fictitious at all, by mere definition.  <br/><br/>How much of the film is incorrect?  Maybe two-five mins. total; this picture, however, is well over three hours.  Three hours of historical revelation (at least it's revelatory for those who don't read books) and all the press can focus on is those couple of minutes that probably have more truth to them than most Americans would feel comfortable thinking. <br/><br/>
The U.S. involvement in Central America and Southeast Asia were journalistic non-events, kept from public scrutiny by the corridors of power.  That hardly nobody in this country knew (knows) about them in any detail is the fault of the Washington propaganda machine.  That Stone puts 'JFK' into mass circulation and Americans knowingly permit the media to dismiss the film as controversy hype and inaccurate is much less than sheltered ignorance.  It is sedition of the worst kind--an intellectual and social shirking of one's duty to eliminate falsehood from history and forbid the tampering of the collective consciousness around the world.<br/><br/>As Garrison (Costner in the film) says, ""...it was a coup d'etat...""  At least admit it."
"jintz","7","3","15","13 May 2001"," A must
","A truly excellent film, but one which I suspect is more for the casual historian as opposed to the usual film-goer. Being around 3 hours long, I have to admit I found it rather tedious at times, particularly as  the characters have no more idea of proceedings than the viewer. Intelligent acting and skilled direction however, makes this a highly polished documentary and one which every person should make the effort to watch. Probing and really quite a disturbing portrait of the way in which society can be ruled in the twentieth century western world."
"stefanhoeffllin","10","3","15","20 April 2001"," J.F.K. - just a few thoughts...
","Possible spoilers<br/><br/>I recently watched ""Thirteen days"", a screen adaptation of the Cuba crisis in 1962. A reason for me to watch ""J.F.K."" again - which I have seen a several times before. <br/><br/>The 22nd November 1963 was possibly the darkest day in the history of the USA. President John F. Kennedy was killed on his visit in Dallas. Lyndon B. Johnson became the new president on the same day. The Warren Commission was instructed to investigate the case. Their version: it was the act of one single man - Lee Harvey Oswald. Jim Garrison (believable: Kevin Costner), district attorney in New Orleans doesn¬¥t believe that official theory and decides to reopen the case. <br/><br/>Oliver Stones history lesson shows a lot of facts, but it¬¥s hard to treat them completely. I try to mention some important things that moved me. The first thing was the ""Magic bullet""-theory. The traces on J.F.K.¬¥s head showed three bullet-holes. The shots must have hit him from different directions. The explanation of the Warren Commission: it must have been ONE and the same bullet that hit him several times. Unbelievable. Did they think people are so stupid to believe this?<br/><br/>Another fact that shocked me was how they falsified the testimonies of the witnesses and destroyed important evidences.  I have read about an inquiry from 1967 which said that 60% didn¬¥t believe in the correctness of the Warren-report; 44% believed that it was conspiracy. Reasons that make you doubt the credibility of a democratic government. If John F. Kennedy had survived, there would have been no war in Vietnam. He had to die just because he tried to change something...<br/><br/>Though its running time of 3 hours, ""J.F.K."" keeps you at the edge of your seat - especially during the courtroom scene. A hypnotizing score by John Williams, a terrific cast. By the way it was genius to cast the real Jim Garrison for the role of Earl Warren! This is probably one of the best films of its genre.<br/><br/>One word: Powerful!"
"Mark_Alldridge","10","3","15","12 April 2001"," Accurate or not, this is an incredible piece of filmmaking.
","If you haven't seen this film then I urge you do so. Ten years on from its release, I still think this is the best MADE film I have ever seen. Even if you don't have an interest in the JFK assassination, I think that any fan of film should watch this and appreciate it for what it is: An incredible piece of filmmaking made by a man at the peak of his powers.<br/><br/>So what is good about this film?<br/><br/>Well plenty. From the ground up it smacks of quality. The script is fantastic (and there is a LOT of it). It has an incredible cast who all deliver astonishing performances (Joe Pesci is amazing) - there isn't a weak performance in this film. The photography is fantastic and the way the film is put together (with incredible editing than won an oscar) - at times the line between documentary footage and filmed footage becomes blurred and this creates an unerring sense of realism. It has a superb soundtrack from John Williams, largely consisting of horns that just oozes passion. - and that is this film in a nutshell really. It's passionate. Oliver Stone weaves his magic with such incredible vigour that by the time the film finishes, you are left feeling half exhausted.<br/><br/>So what's wrong with it? Well after you have seen it, you need to remind yourself that this is a film - and that's all it is. It is not a definitive documentary account of the events surrounding JFK's assassination, but merely a take on events by a man who has a clear idea of what he himself believes.<br/><br/>I think one of the reasons why this film caused such a stir when it was released - and still promotes debate, is that it WORKS. Oliver Stone has made a fantastically powerful film here that for me just underlines how great the medium can be. If you haven't seen it, then I urge to get a copy, sit down without interruption and watch it. Then you can decide for yourself."
"Howlin Wolf","10","3","15","1 April 2001"," Invigorating retelling of a defining moment in history.
","""JFK"" was one of those films in my uncle's collection that he said I should watch, and initially, I wasn't very keen. After all, the film weighs in at about 3hrs and concerns a man I had never had much interest in. The impressive cast list almost swayed me numerous times, but I still deferred...<br/><br/>Then we were required to watch the opening segment as part of filmic analysis in a Media Studies class. Often, this provided an excuse to turn the brain off for a few minutes and look at the pretty pictures. I was unable to do that with ""JFK"". It got me uncomfortably but fascinatingly close to the action, something that Oliver Stone seems to have a knack for doing, judging by his previous movies that I've seen. I then borrowed the movie off my uncle, and now own a copy. The film makes the things you may have seen or heard previously about the assassination a thousand times more interesting. If you're in the fortunate position of ALREADY finding this stuff interesting, so much the better.<br/><br/>When I read the reviews posted on this site for various films, I do not immediately take them for the gospel truth. I like to judge things for myself. At the same time, I'm interested in other people's opinions, whether they align with or contradict my own. Surely the intelligent will realise that this is merely Oliver Stone's OPINION about what happened on that fateful day. He may be right, he may not, but the fact that some of it may be pure conjecture doesn't make it any less entertaining a film to watch.<br/><br/>Standouts in the cast are Lee Jones and Oldman. Lee Jones in particular delivers a performance that is at once delightfully camp, yet also eerily sinister. Oldman is as good as ever. The man cannot deliver a bad performance, even in horrid films (Romeo is Bleeding)<br/><br/>The music score is terrific at helping to convey the sense of being on the verge of a momentous breakthrough. It's also gratifying to see that Stone devotes a fair amount of time to documenting how the case affects Garrison's relationship with his family, rather than simply sticking to the bare bones of the investigation. True, it would have been a shorter film, but also much less interesting.<br/><br/>Stone is at his best when he has definite targets to aim for through his work. Where ""Platoon"" failed for me was that it conveyed the message that war is hell, but did so in a vague, lazy way. ""Salvador"", by contrast, took you right into the heart of the conflict and never let you forget the futility of it all. ""JFK"", I'm pleased to say, is closer in spirit to the latter because it stirs the emotions through the passion of the director. It made me care about an event I previously regarded as unimportant, because now I see the value of fighting for the truth to be revealed, whether it be Stone's version or otherwise."
"Jim Griffin","10","3","15","25 February 2001"," A true masterpiece
","I was fourteen or fifteen when I first saw JFK, and its passion gave me a passion not just for the assassination conspiracy but for history in general.  I'm now writing my dissertation on Kennedy as part of my history degree and there was an irony in seeing the film again - the film that had got me interested in the first place - because I couldn't help finding fault with some of its conclusions.<br/><br/>JFK argues that Kennedy was killed because he had wanted to pull America out of Vietnam and ease relations with the Soviet Union, something that the military-industrial complex simply wouldn't allow.  It was this idea that I had problems with because it was Kennedy who had sent over 15,000 American troops to Vietnam, and who may have provoked the Cuban Missile Crisis because of overt and covert moves against Castro.  I was worried that this would ruin the movie, but historians argue so endlessly and I've changed my own mind so often that I just ignored the would-be niggles.  Besides, if the facts don't necessarily support this idea of Kennedy now, it was undoubtedly the perception at the time so may well have been the motive behind the assassination.<br/><br/>There are further problems that pedantic historians have complained about; a number of composite or fictional characters, genuine testimony transplanted to fictional locations, and the use of both real and recreated archive footage combine to undermine its credibility.  These, too, can be forgiven because JFK has a responsibility not just to provide facts, but to provide a coherent narrative, and it would have been impossible to have uncovered every word that was spoken during the Garrison investigation or kept them in their original context.  A degree of manipulation and invention was necessary.  Without these compromises, JFK would have lost much of its atmosphere and been a far weaker film, so I was happy to let them pass.<br/><br/>Even with these criticisms, JFK remains a masterpiece, by far the best film from occasional genius Oliver Stone.  I can't think of any movie that has the same sense of urgency, of outrage and passion, and such determination to convince.  Adapted from two books, the screenplay is perfect and is testament to Stone's skill that he could take the masses of evidence and turn it into a coherent script, with co-writer Zachary Sklar.  Following District Attorney Jim Garrison, the only man to ever bring a suspect to trial in the murder of the President, the film is utterly convincing in its criticisms of the Warren Commission Report and in its presentation of the conspiracy behind the assassination.<br/><br/>It boasts perhaps the greatest ever ensemble cast, including Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Walter Matthau, Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Gary Oldman, Brian Doyle-Murray, Wayne Knight, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Bob Gunton and Jim Garrison himself.  The last name, in the role of Earl Warren, should prove that, contrary to popular belief, Stone has a fine understanding of irony.  The weakest link in the stunning cast is Costner, but he gives his best performance in the lead role and manages to avoid his wooden delivery for most of the mammoth running time.  Even when he stumbles, he carries the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>His performance is certainly enough to make the final forty-five minute courtroom scene the greatest and most electrifying I've ever seen.  We are bombarded with evidence of the conspiracy, of the Warren Commission cover-up, of the convenient deaths of witnesses and critics, and are shown the notorious `magic bullet' theory and the terrible footage taken by Abraham Zapruder.<br/><br/>Within his air of excitement at revealing the conspiracy and his determination to find his truth, Stone never forgets the truth that everyone can agree on; that Kennedy was not just a President, but a man, who was murdered as his wife sat next to him.  Whether you believe the Kennedy legacy or not, it is a hard heart that doesn't break to see the final bullet strike him, to see his wife reach out across the boot of the car to rescue the debris, and to see his young son salute his father's coffin as it passes.  The respectful tone that is taken throughout is perfect.<br/><br/>Historians should be grateful to Oliver Stone for bringing history to a wider audience, one that a documentary simply would not have reached.  Its flaws are necessary to this end, and when Stone himself talks of his film in terms of a counter-myth, you realise he was not merely in search of the truth, but in search of other people who seek the same; this should be the only starting point.  JFK is a film that should make you angry and make you ask more.  For me, at least, it did both."
"rcastl2335","10","3","16","11 March 2011"," A Great American Black Comedy
","Beautifully directed, photographed and edited, well acted--even with some notably odd Southern accents and written with an eye toward the absurd and Gothic, JFK ranks as one of the best American political satires since Dr. Strangelove. Jim Garrison's summation of the ""case"" is one of the funniest set pieces since Chaplin ate his boot or Slim Pickens (in Dr. Strangelove) went through the Air Force survival kit for his bomber crew. Of course, if you attempt to take it as history, you run up against what another great writer/director, James Cameron, said: ""Oliver Stone has an interesting philosophy. His view is that history is so f...ed up, it's a consensus hallucination. So he will create an equal but opposite untruth to try to counteract the untruth that we live with. It's a BS theory."""
"anthony-cooper303","10","3","16","6 March 2006"," Highly recommended viewing
","The film goes some way in exposing the killers of Kennedy, and their motives. As a dramatisation of history it is very successful, but it is eclipsed by the documentary JFK:The Bush Connection, which adopts a no-holds barred approach in naming the main perpetrators of the murder. The acting performances in JFK are superb, the late John Candy displaying his best ever film character performance. The cinematography is excellent, and the film editing, incorporating documentary film which segues seamlessly with Oliver Stone's shots, is absolutely brilliant. The use of music and sound effects heightens the drama at the appropriate moments and is used very selectively to attain Stone's desired result. The abridgement of such a wealth of post-Kennedy information in regard to Kennedy's murder is a task in which Stone was quite successful, but like Mark Lane, author of Plausible Denial, I felt Stone did not go far enough in pointing the finger of accusation at Howard Hunt who was shown to be one of the organisers of the assassination team in an American court of law. It is a film that will upset many in high places as it gets too near to the truth for their liking."

","What I think everyone should remember, whether talking about the believability of the movie or the character of Garrison, is that JFK is a movie. A REPRESENTATION of not even fact, but theory. Personally, I think there was more to it than a guy in a book depository, but one can not draw solid conclusions from this movie. Oliver Stone wanted everyone to start thinking that a conspiracy was involved in his murder, in order to accomplish that he had to do go beyond even possibly what he believes and know that anyone watching will at least meet half way, believing some things and dismissing others. Overall, it was a fantastically made MOVIE. But that's what it was. The movie itself is BASED on true facts that occurred (the trial and everything that happened in the movie more or less happened) and the theories in the movie are displayed for the audience to decide upon (even with a strong bias). So make your own decision, no one will really ever know what happened except for the man or men who pulled the trigger and whoever, if anyone, contracted that person. I wouldn't get too hot about the whole topic anyways. Closure is over rated, trust me."
"didi-5","7","3","16","16 August 2004"," king of conspiracy theories
","The buzz created by this 'what if?' questioning of the Kennedy assassination led to a lot of negative press junking Oliver Stone's film as overheated tosh.  Using the real-life theories of Jim Garrison (played winningly here by Kevin Costner) the movie delves into all sorts of conspiracy theories involving multiple gunmen, duped decoys, split identities, and government cover-ups.<br/><br/>Taken as a whole the film is watchable and pervasive, sowing serious doubts on the 'lone gunman' explanation of the murder.  Lee Harvey Oswald (another memorable performance from Gary Oldman) is seen as a patsy who died for the will of a much higher power; his murder so soon after that of Kennedy smacks of fanaticism and a need for the real killers to sell him out as the sacrificial lamb.  This is where Garrison's story is coming from.<br/><br/>In the cast we find Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland (in an electrifying and impenetrable cameo), and Sissy Spacek all contributing to a tightly written drama of disparate theories that don't quite come together.  As entertainment, all this works fine.  As an attempt to rewrite history, it is perhaps too unwieldy to be of any real use."

"gregsrants","9","3","16","15 February 2004"," One of the Best of the 1990's
","It was with 1991's JFK that director Oliver Stone began to show us his true directing style.  Whereas Platoon and even Born on the 4th of July were mainstream-by-the-unwritten-rules kind of filmmaking, JFK began to show both a directing and editing style that would become his benchmark years later. With dramatic moments intercut with images such as racehorse hoofs churning up dirt or close-ups of coffee swilling in a cup, Stone began offering films that were a jolt to the senses. 	 JFK was also the first of the Presidential entries into his filmography (Nixon and the executive produced The Day Reagan Was Shot), and follows the investigation of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and the suspicious circumstances  surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas 1963.<br/><br/>Garrison is played by Kevin Costner, a year removed from his breakout directorial debut, Dances With Wolves, and follows the DA as he re-opens the case questioning the findings of the Warren Commission three years later. Leading a team that includes actors Laurie Metcalf, Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight and Jay O. Sanders, Garrison tracks down old eye-witnesses and follows leads left behind by the F.B.I., in hopes of finding the conspiracy that he feels so passionately has been covered up.  Along his odyssey, Garrison meets various degrees of opposition and soon fears for the safety of his team and family in hopes of uncovering the truth. <br/><br/>
JFK was filmed at the height of Stone's popularity and that can be seen on how many famous faces lined up for a role ¬ñ no matter how small or trivial ¬ñ in this 3 hour epic.  Just glancing at the cast listing and you will see names like Kevin Bacon, Ed Asner, Gary Oldman, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland and Tommy Lee Jones just to name a handful.  They are paraded out in rapid fire style and range from quick cameos to larger plot point characters.  Stone does well to manage the various egos that were involved and keep the story on track, undistracted from the ever present star power.<br/><br/>The screenplay for JFK was taken from various sources including Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs and On The Trail Of The Assassins by Jim Garrison.  Coupled with various liberties by screenwriters Oliver Stone and Zachery Sklar, the film ventures down various possibilities as to the mastermind behind the plot including the C.I.A., Cubans & even the Vice President.  With all the assumptions and suggestions put forth by the director, Stone achieves the goal of leaving the audience with a notion that there were too many possibilities as to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and was nothing more than the ¬ëpatsy' he professed. <br/><br/>
The courtroom scenes near the conclusion of the film are riveting entertainment and offer edge of your seat conclusions as the facts pour into the audiences lap for interpretation.  Stone flashes between actual footage and court scene descriptions to fill the final 45 minutes with a recap of the information obtained by their various sources.  Not until A Few Good Men did a courtroom scene offer such drama and tension.<br/><br/>JFK was also a political statement for Stone.  Vocal through the late 80's and early 90's on the government and the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, you can tell by watching JFK that Stone would believe anything but the fact the government's findings may be correct.  This however does not take away from the impact of JFK, but does lead to some interesting discussion at the end of the film.   Labeled by many as one of the best films of the 1990's, JFK is a treat for film goers, conspiracy theorists and even ¬ñ to some extent ¬ñ historians, and should not be missed.  Being nominated for 8 Academy Awards and winning two is a testament to this masterpiece."

Never before did I feel like an American robbed of my King. Rest in Peace Jim Garrison and the others who sought the truth. We are still seeking the truth even now."

"baumer","10","3","16","21 July 1999"," An alternative to the Warren Report
","No one is saying that this film is exactly what happened on Nov. 22nd 1963. Nobody is saying that this is the solution to the great mystery, but what Stone is saying is that this is one possible alternative to one of the grossest lies ever told to the American people and the rest of the world. People that attack this film and dismiss it for being propoganda are missing the point.  If this is propoganda, then what the hell is the Warren Report that says that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone?  A comic strip?<br/><br/>Forget politics for just one second and just look at the beauty of this film.  Because that is one thing that is lost in all the politics of this film, we forget what a truly incredible work of art this is.  You will never find a film that is better acted, better photographed, better directed or edited than this.  You can't.  This film is perfection on every level that is film.  Now you can believe what you want to believe, but what you can't deny is how the film makes you feel.  And for me, it made me mad that a crime like this could be committed.  Is there really anyone out there that really thinks that LHO could really fire off three shots that quickly, 5.6 seconds with the acuracy that he did?  Does anyone not find it strange that the final head shot caused his head to go back and to the left, not down and to the right ( which would happen if he was shot from the book depository )? We all know the inconsistencies with the case that are quite factual, the ones that are not embellished by Stone.  Kennedy's brain did disappear, the limo was ordered clean so that evidence was impossible to come by.  The parade route was changed, the protective bubble was removed, a proper sweep of the area was not conducted.  People's testimonies were altered on FBI reports, David Ferry lied to Garrison, the Warren report was run by guys that Kennedy had once fired, suspicious deaths of people that testified in the Warren Report happened frequently, and the magic bullet theory is impossible.  Seven wounds, one bullet, that is quite impossible.  So if you take into account all that is irrefutable about the case and the movie, why do so many people get mad when an alternative theory is presented.  Surely no one really buys into the Warren Report.  Do they?  How about Oswald being shot by David Ferry?  Too many strange things surrounding this case for it to be closed as easily as it was.  So now Stone comes along and has a different theory, a brave one, and people critisize him for it.  Well at least he and Garrison were willing to look in other corners for the truth. Someone had to try.<br/><br/>To talk of the film in parts is futile because there is not one part of this film that lacks.  The ensemble cast from Costner as Garrison, to John Candy as Dino, to Joe Pesci as a overly hyper David Ferry to Kevin Bacon as a Willy O' Keefe who thinks that Mr. Garrison is a good looking man, down to Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight, Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Jack Lemon, Walter Mathau, Donald Sutherland and Gary Oldman, every performance in here is remarkable.  They make you feel like you know these characters.  What Oliver Stone has done here is make one of the greatest if not the greatest motion picture I have ever seen.  I still believe that Jaws is the best ever, but JFK is a close second.  Except for it's politics, this film is not open for discussion in terms of how good a MOVIE it is.  Strictly on a film level, the film is flawless.<br/><br/>Finally, there is one shot in this film that I think is the greatest shot ever in the history of the movies.  At the very end of Garrison's speech, he says the words "" It's up to you.""  And as he does, the camera gets level with his eyes, so that he is now speaking with every person that watched this film.  And it is up to us to make the decision.  Are we going to swallow all that we have been fed by the government over the years, or are we going to accept the fact that there is more to the story that what the Warren Report says there is?  Maybe not Stone's version, but something.  At least give Stone credit, he is the only one really brave enough to tackle something like this and live to tell about it.  I'd love to see more films like this that question our government.  Because they make you think.  And that is always a good thing.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone has made an incredible film and it is one that should be watched at least once by everyone, especially by young people that don't know much about the case or the assassination.  I was 19 when this film came out.  I saw it and it changed my life.  It made me open my eyes to lies and deceit that our government is capable of doing.  And that is not reserved to the American government, it could be the Canadian, Australian, German whatever.  It is important to question the official version of what is fed to us.  And if you dig a little deeper, you will see there is always an alternative to what they want you to believe.  This film opened my eyes to that.  And I am a better person because of it."

","While I'm not ready to dismiss all conspiracy theories related to the assassination of the 35th President of the United States, I find this one, and others like it to be an outrageous piece of communist propaganda, in fact, one of the most blatantly distorted views of the world in film history, right up there with ""Birth of a Nation""(1915),"" Triumph of the Will(1935),"" ""I Am Cuba(1964),"" and ""The People's War in Laos(1971)."" The idea that Kennedy wanted to give up the war in Vietnam, and the so-called ""evidence"" that Oliver Stone uses to back that notion up is loaded with holes.<br/><br/>For one thing, the TV news footage at the beginning, where Kennedy says...""it's their war,"" also included him standing by his commitment to defend South Vietnam, and the rest of Southeast Asia from the threat of communism, which was deliberately left out. What he also ignores is the fact that Kennedy only pulled a small number of troops out in 1963, in order to scare the scare Ngo Dinh Diem out of his own repression, and not because he wanted to turn the region over to the reds. Like most presidents during the cold war, he knew that North Vietnam wasn't only a threat to the south, but to Laos & Cambodia as well. Otherwise they never would've armed the Pathet Lao & Khmer Rouge, which proves that THIS WAS NOT A CIVIL WAR.<br/><br/>In an interview in some magazine, Oliver Stone claimed that if Kennedy had never been shot, ""The Massacre in Southeast Asia would never have happened."" Sorry, Ollie, But it would've happened no matter who was president, because the USSR, Red China, and North Vietnam all made it happen."
"Pelrad","10","3","16","18 March 1999"," The second greatest movie ever made
","Most of what I had to say about this film has already been captured in other users' comments, some of which are excellent reviews. JFK struck me as being mostly about the virtues of truth, courage, and justice - about how precious truth is and how easy it is for people to cower away from it. Some of the dialogue was spectacular: 1. When Garrison is arguing against the theory that JFK was assassinated by the maffia; 2. When he battles with his wife over the importance of his work in order to make the country a better place in which his children can grow up; and 3. His presentation during the trial. When he kept running the tape over and over showing the president's head exploding, I broke down and cried. I couldn't believe that such an event could have been allowed to occur and how the investigation by the officials of one of the cruelest murders in history could have been so sloppily done.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone has been criticized for making an over-statement and for weaving fiction into the facts. I found the film ""In the Name of the Father"" as an appropriate example, unlike JFK, of ""overstatement"" - of how pedantic ""shoving it down your throat"" style weakens rather than strengthens the film's message. The fact that one of the most respected and loved world leaders in history was assassinated and no-one knows by whom and why makes it impossible to over-state the drama. I thought that Stone's ""weaving in fiction"" is poor criticism. In order to make the film interesting, you could not have the camera following Garrison's reading documents. Instead, you must have dialogue. So, Garrison meets the mysterious Mr. X played by Canadian actor Donald Sutherland. It is acceptable, to me, to have the methods in which facts were discovered fictitious as long as the facts themselves are real. And this is what Stone did.<br/><br/>The performances, direction, and editing of this spectacle were first rate and made the film intense to the fullest degree. I also liked the fact that the film focused on the greater issues, touching on other assassinations of the time - Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.. Finally, the fact that the film featured an all-star cast soothed my heart. It was kind of like Hollywood was saying that this atrocity was such a disgrace, ""we're getting our best people to make it known to the world"". ""JFK"" is the second greatest movie ever made (right behind ""Lorenzo's Oil""). (10 out of 10)"

"lois-lane33","6","2","9","21 October 2014"," Too long.
","This is a well crafted film, but at 189 minutes, I think it could have used serious editing. I can handle 90 minutes to 2 hours if it is a really good film, but at 3 hours, I'm done before it is. There are plenty of conspiracy theories about JFK out there but I'm not really interested in them. This film informs, but it also expects too much from the viewer. I can remember reading about the now famous speech given by JFK in Germany where he accidentally called himself a cocktail-when what he really meant was to compliment Germany by saying today he was a German-by way of identifying himself as a citizen of Berlin. As a compliment to Berliner's. And to all German's. What he had technically had said was: 'I'm your not secret undercover German President of the USA.' That's a much more strange verbal concoction than accidentally called himself a ""cocktail."" Nobody ever talks about that. He could have just said 'I thank you all for being so welcoming to me on my trip to Germany.' I think it was a long succession of verbal gaffs like ""the Berliner bit"" that ultimately caused the assassination of JFK. In terms of conspiracy theories I don't know if saying a thing was probably caused by something actually qualifies as a conspiracy theory since I have no theory as to what that idea might entail. Specifically. The film JFK doesn't add to anything in terms of the story of what happened to JFK. We know he was shot & killed. We know they figured out who shot & killed him not long after he was shot & killed. We also know the guy that shot & killed him was himself shot & killed not long after he was taken in by the authorities. End of story. Knew all that stuff ages before the JFK movie came out. So did everybody else and his brother."
"ferguson-6","7","2","9","22 November 2013"," Mystery, Riddle, Enigma
","Greetings again from the darkness. Fifty years to the day after the tragic assassination of President Kennedy seems like the best time for me to finally write something about Oliver Stone's controversial 1991 film. As a Dallas resident, the hallmark event has never been far removed, either mentally or geographically. I periodically see movies at the Texas Theatre where Oswald was captured. It's impossible to drive downtown and not regularly pass the Texas School Book Depository and Dealey Plaza. The reminders are always present and maybe that's a good thing.<br/><br/>When this movie was released, it shook the dust off the story and brought much attention back to the crime that had once seemed so quickly solved. The conspiracy theorists embraced Mr. Stone's work and even those who knew little of the Warren Report were swept up in the details and accusations. It was so easily accepted as an investigative presentation, and it was a way for the people to finally get what they wanted ... the answer to what happened and why.<br/><br/>Viewing the film this week again for the first time since 1991, it's understandable why so many were swept up in the frenzy. This is an expert presentation of a staggering number of theories and details and characters. With a run time well over three hours, the only opportunities for an exhale come during the somewhat lame interactions between New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) and his wife (Sissy Spacek). Othewise, it's a very well written parade of movie stars that is exceptionally photographed and expertly edited. Newsreel footage, reenactments, and dramatizations of events successfully create a mind puzzle. The film grabs you and does not let go ... and this is 22 years after release and 50 years after the assassination.<br/><br/>Now don't mistake that praise for believability. While Stone's approach has been attacked from all sides, he did publish an annotated script ""proving"" his details. Still, his blending of theories is staggering: the military, the CIA, the FBI, LBJ, the Mafia, the pro- and anti-Castro types, the Russians, and even a likely corrupt businessman. The latter is Clay Shaw, played with evil enjoyment by Tommy Lee Jones in a role worthy of a movie unto itself.<br/><br/>In Stone's version, Garrison is the voice of truth. He's the guy that doesn't buy off on the Warren Report. In fact, this movie version of Garrison represents us as the viewer ... the citizens who want to believe our government, but are too rational to accept things spoon fed to us. This isn't so much a courtroom drama or investigative report, it's more like a data dump. Stone is delivering all of the little doubts in one fell swoop. In other words, with all of these possibilities and unexplained events, how could it not be a conspiracy? Was it a coup d'etat with LBJ waiting in the wings? That makes sense if you believe defense contractors were unwilling to sit quietly as JFK pulled out of Vietnam. Was Oswald a patsy as he claimed? That argument can certainly be supported. More than one gunman? 5.6 seconds, a tree in the eye line, and smoke from the grassy knoll can lead to that conclusion. The movie serves as our emotional outburst at not knowing why this happened and who was responsible. We like our mysteries solved and this one apparently never will be.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert once said that facts are for print and emotions are for film. Oliver Stone seems to excel at the latter. He gives us permission to be paranoid. He takes extreme dramatic license with two extended soliloquies: Donald Sutherland as ""X"" (Fletcher Prouty) and Kevin Costner as Garrison in the courtroom. Neither of these events are probable, in fact the courtroom scene is borne from numerous Garrison speeches, quotes and book passages over the years.<br/><br/>This 50th anniversary has brought at least three new JFK inspired films: Parkland, Killing Kennedy, and Letters To Jackie. Three very different approaches to the man and the event that changed the world ... it changed our perceptions and our expectations. Oliver Stone's film gave us permission to do so out loud."
"poe426","10","2","9","21 November 2013"," Stone's stones...
","If there's one thing Oliver Stone doesn't lack, it's GUTS. He speaks his mind, and stands behind what he says; you can't ask for more than that. JFK is an absorbing account of one of the more heinous criminal acts of the 20th century (everything that followed, as Stone has observed, has been a Backward Progression). The recent book by Thom Hartmann collaborator Lamar Waldron, THE HIDDEN HISTORY OF THE JFK ASSASSINATION, gives us yet another detailed look at the murder, based in part on FBI wiretaps of the Mafioso allegedly involved. It's been suggested, too, that a rookie Secret Service man accidentally fired the fatal shot that killed Kennedy. Until the million or so pages of classified information about the assassination are made public, speculation is all we really have. I have my own theory, of course: the man on the grassy knoll was none other than Joe DeMaggio."

","When Oliver Stone sat down to write and direct this picture, given that 95% of the data contained within was available in numerous books since the '60s and '70s, he must have expected the typically dismissive reaction those paperback treatises had largely received.<br/><br/>Instead, all Hell broke loose.<br/><br/>Not since the jaw-droppingly racist epic THE BIRTH OF A NATION seventy-six years earlier had a movie received such a startlingly prickly response or would become such a controversy.<br/><br/>Based rather loosely on New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison's prosecution of local businessman Clay Shaw regarding Shaw's alleged complicity in setting up Lee Harvey Oswald in the 1963 JFK assassination (""loosely"" because the investigation and trial is used as a format for presenting data uncovered in some cases by other investigators and at a later date) the picture is a mesmerizingly rich montage of fact and educated theory, Stone's quick-cuts editing style then highly unusual (though now used incessantly in movies about absolutely nothing) and evocative. He does an impressive job of communicating a massive amount of information to the audience in only about three hours. But it's exactly Stone's cinematic skill which caused ""JFK"" to explode into reviled critical consciousness in a manner all those assassination books never would, could or did.<br/><br/>Any honest student of the assassination won't be stunned by the content. But the media and governmental over-reactive upsurge against the movie was almost more damning that the movie itself.<br/><br/>Even today, nearly two decades after the film was released, it's astounding how infamous it remains. Also astounding is how the LoneNut/Oswald-did-it mindset continues to hold on. If one checks out the numerous assassination Internet websites, for example, they are nearly all stalwart defenders of the Warren Commission, some surfacely affecting objectivity, some rabidly direct --- they are essentially the cyber version of Gerald Posner's 1993 ""Case Closed"", once called ""the most dishonest book ever written"" and a literary response to Stone's movie. ""Case Closed"" (and those websites) clearly know the data: they go into great, intricate detail in an effort to meticulously deconstruct all of the pro-conspiracy material.... only they deconstruct falsely. As anyone who knows the material will quickly realize. But, to the uninitiated, such sites' endless, 24/7 ""debunking"" (a favorite phrase by the fervent and on-message-beyond-belief LoneNut bloggers who haunt the Internet) of the conspiracy can appear quite convincing, just as these more casual audiences are so easily fooled by the authoritative yet selectively sloppy Untruths of Peter Jennings' 40th Anniversary Special for ABC in 2003 or (that other Stone's) ""Oswald's Ghost."" The eternal rationalizations, the endless manipulations from the pro-Warren Commission crowd. The unending assertions of, ""Oh, I use to be a conspiracy believer, too, until I learned that.... ,"" and the ubiquitous world-weary faux tones of, ""Let's just finally get this behind us, people. If you would read the superb and painstaking investigation by ...... then, you would know that this was all concretely disproved years ago when....."" On and on and on.<br/><br/>Apparently, the only massive conspiracy this seething, vitriolic army of LoneNutters finds credible is that countless otherwise unconnected witnesses --- even those first-hand witnesses from Dealey Plaza! --- all somehow colluded in their shameless efforts to clear Oswald, frame the CIA, or just to frame faceless gunman in the trees behind the picket fence. All for money or attention or to achieve some other unspecified spineless agendum.<br/><br/>At this late date, however, with nearly all of the conspirators presumably long gone (and ~75% of the American public still convinced of the conspiracy, as they have been since the '60s) why is maintaining The Lie so important in some corners? As clearly it is. It has, after all, been nearly half a century since Kennedy died on the streets of Dallas.<br/><br/>Perhaps because the dynamic behind the assassination of the 35th president (or the dynamic behind misrepresenting it) is still essentially in place. 'The Secret State' is an awfully mysterious phrase, but it simply reflects large corporate business interests and those interests' determined defense of their rights to circumvent our democratic processes at every possible turn... Up until the recent near-Depressional economic downturn, the national news media (generally in bed with the same corporations) wouldn't even fleetingly address arguably the most pressing issue of our time: corporate corruption and Big Business's stranglehold on all levels of our government. And even now, such coverage is superficial and grudging at best.<br/><br/>So when famed Watergate burglar E Howard Hunt's 2004 handwritten and audio-taped confession of personal and CIA/LBJ involvement in JFK's murder can't even receive coverage in the national media decades after the event, where are we still? It seems there is no pro-conspiracy revelation, no matter how dramatic and credible, which can receive coverage. And no anti-conspiracy evidence, no matter how flimsy and contrived, which can't.<br/><br/>Many detractors have sneered that it's dreadful that millions of youngsters perceive the JFK assassination thru the ""distorted lens"" of Oliver Stone. But I say, ""Thank goodness for Oliver."""
"dougdoepke","Null","2","9","26 March 2013"," A Brief Reminder
","Regardless of the politics, this is a powerful movie. The acting is first-rate, along with production values that insist on actual locales where possible. Three hours is a burden on the rear end no matter how good the film, but this one manages to hold attention throughout. The Kennedy assassination continues to fascinate, I think, because of the many threads running through it that point in several different directions.<br/><br/>The movie itself makes a strong case for a government-led conspiracy. A brief review, however, is hardly the place to argue the merits of Garrison's case or conspiracy in general. Nonetheless, the movie succeeds in bringing to popular attention a number of holes in the Warren Commission's lone assassin theory. <br/><br/>Crucially, however, it's well to keep in mind that filmmaking is an art and by its nature art deals with images. Now, images can be a reflection of reality, and in that sense function as an expression of truth. But imagery, of course, is not reality itself. As a result, art as a source of truth about the world, has an inbuilt limitation.<br/><br/>I mention this caveat only as a general caution about movies in general, and not to discredit this film in particular. All in all, I think the movie represents pretty powerfully many of the key facts of key eyewitnesses involved in the most intriguing murder case of the century. Thus, the film should not be missed, whatever one's persuasion."

","It is important this film was made, in spite of the huge uproar it caused, the claims of propaganda. It's safe to assume that Stone expected this to function as a valve that would give voice to decades of pent-up frustration with an inept, at worst shady, bureaucracy and government, even a half-paranoid, jagged voice.<br/><br/>But important just the same, first because it taps into a national narrative a part of which you have privately seen unfold, possibly puzzled over the many implications and what your own level of involvement should be, but more in how it suggests that even such a massive narrative seen from so many ends is actually being engineered somewhere, which is a fundamental asset of film noir. We all live in a noir world, small and tossed about by forces beyond comprehension or so abstract as to be completely removed from reality. The idea is that somewhere must be locked away a set of answers that explain this hidden fabric of things, ideally a list of names.<br/><br/>Of course if this conspiracy is true that is devastating for obvious reasons. And if it's not we should feel at least anger about the secrecy, omission and just plain ineptitude involved.<br/><br/>But the point is one way or the other, we do live in that noirish world as we understand it to work and have been co-conspirators in the enigmatic fabrication. We have poked holes in the fabric of things. The damage is irreversible and starts here for the generation that is still responsible for a lot of our storytelling.<br/><br/>This is the gist of the film, the effort to assemble truth from disjointed life creating disjointed truths that further disjoint life. It's purely a Wellesian construct adopted from Kane but even more visual at this point. All sorts of movies unravel at every intersection. Some are testimonies, others memories, still others reports and counter-reports. Photos are animated for us. Zapruder's film. Stone's re-enactment of it but as actual footage. TV screens playing bits that we need to see.<br/><br/>And all that conflated and re-assembled into a trial. Stone's lofty intention is that this would be the trial that never happened, with us in the role of jury. But of course only some of what we've seen can be true at any given time, so at least some of what we've experienced as real from our end is not. Part of the film is lying.<br/><br/>This is a powerful conception that I don't think Stone ever came close to again. It aligns every small individual search for meaning in images with a massive effort to understand collective soul.<br/><br/>It makes a lot of sense that Stone appropriates visual grammar to express this from the enemy side of Eisenstein and Soviet montage. Those were always about a struggle and present action, never a thought. Stone presumes to inherit the agitprop experiment. We are meant to leave the trial animated to take action, probe and question.<br/><br/>But he falters at the last moment with his cloying courtroom sermon. It is evident here that Stone believes himself to be another Jim Garrison fighting to unveil evil. He feels so strongly about the subject matter, so emotionally, the maker slips out among the film. The spell is broken. We get to note that it was all put together solely for our verdict."

","Two aspects of this movie earn respect as cinema: the first is the way Stone manages stock footage - this is masterfully edited and composed. The second is the way it is structured around memories. The entire movie hinges on how Stone imagines his Garrison imagining the recollections of all his 'witnesses' (really just an amalgam of all the conspiracy buffs' theories). At key points, the stock footage and the cinematic 'memories' are sequenced together, producing a ""Citizen Kane"" effect. And so I rank this on the 'watchable' end of my rating scale.<br/><br/>Stone stated in interviews that his goal was to assemble all of the major conspiracy theories into one movie -- and the result is this elephantine mess, as corpulent as Candy's hipster lawyer. The smart thing to do would have been to focus on one character - Oswald, for example. Oldman handled him especially well - and use the visual storytelling described above to flesh that out...too bad.<br/><br/>It didn't take long for this to be relegated to mere entertainment. Only the most hardened conspiracy nut takes this at face value. I won't go through a list of points that I can refute (yawn). But I can advise you to watch ""Unsolved History: JFK - Beyond The Magic Bullet"". You may find this useful as an empirical debunking of the 'magic bullet' business that props up this movie and the theories that surround the most studied assassination in history.<br/><br/>So what else 'keeps this story from going away'? Mostly, I think it's the war baby and boomer generations' wounded pride -- they can't accept that the Kennedy lion could have been killed by a gnat. I know this is one of Stone's motivating factors.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is the same guy who slobbers all over that murderous despot Castro. Stone's narrative is the same in every movie -- 'regular' Americans love their country, but it's been hijacked by business greedheads and fascists. <br/><br/>It's sad. Sad because so many people take this seriously, in order to fill their emptiness. I had the bilious displeasure of watching ""Loose Change 2nd Ed."", a sign of yet another brewing cultural war. I'm afraid that within three decades we'll be seeing narrative movies by A-list directors about Sept. 11, 2001 that demand responses to 'unanswered questions'.<br/><br/>On the lighter side, this was nicely deflated in Seinfeld's ""The Boyfriend (1)"" episode.

Kennedy may very well have been one of this country's greatest presidents, but as Donald Sutherland's character states, ""all of that vanished on that day back in 1963.""<br/><br/>Oliver Stone is undoubtedly one of the bravest filmakers of the last 25 years and seemed to have reached the height of his controversy with 1991's ""JFK"".  As you know, the story basically follows New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's (Kevin Costner in an Oscar-worthy performance) investigation into the Kennedy assassination.  He risked his life and his career in pursuit of one thing: the truth.  With that said, why is the government so keen to keep the public from viewing records that could possibly offer some insight to the assassination?  <br/><br/>I have never read any of the books that inspired ""JFK"" (though I plan to soon), but the Abraham Zapruder film should be enough to prove to any free-thinking person that Lee Harvey Oswald COULD NOT have done the shooting.  The physics of the ""Magic Bullet Theory"" should also put a lot of doubt into the Warren Commission's claim of a lone assassin. <br/><br/>
Oliver Stone is one of today's truly great filmakers and I respect his views (mostly) but this one hits the nail on the head."

It nicely depicts the massive flaw in the official story and explains that questionable point and provided the alternative explanation that fits the thirsty mind. What's better is that the movie nicely sets a warning to the date when the secret should be shed clear. The acting overall is a nice one. Kevin Costner didn't overdo his parts, nicely controlling his character's emotions. Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman and Michael Rokker nicely gave lives to their characters."
"fteago","10","2","10","20 July 2014"," Best politically loaded movie ever made.
","Best politically loaded movie ever made. Oliver Stone is one of my favorite movie producers of all time (in company with Stanley Kubrick). As a master piece of cinematography this movie JFK is on a par with Natural born killers, of course its a completely different movie... but there are parallels: political contexts, the role of the media, violence etc. As Natural borne killers is a film about individuals doing murder, by serial killings, JFK is mainly about political murder. The film is mainly based on Jim Garrisons book ""On the trail of the assassins"". I have read this book √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú and its a great book in its tantalizing plot. I can not say that either the book or the film is what happened in Dallas ergo the killing of president Kennedy, what I can say is that the film is a great adaptation of a book that was being accused of being a insane mans egotistical search for notoriety. Hollywood changed this claim in a big way and gave Jim Garrison the pat on the back that this former DA deserves. Whatever the truth may be, Garrison did his job, by this I mean he did his job, like all civil servants ought to do, with total disregard for personal benefit, in search for the truth, over and beyond his professions stated responsibility. The film has some some very deep implications about power and the almighty's control of the media, and this subject should be discussed all he more since the medias roll in world politics is ever greater in steering opinions, morals and the way we think about history If you haven't seen this movie you ought to, and if you have seen it read Garrisons book."

A few people told me that they did not like this movie because it wasn't historically accurate but I personally do not care if a history movie is accurate or not I just care if it is good or bad.

","Oliver Stone went way out to deliver a brilliant condemnation on the Warren Commission's study of the assassination of President Kennedy. Stone left nothing to chance in this 1991 film where conspiracy seems to be the focal point in just about everything regarding this grim part of American history.<br/><br/>The acting is magnificent, whether it is from Kevin Costner as New Orleans Attorney Jim Garrison, who seems to uncover just about everything for his search for the truth in this matter.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci is absolutely amazing as a person up to his neck in involvement in the killing.<br/><br/>The court scenes are compelling and Stone takes no hostages with his theory that the assassination went way beyond Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby."
"francis-hogan","8","2","10","18 January 2014"," Brilliant film but dishonest account.
","A technically brilliant and exciting film but an utterly dishonest account. Pure fantasy. In an outrageous example of hypocrisy, the credits at the conclusion of the film challenge the young to pursue the truth. Oliver Stone should lead by example. The film boasts mind-blowing editing (especially for its time); wonderful acting, efficient directing, eerie pulsating music and an intensely thrilling plot line to easily overshadow all those paranoia movies of the 1970's - but as an implicitly declared historical document, the film is at best misleading and at worst delusional. To offer no disclaimer that the film is essentially fictional is akin to deceiving the viewing public, flirting dangerously close to libel, distorting history and exploiting a tragic event for commercial gain. The inclusion of a known historic event (albeit tragic) in an openly acknowledged work of fiction allows some potential for entertainment and perhaps even enlightenment - thereby protecting the work from being merely exploitative. If the work however pretends to be something it is not, then the inclusion of a known historic event in its narrative may justifiably cause offence. I confess I enjoyed the film enormously but the pleasure is a guilty one. I'd feel a whole lot easier about that pleasure if the film had simply acknowledged its fictitious essence and refrained from masquerading as a document of truth. Two stars lost for its deceit. The eight stars remain for its artistic merit."
"Leofwine_draca","6","2","10","22 November 2013"," A real labour of love
","It's always enjoyable to watch a writer/director undertaking a real labour of love, and it's clear that the subject of the JFK assassination is a real obsession of Oliver Stone's. His resultant film, which sometimes feels very artificial somehow, is basically an excuse for him to fit together every conspiracy theory and idea surrounding the shooting and put them into one unwieldy, ultra-lengthy movie.<br/><br/>JFK is a film that works on details and there are plenty of them here, most coming in during a couple of bum-numbing monologues by Kevin Costner and Donald Sutherland. None of it is particularly cinematic, and you wonder if a documentary might have got Stone's points across in a more sensible way, but somehow it all works and gels together. Costner has never been better than when he plays it straight, and his obsessive investigator brings to mind Jake Gyllenhaal's equally obsessed reporter in another true story, ZODIAC.<br/><br/>One thing that I found rather amusing is Stone's casting of famous faces in small roles, some of them blink-and-you'll-miss-'em. Gary Oldman is barely here, and there are even briefer turns from the likes of Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, and Kevin Bacon. Michael Rooker and Tommy Lee Jones both have meatier roles before they became familiar faces, both are cast against type and both are effective with it."
"johncornwell75","10","2","10","9 August 2013"," Fundamentally People are Suckers for the Truth
","Conspiracy or no, whatever your opinion, it doesn't matter because JFK is one of the finest films in years. The acting is sheer brilliance delivering long chunks of dialogue from the amazing script and yet making it all seem natural. Kevin Costner is great along with the rest of the impressive cast who fit into the strange world full of secrets and plots with ease. JFK is by no means a documentary but neither is it a complete work of fiction and it takes full advantage of this by constantly making you wonder where the lies end and the truth begins. Weaving fact, fiction, and every theory connected to the incident however strange or unbelievable into one stellar piece of cinematography Oliver Stone delivers a true classic."
"sahamh","10","2","10","4 July 2013"," An Excellent Movie for Every Generation
","This great film is directed by Oliver Stone and written by himself and Zachary Sklar . I know it's a little strange on 4th of July to watch this film about the corruption of the government, but this is a must see for any generation.<br/><br/>This is absolutely a legit film, it's 3 hours long, but I never can get my eyes off of it. It's so well-directed, from the intro to the finale, just perfect. It starts with introducing John F Kennedy and the events that has happened up to the day he's getting shot, like Argo that gives a summary of the Persian history, then killing of the president and its investigation by Jim Garrison and his team, which it all leads up to revealing big controversy theories about the president's death . Oliver Stone has done such a wonderful job here; it's so obvious how much efforts he has put to tell this story accurately and truthfully. The chaos among the people, the chaos at the shooting scene, recreating the shooting scene, the flashbacks, all these are being shown so perfectly and the evidence of his hard work - I was reading that they spent $70,000 at that time just to recreate the JFK's office precisely, which only has 8seconds in the whole movie. Another great aspect of the film is whenever there's flashbacks to the shooting day, the flashbacks aren't repetitive footages, and flashbacks of the other characters are believable, in my opinion it comes from the great cast who all bring great performances, the cinematography, the editing, and even the dark dramatic soundtrack, when these flashback come on the screen, you feel being there. The screenplay has great, strong dialogues, in fact this film is filled with a lot of dialogues and narration, but these are interesting dialogues that you don't want to miss, a lot of information and materials are being exchanged among characters, and I mean a lot. I seriously don't need to mention anything about the cast, the list says it all and none of them disappoints. I should mention that Kevin Costner has such a critical role here because you need to be convinced he's doing all these investigation for his country and future generation, and I'm not a big fan of his, but he seriously has nailed it here, I really like his performance here when his character is facing the frustration and difficulties and risking everything to reveal the truth to everyone.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite films of all time, I give it 10/10, and happy 4th of July."
"AudioFileZ","9","2","10","29 November 2012"," One Man's Search For Truth Against Overwhelming Power
","It's late 2012 and with that there is a certain kind of luxury one has when reviewing a film that when released seemed largely sensational, perhaps even an extreme weaving of more fiction than fact.<br/><br/>As the years passed from 1963 to this depiction of Clay Shaw's trial (in 1969) it still was an accepted fact that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assailant of President John F. Kennedy, thus the hard-to-swallow claim the accused was part of a larger conspiracy birthed in the blackest operations of the U.S. government by certain benefactors. However, by the late eighties their was a definite turn of the tide with a large number of Americans finding the ""lone assassin"" with the ""magic bullet"" theory patently ludicrous. Enter Oliver Stone, a man impassioned by another man's lone crusade for the truth regarding one of America's darkest hours (The Civil War being the darkest and this being next along with 911). This picture was a tremendous gamble which shows the director's own brand of courageous patriotism.<br/><br/>The above said, this is a film first about Jim Garrison, the fearless D.A. of New Orleans Louisiana. Garrison was to possessed to the point of obsession which cost him dearly personally. He ended up almost wrecking his family life for years and even depleting his own personal savings in his single-minded pursuit for justice to be served in what he believed was the highest act of treason: the conspiracy to kill J.F.K.. Stone goes about giving us Jim Garrison in a very realistic, if sympathetic way. One can not fault this because now, over 40-years removed from Garrison's prosecution of Clay Shaw, the mountain of known evidence is more vindicating related to Garrison than ever. It will likely continue to be more so even as those directly involved are largely deceased.<br/><br/>The story of Jim Garrison is fascinating. Garrison had the back-bone to do what no one else either would or could. Kevin Costner gives a superlative performance all-around in his depiction of an lowly local elected official attempting to take on the world's greatest concentration of power. It is only due to his extremely high-profile that he likely survived and the danger of his possible assassination builds throughout the film as M.L.K. and R.F.K. are also murdered. Stone has reverence for the quest and takes it seriously. Though the movie is long, and some would say slow, I find it fastidious in detail and never boring. In other words it is truly moving that a man ""without a dog in the hunt"" would hang himself so far over the line in his quest for the unthinkable. The viewer both roots for Garrison and cringes at how he is kept from securing valuable documents as well as many witnesses (like the obviously knowledgeable ""Mr. X""). One must feel pain for Garrison as even the trial's supposedly neutral judge is openly hostile (what a waste of humanity whoever this low-life of an empowered official was in real life).<br/><br/>This movie is exactly what President Eisenhower warned Americans of so take it that way and do a comprehensive research of your own. You will end up validating so much of what the movie presents that you will be much more open to the larger picture of what both Garrison and Stone extrapolated. No, it may not be 100 accurate, but if it isn't the errors are forgivable with obstruction at the highest level preventing a clearer picture. That is the power of this movie because it literally forces the viewer to think and pushes one toward more investigation (it actually did force the government to release a quantity of previously sequestered, yet still highly vetted, information as well as calling out the Warren Commission Report as fiction). It is a wake-up call because we still are largely victims of government by the few in this post 911 world.<br/><br/>I applaud Oliver Stone for bringing Jim Garrison's story so effectively to the masses. I am glad that not only was it surprisingly successful upon release, but that it has continued to be seen by millions more each year some twenty plus years later. Two things should be mandatory for all U.S. citizens: read The Constitution and see this movie, 'nuff said!"

","The murder of President John F. Kennedy on November 22nd. 1963 was perhaps the greatest tragedy to have visited the United States of America. The question was asked of young and old alike, 'Where were you when you heard, They Just Shot President Kennedy?' There are many theories concerning the assassination of so beloved a popular president, but none that has truly satisfied the listening public. In this film called "" J. F. K "" director Oliver Stone attempts to explain the reason for Kennedy's death and the cover up which followed. With the use of great actors such as Kevin Costner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Mathau, Ed Asner, Joe Pesi, Tommy Lee Jones and a dozen others, Stone's monumental task is seen for what it is, A Classic Work of Art. It's true, the American public will never uncover the truth behind the actual killing, but this film does allow for a better understanding of who might have profited from the great man's death. Audiences across the nation are given the hidden agenda and the men responsible for their cowardly deed. This three hour movie explains in meticulous detail of how the assassination was carried out and how The Warren Report botched the investigation. There are many reasons why we will never know, but one thing remains true, those presidents who are not as popular or loved by the public as President Kennedy, need never fear the magic bullet. This movie becomes part of our history and a living legacy towards a final tribute to John F. Kennedy."
"sol1218","8","2","10","3 May 2012"," Fundamentally people are suckers for the truth and the truth is on your side Bubba!
","Director Oliver Stone gives the JFK assassination the royal treatment, over three hours worth of running time,in his blockbuster 1991 shocker of a movie ""JFK"" in it getting to the bottom to who in fact not only shot the president but who was both behind and planned the assassination and cover up that followed it. It was of all things the Clay Shaw, Tommy Lee Jones, trial that Stone used in his movie ""JFK"" to totally disprove the by now in the garbage can, in that almost no one believes it anymore, Warren Commission Report on the assassination. In that the Clay Shaw trial was the first and only trial that involved the JFK assassination with Shaw, a successful New Orleanes businessman,being charged with being, a planner not shooter, behind it.<br/><br/>The movie succeeds in disproving the Warren Commission but falls somewhat flat on its face in trying to connect a number of US Government agencies, like the CIA, the Mafia anti-Castro Cubans as well as Vice President Johnson as being somehow behind JFK's assassination. It was like Stone trowing a plate of spaghetti on the wall and see what would stick. Still Stone does a masterful job in waking the public up to the discrepancies as well as out right lies that they've been fed over the years by major members of the US media that Lee Harvey Oswald, Gary Oldman, was the lone nut assassin or the assassin at all. It's three years after JFK was killed that New Orleans D.A Jim Garrison, Kevin Costner, decided to reopen the case in that Oswald originally was in the city, as a Marxist Communist activist, the summer before JFK was murdered. Oswald was also closely associated with a number of people who wanted President Kennedy dead and made no bone in hiding their dislike of him.<br/><br/>As Garrison uncovers evidence that shows Oswlald was not what the media as well as the FBI and Warren Commission made him out to be key witnesses to what happened that fateful afternoon in Dallas Texas, November 22 1963, start to either clam up disappeared or meet an unexpected end in life. One of them is the wacko David Ferrie, Joe Pesci, who was in the same US civil air patrol unit with Oswald back in the mid 1950's when Oswald was still in his teens. Ferrie made an unexpected trip to Dallas to go duck hunting with a number of his friends the day that JFK was shot and left the very same evening! Was it to shoot JFK not ducks that Ferrie & Co were really interested in? It was through Ferrie as well as convicted male hooker Willie O'Keefe, Kevin Bacon, that eventually lead to Shaw in his being suspected of having foreknowledge to the JFK assassination. In that all three, Ferrie O'Keefe & Shaw, had a mutual acquaintance with non other then Lee Harvey Oswald! JFK's convicted in absentia assassin, since he was deceased and couldn't defend himself, by the Warren Commission!<br/><br/>As interesting as the movie is it's the last 15 or 20 minutes that really hit home and make an impression on the audience when D.A Jim Garrison makes his final summation to the jury. It's then that all the BS half truths lies shyster talk and inconsistencies in what happened on November 22, 1963 becomes apparent to those of us watching the film as well as those in the courtroom. Even though Garrison doesn't end up convicting Clay Shaw in his part in the JFK assassination he does in fact prove that we've, the American public, had been had or conned into believing what the US Government and Warren Commission told us the truth about the ""facts"" in the JFK assassination without as much as bothering to check any of the facts or evidence out! Which in fact D.A Jim Garrison not only did but in his Don Quixote like determination attempted to, against overwhelming odds,and proved to the jury! Who despite finding Shaw innocent agreed that a conspiracy was involved in the assassination of JFK. <br/><br/>P.S It was ironic as well as a stroke of genius for Stone to cast the real Jim Garrison in the film as non other as Chief Justice Earl Warren who comes across as if he's either brain dead or suffering from the advance stages of Alzhimer Disease in his robotic and zombie like performance. It was Warren and his Warren Commission that Jim Garrison was out to prove was either totally inept or criminally irresponsible in covering up the true facts behind the JFK assassination!"
"tankyvaughn","10","2","10","21 December 2011"," Must see for anyone who is interested in the JFK assassination
","I have been interested in the JFK assassination for over 10 years, but after seeing Oliver Stone's movie I found myself needing to do as much research into what happened as I could. Reading books, researching online and even visiting Dealey Plaza. Even before seeing the movie my thoughts were that no man could've made 3 perfect shots from the TBD in such little time with a piece of crap Mannlicher Carcano, a rifle which has since been slated for being an almost unworkable piece of junk.<br/><br/>Stone's movie is thought provoking, tense, and dramatic. Filled with a star studded cast like Costner (who gives his best ever performance as Garrison), Sutherland, Pesci, Lee-Jones, Oldman it flows seamlessly, add to that a brilliant score by John Williams who is a master at film scores. The courtroom scene is probably my favourite part of any movie I've seen, a brilliant speech by Costner who nailed this part down to a T. None of his previous performances have topped this one<br/><br/>Now I wont say everything in the film is 100% accurate, but the bits that are accurate make you think hard about what really happened in Dealey Plaza that day. I was already a believer that the Warren Commission was a whitewash full of inconsistencies, this film and the book ""Crossfire"" by Jim Marrs confirmed it for me. And the single bullet theory sold by Mr Spector was so hard to swallow, that one single bullet could pass through 2 peoples bodies and change direction many times, was quite frankly laughable. There was a conspiracy, its just who was involved and how many were in on it is the big question.<br/><br/>Was it the Mafia?? The CIA? Anti-Castro Cubans? The Russians?? Do yourself a favour after seeing this film, research as much as you can and you may find the answer you are looking for. I have my own theory as to what really happened but that would take up pages and pages of words so I shall leave it there.<br/><br/>Suffice to say JFK is a must see for anyone who's interested in the assassination. My only gripe was that it was a bit long to watch in one sitting, its a film you have to watch 2 or 3 times so you can absorb all the info it gives you. Top marks Mr Stone, keep fighting the fight Oliver!"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","2","11","2 August 2010"," If you love conspiracy and historical fiction, ""JFK"" is unbeatable
","The most famous conspiracy of all time gets the big-screen treatment and boy, what a treatment it is. Famed and controversial filmmaker Oliver Stone appeared to be in way over his head with ""JFK,"" pouring what probably amounts to decades of investigation and research into three-plus hours of screen time, enough to convince even the most stringent of government sympathizers that Lee Harvey Oswald could not have possibly assassinated President John F. Kennedy.<br/><br/>Even if you're not a fan of historical conspiracy, if you appreciate film you'll be blown away by the technical precision of Stone's effort. The conspiracy itself does guide much of the film's run time (that's not to detract from its powerful ideological arguments between characters), so it can be weighty for those who don't enjoy the learning aspect. However, the masterful blend of contemporary scenes and archive footage give ""JFK"" an unparalleled documentary-like feel.<br/><br/>The use of various cameras, lenses and film stock makes a lot of the film's footage appear to be archive footage, so naturally it's hard to distinguish fact from fiction, but the result is more fascinating than confusing. Whole sections of the film belong to two monologues: Jim Garrison's (Kevin Costner) closing argument to the jury at the film's end and the mysterious source ""X"" (Donald Sutherland) explaining to Garrison how the Department of Defense, FBI and CIA all could have collaborated to carry out the assassination. Without mixing in compelling visuals, these scenes would consist only of talking heads. Not only do these visuals work, but they also make sense. It's no wonder cinematography and editing were the two victories ""JFK"" scored at the Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Although Stone's focus is the material itself, the characters are still compelling. The story centers around New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who three years after the assassination has an epiphany and opens the first investigation of the president's murder, finding it impossible to believe that Oswald (Gary Oldman) alone could have fired three shots from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository and been successful.<br/><br/>The film delves a bit into Garrison's family life, which shows how his ""obsession"" with the case has hurt his family and upset his wife. Sounds pretty typical, but the writing from Stone and Zachary Sklar creates such deep empathy that you understand exactly where each character comes from. The same happens in the other dramatic scenes between Garrison and the people he questions or Garrison and members of his investigative team that begin to question the whole thing. Costner is downright believable and you're with him and behind him every step of the way.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is flooring. There are a number of cameos and small parts filmed by huge names. There's everyone from the tandem of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (not together however) to Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon and Sissy Spacek to John Candy. When you watch a film that has so many excellent faces appear for brief minutes, you get the sense that the film is important. Any script that draws in that many names must be special and ""JFK"" is. <br/><br/>The film occasionally loses itself in all the conspiracy exposition, but anyone who finds it interesting will discover the seemingly insurmountable run time much easier to handle than expected. The choice, however, makes ""JFK"" a non-traditional film. It's a unique breed of historical fiction, a textbook in story form. But to top it all off, it speaks profoundly about themes regarding people and their government, the fear-power dynamic and of course fighting for the fundamental right to truth.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

In 2038 the national archives have to open the files of the JFK Assassination but until then the U.S.A has to be ready to discover the truth because if it is not, we even might never see those important proofs; they will go missing.<br/><br/>I admire Oliver Stone for his commitment to produce a film about what still is a ""conspiracy"". Doubting the official story with solid counter facts is the best wake up call to the people of the world, to stop thinking about our Governments as Guardians of social values, democracy and liberty. They are not, and realizing that fact is shocking and hard to believe, harder to prove.<br/><br/>I want somebody to produce a decent movie about 9/11, not in Michael Moore style, but in Oliver Stone JFK style, and if it has to be in the year 2039, so 20 years after the actual incident (JFK is released 28 Years after the events of the Kennedy Assassination). Someone has to dare.<br/><br/>Too bad it can't be Oliver Stone again, who has already made his early statement with his apparently neutral, but not so neutral ""WTC"" movie, which did not question any of the 9/11 facts. Watch ""Loose change SE"" for a start if you're interested in what the U.S Government is capable of. It will shock you just like this movie might have shocked you, too.<br/><br/>P.S. From a cinematic and rhetorical point of view this movie is very very enjoyable, really sucks you in, that's what I personally love about it.<br/><br/>P.P.S Many people do not agree with my opinion, review, which again proves that this topic is still up-to-date and debatable."
"HalGuentert","10","2","12","15 October 2008"," JFK: A Must See Film, Rare 10 out of 10, and Want to See More Like It
","""JFK"" is Oliver Stone at his best.<br/><br/>It is one of the few docudramas I could watch again and again, and find something new and interesting. It covers a single tragedy effecting the United States that is only surpassed by the events on 9/11/2001. I am surprised when this movie is compared to ""Nixon"", because this movie is far and away superior to Mr. Stone's ""Nixon"" in every area.<br/><br/>I was only a fifth grader when this event took place, but became more interested as I learned about the lack of integrity in government and the media in reporting history, as well as, the plans JFK had to reform the corruption in the ""intelligence"" agencies, while restoring integrity to the United States in many areas. I may not agree with JFK's view of the United Nations, but find I do agree or at least understand his decision making based on what was known at the time, and believe his decisions were made in the best interest of the citizens as opposed to the crony capitalists who replaced him, and created our current morally and financially bankrupt state run by banks and global elitists.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, studying the JFK assassination beyond this movie leads you down an unending ""rabbit hole"" of new evidence that confirms a conspiracy, but never provides a clear picture of everything that happened regarding the actual assassination details. There are numerous possibilities for sniper sites, exotic technical details, and unexplained significant details. This makes focusing on the only trial of the assassination conspirators pure genius.<br/><br/>The story's focus is on Jim Garrison, New Orleans District Attorney, and his legitimate concern and investigation of the assassination conspirators who had recently resided in New Orleans. It also shows that he completely underestimated the power and resources of those opposing his investigation.<br/><br/>He first believes that the Warren Commission and FBI will do an adequate job of investigating the assassination, but finds that the results were either a cover-up or completely incompetent. He begins his investigation three years late due to his trust in the federal agencies based on his experience as a former FBI agent and military officer. He also tries to maintain a low profile until the investigation is completed, and does not question Jack Ruby (Rubinstein) before Ruby takes his information to the grave.<br/><br/>It is a story of a heroic effort to find and face the truth, and to prosecute the guilty while being undermined at every step by the media and federal government. Once Mr. Garrison questions Clay Shaw and finds that he is also ""Clay Bertrand"", both elimination of witnesses and a multi-media campaign kick off to derail his investigation and case against Clay Shaw (the only local conspirator left alive).<br/><br/>Jim Garrison received little cooperation from the feds, but was able to obtain a near original version of the Zapruder film from Time-Life, and present a case that exposed a conspiracy, even if he could not convict Clay Shaw. Shaw was dead by 1974. One point that was not covered was why the Texas Attorney General or Dallas District Attorney had not done a better job of investigating the assassinations of JFK and Oswald. It is now known that Shaw was a OSI and CIA operative and that the Zapruder film has been altered within a few days of being purchased by Time-Life, a CIA contractor. It is also interesting to note that there is no evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald even touched any rifle on Nov. 22, 1963, so explaining how he was even suspected for the assassination and who provided the police a description are still a mysteries.<br/><br/>Although the movie does not cover all the reasons that President Kennedy was gunned down, it does present most related to his clash with the CIA and the military industrial complex. It also presents a clearer picture of what actually is known about what happened at Dealey Plaza in Dallas including the crowd reaction toward the fence on the ""grassy knoll"", and the complete removal of all the usual and expected protection by the Secret Service and the undercover military units that would have reduced the chance of assassination by rifle shot to near zero.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie resulted in more records being released and declassified is a tribute to the impact of this ""must see"" project. The DVD extras are also valuable presentations."

","Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" is an amazing accomplishment in every sense.  The cast, led by Kevin Costner and the Oscar-nominated Tommy Lee Jones is second-to-none, and Stone's direction is just as powerful as his previous work in ""Platoon"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July"".  The film deals with Stone's conspiracy theory that President Kennedy's assassination was part of a powerful cover-up that went through the highest places in our government. Is Stone's reasoning warranted?  I am not sure.  The JFK case has been a major mystery ever sense it occurred some 37 years ago.  Perhaps it was just a simple assassination by Lee Harvey Oswald, but the increasing speculation and paranoia makes even the most skeptical theorists stand up and take notice to this story.  ""JFK"", if nothing else, is one of those films that will make you think even if the thoughts are those of the film-maker.  5 stars out of 5."

You have John Larroquette(!)playing 'Jerry Johnson'(thinly disguised Carson send up), w/ the NBC brass essentially doing the same old Media rant-One Guy Did it! Shaddap-because We Say So! More or less. Very funny. Ya gotta like that really AWFUL Tonight Show set from '68 and the Ed McMahon stand in too. Fun stuff. <br/><br/>Other deleted scenes he puts in, a 50-50 mix of good, bad:<br/><br/>The whole 'Mob guys surrounding Costner in the John w/ the police's silent help' scene, w/ a panicked Bill Broussard in tow-doesn't quite fit. How much did Broussard know about this? You really don't quite see why if someone wanted to shoot at Garrison(a big 6-4 type guy) why they didn't just up and do so. This was odd. I didn't quite buy Broussard coming back and being remorseful about leaving the investigation either. Rooker is quite a good actor-here, it was his worst scene.<br/><br/>They show Sissy Spacek still living with Costner right before RFK is shot, in the orig. you don't see this at all-instead you see him coming home and making a sandwich in the kitchen, implying that she has moved out already. Interesting.<br/><br/>I liked the added dialogue in the 6th floor, discussing the parade route change, Cabell, Bissell, Dulles, etc. But Stone was right to yank it, as it's just one more layer of names, faces, events, connections piled ontop of an already tangled miasma of names already.<br/><br/>There was also the short Lou Grant/Jack Lemmon discussing the leaflets scene. That was funny but not terribly relevant.<br/><br/>I liked seeing the appearence of Tommy Lee and Oswald at the voter registration  rally. It does add to the litany of mutual appearences the two men made.<br/><br/>And did you like seeing Frank Whaley as the fake Oswald, running around w/ the car and talking about shooting JFK at the rife range?  Interesting to see young Moonlight Graham from 'Field of Dreams' turning up in another Costner film, albeit in a much different role.<br/><br/>Kudos for adding 'George Moehrenschmildt' too.

"karlito5","9","2","13","11 January 2007"," An excellent film and just that
","I'm from the UK and I first saw this film about six years ago. Initially I was struck by it's power to persuade, I finished watching it and felt convinced President Kennedy's death was the result of a massive plot involving everyone and anyone. This I think is a testament to the quality of the film and the way in which Oliver Stone throws a mountain of evidence up into the air and then with some of the best editing I've ever seen constructs a case implicating the US government, the Cubans, the Mafia and various others in a conspiracy. Even if you don't agree with Stone I think you still have to admire the way he presents his case.<br/><br/>Of course this was before I began to study US history in particular, the Civil Rights Movement from Lincoln to the 1980s and Cold War between 1945 and 1975. As you can probably guess I realised Stone hadn't been entirely honest in his historical interpretations in JFK. I went on to realise that the reasons Stone puts forward as to why Kennedy was shot were not entirely accurate.<br/><br/>Meanwhile before I saw JFK I knew very little of the various theories that abound about what happened on Dealey Plaza in November 1963. Since then though I've read quite a lot about the assassination although I'm by no means as knowledgeable as the residents of the message boards for this film. However although I'm now sceptical regarding of Stone's version of events I still have his film to thank for encouraging me to look deeper into the case and, as is stated by X in the film, to make my own conclusions.<br/><br/>Also, despite the fact that I reckon JFK probably wasn't the victim of a conspiracy, I still think that JFK works superbly as political thriller of epic proportions (and I just love the way Hollywood legends stroll in and out of small roles). What's more although events on Dealey Plaza may not have played out as described in JFK the film still manages to convince me that a scenario could play out in such a fashion.<br/><br/>Finally whatever you think about the death of Presindent Kennedy you really need to see JFK if only because it's three hours of simply breathtaking entertainment"

In this case, bias is what gives the story direction, which ultimately leads to the point of the view that the film expresses.<br/><br/>It is a long journey - nearly 3 and half hours - which is basically constant dialog, but the direction and editing make it riveting by actually showing what the characters are talking about.

If anything it was the music, the use of historical footage, and the big name actors that made this film what it is.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is really considered a spoiler or not, but an excellent example of how this film is pretty (factually) bogus is the scene where the lead proves it is impossible for the rifle to fire 3 shots in 6 seconds. What is funny about this, is that if timed, the movie shows it is entirely possible to fire all three shots Along with this how many witnesses say they saw smoke firing from a gun. If you've ever fired a rifle, you'd already see where this is going. Even the people making this film could not find a gun that could create as much smoke as displayed in the movie, so they had to create their own! Despite the misleading information, it is definitely a good film. A little long for my likings (Although, this is probably because it took us three days to watch it all due to interruptions, and that we watched ""Triumph of the Will"" the day before) As said before, watch this film with an open mind. I myself was convinced with the story until I learned how misleading it is.

I was impressed by Kevin Costners closing speech at the trial. Perhaps a bit too emotional for the European mind in a case like this, but then again - what American doesn't become emotional, when the credibility and integrity of their government is under question? And here comes the spoiler: Governor Connally, sitting right in front of president Kennedy in his car, cries out in the middle of the horrible fracas:""My God! They are going to kill us all!"" They? What circumstance made the good governor refer to the shooter/shooters in plural? I was surprised and disappointed to find that neither the Warren Commission nor Jim Garrison regarded the actions and statements of those in the motorcade worth while to investigate: to me it seems that at least a few of the individuals present knew what was going to happen, and where.

As for the politics, I think there's a lot to recommend it, especially if one applies the Discomfort Litmus Test, i.e., just note how many howls of outrage and dismissive splutterings were aimed at Stone and the movie. It touched a chord. ""JFK"" has been unfairly painted as a conspiracy nut's fantasy. But Stone was making a movie, not a documentary - although heaven knows there's enough material out there in real life to make Stone's movie seem pallid. I believe that Stone's purpose was to show how smoothly and competently an assassination of the president could be carried out by the powers that be, how they could simply view it as a necessary step in advancing their own interests, and how expendable any individual is in the scheme of power politics. Stone certainly used a lot of material that is fairly well vouched for, and if he fictionalized the meetings at the upper levels of government, he was really saying, ""This is how it could have happened. It may not have been the same people as I'm showing, but if not them, then others. If you look at the evidence, it could have been something like this."" Viewed through that lens, ""JFK"" is a provocative thriller that should be seen in a double feature with ""The Parallax View"", which also dissects the mechanics of conspiracy and presents it as ""business as usual"" for those who deal in that currency."

The book is based on the testimony of District Attorney Jim Garrison on the conspiracy theory surrounding the Kennedy assassination. It's a miracle this book was written at all if everything in it is true as there were government officials from the CIA to the FBI who would be more than happy to silence Mr. Garrison permanently. It's this aspect of Garrison's life that the film partly explores, as he struggles to build up a case against Clay Shaw whilst trying to raise a family and remain a dutiful husband, all the while dealing with attempts on his life and being slaughtered by the media.<br/><br/>Secondly, the film is interesting for the fact that it was released by a major Hollywood studio, as the material is not what you might call ""gentle"". This is a hardcore attack on the U.S. government, including, among others, ex-president Lyndon Johnson and the CIA. It's not the sort of thing a studio releases lightly, which is why I give credit to Warner Bros. for taking such a huge risk, and also to the actors who appeared in it.

"eckhouse24","10","2","13","30 March 2004"," JFK is a great masterpiece.
","In 1991, Oliver Stone directed a movie that would center around one of the biggest events in American History, the assignation of President John F. Kennedy. With this film, Stone brought up the question of was there a conspiracy. Through out the film, he lends us ideas about a conspiracy and who may be behind the conspiracy, but he never gives us an answer. Why? Probably because Oliver Stone himself doesn't know the answer. In fact, I feel he is not making this film to tell us who is behind the assignation but instead to show that there was indeed a conspiracy behind the assignation and the American public is not in on any of the facts behind the assignation. JFK is about Jim Garrison, a New Orleans District attorney played by Kevin Costner in one of his most outstanding roles, and his quest to prove the Warren Commission wrong. The film begins with a brief history of John F Kennedy from his election victory up until his assignation on November 22, 1963. From then on, we the viewers watch as Jim Garrison begins to unravel the events of that day and watch him and his team searching for proof that Lee Harvey Oswald was not a lone gunman.      The film is over 3 hours long and in its run Oliver Stone introduces us to many characters and fills us with tons of information. And while we are accepting all this information we are able to follow along without missing a step of Garrison's trail. In the final climax of the film we see Garrison take local respected businessman, Clay Shaw played by Tommy Lee Jones, to trial. Shaw had been linked to several of the people behind the `conspiracy' through various witnesses. Shaw denied ever being part of the CIA however, in 1979, 10 years after the trial, the CIA admitted that Shaw was apart of the CIA. Of course, this came 5 years after Shaw's death. From these facts we can believe that Garrison was on the right trail and that the assignation was indeed, a conspiracy. JFK does bring up some valid points and all though some of the history may have been twisted for the film, it all works because it doesn't take away any of the questions the film asks. Was There a Conspiracy? The biggest piece of evidence that questions the Warren Commissions decision that Oswald was the only assassin was the home movie from Abraham Zapruder. This home movie clearly questions the lone gunman theory as we can clearly see that Kennedy was shot in the head from a front angle which would negate that Oswald was the only assassin being that Oswald was behind Kennedy in the schoolbook depository. Back and to the left, back and to the left, back and to the left Garrison repeats in the courtroom painting a picture that shows that if there was more than one gunman than there has to be a conspiracy. The film also states that in 1979, the U.S. Senate select committee found that the Kennedy assignation was probably a conspiracy however as of 1991, there has never been an investigation.

","This film is extremely interesting. Although a recent television documentary has shown it to be all but correct, the picture presents a technically sound and believable side to the JFK story. Kevin Costner is very impressive as Jim Garrison, fighting for what he truly believes in an obsessive pursuit of the truth. Flashbacks dominate the film, which is very well shot with excellent use of camera angles. These effects make Garrison's story all the more believable. The highlight of the film is the final scene, what it has all been building up to, the very climax. Garrison is bringing a court case against the homosexual aristocrat Clay Shaw, and the viewer cannot forsee the verdict until the very end. A parable of our time."
"majikstl","8","2","13","27 February 2004"," ""Who grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald?""
","As a dazzling display of film-making skill, you'd be hard pressed to find anything quite as efficient as Oliver Stone's JFK. As a document of history, the film falls far short. Using an array of film-making tricks and techniques Stone has created a long but engrossing tale, juggling dozens of remarkable characters and intertwining multiple stories and theories. The regrettable part is that in the end -- like in reality -- you don't know who or what to believe, which would be fine if that was Stone's conclusion. But in mixing reality and fantasy, archival footage and new footage, together to make them indistinguishable, Stone aims at presenting a solution to this great American mystery. Even granting the need for dramatic license, the film has serious issues when it comes to integrity. Just as you can't be just a little bit pregnant, you can't add just a little bit of fiction into fact and claim historical truth.<br/><br/>The irony is that the very paranoia that fuels the film and inspired Stone to fully invest his talent is also the element that robs the film of credibility.<br/><br/>Though Stone hedges his bets a bit by framing much of the story as supposition and presents reenactments of events that may or may not have really happened, the final conclusion that the audience is left with is that President Kennedy was the victim of a vast conspiracy consisting of the CIA, the Mafia, Fidel Castro, LBJ, an oddball band of communist sympathizers and a few odds and ends homosexuals, whose motives are never made clear. Just about everybody is culpable, except possibly Lee Harvey Oswald. By the time Stone's protagonist, the discredited and otherwise long-forgotten New Orleans prosecutor, Jim Garrison, gets Clay Shaw, a gay New Orleans business man, to trial on charges of conspiracy, the film itself seems to have lost all reason. Only the momentum of Stone's storytelling justifies the otherwise inexplicable trail that leads to Shaw.<br/><br/>But, boy what storytelling it is. Cleverly using a cast of name actors -- a move that, no doubt, help get the film financed -- Stone gives identities to a huge collection of characters who might otherwise confuse the audience. This also gives credibility to his illusion of historical authenticity. Using the infamous Zapruder film as a centerpiece to his recreation of the assassination, the film takes on the air of a documentary.<br/><br/>But it isn't a documentary. Much of his depiction of ""facts"" is discredited theory, crackpot ideas and plain old everyday paranoia. For all of its brilliance, JFK never ties things together into a believable whole. One is apt to leave the film convinced of a conspiracy, but without any real evidence to back up the suspicions.<br/><br/>An added irritation provided by Stone's view is that President John Kennedy is ultimately trivialized by the entire enterprise. Despite the title, Kennedy is almost a nonentity in the film. Though Stone suggests that it was Kennedy's supposed intent to pull out of the war in Vietnam that was the motive for his assassination, that all seems like a wild guess on Stone's part rather than an accepted fact. And Kennedy himself, no matter what his worth was as a world leader, a charismatic politician, a pop icon, a family man or a human being, is reduced to being little more than a human target in Stone's little world. I think Kennedy deserves better."

","The film follows the only trial to date related to the Kennedy assassination. Clay Shaw stands accused of conspiracy by the New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison.<br/><br/>Whereas the Warren commission report put forward the case for the lone killer theory, the film, or trial to be more exact, puts forward the case for a conspiracy theory. Kevin Costner is excellent as Jim Garrison and is well supported by the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>I'm 100% certain that I'll never be 100% certain about the facts surrounding the JFK assassination. I don't agree with the ultimate conclusion of Jim Garrison, but other conspiracy theories and the lone gunman theory are also covered by the movie. It's upto each person to decide what they believe in relation to the Kennedy assassination. In addition to the film people should also do further research before deciding on what they believe really happened. The shooting scene is horrific and is more or less guaranteed to turn your stomach - after all this is real."

","I thoroughly enjoy the movie JFK because it does a good job portraying how the country felt at the time and it really makes you think about if what the Warren Commission has said about the assassination is true.<br/><br/>I do, however, have to ask some questions about the historical aspects of it.  Through class research and some of my own research, I have learned that not all of the ideas brought forth by the writers/director are factually accurate.  Please keep in mind while watching this film that it is merely one person's thoughts as to how the assassination of John F Kennedy happened and may or may not be accurate. The movie is a good movie and makes you think, but it cannot be utilized as evidence for how the assassination actually happened."

The facts could have been overwhelming and confusing in their profusion, but Stone places them all deftly into the sequence of events.<br/><br/>There are many familiar faces in this movie, but they are almost unrecognisable. They become their characters. The performances throughout JFK are good and realistic and the suspense and drama that binds the whole tale results in an excellent courtroom piece.

John F Kennedy was a young US president who was supposedly assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald. This film dictates more than that to it's audience, and manages to do it well.<br/><br/> Although I consider Costner to be a wooden actor(robin hood-was that meant to be an english accent?), he does well in this documentary style thriller.

"cbass-2","Null","2","13","26 July 1999"," Entertaining, but true?
","When I first saw this movie, I was amazed.  The case that Garrison presented seemed incredible and very well done.  His argument seemed to leave no question as to whether there was a conspiracy in the assassination of JFK. <br/><br/>
Then, I did some research.  I read about Clay Shaw, Guy Banister, and Fletcher Prouty (Mr. X).  A lot of what Stone presents as fact is completely false.  The address on Oswald's pamphlets did lead to an address adjacent to Guy Banister's detective agency, but the entrance listed did not lead into Guy Banister's office, they are completely different offices, completely unconnected.  Thus the connection between Banister and Oswald is not valid. Also, Kevin Bacon's character was not a real person but combination of three different personalities, and this character never had any evidence which linked Oswald, Ferrie, or Clay Shaw.  These inaccuracies are pretty significant when we relate them to Garrison's case.<br/><br/>We all have heard about the Grassy Knoll, and the ""puff of smoke"" that was seen from it.  Stone recreated this shot and we see the smoke rising from the rifle, the smoke that Lee Bowers claims to have seen from his train tower.  However, automatic rifles do not give off smoke, that is fact.  This is another significant discrepancy in the investigation.<br/><br/>I do not support the single bullet theory, I do not feel strongly about whether or not there was a conspiracy, I just want to know what happened.  I really enjoyed JFK and I am glad to have seen it because it inspired me to do some research on the subject.  I think it did raise some great points about Oswald such as the fact that he was not a great shot, and he also would have had better aim had he fired before Kennedy's car made the turn by the Depository.  I think there are still a lot of questions to be answered. For example, the shots were taken over 8 to 9 seconds (Warren Commission). That's a lot of time.  Why couldn't Kennedy have been saved in this time, before the fatal head shot?"

Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald left me speechless - a British actor playing one of (if not) the most notorious alleged killers in US history and he pulled it off beautifully.<br/><br/>The scene between Costner and Donald Sutherland as ""X"" - a former Pentagon official is one of the best scenes of cinema.

"Squonkamatic","5","2","14","14 July 2007"," Technically Masterful Manipulation of Historical Fiction
","The most important thing to remember about Oliver Stone's JFK is that it's a work of ""What If?"" type speculative fiction based on a historical event. The film also has a thesis -- that JFK was murdered by a conspiracy hatched within the government -- and uses all of Oliver Stone's cinematic skill to manipulate it's audience into agreeing with his conclusions. Is that wrong? No, but it might be irresponsible considering the extreme nature of some of Stone's conclusions. Most notably the idea that Kennedy was killed in a coup-de-tat takeover led by Lyndon Johnson. Oh, really? <br/><br/>He may have been, who knows. Like many other humans I am fascinated by the story of the Kennedy assassination and would love to get to the bottom of it, have spent my fair share of time reading both online & off since a young age about the history of the event augmented by various conspiracy and anti-conspiracy theories, and have managed to keep an open mind on the subject. Like a vast number of Americans I believe that Lee Oswald did not act alone in murdering John Kennedy, which in itself implies a belief that there probably was a conspiracy: The literal meaning of the term is that more than one person is involved. Lee Oswald is a fascinating & frightening figure from history mostly because of what a complete enigma he was in real life. I am of the opinion that he probably did shoot Kennedy from the TSBD window and was subsequently silenced by Jack Ruby (who died the day before my birthday, a fact that has always made my hair stand on end) so that the details of the plot would die with him.<br/><br/>Beyond that who knows, or rather we will have to wait until at least 2017 -- just 10 years from now, actually -- to find out what more information there may be socked away somewhere, though if you ask me it won't end up solving a damn thing. Like Joe Pesci's David Ferrie says in a totally fictional scene that was created by Oliver Stone from whole cloth, ""It's a mystery wrapped up in a riddle hidden inside of an enigma. Even the shooters don't know who killed him -- don't you get it, man?"" That might be the most telling line in the whole film.<br/><br/>And what a film it is. As a Syracuse University student studying video, film and media studies in the arts at the time of it's release I marveled at Oliver Stone and his cinematographers work, blending different movie stocks with television clips of historical films and present day recreations. The manipulation of reality is quite stunning, and so well done that there are times when one isn't entirely sure of what they are seeing or what it all means (which is exactly in step with Stone's comment that reading the Warren Commission reports was akin to ""drowning"" in information). But what concerns me this day as a post-9/11 viewer of the film, is how much are audiences aware of the extent to which the film blurs the line between history and fiction? It's a movie, with all of the implications of such a term. JFK is an entertainment, not a documentary, using a historical subject as a departure point for it's undeniably entertaining & involving plot line. My concern is that there are people whom I know personally that are convinced that JFK is in reality showing what really happened, by whom and why. It is exactly what they wanted to see, an their inability to distance themselves from the subject matter is exactly what Oliver Stone had in mind, and that is what I mean by ""irresponsible"" rather than his toying with factual data. <br/><br/>The movie should almost be shown with an accompanying disclaimer saying ""The facts and events being depicted are a fictional re-creation and should not be seen as the only possible conclusion of the events being depicted: Independent thinking is advised."" But it's still a great movie, one of the best contemporary detective stories to find it's way into the cinema, and if nothing else spurred a public re-interest in the subject that led to an amendment of the date when the sealed records of the event would be opened to the public. I honestly don't believe we will ever know exactly what happened and for that matter Stone's conclusions are as valid as anybody else's, and he did make a marvelous, ingenious movie about the subject that I would encourage anyone with an interest in it to see, especially to experience Stone's masterful manipulation of the different media techniques he uses. Just remember though, that when all is said and done it is a manipulation itself, like JAWS or STAR WARS, designed to influence the viewer and entertain them, and while it's departure point is a chapter from history the end result is primarily a work of speculative fiction.<br/><br/>5/10, which is the grade I usually assign to work that is immune to criticism but technically brilliant. You can't evaluate the movie without dealing with it's politics, which sort of stacks the deck unfairly for those who happen to agree with the conclusions made. Therefore I am only grading the movie on it's technical accomplishment, which is exactly 1/2 of the loaf, or 5 out of ten."
"lastliberal","8","2","14","17 March 2007"," The military-industrial complex
","Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex. It was not well know at the time of Kennedy's presidency. Oliver Stone presents a long and confusing argument that it was behind Kennedy's assassination. The film show Keven Costner as Jim Garrson battling the US Government and it's cronies: the ultra-right-wing fanatics represented in the movie by Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), some unidentified Cuban exiles and a former F.B.I. man named Guy Bannister (Ed Asner). Also involved are various fringe types like David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), a pilot for hire; the small-time mobster Jack Ruby (Brian Doyle Murray), and Oswald (Gary Oldman), whose place in the conspiracy has become utterly mysterious by the time the movie ends.<br/><br/>Garrison would have had an easier time convincing a jury today as the Iraq war is the very embodiment of the military-industrial complex. WhatStone suggests was behind Kennedy's death is business-as-usual in Washington. We start wars to sell bombs.<br/><br/>It was unfortunate that Stone's film came up against The Silence of the Lambs, which cleared the table at the Academy Awards. He took home two, but lost four times that many. It was a great film to go back and see. It was a reminder of a different age. An age when the Judge, the lawyers, and the defendants sat there cooling smoking as the trial went on. Bizarre."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","2","14","13 June 2004"," Very interesting film, but horrible pacing
","This film has been met with a lot of controversy, when it first came out; a lot of people have a hard time accepting that this might be the truth. I don't know for sure how much of it is based on facts, but from what I understand, it's most of it, if not all of it. The film is packed with great actors, however many of them have very minor roles in the film. Regardless, every single performance is great, there wasn't any point where I thought that any of the actors did anything less than a great job portraying their respective characters. The film is well-edited, telling a lot of the story through flashbacks, and even giving us a visual of things that ""supposedly"" happened, but quite apparently never took place. All in all, this is a great film, but it could, and should, have been a perfect one. The problem with the film lies wholly in the pacing; in the first thirty minutes, it pretty much tells you the part of the story that everybody knows; the assassination itself, Lee Harvey Oswald's arrest and the killing of Oswald. After that, the plot starts to revolve around an investigation that simply takes far too long, and it only takes so long because it's filled with, well, filler. Had it been more to the point, instead of showing scene after scene of questioning, most of them nearly the same, it would have been much easier to follow the film's plot; I'm not saying that it's simple, in fact, it's anything but simple, but it was made out to be far more complicated than it had to be. I think there was about half an hour, maybe 45 minutes of the film where I didn't pay attention, simply because virtually nothing at all happened in the film. I don't have anything against three-hour films, I've seen several that I enjoyed regardless of length(Dances with wolves, Scarface(the Al Pacino version) etc.), but those did a good job of keeping me interested in the story, and the story constantly develops in them(especially Scarface), whereas in this one, it almost stands still, while we listen to one lying witness after the other, every single lie in details, instead of just a few lines to demonstrate that this character is lying. I just think there was far too much material, however true it may be, that belongs in a director's cut or a documentary than a regular feature film. It could easily have been cut down at least half an hour. For a political film, this is very good. In fact, for a film by any standard, it is very good. It's just too bad it isn't as great as it could have been, had it been paced better. Unless you have an enormous amount of interest in the subject matter, and an equal amount of patience, you probably won't be able to sit through this. I recommend it to pretty much anyone who's interested in knowing more about the Kennedy assassination, and who has the patience that is required. 8/10"

","The power of JFK as a film is affirmed for me when re-watching our director's cut video of the 1991 film. New information jumps out of the dense montage every time I watch this movie again, usually every 3 to 4 years.<br/><br/>After nearly a decade, however, there is no longer a ""frisson"" for me in the the courtroom line delivered by Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison, pronouncing the JFK assassination to be a ""coup d'etat"", a secret murder at the heart of contemporary US history. As a Canadian, I witness right-wing US political shenanigans like the recent Presidential election, and it's the same old stuff. <br/><br/>It's been said that a country incapable of scandal is like a body incapable of pain, or a mind incapable of guilt. In my estimation, Stone does his capable filmmaker's best at trying to rehabilitate the scandal muscle in the American body politic. It is not at all clear he succeeds, though, even though his film is great entertainment and a viable ""counter myth. It seems that most often when Stone is mentioned in the US media, it's with an angry and derisive rejection of this film, and a deliberate effort to deny him stature as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Incapable of scandal?

","Oliver Stone is the first director of the post 70's generation of autuers to have his own distinct style.  That style has never been more effective.  His message has never been more important of contraversial.  That message hits us at America's quietly descending core, a piece of what this country stands for.  Oliver Stone literally looks us in the face and tells us that this country is what we make of it, and if we step back and let power and greed run the country for us, that power will be abused.  And it has.  And it was. Stone combines all the most plausable theories into one massive opus that makes a powerful movie. Although specifics are distorted and some ""facts"" may have been omitted, the truth lies within what he shows and embellishes. The constant jump cut and total scattering of ideas and theories in this film lend the past a frustrated feeling of distance.  The film is three hours, but the pacing is so fast and relentless, it just glides by like a slide show at a million miles a minute.  You have to watch it twice to catch it all.  I must also add, whatever is not true in this film, and that's a lot less than many may be led to believe, this movie is not a documentary. It uses the past and creates a conflicting myth to the one that is official, in school text books, but only believed by 30% of the nation.  This time period was so ill handled and miss documented, that an alterior myth is something special and daring.  It just may inspire people to look up what's official and what's not, what's real, or fictional.  And this applies to both the Warren Report and Oliver Stones' Collage.  It may even get a few people to demand the truth, to vote, to take part in a government that revolves around that very action.  This is a noble film that never demands the audience believe what it sees. It show a completely opposite perspective that 70% of us have thought possible since that fateful day.

Also, he more than insinuates that the country would have stayed out of Vietnam and been a virtual Shangri-La.  Absolute garbage on all counts.  This film does an injustice to the softer-headed people in this country, whose opinions are shaped solely by moving images.<br/><br/>As I left the theater after viewing 'JFK,' I overhead someone, also exiting, who said that they were embarrassed to be an American.

You can't help but get draw into Stone's ideas about the Kennedy assassination, even if the facts aren't 100% accurate, this is still an implacably acted, well-photographed detective thriller.<br/><br/>
Plus Stone has gathered together a highly talented cast, and at times you could almost see the film as just a long line of celebrity cameos, but the acting is still faultless. We have Donald Sutherland as X, Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw, Joe Pesci (in a frightening wig) and my personal favourite Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald (fantastic performance). Every one is working at their best, and that includes Stone, he was clearly very passionate about putting his views forward to the public, and he argues a very persuasive case. <br/><br/>Everyone will have their own ideas about this case, and weather you buy into Stone's theory or not is secondary, this is a film that has to be seen.

","This is a well-made, suspenseful movie--in spite of it being about the most famous murder in history. When I watched the movie--most of which narratively was told in retrospect--I felt the knot of suspense that I feel while watching a fictitious thriller---even though I know what's going to happen because it's historical! <br/><br/>I'm also an amateur historian, a trial attorney who deals with the problems of reconstructing past events by using various types of evidence. Over the years I've read most of the Warren Report; I've read the conspiracy books. I find flaws in the former--and serious error in logic on the latter. Long ago, I concluded the evidence available was overwhelmingly demonstrative of Lee Harvey Oswald's factually causing the death of the president by shooting him with the rifle found. How that would have played forensically in a real trial is impossible to say. <br/><br/>The conspiracy writers have no evidence of anything, just holes in the evidence presented by the Warren Commission. From these holes come theories that devolve into circular arguments where they end up proving the theory by assuming to be true. If the conspiracy writers could have been able to assist Oswald's defense counsel (hypothetically), they could have created reasonable doubt, which may have acquitted Oswald--or gotten him on reduced charge of manslaughter. But enough reasonable doubt to prevent a conviction is NOT the same thing as proving beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of other alleged culprits.<br/><br/>But this is a movie website, made for movie buffs like myself, who enjoy reading about movies and discussing movies and reading what other film buffs have to say about movies. As a movie, JFK is something I have watched a few times because it is so well crafted. I suspect Oliver Stone must be tough as a director because he also got performances out actors I didn't think possible--even known talents. It's editing, the music, the sound, the sets--everything creates this bizarre, paranoid effect, where nothing is as it seems. Like one of the legendary conductors that can move an entire orchestra to great climactic crescendos, Stone creates a thriller set withing a courtroom drama. <br/><br/>It's a virtuoso work, that also shows mastery of narrative technique, such as shifting point-of-view, retrospect and foreshadowing, story-within-a-story, building to devastating and heartbreaking ending of JFK's death and of a traumatized nation left with fear, uncertainty and unanswerable questions in the middle of a nightmarish Cold War.<br/><br/>As an historian, I am not moved very much from what I still believe to be the sad, absurd and unspectacular truth. As a lawyer, I am impressed with the way reasonable doubt can be generated by working up facts more likely to be deemed irrelevant at a trial; equally, I am relieved to see that reasonable doubt to prevent a guilty verdict in the trial of one person (which never happened) is not sufficient to prove conspiracy in the trial of another. As a movie fan, I am awed with what a great director can do with historical material and a good cast and crew. As an American, I am also glad that movies like this can be made. It is the mark of a society free enough to express such withering criticism of the government without fear of punishment.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it yet, and that it be seen repeatedly by those who have already seen it. The mark of a classic is it that can speak to people of all generations--and differently to the same person moving through life into older generations."

","I have not seen this movie. How can I therefore render a judgment on it? I have not read any material on Holocaust denial, nor have I read deSade's 'Justine', nor the Nazi Racial Purity laws either, but that does not prevent historically informed and morally centered persons from making judgments on those. <br/><br/>The febrile fantasies of Jim Garrison, a sadly deluded and pitiable figure, have been rejected by the overwhelming weight of respectable reportorial research; his delusions are accepted only by those unfortunates like Oliver Stone whose minds, having wandered too long in the jungles of left-wing paranoia, are now hopelessly lost in the fever swamps of conspiratorial hysteria.<br/><br/>A schizophrenic cannot be faulted, I suppose, for viewing his world as fact; it is, after all, the only reality he knows. But Stone, as a skilled film maker, can most definitely be faulted for making a film which interweaves historical film footage and documented fact with fictional material. The result - as Stone certainly knows - will be accepted by 85% of the American booboisie, to use Mencken's phrase, as a documentary. Thus will a great proportion of those who view this film come to believe, despite a shred of supporting evidence, that Lyndon Johnson, the CIA, and the military were complicit in the Kennedy assassination. To thus propogate such a monstrous historical falsity is to commit a perfidy of Brobdingnagian proportions.<br/><br/>Stone is to be reviled for making this film, a fitting companion piece to 'Natural Born Killers' for the Movie Hall of Shame."
"detroit11689","8","1","6","21 September 2014"," 85/100 for JFK
","Oliver Stone's JFK is filled with passion. From the very first scene it captivates and intrigues. For those who have lived through the time of the the murder of JFK is seems like another blatant propaganda movie. But for young viewers like myself, its brimming with interesting and thoughtful ideas. The key in watching JFK is to separate fact from fiction. But to label Oliver Stone's film propaganda is in incorrect. JFK simply presents an idea that is entirely plausible. The acting is superb. Kevin Costner delivers through just like he always does. And there are other terrific actors, notably Joe Pesci and Tommy Lee Jones. The movie moves along with rapid fire pace, it slows down in the middle, then delivers a hard hitting third act like no other. JFK is a stunning movie, however Oliver stone takes up liberties, rather than facts. 85/100."

","There's a great movie waiting to be made about the Kennedy killings and the sheer hogwash the government expected people to accept. Oliver Stone's JFK movie (assessed apart from it's scandal-rich premiere) is a lousy, scatterbrained, corny, half-baked movie. It's made ineptly and it's composed of the flimsiest string of three lonely conceits. 1) A very crappy star turn by Costner, again playing Mr. Morality 2) One or two sequences that clearly received more of Stone's attention (they actually build - Fletcher Prouty) and 3) An all star cast. The script may offer the wobbliest plot ever filmed; a single-minded crusader doesn't have a prayer of winning his laughably assembled conspiracy case; also... he has the defacto ""whiny wife"" (Spacek). Stone hopes to provide enough surface activity that you won't notice he has no guiding concept, that the all-star cast is actually undermining the movie and the damned thing is going nowhere. Despite earnestness and good intentions, it has no momentum, no ending and precious little intelligence. An overwrought score beats you over the head in an effort to inject some intensity.<br/><br/>The climactic court case is just absurd (and belabored). It feels like Stone needed both a dramatic climax and a morality showdown, and manufactured this weak, weak case to those ends. The case is composed of barely-connected, legally ridiculous courtroom moments; Garrison badgers people whose connection to Clay Shaw is indecipherable until his final 20 words attempt a weak link. If the case actually went as depicted, it's no surprise Garrison lost, because he speechifies about everything except how Clay Shaw is related to the killing.<br/><br/>In casting every role large, Stone bowdlerizes the assassination by advancing a solution that looks trifling compared to the scale of the machinations and his production. In the end JFK's assassination is pinned on some utterly nonthreatening gay bogeyman (an idea that has no place to go) for god knows what reason ...how very small.<br/><br/>In need of passion, the movie pours on the straw-man antics; there's a zero-sum game fight every twenty minutes. Ridiculous lines like ""Let justice rain till the heavens fall"" and ""We're through the looking-glass now, people..."" intended to make major dramatic moments are just bad dramatics. Not helping any of this, are some very poor, over-the-top southern accents. Everyone from the south doesn't talk with a full-on, corn-pone accent, but tell a star his character is from the south and it's vocal amateur hour. Metcalf is quite bad. Costner sounds like Elmer Fudd, despite the fact that Jim Garrison himself has a cameo in the damned movie, and has NO regional accent whatsoever. (?!)<br/><br/>The controversy that surrounded the movies opening reflects a legitimate failing of the movie. You would have to be a JFK assassination scholar to detect and determine what elements are factual, and what has been completely manufactured by Stone for the movie. It's all presented as fact. The best that can be said of the movie is, thank God Stone got access to the Zapruder film so that it could be disseminated at a massive, irretrievable scale; placing it in front of incorruptible audience-eyes that won't forget what they've seen. The horror of the 26 second Zapruder film is indelible."
"mgd_m","4","1","7","16 August 2019"," False history
","JFK is the bible of conspiracy theorists. 90% of this story has been debunked, and in my opinion it's a frightening example of human paranoia.<br/><br/>I watched it again hoping for good cinema, but it's not. It's unnecessarily long, even accounting for the complexity of the story. Tons of scenes are wasted on useless family and professional dramas, and unimportant investigation details. So, you get the impression that Stone aims for the epic and pompous piece of Hollywood history, rather than making justice to real history.<br/><br/>The only thing I appreciated was Gary Oldman as HL Oswald."
"bkoganbing","7","1","7","23 October 2012"," The Real Story?
","The questions that everyone raises about Oliver Stone's JFK is whether the choice to make the controversial District Attorney Jim Garrison the protagonist/hero of the piece. A cursory glance at even the Wikipedia article about Garrison shows a career full of controversy, his investigation of the Kennedy assassination only the most known.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner plays Garrison who is presented as Mr. Average Man of the new South going through at this time the catharsis of the social change the Civil Rights Era wrought. A couple names known to him surface in reports about the assassination and Garrison starts his own probe. It brings him the most controversy in a controversial career and nearly wrecks his domestic situation as wife Sissy Spacek threatens to leave and take the kids.<br/><br/>The most flamboyant performance in the film is that of Joe Pesci as David Faerie who was the linchpin of Garrison's case. He was the link to the late Lee Harvey Oswald and the collection of folks that Garrison eventually indicted. Remember all the action in the film ended in 1969 a few months before the Stonewall Rebellion. We're introduced in this case to a bunch of gay conservatives, in fact they're downright reactionary. Faerie is a pilot and part of the underground gay culture that New Orleans had. Today it's a lot more open I assure you. Today this bunch would be Log Cabin Republicans.<br/><br/>The group is headed by Tommy Lee Jones playing Clay Shaw who since just about everyone in the Sixties was in the closet, Jones ruled the gay closet in New Orleans at the time. Unlike Faerie or Kevin Bacon who plays a favorite boy toy of the clique and who get busted in bar raids regularly, Jones is rich enough to be above all that. I'm surprised he didn't retain Roy Cohn as an attorney although he probably figured a New York Jew wouldn't go over big in a New Orleans court.<br/><br/>At the time Oliver Stone got pilloried for delving on the gay aspect of the conspirators. That was an error, these guys were what they were. Whether Garrison was really on to something is a whole other matter which we may never know until everything about the Kennedy assassination is declassified.<br/><br/>Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are in this and it is on the list of their collaborative work although they have no scenes together. Matthau has a scene on an airplane with Costner and Matthau plays Senator Russell B. Long of Louisiana, son of a man who was assassinated himself. He's most skeptical about the Warren Report. Lemmon plays a gumshoe operative working for Edward Asner playing Guy Bannister who was linked to Shaw. He was a nasty, brutal, reactionary drunk and gets into it with Lemmon on the day of the assassination in flashback. Lemmon gives Costner some leads in the right direction. <br/><br/>JFK is a film that provides a view of the Kennedy assassination, but good as it is should be taken with a grain of salt."

"barryrd","8","1","8","21 April 2014"," Ongoing Grief Over John F. Kennedy
","Combining a conspiracy theory of the Kennedy assassination with real film footage and stellar cast, Oliver Stone has fashioned a highly entertaining movie in JFK. In his overall work, Stone has drawn on events from American history that are touchstones for the post-1945 generation and this is certainly one, as was apparent in the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination in 2013. <br/><br/>Theuse of the Zapruder film and other film recordings are part of the retelling of this event and have long contributed to the public's unease over the conclusions of the Warren Commission Report that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of the President. So once again, the visual evidence forms part of the movie. <br/><br/>The cast is excellent in a drama that gives a fictionalized account of what happened to JFK. Whether or not it represents historical truth is not the point of the movie. Stone is telling a story that shows a certain point of view to an audience that lived through the assassination and craves for some meaning in a tragic event.<br/><br/>The idea that the CIA, the Pentagon, Lyndon Johnson, and a group of conspirators based in New Orleans managed to change the course of history will catch the attention of Americans who remember the event because it was so traumatic. Oliver Stone's success in levering the events of his time into entertainment is his stock in trade and no more on display than here. The acting of Joe Pesci as David Ferrie and Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw were particularly notable, not to mention the mystery man played by Donald Sutherland. <br/><br/>The behind the scenes stories of characters associated with the story lures us into the ongoing temptation of wanting to believe that there is an explanation to bring closure to a loss that haunts many of us, not just Americans. Stone's movie brings it all back and again stirs up the doubts that linger in the public's mind."
"zaphodb1","7","1","8","14 July 2013"," An Unfortunate Episode in US National and Political Affairs
","JFK is based on two books ‚Äì On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs. JFK sets the scene by showing an historical account of Kennedy's Presidency, from the Bay of Pigs invasion, through to the Cuban missile crisis and finally Kennedy's assassination. The film then covers the background leading to the assassination including the planning of a second Cuban invasion by a group of ex-Cubans, Lee Harvey Oswald and his defection to Russia and return to the USA and his relationship to the ex-Cubans and Guy Bannister ‚Äì ex FBI agent and investigator. The film then follows Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), the New Orleans District Attorney who in 1966 disagreed with the Warren Commission's finding of a lone assassin, and re-opens the Kennedy assassination and attempts to convict Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) of involvement. The film shows Garrison's attempts to reconstruct the assassination, his interviews with witnesses and his personal life. Garrison also has a meeting with a Government official (Mr X) who explains the big picture of a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and encourages Garrison to keep digging. Garrison uses the trial, via his summing up speech, as a vehicle to attack the findings of the Warren Commission, alleging a cover-up, including asserting that there were multiple gunmen and alleging a conspiracy of the military-industrial complex.<br/><br/>As a film, I found it too long, a little slow initially and the use of quick cuts and low camera angles, a little excessive. The film is notable for attracting a star studded cast, including several cameo appearances. Interestingly of all the A-list actor appearances, all but Gary Oldman are Democrat leaning.<br/><br/>However what cannot be overlooked is the film's statement, which is remarkable. The film attracted a lot of controversy, interestingly including from the press. The Warren Commission did make a lot of errors and while the film is an interpretation of the available facts and reasonable assumptions, with some modification for storytelling effect, it seems the true story may never be told. The film is perfectly valid in attempting to highlight the inconsistencies of the official account of Kennedy's assassination with assumptions/facts.<br/><br/>We now know that the CIA at the time was involved in destabilising a number of other countries leadership in the name of the cold war. Kennedy did try and remove covert activities from the CIA and transfer them to the US military. There were also many suspicious deaths of witnesses of the Kennedy assassination, probably to prevent Garrison's use in his court case. And there also was the assassination of Bobby Kennedy after he nominated for President and outlined that he would follow in his brother's footsteps.<br/><br/>On the balance of probabilities, it is very likely that there was a cover-up of Kennedy's assassination. To this day, the true killers have not been brought to justice. Does it matter. America won the Cold War, and even Democrat Presidents now endorse the tactics of the CIA and the Pentagon (eg the drone killings and the recent revelations by Edward Snowden about the US spying on its own citizens and other countries ‚Äì both presided over by Obama). So perhaps Kennedy was naive and was wrong to try and tame the CIA. It is in the least, an unfortunate episode in US national and political affairs."

What I really liked about this film was the fact that they used real footage of JFK. There were no actors playing him, it was actually him. He got shot right at the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the movie was about District Attorney Jim Garrison, who believes that Lee Harvey Oswald was used as a patsy and Kennedy was shot by someone else.

The current (2013) fashion and mania and center stage status of comic book, superhero ""action"" movies packed with special effects and computer generated images (CGI's!) is all about the LACK of good screen writing available to the movie industry, which serves a huge and profitable market (aka the world wide audience reading and willing to pay big money for the distraction from their awful lives provided by a good, entertaining movie), and substitutes video game type psychedelica (both visual and audio images and sounds) to dazzle without the need for mental logic or coherent ideas.<br/><br/>Well......good screenplays are hard to come by, always were.<br/><br/>The ""JFK"" (1991) screenplay resulted in a wonderful, magnetic, riveting movie packed with long, long, long compelling monologues delivered by wonderful, verbally capable actors (Kevin Costner, Donald Sutherland, others) which ""action heroes"" of fame and note (e.g. Clint Eastwood, bless him) could never have, and will never deliver.<br/><br/>Clint, even in his 80's, can jump out of windows and slug bad guys, but he can't provide articulate, sustained intelligent long, long monologues filled with polysyllabic words and complex but logical ideas which go on and and on and on..and keep us all on the edge of our seats, and make us grateful we were lucky enough to see a great movie with almost NO ""action"" and visual crutches the ""no ideas"" ""silent super hero"" movies based on Marvel Comics types shove at us in current times (2013).<br/><br/>Only well educated and articulate actors can ""talk the talk"" and present long, intelligent arguments, and ""JFK"" (1991) does that well, to it's credit.<br/><br/>For those who don't know, ""JFK"" (1991) is a Kennedy assassination conspiracy movie based on Jim Garrison's assertions, legal actions, and book with help from yet another Kennedy assassination conspiracy book..<br/><br/>What the brilliant Oliver Stone and his co-authors have done is simple and wonderful.<br/><br/>They have taken a ""single issue"" argument and ""cause"" well known to the public and famous everywhere, and made a movie consisting of long, long monologues presenting in logical and articulate detail various related arguments in such zealous detail, any lawyer advocate of ability would be dazzled.<br/><br/>And dazzled we, the audience, are....by this movie and it's simple device......logical long monologues presented by well equipped (for monologues) actors which are implicitly dramatic and appealing.<br/><br/>""Single issue"" causes (such as the Kennedy assassination conspiracy arguments) are dramatic and satisfying.<br/><br/>They provide the audience with a good time for the same reason a good football game provides good times to onlookers.<br/><br/>Logic, oddly, has very little to do with it all.<br/><br/>""Single issue"" causes not seriously challenged or contradicted (the case in ""JFK"" 1991) SEEM logical and deliver a delicious satisfaction to the audience.<br/><br/>This has nothing to do with whether or not the ""cause"" presented is worthy or whether the conclusions advocated are accurate and true.<br/><br/>It's all about the psychological satisfaction of hearing a good one sided case well presented which we've all heard about before, and can never know about completely....nobody can for most famous ""single issue"" causes of fame.<br/><br/>And there are many, many, MANY ""single issue causes"" of fame over history which could ALSO be presented in movie form using the techniques of screen writing used in ""JFK"" (1991), which would make incredibly successful and satisfying movies (again, let us emphasize that logic has little to do with emotional and mental satisfaction...a good ""single issue"" movie filled with monologues must avoid on-screen challenges to the case it presents....the fact it's one sided is what will make it a successful movie!<br/><br/>Richard Hofstader's brilliant book titled ""The Paranoid Style In American Politics"" (1952 Harvard U. Press) discusses the fame and success of single issue causes. <br/><br/>Hofstadter states, rightly, that single cause writing (which the ""JFK"" 1991 screenplay definitely is) is successful due to ""the fierce logic of the one-idea mind, the firm conviction that complex social issues can be unraveled to the last point, that social problems can really be solved, and solved by simple means."" The back up materials which can feed a movie screenplay of the ""JFK"" (1991) type are copious and available almost in tidal wave proportions.<br/><br/>What is Hollywood waiting for? It's time for more ""single issue causes"" movies with many long, long monologues delivered by good actors......<br/><br/>The movie makers will get rich, and the lucky audiences will be endlessly satisfied!.<br/><br/>------------ <br/><br/>Tex (David) Allen is a retired SAG-AFTRA movie actor who taught movie history 5 years in Baltimore MD USA area colleges from 2004-2009."
"pharvey-602-223188","9","1","8","7 February 2013"," An unrelenting search for the truth
","I have watched Oliver Stone's JFK several times now, and after every viewing I quickly jump on-line and type into Google 3 simple words - 'Who Killed JFK'. After watching 3 hours of Kevin Costner and his team searching high and low for the truth behind the supposed conspiracy that led to JFK's assassination, I am always left with more questions than answers. This film compels me to look further for the answers. This film makes me angry that the whole truth is still not fully known ‚Äì and I'm an Australian! <br/><br/>Simply, JFK is a 'who-done-it', police procedural, thriller of the highest order. It is pure entertainment, with fine performances and a director that is clearly in love with his work. But it is much more than that. <br/><br/>The power this film has wielded since its release has been well documented. Oliver Stone's JFK has proved to be not only riveting entertainment, but a persuasive tool in influencing US legislation. The reception to this film led to the formation of the U.S. Assassination Records Review Board. So I'm not the only one this film compels to search further for answers... <br/><br/>Just as the road to the truth in JFK is fraught with stubborn resistance, so too was the making of JFK. Oliver Stone's movie was lambasted by some critics for supposedly re-writing history with trouble making, speculative fiction. This started before the film was even released. But, I don't believe Stone is being definitive with the conclusions he delivers here, but rather offers viewers an alternative to Lee Harvey Oswald, the lone assassin. The proportion of fact to fiction in the film is up for debate, but as time passes, I believe that the percentage of fact is proving to be ever increasing. <br/><br/>The film is based on the book by former New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who, played by Kevin Costner, becomes the films hero and catalyst. Costner's Garrison is genuine but bland. However, he is also stubbornly determined enough to propel the film towards its resolution. Garrison initially investigates New Orleans based links to the assassination that leads him to uncover his bigger conspiracy picture. He and his team track down the various 'bad guy' players. Amongst others, Joe Pesci plays David Ferrie, a ground level manic militant ringleader, with a frenetic mouth, even by Pesci standards. Tommy Lee Jones plays Clay Shaw (if that is his real name), a homosexual corporate type with an unflinching gravitas. And Gary Oldman shows us a frighteningly cold Oswald. <br/><br/>Garrison gets help along the way from his New Orleans team of lawyers and investigators, and from Donald Sutherland, who with such little screen time manages to spew out more conspiracy theories than the entire Mel Gibson film Conspiracy Theory, whilst portraying a shady high level source reminiscent of 'deep throat' in All the President's Men. Other memorable performances are provided by Kevin Bacon, Walther Matthau and Jack Lemon, who all supply key morsels of information and puzzle pieces. <br/><br/>JFK is also a film editing master-class, incorporating real documentary footage into the mix at every opportunity, and managing to implant a mountain of facts into the viewers mind. This is all done whilst keeping up a rapid pace, nothing akin to a documentary at all. We are led at this rapid pace, with all the facts in hand, to the final courtroom scene where Garrison lays his theory on the line. I must admit, even given all the evidence Garrison uses to back up his case, I can't help but feel that it is all a bit thin. There is still too much speculative logic to have me convinced in his case. In saying this, I am certainly not convinced that his case is untrue."

","This film was a great example of what or how the government can use lethal force to kill with extreme prejudice. John F. Kennedy, the greatest president who sought to pull out troops from Vietnam had been gunned down in Texas on Nov 22, 1963. Mainly because of the war mongering generals being upset that their own interests within Vietnam was to establish grounds to test many kinds of new military devices in war. But to do that, they needed a ruse in which to launch their plot, hence the Gulf of Tonken incident. For which even to this day, most military personnel that were at ton-ken, said nothing happened. Not one fire shot, or any weapons discharged to start the war. Now since Kennedy was adamant about pulling out his men, the join chiefs who were involved went to extremes in keeping the gulf open to opportunities. So, in assassinating the president, and having Johnson sworn in soon after the Vietnam war began in full force. Yet behind the lines at home, Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) found enough evidence to bring a certain man to justice by investigating the backgrounds of key individuals in order to show the people a conspiracy of killing the president. Now with his team are Bill Brousard (Micheal Rooker) who at the time was a kind of liaison to the district attorney's office by day, and an FBI agent by night. Through him, his defences had been brought to light because of Garrison's accusations against some key players. However, because of Jim's intellect and instinct found out that Bill was not all that he seemed to be and tried to either kill Garrison, or slow him down long enough to allow the FBI to work up some new evidence in favour of Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones). Now with all of this working against Garrison and his team, Jim, must present evidence to the court of why or how Shaw was involved in killing Kennedy. But to throw a bone in further and to mix up the truth, another of Shaw's men David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) had been cast in as a kind of psychopath, a kind of Castro extremist who was a wing nut by all standards. I thought through the court room scene was the best I have ever witnessed. Oliver stone brought us something for which all people can actually scrutinize and say, Why would someone kill a good man? Why go to the trouble of murdering a president just because the US wanted peace? It was the people this film was directed to, not the government, not the joint chiefs, nor the patsy's. It was the people alone. A great example of casting if I ever saw one, Walter Mathau, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland who played a remarkable role as the colonel who retired his position because of high ranking mistakes from the Washington government to protect the president. His key role was astounding in his explanations to why he was transferred to the south pole, or how he figured out in such little time of what was going on in the capital. Ingredients such as this gave this movie an aspiring awe of scope, detail, marvellous acting, and impact scenes for which will give me either simple dreams, or utter nightmares. Our governments cannot be trusted any longer, the machine is too equipped for the people to stop on their own let alone storming the castle. But as history provides us many facts, that a country was built by the people, not the politicians. If there will be a time for the house of cards to tumble, it is going to be sooner than we anticipate. And when it happens, a new era will begin in the human race. To what, we don't know. Excellent film, recommended to all over the age of fourteen."
"Maniac-9","8","1","8","9 February 2012"," Oliver Stone's best work
","Oliver Stone has a cast of many great actors in this tale of educated speculation into what really happened to President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Stone's gripping drama unravels a lot of the mystery of what may have happened on that November afternoon. Pretty much shooting down the entire concept of the magic bullet theory. A lot of the speculation of why JFK was taken out was he intended on pulling out of Vietnam. The assassination of Kennedy will always go down as one of the horrific things to happen to the American people, only thing that goes beyond it would be 9/11. The movie shows just how corrupt the government was back then."
"jedi10-682-101769","10","1","8","20 October 2011"," One of the Best films of All time.
","It is Oliver Stone's greatest work. All the pieces are in place, a great director, an all star cast and of course a John Williams' score. I saw this film when I was 13 years old not even close to be aging appropriate and it blew me away. A 3 hour film feels like a 2 hour journey into the descent of America. The cinematography won an Oscar and Oliver won Best Director at the Golden Globes.<br/><br/>The movie has been bashed for taking a number of things from creative licensing of characters, to wild theories and being propaganda against the government. While its up to you to decide that or not, it does not change the fact this case happened. All the information about magic bullets, JFK's brain missing, the assaults on Jim Garrison and the players involved in New Orleans are all true. That is what is lost in all the complaining that a good chunk of this actually happened. I would also suggest people listen to Oliver Stone's audio commentary done a few years later to get a better idea where some of the facts and myths lie. The hobos just turned out to be hobos, but his Nightline interview is very revealing where he was attacked like Garrison was. The commentary is worth the price of the DVD alone.<br/><br/>As for the movie, it is one of the last films out there that requires you to think and think hard. Even if 10% to 20% is Hollywood, the other 80% to 90% is pretty scarily true especially the Oswald stuff. You probably have the greatest group of actors ever in this picture. Oldman, Tommy Lee, Costner, Martin Sheen, Sissy, Jack Lemon and Joe Peschi. You even have Walter Mathuew and John Candy in small roles. You will never get that much talent into one film ever again and its probably due to the talent this film was made. All the actors sans Sutherland have a passion about this film. Sutherland has not helped matters saying its all nonsense even after knowing he was playing a real Colonel. If this movie was done in the 70s or 80s, everyone would be black listed especially Stone who probably has not fully recovered from this film. Yet, it is a heroic effort about heroic people. Garrison and his staff are the real heroes who did win the case years later in the arena of public opinion. Most polls show a belief that Kennedy was killed by a conspiracy, its just which one. That was the point of the case and it like the movie succeed all expectations.<br/><br/>After reading the FAQ about this movie, someone did a great smear job about this film. All of those sans the technical parts should be deleted. The Beltran/Shaw confession did happen which was the turn point of the case."
"zephyr-123","5","1","8","1 October 2011"," Don't stop here. . .
","The thing about this movie, after having seen it in my 20's, is in it's construction. It is brilliantly acted with an amazing cast. The construction and presentation are flawless. The problems with it are in the details. When I first saw this movie, like many others, I bought everything presented hook, like and sinker. I didn't really research the subject, read anything or watch documentaries on the assassination. For years I walked around bubble-headed believing the theories in the movie. Well, I now put that down to being young and stupid. I just want to say that if you are interested in the assassination, don't stop with researching the information by simply watching JFK.<br/><br/>After seeing documentaries and doing a little reading, I discovered that this movie contains outright lies. Even conspiracy theories should be based on available facts. This movie bases theories on theories. For instance, the ""magic bullet theory"" is an idea that is based on recreating the shooting of JFK and Connelly but it is based on positioning the two incorrectly in the vehicle. When recreating the shooting by positioning them correctly, there is not a ""magic"" zigzagging bullet. It went straight through the both of them. The movie claims that Oswald couldn't have acquired the shots that killed Kennedy, but in seeing documentaries that recreate the shots and the injuries sustained, it has been proved that he could very easily have succeeded even with the cumbersome weapon he chose. The movie not only makes up information, it even makes up people who didn't exist to tell it. The woman lawyer who is shown working on Jim Garrison's staff did not exist and was created to give Garrison the image of being progressive in hiring a female lawyer when his entire staff was actually male. If you are going to present conspiracy theories, at least stick to the way events actually happened. In watching a documentary about Lyndon Johnson, I discovered that there is no way he was involved. After the shooting, he was just as discombobulated, grieving and upset about it as everyone else and was desperately trying very hard to handle the situation in a way that the broken American public could feel secure. He may have screwed up in various ways as president (Vietnam comes to mind) but did not kill Kennedy. It's ridiculous.<br/><br/>Another thing I came to realize is that even if there is a possibility of a conspiracy, the chance that all of these people and factions that the movie claims is responsible are working in tandem is as far fetched as it can get. I went from believing every line of this movie, to simply believing that maybe one of these factions were involved and finally (after doing much more research on the subject) came to believe that Oswald alone killed JFK. I can see that I'm not the only one that has made this mistake as there are many people writing reviews and talking on the board as if this is the ""bible"" of conspiracy theories and somehow proves those theories when on closer inspection it is a house of cards. ""The problem that I and most historians would have with Oliver Stone, is not his talent--he's a wonderful filmmaker--but that he's used this to put certain myths into the American bloodstream that abide to this day."" Michael Beschloss, ABC News Consultant. Yes this movie is brilliantly put together but it is inundated with lies.<br/><br/>Whatever you believe, please do not use this movie as the only yardstick in determining the truth for yourself."

"jslax02","7","1","8","22 June 2011"," Entertaining, but melodramatic
","Found the premise and exploration of the possible conspiracies fascinating, but aside from Costner and Sanders, the performances are over dramatized. While most of the film is entertaining, a lot of scenes push the whole ""you cant imagine scope of what's happening"", a bit too far. I would imagine a lot of the witness accounts were heavily exaggerated to promote the idea of a cover up. I wish they could have kept it more about the case and shortened it a bit, because the whole conflict on him being too absorbed in the case causing him to become distant with his family was a bit painful to watch. Also, maybe in that generation and part of the country, they do freak out when you question the government, but I found the younger guy's reaction in that meeting a bit over-done. So, all in all a good movie, which could have been better. Also, I think Joe Pesci only knows one level of acting, which is be as angry as possible."
"ringfire211","9","1","9","29 August 2012"," Best Oliver Stone film so far!! Have yet to see NIXON...
","Saw this film last week and was very impressed with it.<br/><br/>From Costner's performance as Jim Garrison to a stellar supporting cast of such greats as Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, Donald Sutherland, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, John Candy (in a rare serious role), Sissy Spacek, etc. All brilliant stuff!! <br/><br/>I know Oliver Stone can be a controversial figure but I just think this film ran like a well-oiled machine. It was super-long and yet I didn't feel bored or tired. It sucked me right in. From Robert Richardson's cinematography (which won an Oscar) to the brilliant editing (also won an Oscar) it ran like clockwork. I love the documentary style of filming that Stone employed here. You have clear cinematography interspersed with grainy cinematography, you've got real live footage mixed in with the actors, you've got flashbacks and present day, you've got newspaper clippings and slow-motion shots. Heck, you've got every single film technique employed here and it all works! Plus you've got multiple stories running simultaneously. Love this stuff! You feel like you're right there in the thick of things.<br/><br/>Plus this film points out what many people suspected for years and still do - that the JFK assassination was indeed a conspiracy and not the work of some lone gunman. Heck, my parents always maintained it was Krushchev. Others say it was Castro or the mob. Stone (or at least the Jim Garrison character that Costner plays) says it was our own government and the war-profiteering big shots in Washington (perhaps even LBJ himself). JFK was going to end the Vietnam War. So he had to be killed. Same with RFK. Obviously the conspiracies differ - but one thing that most seem to agree on is that it was not the work of a lone gunman named Lee Harvey Oswald. A conspiracy did exist. The Warren Commission Report was indeed very sketchy, to say the least. I'm inclined to believe this as well.<br/><br/>When it comes to Stone's films I thought PLATOON was merely okay. Nothing special. Same thing with WALL STREET. I found W. somewhat amusing - probably because of its satirical approach. Josh Brolin was pretty good as Dubya but Dick Dreyfuss was a real hoot as Dick Cheney! Alexander was crap! But JFK is the first Stone film that I'd say was really very good. I am now looking forward to NIXON with Anthony Hopkins. Stone describes JFK as a labor of love (and it shows in the execution) and calls it his GODFATHER. He says NIXON is his GODFATHER II. So I'm looking forward to it. Might need to check out SALVADOR at some point too.<br/><br/>By the way, the version I saw was JFK: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT. Haven't seen any other versions so I don't know what the differences are.<br/><br/>P.S. I forgot to mention the score by John Williams. Amazing piece!! Very atmospheric and effective - both the main theme and the conspiratorial theme."
"pfgpowell-1","7","1","9","28 May 2011"," As a film, OK. As serious analysis a tad dodgy. Always remember that this is fiction
","There's the truth about why John Kennedy was assassinated and by whom and then there's Oliver Stone's epic JFK. It is generally, although not universally, accepted that Lee Harvey Oswald was indeed a 'patsy' and set up to take the wrap, and that the Warren Commission and its report were a rather hamfisted whitewash. But that is about all we can safely allow ourselves to believe to know, and everything else is still as clear as mud. The problem with Stone's JFK is that it is first and foremost a fiction, with fictional elements which, although intended to demonstrate a higher 'dramatic' truth, are still made up, invented, constructed. For all I know the thesis of the film is wholly accurate (although one website in particular has dedicated itself to debunking much of Stone's film). On the other hand it might well be wholly inaccurate, and it doesn't seem that we will be able to know definitively one way or the other any time soon. But when considering Stone's film JFK, the one thing we must never forget is that it is a fiction and furthermore, given the nature of Hollywood filmmaking, one produced for commercial gain. So, for example, it includes several wholly fictional characters, of which the gay hustler Willie O'Keeffe and the assistant DA Bill Bruissard are just two and severa wholly fictional scenes.<br/><br/>Yet many people ‚Äì in fact, a great many people ‚Äì will have walked out of the cinema after watching JFK believing that the Kennedy murder mystery has finally been solved, that the conspiracy was, in the words of the film's DA Jim Garrison, nothing less than a coup d'etat backed by the military industrial complex of the US which saw Kennedy as bad for business. According to Stone's film that coup d'etat and the assassination conspiracy were achieved with the backing of the CIA, the FBI and Dallas' police department. And, what is even more alarming is that, given the potency of film, Stone's ‚Äì fictional - account might well in time become the accepted and definitive account. But I'll repeat: we have no way of knowing how much or how little of it is true or even close to true.<br/><br/>By chance I have been reading another analysis of the assassination by the British writer Anthony Summers (and was thus already familiar with many of the names of the whole affair's protagonists). Summer's book is not a work of fiction but attempts to sift through the confusion of fact and evidence surrounding Oswald. Although Summers is at pains to avoid being seen to 'solve the case' and states that his objective is simply to lay out the evidence as we know it, his book does suggest strongly that there was Mafia involvement in Kennedy's murder and, even more so that, of anti-Castro Cuban exiles. In this writer's view, assassination by Cuban exiles with the assistance of the Mafia (who hated Kennedy and his brother Robert) and rather a lot of rogue elements in the CIA and FBI, strikes me as being a great deal more plausible than the man being bumped of by his own side, not least of whom was the man who succeeded Kennedy as president (and who apparently reversed Kennedy's policy to pull out of Vietnam and instead escalated US involvement in the conflict. Yet that, very plausible and well-documented aspect of the assassination is not even hinted at in Stone's film. There is not a whisper of Cuban exiles, despite Oswald's well-known dealings with them. Summers agrees that there was a great deal of very odd CIA, FBI and Dallas police department behaviour, but does not suggest that this was official policy (rather, he believes that official stubbornness which covered up a great deal of odd behaviour by the security forces stemmed from a proud esprit de corps, my side right or wrong) at no point does anything he writes suggest that a coup d'etat lay at the core of the assassination.<br/><br/>That, on the other hand, lies at the heart of Stone's film, and the meeting between Garrison and the mysterious Mr X (a disillusioned high-up soldier who claimed he ran a black ops unit) is pivotal. So what is it? Who's right? Your guess is as good as mine. But don't take Stone's film as the gospel truth. If you decide to see it (by now most probably in DVD) always bear in mind that this is a fictional work of art, and that Stone is on record as having his own agenda.<br/><br/>But what of JFK as a film? Well, if it is possible to divorce the 'film' from its contentious subject matter ‚Äì which is, of course, almost impossible ‚Äì then JFK should get very good marks indeed. It is well-shot, well-acted, well-edited and well-imagined. Had it dealt with some other assassination, and one which was not as central to a sensitive American psyche, it would be top-notch. As it is ¬Ö well until and when JFK can be views with a little more objectivity, it is almost impossible to judge.<br/><br/>Remember: this is a fictional piece of art. It isn't The Truth, irrespective of how close or how far from The Truth it actually might be."
"druss44121-1","9","1","9","5 April 2011"," Why I think this film is brilliant
","I don't know how much Oliver Stone believed what he showed in this film, but from his claims it's quite a bit. Yet, to me, that's really beside the point, especially since no one with any self respect should ever take any single source as gospel. This film is great because it's not just ABOUT a conspiracy, but it's about why conspiracy's are so fascinating, and why people like to believe in them. The simple answer is they make great stories. I mean, pretend for a second that JFK was a fictional film... exact same film, except nothing was based on actual people. It'd be rightly seen as a brilliant thriller full of plot twist after plot twist.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of black humor in the film I think people miss as they huff and puff about this and that. Personally, do I believe JFK's death was done by the US government as an internal coup from one ideology to another to help jumpstart the Vietnam war and also help line the pockets of companies that build military equipment? No... but it makes a great story. And I find it easier to watch this kinda story, too, when the ""official"" story makes no sense. Obviously something was going on. The most reasonable ""theories"" usually deal with some mob connections and a small but powerful group of people behind the assassination. Not a massive governmental conspiracy, but also not just one lone guy. But JFK goes beyond that as a film, and it really represents to me WHY conspiracy theories are so attractive (and why, when things don't add up, we automatically start connecting the dots in the most extreme ways. Foul play may be involved, but not to the level we sometimes wish it was involved).<br/><br/>There's one other film that does this.... Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Another film where people try to claim it's outing the Illuminati or whatever, but that's really not the point of the film at all. In Eyes Wide Shut, we see a man who has lost the passion for life because there is no conflict in his life, so he goes looking for it. It parallels human's need for excitement and challenge with the same needs in marriage and sex, but JFK and EWS go together for me as two sides of the same coin. Different tones and structure, but both are about - beyond everything else - why the idea of conspiracies are attractive, and ultimately, why storytelling can be such a powerful force. Because after all, in the end all a conspiracy theory is is, well, a tall tale."
"Pycs","10","1","10","13 June 2011"," A Masterpiece that Ages Like Wine
","This is it. JFK. Oliver's Stone masterpiece. Possibly the best work from a filmmaker who already has a track record of greatness. This needs to be mandatory viewing in every high school and extremely mandatory for anyone seeking a career in filmmaking of any department.<br/><br/>From the opening montages presenting the back story in a rapid fire manner, JFK doesn't waste a second. And yet, somehow manages to take it's time to play out in an easily understandable, yet highly intelligible fashion. The pacing is benchmark quality for cinema, maybe the best pacing in a movie since Raging Bull.<br/><br/>The performances are all finely tuned. It's very hard to believe that only Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for an Academy Award in an acting category for the film. Kevin Costner turns in what is most likely his best screen performance as a man obsessed with the past, so much so that it is tearing his family apart. Joe Pesci SHOULD have been nominated for best supporting actor with Jones, he's just that electric in the short screen time he has. The late great John Candy turns up for a brief cameo that could of been played off as laughable, but he comes across in a serious way. Movie icons Walter Mathieu and Jack Lemmon were great additions that only help to make the film reach immortal status. And not forgetting Donald Sutherland, 'X,' who provides Jim Garrison (Costner)with a pivotal back story told masterfully. Kevin Bacon shows up to as a male prostitute, a man who has been deep inside the mysterious world due to his nature. The only major female role is Garrison's wife, played by Sissy Spacek, as a woman on the brink of losing due to her husband's constant absence.<br/><br/>I don't know any other way of convincing you to see this gem. The black and white photography stands next to Schindler's List and Raging Bull. The script is top of the line quality, as is the cinematography. You may disagree with the history, but if you go in with an open mind, at least you'll have food for thought."

","JFK is an astounding achievement. Stone has taken unbelievably dense, complicated, intricate webs - not merely one - but many - of conspiracy and deceit, and woven them into an ultimate truth. Even if there are some factual errors in the movie, the bottom line conclusion is powerfully and impeccably made - that Kennedy, and probably RFK and MLK, were murdered by powerful, highly placed monied interests in the US government who stood to lose unimaginable amounts of money (and corresponding power) if these men effectively directed our country towards peace rather than war. Whatever specific theory you believe (unless you believe the ridiculous Warren Commission report), the bottom line always comes down to the same conclusion....murder for money and power.<br/><br/>The movie is flawlessly done.

","I will start by saying that I am not sure what exactly the truth is about the assassination of JFK. There are many theories and many conspiracy theories and tons of inaccuracies & probably some cover-ups as well. I will say that I am not a conspiracy nut like all of those that think we didn't land on the moon, (those that believe otherwise well I'm sorry you are just ignorant, try studying history please) that the Holocaust didn't happen, & that 9/11 was somehow caused by something other than terrorists. I do believe that just like this excellent film says there were perhaps other people and things that caused the killing of JFK. I consider myself a very well read historian (especially WWII) and of all of the big events that have happened in history, I am most unsure about the ACTUAL truth about JFK. Just as Oliver Stone says in this overlong film, he has some pretty ridiculous & extremely far-fetched ideas, but he also has some excellent points & just how bad the investigation was & how quickly just 1 man was blamed for the death of the president. It seems very unlikely that Lee Harvey Oswald was solely responsible. It probably isn't true that Cuba had so much involvement into what happened, but it is very interesting that Oswald himself was killed by Jack Ruby before he could speak everything that he might have known. If you are a conspiracy nut and believe everything is a conspiracy well I guess you have to have something to live for & I'm sure you will think that Stone has everything correct in this mostly fictional but very well written and thought out movie. So enjoy this for what it is, but please form your own opinion & actually study the facts.

","The undersigned lived through Jim Garrison's trial against Clay Shaw in New Orleans and blames the prosecutor for irresponsibly having contributed to the failure to establish clear certainty about the conspiracy theory regarding President Kennedy's assassination.<br/><br/>Garrison created unreasonable and unwarranted expectations in regards to blame. For many years following the trial, further inquiries that would have put the matter to rest were discouraged. Understandably, the conspiracy theory remained dormant for decades. Indeed, director Oliver Stone, too young at the time of the assassination - and given his proclivity to denounce government and big business - was much too disinclined to be objective; therefore, it was not unexpected of him to present the story with Garrison as a martyr. In that regard, 'JFK' can be regarded as unreliable and, indeed, dangerous history. The fact is, however, that 'JFK' should be appreciated primarily as a sophisticated, complex and masterful three-hour narrative which few contemporary filmmakers (with the possible exception of Milos Forman and Martin Scorcese) could have accomplished with equal skill. No character is superfluous, the casting, flawless, the pacing and editing, both impeccable. Set aside our shared reservations regarding Stone's political inclinations and, cinematically, 'JFK' will stand alongside 'Triumph of the Will'."
"gwailo247","8","1","11","25 February 2006"," Inspired by true events
","Some movies make the statement they are based on true events. Others claim the title to be inspired by true events. Stone attempts to do the former, but ends up doing the latter. <br/><br/>This is a good movie. An idealistic man tried to unravel the conspiracy of the assassination of a president, and ends up being thwarted by the conspirators at every step as they cover up their tracks. Stone is a very good director and this movie is no exception. The historical accuracy of this film has been debated by very knowledgeable and passionate people, and I've read enough to find its credibility lacking, so I am judging this movie as a work of historical fiction - inspired by true events. <br/><br/>The death of JFK was taken as a shattering of the myth of Camelot, the end of the 20 years after WW2 when America reigned supreme and basked under the sun of its military and economic might. Stone plays upon this sentiment very well, presenting us with a series of ""what if's"" focusing on what would happen if JFK had lives. An idyllic utopia in which there was no Vietnam, where civil rights miraculously spread across the land, and several other unrealistic, but very appealing notions. As a Vietnam veteran, one can understand Stone's passion in making this movie. Its rather obvious that he associates the death of JFK with the start of events that led him to a series of unpleasant events in his life. Just as one mourns the death of a child because of the potential and hopes of the future, so we mourn the death of JFK based on notions of what could have been. Whether or not JFK could have accomplished these things is another matter, but we can hold this belief inside that had he lived things would have been better. <br/><br/>Stone plays for his audience and his time very well. The Cold War had just ended, and we no longer needed the same government that kept the Evil Empire at bay. Documents became declassified, and there was an overall backlash against the shadowy government - X-files, alien autopsy reports, etc. It was not difficult for Stone to feed upon this climate of distrust of the government in presenting his conclusions in a very appealing manner. There is no proof because the conspirators destroyed the truth. For a public just finding out a lot of the things that its government did during the Cold War that was subsequently kept quiet, the killing and cover-up of a president seemed very realistic. <br/><br/>As a piece of storytelling, this movie is great. It sucks you in and keeps going at a mounting pace until its eventual climax where all is revealed, and nothing is proved. As a piece of political propaganda its a masterpiece, and should be studied by every filmmaker and politician as how to take disjointed facts and coincidences and twist them together to paint a compelling story that the public would love to swallow up. <br/><br/>Did these events happen as shown on the screen? Its possible. Stone himself admits he took dramatic license in several events, which, if you are trying to show a factual and historical story pretty much kills your credibility from the beginning. More and more time has passed for any one of this apparent legion of conspirators to come forth and make a deathbed confession, and so the veil of conspiracy and cover-up wears thinner and thinner with each passing day. Surely Cancer Man must be getting tired eliminating witness after witness, document after document. <br/><br/>Watch the movie, think about it. There is plenty more to learn about what happened outside the movie, the JFK movie board itself, and the links provided in and of themselves will provide you with more information that you can imagine. But in the end, this is just a movie - inspired by true events."

","Regardless of how much is fact and how much is fiction, this is an engrossing and enthralling political thriller, expertly shot and brilliantly edited, combining movie footage, photographs and drawings, as well as a whole lot more. The ensemble cast behind the film is amazing: full of Oscar winners and acclaimed performers, all who deliver well. The only striking flaw in the film is the pacing. It feels far too rushed and far too speedily put together, considering the heaviness of the content. The film could have actually done with a four hour running time, as this would not only slow the film to a better pace, but it would allow some room for a study into obsession - a theme that feels neglected in all the excitement. This is a gripping piece of cinema as it is, but there is some room for improvement."

Oliver Stone is a brilliant, albeit controversial filmmaker. This is indeed a film that should be viewed by all...in fact, do some reading first, or check out the DVD box set ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" . It is a prelude to the Costner starred film, and will give you decent background on a lot of things. <br/><br/>I have viewed ""JFK"" more times than I can count. For me, it never gets old.

"Doylenf","Null","1","11","26 November 2003"," Speculative but riveting...superb story-telling...
","Conspiracy theories get a workout in Oliver Stone's JFK--he has hit upon every conceivable theory, every point and counterpoint to be made and has produced an absorbing, involving, and ultimately entertaining film that makes you think about which theory you believe is the likeliest. And he has a cast that brings every important character to life, even though the physical resemblances are not always there. <br/><br/>KEVIN COSTNER, for example, is excellent as the doggedly determined D.A. Jim Garrison (but looks nothing like the real Jim Garrison) who will leave no stone unturned in his effort to find the truth behind the killing of JFK--even if it means ignoring his wife and family while he pursues justice. Costner uses his Honest Abe image to give the sort of heartfelt, man-of-integrity intensity that James Stewart and Henry Fonda might have given in their day. He is made to seem like a towering figure of integrity in the script Stone has written from Jim Garrison's point of view--almost like Atticus Finch resurrected, especially in his closing courtroom speech. Was the real Jim Garrison really this noble?<br/><br/>As a note of irony, Stone has the real Jim Garrison playing Earl Warren and defending the Warren Commission Report with a straight face.<br/><br/>Other roles are played with equal validity by Tommy Lee Jones (as Clay Shaw), Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Ed Asner (infuriating as Guy Bannister), and Joe Pesci as David Ferrie. Pesci is a bit over the top as David Ferrie (and gets on the nerves) but that's the way the role was written and directed.<br/><br/>But the most remarkable moments in the film are provided by the exchange of information between Kevin Costner and Donald Sutherland as the extent of the conspiracy is revealed to come from higher places in the government. Sutherland gives an imposing performance, quietly restrained but chilling as he delivers his insider information.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. His face, voice and gestures are strikingly similar and blend well with actual footage of Oswald intermittently seen.<br/><br/>Altogether a very competent piece of filmmaking which fulfills its purpose by making the viewer think about what might actually have happened on that awful day in Dallas when the age of innocence officially ended in American politics. Whether it's the Mafia, Castro's Cubans, the FBI, the CIA or LBJ and the Pentagon (with the help of the Warren Commission), it's all there for you to sort out and ponder--perhaps until 2029 when some new suppressed evidence will eventually be released."

","""JFK"" has been controversial from the moment of its inception. Its director, Oliver Stone, has been reviled as a revisionist and heralded as a visionary.<br/><br/>
The film ""JFK"" seeks to vindicate Jim Garrison, the former DA of New Orleans, who wholeheartedly believed a conspiracy existed to kill President Kennedy, and to shut up anyone who came too close to ""the truth"".<br/><br/>If we could slake off all these years since 1963, or even 1991, we would see how drastically the average person's view has changed. The vast majority now believe that Kennedy's killing was the result of a conspiracy. Many think Oswald was framed, and some even think there were two or more guys answering to the name of Oswald.<br/><br/>""JFK"" has taken on an aura of ""fact"" to so many that passions can be aroused if one voices a dissenting opinion in the wrong company. Not a lot of films have had the kind of impact. On the bonus side, the film JFK helped to get documents released which would have been kept from the public for 75 years after the assassination. These documents, a veritable mountain of them, are available to the public in varying degrees.<br/><br/>In 1991 things seemed more black and white. <br/><br/>Did I believe in a conspiracy then? It is hard to recall. Do I believe in one now? Yes. I believe that a conspiracy exists, on the Internet, in books and in the media, to present such an information overload that ""we"" allow the ""experts"" to feed us their Cliff Notes version of the 1963 events. They eat, digest, and we swallow.<br/><br/>The web's minutia of everything Kennedy is mind boggling. Every point has a counterpoint. Every truth has a lie. Every ass gets to bray, and we are left to sort it out. You must make up your own mind on this movie and on the events that spawned it. For my part, the jury is still out. I tend to follow Occam's Razor, but research for this review has left me battered and reeling, and just as confused as anybody."
"eddy-28","Null","1","11","19 October 2003"," An important motion picture for those who demand the truth.
","One of my favorite real mystery thrillers about who actually shot President John F. Kennedy. Oliver Stone directed this wonderfully crafted and creative look about the long list of suspects involved on that day back in November of 1963. Kevin Costner plays real life district attorney Jim Garrison who heads his own investigation into finding what the reason was for murdering the great President and who really did it, was it really Lee Harvey Oswald?, or was it the mafia, CIA, Russians, Cubans or our own US Government? We might never know, but as American people, we demand the truth. Gary Oldman plays Lee Harvey Oswald excellently, it's almost as if the real Oswald was 'resurrected' sort of speak, I was amazed on how much similarity there was between Oldman and Oswald. Tommy Lee Jones (who recieved a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination) plays the New Orleans openly gay albino Clay Shaw who is also accused of ploting to kill Kennedy while Joe Pesci turns in a fine role as the crazy David Ferrie who also seems to be involved. The film includes an all-star cast including Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Jay O. Sanders and Vincent D'Onofrio as well as surprising and effective five to ten minute cameos by Kevin Bacon, John Candy, Edward Asner, Sally Kirkland, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland and Brian Doyle Murray who also turns in an excellent role as night club owner Jack Ruby, the notorious man who eventually murdered Oswald. Although I wasn't alive when Kennedy was shot, I enjoyed the film because it gives people who weren't around hope and dignity to find the truth. As a result of this film, Congress passed documents that such case files as the assasination of JFK could be avialible to the American public in the year 2029. Every time I watch this film, I can see the heartbreak and tragedy of the American people who watched a great leader like JFK being shot, but maybe one day, the real truth will be out and I think that is something that JFK would want the American people to know."

During my initial viewing there was a lot of information to process and at times it felt as if the characters were not interacting as human beings but merely spouting facts for the benefit of the audience. Stone himself says in the DVD interview that he wished he could've included an intermission. Nevertheless this film is so relevant beyond the facets of mere filmmaking (by the way the performances and direction are top notch as would be expected). Beyond even the question of JFK's assassination, the film examines the very checks and balances that allow for the existence of the American Republic (""not an empire"" as Pat Buchanan correctly points out).

"mwax1213","8","1","11","21 January 2003"," Movie Good, Facts A Tad Off (But Not Totally)
","As strictly a film, JFK is pretty much a hit. Oliver Stone is pretty much a director I can live without, but this was definitely a hit. He took a solid premise and ran with it, intertwining authentic video with re-creations. Of course, being Oliver Stone, he definitely used some embellishment for ""art's sake"", but that came off as heavy handed and quite unnecessary. For instance, the Clay Shaw character, while well-played by Tommy Lee Jones, really was nothing more than a red herring. He had nothing, repeat, nothing to do with the assassination, and was merely put in there as a foil for Jim Garrison. Kevin Costner plays Garrison ably enough, though there really aren't many layers to the man. Come to think of it, maybe that's why the part was perfect for Costner! While the movie is overly long (it could have been trimmed by about 40 minutes), two parts stand out and are must-see moviemaking -- the exchange between Garrison and Mr. X (Donald Sutherland)explaining the backdrop and set-up of the assassination, and the climactic, heart-pounding courtroom scene. Even if you have no knowledge of the case, the courtroom scene especially is one of the most gripping pieces of cinema you'll ever see. The acting is outstanding, especially Gary Oldman as Oswald, and the cinematography definitely gives you the feeling you're back in 1963.<br/><br/>As a fact-finding mission, which Stone purports that is, the movie fails on a few -- but not all -- levels. His habit of filming things documentary style gives rise to the belief that this is indeed a documentary, when it's anything but. He also has so many wild scenarios and plots that, even though one is very close to the truth, the viewer is compelled to dismiss most. You don't know which one to believe. When doing a film of this magnitude, Stone could have done a much better job had he gone with one premise and stuck with it. While rightly showing that Oswald was not and could not have been the assassin, he does little to put together anything coherent as to what actually happened. He ventures closest to the truth in the aforementioned scene between Sutherland and Costner, which implicates the military structure of the United States. Some of it is fabrication, but much of it hits very, very close to the truth. The simple fact of the matter is that the military machine was worried that Kennedy would disarm and pull out of Vietnam, and they didn't want that. So they did something about it.<br/><br/>For those folks who have recommended Posner's ""Case Closed"" as the definitive work on this subject, let me suggest anything by Harold Weisberg, David Lifton, Mark Lane, or, especially, ""Assassination Science"" and ""What We Know Now That We Didn't Know Then"", both by James Fetser. They will show that Posner's book is not only a fabrication, but like the Warren Commission before it a document that worked backward -- it had a conclusion in mind and set out to prove it, dismissing witnesses and interviews that said otherwise.<br/><br/>Really, if you want to learn about the doctored autopsy photos, the doctored X-rays, the fact that much of the Zapruder film isn't authentic, the bullet count, the impossibility of Oswald as the shooter and more of the TRUTH about the Kennedy assassination, check out the titles above. And yes, I do own ""Case Closed."" It's one of the funnier books I've had the pleasure to read.<br/><br/>Open your mind and figure things out on your own. Don't buy into the government's cut-and-dried response on this case. After all, that same government is most likely the one that took this leader away. I'd recommend the movie, though, for the reasons stated above and because it is likely to spur debate and make you think. And isn't that what good moviemaking is about?"

","I hadn't yet been born when John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas. I cannot put the actual event into an emotional context in my life. Further to that, I am Canadian, and could theoretically distance myself from such an ugly piece of American history. Yet I cannot help but be emotionally affected by this film.<br/><br/>The unraveling conspiracy in ""JFK"" is told with such conviction, it's hard to believe that it's only a culmination of theories and accounts rather than the truth as is known in history books. The length of the film in its DVD format is 206 minutes, a veritable film marathon. Yet with it's richness in information, theories and background, and absolutely beautiful photography by Robert Richardson, the time never passes slowly. And despite having watched it at least twice, I can safely say that the mind boggling conspiracies and facts they throw at you could keep it fresh for a third viewing in the future.<br/><br/>The emotional impact of the 8mm Zapruder film which recorded the assassination, is staggering and awe inspiring. The feeling that the American government plotted the death of their own president, illustrates in many ways time and again, as one of the smaller characters reflects, that if they can kill the president, they can kill anyone. They can kill you or I without batting an eye.<br/><br/>I can however, despite the seriousness of the subject matter, share a rather amusing anecdote about my first viewing of this film. I hadn't seen it in theaters, and so I rented it on VHS. My mother wanted to watch it with me, and knowing that it was over three hours long, she was eager to begin, complaining that she didn't want to be up until midnight watching it. Popping the microwave popcorn, she warned me she was starting without me if I didn't hurry. When I came in the room it had already begun. ""Jeez, Mom! What'd I miss?"", ""Nothing, quiet!"" We watched the film together, at times my mother would comment on things that she recalled, and I'd have the occasion to ask her to be quiet. Half an hour went by, with not so much as one credit having shown on the screen, I remarked on it, and my mother concurred that it was odd, but confirmed that I truly hadn't missed anything walking into the film late.<br/><br/>Soon we came to the speech given by Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison in the court room, charging Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw as a conspirator, which is a scene that is quite emotionally stirring and powerful. I thought it was incredible. I had noticed that we'd barely crossed the half way mark of the three hour adventure, and remarked, ""Wow, you know, you could end the film right there, that was pretty powerful."" ""Yes, it was,"" my mother agreed. Shortly following that scene came the epilogue statements and end credits. Finally it dawned on me. ""Mom! You put the SECOND tape in FIRST!"" She laughed immediately. We both did, but I was pretty upset knowing now that I'd have to start tape one and follow it up with tape two again. She got her wish, she wasn't up until midnight, not feeling the slightest bit compelled to watch the first tape, proclaiming, ""I lived it, I don't need to see it again, good night dear."" Well Mom, you should watch the first part anyway, whether you lived it or not, because it's pretty darn intriguing. Unfortunately, the DVD isn't Mom-proof either, as it is double-sided."

","JFK is a film about the assassination of John F. Kennedy and it's aftermath. The film follows Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), a New Orleans District Attorney, who believed that the assassination was not invested properly and that Lee Harvey Oswald was not working alone. Garrison starts he investigations after the Warren Commission publishes its report and starts to investigate a number of people, questions people from prisoners and witnesses and test the theories behind the assassination. Garrison also meets up and gets information from a mysterious military figure (Donald Sutherland). Garrison ends up getting the police to arrest a local man, Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), and puts him on trial for conspiracy to murder. He was the only man ever be trialled for the Kennedy assassination.<br/><br/>The film was well researched and written. It looks at the theories and try to prove or debunk them. The story was told in flashbacks which was fitting and told Oliver Stone uses a number of film devises such as real news footage, black-and-white films, a washed-out colour look and normal film. The film has some good acting performances, it was Kevin Costner's best and this is his best film. There also a good large cast, from Tommy Lee Jones to Gary Oldman to Joe Pesci. The film also has a narrated beginning showing the history of the events and subtly sets out Stone's theory.<br/><br/>This film however is not history, but a mix of historical fact and fiction. The theory in this film was that the American Government and Military, including Lyndon B. Johnson, ordered the assassination of Kennedy because they thought he was weak against Communism and wanted to withdraw troops from Vietnam before the war could escalate. This theory is too far fetched and most historians, including American and Cold War specialists at my university believed that American would have gone into Vietnam no matter who was President, Kennedy or Johnson. The film also makes out that Lee Harvey Oswald was a sleeper agent being trained by the American military and was faking being a Marxist and pro-Castro figure.<br/><br/>I believe the lone nut theory, that Lee Harvey Oswald was just working on his own. The wouldn't of been involvement of anyone else, not the US government, the Russians, Cubans, Mafia, etc. A general problem of society is that there are always going to be people who believe conspiracy theories.

","I rented JFK because I wanted to see it again in the context of knowing what I know about 9/11. There are remarkable parallels between the Kennedy assassination and 9/11 in that both appear to be false-flag operations that misdirect the public in another direction. It is almost as though they are both based on chapter 3 of the CIA handbook for Black Ops. As for ""factual errors"" that are being referenced by some reviewers, one thing always associated with black ops is a psy-war effort to attempt to throw fog and false leads into anyone who would pursue the truth. It is done so that the average viewer will give up in confusion, perhaps not buying the ""official"" story, but neither giving complete credence to the alternatives. I have to say that I was disappointed by JFK when it was first released. At that time, I thought Oliver Stone was a propaganda artist. I must say his version has held up over time much better than the Warren Commission, which is a laughing stock now. In the context of 9/11, JFK is positively chilling. Costner's speeches at the end ring loud and clear and he could as easily been talking about 9/11 as JFK. When Costner talks about LBJ getting Brown and Root a Billion-dollar contract for dredging Cam Ranh Bay, my hair stood on end. I was in Vietnam in 1968, lost some friends there. Now with a Kellog added, Halliburton's ""lucky"" subsidiary is still raking in billions in war profits for that most connected of companies, but it is more blatant than ever. Ike's warning has come true with a vengeance. Split hairs all you want about the facts in this movie, it has an important message that resonates more today than it ever could 16 years ago."

People really can't keep their mouths shut for 10 minutes; but we are to believe that all these people were involved, and all of them kept quiet, all these years. Kevin Costner turns in one of his dull as watching paint dry performances. Sissy Spacek gives the only believable performance, and her character is totally useless.  The whole film is so over-the-top, that whatever point Oliver Stone was trying to make, gets lost in the clutter.  Not recommended!"
"tommx","Null","1","12","20 September 2000"," This movie is not what it seems.
","The interesting thing about this film to me is not so much the conspiracy theories that it cites, but rather its portrayal of Jim Garrison.  I myself am not a proponent of any of the conspiracy theories cited in this film. I tend to regard them in the same way I regard urban legends or sightings of Elvis.  However, the films account of Jim Garrison's activities in relation to the trial of Clay Shaw is definitely of interest to me.<br/><br/>Having read Garrison's book, `On the Trail of the Assassins' and various other accounts of the JFK assassination, I find that the movie only serves to support my belief that Garrison's case against Clay Shaw was utter fiction.  There really wasn't anything even remotely resembling hard evidence that Clay Shaw had anything to do with the JFK assassination. There are indications, however, that Garrison probably singled Shaw out because of his homosexuality.  It's pretty well documented that Garrison was homophobic and this is even referenced in the movie when his wife cites it as the reason Garrison is going after Clay Shaw.  In fact, in his interview with Shaw in the movie, he puts Shaw on the spot for hiring a male prostitute before he even mentions Lee Harvey Oswald.  (The character played by Kevin Bacon in this film is fictional by the way.  There was no Willie O'Keefe) What bearing does Shaw's homosexuality have on the Kennedy assassination?  You tell me!  Another thing you notice in the movie is that Garrison's witnesses all seem to be from the bottom layer of society.  In real life, his only real witness (if you can call him that) was a man called Perry Russo whose deposition was initially taken under the influence of sodium pentathol.  Until then, Russo never even mentioned knowing Clay Shaw, and the name he gave, Clay Bertrand, was used by Garrison as evidence of Shaw's guilt.  (There was never any hard evidence that Shaw ever used that alias, although Garrison insists that it was given by Shaw when he was arrested) The point is, the more you know factually about Garrison, the more the film shows him not to be some kind of Shakespearian hero, but rather a corrupt and paranoid man with extreme charisma.  It's also worth noting that if Clay Shaw hadn't died of cancer (not mysteriously as the film suggests) he'd have probably won the civil lawsuit he'd brought against Garrison for wrongful persecution.  It's also worth mentioning that Shaw was financially broken by the legal expenses involved in defending himself against Garrison's lawsuit.  The film makes no mention of this, of course as it would not serve Stone's ends to make a documentary about how Garrison effectively ruined Shaw's life.<br/><br/>The frustrating thing about this movie is that since it is cinematically well crafted, and the performances are compelling, it is also grossly misleading.  Aside from making Garrison into a hero, it makes Oswald look like some kind of complex character straight out of the Manchurian Candidate.  (A movie I'm sure Stone loved...I certainly did.)  Oswald was a bitter little man who wanted to be a big man.  I saw no indications of this in the film.  Costner's portrayal of Garrison was actually more accurate than I expected as it gives indications of all the aspects of his character I've cited above.<br/><br/>I'd say if you don't know a lot about the Kennedy assassination, read up on it before you subject yourself to this movie.  In spite of it's implausible theories, it can convince the uninformed of some very inaccurate things."
"mogens_h√∏egsberg","8","1","12","4 December 1999"," Important movie, but a movie, nonetheless
","JFK is probably one of the most important movies to have come out in a long time. Not because it tells the truth of the Kennedy-assassination (who can purport to do that?), but because it alerts people to the mysteries surrounding the murder of JFK. The movie cannot be said to tell a true story; indeed the weaving together of fact and fiction is a dangerous path, because some people may believe that the movie is *the* truth. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, for people who are aware of the problems concerning the investigation into Kennedy's assassination, the film is an interesting summing-up of the major theories, concerning the reasons for and perpetrators of Kennedy's murder. Sometimes the movie does go a bit overboard (the implication of LBJ to me seems to be unfounded), but overall it remains quite truthful to most of the theories. <br/><br/>Personally I believe that Kennedy was the victim of assassination. I've done quite a bit of reading on the subject, and far from being able to tell ""the truth"", I do believe that Jim Garrison was onto something, and the Garrison-theories still seem to me like the most likely.<br/><br/>
For people who are aware of the ethical problems of weaving together documentary footage and fictional film as Stone does, JFK is a great movie to sum up the major theories about the Kennedy-assassination. For those who aren't aware of these problems, the movie is dangerous in its manipulation of ""the truth""."
"YodaFan-2","Null","1","12","29 June 1999"," One of the best films-period
","I've got to say that this is truly my second favorite movie of all time (with the first being Silence of the Lambs).  I was initially attracted to it because it is a ""period film""-typical of Oliver Stone-and because I am a fan of his other work (Loved Born of the Fourth of July also) I was not disappointed in any way-this film was brilliant.  The characters are very three-dimensional. Even if you aren't a ""conspiracy buff"", this is a very, very believable movie.<br/><br/>Are some of the conclusions far-fetched? Is the story a bit one-sided? Perhaps. Stone is famous for that. This was one assassination-I don't believe that the Mob, LBJ, the anti-Communists, and the pro-Vietnam people could have all have Kennedy snuffed out. But you have to admit that this movie makes you THINK, which is kind of rare these days.<br/><br/>The events are told in a very effective method-the beginning with Walter Cronkite is great.  Costner is superb as Garrison, and I absolutely loved all the ""cameos""-Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner,Kevin Bacon-geez, I could probably make a shorter list of who is NOT in this movie. My favorites are Joe Pesci's character and Donald Sutherland, who is always good as mysterious-too bad that Fletcher Prouty (the supposed ""real"" Mr. X) couldn't have shed some more light on the role of this character in the whole ""conspiracy theory"" in his book.  Hats off as well to Gary Oldman-no one else could have done Oswald and gotten away with it like he did.<br/><br/>After watching this for the first time (in the theater), I have read almost all of the books that Stone used to make this film. Although most of the story is written from Garrison's ""On the Trail of the Assassins"" and Jim Marrs'book, you can definitely see that Stone did his homework on this one.<br/><br/>I think that every American should see this film at least once. This is an absolutely facinating movie-you will not be the same after seeing it, I guarantee. Like I said before, whether you believe the story or not, it makes you think."
"Mark41251","Null","1","12","4 September 2002"," Technically good but.......
","Having read very little about the Kennedy assasination before watching JFK, this film achieved its goal in getting me interested in the subject. Oliver Stone's blending of archival footage within the movie really gives the film an authentic semi-documentary style that makes his depiction of events very persuasive. Luckily for me I spent the next several weeks reading up on the assasination as otherwise I would have believed the paranoid rantings of Oliver Stone where in fact the truth. His portrayal of Jim Garrison (who actually accused Robert Kennedy of being an accessory after the fact of his own brother's murder) is wrong on so many levels and makes Oliver Stone look foolish in documenting his illogical theories.<br/><br/>Some people say that Oliver Stone was courageous in making this movie, I believe he took the easy way out. Since the majority of people  a) believe there was a conspiracy or  b) want to believe there was a conspiracy, pandering to these beliefs with a fictional account of a conspiracy of the grandest of scales is not the hallmark of a brave man. Making a big-budget movie that portrayed Oswald as a lone gunman would have been truly courageous."

","The assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963 probably ranks as the darkest day in American 20th century history. What makes it particularly sad is that nowhere near all the details about his murder have ever been released to the public.<br/><br/>Before Oliver Stone ever came out with ""JFK"" the movie, few people believed the Warren Commission's claim that Lee Harvey Oswald acted killed Kennedy on his own volition.  There was also a good case to be made that Oswald was nothing more than a patsy in a very devious conspiracy, and that he didn't even do it.  Note that all of this was BEFORE the release of ""JFK.""  The firestorm of controversy the film created only served to add to the debate.<br/><br/>Stone's epic, 205-minute movie, which details the efforts of New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) to unravel at least a part of the conspiracy by trying to tie in local business magnate Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) to it, levels some pretty heavy judgments against those who would cling to the Oswald-did-it-alone-theory.  Not all of the theories that Stone espouses here are believable, but a number of scenarios are raised that could very easily have happened in reality.  Was JFK's murder possibly even an elaborate coup d'etat, a theory raised by Mr. X (Donald Sutherland)?  Was Kennedy actually trying to end the Cold War while in office, putting the military/industrial complex in fear for its very existence?  Would he have halted America's involvement in Vietnam?<br/><br/>All the questions and theories get a thorough going-over.  Nobody's going to mistake ""JFK"" for a documentary, to be sure.  And certainly there will always be apologists for the Warren Commission, like Gerald Posner, even as its theories have credibility holes big enough to drive a truck through. But in the end, ""JFK"" is riveting filmmaking pure and simple, well worthy of the Oscars it got for cinematography and editing.  And get a load of the people Stone put into his film: Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Sissy Spacek, Sally Kirkland, Walter Matthau, Kevin Bacon, Ed Asner.<br/><br/>With all of this, Stone, like Stanley Kubrick, made a film that started people talking...and one that they're STILL talking about after ten years.

","Before getting into the body of this work, let me warn the reader that all that follows is just one person's evaluation of Oliver Stone's JFK. It is just opinion, which you may find agreement, or you may reject. Likewise, Mr. Stone should have had the honesty to provide a disclaimer warning the viewer to beware of suppositions, conjecture and fantasizing.<br/><br/>Like any Catholic, American schoolboy of Irish descent, at 14 years of age in 1960, I was very proud to see the Gentleman from Massachusetts, Senator John F. Kennedy win the Democrat Party's nomination and subsequent election to the Office of President. Little did we know that it would be just a little more than 3 years later that we would bear witness to his murder.<br/><br/>And even though in the interim between the 2 events, I found myself steadily changing my Political Sympathies. My born and bred Democrat leanings gave way to a solid belief and active Conservative Political participation. That is to whatever small participation allowed to by a guy my age. I would be 18 at the time of the 1964 Presidential Election, at a period of time when one had to be 21 in order to vote.<br/><br/>Anyway, even though this young Irish-German, Catholic lad was now a supporter of Senator Barry M. Goldwater(R., AZ) for the Chief Executive job, I. like most Americans, felt as if some one had kicked the living guts right out of me when President Kennedy was murdered. The events of that fateful day and the days following, left America with such a feeling of Personal as well as National tragedy, loss and grief. It was as if a member of one's own family was suddenly, and without any logical reason,taken from life on Planet Earth.This is a feeling that is quite prevalent across the board for all living and old enough to remember those days.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of people of my own Conservative Political persuasion, I do reject the finding of the Warren Commission. Whereas I do not buy the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin of President Kennedy, and did so by himself. There is just too much that does not compute! It made no sense then, it makes no sense now! In the years since that time in ""Camelot"", I've spent most of my adult life as 'the Man', 'the Heat', 'the Fuzz', well you get it, I was a Chicago Cop for nearly 35 years, having experience in assignment=ts to the Patrol Division, the Traffic Division, the Youth Division and finally the Detective Division. This surely acted to heighten my sense of suspicion and cynicism about current events, the media covering them and how some special interests can and do slant a story to read as they want it. (Honest Injun! Don't be Shocked, Please!!) Now in spite of all of this disbelief in the findings of the Warren Commission and discounting all the other writings that have sprouted up like mushrooms after a thunderstorm, I must register a negative opinion of JFK and will be happy to give my reasons as to just why.<br/><br/>First of all, let's start off by saying, without reservation, that JFK is a tremendous example of the exposition of the Cinematic Arts & Sciences at their very zenith of their powers. The photography, the editing, the use of nonsequitors is all so very well done as to draw the viewer into the story right from the very start. Cutting quickly between scenes and overlapping dialog adds to the certain feeling of ""reality"". Furthering this realism is the use of certain scenes which quickly follow a revelation or supposition* of a behind the scenes happening. These 'follow-up', supporting scenes, are often filmed in a diminished color, or a B & W with a dark-shadowed background. The dialog is spoken in short, fast-paced little clips in voices impersonating a well-known person involved in the whole mess.(e.g. Lyndon Johnson) This is then blurred with overlapping dialog from the previous ex positional scene. All tension is heightened by using abrupt, shrill and louder musical queues.<br/><br/>The result is very effective as a dramatic tool, but can be very deceiving to the senses, unconsciously gaining influence on the very last part of one's thought process to fall to sensory stimulation and mood manipulation, your logic. In a real sense, a story like this actually mesmerizes the viewer. That is it has a hypnotic effect.<br/><br/>As a work of monumental effort and mammoth efforts in the story telling tradition of the cinema, this certainly deserving of an A or even an A+ grade.<br/><br/>But we find that there is just too much of a recurring use of innuendo, supposition, conjecture and embellishment of occurrences following the assassination. The Film Maker, Extremist Left Wing Liberal Democrat, Director Oliver Stone, bends the truth just once too often and a little too much. For these reasons, this writer cannot and will not, endorse this movie. The sum of all the contrived scenes, stacked on on top another equals just a dishonest instrument of influence.<br/><br/>And here in Chicago, and just about anywhere else, that means it's a F*cking lie! We surely could not endorse that! Could you?"

","Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Oliver Stone was naturally the perfect choice for this magnificent film focusing on one of the most devastating events in American political history, and I had to watch it. The film opens with narration by Martin Sheen about the life of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, leading from 1961 till November 22nd 1963 when he was shockingly shot and killed. The story, made up from both fact and opinion, sees District Attorney Jim Garrison (Golden Globe nominated Kevin Costner) return after three years since the incident to find who was responsible in as many fields of the murder as possible. He interviews all people who were connected to the key suspect, also murdered, Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman), including David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), Jack Martin (Jack Lemmon), Senator Long (Walter Matthau), Dean Andrews (John Candy), Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon) and X (Donald Sutherland). All these witnesses lead Garrison to charging Clay Shaw (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Tommy Lee Jones) with strong connection to the assassination, and he is preparing to have a hopeful conclusion made in a trial. This investigation is putting strain on Garrison's relationship with wife Liz (Sissy Spacek) and their kids, but he is determined to have justice brought to America with his passion for the terrible event. In the end, Shaw was found not guilty, and according to the end text, Garrison continued to try and find the truth, and apparently true facts of Kennedy's assassination will be revealed by the year 2027. Also starring Jay O. Sanders as Lou Ivon, Michael Rooker as Bill Broussard, Laurie Metcalf as Susie Cox, Gary Grubbs as Al Oser, Edward Asner as Guy Bannister, Brian Doyle-Murray as Jack Ruby, Sally Kirkland as Rose Cheramie, Beata Pozniak as Marina Oswald, Vincent D'Onofrio as Bill Newman, the real Jim Garrison as Earl Warren, Wayne Knight as Numa Bertel, Tony Plana as Carlos Bringuier, Dale Dye as General Y and Bob Gunton as TV Newsman #3. It is unknown of course whether Oswald acted alone or as part of a team, but this film does make a very plausible account of events. With a fantastic cast list, terrific use of archive footage, not just of Kennedy, but also some Fidel Castro, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, this is a magnificent political thriller that I would definitely recommend. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Stone and Zachary Sklar and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

","It is true CIA was one of the participants. However, Vietnam was NOT the reason that Kennedy was killed. Oliver Stone got the cause and effect reversed--Escalation of Vietnam War was not THE cause of the Kennedy assassination, but one of (albeit THE major) effects of it. CIA (and in broader sense Mafia, which wouldn't have been able to act without CIA's sanction and coordination anyway)did not kill Kennedy for the reason Kennedy would take the money away from the Eisenhower 'military-industrial complex' but for the reason he had not only screwed CIA during the Bay of Pigs but also shifted his blame and planned to break it up into thousand pieces. In that sense Kennedy was a consummate son of a bitch, ingrate and dastardly.<br/><br/>At the time of his assassination Vietnam was only one of many 'Communist-threatened' areas of interest for the U.S. administration--it only became THE issue only after Johnson (who had had the knowledge of the plot all along and gave the final sanction at the Murchison meeting )became the president and put into action the escalation in Vietnam as a reward to the Texas Oil, ultra-right, 'military', and 'industrial' complex that helped him to power. Kennedy had sown the seed of Vietnam as compensation for his failure in Cuba--ultimately the fat cats reaped the harvest a the cost of millions of people dead and tens of billions of dollars in taxpayers' money in their pocket.

"cleary-joshua","8","0","7","5 June 2014"," Does ""JFK"" work as an interesting film, not just a politics lesson? Kind of...
","There are a lot of problems that can be faced when making deeply political movies. Filmmakers try to share their views on corrupt systems and political mistakes, but through this they ignore the one thing that is most essential in an interesting film - the plot. There's a fine line between a fascinating thriller and a politics lesson, and occasionally directors will fall on the wrong side of that line. This has never stopped Oliver Stone, however, who has now built up a reputation for dealing with tricky subject matters, such as the Vietnam War, 9/11 or various presidents, in his movies. Here, he tackles the topic of JFK's assassination in a 3 hour movie which addresses as many conspiracy theories that it can. Does it work? Kind of.<br/><br/>The movie follows Jim Garrison, played by Kevin Costner, the District Attorney of New Orleans who begins to look into the JFK assassination, since he is convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald could not have been the only killer. It begins by showing Kennedy's life just before his killing, through newsreel footage, building up to a reconstruction of the actual assassination. The film is intelligent in using this as exposition rather than a major plot point later, since it is such a familiar event, and we can then get right into the fallout. Various theories are debunked and brought up during the course of the film, including a scene where Garrison tests out whether it was actually possible for Oswald to have hit Kennedy from his supposed position at the time.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is mostly superb, with Costner being a likable lead who is also a powerful speaker. The speech that he gives during the court case right at the end is long, but he is a good enough orator that you focus on everything he says. Other great members of the cast include Tommy Lee Jones, playing Clay Shaw, a man accused of conspiring to kill Kennedy, Donald Sutherland, a man high up in Washington who suggests that the CIA had something to do with it, and Jack Lemmon. Kevin Bacon's performance seems like more of a caricature, and is slightly out of place in the film.<br/><br/>""JFK"" is a fascinating and often thrilling movie at its best points. But it tends to drag when interesting information is not being discovered, and there is no way that all of its 3 hour runtime is necessary. Certain parts feel gratuitous so that every theory is covered, and others are just a bit confusing. There is also the important question of whether it matters if everything in the film is factual. So long as audience members know that it is supposed to be a representation of possible events, rather than stone cold fact, then this does not matter that much, since it is interesting enough as a movie, and at no point claims to be a documentary.<br/><br/>If you're going to watch ""JFK"", know that you're in for the long haul, and that some parts of the film are not easy to get through because they do drag. However often Costner's performance alone is great enough that interest levels are maintained in the telling if a story which is still shrouded in so much mystery."

","""JFK"" is a brilliant film, particularly in the way it continually feeds us ""evidence"" and broadens the scope of the ""conspiracy"" to assassinate the president. For those of us who lived through those times, the movie also vividly captures the prevailing mood, including rabid anti-communists who thought JFK was a sellout to the reds and were glad he was shot. Having Garrison as a passive TV viewer while three assassinations took place--JFK, Dr. King, and RFK--was a vivid reminder to me of the bad old days.<br/><br/>There were also two really wonderful performances--Joe Pesci as David Ferrie and Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw--and good work too by Kevin Bacon. I found Kevin Costner to be wooden in the lead performance. Sissy Spacek had a thankless role as Garrison's wife, causing the film to stop dead while they had marital arguments.<br/><br/>The big problem with the movie is the proliferation of conspirators. They keep piling up as the movie moves along, until, during Garrison's summation, I understood the judge's reaction--slumping in his chair and rolling his eyes. Everyone, it seems, was suspect--the CIA, the FBI, the military, war profiteeers, the Mafia, anti-Castro activists, the media, possibly even LBJ.<br/><br/>Some conspiracy. Where did all these people hold their meetings? Why wasn't I invited? Seems like everyone else in America was.<br/><br/>But the assassination of JFK is nothing to joke about. At the time, one of the most painful facts about the event for many of us was that our president, and a fine man he was, could be taken down by a lone-wolf creep like Oswald. It would have been such a relief if we could have believed in some vast conspiracy instead. At least the killing would have made some sense."

But he was asked not to do that. <br/><br/>Whether this is true or not, the conversation between Doanld Sutherland and Kevin Cosner 2 hours into the movie touches on this subject.<br/><br/>It's a fact that over 70% of the American public believes that there was a conspiracy behind Kennedy's assassination, and this movie addresses the doubt that many of us has in very good detail. Even my friend who used to be in the military said that Kennedy's reaction in his limousine was that of someone clearly shot from the front - not from the back. With so many witness and evidence contradicting the official findings, no wonder so much doubt still lingers after all these years.<br/><br/>This is one of the most intriguing movie in American cinema, about one of the most intriguing story in American history.

","This is a great film of historical significance. Stone and Garrison are to be commended for their courage in pursuing and presenting a plausible alternative explanation for what occurred in Dallas nearly 50 years ago. Both were attacked savagely. Their motives, characters,mental state,objectivity and patriotism were repeatedly questioned. They were both dismissed,scorned, and derided by a tag-team parade of critics,journalists,politicians and bureaucrats.<br/><br/>Many point at Clay Shaw having been found not guilty by the jury in less than a half hour as proof the Garrison never had a case against Shaw and that Garrison was just grandstanding. Before the trial, Garrison presented his case to a three judge panel that had to decide if they thought there was sufficient evidence to warrant bringing the case to trial. The 3 judge panel felt that there was sufficient evidence. Then Garrison presented his case to a Grand Jury and the jury felt there was sufficient evidence to proceed to trial. Had either felt there was not enough evidence to proceed, Garrison's case would have stopped right there.<br/><br/>Garrison's case was severely hindered by the fact that corpses tend to be somewhat limited in their ability to respond to a subpoena, much less to be able to actually testify. Garrison's witnesses who were still breathing were mostly Blacks (who were not exactly highly regarded in the deep South during the 1960's)and homosexuals.<br/><br/>I think this film presents a scenario that is as close to the truth as we're ever likely to see. One life is cheap compared to the billions of dollars made by defense contractors over the course of the war in Vietnam."

","I think that our personal history can only make sense when we blend it with the global history. And as I said with another historic movie, facts are the bricks for getting into the events. Conclusions, hypothesis, commentaries are maybe useful but they can't replace the facts. This method is rewarding concerning this dramatic event of our previous century because it shocked a world while just a handful was present on this famous Dealey Plaza, November 1963. Above all, a movie make you see things as they were, thus you just call for your best judgment. So, let's take a look at what happened:<br/><br/>1) The supposed lone gunman (HLO) fired at the most difficult time to aim: when the presidential car moved away and not while it was right in front of him. Strange? 2) The place of the shooting is the best for a trap: you see the famous grassy knoll and just behind a huge parking and nothing else except railroads. Coincidence? 3) The definitive visual proof: the Zapruder movie: if JFK fell left and behind with the head gunshot, thus that means that someone behind him and at his right, as HLO, could have been the killer. Nonsense!<br/><br/>That's why I just loved this movie because it's like living this dreadful day right from where it happened. So when you heard a past (awful) president, involved in the Agency and making dollars with blood, saying ""it's a crap"", well, you know that the movie kicked where it hurts!<br/><br/>While watching it, I read the 1968 book ""The Plot"" which amazed me because I think it's the quickest book to reach the same conspiracy conclusion. Together, they make me understand the motive for the killing: JFK was a pacifist and as he would have been surely reelected for a second and finale mandate, he would have then his hands free to do what he wanted. And peace wasn't what the military-industrial complex wanted, as warned by his predecessor Eisenhower, himself coming from this corporation.<br/><br/>So, this movie is a powerful testimony for truth and in addition, a truly artistic masterpiece: the editing, the cinematography with fictional shooting and real footage makes a nearly virtual experience. It's not only talks because for each opinion, you see immediately the actual and real proof. We must thank Stone for his great cast and his attention to profile it as the real people. I have never been a great fan of Costner but for a actor labeled ""action"", he was just amazing portraying the attorney. He delivers a great incarnation of courage and dedication. If you add a great score from one of the best, John Williams, you got the ultimate movie of 1991: a story that you can't forget told by excellent artists! <br/><br/>In spite of its high quality, the winner for ""Best Movie"" at the academy awards was ""Silence of the lambs"".

Needless to say, the acting is in good hands, though Jones was the only one recognized with an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Stone's direction is fluid and the film's masterful editing deservedly took home an Oscar (as did the cinematography). The John Williams score was Oscar-nominated and, while it's no match for his best work, it is indispensable in setting the film's tone.<br/><br/>Lastly, I should point out that it was the director's cut that I saw and from what I know of the additions made it seems that the original cut may be even tighter on the whole.

Why not? Ever read Machiavelli? They are no ethics in politics. We hold as fact that Julius Caesar (along with a whole bunch of roman emperors) died as a result of political intrigue. Catherine the Great murdered her own husband to get power. Her grandson Alexander the first murdered his own father and Peter the Great killed his own son. Archeologists now think king Tut and Raamses III might have been murdered by members of their court. Not even the popes and Tibetan monks were above that sort of thing! Why couldn't it happen in 1960's United States? Democracy? I'm sorry to say this, but the only difference between democracy and dictature in that matter is how many people you have to fool in order to gain power. The difference is that this time, we're the ones being fooled, pretty hard to consider! We tend to have blind faith in our government (whatever country is the one we call ours). If they don't protect us (especially in war time or in a tensed international situation), who will? Stone's great merit was to make us doubt. Remind us to never leave our brains at the door. At the end of his monologue, Costner seems to break the fourth wall and speak to us as he says: ""It's up to you"".<br/><br/>In the end, I say everyone has the right to disagree with me, Stone or with any other ""fried conspiracy theorists"" (that, by the way, are also citizens, even the ones believing in UFO stuff) but those who compare this movie to ""Birth of a Nation"" (a movie that pratically resurrected the KKK) or to Riefenstal's work show extremely bad taste, underestimate the negative impact those movies had and are insulting more their own intelligence than Stone's work."

For example, in the demo of how JFK and Connally are shot with one bullet they are sitting at the same height and directly in line with one another when in fact Connally sat to JFK's left and was in a seat lower than JFK's. In the same demo the bullet is said to have changed direction and traveled upward after hitting JFK. This is based on where the bullet appears to have hit JFK's coat. His coat road up on him making it look like the bullet hit lower in his back than it did. The single bullet theory is plausible but did the bullet found on the stretcher do it? I think not.<br/><br/>One thing the movie did not explore that I have always wondered about -- if someone did plant the bullet on the stretcher how, at that time, did anyone know that it would be important to have to do so to ""create the single bullet theory""? No one could possibly have known at that time that it would be that critical.<br/><br/>Who killed Kennedy? Had to be the mob.

The main editors on the film are Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia. Of course Hutshing worked with Stone before, notably on ""Born on the Forth of July"" - another editor's movie. Scalia was a new choice for Stone and chosen no doubt for his technical aptitude for editing and being new Stone could easily be Scalia's puppet-master and pull the strings.<br/><br/>The film in some ways is a throwback to the great epic films that use to come from the studios in the golden age of Hollywood. Stating the obvious, it is based on true-life events of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and the death of President Kennedy and the only trial resulting from the crime. Some might argue that it's documentary-like presentation is at times too much information and slows down the film. For film aficionados this may be the reason the film is such a draw for them. Certainly a better film than it's rival for the Oscar nod and winner in 1991 ""The Silence of the Lambs.""<br/><br/>With an all-star cast, from beginning to end the film never stalls and speeds along like a roller-coaster ride. If there is an argument to be made for where the film might slow it would be the trial scenes. Don't mention the trial excerpts to any JFK conspiracy for they will tell you that the trial scenes are not transcript favorable. There is a lot of artistic license taken and watching this portion of the movie over and over you may be numbed into believing a test after the film may be forthcoming. <br/><br/>Decidedly this is an excellent film with fantastic acting, the direction is expertly applied and the editing is the star of the film.

"Blade_Le_Flambeur","Null","0","10","19 May 2004"," A stunning piece of cinema
","Oliver Stone's 'JFK' is quite simply put, a spectacular film. It is a film about one of the most enigmatic mysteries in American history, and is about courage, honor, and the American government. 'JFK' is a superbly well made picture, with powerful direction, top notch acting, and great visuals. On the fateful day of November 22, 1963 president John F. Kennedy is shot in his motorcade and dies of the wounds half an hour later. One of the many viewers of the news is Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), a D.A. for New Orleans. Upon hearing it, he is saddened.. he is a patriot and was an admirer of Kennedy. At first, he starts out by checking an anonymous tip, a strange man named David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) who is later discovered to have a much bigger role in the assassination then appears. After disbelieving Ferrie's alibi of what he was doing in Dallas on the day, he sends him to the FBI who release him without finding anything suspicious. But it is not until three years later when Garrison gets much deeper into the case, noticing some odd and embarrassing things about the Warren Report on the trial involving the case. He takes one of his employees, the trustworthy Lou Ivon, with him on a tour, pointing out odds and ends about Kennedy being shot from the book suppository by the obscure Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman). This starts off Garrison's initial doubts which increase as he investigates more and more into the case. Along with him for the investigation is the short tempered and tough Bill Broussard (Michael Rooker), the informative Suize Cox (Laurie Metcalf) and the hard working Al Oser (Gary Grubbs) and Numa Bertel (Wayne Knight). During his investigation, Garrison meets several strange characters.. a wild homosexual prostitute Willie O' Keefe (Kevin Bacon), the cunning Clay Shaw/ Bertrand (Tommy Lee Jones), a paranoid man named Jack Martin (Jack Lemmon), and a stranger, ""X"" (Donald Sutherland), who gives Garrison just the right motivation and strength to carry on Also watch out for smaller roles from people such as Ed Asner, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Walter Matthau. Also adding to Garrison's troubles is his skeptical wife, Liz (Sissy Spacek), who just wants him to take care of his family rather than lose himself in a case that happened three years ago. The chemistry between the actors is kinetic and downright superb, Costner's interactions with characters like Ferrie and O' Keefe work out exceptionally, and there are plenty of quotable moments of dialogue to go along with these scenes. Oliver Stone has always been a great director of actors, and this film is no exception. Each actor sinks into their role, especially Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald, he looks incredibly like the man. Joe Pesci is scene stealing as the jumpy and constantly paranoid David Ferrie, and gives a great energetic performance, most notably during a scene between him, Garrison, Ivon, and Broussard in which he gives a sharp and twisted monologue. The performances are also emotional as well, watch Garrison as he gives his case to the jury at the end of the film, his voice gets more and more emotional. These characters aren't just built from the actors though, and the screenplay by Oliver Stone and Zachary Sklar deserves heavy mention. Stone isn't just a director, he has numerous screenplay credits to himself as well ('Scarface', 'Evita'), and writing is something he's definitely talented at. Him and Sklar not only provide intense scenes filled with suspense and emotion, but also just gripping dialogue. Whether it be Garrison giving his thoughts on the depth of the case, or X giving valuable support to the investigator, the lines are just right, and the film also manages to be quite quotable. But these two stand out elements aren't the only good things to say about 'JFK'. The film is fantastic to look at. The cinematography by frequent Stone collaborator Robert Richardson ('Casino', 'Kill Bill') is dazzling (not to mention Oscar winning), the intense brightness he constantly uses works out great, as does the periodic flashbacks to black and white. Also very much worthy of mention is the (Oscar winning) editing by Joe Hutshing ('Born on the Fourth of July', 'Broken Arrow') and Pietro Scalia ('Good Will Hunting', 'Black Hawk Down'). The flashbacks are timed perfectly, and each piece fits just right, whether it be showing what Oswald was allegedly doing as Garrison narrates his case or the interactions of Clay Shaw and David Ferrie. The pacing is spot on, while the film has a high running time, it never gets drudging and never loses its energy. One of the best movie composers around, John Williams, gives an emotional and haunting score to the film, and it only adds more power to the scenes. And, it is impossible not to mention the unforgettable direction of Oliver Stone. He's quite possibly the greatest living director, and this film is proof enough. The story of 'JFK' could be told like a History channel documentary, but it is not. Instead, these historical events are made gripping and interesting, all by Stone's eye. He's been called heavy handed before, but without his hard edged punch, the film wouldn't be half as interesting. He directs with intellect yet a genuine passion, balancing out what's needed just right. I take no trouble in saying that 'JFK' is definitely one of the best three directed films ever. But is this tale of Jim Garrison merely entertaining? Most definitely not. It is an eye opener first and foremost, and rouses emotions from the viewer. It is a gripping morality tale.. one of courage and honor, and one of a man who would never give up no matter what the odds, and in the end his struggle proved well worth it. One should not take everything in 'JFK' for granted. While the film definitely uses quite a bit of facts, it still is only one view of the events. Some have said Oliver Stone is trying to shove his opinion down our throats. This isn't true, Stone is throwing out a question, a question that shouldn't have been forgotten, and he is giving his answers. But don't take just his. As Jim Garrison turns and  says as he speaks to the camera in one of the most memorable scenes in film history ... Its up to you."

This film is creepy in a way that makes the Blair Witch Project look like kid's stuff. This is by no means a horror movie but the lengths at which the government will go through to keep the JFK assasination under wraps is as blatantly obvious as it is startling.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's hatred for vietnam shows again in this film (the most noticable portrayals are Platton and Born On The Forth Of July) as it plays a fundimental part in the assasination.<br/><br/>There are so many memorable scenes in this film. The most gripping ones being the conversation with Donald Sutherland and the final hour long sumery that Costner gives the the jury. Every performance is top notch and it adds to my feeling of Joe Pesi being one of the greatest actors of our time.<br/><br/>If you can get your head around the communist/mob driven/government conspirisy plot then you will find an absolutely amazing and gripping film.

"schweinway","Null","0","10","5 March 2003"," Proficient, but not really persuasive
","Oliver Stone's `JFK' is a frustrating little movie. Kevin Costner turns in one of his better performances, which nearly breaks the mold of his limited capabilities as an actor, as Jim Garrison, the D.A. who tried to prove in court that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone shooting JFK on November 22, 1963. Other, better actors turn up in and out of the three-hour movie; Gary Oldman is cutely sinister as Oswald viewed in black and white flashbacks, Joe Pesci is an agitated leader of one of the botched Cuban refugee training programs (prior to the Bay of Pigs) who may or may not have known who killed the president, and Tommy Lee Jones is the Southern businessman Clay Shaw who Costner accuses of having secretly worked for the CIA in the time of the assassination. Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, Vincent D'Onofrio, Kevin Bacon and Walter Matthau all turn up in quaint cameos as well, but the only real constants in the movie's progression (meaning, flashbacks notwithstanding) are Costner and Sissy Spacek as his wife.<br/><br/>The picture is spectacularly shot and edited, and won deserved Oscars in both categories. All the actors do a fine job, particularly Pesci and Costner, who like I said, almost gets past his creative rut of playing frowning, na√É¬Øve boy scouts (see Field of Dreams, The Untouchables, etc). Stone offers a menu, if you will, of conspiracy theories behind the assassination - to generalize, you can pick from the Cubans, LBJ or the Mafia. While these little vignettes are sensationally delivered, none of them really propel the story forward, but rather provide interesting interludes in the main plot, which is fairly thin: Garrison wants to prove that Oswald either didn't do it at all, or didn't act alone, and ends up bringing Tommy Lee Jones to court because of it. His obsession with the president's death provides a little rocky domestic territory, as his marriage and home life get pushed out of the way, but this too is presented as being unimportant in the big picture.<br/><br/>What is the big picture? Aside from some potentially convincing ballistics information, such as a technical breakdown of Arlen Specter's `magic bullet' theory, Stone didn't really convince me that the JFK assassination was an intricately developed plot to serve an ulterior political motive - maybe that there was a second shooter, at best. His offering of theories, insights as to why the Cubans might have done it, etc, in exchange for evidence supporting the arrest of Oswald didn't sway me rationally like he may or may not have hoped it would. One does not get the opportunity to rethink history, but rather to look at it and try to tie it together as possible with what limited information they have. I guess my point is that some of the proposals in this movie are a little too far-fetched for their own good. As a movie? Well, it makes for an almost exciting, definitely watchable investigation, moving at a grueling dramatic pace that holds the viewer's attention very neatly - until the bizarrely flat final act of the movie. Costner's Garrison makes a staggering speech in the courtroom to prove not so much that Clay Shaw was involved in the assassination, but simply that there's more to the killing than meets the eye. This is a dramatically potent scene, I guess, but it's uneven in comparison to the rest of the movie and makes it more of a tidy presentation and less of a film; as if the two were mutually exclusive. `JFK' is most worth watching due to its clean and engaging management of information, its performances, and its technical proficiency, but not for its quality as an artistic or especially galvanizing motion picture."
"webmaster-49","Null","0","10","2 February 2003"," Ironic Masterpiece that exposes Conspiracy Theory
","While I doubt it was Stone's intention, his ""JFK"" does more to damage the credibility of the conspiracy theorists than any other work besides Posner's ""Case Closed."" In telling the story of Jim Garrison, the man who never met a theory he didn't believe, Stone convincingly tells the story of almost 30 years of wacky ""theories""--none of which have stood up to even the most cursory scrutiny. He, does, however, leave out one very important group of characters, namely, the small army of conspiracy nuts who attached themselves to Garrison's ""investigation"" with all the tenacity of a bunch of leeches going after a warm body.<br/><br/>The great irony is that Stone himself genuinely seemed to believe in a conspiracy and set out to create a counter-myth to stand against the much-maligned but never seriously refuted conclusions of the Warren Commission. And given that Stone is an incredibly gifted film-maker (or was anyway), his version is quite a bit more entertaining than that dry 26 vol. report. But, as the movie progresses, the counter-myth becomes ever more maniacal--it was the homosexual underworld, no, wait, the Cuban exiles, no, it was the Mob, no, it was the Mob and the CIA, no wait, it was the CIA and Lyndon Johnson, no, it was the entire structure of government and industry working with all the above!<br/><br/>There's no great mystery, really. The evidence (the real concrete evidence, not all the alleged forgeries and coverups and faked autopsies) has, and always did point at one person and one person only: Lee Harvey Oswald. And Stone, to his credit, gives time to this; and Gary Oldman, to his huge credit, creates a very convincing LHO. It's not too much of a stretch to imagine his character killing JFK. The creepy underworld of the conspiracy theorists is well depicted: the depraved homosexuals, the sinister ""black ops"" people, the lunatic fringe that Garrison dredged to produce his ""case"" against Shaw. Everyone and everything is over the top, as it should be.<br/><br/>
The JFK Assassination has always been about sensationalism and hysteria and Stone captures this world perfectly. He also does an incredible job of re-creating the swirling sense of paranoia of the early 60s and the aura of government betrayal at a time when the Kennedys were assassinated (and MLK), the CIA seemed to be running amok, and the Vietnam War spinning out of control. The movie is an artistic triumph. It's also a fast primer into the world of conspiracy theory where every piece of evidence against Oswald is ""fabricated"" and every conjecture about a conspiracy the ""truth."" Garrison the lonely crusader for truth is accurately (and ironically) depicted as a guy who got caught up in the JFK obsession to the point where he believed anything and everything anybody told him. If Stone had any sense of irony of his own, he would have showed us how Garrison's massive ego and vendetta against Clay Shaw made him the perfect tool for conspiracy buffs who desperately needed an elected official (another irony) to demonstrate that other elected officials orchestrated the murder of JFK.<br/><br/>JFK: the Movie does more to make JFK: the Conspiracy look laughable than all of the conspiracy literature put together. It's an incredible movie about how a search for the truth becomes more twisted and bizarre than the ""truth"" it's supposedly pursuing. A great movie, if not for quite the same reasons as many posters here would have you believe."

Being a native Texan, and having seen that warehouse where Oswald allegedly shot Kennedy, straight through the back, and in the head, I am not convinced that he could've done so in the amount of time, they said he did. However, I do believe that someone was hiding behind the fence on the grassy knowel on the other side of the same warehouse, and killed the president. Since there were all sorts of reports by bystanders who were told to shut up about by police shortly after. <br/><br/>As far as the conspiracy theory I'm convinced of, if any, is the one where the film suggests in a conversation between Costner and Sutherland about Jackie Kennedy having Jack killed for banging Marilyn Monroe, and then having her offed. Of course, I can't prove a thing, but remember this, she's the one who'd everybody least suspect. In these scenarios, it is most typically the one people would least suspect, and I can say that most wouldn't be surprised if it turned out that Johnson had him killed over the allegation that he was going to have America disarmed during his office, or some lunatic like Oswald acting on his own, or that the mob was mad about something, and the mob theory sounds far-fetched, because even though they are the mob, they wouldn't have enough power to assisanate the world's powerful and important man - the US president."

","Oliver Stone's JFK is a good movie, but it relies on too much historical revision to get it's point across.  It's good that viewers have had their minds opened and may now believe JFK was killed by our own government, but at the same time Oliver Stone's rather fanatical opinions about government issues in the 60's and 70's cloud this film.  For all of you who have not actually read any detailed research about the assassination, I would recommend it.  The film JFK takes many elements which are only speculation and makes them into hardline fact.  Now, I don't think the film is bad...80% of it is pretty much all based around the circumstances that comprise most of the conspiracy theory, but the remaining 20% is a little iffy.  The best example I can think of is Donald Sutherland's character of Mr. X.  In the film, Mr. X is essentially the turning point for Garrison. His story convices Garrison that the assassination is well beyond the scope he initially assumed.  However, in reality, Mr. X didn't really exist. The story he tells in the film was actually lots of information from several different sources and people.  Making the character of Mr. X might have saved screentime, but it deteriorates credibility.  Audiences were probably pretty impressed that a high-ranking military official would confess these things to Garrision...well, he didn't.  While some claim that Mr. X was indeed a real person, the information is sketchy.  my point is, Stone makes a lot of the case look for more believable than it really is.  Regardless, the movie certainly makes people think, and maybe that's why so many right-wingers love attacking its fans as ""Communists"" or historcial revisionists.  Anyone who earnestly thinks the ENTIRE case for conspiracy is simply paranoia and coicidence must be virtually brain dead, as much as I hate to say it.

","This movie is one of the best examples of what I like to call ""the fine five"" aspects of what makes a movie great. The first one is the director. I guess you can't get any better than Oliver Stone for this kind of subjects. Then there is the story, the plot, the script, basically the backbone of the whole thing, which is based mainly on the book ""On The Trail of The Assassins"" by Jim Garrison, the very same man who actually accused at least someone for the conspiracy on the assassination of JFK. I mean, talk about first-hand info! Number three is the acting.

He always does, which is why most of his storylines get a little tedious. True to form, he rarely passes up a chance to take a shot at his enemies, real or imagined, whenever he can. <br/><br/>But the thing I found most interesting about this 1991 film was how our hero, Mr Garrison, was forced to deal with every obstruction the White House and other gov't agencies could throw at him. He was slandered by the establishment press, was harrassed by the IRS, and was forced to deal with a coordinated campaign, engineered by the Administration and the Justice Dept, to hinder his investigation and discredit him at every turn.<br/><br/>
Given the recent misadventures of a different prosecuting attorney and another administration, one can't help but notice the parallels. As Mr Garrison would  say (very loosely paraphrased), ""We are now on the other side of the looking glass. From now on, black is white, and right is wrong.""<br/><br/>
I, for one, would be curious to know how much screen time Mr. Stone would invest on this aspect of the story if he were making the film today. It really does depends on what side of the glass you are on."

The characters are rich (even if they are just characters), and the logic is laid out in a way that Sherlock Holmes couldn't have improved upon. True, Kevin Costner doesn't show the most emotion (or even talent) in this film, but that's appropriate, because we are supposed to concentrate on all the other wackos that make up for Costner's blandness.  Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, and the entire supporting cast are terrific. While it is true that Oliver Stone may not have it exactly right, he proves pretty convincingly that there was some kind of conspiracy.  And the underlying message is one of revolution; if our governmental leaders are corrupt, he says, then we -- America -- have to take the power out of their hands.

As I sat in the theater, I said to myself that this was the greatest piece of propaganda I had ever seen.  I meant it as a compliment, for cinema is replete with messages that aim to shift attitudes and manufacture beliefs.  Most do not do the job as well as Stone's film.<br/><br/>That said, I have rethought my position.  If Stone included so many overlapping and competing theories [and assassins!] in one film, mustn't he have known that each new possibility would dilute the probability that previous suspects were responsible? Think of Oliver Stone in front of that federal jury: just as each new conspirator that Garrison named created a reasonable doubt about Clay Shaw's role in the matter, so too every new ""force"" that Stone identified made it less and less probable that the list of suspects could conspire successfully.  If Stone seems to draw to Dealey Plaza every group of nuts extant in 1963, that makes it hard to understand how they managed not to shoot or at least expose one another.<br/><br/>So, suppose the movie is about how conspiratorial thinking defeats itself. Once a Jim Garrison is prepared to disbelieve official accounts--and, boy, does the Warren Commission invite disbelief!--then vistas of suspects are opened up.  If Lee Harvey Oswald is a patsy, his background suggests multiple agencies who could have used him.  If one follows the money [as in ""All the President's Men"" or Jerry McGuire], then a host of powerful dudes stood to benefit from JFK's demise.  [Granted, most of the well-heeled stood to profit no matter who was president!]<br/><br/>I appreciated the movie when first I saw it.  I enjoy it annually now.

Actually, any historian will tell you that if half of what someone says can be proved false that ought to tell you something about how one should regard the other half.  Because when it comes to the techniques that Stone uses, the factual record exposes him, not the Warren Commission as the real liar.<br/><br/>We start with Jim Garrison, who in real life was nothing like Kevin Costner and whose vicious vendetta against an innocent man, Clay Shaw makes even the rational believers of a conspiracy shun him to this day.  Viewers of ""JFK"" may also be interested to know that the real life ""Colonel X"" is a man named L. Fletcher Prouty, who in real life is associated with Lyndon LaRouche's kook organizations.  Then there is the fact that Stone deliberately ignores the existence of ten eyewitnesses who saw Oswald kill Police Officer Tippit, and how Stone also made up a star witness (Kevin Bacon) who never existed because Garrison's real-life star witness Perry Russo (who ironically has a cameo in the film) was exposed as a crackpot.  And the list is endless.<br/><br/>Finally, let's consider the laughable premise Stone puts forth. That a ""right wing conspiracy"" murdered a fiscally conservative centrist Democrat who was a dogged advocate of the Cold War just to make Lyndon Johnson, the man who gave us the Great Society and the Civil Rights Act president? Stone is so out of touch with the political situation as it existed in 1963 that it's frightening to think that people would use his film as an introductary primer for recent history.<br/><br/>About the only redeeming feature of this movie is John Williams' score (which I often have fun with by making up pro-Warren Commission lyrics to the title melody)"
"SodaGuy","Null","0","10","31 March 1999"," An important film about a historic event that opened my eyes
","When I saw JFK, I realized I wasn't seeing just another film based upon real events. JFK was an eye opening film that told another side to the assassination of our 35th president. It featured two of my favorite actors; Kevin Costner who played Jim Garrison and Tommy Lee Jones who portrayed Clay Shaw both played an important role in bringing facts to light that may or may not be true. Jim Garrison was responsible for bringing the only prosecution in the JFK assassination. Garrison didn't have it easy looking for answers to his questions; he had to battle a lot of governmental red tape, and he still didn't get his answers. There were other Hollywood heavyweights who had added their names to this film besides Costner and Jones: Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, the late John Candy, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, Walter Matthau, and Kevin Bacon. These actors might not have had major parts but they are tremendous talents and they all had important contributions to get this story out in the open so the American people could make their mind up as I did. In my opinion, this is one event that had to be brought to light in film so we could visually see what the real story had been on November 22, 1963; it also gave me information to base my decision on whether or not there was a cover-up or among the ranks of the government or not. With the flashbacks to that fateful day in November, I understood what the movie was about. Oliver Stone did a flawless job in recreating the events surrounding the JFK assassination. After watching JFK, I have reason to believe there was a conspiracy but I'm not sure because it seemed so one sided. This was definitely an eye opening history lesson that was told that everybody should see."

","Director Oliver Stone tackles the biggest conspiracy theory of all time in this all-star cast, big budget production. It is not that easy to defend a theory like this, but Stone packs in a great deal of believable evidence to back his claim. The idea that there was more than one individual involved in the assassination of President Kennedy doesn't seem that far off the mark after viewing Stone's three hour plus masterpiece. Kevin Costner brilliantly plays District Attorney Jim Garrison, the only man in history to bring someone to trial for the murder of President Kennedy. The rest of the cast is great, I especially loved Joe Pesci and John Candy - two very different roles than what they were used to. What you may not read on the trivia section for JFK is that Martin Sheen did the voiceover narration for the film, he played President Kennedy in the TV series ""Kennedy"" and in THE DEAD ZONE he plays a politician that faces an assassination attempt. JFK took two Academy Awards for best cinematography and best editing. These two awards were well deserved as Stone is now notorious for editing black & white sequences with color sequences which blend together beautifully. This film will always be a milestone, in my opinion, in risk-taking cinema. Whether you believe it or not, you have to give the man credit for going against the common ideology and making a bold statement that we don't have to believe everything we hear and we don't have to swallow everything whole, that it is good to question things no matter how tragic they are.

","God, I remember how highly I thought of this film when it came out. Being 19 years old at the time, I suppose my interests toward ""important"" issues were evolving into a more relavant, adult and analytical perspective. I wanted information. I wanted to know who was pulling the strings behind the secure illusions of my youth (those comforting magical walls that all seem to crumble in the turbulence and onset of higher education and young adulthood). But of course, as a teenager, I was certainly more influenced and impressed than I am now with the flash and fervor of those who truly create a lot of attention through their work -- entertainers. As unfortunate as it may seem, we cannot easily dismiss the stranglehold that all forms of media and pop culture have on our thinking and opinions in this country. Indeed, when ""JFK"" was released in 1991, it was preceded and followed by an onslaught of assassination conspiracy coverage in which a massive amount of unchallenged accusations and other preposterous information was given an air of seriousness by the public, myself included. ""JFK"" also should be given credit for sparking interest in the house passing legislation that released an unprecedented amount of previously classified files regarding the assassination. I would applaud the film for at least opening this dialogue. But the predominant public opinion that there was a conspiracy still persists. Much of this speculation is rooted in the same low standard of proof that this film depicts. It should therefore share some of the responsibility for the continued popularity of these views.<br/><br/>In Roger Ebert's new book (""The Great Movies"" I think), he still insists that the inaccuracy of this film (which is largely outdated and discredited at this point) doesn't matter. Film should not be held to the same standard of truth, as journalism is, but is instead about depicting feel and emotion, he claims. I agree with him in that the movie is a conglomeration of conspiracy theories and feel -- specifically the paranoia the country felt after the assassination, of which I shared at one time. We want to think that JFK died for something more important than a lone crackpot's disturbing and dillusional political fanaticism. We want to know that JFK died for a reason. The movie dramatizes this desperate mood surrounding the search quite well. I truly disagree with Ebert's assertion that films have absolutely no responsibility to get their facts straight. First of all, I think some events, such as this one, deserve a higher standard of accuracy in thier cinematic treatments. I would mind less, and I think most people would, if say a film like ""Ed Wood"" was further from the facts than ""JFK."" Secondly, Oliver Stone does not present this story as mere speculation, but as historic revision (regardless of what he may claim he intended, this is certainly how the film was presented and preceived. One merely has to review all of the college lectures Stone gave, and still gives, in an attempt to achieve credibility and excite outrage). From the opening documentary footage (which is sprinkled with recreation footage, by the way) and somber Martin Sheen voice over to the inclusion of mostly fact-based characters and the exhibition of the Zapruder film, Stone is certainly making a real accusation that falls short (wisely, in my opinion) of presenting us specific any conclusions. What should have Stone done then? I would never argue that this film shouldn't have been made, or worse yet, censored in some way. I just feel that this is a really lousy, innaccurate, and largely irresponsible jumble of fact and fiction that attempts to exonerate an assasin, exalt a dishonorable and harrassing politician (Garrison), further tarnish the reputation of an deceased innocent (Shaw) and avoid the logical and reasonable information that explains the Warren Commission inconsistencies and other seemingly ""mysterious"" evidence.  Acting wise, Costner, Pesci and Bacon all give hammy, way over-the-top performances and the story-telling is simply confusing, vague and disjointed. I could go on and on (haven't I done that already?) about the specific evidence that completely refutes what Stone has depicts, but this isn't exactly the forum. I strongly recommend that anyone interested in keeping an open mind toward reason and facts surrounding these nagging issues and debates (the pristine bullet, altered body, Oswald FBI/CIA connection, et.al.) read ""Case Closed"" by Barry Posner. The information is exhaustively and professionally researched with an academic approach of the highest standard and integrity. This is a very special and important book that does not ignore Oswald or Ruby's stories, for they are integral in understanding how this tragedy came to be. Nor does Posner ignore the arugments, put forth by completely rational people, that lead one to mistakenly conclude the existence of a conspiracy."

I suggest that anyone who finds Stone's ""Coup d'etat"" version of history implausible view both movies. 13 WEEKS does a brilliant job of establishing the motive we seen borne out in the JFK assassination. Stones's film is wrenching, graphic, and hardhitting. Some materials from the second JFK trial (E.Howard Hunt vs Liberty Lobby 1985) are used. The second case was more conclusive, but Stone couldn't buy the book rights to ""Plausible Denial"" so he used the Garrison book on the  1969 trial for his drama.
