","I haven't seen a romance this touching since I was the same type of single sad sack as depicted by the hero of (500) Days of Summer. <br/><br/>Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has his radar up for ""the girl of his dreams"" when he meets Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Too bad for Tom Summer is stuck on friends-with-benefits mode. Let the tension begin.<br/><br/>Director Marc Webb captures the feeling of innocent, naïve love expertly. Anyone who has taken the lyrics of the Smiths too closely to heart, would be moved by the idea of the person they are crushing on sing to them: ""To die by your side/is such a heavenly way to die."" No wonder Tom soon falls head over heels for this girl.<br/><br/>As events unfold out of sequence, you know all along Tom has fallen for a time bomb of a woman, and he can't even see the countdown. When that bomb finally blows up in his face, it unfolds with powerful simplicity-- no exposition or dialog, just two juxtaposed events that capture the heartache of reality hitting a person who sees a person through the filter of deep-seated emotions that were planted at too young an age.<br/><br/>So many romantic films nowadays concern themselves with cute ideas; take 'He's Just Not That Into You' or 'Serendipity' for example. Even movies like 'Knocked Up' where a pot-smoking, video-gaming, narcissistic slob tries to turn his life around to try to be a father feels more contrived than real. These movies forget about human feelings. <br/><br/>Who cares about stock or cartoonish characters in love. The couple in (500) Days of Summer have true chemistry. There are some beautiful, subtle moments of tenderness as well as some heart- rending moments of disconnectedness between the two that never comes across as heavy-handed. The movie constantly reminds you that these are two different people with different ideas of a relationship, yet they stubbornly continue dating, and they remain lovable all the same.<br/><br/>An omniscient narrator sets the film up early on by noting ""this is not a love story."" And, in a way, it isn't. It's a story about feelings. It just so happens (500) Days of Summer captures the sensation of falling in love better than most movies.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, visit indieethos.com"

","Let's face it. We've all done our share of ""dumping"". Whether it's the, ""Lets just be friends,"" or the all too familiar, ""It's not you, it's me,"" tactic, as long as you're not on the receiving end it becomes a question of, ""How quickly can I get this over with, so I can move on with my life?"" Equally, all of us (yes even Brad Pitt) have experienced what it feels like to ""be"" dumped and the complex emotions that unexpectedly follow. If you're one of the fortunate souls that have managed to escape the throws of relationship hell, you'll probably fare better with renting the newest addition to the Rambo series. For the rest of you who've at one time or another gotten your hearts ripped out of your chests and stomped into a million pieces only to turn you into unshaven, alcoholic hermits on the brink of starvationthis movie is dedicated to you. <br/><br/>Tom (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) is a wanna-be architect turned professional greeting card writer whose life is thrown for a loop when he suddenly falls for the ""new girl"" Summer (Zooey Deschanel, Almost Famous). As one who appeared most certainly unattainable at first glance, Tom manages to charm her into what she coins as a, ""casual relationship."" Eventually, Tom ends up questioning their status with one another, which manages to put strain on the relationship, causing her to request the dreaded ""time apart."" (500) Days of Summer chronicles the bitter sweet beginnings, the untimely endings and all of that confusing stuff that takes place during the in betweens of a relationship that just isn't meant to be.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is presented in an effective non-linear style that sets it apart from its romantic comedy predecessors, rotating back and forth between dates signified by a simple title card flashing in between scenes (2), (50), (150) and so on to represent the various days in the course of Toms roller coaster of a relationship. This seesaw method of bouncing to and fro successfully manages to force the viewer in a physically engaging shared experience of Tom's feelings, which is something every director aspires to elicit from their intended audience. <br/><br/>The real kudos go to Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber, whose script is practically flawless. You can't help but feel that their authenticity and attention to detail while constructing each scene through appropriately sarcastic and funny dialogue exchanges among all of the main characters involved, particularly those between Deschanel and Levitt which come across as heartbreakingly real and genuine. Their creative way of crafting the simple concept of a break up through unconventional story structuring is a refreshing concept that begs to be seen more in a world where most conventional films tend to play it safe. <br/><br/>Leads Deschanel and Levitt manage to bring something quite special to the screen in their portrayals of Tom and Summer (both ""last nameless""). Their chemistry is really what makes the film a joy to watch. Mostly thanks to Neustadter and Weber's superb dialog, both actors seem so comfortable in their roles that their interactions with one another transcend the screen and naturally unfold before our eyes as if we were voyeurs to their unraveling, wanting so much to change the fate of their outcome, but helpless to do so. Deschanel is sexy, carefree and bound to be adored by males everywhere as Summer. Levitt captures the struggle of the neurotic ""boy in love"" exceptionally through all of his various stages of emotional imbalance. <br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is a poem to every down and out guy who thinks he's the only one whose ever been dragged through the mill by their own Summer. What undoubtedly ends up making this picture so brilliant is how relatable it is to its victims and victimizers a like. When all is said and done, there is most definitely a lesson to be learned by Tom's experiences. Everyone you meet along the way, whether just passing through or sticking around for awhile, has a purpose. In the end nothing lasts forever, relationships begin, relationships end. Try to be thankful for all the people that broke your heart, they more than likely helped you find yourself in the process especially you, Summerbitch."

","It does not pretend that women are lofty and romantic and it shows women as back stabbing, untruthful, unyielding and mercurial.
This scenario has played out in real life for years. This film is unflinching as showing a man as romantic and a woman as unreliable."
"Billy_Costigan","Null","255","360","22 August 2009"," The Beautiful Days of Summer
","Everyone loves summer. It's a time for friends, family, and fun. Ballgames, barbecues, amusement parks, and movies, summer is just a time to sit back, relax and enjoy. Enjoy time off, good weather and whatever else it might bring. Am I missing something? Oh yes, love. Summer is a time for love.<br/><br/>The film can be pretty much summed up in one of the first lines of the film. ""This is a story of boy meets girl. But you should know up front, this is not a love story."" But is it? 500 Days of Summer is not your typical romantic film. There's something to it, something more than your usual romantic comedy. Maybe it's the style it's done? Maybe it's the realistic nature? Maybe it's the wonderful music? Maybe its the beautiful cinematography? Maybe, its Tom and Summer...<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are the leads, Tom and Summer. These are real everyday people. Tom, a believer in true love. Summer, a doubter. Which reminds me of one particular scene where Summer questions Tom about believing in love. Tom replies, ""It's love, it's not Santa Claus."" It is a real thing, a crazy little thing called love. Tom falls in love with Summer from the start. She doesn't. Tom is like every other guy, and every guy knows of a girl like Summer. The girl they want, but can't have. They try, to no avail. It's frustrating, and Tom is frustrated. He's happy then sad. He doesn't know what to think. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry together and give solid performances. You really believe their relationship and hardships. It makes you notice the little things in relationships. The film highlights two young stars on the rise. With some great performances lately for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, his stock is rising... dare I say an up and coming Heath Ledger? <br/><br/>The story is not in direct order as it goes back and forth from different days Tom remembers his life and relationship with Summer. When remembering, we may not remember every detail in order. We choose what we want to remember. May that be the good, or the bad. For Tom, it's a little bit of both. Big props to the editing department. The film shows the good and the bad of love, relationships, and life. There's something about it that sets it apart from the usual romantic comedy.<br/><br/>500 Days of Summer is really refreshing now a days. It's funny, unique, and true to life. It's got something for everybody to like. Director Marc Webb shines in his feature film debut. I'm interested to see where he goes from here. 500 Days of Summer has quickly become a late summer highlight for me and surprisingly so at that."

And yet people praise this film?"
"sundevil27","9","343","499","30 January 2009"," Summer Lovin'
","They said this movie wasn't going to be a love story, but that's simply not true cause I feel all warm and fuzzy after watching this flick. I think it's Love. How could you not love this movie, this a story about a guy named Tom who wants to be an architect but ends up working a meaningless job at a greeting card company creating romantical propaganda on paper. Luckily for him the most perfect girl in the world, Summer, just started working at his office and wouldn't you know it, she loves The Smiths, too. It's a match made in Ikea Heaven, but wait there is a twist here! This goddess of all things shabby chic doesn't believe in love, furthermore she doesn't want to be held down by a relationship. Oh No! Poor Tom. Those ocean blue eyes, that voice, that smile, those eyes.... oh those eyes, how could Tom not fall deeply in love with Summer. So begins the season of love, the 500 Days of Summer. In 500 amazing days Tom will learn about relationships, reconciliations (a good Ex never dies), Love, Lose and most importantly about moving forward.<br/><br/>Now talk about great performances, this ones got two. You want Zooey, you got Zooey. She's all over this one, easily one of her top performances to date. She is simply truth in this movie, she'll make you love her and then she'll slowly break your heart but you'll just want to love her more until all you see are those glowing blue eyes in your loneliest nightmares. Joseph Gordon Levitt is so prime here, the chemistry between he and Zooey clicks perfectly and not only that but since every woman,man and child is in love with the knee bending powers of Ms. Deschanel it must be said that JGL gives such a strong performance that he clearly owns this movie all the way till the very end. You might come on down to the cinema looking for Zooey but you'll be rushing home to hit up the IMDb to see what the 3rd' Rock kids been up to over the last 8 ( hint... see 2005's Brick). While watching JGL's performance it's pleasantly reminiscent of a pre-Brokeback Heath. He has such a charm about him that glows and an easy smile that jumps off the screen, plus much like Heath he has the chops to take it dark and lonesome with sincerity if the flick requires. The rest of the cast rounds out nicely with a few supporting folks like Clark Gregg who plays Tom's square Boss and Geoffrey Arend who is good for a few good sidekick chuckles. By the way special shout out to Ian Reed Kesler who played the ""Douche"" (IMDBs words not mine) with perfection. That must have been an interesting audition call.. looking for 30-something dude to play the ""Douche"". Well Played Sir! <br/><br/>Now the dynamic duo aside, Marc Webb the Director has got a little something-something going on. Past sins aside (directing Jesse McCartney videos, WTF?), it seems that his music video hipness lends a freshness and style to the overall appearance of this flick. The movie very rarely missed its mark and by golly its got real DEPTH!. Needless to say this makes it quite a bit more interesting then the latest McConaughey (dude what happened, you were so cool in Dazed) and Kate Hudson needs a paycheck mindless studio romance. You'll have lots to talk about and feelings to relive long after this ones stopped rolling the credits. Additional strong points here are a visual aesthetic that has a modern meets Capraesque remix, which felt very much built around Zooey Deschanel's fabulous style. The colors and landscape are all complimentary to the movie, downtown LA never looked so nice! The other thing we got going on here is a killer soundtrack, built around some Smiths, Doves, and a few others, not mention the fact that once again we get a chance to hear Zooey Deschanel do a little karaoke in the movie which is a tasty little treat.<br/><br/>Bottom line 500 Days is going to be on your mind in 2009 and chances are that like a good EX it will always pop back in your life and you'll dust if off and pop it in the player and go down memory lane remembering all good stuff, then like a swift punch in the gut like only a good EX can, it'll break your heart all over again.<br/><br/>See it, believe it."
"ferguson-6","8","211","306","20 July 2009"," This is Not a Love Story
","Greetings again from the darkness. The narrator warns us upfront ... this is not a love story. Still, we are so preconditioned by Hollywood, that directive merely floated around in my head until near the end of the film when I realized it was perfectly accurate.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levit and Zooey Deschanel are the leads and each bring a certain quirkiness and sensitivity to their roles. Watching them grow as a couple just never quite clicks for the viewer the way it does for JGL's character. He buys in hook, line and sinker and believes his destiny for love is being fulfilled by Summer (Zooey).<br/><br/>Director Marc Webb throws a bit of everything at us - just to prove this is not a traditional love story. We get the fun of memory blender - flashbacks like Day 488, Day 2, Day 159 - well you get the point. That is how most of us remember anyway: non-linear. We also get a funny musical number in the park, a b & w Bergmanesque dramatization, and a leading man whose poetic musings are limited to his writing quips for a greeting card company. Oh, he also takes love advice from his 11 year old soccer-playing sister (Chloe Moretz), but wisely declines most of it from his best friend played by sexist, drunken (and funny) co-worker, Geoffrey Arend.<br/><br/>What I really like about the film is that it is different, yet very realistic. So often our ""dream"" girl is just not quite a fit in this world, yet she and the next guy are just right. Doesn't seem fair, but in reality, it is not only fair, but perfectly just. And remember, there is always another season ... maybe Autumn?"

","Who is Mark Webb? Anyone? Anyone? It is an astonishing piece of work for a first time feature film director. He counts with a beautifully crafted screenplay and two sensational leading performances and that's where the success of this comedy resides. Jodseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are two startling originals with a winning screen presence and a brain, yes, a brain. I was involved in their peculiar relationship because there isn't a hint of shallowness in their back and fourth. I believe it, completely, and when you sit in the dark and believe what you see on the screen, things are going to happen to you the way that happened to me. It is again a confirmation that treating your audience with respect will pay off somewhere along the line. I love Zooey Deschanel, she reminds me of some my favorites of the past without looking or sounding like anybody else. And Joseph Gordon Levitt, well, this young man is something else. He projects a humanity that doesn't need to be embellished. It's just there for us to dive into. Marvelous actor, marvelous performance, marvelous film. I'm so thrilled to be able to say that."
"PoeticProse22","10","158","236","19 August 2009"," ""500 Days of Summer"" is a delightfully engaging and poignant tale of love
","""This is a story of boy meets girl. The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met the one. This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total mis-reading of the movie 'The Graduate'. The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief. Since the disintegration of her parent's marriage she'd only love two things. The first was her long dark hair. The second was how easily she could cut it off and not feel a thing. Tom meets Summer on January 8th. He knows almost immediately she is who he has been searching for. This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story."" <br/><br/>500 Days of Summer is an intriguingly original take on falling in love. Every emotion involved with a relationship seems to be relayed; from the strange and quirky aspects of new love to the tragedy of heartbreak. Marc Webb deftly incorporates his ingenuity and comedy into the film. The writers quite skilfully enrich the film with one of the most immensely beautiful and original screenplays to come along in a while.<br/><br/>Tom, a greeting-card writer with artistic dreams beyond his mundane job, meets Summer and quickly falls for her. Eventually, he manages to charm her into a ""casual relationship"". So begins the 500 days that chronicle the happiness, heartbreak, and every other aspect involved with the often changing tides of romance.<br/><br/>500 Days of Summer portrays a relationship that is more realistic and less clichéd than most others in it's woefully unoriginal and formulaic genre. In doing so, the film never feels anything less than completely innovative and incredibly fun. The film's story is told in a refreshingly non-linear fashion that strives for and often reaches perfection with each and every scene.<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful, especially from the two leads. Since starring in Mysterious Skin (a disturbingly compelling film), Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been one of my favorite actors and proves yet again why he is one of the most talented actors of his generation. His performance was truly fantastic. Zooey Deschanel is absolutely wonderful in her portrayal of Summer and her quirky personalities. Their chemistry is wondrously compelling to watch and their moments together seem wholly convincing and genuine. The supporting cast is terrific throughout and very fun to watch. <br/><br/>The music was marvelous and really added to the film. Everyone involved does an amazing job to connect the several elements of love into a satisfying and moving conclusion. The film often shuffles between whimsy and realistic, but, rather than getting lost because of it, the story only seems to be enhanced due to the chaotically transitional moods.<br/><br/>500 Days of Summer is a hilarious, deftly thoughtful film about love. The performances are astonishing and the writing is sublime. It is a thoroughly clever and impressive film that shouldn't be missed."

","I disagree with all the 10/10 reviews as well as the 1/10 reviews.<br/><br/>For the 10/10 reviewers: this is not a romantic film. This is a film about the usual vulgar lying woman who does not know what she wants, except instinctively she reacts badly to a sincere man who loves her. He is honest and transparent and so the woman stabs him in the back. That is realism and anti-romantic.<br/><br/>For the 1/10 reviewers: it is good that hollywood depicts the truth that women want men who are bad for them and bad to them. Do them, enter them, give them the old in and out routine and they are yours. Be gentle, be good, be kind and enquire regarding their wishes and guess what? She will cheat on you and dump you.<br/><br/>

"santoshayoga","4","121","179","29 August 2009"," A different opinion
","I was really hoping and expecting to like this film. I was surprised to walk out of the theater annoyed at what seemed like an adolescent take on romantic love. Maybe part of the problem is that I recently watched Annie Hall. Like many other filmic treatments of love, 500 days seems derived from Annie Hall. There are Bergman references, cartoon characters, split screens, direct address of the audience which all smell and feel like the classic. Even the Deschanel character seems like a flat, more one dimensional,cynical version of Annie (she doesn't hold a candle to Diane Keaton, no where near the charm and far more disturbed) delivering conversation ending platitudes like ""what always happens...life."" (oooh, that's deep). Sis far more a caricature than anything else. I would lay bets her marriage ends in divorce and that she is much more pathological than the film lets you in on. The Joseph-Gordon Levitt character also seems unsophisticated and puerile. Although he is charming in his role, he is never in anything approaching love with this woman; he remains mired in his projections and idealizations of her and we are forced to watch this painful display of 14 year old obsession. I think by the end he gets it, but by then you have had to suffer right along with him. He is also not spared the stultifying writing {the quitting his job speech where he decides he's not going to be part of the ""bulls**t"" any longer) that makes this move sound like a grown ups Say Anything.<br/><br/>I guess that was my main problem with the movie. It just doesn't really seem to have anything intelligent or important to say about love. These people didn't seem credible to me, they lacked depth and maturity. In the 32 years that have elapsed since Annie Hall it seems that our culture has gotten more childish and superficial and less, not more, understanding of love. Maybe that is what is most disappointing to me; that this is what we have to say about the subject. If that is the case no wonder people are so emotionally stunted when it comes to relationships. <br/><br/>And lastly, I just couldn't buy the whole LA thing. Why try so hard to make LA look like New York? Who takes the train, the subway and the bus? I mean, isn't LA good enough as it is without tying to make it look urban in the traditional sense?"

","This was an excellent romantic comedy, although many might not agree that it is either romantic or a comedy. I found myself laughing out loud at many of the scenes, but the laughs in the theater were few, and I think most people would label this a drama with streaks of black comedy.<br/><br/>The driving force behind what makes this movie work (beside the script) is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen, who carries the movie on the basis of his physical comedy and acting ability. He is the unrequited love interest in the film. JGL does have brief glimpses of true love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel) but it's clear she's not interested in anything permanent, just a good time. After his initial sexual encounter with Summer, JGL engaged in a choreographed dance routine of Hall & Oats ""Your Making my Dreams Come True"", which should win JGL some type of award.<br/><br/>Deschanel plays the role she usually plays, soulful & pretty free spirit. She played the character very well and the movie viewer could well understand her reticence to engage in a long term affair with Tom.<br/><br/>These types of movies might leave some cold, but the ending turned out well.<br/><br/>One additional bonus was Chloe Moritz, who played Tom's younger teenage sister and Psycho-Analyst. She was great.<br/><br/>A very good movie worth checking out. A near perfect date movie I might add."
"wakemeup36","5","49","74","19 April 2010"," My very confused outlook
","I've avoided writing a review for this film for quite some time now because of a few reasons. One of them being I've been very unsure of how exactly I feel about this movie.<br/><br/>Critics and average movie goers have praised this movie immensely. It has been described by professional critics as ""a delightful comedy, alive with invention"" among other (positive) things. This specific statement is right about the movie being innovative. We have all seen, heard and read the overdone 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gains girl again'. But this is more like 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl... for good'. Going back to the statement :'a delightful comedy'? I think not. There is almost nothing funny about this movie. The supposed 'funny' parts are basically swearing...ummm...yep that's it. The other parts were way too depressing or 'touchy' to be perceived as humorous. Why this is branded as a romantic comedy I will never understand. If it were up to me I would brand this as an anti-romance movie more than anything. I will not go into the plot too much but I can tell you that the movie makes me sick even thinking about the concept of romance and love. How Summer (the girl) is perceived by Tom (the boy) as her soul mate and how it definitely seems that way in the beginning of their relationship. How it feels like they're 'in love'. And how Tom is pretty much stabbed and mentally abused when Summer suddenly described she's not interested. The popular 'Expectations/Reality' scene in which, on one side of the screen, Tom gains summer back (the expectations) and on the other side of the screen, where he is completely ignored by her (the reality). And of course the ending, which I won't spoil, all of these aforementioned factors combined together make me sick to my inner core.<br/><br/>I will commend the movie for being original, not following a generic romance movie formula. And this is probably more realistic than just about all movies in the same vein. But... I just can't like it. It just disgusts and frustrates me way too much. Underneath all the sunny sunshine presentation of the movie, there is too much darkness and depression. And I'm not saying that this is a necessarily a bad thing. It's just that, the way it's portrayed doesn't click with me. It felt me leaving very hollow and unhappy.<br/><br/>Then again, I am rating this more than I would rate a typical romance/drama and I'm not a fan of this genre so considering that this is a good rating. If you're into the romance genre check it out. Perhaps it's just my interpretation that's making me feel so disgusted at the movie. Like I said in my title, my views on this are pretty confused."

","You've got Zooey Deschanel acting like the new Meg Ryan, and a looking-and-sounding-more-like-Ledger-everyday Jason Gordon-Levitt; both are decent thespians, neither have unflattering angles, reviews use the word 'quirky' more times than you can count--this is pure box office gold right here. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>Nothing. Or so I thought. I actually wanted to see this movie. And, despite the annoyingly sporadic bursts of applause from an overenthusiastic moviegoer, I actually didn't find it too bad. But then I watched it again. I missed the first 5 minutes, see. The longer I thought about this movie, the more I found it disturbing.<br/><br/>""Any resemblance to people living or dead is purely accidental...Especially Jenny Beckman...Bitch.""<br/><br/>This movie is really about hate, revenge, and why you shouldn't date fun, interesting, and unique women.<br/><br/>For a movie that mentions the word 'love' more times than any movie I've seen before, it has hardly anything to substantial or significant to say about this elusive idea. Oohhhhh, so it takes TWO people to fall in love! Really?! Is that news? One will learn more about a) indie music (the Smiths are indie now, I guess), b) how to make music videos from Marc Webb, and c) how to go on fun dates by frolicking in furniture stores, record shops, and drawing on your date's arm while staring meaningfully into the distant architecture.<br/><br/>Tom Hansen does absolutely nothing to enrich Summer as a person; or help her confront her childhood issues. He is simply the proverbial dick in the glass case. Break glass in case of emergency. Zooey's character Summer on the other hand, inspires Tom to pursue his life's ambition to become an architect. And he even ends up with the drop-dead Minka Kelly (who receives unusually high credits for gorgeously appearing for less than 5 minutes) as a result. So despite his bitching, Tom actually came out of it better than, perhaps, Summer. The audience doesn't even see who Summer ends up marrying...the writers know they can't justify it, besides, they've built Tom up too much already. So they just leave it at some lame encounter in a café where some random schmo comments on an Oscar Wilde book she's reading. Can this movie possibly get any more indie?<br/><br/>If you haven't seen ""When Harry Met Sally,"" I highly recommend watching that instead. At least you'll learn something about relationships."

","I don't regularly comment on movies, but this has a personal accord with me.<br/><br/>My girlfriend of one year broke up with me the day before I went to watch this film, as promised.<br/><br/>That being said, Tom (Joseph Gordon Levit) embodies my apathy and frustration in every mannerism. He allows the audience to feel his pain and disappointment. Tom is a man with boyish ideals, coming to terms with the grief of rejection. He teaches her how one loves, yet she never learns to except and give as selflessly. Probably because, as I and Tom have painfully learned, you can't teach or bequile someone as you would a child into doing love 'properly.' And sometimes, true love dies, and no sea of tears can change that.<br/><br/>Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel, is fun, beautiful and selfish. Undoubtedly the villain, the film seeks a reversal of standards; the male is now being preyed upon.<br/><br/>Is Tom naive? or is Summer a cruel and self interested girl? <br/><br/>The only thing that really bothered me was the director's incessant need to punctuate scenes of emotional substance with cliché romantic comedy relief. He already broke custom, why conform?"

I thought it might be a thoughtful alternative to the chick flicks she would prefer to see.<br/><br/>It is safe to say this film did not live up to my expectations. I found a lot of it very contrived and cringe worthy. The voice over was bordering on embarrassing. The attempts at humour were more miss than hit. The characterisation was lacking, particularly in the case of the male lead's friends. <br/><br/>The ""alternative take"" on boy meets girl, although present through out the film, was only really touched on towards the end and I think a lot more could have been made of it with better plot and editing. The love only becoming ""unrequited"" in the last 15 minutes and the director struggling to point out to the viewer the signs that we may well have missed.<br/><br/>All in all it was obvious what the film was trying to achieve but the fact that it was so obvious was its greatest failing. It simply tried too hard and failed too often.<br/><br/>Credit where credit is due I enjoyed the Bollywood style scene and thought it was quite well used in the film, although perhaps stretched a little far with the addition of the animated blue bird. A case of too many influences spoil the broth.<br/><br/>In my opinion this film would have been better served going to the same sort of route as Garden State and similar ""emotional male"" films instead of striving so hard in futility to strike out on its own."

","This is the story of boy meets girl, but it is not a love story that will unfurl. Instead a story about loves reactions, caused by two peoples juvenile actions<br/><br/>A little rhyme I wrote in honor of this years funniest and most delightful film. In January 2009 I was able to attend the Sundance Film Festival where I viewed a number of superb movies but none so genius as this one. Unable to buy or book any tickets for the original showings I sadly set my thoughts on other films, till the last day. I had changed plans and went to the ticket office to exchange one movie ticket for another. It was then that I discovered they planned to screen another showing of 500 Days of Summer, due to its immense popularity. Immediately buying a ticket, I found myself in the theater a few hours later awaiting with batted breath. I looked around me and watched as Joseph Gorden Levitt took a seat in the row behind, smiling and shaking hands with a number of fans. Although I too was a great fan I couldn't bring myself to go over there, instead I stayed in my seat and the movie started.<br/><br/>An hour and a half later, I was standing up and applauding for all I was worth. In fact the whole cinema was, with every single audience member whistling, clapping and laughing at the brilliance of it all. Then Joseph Gorden Levitt, (the only cast member of the film who showed up) ran on stage and started answering questions. Bubbling with enthusiasm he jumped around, laughing, yelling, and keeping the lot of us entertained. He answered the straight questions with straight answers and the silly questions with straight out of hell silly answers. And at the end ran up and down the stage filming us all with a camcorder, saying he'd remember the day forever, I sure do.<br/><br/>Then he went back to his seat and as everyone exited the cinema I swallowed my pride, walked up and shook his hand saying, ""Amazing performance, you're an inspiration."" Then it was over, I found myself being shuffled with the crowd out of the theater and into the cold outside. But even though I was in a t-shirt, I couldn't feel the chill, being instead caught up in the entertainment and thoughts of a vibrant funny film. <br/><br/>A film that scores high in all the boxes and one I will certainly see again.<br/><br/>100 out of 100."

","This movie deserves a spot next to ""When Harry Met Sally"" in my DVD collection. The movie jumps back and forth in the storyline, which was a clever way to lay out the plot, but you have to pay attention, so you can keep track of how much time elapses between various key events. Great use of music. It's not explicitly stated, but the story is told from the perspective of the male lead, Tom, and thus neither you nor Tom ever quite understand why the female lead (Summer) feels or acts the way she does. This is important to know, because this is how things are in real life and often leads to frustration, especially if ""Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."" Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a perfect job of making the viewer feel every high and low on Tom's 500-day journey, and Zooey Deschanel gives Summer the qualities of being both approachable and unattainable."

","500 Days of Summer is a film that does not contain a single interesting idea although it tries so hard to say something. Films without a great message, even simple love films, are fine but the problem here: even a Hugh Grant film contains more humor, originality and soul. The events in 500 days of Summer are predictable (and even the narrative device of jumping back and forth in time cannot conceal it), the relationship between the protagonists are completely superficial, and there is not even one single interesting scene or even detail in this film. Summer and Tom are running through IKEA stores, singing Karaoke and sitting in the park. They talk about boring things in a pseudo-philosophical tone. To give a bit of an ""edge"" to it you got some reference to 1980s alternative music and Bergman films. Everything is in vain: the lack of chemistry between the lead actors (and their lack of talent) and the highly in-original script make this film a failure. Isn't there anything interesting to say about love anymore?"

","This film is about the mysterious relationship between a guy called Tom and his female friend called Summer.<br/><br/>I have heard so many positive word of mouth about ""(500) Days of Summer"", so I was very disappointed during and after watching it. Zooey Deschanel has vastly improved in her variety of facial expressions displayed, but still she looks like a cardboard cut out that tries too hard to be cute and fresh. The story is boring, plain and not engaging. The way that the story is delivered is unconventional, but it is not as groundbreaking as people think. Fortunately, Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a good performance, so it saves the film from being unwatchable. I find ""(500) Days of Summer"" very overrated."

","The only thing that carries this film is the sweet-natured hope of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character that he will find his love returned by Summer, aka (in his romantic mind) THE ONE. Without this universal desire for love, the filmmaker has no hooks in the audience to sit there for the manipulation that ensues. For a bit I thought this rom-com was going to buck the trend and end up worthwhile. No, it fell apart completely the more you thought about it. Summer was ""honest"" with Tom about her unwillingness to commit, but then she just proceeded to toy with him right up to the final scene in the park. Why was she even there (married and pregnant)? ""I've always loved this place since you showed it to me."" Then the bitch rubs his nose in how she came to know he wasn't ""the one"".

","(500) Days Of Summer is a beautifully woven story around two ordinary people. In the beginning only the narrator bluntly says: ""She's who he's been searching for. This is a story about boy meets girl. But you should know that this is not a love story..""<br/><br/>Whatever this may not be, this is a story about love. The feeling of true love is captured by the timelessness of the film. It only chronicles 500 days of Tom (Joseph Levitt) with Summer (the amazing Zooey Deschanel). The first time director Marc Webb gives a story that is too real. The dialogues are not so memorable and you can't actually quote it, but it is an amazing narration with its back & forth story-telling. Though the film is in IMDb's Top 250, I don't think it deserves to get into it because there are way more films which are more better than this.<br/><br/>The friends of Tom were caricatures, but I loved his sister Rachael (Chloe Moretz). She was a breath of fresh air in this film. And there is a Bollywood song and dance routine in the film when Tom spends the night with Summer. I am an Indian and I do like some dance and songs in Indian films. I don't go to see a Hollywood movie to see our style of dance. You may like the song and dance in the film, but I didn't like it. Summer's character could have been better etched out. Why did she leave him when she told him she was happy with him? She has a commitment phobia, but this vanishes in the ending for some trite reason. Zooey is a very likable person in all her movies and I love the way her eyes are - all big & blue like the ocean. She can also act and she and Levitt are going to have very good careers in Hollywood. <br/><br/>And the cinematography was excellent. I heard the director was a video song director and his creativity shows in every frame. I couldn't end this without talking about the songs. What a glorious infusion of music in the story. All the songs were good and fit perfectly. If one hears the soundtrack, you can almost guess the story. I still give it an 8 on 10 because of the acting and direction and timelessness of the film - ""I am the hero of this story, don't need to be saved..."""
"CranberriAppl","Null","19","32","19 September 2010"," It wasn't horrible, but an average rating of 8 is excessively generous.
","I would give it between 5/6 out of 10. The movie was very watchable, kept my interest, had a cool filming style, but I just felt meh about it. First: the acting. Now I remember as a kid going to see JGL in 'Angels in the Outfield,' so he's an actor that while I'm no huge fan, I'll watch his movies. He's charming in the role of a love-sick, naive young guy. I especially got a kick out of the dancing scene. A totally random scene, but it reminded me of how occasionally when we are extra happy, we start dancing. In our rooms, in the copy room at work..sometimes we just get happy. As for Zooey D, I don't see her appeal. I don't seek out her movies, but every movie I've seen her in, she's a quirky, flakey, Mary Sue. Is it always the role or is some of it her real self poking through? I don't know. However, it reminds me of Drew Barrymore....she just has a ditzy quality that gets tiresome when it's in every movie I see that she happens to be in. I also didn't find her to be the best-looking lady in the movie, so all of the intro in the beginning about her was a bit hollow. I thought the redhead blind date was much more attractive even if she had 5 mins of screen time. This plays into the Mary Sue aspect of Summer's character. <br/><br/>As for the story, it was clear that the movie would end up being about how he got over Summer. OK fine, I was looking forward to that. However, the execution left a little to be desired. Tom definitely allowed himself to be used by Summer, however, I'm of the opinion that had she gone beyond her initial ""I don't want a relationship,"" and nipped everything completely in the bud, he would have gotten the hint. Summer had zero redeemable qualities in my eyes. She definitely used his feelings to her benefit, and if the roles were reversed, Tom would be the quintessential jerk. She was highly manipulative and she just strung him along. Something was definitely wrong with her in that she was OK using him KNOWING his feelings w/her. It was easier to identify with Tom and all his ridiculous naivety bc he was emotional. We knew his motivations, but did not know hers. When I watch movies, whether I like characters or not, I feel writers should give us inclinations as to their motivation. Note: this doesn't make them likable, it just makes them more understandable. There's absolutely no reason to act ""relationship-y"" with a person whom you KNOW wants it when you don't. After a fight where the guy/girl is upset bc he feels that you're in a relationship but you won't admit that it kinda is....only a girlfriend/boyfriend figure goes over to that person's house in the middle of the night and sleeps with them. Not a person who wishes to have boundaries. None of her behavior said ""friends."" <br/><br/>The part of the movie that killed it for me was when she got married and told Tom that with the new hubby ""she was sure of what she wasn't sure of w/Tom."" *Cue head scratching* So was that a throwaway ""insightful"" line or was she lying when she said she didn't want a relationship? She got married very soon after she met Tom, so w/that scene, the writers negated a lot of personality and just made her a completely unlikeable character.<br/><br/>The ending was a bit cheesy, but whatever. It's a decent movie to pass time, but you'll probably leave with the same ""meh"" feeling I did."

The 500 has parentheticals around it...why? Trying too hard to be quirky? That's what I thought. Every scene look contrived. Every thing in the movie was unrealistic. Nothing happens the way the movie depicts it. There is an implication there is depth to character and story, but there is no real depth shown. Tom's friends come off as lame-no way I'm buying those 3 are buddies. As much as I like those actors, the writers did a terrible job of character creation. That goes for most all characters in the film. The Bollywood number came out of nowhere and really messed up any sort of mood the film had set, although, there was no consistent tone, it was all out of place. The non-linear order of the film made the film choppy and honestly, the average viewer is not going to keep up with a film like that, especially mindless drivel like this one. Perhaps the only thing about the movie that tries to redeem it is Deschanel's cute karaoke performance. The film only captures quirkiness, but never comes to own it."
"Kicky05","10","20","35","12 August 2009"," ""I'm the hero of this story. I don't need to be saved.""
","(5oo) Days of Summer can be summed up as Juno meets Annie Hall. The film's plot concerns an employee for a greeting card company (Tom) who can't escape his previous relationship with a girl named Summer, played by the talented Zooey Deschanel. Bits and pieces of their relationship are presented to the film viewer–out of sequence–as Tom tries to discover why everything fell apart, what he can do to get Summer back, and if love actually exists. I know. It sounds bland, but this one has several elements that push it far beyond the run-of-mill.<br/><br/>First, the acting is simply incredible. As I said before, Levitt wowed me with his spot-on Sam Spade impersonation in Rian Johnson's homage to noir films: Brick. In (500) Days however, Levitt sheds his hard boiled detective act and trades it in for the sensitivity and bitterness of Holden Caufield. The sensitive male role is a performance that's often exaggerated to the point where the audience often finds themselves annoyed–and even hating–the character. Levitt's Tom never losses his sympathetic appeal even when his obsession verges on obnoxious behavior in the latter part of the film.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschannel is incredible as a thinly veiled Annie Hall clone–Summer. She's the product of a broken home, independent, blunt with her sexuality and incredibly beautiful. This could have been such a simple role to botch. Nothing that Summer says is particularly witty or catchy, but Deschannel (just as Diane Keaton with Annie Hall) manages to make her such an intriguing character through her physical presence . Summer is not only a character that must be watched, but one that must also be read. She must be read through her facial expressions, how she moves her body, and–especially–how she looks at Tom when she's speaking to him or he is speaking to her.<br/><br/>The actors aren't the only ones who should be praised. Marc Webb does quite an impressive job with his directorial debut–probably the best since Zach Braff's Garden State. This story could have easily fallen to pieces in the hand of even a seasoned director but Webb rises to the challenge with the talent of virtuoso. The cinematography is never over-the-top or artsy just for the sake of being artsy. Every shot, every angle, and every neat little trick that Webb employs has its purpose. Hopefully, this film marks the beginning of a young and talented auteur's superb career.<br/><br/>I feel that it would be wrong not to mention the soundtrack. After all, Tom's attraction to Summer blossoms when she displays her knowledge of the Smith's catalog. The experience simply would not be nearly as enthralling without the music. Every song serves its accompanying scene splendidly and helps the viewer connect with the two leads. I would say that it's even better than the Juno and Garden State soundtracks simply because those soundtrack are more like stellar mix CDs than anything else–there is no theme or running emotion connecting the songs together. (500) Days is a different story. You can almost decipher the story just from listening to the soundtrack. The beginning tracks that deal with the yearning for a crush and the utter joy of ending up with that crush, the middle section of the CD that encompasses the fading of the joy and the eventual disintegration of the relationship, and the final portion of the soundtrack that deals with recovery from and acceptance of the lost relationship. Ultimately, it's an emotion provoking selection of music that's as vital to the movie as the acting and the directing. I would argue that (500) Days of Summer is destined to become a modern classic film, ranking along side Milk, There Will Be Blood, Garden State, Children of Men, American Psycho, and Little Miss Sunshine. Why? It's not because it's a particularly quotable film or that it's an innovative movie with some neat camera tricks. Instead, I think it will because it has a soul. It's a movie that takes a snapshot of love in the modern world and bravely presents it without removing any of the blemishes."

After I started watching this film and became bored I looked it up on IMDb and checked out recommendations for people who like this film, and wouldn't you know it they recommended several other films that I DID NOT like. ""He's not that into you"" was even worse than 500 days, which is really saying something. Also recmnd' was Titanic (yuck) 5 hrs of boredom.<br/><br/>it would be cool if there was an actual story to grasp onto, like PS I Love You. now that was an incredible movie. or like ""Feast of Love"" I would rather watch anything else including cspan rather than watch this again."
"purplebairn","Null","9","14","9 December 2009"," a really miserable film
","Well I had high hopes of this film, yet I was totally disappointed. I knew what to expect in the movie, but nothing prepared me for the utterly awful character played by Deschanel. She plays a hideous, self-absorbed, self-important user who endears herself to no one, and she is a totally hypocritical liar to boot. I know she is 'of a type' but that doesn't mean anyone is going to like this character. I certainly didn't, and I found this to be one of the least life-affirming films of the year. The male lead (played by a lifeless doormat) really needs a reality check from the first minute. Avoid this unless you enjoy feeling miserable. Its not big and its not clever."
"angie-fox","1","11","18","11 April 2012"," 3 years have passed and I still ask myself why I watched this!
","This story is about two superficial characters and... I want to be brief: this was the worst movie I ever saw (and I watch many movies).<br/><br/>I heard people saying this was a ""great movie"" so, while watching it, my boyfriend and I were waiting for a ""great"" scene to come, but it never came. This movie only causes anger to the people who watch it, it's a threat to human intelligence. I don't see a romantic comedy here. Maybe this can be a comedy or romance for people who never were in a fun and interesting relationship.<br/><br/>This movie should be on Guinness Records for having so many clichés, since playing on IKEA to saying dirty words out loud in public places. I saw things I also did when I was younger turned into an insult, so superficial and unfunny I couldn't even smile the whole movie."

","I was ready to sleep after 10 minutes of this dreck. The characterization of the ""men"" in this film were far from developed and as for the story - fine, a little twist in the romance comedy theme is welcome but this film offered a sleepy boring rendition of ""it's not you, it's me"" and the narrative voice-overs; increases the IV drip now!! I will say that visually it's well done film making. Nice camera views and angles with maybe an overdone design sensitivity. The non linear sequence of time tries to keep you from dozing i.e. you need to pay some attention to the juxtaposition of scenes. My wife left the room before I did so maybe it's an appealing storyline to a 20 something something... avoid unless you need a good night's sleep."
"docudrama67","3","30","60","19 July 2009"," Why was this movie made?
","First of all, for all the hoopla by some critics and film festival types this is not a very good movie. It really isn't.<br/><br/>The script lacks even the slightest insight to how relationships really work, but still tries to have its cake by having the Tom character make a big speech at the end of the film about how movies and pop songs screw up everyone's expectations of what love is.<br/><br/>I'll tell you what love isn't. An emotionally stunted man-boy trying to have a relationship with a girl who is most likely has a borderline personality disorder.<br/><br/>The film was not without it's charms, Gordon-Levitt was a very likable and engaging, the soundtrack was pleasant to listen to and the film had a handful of sitcom style ""funny"" lines. But if you've ever watched an episode or two of How I Met Your Mother or Big Bang Theory you've heard them all before.<br/><br/>Fortunately for the filmmakers, the festivals types who eat up this drivel refuse to watch popular television on principal and they will therefore think this film is original and clever.<br/><br/>But overall, the film dragged on forever, Zoe Deschannel (who I adore) looked old in the film and had almost nothing to do, and the little quirky visual bits were straight out of the Sundance film festival handbook.<br/><br/>Fox Searchlight will probably score a minor hit with this nonsense, but in ten years no one will remember this slight, immature little flick."

","Wonderful movie. From the trailer it may appear like your typical boringly predictable romantic comedy, but in reality is a great comedy-drama, with great meaning and relevance, and an amazing twist. <br/><br/>Clever plot - not at all predictable, and very original. Direction is equally innovative, switching between different periods of time deftly, seamlessly and to the betterment of the movie. <br/><br/>The choice of lead actors was inspired. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are superb in the lead roles. The chemistry is spot-on, and both are suitably quirky and non-mainstream, avoiding it becoming a common-or-garden shmaltzy romance.<br/><br/>Topping it all off is a superb soundtrack. The music, excellent in isolation, is integrated perfectly into the movie, and is not overdone. <br/><br/>A must-see."

Inconsistencies in personalities of the girl which she seems had few, simply threw everything out of picture where he is simply begging her to be with him - she does not want it... dull moments are all over the movie and the end movie scene is - he meets another girl... kind of opening for another movie on the same dull moments and no original story.<br/><br/>But hey, that's only my opinion - it seems critics liked it since it was nominated for awards..."

The writers tried to be clever but never got past cliché. His friends have no depth what so ever. They were played by good actors but since they were nothing more than props their antics seemed embarrassing at best. She, according to the premise was supposed to be a head turner.

A waste of time. a waste of money."
"garyzaboly","10","13","23","28 September 2010"," A Guy's Romance Flick
","Romance movies are generally considered ""chick flicks,"" because they're usually seen from the female point of view. But ""(500) DAYS OF SUMMER"" is clearly a guy's film because it delineates all the joys and sorrows of falling in love from one young man's perspective. Remarkably, I found myself relating entirely with the main character, because back in 1980 I had also fallen for a co-worker, and she just happened to resemble Zooey Deschanel---even down to her hairstyle in this movie! And while it wasn't 500 days of her for me---more like 90 days---all the deep feelings, joys, heady romance, and ultimate disappointment as shown in this film WAS there. So now, even 3 decades later, this film was very meaningful for me. What made it even better was that it was done very creatively; kudos to all involved for their originality of script, cinematography, and editing, and of course all the players are superb in conveying the ups and downs of romance---or at least of deep love that's ultimately and disconcertingly not returned with equal fervor."
"MovieZoo","4","17","32","9 August 2009"," 500 Days of Summer: I counted them just to stay awake
","In trying to determine how I will write this review, I decided to start off with honesty. Honesty was a big problem with this movie. One person thought honesty opened a direct line to an excuse for escape, while another relied on honesty to cement the relationship that this movie was about. And it was that cement that took this relationship to the bottom. For me, honesty means I am stuck with telling the truth about my feelings for this movie. I am terribly disappointed. In one word, B-O-R-I-N-G.<br/><br/>I can never say anything bad about Zooey Deschanel but I hated her character, Summer Finn. At first sight she was cute but one moment later, there was a sense of danger for this charming beauty. She obviously stood out as standoffish at that point but later weakened and became deliciously accessible. It was a cycle that repeated more than a couple times in the movie. I have seen this kind of flipping before and nothing good ever came of it.<br/><br/>I have so little to say about Tom because, well, he was indeed the whipping post he was made out to be.<br/><br/>While there are so many positive comments about this movie, I have to admit I do not see it. To me this movie was a clinical observation on the process of love - nothing inspirational. Whatever hope you may have for either of the main characters, it is quickly made obvious that only one character deserves the benefits of hope...the whipping post. This movie did more to separate one of the hope for, need and meaning of love than to encourage the feelings of love.<br/><br/>If you want to see a reality tainted yet soul-immersing movie that draws someone into the world where love is something that hurts and heals, see About Last Night. It's an oldie but it is what I hoped this movie would be similar to.<br/><br/>I give this a 4 out of 10 and all points go to Zooey."
"straty02","4","11","19","9 January 2010"," Promising beginning becomes an utter bore
","This films begins well. A nice light romantic type film with each character evolving as the film progresses. The two lead actors kept me interested for the first 30 minutes. However, half way through the movie I kept thinking 'this guy is pathetic' and 'she is a real pain in the ass'. I still think that Zooey Deschanel is a fine actress and a very attractive woman but I simply wanted to strangle her during the course of this movie. I would have DUMPED HER in a heartbeat!! The friends of the male lead have been done to death so many times before, goofy, nerdy pals asking the usual sexual type questions at the beginning of the relationship but also there to provide the support when things go wrong. The use of the little sister as the counsel for the male lead (and his dopey mates) only made his character seem more pathetic.<br/><br/>I did expect some kind of comedy to emerge but no, it became mindless romantic dribble that made it very difficult to stay awake. It also made me realize that the review scores on IMDb are a total illusion! An 8! you have got to be kidding me?? A very uninspiring movie to say the least, give this one a miss folks"
"grahamclarke","5","11","19","10 November 2009"," Great chemistry wasted on a very, very flimsy movie
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are amongst the more interesting actors of their generations. Levitt wisely chooses roles that challenge and as a result he's developed into a fine young actor with great potential for future projects. Deschanel's delightful off centre kookiness somehow does not wear off. They work really well together, which is ultimately what makes ""500 Days of Summer"" something of a let down. Had their roles been played by lesser talents this movie would surely not have attracted much attention. The chemistry between these intriguing leads is wasted on this very, very flimsy movie.<br/><br/>You may enjoy it as it passes before you're eyes, but the next day you'll most likely have forgotten it completely.

While I know that we the general public are dubious in our ability to separate good from bad , one would expect the critics to put us straight. When the lead ""adult"" shows less emotional maturity than his 11 year old sister you know you are in trouble. The film irritatingly flips through the scenes of a relationship with an attending cast one would happily avoid any contact with. <br/><br/>The bewildering array of sub-themes, introduced and just as quickly dropped, the 1960s, art house films, architecture etc. just add to the confusion of the hotchpotch plot. <br/><br/>As a film I would struggle to give it 5, as an experience it is really one I wish I had avoided.

I don't think the story is happy or cheerful, but I do think it has many realistic points, I mean, who never stayed (stealing another user's terms) in a ""I love you more than you love me"" relationship? It's a complicated situation, specially when one person is completely in love, making wedding plans and the other one cannot even imagine to spend four days in a roll with you.<br/><br/>The way the story is told, jumping the days back and forward is very interesting too, because we can compare better the mood changes from Tom and the problems in his relationship with Summer.<br/><br/>PS: I don't like Summer.

"veeshl","7","9","15","1 September 2009"," Not up to snuff
","Based on the current IMDb ratings, I was expecting a lot - something on par with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I was expecting something clever, artistic, thought-provoking, and - most of all - insightful. Not so, unfortunately. Reasons: 1. Dialogue - not witty, not clever (and I was expecting wit out the wazoo from this movie). The characters offered nothing profound about their emotional turmoil, their angst. The one diatribe that the main character has in the middle of the movie is the same clichéd piffle about unrequited love that we've heard a million times already (""*boo hoo* what does the word love mean? Why don't we say what we feel?""). Tom - the main character - is incapable of answering these questions, and his monologue is nothing more than whining. Zooey's character is quirky in her dress and style, but her intelligence or attitudes are not particularly quirky.... unless you call playing the penis game in the park quirky. 2. Emotional depth of characters - I think this relates to the shallow dialogue, but the characters - especially the guy - don't seem capable of thinking about, say, the cosmic significance of their emotions. They're content being slaves to their feelings, and, like automatons, perform the expected rituals, asking profound questions such as ""what's going on between us? Like, what are we?"" (referring to the boyfriend-girlfriend question). That's the most thought provoking question that Tom Hansen can come up with. Not unusual, not unique, not clever. Likewise with Summer's response.<br/><br/>I give the film credit for the way the anachronistic story-telling, which made it feel like a mystery movie. And it had a few clever moments, like the dance scene in the park.<br/><br/>I'm being hard on this movie because it's made its way into the IMDb Top 250. The other movies in the top 250 are life-altering movie-going experiences: they affect the way you think about the world. Each one a revolution in film-making and/or story-telling. Consistently. (500) Days of Summer fails in both of these.<br/><br/>Save your money. If you want a thought-provoking love story, go rent ""Eternal Sunshine."""
"wmjaho","9","29","61","19 January 2009"," A delightfully refreshing take on romantic comedy.
","What a delightful film. From the opening screen, which offers a very funny disclaimer, it is clear that 500 Days of Summer dares to be different. And as the opening sequence clearly states, it is not a love story. Except that's only a technicality. It really is. Sort of.<br/><br/>Writers Scott Neustadter and Michael Webber, along with director Marc Webber, have put together a charming, fresh and very funny romantic comedy. Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) start an office romance when Summer comes to LA from Michigan for an internship at a greeting card company. Tom writes cards, although he quietly aspires to be an architect. Tom is a romantic idealist who has never found his soul mate. Summer is a disillusioned pragmatist who doesn't believe in love. But Summer immediately takes to Tom, Tom is smitten with Summer and their relationship proceeds as so many do in the movies.<br/><br/>Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt play their roles well, although it occurred to me more than once that they lacked chemistry. But remember, this is not a love story, which is what makes 500 Days of Summer more realistic and poignant than what we have come to expect from the movies. But it is a refreshing and thought-provoking take on what we often describe as being in loveabout taking risks, dealing with disappointments, finding yourself and bumping into fate when you least expect it.<br/><br/>The film includes a couple of movie-making devices that some might find distracting. It uses a timeline to tell the story, but jumps forward and back, which still manages to effectively provide a narrative without feeling like a contrivance. In contrast, the film also pays homage to a number of classic movies, including several clips and snippets, which feels out of place and doesn't quite fit.<br/><br/>As currently constructed, 500 Days of Summer will get an R rating. If they can edit it to a PG-13, which would be quite easily done, it could do nicely at the box office.<br/><br/>Notes from Sundance: At opening night at the Eccles Center, Deschanel commented on how attracted she was to the script. Director Marc Webber made the point that he wanted to shoot on location in LA, but show a bit of the city's architectural heritage, which did very subtly separate 500 Days from typical Hollywood-Indie fare."

","I was forced to watch this when it first came out because my best friend liked it somehow. Almost couldn't forgive this. None of the characters are particularly likable or even stand out. It's just dull. And the movie is built around you feeling for this dude, but you can't empathize for him because he's a freaking loon. Zooey (whose character's name I had forgotten until I remembered the name of the movie) tells that guy (who cares what his name is) exactly what her expectations are and he just can't handle it. But the movie acts like we're supposed to side with that guy as if Summer keeps playing games with him-even though she repeatedly tells him exactly what she's looking for to make sure he doesn't get the wrong idea. And that is the plot. Which is less exciting than watching this guy break plates with a frown. Which is the highlight of this movie. And what's with the parentheses on (500)? Hipster garbage. I hate it so much. Zooey is always a cute person but I can't even like her in this. World, listen to me. Let's all agree not to include this movie in any time capsules or culture pods sent into space so that if some apocalypse does occur we can at least have the silver lining of knowing this movie ended with the rest of the world. 2 stars for Zooey.

The couple meet, get to know one another, date, and part in the course of five-hundred days, while director Marc Webb zips us through different stages of their relationship in a semi-random manner (which Webb probably intended as a fresh way to define the peaks and valleys of modern romance). Age-appropriate viewers, tired of Woody Allen or Nora Ephron-penned romantic comedy-dramas, will no doubt see traces of themselves portrayed earnestly here, yet the film is hardly inventive. The college-rock soundtrack is flavorful, and is usually around to pick up the slack, yet Neustadter and Weber fall back on some very derivative character-driven scenes and dialogue (while the proviso that leading lady Zooey Deschanel prefers being alone to dating is a lazy out, rendered inconsequential by the finale). The picture looks good and sounds good, though it is itself a fairy tale--one topped with a happy bow. Gullible teenagers are its target audience. ** from ****"

500 days of summer (2009):
The movie is a reflection of modern love stories. It's completely opposite of so called reel love stories which are highlighted in books and cinemas but it is so real. Everybody having a love life and break up can completely relate to it. It tells us that, ""People grow in life and sometimes they grow apart. It doesn't mean the love which was shared wasn't true. It's just a one part and fate of life but it's NOT THE END."
"callanvass","9","2","2","6 March 2010"," Finally a fully original Romantic&Comedy!. Funny,wonderfully downbeat, and informative.
","(500) Days Of Summer is one of the most brilliant, original, and refreshing romantic comedies I have ever seen. Year after year, we get the same old tired formula, only in different ways, and while I do enjoy some of them, they do get tiring after a while, because it's so utterly predictable. Here I couldn't predict a thing, even when I thought I could. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel make one of the most intriguing and original couples in sometime, showing us how relationships are not fairy tales like the movies make it out to be, and how tough it really is. I also liked how almost every day passed, a screen would show up saying what day it was at, I thought that was a unique addition.<br/><br/>SPOILER: If you don't wanna know, please don't read any further.<br/><br/>500 Days also has to be quite possibly, the only original romantic comedy, that doesn't have your typical happy ending. Tom and Summer don't get together. Tom's hard work does NOT pay off, and Summer ends up getting married, which I didn't expect. 500 Days of Summer tries to show us there are no fairy tales, or miracles, but by showing Tom meeting another woman at a meeting at the end of the film, it also shows things aren't totally disastrous.<br/><br/>Performances. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is turning out to be one of the great up and coming actors, proving there is hope for the new generation. Here he is convincingly in love, and I could relate to him 100%. It also helps that his heart is pure, and he has a unique sense of humor. Zooey Deschanel is charming, and really good, but if I have a mild complaint, it's her character was very cold and manipulative sometimes. Geoffrey Arend is very funny as Tom's best friend McKenzie. He was goofy, but likable.<br/><br/>Bottom line. (500) Days Of Summer is now one of my favorite Rom com's. It's original, it's funny, it's downbeat, and I can't find many bad things to say about it. It really opened up my eyes for relationships, and it shows not every romance is a fairytale waiting to happen, not matter how deep the love is. A must see, and one of the best films of 2009.<br/><br/>9/10"

"hughman55","10","11","20","29 July 2010"," Come here/Go away
","When the moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter aligns with Mars -- you get ""500 Days of Summer"". This is one of those rare films where everything lined up perfectly and the results are stunning. Where do you start with a movie this good? Anywhere! <br/><br/>Memories: They come to us out of order. We remember endings, and then we remember beginnings. We remember last month, then last year, then yesterday. Sometimes we revel in our memories. Sometimes they kick us in the stomach. And that is how this story is told to brilliant effect. Out of chronological order. And, from the front car of a speeding roller coaster. <br/><br/>This is a SWEET film!!! And it could not have been cast better than with Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt. Deschanel plays Summer Finn. She's alluring and desirable while maintaining a flat, detached affect that only makes her more desirable to all who come in contact with her. Words float from her mouth when she speaks as if to denote a subtle indifference. Holding her hand could cause yours to feel empty. Like holding the hand of a ghost. It's her way to be there, and not be there. She likes it that way. It's safe. <br/><br/>Deschanel is brilliant at this and totally believable as Levitt's, unattainable, object of desire. Levitt is wonderfully lost in love for this ""perfect"" girl. He is confused, bedazzled, and depressed - he's in love. He navigates all of the roller coaster stages of his characters head on collision with love with deftness and poignancy. I can not imagine any two other actors doing this movie greater justice. <br/><br/>There are so many good moments in this movie it might be inappropriate to single out just one over the plethora of others. But I will anyway. It is a beautifully subtle scene with Summer and Tom sitting in a theater watching the final scene of the movie ""The Graduate"" with Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross. Hoffman and Ross have escaped the chaotic world around them. It's just the two of them now, holding hands, moving ahead into the sunset. Seeing this, Summer (Deschanel), becomes emotional, surprising both herself and Tom. What happens in those few moments is at the heart of this film. And it's importance could almost go by unnoticed because it's done so delicately. As this moment is unfolding we already know everything about Tom. He has no secrets. From the start of this film his chest cavity is wide open with his beating heart on full display. Summer, on the other hand, is all secrets. But when the clock strikes this moment, we learn one of them. It's sweet. It's sad. It's revealing. And, I thought, very powerful because it changes everything we think we know about her up to this point. It also sets up perfectly the beautiful, but perhaps not ""happy"", ending that is soon to come.<br/><br/>In the opening credits, the narrator explains that this is a ""boy meets girl"" story, but that it's not a ""love story"". Well, I don't know about that. I think this is a love story. And a good one. The script is genius. The direction is sharp but never heavy handed. The music plays through the action in perfect accompaniment with the story. There is nothing not to like about this gem. Everyone in the world has lived through this relationship at some point in their life. It's the one that makes you stronger, as it almost kills you. Yes, that one. Here's what it looks like as a movie. A good movie."
"miss_lady_ice-853-608700","2","10","18","26 September 2010"," (500) Days of Tedium
","I watched this film based on a recommendation- big disappointment.<br/><br/>The basic plot- our loser protagonist (Joseph Gordon Levitt, who did an okay job considering he had to play a dull young man) is crazy about Summer (Zooey Deschanel, who is suitably kooky). The actors are not the downfall- the downfall is the director and the screenplay.<br/><br/>It is so obvious that this film is semi-autobiographical, a sort of whiny revenge. It's a bit like that clingy new kid who really wants you to like him and hang out and be cool together- but his attempts to be cool and kooky are so forced that the film becomes very strained.<br/><br/>Attempts at kookiness include an 'alternative' soundtrack (so we think the film is quirky and alternative, despite it being formulaic and predictable), the play on Summer in the title (it's like a season but also her name, ha ha!) and the tagline (""This is not a love story-this is a story about love."" Actually, it is a love story- just a rather dull one with lots of cod philosophy about love- cos he works in a greetings card company! Ha ha, isn't that funny and cute?). The ending is so sickeningly 'cute', you might actually throw up.<br/><br/>The structure of the film is terrible. It's done out like a series of vignettes, which is fine. The technique creates little snapshot moments-perfect for the premise of the film. Conveniently it papers over the cracks the film has as a whole, so you're left with a very bitty film. Sometimes you'll get a good vignette (the one where the couple are playing house in IKEA)but often you will get dull ones. Then there's a countdown of the 500 days, which is done practically a week at a time, but the time gap varies- all it does is drag the pace. Then we have the ill-judged voice-over narrator, an idea which is as awful as it sounds. And the screenplay is incredibly poor- one wonders if it wasn't written by a bad film student, because it is supposedly arty but bears no resemblance to how people actually speak or behave.<br/><br/>If you like Zooey Deschanel, you might like this film. If you have low expectations of films, by all means watch this. For an alternative teen/young person film, watch Pretty in Pink. For a negative film about love, you could watch Closer or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?...there's loads of films out there that live up to their promise. Sadly this film falls short."

","Do you have any idea how many terrible, dry romantic comedies there have been this past decade. Its almost uncountable.

But then, this miracle came along. ""(500) Days of Summer"" is an absolute fresh and original film. This is solely original. Its not the usual fall in love, break-up, get back together romantic comedy. Not at all. This film makes you feel good. And its smart. It recounts the 500 days of a relationship that went wrong. Its about a man who wants a woman to love him when she doesn't believe in love. How fresh is that! You might as well call this the freshest comedy ever made. I'm not kidding. I'm not exaggerating. Its totally unique. And its smart. A lot of the things in the film I have never seen before. Go rent this movie RIGHT NOW! You will be amazed and be prepared to laugh! 10 out of 10."

"bobsgrock","10","8","14","20 July 2010"," The most perfect visualization of relationships ever put on film.
","Some films feel like genuine masterpieces that cannot nor ever will be topped by similar films. 500 Days of Summer is such a film; it is so perfectly crafted in its writing, direction, acting, editing and other major departments that after seeing it one feels off kilter, wondering if they had seen a fictional movie (as the title cards read in the opening) or a portal in which the inner workings of a young man and his quest for true love was connected directly to the audience. So strong and powerful was my emotional reaction and connection to this film, it could in many ways alter forever my view of relationships. Is that good or bad? As an indie-budget production, there are really only two sections that can make or break this type of film: writing and acting. The script by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber is as close to perfect as I've ever seen in any film of any genre. The dialogue feels completely accurate and true to the context of the situations of the characters, the situations themselves are real and totally believable and the nonlinear narrative works extremely well in bringing the audience not only into a deeper sympathy with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt character but also in convincing us that a number of these scenes may be dreams. First-time director Marc Webb keeps the tricks to a minimum, using only what is necessary to support the story and not divert from it. The film is tight in its pace, which builds the tension and emotion all the more.<br/><br/>This now brings us to the acting which is, needless to say, flawless. Gordon-Levitt has been a star-in-the-making for a while now but combining this performance with his in Christopher Nolan's Inception proves he is truly one of the best young actors of this generation. He so perfectly handles both the funny and serious moments of Tom Hansen's journey through love, completely believable in every single frame. He is a nice guy so we root for him, but his pain is visceral and tender so we identify with him. He creates one of the best protagonists I have ever seen in a movie. Zooey Deschanel is an actress I have loved ever since she played the perky, blonde singing elf in Elf. However, her game has been raised significantly from such trash as Failure to Launch. She creates a sympathetic character as well but in an entirely different way. Summer is a woman with many events in her life that would lead to her feeling about relationships the way she does. Therefore, it is understandable that she would do what she does in this film. Yet, there is no excuse given to properly and completely understand who and why she does what she does. We only get glimpses; we see her through Tom's eyes and despite her great beauty and quirky personality, there is always the feeling that something deeper lingers below. Needless to say, the chemistry between the two leads is something to behold. It may be a stretch to compare them to legends such as Bogart/Bacall or Grant/Hepburn but I felt completely comfortable and enchanted by both of them, together and individually.<br/><br/>Getting down to it, why is this quite simply the best portrayal of relationships ever put to celluloid? Many would question that statement and it may not be true, but it is most certainly true for this generation that Tom and Summer represent. Here are two people on different paths that happen to cross. Is it fate or coincidence? Each has different views of that and by the end their views are slightly askew. The film would say that it's a little of both. I think that is the best statement the writers and director could make. I have heard many detractors of the film say that it is too sad, that Summer is an unsympathetic person and the ending is completely false. I would simply remark that life is quite often too sad, Summer is sympathetic in a much different way than most romantic-comedy girls and the ending rang true in the sense that Tom's journey isn't over. Many, if not all, guys have been in Tom's shoes. This makes it the best story about love for guys. It also makes it the type of film that when you see it, you feel changed inside.<br/><br/>The vast majority of films in this genre are totally dead and unrealistic. Films like Adventureland and 500 Days of Summer show that with the right script and the right cast, a story can be told that is funny, sad, smart and completely, utterly, totally, indubitably: perfect."
"misterembryo","9","12","24","26 July 2009"," (500) Thumbs Up for Days of Summer
","An opening disclaimer sets the tone for the rest of the movie: ironic and so true. The movie is fun, frustrating, simple, difficult, triumphant, and depressing, much like the nature of any loving relationship. (500) Days of Summer is a traditional love story told in a nontraditional fashion, combining and contrasting over-the-top fantasy with harsh reality. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, boy loves girl, girl doesn't love boy because her divorced parents destroyed the very idea of true love sending the boy into a downward spiral of sorrow and recklessness.<br/><br/>Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an aspiring architect that writes greeting cards for a living. Of course, he has an even greater aspiration to one day find true love, a curse and a blessing that was embedded in his innocent mind after watching ""The Graduate"" at a young and tender age. His life changes completely when a new Executive Assistant joins the office: Summer Finn (the beautiful Zooey Deschanel), and she's like a modern-day Audrey Hepburn. Who wouldn't fall in love with an Audrey Hepburn? A drunken office karaoke session and a long-awaited kiss later, Tom and Summer Finn are goofing off and holding hands at an IKEA. (Aww, Tom and Finn. How cute.) Their relationship is reminiscent of Joel and Clementine from ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind."" Like Eternal, their story is told nonlinearly. We ping-pong between different stages of their relationship, from Day (1) to Day (500), revealing both the beauty and the tragedy of Tom's pursuit to win Summer Finn.<br/><br/>The difference is, Tom doesn't have a machine to erase any trace of Summer, but must instead live with the pain that scarred him so deeply. What Tom does have is a great support system: two close buddies who care for him sincerely but have no clue how to handle this unhealthy situation, and a kid sister who happens to say all the right things.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are perfect in this movie. He is tossed around both emotionally and physically, from extreme highs to terrible lows, and if you don't cheer for him, then you have no heart. She just owns the screen, and everything about her makes it easy to see why a guy would spend (500) days pining for this woman.<br/><br/>There are some amazing moments in this movie, beyond the content. Like Eternal's Michel Gondry, Director Marc Webb started his career making music videos (""All That I've Got"" by The Used and ""I'm Not Okay (I Promise)"" by MCR, amongst other countless greats). It's no wonder why his feature film debut is as artistic and as entertaining as it truly is. This is Day (1) of a film career that is no doubt going to be an enjoyable one to watch."

It also has a cheesy narration track that doesn't work. When Zoe Deschanel does her "" I'm so sexy and hot"" slow motion walk into the camera, I was asking myself:She's hot?

Do so many young people really just think it's that cool to have a film where the couple doesn't live happily ever after? So they're willing to overlook how insipid and shallow the two main characters are? The film, hyped as out of the box, is so predictable in how it is out of the box that it's tedious. Zooey Deschanel does not have an acting bone in her body, and what's-his-name isn't much better, despite his rueful Edward Norton smile (Norton has more talent in his little finger, however, than this guy). I used to believe that any IMDb rating over 7 was watchable, and anything over 8 was good. Not any more."
"zetes","5","11","22","2 August 2009"," Trying so hard it only occasionally works
","Hipster romance/break-up flick starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. At its best, it can be either sweet and insightful or downright heartbreaking. Too bad its best comes around only rarely. Most of the film is made up of wannabe clever moments that make it come off as overly cutesy. Among the aspects the film should have dumped to the wayside: the precocious little sister, the completely useless and unfunny best friends, the constant references to indie music and attempts to win indie cred, the Hall & Oates musical number (an ironic wink to the same people who will swoon over the rest of the soundtrack), the quirky greeting card company and, probably most notably, the final sequence. After excising all that, the film would only run about 45 minutes. About the only bit of cleverness that works is a split scene sequence where, the first time Gordon-Levitt is meeting with Deschanel after their big break-up, his expectations play out in real time against what actually happens. That could have backfired, as so much of the rest of the film does, but Webb directs it so well that the end result is devastating. This happens near the end of the film, and for a while it felt like it was jettisoning cutesiness for real emotion. And then comes the final sequence, which is the worst in recent memory. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has given three of the greatest performances of the current decade in Mysterious Skin, Brick and The Lookout. His character here isn't especially well written, and I think he tries to overcompensate a little. Deschanel, playing the title character, is fairly two dimensional. Webb clearly based the girl on a real ex-girlfriend, and it would have been nice to have this film feel more personal. Instead, it feels like a distant, overwritten indie flick, not too far removed from junk like Juno."
"DavidYZ","1","5","8","25 April 2017"," A confusing, incomplete, haphazard mess
","I love Zooey Deschanel in New Girl, so I was looking forward to watching this - especially because the critics love it. I was massively disappointed by this boring, confusing film which jumps back and forth in time at random, showing a minority of the 500 days of the relationship between the two protagonists. Even if you played the days in order, it would still be severely incomplete and not entertaining. This film was misleadingly promoted as a lighthearted romcom with a likable female lead. In fact, there's very little humour in this miserable drama. It's not sexy or romantic. Neither character is likable and they're not suited as a couple. The acting and writing are awful. <br/><br/>All the way through, Summer says she doesn't believe in love, yet Tom keeps trying to make her fall in love with him. After they split, she quickly falls in love with someone else, which only serves to make her character even more unlikeable."

","500 days of summer blew my expectations. ""This is not a love story"", expressed prominently by the narrator in the opening scene. This single sentence pique my interest early in the movie as that was my initial expectation: a love story. This movie is lovable, its enjoyable, it makes you feel good (not everybody), everything that makes it fun.<br/><br/>I'm usually never impressed my rock or indie soundtracks played in movies as unless I'm a fan of that genre of musician I'll never really get into it in one listening. However, the use of music in this movie is phenomenal, it plays with the tone, mood and general emotion. It guides the audience and moves them along the pacing of the movie. Really good work. Acting is fantastic, I loved both Zooey and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this film. Nothing much to add here, they both acted really well and it helped the immersion.<br/><br/>This movie is fun, that's what I love about it. Sometimes we watch film to loosen up and this movie is for that, it helps us think about things other than our lives for a second and that really helps. It's also helps that the film portrays things that have meaning rather than superficial jokes and gags without substance. It dwells on our life, we can relate with the humour because we understand his predicament. It plays on our habits and our expectations. That's why I love this film. Go watch it!"
"MissFortinbras","8","3","4","29 January 2015"," What happened to happy endings?
","No! No! No! No! No!<br/><br/>500 Days of Summer. The title screams 'happy ending'! That's what I wanted - a happy ending. I felt like a toddler who didn't get her way when things didn't end the way I wanted them to. Arg! <br/><br/>Okay, I love how the film begins with the whole voice-over about how this is not your typical love story. I sat under the covers of my bed and thought, ""Pa-lease! This is just to make me think that it isn't a typical love story when it really is."" Tom believed that he would never truly be happy until he found the love of his life (paraphrasing). The moment that information about him was revealed, I felt an immediate connection with this guy because we are alike in that sense. So I think that is why I especially felt the urgency for him and Summer to get back together.<br/><br/>I loved how the film didn't move in chronological order but rather jumping from 'then' and 'now'. It created parallels in a sense. For example, how we jump from the scene where they are playful in the furniture store to later in their relationship where Summer no longer finds it amusing.My absolute FAVOURITE scene has to be the 'expectation vs reality' scene. That for me was pure genius! <br/><br/>I could go on and on about all the things I liked and did not. I will say this though: the characters play some rather symbolic roles. Summer, as annoying as she is, had the biggest symbolic role. For me, she represents the very concept of summer. It's bright, warm, care-free and fun. It's the season you spend your entire year waiting for. Which leaves me with the impression that their relationship was sort of like a summer fling. <br/><br/>No, this movie didn't have the perfect ending every good love story has. But notice how Tom's new chapter only begun once he had gotten closure with Summer and wished her well with her husband. If Summer (the season) was a party, then Autumn would be reality that checks in the morning after. But Autumn has an understated beauty about it. A beauty we only appreciate once we let go of Summer. I don't know. I wish I could explain myself better but I loved this movie because it didn't end perfectly. It ended realistically and that it in itself had an understated beauty that I grew to appreciate once I let go of the perfect ending I wanted so badly."
"pushbuttonopenmind","8","3","4","31 October 2013"," ""Did she break your heart, or did you?""
","(500) Days of Summer is a refreshing rom-com that sidesteps the standard: 'boy and girl separated (by e.g. family, society, misunderstandings, gossip, war, monsters, time-zones, ...) and their struggle to get a first kiss, end scene' narrative. It skips forward, and rather asks 'so, what happens after you got the girl?'<br/><br/>We are told upfront not to expect a happy ending, so we expect that watching closely we may learn to read the signs of a failing relationship. But when the movie arrives at the break-up we are left in shock - it comes out of nowhere! This is where the fun of (500) Days of Summer begins, and we start to shuffle around the 500 days, with the fresh perspective of Tom's little sister. We see unhappy sides to the relationship, we see the gap between Tom's idea of Summer and the real Summer, beautifully portrayed in a side-by-side view of Tom's expectations versus reality. And when reality doesn't satisfy his expectations, he gets angry at her!<br/><br/>And I feel this is the real lesson of the movie: Tom holds Summer responsible for failing to be what he expects her to be. All of us have assumptions about other people, what they are, what they like, etc., even in a loving relationship, call it an 'idea' of another person. This idea should be questioned and tested for gaps between idea and reality! But Tom forgoes his duty: ""Either she's an evil, emotionless, miserable human being, or... she's a robot. / She told you upfront she didn't want a relationship? / Well, yeah. / Jesus Tom... Did she break your heart or did you?""<br/><br/>Tom never loved Summer, only the idea of her, thereby devoid of all human intimacy! After watching the movie, we learn to read the sign of the failing relationship: his refusal to meet, see or get to know the real Summer. The relationship requires two persons, not a guy and an idea of a girl. The gap between expectation and reality opens up further and further until it cracks open, and Tom is left with empty hands, learning an obvious but easily forgotten lesson: when reality doesn't satisfy expectations, you should be angry at yourself for holding those expectations!<br/><br/>The movie is enjoyable, uses 'smart' tools to tell the story, and I think provides some real insight in human behaviour prohibiting true connections and true love."

","""this isn't a love story, but a story about love"", a quote from the ominous narrator which begins Webb refreshing take on the Rom-com genre, presenting a film that dosen't let itself be degraded by the popular clichés, but rather encapsulates the mythologies of the clichéd love story and rips it apart to present, most importantly, a refreshing, realistic and predominate tale of love.<br/><br/>The audience are introduced in hilarious fashion to tom, who is destroying plates from his breakup of his 'love' summer. Immediately you can tell that the film incorporates innovative techniques towards it's narrative structure, as the story is continuously told through the past, present and future shown through the time span of 500 hundred days.<br/><br/>Eventually we learn that tom met summer through her gaining a job at the same workplace, a card factory. Furthermore we learn that tom is quite good at his job which represent his thoughts on love being contributed from the concepts of pop-culture, for instance the ideas of faith and 'soul mates', while quite differently summer thoughts on love are based in a more realistic sense than rather influenced from clichéd ideas.<br/><br/>By using these characters to represent the different concepts of 'love', Webb creates a brilliant comparison between the realistic and idealistic view of 'love'. Webb captures this brilliantly, especially in one scene where tom is walking to summer's house party after they break up, hoping that this event will rejuvenate their love. While tom is walking to summer's the screen is split into two, reality and expectations. This juxtapositions is brilliant because Webb captures a moment shared among many, the hoping that the women you love will come back to you but eventually reality wins. These techniques used evoke the audacious of woody Allen narrative techniques.<br/><br/>There is also two brilliant uses of homages to the graduate and Ingmar Bergman, not just a gimmick but rather a another way of representing the characters emotions. tom and summer are at the theaters watching the graduate and by the ending summer begins to cry, as the ending of the graduate portrayed the characters accessing their values on their relationship and realizing if they truly loved each other, summer cries because she shares the same feelings. The other homage is to the great Ingmar Bergman, tom is at the theater after he has separated from summer, and three sequences from Bergman movies play, representing tom deep depressions.<br/><br/>The end of the movie was brilliant in capturing the essence of love, quite evident in tom and summer's final conversation highlighting the evasiveness of love and it's unpredictably motives.<br/><br/>Finally a movie the depicts love in a realistic process (and funny), despite how off-beat it may seem."
"colinrgeorge","6","3","4","6 April 2010"," ""(500) Days of Summer""
","The trailer for Marc Webb's ""500 Days of Summer"" goes out of its way to define itself as especially ""not a love story,"" which I guess is arguable by some gimmicky perspective technicality, and the film and its creators clearly imagine themselves pioneers in the romcom genre, but are deluding themselves if they don't admit to their playful plagiarism of half a dozen better films.<br/><br/>It's not that ""Summer"" is an entirely derivative work, but when a film is touted for its imagination, call me old-fashioned, but I'd like to see something new. The story and performances are satisfying, but its impossible to hear the staccato, high-brow, third-person narration without being reminded of Wes Anderson's ""Royal Tenenbaums,"" or ignore the similarities to Michel Gondry's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" in its non-linear examination of a crumbling relationship, or even watch the film's exuberant park dance sequence without being distracted by its striking resemblance to a number in Disney's ""Enchanted.""<br/><br/>The film relies on a few other pet peeve clichés, like a precocious eleven year old (Chloe Moretz) who coaches her grown-up brother, Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), through his rocky relationship with Summer (Zooey Deschanel), or the ending. There's unquestionably more emotional maturity on display in Webb's film than in most PG-13 Hollywood romantic comedies, but its final moments are pure formula. It's not that Tom and Summer are able to reconcile; they aren't. The trailer said as much. But the popular, ludicrously sentimental and instantly unnecessary rule in ending a romantic comedy in which the love interests don't reunite is that the protagonist needs to meet someone else by the film's end, almost always tacked onto the last five minutes. And as if that wasn't sappy enough, Tom's new girl is eye- rollingly named 'Autumn.' Come on, movie. You were talking about real people there for a minute.<br/><br/>But as I said, the film is halfway able to overcome its foundation of clichés mostly thanks to the stellar performances of its cast. Zooey Deschanel is adorable and completely believable as the sort of siren that would drive a guy like Tom out of his mind. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is charming and funny and never comes off as pathetic as the character easily could. The supporting cast, particularly Geoffrey Arend as Tom's buddy McKenzie, is spot on.<br/><br/>Still, ""Summer"" is atonal, perhaps from inception in its intention to create both visual metaphors for the sublimity of love and the unapologetic reality of loneliness, but the two worlds never cooperate for the artistic whole, effective as they may be apart. The occasional superfluous bit of narration, precedent-setting but decidedly uncommon fantasy sequences, textbook indie quirk, and non-sequential storytelling all ultimately distract from what would otherwise be considered an acceptable but utterly average love story. And let's face it. To suggest ""500 Days of Summer"" isn't a love story makes for a nice piece of sloganeering, but is as gimmicky and wafer-thin as the methods Webb employs to distinguish his film from the rest of the romcom crowd. It's a sweet, human piece of storytelling undone by its faux- ingenuity. Everything that distinguishes ""500 Days of Summer"" has been done better before, and while it's still worth a few healthy chuckles, the young filmmakers hardly make a name for themselves beyond copycats."

The layout of this movie, the camera shots, just so much is so different, but so good! There is one instant when you're watching two depictions of the same scene, the main role's expectations and the reality. So smart. In the beginning, the narrator says that this isn't a love story. In more ways than one, it truly isn't. However, in that one aspect it's a love story that everyone knows...that first love. Or that love you're hesitant about.

His portrayal of Tom is certainly within reason. Summer Fin's character is more complex and competently handled by Zooey Deschanel.

The message itself was actually not bad but the way it was handled was so banal it almost made me want to throw up midway through.<br/><br/>The plot itself is very messy and the narrative jumps are annoying as well as pointless. It would have functioned better as a linear story but that's not even the worst part of the film. The worst part is the fact that the film has no sense of direction in the sense that it does not know what it wants to be. It somehow hits all the clichés of a romance and yet it tries to be a deep movie which is where the problem is. If it stuck to being a romance then it would be tolerable but I think the issue is that it is a romance but it pretends to not be one which is not something that can be done, especially since it hits all the characteristics of a romance.<br/><br/>The humour falls very flat and there's pretty much no aspect of this which I found funny. At best this is a sort of failed mish mash of ideas wrapped up in pretentiousness in the hopes that the message of the film will distract the audience from how bland and banal the movie is and to be fair, it did work for the vast majority of the people.<br/><br/>It's actually a shame about the execution because the premise of the film is good. When watching a movie, there's a shared idea that we'd suspend disbelief in return for a good story and or engaging characters etc, this movie took those expectations and stamped on them.

To make a whole movie about it, is like watching somebody having constipation for one hour and a half: we know it happens frequently but it's not really what we want to go to the movies for.

Guaranteed you won't even crack a smile.<br/><br/>It goes from one banal situation to the next, all building up to a simple, easily understood conclusion -- he is smitten, she is not...bye bye boy. We should not have been tortured for what seemed like hours to get to this uncomplicated, uninteresting denouement. Everything in between is schlock and cloyingly creepy. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levit, an actor with some incredible chops, does his best to keep this thing from descending into pretentious stupidity, but in spite of his heroic efforts, he is unsuccessful. He handles the maudlin dialog as best he can, while his love interest seems to just wander thru her lines, totally unable to make you believe ANYONE would actually speak this inane dialogue. For all the effort of the cast (Levit much more so than Dechanel) to pull off dialogue that is so off-center, in the end, the sitcom-about-to-be-canceled quality of the thing becomes almost painful to watch. The only thing missing is the canned laugh track, while the director uses silly tech tricks in an attempt to make the mess seem ""profound,"" like using spit screens with the word EXPECTATION on one screen and REALITY on the other and like adding intrusive narration that simply pops in with no apparent reason and in a voice that has a weird accent and timber which resembles one of those gravely trailer voice-over voices. There is even sequence where all of a sudden we are in a MARY POPPINS movie with the live characters actually breaking into choreographed dance, replete with a Disney-esque animated bird interacting with JG-L. The cumulative effect of all this is a disjointed, meandering, pretentious mess signifying nothing. <br/><br/>Bottom line...even if you find this title on Neflix for free, don't waste your time. If your girlfriend or significant other insists she wants to watch it (she might, it's been hailed as a ""chick flick""), be sure you get a firm commitment to get something YOU want in return before you waste what I guarantee will feel like 3 hours of sloppy trash to you."

","I think love stories are underrated due to the fact that it's pretty predictable how they end up. The guy getting the girl at the end because it's their fate.<br/><br/>That doesn't happen with this one. At all. In fact, the viewer spends so much time around this girl the main character's such a fan for and then he doesn't get her. And that is easily understood by the title itself and it'd seem sad after so much plot development. But that is key!<br/><br/>The first time I watched this I didn't like it at all. They should have ended up together because that was just how it should have been. They liked the same songs, laughed at the same little things and were pretty happy portraying a recently-married couple in IKEA.<br/><br/>But I was also 13 back then and only now, watching it again, did I really get it. Because it does teach a valuable lesson. One that destiny is what we make of it, that we may countdown our lives and close our eyes and chose to ignore anything but that person we've chosen to love because we are so hooked to them, but that that is a product of our (mis)conception that it is made to be when it might not. And only when we leave that behind and accept it and change things for the better do we, by accident, find happiness where we least expect it. And that's what makes this such a memorable movie.<br/><br/>Aside from the aforementioned, it has great soundtrack - thumbs up! -, wonderful acting, smooth editing and, above all, a mesmerizing plot. I just wish it wouldn't have been just one-and-a-half-hour long but I guess that's just the way it is."
"tedg","Null","4","6","21 August 2010"," Death by Numbers
","Boy, how frustrating it is to have a movie that is nearly perfect in some respects but broken in others, especially when it has the potential to do things.<br/><br/>This has the potential because it is a love story that bends the expectations from movie romance more toward the ebbs and flows of real life. In breaking this habit of expectations it uses a clever device: it breaks the linear narrative, giving you a numeric timescale. This is handled effectively because the film establishes a space for us outside the flow, populated by us and a narrator when we shift times.<br/><br/>There is another device, used less expertly: architecture. The setup is that our guy is not a whole man romantically because he is trapped in a traditional romantic comedy sort of world. He literally works for a metaphorically apt greeting card company, generating fantasy. This is as opposed to the more three dimensional world he sees and appreciates but has yet to commit to. We are reminded of this whenever we enter that neutral narrator's space because the timeline is a number over an ""architectural drawing"" by his more mature self.<br/><br/>It should have worked. It surely was well enough considered and has a first class place in the film. But the problem is that the filmmaker did not understand architectural dynamics well enough to use them. What he thinks is architecture is the grouping of buildings you see when sitting on a park bench and mapping the three dimensional experience to a two dimensional drawing. This is as great a mistake as being in the greeting card business and sort of poisons the dynamic that this is supposed to support.<br/><br/>But I count it a plus that they knew about the dynamic and tried even though they didn't actually capture it.<br/><br/>The thing that doesn't work in my opinion is the girl. I've just seen another film, much more ambitious that Zooey anchored. She mastered the thing with a practiced stance at being outside the reaction of self without being within a state of self knowledge. Here, she is supposed to be ubercute but secure in action, something not normal in film woman. But she cannot pull it off: either she is earnest or she is submissively appealing, or she is in control of her life but never all three at once. And this is what we need.<br/><br/>In fact, in the midst of our hero's depression, he has a blind date with an attractive redhead played by Rachel Boston. (Why are so many secondary redhead actresses named Rachel?) She is better at this synthesis than Zooey, but perhaps that was deliberate.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

To my older eyes, it seemed a bit of fluff, a forgettable reverie, some bittersweet moments on the way to growing up. The episodic movie is broken into individual ""days,"" with each scene lasting only a minute or two; it soon became clear there wouldn't be time to develop deep feelings and each vignette felt cursory and sometimes even corny.

"Michael-70","10","9","18","31 March 2009"," A Delightful ROM/COM! Joseph Gordon-Levitt Just Gets Better With Each Film!
","This is a thoroughly delightful romantic comedy that is actually romantic and above all funny. Joseph Gordon Levitt is just getting better with each passing year. If this film does not mark some kind of breakout for him, than I don't know what is wrong with people.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt plays Thomas, a writer for a greeting card company based in LA. He has been a romantic since high school when he compulsively watched The Graduate and listened to British bands like The Smiths and Joy Division. A narrator informs us that Thomas believes in finding that one true love.<br/><br/>His true love turns out to be Summer played by Zooey Deschanel. She comes to work at the greeting card company as an office assistant and they both fall into a somewhat passionate affair, at least from Thomas's perspective. Summer however, is a bit more cautious.<br/><br/>Overlay this with a hip, retro score of old tunes and pop-cultural references and you could have something deplorable, but what can I say, this film is genius. We are immediately informed by the God-like narrator and the particularly hilarious disclaimer that this is a film that will not be afraid of using filmic technique.<br/><br/>The title refers to the 500 days of Thomas's relationship with Summer and we are constantly shifting back and forth from different days of their love affair albeit with a helpful numeric counter title card. Some may find it disconcerting to go from say Day 4 to Day 309 and then to Day 83, but this is actually a quite effective structure for this story and the contrasts between the beginning of the affair from the end of the affair are sometimes hilarious, sometimes quite moving and sometimes realistically painful as only those who have been in an intense relationship can understand.<br/><br/>The creative thinking throughout this movie is phenomenal, for example, to display different states of a characters mind, we see everything from a parody of a French New Wave film with Gordon-Levitt doing his best Jean Paul Belmondo, to a spoof of the chess scene on the beach from Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal.<br/><br/>At one point, we break into an extremely lively and hilarious musical number full of marching bands and a little animated bluebird tweeting precociously. At another point, we are thrust out of the story and directly into the offices of a record company where business executives try to figure out why there was a huge spike in sales of the Belle And Sebastian CD The Boy With The Arab Strap in northern Michigan. Trust me, in context, it is quite funny.<br/><br/>If this film has a spiritual father, that has to be the 1977 Oscar winning film Annie Hall from director Woody Allen. Like that film, this one is about a writer of sorts and it follows the ups and downs of a relationship with a woman who starts out sort of weak, but develops personal strength as she goes along.<br/><br/>There is a scene in this film that is a split screen in which Thomas goes to a party at Summer's apartment and we see on the left side of the screen Thomas's expectations of how that evening would go and on the right we see the reality. This is a brilliant touch to show the confusion between a characters hopes and their real lives and was reminiscent of the scene in Annie Hall where Woody Allen and Diane Keaton first meet and while they are making banal conversation we see their inner thoughts via subtitles.<br/><br/>The director of this film seems to have come from the world of music videos and the screenwriters seem to have only one other produced credit, The Pink Panther 2. I had no desire to see that film before, but now I will.<br/><br/>But it is Joseph Gordon-Levitt who deserves a lot of praise. He has played very serious parts in the past, from the gay hustler in Mysterious Skin, the brain damaged ex-jock in The Lookout, he was the suicidal marine in Stop/Loss and the hard talking hero of that great High School noir film Brick.<br/><br/>But he cuts loose here and he's dynamite. Sexy, intelligent, sometimes brooding and just a little bit arrogant, if I have had any complaint about Gordon-Levitt in the past, it's been that by taking such diverse roles, it looked more like he was trying to show-off his range, but here, he's a total charmer and nothing is harder to do on screen.<br/><br/>While it probably won't happen, this is just the kind of small, pleasant film that should get a whole bunch of Oscar nominations. Too bad I'm not a voting member of the Academy or this film would be a clean sweep."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","6","11","14 August 2009"," A few complaints...
","-the tonality is a bit awkward. The comedy, even the 'highbrow' stuff, is really, really silly, and while that's not a problem at all, that the next scene is supposed to have a strong dramatic impact on the audience comes across as jarring and not in a good way because the transition is so clumsily handled much of the time.<br/><br/>-the movie thinks it has more gravity than it does. The Henry Miller quote (""the best way to get over a woman is to turn her into literature"") explains this to me. Clearly that's what the screenwriters have done with their past relationships, but as a result, as I suspect such an attempt by most writers including myself would, the movie attaches a little too much gravity to what is really another office-born half-romance. The movie treats the subject matter with a sense of irony and there are scenes which plainly show the reality of the matter, but I really found it hard to care that much when watching it again. They never seemed all that compatible. They had just met and had some fun times. Tom got too attached. Why Tom's obsession should make for earth-shattering drama I don't understand. I couldn't help but think about the relationship I'm in and think how trivial this 500 days of events seemed next to the years invested mutually in a friendship then romance, the incredibly tumultuous events we've weathered together. Then I think back to ""Annie Hall"" and recognize that relative to my experience, that relationship can be seen as trivial as well. That I can, for the length of ""Annie Hall"", feel like that relationship is the summation of humanity's history of existence, says something about the quality of execution in that movie relative to this. The awkward dramatics (I RLY HOPE U R HAPPY SUMMAR, and the godawful Big Speech about how bad greeting cards are, wow, writers, feel good about writing what millions of bitter anti-mainstream sorts are talking about at this very moment... I've never heard that before!) and cheesy narration don't really help much at all, and betray at times the superb performances from basically all the actors in the film, but especially Gordon-Levitt. Even ""Adventureland"" from earlier this year, with its summer fling at an amusement park, feels more important somehow than this portrayal of half a billion corporate office 'romances' going on right now, maybe because it's predicated on the smoldering sexual energy of the leads instead of attempting to deal (and clumsily) with stuff like fate and true love and that.<br/><br/>-the characters really, really are lacking in depth. Summer can be read as an interesting subversion of the manic pixie dream girl character, but Tom is a cultured version of a sitcom character and everyone else in the movie a caricature. The screenwriters appear to be cultured themselves, but only manage to loan this characteristic to their characters on a temporary basis, turning them right back into regular, plain, dull corporate annoyances who shop at IKEA (but go to cool-looking record stores and to see The Graduate!) in a matter of seconds. They're all too reminiscent of people I meet every day with the pretense of cultural interest and all the snobbery attached to it (including instant dismissal of sports culture, to my great annoyance), but very little actual knowledge of anything beyond the absolute mainstream of the underground (Smiths and Bergman references galore, but try talking to them about The Trash Can Sinatras or Jacques Rivette).<br/><br/>-that final scene. Oh god, that final scene. Oh god, that final scene.<br/><br/>All that said, I still liked it, just because it's a tremendous, very quotable comedy and genuinely clever at times, unlike Juno and such, and has some great movie scenes like the split-screen one and the musical montage and what follows, the art movie/Bergman parody/homage etc. etc. The comedy's great, too bad the drama's so clumsy."

","Remember when independent films were really independent? 500 Days Of Summer is so dull and Sundance friendly that I felt angry leaving the theater. What really made me nuts was reading after that the creators of the film actually thought they were making some kind of radical romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Nothing in this entire movie is original, intelligent, or subversive. Most of it was stolen from Woody Allen. And a movie that is angry at women and doesn't understand women fits in really well with all the Apatow comedies coming out. So who is kidding who?<br/><br/>Super-stylized, super cold, this movie is great for shallow young people who don't have a clue.<br/><br/>Myself, being over 50, if I want to watch great pop movies I'll go watch ""A Hard Day's Night"" or ""Shoot The Piano Player.""

","A lot of people have commented that this movie is fresh, charming, delightful... well I don't see much of those characteristics. It's a typical independent movie with independent music playing over practically every other scene. It features the voice over, the quirky characters, character confessionals, little antique animations, not so insightful viewpoints, and the story is pretty dry. Boy meets girl, girl doesn't want a relationship. Boy pursues anyway. The cast, however, makes most of it work. The two leads do maintain some kind of chemistry, but it's told to us from the very beginning that this is not a love story, so there's no reason to get caught up in their romance. Another facet that the film is missing is that it never shows their relationship in full bloom. We only see the beginning and the end, for the most part. Why does the male lead long for Summer after they break up? That's not really established. He's basically in love with being in love. Summer is more cautious (aka mature) than that. Basically, it relies on melodrama (music set to action) to elicit some kind of emotional response, and a lot of it is repetitive. As far as charming or delightful go, this is a break up movie. It's depressing more than anything. But if you like what the clichés that have filled independent cinema, this movie should satisfy.<br/><br/>P.S. Also, beware of massive product placement in this one. You'd think Akia sponsored the movie with how many times their logo is dropped."

"Turfseer","5","3","5","5 February 2010"," Mediocre Romantic Comedy cannot be saved by quirky fantasy sequences
","500 Days of Summer attempts to dissect the rise and fall of a relationship between two young people who work together at a greeting card company. For most of the film, we're constantly shifting around at different points in time in the couples' relationship (the number of days that have passed in the relationship constantly appear to remind the viewer at which point in time we're looking at).<br/><br/>The protagonist is Tom Hansen, played by the likable and handsome Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He meets Summer Finn (the quintessential Indie actor, Zooey Deschanel), a mercurial waif of sorts, who only wants to have a 'casual' relationship. Not only does Tom put Summer on a pedestal but the screenwriters do as well—we find out next to nothing about her except for the fact that she believes that Ringo was the greatest Beatle and she's willing to pattern some of her behavior in the bedroom based on a porno tape the couple has rented.<br/><br/>In short, Tom is guilty of puppy dog love—and it's the examination of his obsession that we're forced to watch for about an hour and a half. One wonders what Tom sees in Summer but that doesn't really concern the film's scenarists. We're treated to a series of gimmicky 'fantasy' sequences that chronicle Tom's mood changes as his relationship with Summer begins to deteriorate.<br/><br/>In the beginning, after he makes love to Summer for the first time, he's out on the streets, leading a huge crowd of people in song and dance, accompanied by a marching band. Then there are nods to the great film directors such as Fellini (Summer and Tom are now characters in their own version of 'La Dolce Vita') and Bergman (Tom becomes the brooding Knight in a takeoff on the famous playing chess with Death scene). As things get bad, a split screen displays Tom's expectations and 'reality', when the feuding lovebirds attend a party together. Finally, at his darkest moment, Tom morphs into a fading pencil drawn figure against an animated background.<br/><br/>'Summer' aims at some comic relief as the Greeting Card company that Tom and Summer work at are populated with quirky characters who always are trying to come up with new pithy sayings for the wacky greeting cards they're attempting to compose. Also in the mix are Tom's two best friends who appear to have less than stellar love lives. Perhaps the least humorous of the comic relief is Tom's younger sister, who occasionally pops up and offers obnoxious advice about dating etiquette.<br/><br/>Tom eventually overcomes his depression over losing Summer by quitting his job at the greeting card company and going on job interviews at architectural firms, where he seeks to pursue his life-long job working at a 'legitimate' job as an architect. As for Summer, Tom is confused by her sudden decision not to pursue 'casual' relationships anymore, and get married.<br/><br/>'500 Days' has a very nice look to it and its witty pop culture reference will keep your interest. But in the end, it has little to offer in terms of appealing to the intellect. Do we really care about Summer, a cipher of a character who's put on a pedestal ? And what's so captivating about Tom's obsession and decline into depression? If you're looking for escapist entertainment to pass some time, '500 Days' fits the bill. But ultimately, I doubt that this film will be remembered in the coming years as a romantic comedy classic, or even remembered at all."

","I think there are some good things about this movie unfortunately the aspect I was most interested in seeing was the most disappointing part of it. This movie would have been more successful to me if it didn't contain all the ""indie"" clichés and by clichés, they are seriously clichés. A Date to Ikea? (Hello Pavement song, and just sort of a hipsteresque concept, I guess.. they're Swedish meatballs are great and their furniture is angular and cheap).. nowadays Ikea could have been Target as well. Singing the Pixies at a karaoke bar?  yup! Smiths obsession? Check! All of these things can seem sort of dated to some and not very universal to many others. However, it's so deliberately geared towards hipsters it should have taken place in Portland! The story concept I kind of liked many of us know the frustration of being in love with someone in a ""Friends with Benefits"" type situation and I had never seen that portrayed so well in a film. Also the sequencing of the movie itself was pretty cool, however I just wish they'd played down the indie cred stuff. It was way too over the top and cliché. The dancing scene, however, is hilarious because it's so cliché and I get that! And very out of place since that's the only scene in the entire movie that has an ounce of camp to it. It's waaaaay better than Flakes, but that's not saying much. I really want to like Zoey Daschnel but it seems to me she always finds herself in movies that play up the whole indie thing to the point cheeseyness, but not cheesy enough to be funny."
"secondtake","7","3","5","23 October 2009"," More about editing cleverness than real deep feeling, but very fun anyway, and tender.
","500 Days of Summer (2009)<br/><br/>OK. First--I liked this movie. I seem to emphasize reasons why it wasn't terrific below, but it's good to remember I liked it. And didn't love it.<br/><br/>Maybe the clever beginning, insisting through a deep-voiced narrator with a twitch of humor, raises expectations a little: this is not a love story. But it looks and feels like one, and of course, it is one, whatever the end might imply. Love varies and is still love.<br/><br/>The movie leans on its format, jumping from moment to moment back and forth through the year and a half of the movie, to give it some of its verve. Surprises are often created by a wry coupling of moments--a happy person as the elevator doors close turns to a sad person when they open, a couple hundred days later. And then back, to day 3 or day 40, or whatever gap might be mined for laughs and irony. This saves the movie, really, but it also becomes the movie, instead of the relationship between the two young leads. The relationship should be everything, and it is everything, of course, but it isn't really much. If you put the pieces back in chronological order, you have something not too amazing, something actually pretty dull, certainly not an hour and half's worth.<br/><br/>The man, Tom, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the woman, Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel, are almost perfect. They're fun, they are witty, they are restrained as needed, they show tenderness. I liked them a lot, but I didn't love them, and neither did the person I saw the movie with. And if there is a film that needs a couple with magic on the screen, true chemistry, this is it. But then, of course, the ending might make sense in this light. But then, further, if the whole point is a movie about a romance that doesn't quite get off the ground, it keeps the movie grounded, too. I prefer a movie that takes off somehow.<br/><br/>Except for some movie oddities, the events are told simply, and out of order. There is the dancing in the park (completely out of character, but I liked it because it was a breath of air, fresh or not, just air), and some split screen comparisons (sometimes just a way of layering the plot, sometimes to create plot, by creating a fantasy on one side and reality on the other). And these are good, even if they remind you that a lot of the rest is just plain vanilla. <br/><br/>In all, the movie is fun, for sure, a joy even, and without glaring issues. Certain clichés are avoided--the woman is strong and smart, the man gentle and un-macho. They actually make a nice couple. But maybe slightly less interesting than some of your friends, who they don't make movies about for the simple reason they aren't interesting enough."
"Likes_Ninjas90","6","3","5","5 October 2009"," Given its non-linear structure, it is surprising how simple the majority of the film is in its representation of a failed relationship
","A young man named Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who designs greeting cards falls in love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel) a new woman working in his office. Their relationship, including the breakup, is told in a non-linear fashion with a counter appearing on screen to show what particular days in their relationship we are viewing. At first Summer seems to only want to be friends but then still quickly changes her mind commences a relationship with Tom. They regularly toy with question of whether they are friends or whether they are actually a couple. Gradually, we see the way in which their relationship has worn down Tom and contributed to his bitterness, his attempt to win her back and his eventual realisation on love.<br/><br/>This offbeat comedy, released by Fox Searchlight Pictures, the same distributor as Juno, echoes Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in the way that it plays with structure in showing the breakdown of a relationship. This is the first film of Marc Webb, who previously worked with music videos. Through its voice over, alternative soundtrack and visual flair like split screens and sketch drawings, the film is high self-conscious about itself as a 'post-Juno' indie film, while also mimicking the likes of Garden State too. Rather than grounding the film entirely in a sense of realism like Juno though, the film jarringly tries to combine a realistic depiction of a relationship with more exaggerated moments. A prologue detailing how Summer's presence alone was able to raise the revenue of an ice-cream parlour, or a conversation in the bed of an IKEA store about how Summer is not looking for an entirely serious relationship, seem particularly unfitting. With a greater sense of restraint and deeper insights, this would have been a more emotionally rewarding film.<br/><br/>Given its non-linear structure, it is surprising how simple the majority of the film is in its representation of a failed relationship. Two of the most visually elaborate moments of the picture highlight this simplicity. After Tom sleeps with Summer, he awakes the next morning full of swagger and begins dancing with people in the street, as an animated bird and a marching band appear on screen. Though funny, this sequence is never used as a platform to extend upon what the relationship is providing for Tom beyond the current happiness we are seeing. Late in the film when Tom has split with Summer, he still attends her party and the film divides itself into a split screen showing how the party briefly plays out on both what he expected to happen and what the reality is. Though again this is a visually clever idea, it plays to the most basic of emotions on screen, adding little depth or discussion to the failure of the relationship itself. Similarly, sex throughout the film is either highly trivialised or shied away from entirely. Although in one scene Tom and Summer watch a pornographic film together and then try to mimic the same shower sex, there is little attempt to examine tougher issues, like the way that sex is used to sustain even the most unlikely relationships. Only by the end of the film do the most intellectual points, like a discussion of whether relationships come from fate or are coincidental, begin to surface.<br/><br/>Despite a certainly air of smugness about much of the film's humour, the occasional echo of real life is actually very funny to see on screen: a moment where Tom and his friends examine the exact words that Summer said to greet him and then conclude that if she said hey then she is a lesbian, is a real gem. The film is most truthful in moments like these and had it focused more on how pedantic people are in examining relationships it may have been even funnier. A great deal of the humour is also derived from the non-linear structure of the film, showing the conflict of emotions for Levitt's character as he moves in and out of his relationship. In one sequence he happily walks into the lift at his office but quickly the film fast forwards with the on screen day counter and Tom comes out of the same lift looking like a complete mess. Levitt is very good in having to move between such a variety of emotions. Yet given the film is dominated by Tom's perspective, it is unfortunate that Summer herself becomes a less interesting character. Though early on we learn that her parents' divorce left her not wanting a relationship and that she sporadically moves from being interested and thoroughly uninterested in Tom, her character feels quite hollow with little attempt to examine who she really is and why she is so unsure. She is a rather beautiful but less interesting figure of the film.<br/><br/>Although one can appreciate (500) Days of Summer for attempting something different with the romantic comedy genre, this is still a rather disappointing and shallow film. Despite its elaborate structure, the film seems to have a very minimal number of new and interesting insights into the failures of a modern day relationship, beyond the see-saw of emotions that it produces for someone. The film has a number of surprising visual tricks, but if the same creativity had been placed into the screenplay it would have made for a much more memorable film. There are still laughs to be found though and Levitt remains a standout, just don't expect any long-term fulfilment."

","500 Days Of Summer is a new comedy drama that examines and probes deep into your normal average romantic films and gives us it's own look at relationships and why they do sometimes work and why sometimes they don't. Just briefly it is about a young man named Tom, who falls for his new co-worker Summer and while they begin to bond and become good friends, he wants a much more committed relationship, whereas she wants it to be casual and sometimes seems to be giving Tom the brush off, so to speak. With the help of his friends and little sister, Tom tries to put all the pieces together to win Summer over, but along the way he does discover a lot more about himself, her and how tricky relationships can be. 500 Days Of Summer is not your typical film about love and I am hoping that that fact will not put too many viewers off. If you were hoping to see a predictably happy and schmaltzy head over heels in love film, then you should probably check for a different film to see, or if you are a little more experimental than give this one a try. By the end of the film it reminded me a lot of some of my favourite Woody Allen relationship comedy dramas of the 70's like Annie Hall and Manhattan. They both offer up some of the most witty, human and realistic looks at love and relationships I have ever seen and both sets of films do so in a quirky and sometimes offbeat kind of way and also blends comedy into the mix to make things interesting. Even the character personalities of Tom and Summer reminded me of a lot of the male and female leads in those Woody Allen pictures as well. A lot of the times because of how real and believable they seemed and because they were actually smart and well spoken characters who knew what they were talking about and what they wanted. They can get a bit high strung and over analyze things at times, but I also enjoyed that perspective of the film as well because honestly speaking, which of us does not do that at all in any sort of a difficult situation? I also really liked Tom and Summer because while watching the film I felt like I got to know them better and it were like watching everyday average people and even with their quirks and sometimes stubbornness that at times drove them throughout the film, I still really liked these characters, flaws and all. Not to mention that Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel who play these characters do a fantastic job. I also must mention the low key yet interesting direction of the film's director and the brilliant dialogue and look at human nature and relationships that felt like the most honest film about said subject I have seen in awhile. All this may sound like a heavier and more depressing film, but it is anything but. At times it was very cheerful and always left the door for the characters open to new possibilities and outcomes. Some of the humour in the film works quite well also, so it is not a depressing experience at all. I think if anything the film will offer couples who go to see it a lot to talk about. Not necessarily concerning ruining their relationships, but perhaps in some ways to make it better and discuss things about it that they normally might not have. For it's depth, insight and charm 500 Days Of Summer is a definite winner and one of the best films of the year."
"Hint523","10","4","8","11 August 2009"," 500 Days of Summer Movie Review
","I got to see this film for free, in an advance screening and the Denver premiere (because of my membership in the LTFC and DFC). It was a full theater, and I almost didn't make it in, because only the first 120 people got in. To top off a full theater, the air conditioning was broken, so my sunburned back worked up quite a sweat, but that's already more than you need to know.<br/><br/>The tag line says, ""This is not a love story, this is a story about love"", which couldn't be truer. For all of the lame romantic comedies (rom-coms) that believe they have something fresh to offer, I have yet to see one that does, until now. This is for a number of reasons, but most obviously, this is about the man, not the woman. And this is an ordinary guy, not some Hollywood hunk. They're also all very formulaic, and from the very opening scene of the film, in which we learn that our two leads are in a sticky situation, we know that this isn't the case. ""Summer"" offers everything with a fresh and very indie plate, but one that tastes good as well.<br/><br/>The story follows Tom (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) who is a greeting card writer, and a talented one at that. One day his boss gets a new assistant, Summer (Zooey Deschanel) who is sort of the typical indie girl (the only generic part of this film). We learn about their relationship in a mixed fashion, we scan through the titular 500 days in a jumbled order, started with 250- something and moving to 1, then going back to 260-something. For the first 30-odd days Tom is too nervous to talk to her, other than small talk in elevators and such, but his crush on her is ever-present to the audience. Finally they meet, and when they do it's movie magic, despite that we already know that something major goes wrong. Now that description does no justice to the brilliance of the story. I can't describe it without revealing much, but it's a carefully woven story pattern that is top-notch, and just as important, feels more realistic than any other rom-com I've ever seen. I could relate to Tom so much on his struggles with his woman, and that coming from a kid it extraordinary. I imagine it will click even better to the lonely 20-something men out there, who I'll join before I know it. Mind you, realistic is different than plausible, but that's a topic for a different post.<br/><br/>Did I mention that this film is hilarious? Not rom-com funny, laugh out loud hilarious. And that's another element that's missing from these romance flicks. Realistic problems and confrontations are much funnier than the silly slapstick ones in the long haul.<br/><br/>Marc Webb's direction feels like a good indie music video, and that makes sense seeing that's all he's done before this. He alludes to his background with a very funny dance number that puts most movie musicals to shame. The editing is also fantastic, and some of the best I've seen on this type of work (comparing it to Thelma and Bourne isn't fair). And the actors are fantastic, and let's pray for some Golden Globe nominations for Zooey and Joe. But of all the elements, the screenplay deserves the most praise. Creating a realistic, funny, romantic, enjoyable, feel-good, and out of order story is incredibly hard to do. I will remember this film on my roster in the Best Original Screenplay category, even if it gets out shined everywhere else.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fantastic, funny, and memorable film, and it puts all other romantic comedies, indie romances, and feel good-flicks to shame. Don't let the mediocre trailer deceive you – this film is a 10/10"
"griffolyon12","10","4","8","10 August 2009"," All in 500 Days!
","500 days. Doesn't sound like a very long period of time, but when given the right circumstances those days slowly creep by. A lot can happen in just a mere 500 days, one can find love, lose it, and then discover their true happiness and have their beliefs completely reaffirmed. That is the film (500) Days of Summer in a nutshell.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is the story of Tom, a greeting card writer, and his romantic relationship with Summer, his boss's assistant. The story follows the ups-and-downs of their relationship over the course of 500 days. Tom, a hopeless romantic, hopes to find true love around every turn, while Summer doesn't want a serious relationship.<br/><br/>The film unfolds in a nonlinear fashion, beginning at the end, then skipping to the middle, and then back to the beginning again. At first it catches one by surprise, throwing all anyone has ever known about story structure out the door, but after the midpoint of the film these transitions simply feel natural in order to tell the story the way it was meant to be told. Director Marc Webb infuses the film with a very pleasing visual style, giving the film this dream-like feel. As well the acting from the two leads, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel is fantastic, in particular Gordon Levitt. Gordon Levitt's performance as Tom is deeply affecting. He is funny while also being the everyman. Gordon Levitt at times reminds one of a young Tom Hanks or Jimmy Stewart, and I feel with the right role he can become a mega star.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is a film that feels as if it is a modern day fairy tale, while also being highly realistic at the same time. The dream-like look of the film and the hilarity that ensues in many situations is not always channeling realism (not to mention the omniscient narrator who comes in from time-to-time), but what makes this film feel real is the emotions of the characters and their relationships. I think every guy can relate to Tom and his pursuit of true love. Every guy has known a girl like Summer, a girl that they wanted but could never truly have. It is because of this I believe that this is not your typical romantic comedy. It's actually a romantic comedy told for men rather than women, and it's from this viewpoint that I managed to identify with Tom so much. Of course what this film offers most importantly is hope, letting us realize that there truly are other fish in the sea.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is a highly entertaining film. It is funny, charming, and hopeful all in one. While this film will ultimately not appeal to all, it is definitely worth a look.<br/><br/>I give (500) Days of a Summer a 10 out of 10!"
"Quinoa1984","9","4","8","3 August 2009"," imperfect, but it's more alive than 500+ romantic comedies
","Too often in American movies with romance and comedy, sometimes not in that order and sometimes (if not enough at all) take the romance and personal consequences of a relationship seriously, we're made to feel as an audience by the BS of Hollywood formulas that we should like the characters even when they're wrong or stupid or, on more than one occasion, sociopaths. The pleasure of (500) Days of Summer is that it doesn't tell us how to think or feel about this couple, Tom and Summer. Indeed it would be quite unfair to make us just automatically like a guy who has had the 'first-love-forever' notion since childhood and the girl being one without any real solid core of emotions that one can really connect to. It's much to complex, and by the end we simply understand the both of them, which is all that a movie about two people in a relationship- well, let's not ""label"" it, I guess- should try to accomplish.<br/><br/>But more than that, (500) Days of Summer is one of those rare contemporary movies that taps into the ups and downs of a heart-breaker. One could compare it to that other masterful/somber ""hipster"" opus (must use quotes since I can't verify it for sure) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. While the latter had a genius at the helm in Michel Gondry, the director here, Marc Webb, is not one to scoff at, either, at least as a real formidable creative talent whom I can't wait to see more of. He and his co-writer develop this story of Tom and Summer in a manner that one can see the whole 'what-went-wrong' thing in their relationship. But it's pretty clear, actually, from the start: Tom is very interested, probably more than just as a friend, while Summer says 'let's not label things' and just be friends. This is code, to be sure, but Tom doesn't read it, and why should he? It is, at least for him, walking on sunshine with Summer... at least, for the first couple hundred days or so.<br/><br/>It's imaginative storytelling and solid character development. These are the bedrocks that make this film so impressive. All one can ask for are two characters who can engage us, in every moment that one would want for a three-dimensional picture. It's been argued already that since the film is mostly (save for a couple of third-person narrator bits) from Tom's point of view, we don't really get to know Summer on the same level. This isn't really true, it's just that they're different people to tap into, but also have been established at the start of the film like comic-book characters with their powers: Tom watched the Graduate as a kid and got the wrong idea by the ending, while Summer kept cutting her hair and wondering why it didn't hurt. One is love-sick and twisted by the promise of fate, and the other is pleasant and fun on the shallow surface and underneath is cold and bottled up and without much one can see of anything of a real connection (a key scene is when Tom and Summer go to see the Graduate together, and Summer sobs at the end with Benjamin and Elaine on the bus- ponder over it when the movie ends).<br/><br/>But, aside from all of those ponderous and inquisitive beats about the nature of connectedness with people, of liking or loving or just realizing what one does with their lives as meaningless or with meaning, it's a superbly entertaining piece of pop excitement. It's not a full-on laugh out loud affair, but it doesn't need to be. We already have the characters, and their non-linear track of things as they come, and the filmmakers go for an approach to heighten whatever moods are on display. Take the truly awesome and hilarious 'musical' number with Tom dancing in the street with a whole squad behind him to Hall & Oates. Or, on a more personal-taste level (my favorite scene in the movie as a comedy), when Tom goes to the movie on his own and sees the French New Wave scene merge into the parodies of Persona and Seventh Seal.<br/><br/>And, on top of this, the style, which could be dubbed as 'quirky' by those who can't find a better word like 'inventive' or 'smart' or forbid 'wonderful', is Webb's attentiveness to the style as reflects a scene with the camera and editing. This goes beyond just some cheeky-clever student film thing. When we see, for example, when Tom goes to the party that (ex) Summer invites Tom to, very unfairly indeed, and we see the split-screen of the Fantasy and the Reality of the scene, with a movement of the camera to fill the whole frame when the reveal in Reality comes crashing down for Tom (it's a twist that isn't a big spoiler since it's at the start of the film), it's not one of those gimmicks unearned. (500) Days of Summer is a fresh blast that is thoughtful and endearing, and never for a second spoon-feeds the audience. It doesn't give us characters to always like, but its honesty makes us feel for them (even Summer) more than any other rom-com this season. Autumn, on the other hand..."

A truly wonderfully executed rom/dramedy that has echoes of John Hughes/Cameron Crowe romanticism/whimsy about boy-meets-girl (the amazingly subtle Gordon-Levitt and the deliciously delightful Deschanel, channeling John Cusack from ""SAY ANYTHING"" and Ally Sheedy from ""THE BREAKFAST CLUB"" as archetypes of the nice-guy/off-center muse) in sunny LA (never looking better thanks to fantastic camera-work by Eric Steelberg), comes off executed as a mix-tape to the heart in how falling in love can be remarkably schizophrenic/inspring/crazingly difficult/intoxicating/infuriating/admirable/shocking/familiar and practically universal in how one goes from one extreme to the other in attempting to figure out soulmate status or casual sex with leaps and bounds of highly imaginative screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. Marc Webb makes a fantastic directorial debut allowing his main characters free-range in displaying their chops as well as showcasing their personas. A superb soundtrack also helps, namely the charming use of Hall & Oates' ""You Make My Dreams Come True"" and the ethereally poignant ""Bookends"" by Simon & Garfunkel.

"ctg0724","10","4","8","22 July 2009"," this movie knew how to win over any other recent romance film
","Why was this movie so terrific? Aside from the fact that it was incredibly sincere in its realism while at the same time being very stylistic, it was great for its relevance to romantic experiences.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is such a talent to be cherished? Why is this guy so much more on my respect level than all these other young actors working in Hollywood. Not only does Gordon- Levitt pick movies that have more emphasis in being a good story than being heavily promoted, he is willing to play characters that don't necessarily make himself look like a superstar. He is brave enough to play a part in which he would have to be very insecure in front of massive audiences. For that I commend him.<br/><br/>(500) Days is so successful in humor, replicating real emotions and situations and making people (me at least) recall memories of our own. It has countless parts I cannot stop thinking about and laughing over. It is really wonderful. An unexpected film in a summer filled with high budget action films that can't quite get universal praise.<br/><br/>For this being the first season the Academy nominates 10 films for the big Oscar, and considering they have nominated past films like Little Miss Sunshine and Juno, they BETTER nominate this one."
"i3i2iain","9","4","8","22 July 2009"," It's a beautiful and immensely satisfying film
","In (500) Days of Summer, music video director Marc Webb transitions into the feature world by telling the story of Tom, a man who firmly believes that true love and happiness are mutually inclusive, and Summer, the woman Tom falls hopelessly in love with but who does not believe in the idea of love herself. The two set out on a tentative relationship, undefined on her insistence, and the story follows the 500 days from when they first meet each other.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom with a fantastic blend of awkward shyness and modest charm. His earnest pursuit of Summer, played effervescently by Zooey Deschanel, unfolds with equal amounts of hilarious courtship missteps and gracious charm. For this story to work, the audience has to fully believe in Tom and his budding relationship with Summer, and Gordon-Levitt makes that all possible. His performance here is stellar, crafting a character that the audience not only wants to root for, but in which they can see a bit of themselves as well. He idealizes without being impractical, and broods but not to annoyance. Hopeless romantics typically can come off as desperate or extreme, but Gordon-Levitt plays him with more than enough charisma to win us over.<br/><br/>Deschanel is excellent too. She's played a lot of the same roles over the past couple of years, that of the too-commonly seen manic pixie dream girl, and frankly it's an element that is definitely present here as well. However, there's also a grounded-ness to the character, an honesty to how she was written and the way Deschanel plays her that makes Summer so much more successful than the Happy of Gigantic. Sure, she's alluring and enigmatic, but she's also selfish and temperamental, even occasionally cruel. On the spectrum of MPDG's, she's more akin to Kate Winslet's Clementine from Eternal Sunshine than Natalie Portman's Sam from Garden State; in other words, she works here both as that tantalizing creature who ""exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures,"" as Nathan Rabin coined it, and also as a rounded woman who we recognize and can relate to from our own lives.<br/><br/>That edge of ""realness"" to the characters is something that is most refreshing about (5oo) Days of Summer. Full disclosure: this movie is full of whimsical and fantastical moments, and has more than a fair share of cheeky, 4th-wall-breaking winks at the audience. However, not only is all of that executed with a finesse and restraint that would put Ferris Bueller to shame, there's a surprising candor to the story. Despite an at-times wacky cast (Chloe Moretz, however, deserves special mention in playing Tom's precocious kid-sister Rachel with a level- headedness that always eluded Dakota Fanning), the lead characters feel whole and fleshed-out. The relationship between Tom and Summer is treated respectfully and sugar-free, taking on its often messy turns with a sincerity and eloquence that doesn't ever feel forced or overly contrived.<br/><br/>That relationship is also what obviously drives the movie, and it is carried by the chemistry between the two leads. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel play off each other so well here. There's one particular scene in the copy room at the company where Tom and Summer work that just comes together completely naturally and hilariously. The audience goes through the stages of their relationship and buys in to their ups and downs because it never feels like two Hollywood actors reading lines off a page, but rather two people actually sharing an experience.<br/><br/>Marc Webb does an amazing job here, weaving together so many elements that could easily be jarring or alienating and instead turns it all into a brilliant mosaic of love in life. He's knocked his feature directorial debut out of the park, and even the few flaws are easily overlooked for the deft touch he brings to a playful and touching tale. His background in music is clearly evident here, as he's populated the film with a soundtrack that is an eclectic mix of classic tunes and catchy indie melodies sure to get the hipster crowd all atwitter. It's probably only the second film this year after Star Trek that was so enjoyable I wanted to watch it again right away. But while Star Trek was an amazing and pulse-pounding thrill ride, (500) Days is more the insightful and memorable road trip, packed full of laughs and good-feeling.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer tells us from the start: ""This is not a love story."" In that statement, the wry and observant narrator is not entirely correct. (500) Days of Summer is a lot of things - it's both funny and moving, as refreshing as it is honest, and thoughtful in one wave and provocative in another. It's a unique mix of whimsy and real, a genuine portrait of a relationship embellished with the colors and soundtrack that only emotions can evoke in our lives. It's a beautiful and immensely satisfying film, and so I endeavor to amend the above misguided statement to just an understatement: ""This is not just a love story.""<br/><br/><ul><li>Roy from http://www.cinemaverytasty.com</li></ul>"
"KeisKid86","10","4","8","2 February 2009"," A new twist on the romantic comedy
","Other than Dead Snow, the film that I most enjoyed at Sundance 2009 was 500 Days of Summer, a romantic-comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel, two amazing actors known for their indie roles. Right from the beginning the movie warns the audience that it is not a love story, and this is only somewhat true. The film is a non-linear look at the 500 days that Joseph's character (Tom) is infatuated/in love with Zooey's character (Summer), all of the ups, downs, and in between stages. What sets this film apart from the genre is that the story is told not from the female perspective, but rather from the male perspective which is very rarely seen in romantic comedies. While it becomes clear that the film is in fact not a love story about Tom and Summer, it turns out to be a love story between Tom and life/love itself. In the beginning of the movie we see Tom as the type of person who love's his life and when he meets Summer he only seems to love it more. As the movie progresses and we see the deterioration of their relationship, so deteriorates the love that Tom has for his life and love in general. However, by the end of the film, though he is not reunited with Summer, Tom has a newfound understanding of life and love, and his character is brought full circle, but a little older and a little wiser."

"Bored_Dragon","8","2","3","4 May 2020"," ""This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story.""
","Yes, it is, this is a love story. But this is not a typical love story we are used to seeing on film and the kind we are used to reading in love novels. This is neither a romanticized tragic love from heartbreaking dramas, nor a ""lived happily ever after"" fairy-tale, nor a romantic comedy. This is the story of love as it really is - silly and serious, gleeful and pathetic, seductive and painful, enlightening and ignorant, energetic and depressing, full of unexpected joy and disappointing, all of that randomly and at the same time ... and above all unpredictable, like life itself. Few of us can identify with Romeo and Juliet, or Don Juan, but I believe that most of us have at least once experienced something similar to this, and this makes this film much stronger and more lifelike than most love stories. Because this is not so much a story about love, as it is about life.<br/><br/>8/10"
"J49afc","9","2","3","21 April 2020"," A masterpiece
","""This is not a love story"" the narrator tells us. And it's not. It's a story about love. And boy is it a story done well.<br/><br/>The boy, Tom Hansen (Joseph Grodon-Levitt) meets the girl, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) whilst working for the same greeting card company in Los Angeles. They have very conflicting ideas about love, with Tom believing in soulmates, fate and 'the one', with Summer doubting the aforementioned.<br/><br/>The connection (and subsequent disconnection) of Tom and Summer is portrayed so authentically and done in such a nuanced way, thanks to the incredible performances by Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel, and the charming script, courtesy of the incredibly talented writing team of Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. There are also some hilarious comedic moments interspersed throughout the film that retain the charm shared in the script.<br/><br/>The unique style of the film- sections in black and white, portions in a square aspect ratio, split screen shots, recreations of obscure European vintage cinema and pieces to camera from some of the characters really help to keep the viewer interested and entertained. The non-linear storytelling, with the film jumping back and forth between different points in Tom and Summer's relationship, goes against the grain of typical, more linear movies. These aspects of the film come together to create a different yet refreshing way to tell a story.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the film (done by Eric Steelberg) is top notch and elevates the meaning and significance of so many scenes. The best example of this is the 'Expectation vs Reality' scene. The painstaking level of detail that went into the planning of every camera angle and movement, the colour palette, the lighting and the framing of each shot makes it, in my opinion, not just one of the best scenes of the film but one of the best scenes in cinema history.<br/><br/>The genius of this film is underscored by the incredible soundtrack. Two contrasting songs from Regina Spektor- the chirpy and cheerful 'Us', creating a beautiful opening sequence, to the melancholic 'Hero', crowning the heart-wrenching 'Expectations vs Reality' scene. From British pop ballads by The Smiths, mirroring the introduction we are given to Tom, to the beautiful 'Sweet Dispositon' by The Temper Trap, that expertly compliments the backdrop and buildings of Los Angeles, it heightens the atmosphere tremendously.<br/><br/>One thing I very much enjoyed was the ending to the film. So many Hollywood films in the past would have taken the obvious route out but I appreciate the decision to stray away from that. Not only does it keep the film from being cliche but it keeps the film grounded and true to life. The closure we received from Tom and Summer's last interactions show a great deal of character development, with both of the two 'meeting in the middle' on their seemingly affirmed beliefs and learning something from one another that they can take into not only future relationships, but the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>The astounding performances and wonderful screenplay culminates in an extraordinary directorial debut for Mark Webb. It's a shame it took me 11 years to discover this wonderful film. It is heart-warming, poignant and moving. One of my favourite films of all time."
"cricketbat","8","2","3","3 August 2018"," Not your average romantic comedy
","(500) Days of Summer is not your average romantic comedy. In fact, I don't think it belongs in the same category as a romantic comedy - it has a completely different feel to it. It has a fantastic soundtrack and Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job of playing the broken-hearted everyman. So what if Zooey Deschanel annoyed me? I liked this movie and I would recommend it to others."
"Donatien3","8","2","3","28 May 2012"," Refreshingly realistic
","We all know the basic rom-com template: ""boy meets girl/boy loses girl/boy wins girl back in improbable finale to live happily ever after"". It's been done to death, with the small varieties of the same old formula trotted out every year. <br/><br/>Fortunately '500 Days of Summer' is a giant breath of fresh air. Unlike the clichéd rom-com, it's not afraid to depict a realistic relationship: from the giddy early days, the painful breakup and everything in between, with the gorgeous Zooey Deschanel (Summer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Tom) as the leads.<br/><br/>'500 Days' depicts Tom and Summer's relationship in a non-liner pattern, with numbered titles indicating the stage of their relationship. Tom is an optimistic believer in true love while Summer thinks relationships are a waste of time. This movie is in parts painful and hopeful. Tom falls madly in love with a woman who seems out his league (at least physically) and slowly cracks begin to appear in their relationship. A great example is comparable visits to a furniture store. In the early days of their relationship, Tom's jokes about all the appliances being broken make Summer laugh. Fast forward to later in the 500-day timeline and those exact same jokes are met with silence.<br/><br/>Tom is the focal point of the movie, and it's easy to sympathise him. Not only does he look like a 'normal' person (as opposed to the usual six foot tall and ridiculously handsome rom-com male lead), but we can see his pain as he starts out believing he's no chance with Summer, to falling in love with her and slowly realising that she doesn't love him in the same way. This is something most 'average' men can relate to: falling for a woman who seems too good for them, only to painfully discover they don't feel the same way, regardless of how much they seem to care. <br/><br/>While the film can be depressing at times (especially when Tom seems to be given a second chance with Summer only to discover she's engaged), it does end on a hopeful note for Tom. The pain he went through with Summer forces him to re-evaluate his life and pursue his true love of architecture, which also leads to a possible new love interest.<br/><br/>There's a real chemistry between Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt and the relationship is believable. Deschanel plays to her ""manic pixie dream girl"" strengths and, as always, comes off as charming and adorable. Gordon-Levitt portrays all the insecurities and foibles of the ""average"" man while still coming off as likable.<br/><br/>While the film is about a failed relationship, the underlining message seems to be about personal growth. While Tom and Summer were never meant to be, both characters grow because of the relationship and start improving their lives. It shows that, despite the short-term pain, a failed relationship isn't the end of the world, but an opportunity to learn and grow for the next one."
"samzee38","8","2","3","16 May 2012"," A movie of your life.
","Only in a few ways is, ""an off-beat romantic comedy"" a fair description. It does little to embody the true nature of this film, which, is far greater than what can be said in a few words.<br/><br/>Rather loosely do I consider this film a ""Rom Com."" By comparison to others, yes -- you may call it ""off-beat."" However, in ways that mere words will do little to express, I found it incredibly ON-beat. If your heart beats at all like Tom Hansen's, you will be in awe at how perfectly this film mirrors and embodies your deepest experiences with girls like Summer Finn. In this way, the story is amazingly realistic, and the connection that is carefully crafted between viewer and movie is absolutely profound. It reaches out to you blindly, KNOWING it will grab your hand.<br/><br/>The scenes between Tom and Summer are virtually perfect. Perfect in the sense that they form the core essence of the film which is based on a true story -- that story being your life. In this way, I consider the movie non-fiction. Everything about it is so archetypal. The experiences, the characters. Summer Finn is the EPITOME of those her type, and if you can relate to this film as much as I can, you will INEVITABLY think of certain girls from your past. Even more profoundly, certain scenes may trigger flashbacks of your past -- it's THAT relatable.<br/><br/>By comparison with it's artistically liberal nature, its cinematic approach is a bit uncomplicated and perhaps at times slightly sub-par. On one hand, I consider it a very realistic movie and in that way, less is more. On the other however, I feel the camera work and editing could have been a bit more interesting. There were some sweet spots here and there, likely inspired by the French New Wave approach of ""The Graduate,"" but ultimately the cinematography had a lot more potential to lend itself to the emotion of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a phenomenal film. It plays in an odd time signature, experimenting with key, scale, and tempo changes, but again: If you're like me or Tom Hansen, you know that it plays to the beat of a broken heart, and that's beautiful."
"cuppa_tetleys","9","2","3","27 June 2011"," Romance told from the guy's point of view. And done fantastically.
","I'll be the first to admit that I don't like Romance films; I find them to be a bit too fantastical, but in the wrong way, and extremely predictable. When I mean the wrong type of fantastical, I mean that it is an unrealistic play-through of how real life events could, in reality, occur, though only through astronomical coincidence. For example, bumping into the girl you love after you've broken up in the place you used to feed the ducks, and then doing some extreme romantic gesture, like dancing on a rooftop, to win her back etc. That doesn't click with me, because these romantic films are set in our world, our reality. The rules are established from the principal contact - this will not feature any space-monkeys, will be entirely within our realm of physics and as a result, I can't take such implausible coincidences. <br/><br/>We enjoy films like the Inception, The Lord of the Rings, because they take place in a world where the rules are established to beyond our capacity to understand in reality. And in that fantasy, anything can happen and suspension of disbelief does the rest. But in our world, things like that don't happen - we've all been in relationships so we know for a fact, film romance is not ever applicable, and as a result, we don't learn anything, we don't grow by travelling these characters, we're just killing time. Although you might call me stupid, saying films would be boring if they only remained within our mundane reality, I say this when taking into account the tired cliché love formula, that pretty much stays the same no matter what route you take or what spin you put on it. We know that everything will be all right in the end and the characters will kiss on a bridge with candlelight and the beautiful lit sky. Not in this film.<br/><br/>The film in question takes the tired formula and breaks it over its knee with some of the most inventive story-telling and camera work I've ever seen - and this is technically an independent film. The acting is superb throughout - the two leads Joseph Gorden-Levitt and Zoe Deshcanel are spectacular and their chemistry is contagious. These are not actors - these are real people. We love these people and we want to see their relationship develop.<br/><br/>Another rare thing for a Rom-com - it's funny. I can sit through the majority of crap with Hugh Grant and maybe chuckle a few times, this gets you laughing from the get go and then becomes serious at the appropriate moments. This is another film that I call a 'moment picture'. A film that contains these small sections in little moments that are either a stroke of genius, a powerful emotional impact, or something that just makes you euphoric watching, regardless of overall quality. These moments are memorable, and they are the parts you talk about after you've seen it. You can watch any number of films that contain no moments at all or maybe one or two - this is full of them. Combined with excellent pacing and consistent engaging content it makes this film, to me, flawless. The only reason I don't give it a 10, is because although perfect, It's not quite up there with the other films I've rated 10, but that is by no means a detriment to this film.<br/><br/>In short, watch it."
"chupchupglande","3","2","3","12 August 2010"," not a romantic movie per se, disappointing
","The movie was really disappointing, what depicts reflects real life, every day stuff, but let's be honest.. if you go with your girlfriend to the cinema with the promise of a romantic movie, you'll feel robbed with this movie!.. the quality of the movie is very good, an incorporates some original things like the day counter, you can see how things were before and after some days, but everything else is a big stereotype and cliché. Some moments can be extremely boring and you feel like leaving the palace or watching something else if you have it on DVD.<br/><br/>If you want a romantic movie, to watch with your partner and have fun, and feel warm and happy at the end (and then proceed with your OWN romance.. is not that the goal of romantic movies?.. ).. SKIP THIS ONE!.."
"noriu-balandeliu","9","2","3","12 March 2010"," A non-typical romance film
","I know only two films qualifying as romance which I think are better (The Science of Sleep, and of course, The Graduate). Well, you know, I hate the genre in general, so I guess any film which has something more to it than just a happy love story with a wedding between the main characters in the end would make it in my top romance films. <br/><br/>First with the problems. There are some clichés in this film (the smart little sister, the righteous guy who transforms and sets to follow his true vocation, fight in the bar for a girl etc.), sometimes the situations seem unnatural (the drunken singing, fight in the bar, the somewhat strange boss and coworkers). <br/><br/>Now the good things. One of the first things you notice is the wonderful indie soundtrack. It really sets a nice mood on the film and is fun to listen. I really liked some of the decisions the director made. The ""expectations vs reality"" scene is wonderful, the city fading to a drawing which is then erased is also nice, the IKEA scene is also very lovable, although I can't get over the feeling this idea has already been somewhere. But I liked the most the moral of the story. I myself have had my Summer, and now I am so happy with my Autumn. With the first girl, there was so much expectations from my side that I was terribly upset when it went wrong. I then of course met another girl and this time after 3 years we are still happy with each other and it looks she might just be the one. Both my relationships happened by accident. So I have also come to realise that although I love my girl so much at the moment, I would have found another and fallen in love with her instead if not that accident. That love is not something fate determines, but what you make of the series of relationships by the method of trial and error, finding the person who is really good for you.<br/><br/>To all who argue this film has a happy ending which spoils the film. Where is it said that they lived happily ever after? It's just a new relationship, a new page which could be anything. Which could be whatever the persons make of it. They could say bye to each other after that cup of coffee, or they could marry and have kids eventually. This is just a reminder that there's always a next chance after your heart is broken."
"SeaCal","5","2","3","6 February 2010"," Tagline says it all (and I mean all)
","Tagline is ""Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."" This is about all the plot is, other than some quality production and acting.<br/><br/>The bad: The plot was way too predictable, and the characters simplistic. How many times does a girl need to say I'm not in love with you for you to get the message? If you're a teenager it's understandable, but not as an adult! The fact that the characters write greeting card is silly -- conveniently it allows the characters to express the way they're really feeling. This is how everyone knows how Tom himself really feels. At least we now know who these people are who get paid well to write a few lines of clichés a month.<br/><br/>The good: The acting is good -- Joseph Gordon-Levitt is convincing as the boy with the crush, and it is easy to like him because he remains faithful to his feelings. I also like that he is able to effectively display his feelings. His charm on the screen makes the plot seem richer than it is.<br/><br/>Zooey is also believable, although I would expect her to have rejected Tom early and put even more distance between them. She has a strong screen presence, and plays a good ""too good to fall in love"" character.<br/><br/>I do like the idea of flipping the days around, but sadly I think this is necessary to keep the plot from being boring. The other redeeming thing was that Summer didn't leave her husband at the end.<br/><br/>The production is polished, the editing and photography are well done, and I do like the random LA scenes which are easily identifiable -- eg the Ahmanson theatre and downtown overlooks which are good settings for the moods the film tries to make.<br/><br/>Summary: Overall this film is a slick production, but way too predictable. The hero doesn't waiver in his pursuit, and the target of his affections never falls for him. So what is the point of the movie? It certainly isn't ""love conquers all"" . . . what is it?"
"moviemanMA","10","2","3","27 July 2009"," Redefining the genre
","Love. One of most confusing words in the English language. A person can love another person, a sandwich, a car, a feeling, and a host of other things, people, and places. Love. Just four letters that mean so much.<br/><br/>In Marc Webb's directorial debut (500) Days of Summer, we find out exactly what love is. A while ago I saw the trailer for this film and it came with a warning: ""This is not a love story. This is a story about love."" This could not have been a truer statement.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Tom Hansen. He is currently employed at a greeting cards company in Los Angeles but dreams of making it as an architect, someday. His life is rather ordinary until he meets his boss' new secretary, Summer Finn, played by Zooey Deschanel. After their first encounter, Summer is the only thing that Tom can think of. He knows that this is the girl, this is ""the one"". Tom believes that love is out there waiting for him. Summer on the other hand feels the opposite, that true love belongs in songs and fairy tales. What happens when these two ideals collide?<br/><br/>The resulting relationship the two embark on is unlike any other put on celluloid. It's a beautiful, tragic, comic, musical, whimsical tale of love, heartache, and life lessons. Each era of film has ""the couple"" that reflect the ideals and mannerisms of the time. There was Roman Holiday, The Graduate, When Harry Met Sally, Singles, and up until now, Garden State. Here comes the next generation of lovers. This film shows the intimate details of a modern day romance from dating to the bedroom.<br/><br/>There is so much I want to say but can't because it would spoil not just the story but the fun. Webb employs some unique storytelling techniques. Each scene offers something new both stylistically as well as changing the direction of the film ever so slightly. Along the way we bounce back and forth in Tom and Summer's relationship showing the highs and lows and everything in between.<br/><br/>Webb's unique style appears to be influenced by several other directors. There are a few homages to other films and movements, something I enjoyed immensely. I sensed that Goddard, Fellini, Minnelli, and a few others were inspiration for certain scenes.<br/><br/>One thing Webb does right is use his actors correctly. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are magical on screen together. They make each scene worth while with their delivery and on screen presence. No lines are wasted, no looks go unnoticed. They nail the mood and purpose of the film.<br/><br/>I cannot stress enough how amazing and important the soundtrack is in this film. Like The Graduate or Garden State, we have a great selection of songs, each serving both an entertainment and story telling purpose. Songs from artists like The Smiths, Regina Spektor, The Temper Trap, and Hall & Oates give the film a way to communicate with the audience on more than one level.<br/><br/>I can't stress enough how amazing (500) Days of Summer really is. It's a new twist on a tired genre of indie romance films. It has everything you could possibly want from a film. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. It's a remarkable achievement, especially for such a small production. Bravo Mr. Webb. I greatly anticipate your next film."
"CatfishOpinions","8","1","1","17 June 2020"," Good- but NOT A LOVE STORY
","I wanted to watch this because I heard a lot of people talk about how good it was. I was surprised to hear narration in the beginning, something most critics hate in a movie, narration that isn't even a character, but I could forgive it because I don't mind narration in movies. One thing I probably should have listened to more is the narrator saying ""this is not a love story"".<br/><br/>Since the movie ends with them breaking up (haha spoiler), I guess it's trying to let you know that this is gonna be more of an analysis of a failed relationship rather than a happy-ending love story, which I would totally be up for as long as I was ready for it. I think a better option would be to show them breaking up (the 500th day) first in the movie, to let you know that it ain't gonna work visually instead of telling you. I think I wouldn't have had my hopes up if I hadn't falsely remembered a spoiler saying they would get back together. I don't know where I got that from.<br/><br/>Anyway, once you remind yourself that this isn't meant to be a romance, this movie is really fun. It's super funny and I love some of the gimmicks they do, like telling you the day of the relationship, flipping back and forth in time, and that one musical number in the middle (which is no doubt the best scene in the whole movie). I like how they accurately portray emotions without making it too gloomy or over-poetic, which a lot of ""oFfbEaT rOmAnTiC cOmEdIeS"" tend to do. Overall, this is a great movie that I think everyone should watch, and I think there should be more movies made with this style and energy.<br/><br/>Oh yeah I think this goes without saying, but...dreamboat joseph gordon-levitt."

","I like rom/coms but sometimes it's disturbing that films see through rose glasses. In this movie director shows the what love is in real life. I would consider it ends with happy but not love wise, it's more discovering the life and love.<br/><br/>Tom discovering that he thought she will be his only but he doesn't see from her side.<br/><br/>I feel like this film really inspired from 'Annie Hall.' Plot is similar, except the chronology. Also film have a lot of experimental scenes like 'expectations vs reality' or 'the theater' scene."

"barkinunluer","10","1","1","1 May 2018"," This Is Not a Love Story, This Is a Modern Masterpiece.
","500 Days of Summer is a complete modern classic. The fluent story, the acting and the chemistry between Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are exceptional. <br/><br/>Also the director, Marc Webb was a music video director before this first movie he made. He directed a lot of emo band's videos like My Chemical Romance and AFI which he gained so much experience from using music in a video. That's why, 500 Days also look like a very long music video with its 1:30 hour time and its largely usage of the soundtrack album. This perfect album is full of modern and classic indie bands with quality.<br/><br/>The storytelling is absolutely adorable. If you are a man, you can relate yourself with Tom and love (and hate) Summer. And if you are a woman, well, i don't know lol.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the most important thing of a work of art is the ability to make you watch / listen / read again. If you like a song, you listen to it once again, right? And i really love that movie which make me watch over and over again.<br/><br/>Just like the storyteller said in the movie: This is not a love story. So aware of this beautiful truth and enjoy it!"

","I first watched this film when it was released in theaters in 2009. I thought it was good but I'm really not one for romantic comedies. I just watched the film for the second time recently and it honestly was amazing. I don't think that this movie deserves to be called a romantic comedy because it purely romantic. While there is comedy and very funny comedy I may add. The film is about love and the pros and cons of it.<br/><br/>This film makes the audience feel amerced in a relationship that only people can wish for but it is clear from the way the story is told that the relationship will not last. The film shows what is possible in life, even the best of times can lead to the worst of time and when the best of times are over they will start again if you give it a chance.<br/><br/>I'be never been one to believe in fate but this is the best example that makes me think that it is possible. <br/><br/>On another note the way the story is told with title cards, narration, dance sequences, archived footage and many other forms of filming is absolutely enjoyable. The acting is also fantastic.<br/><br/>Last word, the expectation Vs. reality sequence is incredible."

","Very beautiful, heart-warming and realistic. A twist in the romantic comedy genre with well rounded characters. The main character Tom is kinda arrogant, but is still extremely likable. This is a definite sign of good character development.<br/><br/>All of the acting was good, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel were believable. They often gave a few laughs in the way they portray the characters. Certain techniques add to the comedy or are just unique/fun. My favourite editing technique was the expectation versus reality split screen. <br/><br/>The narrative structure was interesting, linking certain days with others. It doesn't confuse the audience due to the constant transitions to the day number. I like the use of this technique, it really subverts the romantic comedy genre. A must see for lovers of any film genre!"
"Galina_movie_fan","9","1","1","7 November 2017"," This is not a love story... But it is about love
","Finally, the day has arrived and I can happily say that I have lived to see something that I almost lost my hope to see - a truly original, clever, beautiful, creative, funny and moving, modern American romantic comedy. Nothing is new in this world. It is impossible to come up with the new plot about love or possibility of love, or expectation of love or losing it but it is possible to look at the old story with a fresh eye and to make the movie as enchanting as 500 Days of Summer. The first time director Marc Webb has started on a very high note. His movie is charming (I know I use this word a lot but it describes 500 days perfectly). It combines many different techniques and succeeds adorably in following two leads and their 500 days of getting together and gradually drifting apart. Not often, I see the movie that makes me smile from the beginning to the end. I felt like that big silly grin was glued to my face and I did not mind at all. It is nothing Webb did that I have not seen before. He applies the broken narrative and jumping back and forward in time. His use of split screen technique creates the best scene in the film with many memorable scenes. He inserts a musical number that seems to come from a Bollywood movie and changes the real world into animation. Yes, we have seen this all before but together these tricks have mixed in something magical, delicately bittersweet and funny without being stupid, loud, vulgar, and pushy.<br/><br/>The big part of the magic is without a doubt an undeniable palpable chemistry between two leads, both known for their previous performances in the independent movies. Zooey Deschanel (Summer) was the best part of All the Real Girls (2003). As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Tom), now, eight years after 500 days of Summer, he has become one of the best actors of his generation.<br/><br/>Marc Webb's debut feature generated many positive reviews, and it deserves them. Time will tell if 500 Days of Summer becomes Annie Hall for the modern time. I believe it is that good. There were few things that I did not like very much, for example a clichéd smart-alecky rather annoying character of pre-teen sister of Tom. Nevertheless, the entire movie is so wonderful that I don't want to nit-pick and would recommend it highly.<br/><br/>P.S. Wherever you are, Jenny Beckman, I want to thank you for having inspired this movie."

But I dislike the way this movie isn't as clear as it should be: people might see this movie and blame Summer for everything and not realise what it's like for women to meet a guy like Tom.<br/><br/>This movie is good, but also seriously frustrating because of Tom.

","You have to go through summer to get to autumn. As narrated at the start of this film this is not a love story, more like a what you think love is might not be story. <br/><br/>What I enjoyed about this film is how it pulls back the bland layers left by hundreds of previous attempts to capture what love is about and instead shows us how the journey unfolds and how we can end up in completely different destination than we imagined. <br/><br/>From the beginning I expected a harsh cautionary tale of love but what really surprised me and to be honest what made the film was the ending. Up until then it was following well trodden paths of the love can be great but also hurt scenario which we as humans know all too well, but I feel like the ending delivered a uplifting and positive message in what was an otherwise darker film. <br/><br/>We followed the film as viewers expecting Tom to go through hard times but eventually he and Summer would realise they're perfect for each other and ride off into the sunset holding hands living happily ever after, However very reminiscent of the film they mentioned 'The Graduate' this was not the case. <br/><br/>Instead we see how your belief system can be rocked and everything you thought you knew about love can completely change. Like Tom we all may never understand why Summer did the things she did or why she behaved in such a manor but for Tom all of that is a now just a simple footnote on how he reached his actual true love... Autumn.<br/><br/>Overall a film that follows others in exposing the darker side to love, but completely side swipes us with a happy ending and leaves us with a smile on our face and content to know that although we may lose faith, Love can reach us at any moment."

The movie ended up really surprising me with how much I enjoyed it and how well made it was.<br/><br/>Most consider the movie a romantic comedy and if you disagree I wont argue with that assessment either. So while many deem it a rom com, it is also an intelligent well movie that any cinema fan can appreciate.<br/><br/>The movie does a great job of flipping back and forth (ala Annie Hall) to different points of the relationship to illustrate the complexity and contrasting points of relationships. <br/><br/>An example of this is when Tom mentions how much he likes April's quirks like biting her lip, her birth mark etc when the relationship was going great. But then later in the movie after they were broken up he angrily says how much hates those exact same quirks in a manner that was funny and relatable in real life.<br/><br/>Another intriguing part of the movie is my opinion seems to change every time I watch the movie as to how much each character is at fault for how it ended. Both characters are flawed and at fault to an extent, but it's in such a manner it's never clear exactly how, why and who is truly to blame.<br/><br/>Relationships are incredibly complicated and I think the movie does a great job of portraying the complexity of relationships.<br/><br/>Other points:<br/><br/>The leads of JGL and Deschanel are great<br/><br/>The expectation vs reality scene is phenomenal<br/><br/>The movie can attempt to be too quirky and some of the humor just seems out of place."

This work also showed an excellent performance of Zooey Deschanel with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, couple who got an interesting chemistry in providing a novel with plenty of comedy and reality. Used arguments and elements that are not usually explored, a worthy soundtrack of big Hollywood productions highlighting including indie music. The scenarios used were very well selected, all characters who engages with key has a well structured story. The performance of Chloë Grace Moretz was amazing, she has the supporting role but with a very great importance to the plot."

","I heard so much positive things about this movie that I never got around to it until the trailers made me wanna see it. Out of curiosity, I bought a DVD copy and it was worth my $3! This movie was fascinating from beginning to end.<br/><br/>It's about a man who falls in love with his co-worker and things seem wonderful but everything abruptly changes. That's as far as I'll go with discussing the plot, because I don't wanna spoil anything. Let's just say that it was an unpredictable and hypnotic experience. <br/><br/>Here are the good things about it. Joseph Gordon Levitt is perfectly cast and has a great screen presence. The writing is witty and quirky, which I really thought was a smart move for the filmmakers. Webb (the director) has a precise vision and you could see it in every frame. One last thing, don't expect this to be a laugh-out-loud comedy or else you will be easily disappointed by it. There are a couple chuckles here and there but it's not one of those raunchy, crude humored sort of movie.<br/><br/>If you go in with an open mind and don't expect a hilarious comedy, you'll really enjoy it for what it is."

When he meets girl( Zoeey Deschanel) he thinks he found all three.However this girl doesn't believe in things like love. But ironically, in the end they are convinced the other is right. <br/><br/>This movie teaches us, that sometimes the deepest you'll ever fall will result in true happiness.

What's so great about this movie is that it is REAL, in the simplest terms it's not some fabricated fairytale of true-love, but something true about love, just like the teaser trailer states, ""this is not a love story, it's a story about love."" Something just as simple as that turn of phrase, I think, brings more of an audience, in, that can relate with the characters Tom and Summer. Zooey as always has that heart meltingly cute charm and excellent singing voice that just captures you where as Joseph deeply plays that hopeless romantic guy, perfectly carrying your heart through all of his highs and lows.

"gi_feitosa","10","1","1","24 March 2013"," Film review: (500) days of Summer Directed by: Marc Webb Actors: Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt
","This unusual romantic comedy will certainly surprise who sees it. In the beginning of the movie it's said: ""This is not a love story. This is a story about love."" And so it is. Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who has a degree in Architecture and writes greeting cards falls in love at first sight for Summer (Zooey Deschanel), his new coworker and a girl who doesn't believe in true love.<br/><br/>As time goes by, they start to know each other better and a romance begins. Their story is not showed in a chronological order. The days appear to us in a random order, and we can enjoy their happy and in love days and cry with Tom when they have an argument. This delightful comedy directed by Marc Webb gives us the chance to reflect about a real life romance and that things not always happen as we wish. I couldn't imagine a better actress to interpret this character unless Zooey Deschanel. Protagonist of the movie Yes Man (2008) and actually the protagonist of the TV series New Girl (2012), Zooey keeps her sweet and adorable way of act. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt, well-known for the roles in 10 things I hate about you (1999) and Manic (2001) is interpreting such a sweet young man that everyone hopes that Summer and Tom continue together forever. This cute and surprising love story will make you feel all kind of emotions in 95 minutes. Get ready!"
"piratecannon","9","1","1","26 December 2012"," It's entertaining and thoughtful, a combination that's extraordinarily rare in the rom-coms I've encountered thus far in 2009.
","I have hope for the romantic comedy. After enduring February's He's Just Not That Into You, I really started to believe that the future for this particular genre, in terms of any sort of artistic appeal or entries that have any weight to them at all, was dismal. There have been some notable offerings over the last year or so in the form of some energetic indie films, but nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>But then comes along first-time director Marc Webb with an enjoyable little number that has, at least for the time being, restored my faith in the rom-com. Remember the bliss that was Garden State? Think of (500) Days of Summer as a slightly more mature, infinitely more whimsical relative of the 2004 Zach Braff hit.<br/><br/>The story follows the exploits of Tom Hansen, a twenty-something who grew up with rock-solid faith in the promise that there is such a thing as true love and that it's waiting for that perfect moment to manifest itself in our lives. He works as a writer for a greeting card company: you know, the ones that turn out the same ""Hang in there!"" drivel you often find at your local Hallmark. Things are mediocre as usual until the day Tom's boss hires Summer Finn as an assistant. Tom is instantly mesmerized by her, and does all he can to catch her attention.<br/><br/>The cat and mouse game that results is well crafted, funny, and true to life. Though things start to tire slightly at the conclusion, witnessing the evolution of the relationship between Tom and Summer is a real treat, and it shows that screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber have a real eye for the nuanced interactions that comprise the modern relationship for many people. The whole thing is intermittently narrated (literally and figuratively) too, which helps provide a decidedly ""fairy tale""-esque panache that both delivers on the promises we're fed during childhood and dashes them by deftly exploring the not- so-pretty harshness of how relationships often play out in the real world. All of this is nicely underscored by the fact that both Tom and Summer's parents are divorced–a key point that plays into their own expectations regarding relationships (particularly Summer's). This is made especially clear in a scene during which Tom and Summer purposely become lost in the maze that comprises their local Ikea. The pair jokingly takes on the stereotypical roles expected of a man and wife, with Summer cheerfully removing imaginary food from an oven and Tom sitting at a spotless kitchen table. He beams with an over-the-top smile, feigning pride in regards to the ""mock life"" that him and his partner have fostered. There's some real subtextual resonance here, and it shows that everyone involved in (500) Days of Summer really wanted to create a film that goes beyond mere entertainment–they wanted to make something that their audience can relate to.<br/><br/>There's also an artistic flair to the movie that makes it that much more interesting. Though it's rather infrequent, scenes sometimes transition into rough sketches mimicking those that Tom, who was schooled in architecture (though he chose not to pursue it as a career), pens in his notepad during his afternoon musings in a downtown Los Angeles park. The film even includes some cartoon animation, which shows Webb's ability to work some perfectly appropriate, albeit cheesy humor into the production. There are one or two instances where it seems as if (500) Days of Summer is ""being indie"" just for the sake of being indie, but these are few and far between. They're also instantly forgivable in the midst of the accomplishments the film manages, especially considering the unrealistic convention that so many recent romantic comedies have fallen victim to.<br/><br/>If you want an enjoyable night at the movies with your significant other, then go check out (500) Days of Summer. It's entertaining and thoughtful, a combination that's extraordinarily rare in the rom-coms I've encountered thus far in 2009."

Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen and Zooey Deschanel as Summer Finn - the main stars - are brilliant and their characters are realistic and convincing; such attitudes towards love, relationship, commitment etc. are common among many younger people.

","I like Zooey Deschannel. Never watched her movie before, but I like her huge eyes, innocent face, the suitable hair do. When I moved my TV channel randomly, I found there were '500 Summer', and Zooey became the lead actress. Wow, I have to watch it! In the beginning of the movie, we were warn : this not a love story. Then what? But I still watch it, since Zooey in the movie. And, what's more attracted me with the appearance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Why his name so familiar? and of course, his face. When every scene, described as what days in those 500 hundred days, I just knew this was not an ordinary movie. This was something! <br/><br/>The scene opened when Summer Finn became new employee at Tom Hansen's office. Tom just grabbed with Summer's beauty and interested to know her better. In karaoke night after office hour, Paul reveal to Summer that seems Tom fancy her. By that time Summer and Tom become getting closer, they spent much time together. They were very closed, but there was no official statement what kind of relationship they had. But Tom, officially, in love with Summer and assumed they had something, while Summer? No, she still tag Tom as her friend. They have floating relation, as Tom find out is there any possibility he and Summer become a couple as he wish? <br/><br/>What I love about this movie is the right lighting and beautiful images. It was in sepia color, made romantic ambiance. and don't forget about the playful narrator, and lesson we can take in love matter. Punch me hard and slap my cheek, instantly. :)) You can keep quotes of this movie, to remind you, love is not like a fairy tale, but love is still, something beautiful to fight for. Oh yes, have to noted about Rachel Hansen here. a 12-year old girl, Tom sister, giving him advice in romance. :)) Overall, really recommend movie to watch. :)"

","500 days of summer is probably the first in a romantic genre to earn a near-perfect score in my favourite list. It has the perfect, unconventional and almost totally un-clichéd method of telling a love story, which by the way is perhaps the most truthful description of the complexities surrounding relationships with a high failure probability in the end.<br/><br/>I also truly salute some of the statements made in this movie -- some examples being the blame on the materialistic nature of the modern world for casting a plastic veil on the integrity of love and why fate is not what it is -- they were so boldly made because they are definite taboos to be mentioned in other romantic movies! Not to mention the ending is probably one of the best i have seen in years! Well, to fall in love with a movie that shows love does not always win but it is not an emotional sore loser either, as one moves on with life from the experience as a better person. Perhaps I may be among the rare breed that feels this is the most honest romantic movie yet."

","First off, with this film being led by Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon- Levitt, I had high expectations, and I can honestly say that it lived up to the expectations. The premise is extraordinary, and profound, however quite mature. The film focuses on a couple whose relationship is solely dedicated to intercourse, but end up having few moments of true unadulterated love. This is not to say that the film was a sex comedy, or for that matter a comedy. It was more of a drama, and it is quite sad in some parts, but none the less it is an amazing film. The acting is, as expected, superb. The script was very well written, and the film flowed very naturally and smooth. The points that it makes about love, and relationships are interesting and very original. The film is very psychological, and impressively toys with your emotions in a good way. Safe to say one of the best films to come out in a long time, and definitely worth the awards that it earned. Amazing, quirky, beautiful, and a good look at pure unadulterated love."
"slokes","7","1","1","1 September 2012"," Love And The Frustrated Architect
","Ah, office love. What could go wrong? A lot, it turns out, when one person's notion of a love to last a lifetime clashes with another's idea of the same situation as a like that will last a lunchtime.<br/><br/>Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a trained architect who has spent his last three-plus years awash in sentimentality, writing greeting cards as he pretends to be satisfied with his life. Enter Summer (Zooey Deschanel), a beautiful receptionist who takes an interest in him, one that blossoms when they discover a passion for some of the same things, like karaoke and theme music from the TV show ""Knight Rider.""<br/><br/>As much a launching pad for a thousand debates as a twisted take on romantic comedy conventions, ""(500) Days Of Summer"" raises a question it never quite gets around to answering about the nature of true love. Still, its ambling quality offers up much pleasure.<br/><br/>So does Deschanel, working her usual magic to less gentle affect than normal. It's impossible to dislike her, with her killer blues or the way her nose crinkles when she laughs. But you can't help feeling frustrated by her, a frustration that the film builds upon by presenting their relationship in a series of non-chronological episodes. Tom the frustrated architect is trying to make reality of his fantasy, but Summer isn't really going along. It's here that the film rubs against familiar romantic comedy conventions and carves out some unique emotional territory.<br/><br/>""I need to know you aren't going to wake up in the morning and feel differently,"" he tells her.<br/><br/>""I can't give you that,"" she replies. ""No one can."" Especially not her, though.<br/><br/>In addition to the two leads, the film is strengthened by the supporting cast, especially Tom's two buddies, loyal office wingman MacKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and the more wistful, happily married Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler). Together they provide a hip Greek chorus to Tom's troubles.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt is a fine, charismatic center for the film. He's part Ahab and part Cary Grant here, getting into a bar fight one moment, the next trying to cover his embarrassment when Summer challenges him to yell the word ""penis"" in a public park as loud as he can. The more he reaches, the more ground he loses, but I think even female viewers will empathize with his concerns. It's funny that the actor himself has said he thinks his character doesn't merit the rooting interest; he may be the only person who thinks that after seeing the movie.<br/><br/>The issue here is not one of gender differences, but different takes on life. I go back to him as a frustrated architect, trying to make the rules he understands work in a situation that doesn't allow for them. She's not one to be tied down by anyone else's plans.<br/><br/>I realize I'm taking the same approach many others take in regard to this film, by focusing on the dramatic issues and ignoring the comedy. It's pretty funny in places, and well-observed, like when he agonizes over how she answers a simple question about how her weekend was. I love one scene early on when he meets her at a company function, and she tells him she had heard he wasn't showing up. ""You asked?"" he blurts out, beaming triumphantly.<br/><br/>The more elaborate comedy sequences don't always come off so well, especially when they become street dancing scenes or parodies of Swedish cinema. These are funny moments, but they don't connect to the main story and become distracting. Worst of all is a rather pat ending, though even that works well enough to let you out with a smile.<br/><br/>What really makes ""(500) Days Of Summer"" work is the bracing way director Marc Webb and writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber raise questions about the nature of love. They don't do as good a job of answering them, but do leave you thinking, success of a kind most rom-coms never attain."
"rooprect","8","1","1","30 August 2012"," Rashômon, the rom-com
","In the first 2 minutes, the narrator warns us ""This is NOT a love story"". I knew this beforehand but still thought it would be a good date movie, so I asked a hot chick to watch it with me. Why am I telling you this? Mostly because I wanted to brag about finally working up the nerve to ask out a hot chick. But also to let you know that ""(500) Days of Summer"" isn't exactly a hot date movie.<br/><br/>So much better, it's a very clever story about perception and particularly how emotions affect perception. In 1950 Kurosawa gave us the legendary film ""Rashômon"" which defined the technique by using multiple narrators to tell the story of a murder. A few years ago, the French film ""He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not"" took the same basic idea and applied it to a love story. Here we have yet another innovation. It's a lovestory highlighting different perspectives, but they're coming from the same person.<br/><br/>How did the director accomplish this? By jumping around the timeline. ""(500) Days of Summer"" begins at Day #488, then back to Day #1, then forward, then back, etc. It can be slightly disorienting at times, but I believe that is the intent. By departing from the standard linear storytelling, the director accentuates the bipolar jumps in perception experienced by a guy who's alternately in & out of love.<br/><br/>I don't know if this has been done before (several people have compared this film to ""Annie Hall"" which I haven't seen), but for me it was a thoroughly original experience.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers yet another charming performance as the handsome nerd who's desperately trying to get a grip. Zooey Deschanel plays a challenging role: one minute lovable, the next minute not-so-lovable (in keeping with the theme of the film), and she truly delivers. You just have to see the movie to know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>If you liked ""Rashômon"" or ""He Loves Me..."" you should definitely check this out & see what you think. I'd also compare it to another great offbeat romcom ""Adam"" and a really offbeat French romcom(?) called ""The Girl from Monaco"".<br/><br/>""(500) Days of Summer"" has spots of comedy & a light-hearted presentation, although its primary focus is the drama & the underlying theme of ""reality vs. expectation"". Again, not the perfect date movie. Although we both liked it, I don't know if I'll get a 2nd date with the hot girl... quick can someone suggest a good Hugh Grant flick?"
"dierregi","8","1","1","28 May 2012"," Young romance at its best
","Bittersweet story about young romance. Young people can fall head over heel for a perfect stranger. Probably it is the hormones and lack of experience coupled with expectations too high. Of course, falling for someone does not guarantee your love will be reciprocated. This is what happens to Tom, a romantic boy, slightly disconnected from reality, who thinks he met the ""one"" only to find out she was not. The ""wrong"" girl is Summer who - allegedly - does not believe in love, but in practice might be just looking for Mr Right.<br/><br/>The story is told in non-linear fashion, which for once enhances the quirky narrative. However, we can easily reconstruct the story, from the day they met - Tom filled with romantic and naive expectations, Summer disconnected from her feelings. When Tom and Summer get together, she feels ""happy"" and finds him ""funny"", but he is convinced she is Ms Right (no explanation is given about the reason of Tom's obsession that Summer is the ""one"").<br/><br/>Things fall apart quite abruptly, when Summer gets in a bad mood and dumps Tom after having watched ""The Graduate"" together. Summer seems a selfish, immature girl who has no clue about what she wants. She lies to herself and to others. Rather than intentionally evil, she just seems frivolous and uncaring, pursuing her own happiness and disregarding whoever does not satisfy criteria she cannot even define.<br/><br/>Tom seems to be a naive victim of literature and music about romantic love. The concept of the ""one"" seems to be a torture device for American audiences, who need to be constantly reassured that such a person actually exists. Unfortunate, romantic concepts are purely fictional. Long-lasting relationships are based on more solid ground than physical attraction and common interests (""We both like Magritte and Hopper"" gushes Tom enthusiastically, as if this is further proof that Summer is his twin soul).<br/><br/>This comedy deals with emotional matters so important for the young in the most charming way and the script, editing and soundtrack are absolutely brilliant."

","I really enjoyed this film, although some might not agree that it is either romantic or a comedy.<br/><br/>We were laughing out loud many times, but there were sad parts too, so I think most people would label this a drama with streaks of black comedy.<br/><br/>The driving force behind what makes this movie work (beside the script) is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen, who carries the movie on the basis of his physical comedy and acting ability. He is the unrequited love interest in the film. JGL does have brief glimpses of true love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel) but it's clear she's not interested in anything permanent, just a good time. After his initial sexual encounter with Summer, JGL engaged in a choreographed dance routine of Hall & Oats ""Your Making my Dreams Come True"", which should win JGL some type of award.<br/><br/>Deschanel plays the role she usually plays, soulful & pretty free spirit. She played the character very well and the movie viewer could well understand her reticence to engage in a long term affair with Tom.<br/><br/>These types of movies might leave some cold, but the ending turned out well.<br/><br/>One additional bonus was Chloe Moritz, who played Tom's younger teenage sister and Psycho-Analyst.

She happens to be his exact contrary female version - she doesn't believe in happy endings and fairy tales. So how exactly do these two very different people end up being a couple for the eponymous 500 days? For all the lovebirds out there, this could mean that sometimes the exception proves the rule! However, I have to blunt right now - sadly, as the viewer is about to find out, the differences and arising conflicts can only produce a disastrous result and drive two people apart.<br/><br/>There are many reasons why I simply fell in love with this picture: it is not a typical movie, due to the fact that it connects some aspects of a typical romance with various features of a down- to-earth drama. This process is best shown through the intersection of parts that show everything in bright and positive colors, with the sun shining and the birds singing, and parts that include rainstorms, dark humor, sad faces and deeply philosophical sentences. This cinematic procedure really invites to get a broader look at this very particular relationship, which can sometimes seem as a smooth and joyful one. And then, just a few seconds later, it provides a scene that changes the perspective 180 degree around.<br/><br/>Great performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. You could certainly see that they had so much fun playing the main parts. What is more, because of the fact that the connection between the two stars carries the whole plot in an amazing fashion, the recognition that they deserve for their wonderful acting should be even bigger.<br/><br/>Personally, I am not a big fan of romantic movies, that is why I didn't know what to expect when I started watching (500) Days of Summer. But in the end I was astonished. It provides a new light onto this genre and changes the way we might perceive it. It stand out from the crowd of all those, mostly boring, standard romances and shows that in real life not everybody ends up living happily ever after - sometimes we have to put up a hell of a fight to get closer to a person we admire. And even then, it's a long way home."

","500 Days of Summer is an excited and romantic story about a guy who is deeply in love with a girl named Summer. In the story, he met this girl and fall in love with her since the first time he saw her and passes 500 days to forget her and move on. The film isn't chronologically, it starts when she already dumped him. Actually, she never loved him back, he was like a friend for her. This movie is a sad story of love, in which Summer brakes the heart of a guy who truly loved her, and in the end he meets a new girl. The story is inconclusive because it starts with another story of love for him, but that's how real life roll, isn't it?"

","First of all i want to start by saying i judge every film i watch by how it makes me feel when the film ends and them credits roll up, and with 500 days of summer i felt every emotion possible along the films Fantastic Journey! The Film tells the story of Tom Hansen(Gordan Levitt)a trained architect who works as a writer at a greeting card company, Tom (a hopeless romantic) doesn't believe he will ever truly be happy (much like myself) until he meets the girl of his dreams or the one! Tom thinks hes found that in Summer Finn (Deschanel) the new assistant to his boss at work.<br/><br/>The rest of the film follows from Toms perspective as he falls deeper and deeper in love with Summer who consistently tells tom she doesn't want to label there relationship and believe's love to be fantasy.<br/><br/>All i can do is encourage you to watch this film as it really is the perfect portrayal of love and love lost in every way. Everything from the Amazing Soundtrack to the Brilliantly believability of Deschanel and Levitts relationship, also the Fantastic Director skills of Marc Webbs in his first film!!! 500 Days Of Summer is the best and most realistic version of the trials and tribulations of love that i have ever seen and anybody who has ever been in love will appreciate this film, 10 out of 10 from me Fantastic.<br/><br/>This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront... This is not a love story."
"Tweekums","8","1","1","12 March 2012"," Falling in love with Summer
","Protagonist Tom works for a greeting cards company and when the boss's new assistant, Summer Finn, walks through the door he is instantly smitten. We know they will get together as the narrative constantly switches between the beginning of relationship and a time a year later when it is falling apart. Before he even invites her out she has told him that she does not believe in love and doesn't like labels like girlfriend and boyfriend but still he ends up inviting her out and things start off well. When she decides to finish things he does not take it well; he loses his happy go lucky attitude and ultimately walks out of his job as he comes to believe he is writing nothing but meaningless platitudes.<br/><br/>This may all sound like a fairly depressing anti-romantic film but in fact it is pretty funny; Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel do great jobs as Tom and Summer and even though she only has a small role Chloë Grace Moretz does a fine job as Tom's little sister who is wise beyond her years and gives him advice. Tom and Summer's relationship was believable from the start where he was in a state of ecstasy to the end where he was devastated and couldn't get over her. There are plenty of good laughs and one which is as disgusting as it is funny... if you've seen it you will know the one I mean! Over all this is worth watching if you want to see a different take on the romance genre."

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel both deliver excellent performances in the lead roles here. The movie blends the drama and comedy together quite well. The story is about Tom(JGL) and Summer(Zooey) who work together at a greeting card company. Over time Tom really starts getting feelings for Summer even though she is upfront with him telling him that she doesn't want a boyfriend. Tom pretends to be cool with this but it's pretty clear that he wants to be more friends with benefits which no matter what Tom does is all that she ever wants from him. After a while she quits her job at the greeting cards company and stops seeing him which leads him into a great depression.<br/><br/>The movie which was an independent production is a sleeper hit. The movie is very clever and offbeat thing going for it."
"drqshadow-reviews","8","1","1","8 February 2012"," Even in Tight Relationships, We All See Things Differently
","The proverb says ""perception is reality,"" but if that's the case we're all living in a world of our own. By way of a repeatedly time-hopping narrative, this film addresses the competing perspectives present in every long-term relationship, and how something as innocuous as a smile can be interpreted completely differently by the two people sharing it. With a ton of post-production tricks and stunts in editing, it runs the risk of being over-conceptual and spoiled, but by keeping a steady focus on that one central point that all winds up complimenting the message nicely. Zooey Deschanel plays her typical hip, quirky character (if you're not already a fan of her act, she won't convince you here) and her pairing with Joseph Gordon-Levitt feels fun and natural while it lasts. Both characters are thoroughly rounded, with neither taking all the blame for their relationship's trials and tribulations - a rarity for directorial confessionals - and they're accompanied along the way by a dynamite soundtrack."
"mgswimstar2","8","1","1","16 January 2012"," Original and realistic - Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines
","This movie did not turn out the way I expected it to. The main characters did not end up together, despite popular movie ending-belief. And the movie was built on the idea of love and learning and pain - rather than being solely about love. It was deeper, and although funny at times, sad in other ways. Told in out-of-sequence events, the story of a relationship, although not one meant to be, was poignant and realistic, and ended in many lessons learned, for both the people involved and the viewers. The storyline followed Tom's life in the moments before and after he meets Summer Finn, whom he falls hard for. The events accurately depict the way Summer impacted his thoughts, his feelings, his every action, in almost an unhealthy way. Summer seemed kind of cold at times, but was realistic, and the chemistry between them was definitely tangible. They are almost perfect together - key word, almost. Tom is at believe in true love, destiny, fate, all that. But cynical Summer is a doubter, especially after her parents' divorce when she was young. Through their journey, Summer's point of view opens Tom's eyes and the movie certainly does not shy from showcasing both the ups and the downs of the relationship. Very good. A must-see."
"aelaycock","8","1","1","12 January 2012"," Quirky but enjoyable
","If you like romantic comedies, this is an unusual take on standard themes. It employs jumbled-up flashbacks, along with many other techniques, to describe the ups and downs of a young man's 500-day love affair with a girl. It quickly becomes apparent that he is head-over-heels, but she is somewhat cool and unwilling to commit herself to a full-on relationship, though she also likes him a lot. She is quite selfish really. Much of the movie's charm comes from the contrast between his puppy-dog eagerness, and her enigmatic aloofness. She is brilliantly played by Zooey Deschamel, I defy any guy not to fall in love with this girl. The male character played by Joeseph Gordon Levitt (3rd rock from the sun), has to endure a lot of frustration and sadness; however the film never loses its light, playful, upbeat character."

I could not even truly classify this as a said ""chick flick"" because of just how great this movie was. Not only does it move you emotionally, even as a guy, but it adds in much of the aspects that normal ""chick flicks"" do not; mainly comedy and a good story. I would highly recommend this film, not only for its tremendous performances by its actors, but by the sheer emotional power of its story and that it is by far one of the Top 10 Movies of 2009 by far and everyone should make an effort so view this film."

Summer sees Tom being brave for her but not for himself (work)....<br/><br/>For the most part the gender roles are reversed here with the female being the strong one and the male being lead on a leash. With the exception being Summer's honestly, and Tom's vanity (once she knows me her mind will change). <br/><br/>Tom never does anything wrong, like a lot of us, however he lacks that wow factor and by being more into her than she is to him the pain he feels we feel like is our own because he deserves more than he is getting (emotionally at least). Wanting someone and them wanting you is different than wanting someone and them putting up with you, which so frequently happens. The reality of this film is astounding and at a minimum at primer for life in the big city."

Tom has never had luck meeting the girl of his dreams; but uh-oh that dream comes walking into his workplace...Summer Finn(Zooey Deschanel)takes the job of executive assistant. Tom is love struck, but Summer doesn't really want a serious boyfriend. The chemistry between the two is short of adorable for one word. But sometimes love doesn't run as deep for each participant in the romance. The movie seems to flow with some eclectic sounds from such artists as The Smiths, Hall & Oates, Feist and Regina Spektor. Also in the cast(as if it matters): Matthew Gray Gubler, Clark Gregg, Rachel Boston and Minka Kelly. Deschanel is quirky, sweet and refreshing."
"tas22","10","1","1","16 March 2010"," Moving despite the flaws
","(500)Days of Summer is admittedly a slight film. But in contrast to the heavy handed, conventional, and leaden quality of most romantic comedies that inhabit the multiplex, it almost feels like a miracle. Amidst all the pop-culture glitter that surrounds the film, the protagonists ask some fairly profound questions about the nature of love and fate. It's so refreshing to see a filmmaker acknowledge that these aren't concepts that are set in stone; that most relationships don't automatically begin with a contrived meet-cute and end with a wedding. The process of love is detailed here, and the tragedy of building your love and hopes on a totally misguided foundation is rendered movingly. Tom is a person whose passions are directed at the wrong targets; clearly Summer is not in the same place he is and never will be. He is a greeting card writer, a profession trafficking in the most trite and simple emotions, instead of following his passion for architecture. Meanwhile Summer is also floating; her character is never developed and remains sketchy, but I think that this is intentional by the writers. Summer's feet never really touch the ground until she does what she thought was impossible - fall in love. From the perspective of Tom, which is really the character that we are supposed to sympathize with, Summer remains a cloudy object of desire, forever eluding definition. He never REALLY gets her, which is why they could never be together. Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel do a terrific job of interpreting the characters as they were written. They truly make you care about these people and wonder what they are doing when the movie ends. Some of the inserts and segments may be a little gimmicky, but the picture overall is really memorable. The music and cinematography are gorgeous and deserve recognition."
"michaelhennessy8","8","1","1","17 February 2010"," Self-conscious and stylistic, yet engaging, funny and fresh
","Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an unashamed romantic, yet feels unfulfilled churning out simple sentiments as a writer for a greeting card firm. One day, new co-worker Summer (Zooey Deschanel) overhears him listening to The Smiths, a band whom they share a passion for. Summer likes Tom. Tom loves Summer. Summer will never love Tom.<br/><br/>What makes this tale of unrequited love so interesting is its telling. The five hundred days of the title refer to the time-span of Tom's feelings for Summer, beginning before and continuing after their affair. The screenplay hops back and forth between various 'days', creating a clever little puzzle of the build-up and breakdown of a relationship. On 'Day 282', for example, Tom refers to a cutesy in-joke he shared with Summer at the height of their romance; she responds impassively. The scene promptly jumps back to 'Day 34' and the birth of this joke, a moment as intimate as they'd ever share. It's an interesting structural ploy, and the various contrasts and ambiguities it brings to the fore reflect Tom's post-break-up obsessive poring over his days with Summer.<br/><br/>Director Marc Webb does a fine job of keeping such an erratic structure feeling smooth, adeptly conveying exhilaration and heartache, often within a single scene. His credentials as a former music video director are evident; the film is stylistic, if not quite stylish, as Webb employs a plethora of slick visual tricks to convey the headiness and confusion of romance.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt adds a more lightweight lead to his roster of rogues. Tom is likable, if not charismatic; injured, rather than damaged. Like the film, his performance is well-pitched and endearing, but in no danger of topping his staggering work in Brick and Mysterious Skin. He invests Tom with just the right amount of vulnerability; his very slight awkwardness leavens rather than encumbers the screenplay's deconstruction of neurosis. He makes for a refreshingly believable romantic lead in the nerdy wish-fulfilment era of Cera.<br/><br/>Deschanel is similarly well-cast. She surveys everything with a detached demeanour that is at odds with her big bright eyes. The blending of her lovely features with her disaffected drawl is a potent mix, and makes Summer a devastating force for the men around her. Inverting her typecast role, it's nice to see Deschanel offering us a glimpse of the void beneath the (vaguely irritating) quirky surface.<br/><br/>While the synopsis might suggest an anti-romance movie- the film itself opens with such a claim- the bitterness, like the titular time-span, is bracketed. The film is ultimately hopeful, always entertaining and frequently funny.<br/><br/>But like every melancholic Smiths fan, one can't help but feel the urge to take it down a peg or two. The intermittent use of an unnamed narrator is jarring and superfluous, while the indie soundtrack is relentless, pervading almost every scene. 'Just because someone shares your interests, doesn't make them your soul-mate', Tom's wise-beyond-her-years younger sister intones (a cloying cliché of a character, admittedly, but her scenes make for some of the film's funniest moments). The filmmakers should take this advice, and resist the need to define their film and connect with their audience with the aid of a mix-tape.<br/><br/>Aside from these criticisms, the movie hits all the right notes- and what higher praise could be given of a romantic-comedy, the genre of comfort? It evokes effectively the turbulence of love through an engaging structure, and is anchored by another fine performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt."

","this is probably one of the most realistic love stories i have ever seen. first off, you can't help but love zooey deschanel in anything she does. especially in this movie, where she plays summer finn, a realistic woman who doesn't believe in love, who thinks believing in love is like believing in santa claus. and then there's her better half, tom hensen, who never thought he would meet ""the one"" until summer came along. <br/><br/>and the movie jumps from day one of their relationship, to the end of it. you get the idea how the movie is going to end when you walk into it, with the narrator (who sounds like freaking james earl jones for chrissake) tells you that what you're about to see isn't a love story, but a story about love. same thing? i think not. <br/><br/>the movie is essentially about unrequited love. it's about the missed opportunities. the things that don't work out. it's a comedy, but it covers all of these depressing topics. and that's what i like most about it. as described best in the showtime series weeds, a story can be intensely dramatic and depressing, but have inexplicably hilarious moments that coincide better than you would imagine. <br/><br/>it's a movie that's both emotionally devastating and hopeful. it reminds me of something of a cross between the movies eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and garden state. it's a rare film that displays completely fabulous acting, and it's not just your average love story. it doesn't have a beginning and an ending. it jumps in an indistinct order between the five hundred days of their relationship. and when their relationship is in its heyday, there's a choreographed dance sequence, not unlike the scene in the 2007 film enchanted. and it shows events in an incredibly depressing, but completely true-to-life way, where there's a split screen, one side, what's really happening in that moment, and the other side, what the character tom wanted to happen. and when we're in love, we find ourselves doing things like this. <br/><br/>so what can i say about this movie? everything is fantastic, the acting (especially the beautiful zooey deschanel), the writing, and the way the story is told, it's one of the best movies i've seen in 2009."
"Buddy-51","7","3","6","10 January 2010"," a romantic comedy that actually works
","""(500) Days of Summer"" is not the first movie to tell a love story using an unorthodox chronology - with ""Two For the Road,"" ""Betrayal"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" having done brilliant trailblazing work in this area long ago. Yet, while ""Summer"" is not quite in the same league with those three earlier masterpieces, it's certainly miles above the formulaic nonsense that too often passes for romantic comedy these days.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who in ""Mysterious Skin"" delivered one of the truly searing dramatic performances of recent times, here displays a similar adeptness at light comedy playing Tom Hansen, a greeting-card writer who falls head-over-heels in love with Summer Finn (the adorable Zooey Deschanel), a newly-hired assistant in the office.<br/><br/>While Tom is dead-set on having a meaningful, permanent relationship, Summer feels no compulsion to throw herself into any kind of long-term commitment, determined to savor the freedom that comes with being attractive and unattached in a buzzing metropolis like Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Rather than following a strictly linear chronology, the screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Mark H. Weber freely jumps around in time, a technique that allows us to observe the various stages of the couple's courtship simultaneously. But fear not, for the writers are careful to identify, through numbered title cards, which of the 500 days any particular scene is taking place on so the audience doesn't become disoriented. This ""dramatic irony"" approach of letting us in on where the relationship will eventually wind up - beyond what even the characters themselves know at the time - adds an additional layer of poignancy to the romance.<br/><br/>Astutely directed by Marc Webb, ""(500) Days of Summer"" is marked by smart writing, perceptive storytelling, charming performances, occasional flights of fancy and a rich attention to detail. And there's a scene on a park bench near the end of the movie that is absolutely heartbreaking.<br/><br/>A quick FYI: for a far more somber version of pretty much the same story, check out the equally fine ""The Hottest State"" by Ethan Hawke. Together, these two films would make for an interesting double-bill."

One little detail in the script that I found a tad too much was the fact the girl at the end is called Autumn. That was too unlikely and smacked of a too-cute-too be true finale.

","Love and romance sometimes don't turn the way one had hoped for. Tom Hansen, the young man at the center of the story warns us from the start this is not ""a love story"". His relationship with the beautiful Summer Finn, who is an assistant to his boss at a greeting card company, is told in not linear fashion, perhaps to make the viewer concentrate in the nuances of their romance.<br/><br/>Summer is a free spirited soul not into conventions. Tom is a more serious person, more grounded. The attraction between them is real, as we witness them at their happiest moments, or at other periods where they have disagreements. Summer, who obviously likes Tom, is the one that makes the initial contact after seeing him around the office. As it turns out, they both love the same kind of music, The Smiths, which she sings badly. Her favorite Beatle is Ringo Starr.<br/><br/>How could it be possible for these two not to stay together? Like in life, not everything is perfect, so Tom and Summer, who on the surface seemed to have found a common ground, end up going in different directions to our amazement.<br/><br/>This sunny comedy directed by Marc Webb is one of the best reasons for escaping the summer heat to be in good company. Mr. Webb story works differently than many of this genre by presenting the material in a whimsical fashion and not falling into the pattern most other romances take to be on the safe side. Mr. Webb had a good screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber who give the film a light touch for the viewer's enjoyment.<br/><br/>The pairing of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who usually can be seen in more serious work, and Zooey Deschanel, paid off well. Their chemistry as the lovers at the middle of this tale is amazing because each complements the other big time."

","I'm 60, so I've had some experiences and seen some movies, and I think that this is the first film (that my old brain still remembers)to truly depict what it feels like to be in love, particularly when the feelings are unequal! Despite the humor of many scenes, the emotions expressed were very realistic. The scene with the dancing, etc., in the park? Yes, that IS what it feels like! Fate or chance? I still don't know, and this movie doesn't give the answer, just poses the question. Why did his little sister give him the best advice ( that was a bit exaggerated...)? Perhaps because she has yet to be influences by those greeting cards and romantic movies! In any case, if you haven't been in love yet, go to see this movie to get an idea of what might be in store for you.

(500) days of Summer, like Love actually, is funny, romantic, sad,and other things. Another thing that the two films have in common are that they are both fantastic.<br/><br/>The film revolves around a guy named Tom(played excellently by Joseph Gordon-Levitt),a greeting card writer who is very deep when it comes top true love and stuff. Tom's life changes when he meets Summer Finn(played excellently by Zooey Deschanel), his bosses assistant. Deschanel isn't her normal self here. I love her in anything she's in, but here she is corky and different than usual. <br/><br/>The film shows Tom and Summer and all of the 500 days that he spent with her. These time periods jump around a bit. One minute you are on day 108 and the next 7. I wouldn't think that it would show you all 500 days. It shows you the important ones. <br/><br/>(500) days of Summer has some moments where you don't know if it's fictional or not. There are also many hilarious moments. Also some very sad moments. (500) days of Summer has many things. It's a unique romantic comedy to be perfectly honest. There is a moment where it shows what Tom wants to happen and it shows what is actually happening in the same scene. <br/><br/>Both performances are fantastic. Especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt's. This is a believable romantic comedy too. You can actually tell that Tom is in love with her. These two performances are one of the top performances of the year, and this is one of the top three movies of the year.<br/><br/>(500) days of Summer:****/****"
"Red-125","6","3","7","1 September 2009"," What movie did everyone else see?
","(500) Days of Summer (2009), directed by Marc Webb, is riding a wave of viewer adoration. Right now, it's listed in the IMDb top 250 films of all time (113th). All I can assume is that the people who gave the film a 9 or a 10 saw a different movie from the one I viewed in Rochester's Little Theatre.<br/><br/>What I saw is a man, Tom Hansen, portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is madly, truly in love with Summer Finn, played by Zooey Deschanel. OK--Deschanel has big, beautiful blue eyes, and lustrous dark hair. Right--very attractive. Is she intelligent? Not very. Is she kind and caring? Not very. Is she compassionate? Not very. Is she attracted to Tom? Not very.<br/><br/>So, we're subjected to 90 minutes of Summer jumping into bed with Tom, all the while telling him that she just wants to be good friends. I guess that's sort of romantic, and it's sort of funny, so technically that makes 500 Days a romantic comedy. It's just not very romantic or very funny.<br/><br/>In addition, just to bring the hilarity to a boil, we get Tom's friends, who are a Greek chorus of losers, and Tom's precocious kid sister, who dispenses worldly wisdom in spare moments while she's playing for her junior varsity soccer team.<br/><br/>My suggestion--if you want a really good romantic comedy, rent ""Must Like Dogs,"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle."" If you like funny, romantic movies, stay away from ""500 Days of Summer."" (At least, stay away from the version of the movie that I saw in Rochester.)"

"apiram","3","2","4","28 August 2014"," The female lead repeatedly said that she was not interested...did the dude listen? No... plain stupid and unbelievable.
","This movie must be one of THE most awful movies that I have seen. Sometimes I wonder, are critics delusional and try to find depth and complexity in a shallow plot accompanied with equally irritating characters. <br/><br/>The female lead was an obnoxious and stupid character in all rights. She was a parasite who gave the wrong signals to the thick brained protagonist, subduing him to gratify her body... He made the mistake of thinking there was more to his petty superficial relationship than meets the eye. However, on numerous occasions, she warned him that she desired NOTHING more than a casual relationship. Was the guy just stupid on an astronomical level? It was plain obvious that the female protagonist was incompatible. What is more irritating is the fact that the she in the end breaks up with her new (""proper"") partner which goes to show that she will always remain an incompatible person unable to maintain any ""proper"" affectionate relationship. She was seriously irritating and obnoxious till the very end.<br/><br/>It would have made greater intuitive sense if the girl was not portrayed as a licentious airhead (sorry for the slang) but as a normal average person. If the relationship between the two main characters were developed normally and later incompatibilities in tastes were revealed leading to disputes, it would have made more sense. If for example the male protagonist or female lead attempted to salvage a relationship that was transparent and clear in beginning but was beginning to crumble, the movie would have been better.However, this movie has this theme completely jumbled up as there is an incompatible ""relationship"" from the very start which was emphasised throughout the movie. The protagonist must have had a defect cerebral cortex... Had the female protagonist never warned him about her intended relationship, we could have forgiven the man for falling for her false signals... this was not the case.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the editing of this movie was really good. The calendar style progression of their lives. The expectation and reality dichotomy scene was also done fairly well. <br/><br/>I digress with my rant...<br/><br/>Did we even care for the female lead? No... shallow shallow shallow... I wish I could have unwatched this horrid movie that aimed to tell us ""sometimes it's not meant to be"" and there will ""always be someone for you""... This message fails because the guy was told, time and again ""it was not meant to be"" and that she was not the ""one"". Big actors in a terribly confused story. <br/><br/>Kudos for stirring up my hatred towards the female protagonist. If that was the intention, the movie executed it flawlessly. <br/><br/>To sum this movie up: thick brained man falls in love with shallow woman who warns him that she desires no real relationship on several occasions, but silly man dismisses it and gets disappointed...and wonders why... he tries to salvage the illusory relationship and remains optimistic unbeknownst to him that his ""partner"" does frankly not care and in the end... you guessed it... becomes disappointed.<br/><br/>The critics read too much into this superficial movie. It was not even worth denigration. Mind numbingly stupid."
"parkerwellman","5","2","4","7 April 2014"," This is not a love story.
","Okay, so after rewatching this movie for the second time, I have finally came to a verdict. I didn't like it. Sure it is a ""feel good"" movie, in which was what the director was going for...<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is, at the end he is told to ""Look at the negatives when reflecting on the relationship, not the positives."" To the best of my knowledge, THIS IS NOT PORTRAYED IN THE RELATIONSHIP AT ALL THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE. They go to the movies often, cry together, SLEEP together. The only negative I recall is the fight scene after the bar fight.<br/><br/>It personally frustrates me that the writer thought it was acceptable to make Joseph Gordon Levitt suffer and go through hell for this girl, while calling this movie a damn ""love"" story. It is a movie about heartbreaks and the reality of relationships.<br/><br/>He then meets Autumn after a very depressing couple of hundred days (?!?!) and it restarts. I do not know if a sequel was planned or if they were to go back into depth with Summer, it was a terrible ending. 5/10. Worth a watch. Not sure how it won so many awards when going back to the basics of it, it is suppose to be a love story (which it is not)"
"WHYeat","10","2","4","16 April 2010"," Bro-Approved thanks for a GOOD chick flick
","As a movie reviewer I'm very biased in the romantic comedy genre. I give most of them an eye-roll at best. Maybe a light chuckle. But instead of invalidating my reviews of romantic comedies, I'd like to propose that it makes a positive review that much more genuine. It also makes it many times more satisfying to find a truly good one, and that's what 500 Days of Summer is. It is an excellent romantic comedy because it balances all aspects of the genre beautifully. There's romance. That's a given. It's comedic, but not the 'somehow they're both naked and for reason don't realize it but they're about to collide and land on one another and for some reason they're all wet' kind of comedy. No. Take that corny stuff away and keep the cheesiness. The comedy is offbeat and witty and never goes astray.<br/><br/>Best of all is the story. It's completely relatable. Who hasn't had a case of the butterflies when a new love enters your life and you are hopelessly hypnotized by your own infatuation? You are on the highest of highs only to to fall to the lowest of lows when the definitions of ""couple"", ""dating"", and ""love"" complicate things. The relationship isn't perfect. ""Is this really how 'love' should be?"" you ask yourself. I've gone through all this myself, so 500 Days of Summer really resonated with me. The movie's tagline says it all:<br/><br/>This is not a love story. This is a story about love.<br/><br/>This is a story about a boy named Tom who falls in love with Summer, a girl who doesn't believe in love. He's the hopeless romantic who writes greeting cards and she's the new girl at work. Summer is aloof and uninterested in Tom at first, but when she learns about his feelings for her through their coworker, McKenzie, she kisses Tom. Not exactly out of reciprocation, but out of whimsical curiosity.<br/><br/>What followed was bliss. The highest of highs. They fall in love, or so Tom thinks, and it culminates in sex and a subsequent dance number as Tom walks to work the next morning. All the pedestrians jump in as back-up. Even a cartoon bird comes in the mix. This dance number was a nice touch since it's comedic value contrasted with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>But not even ""love"" can violate the laws of the universe. What goes up, must come down. Tom falls to the lowest of lows when he questions where he and Summer are in their relationship. She's not one to be tied down, so she takes off like the free bird she is. Then there was despair. Tom has lost the girl destined for him. He falls in a downward spiral of alcohol and cynicism.<br/><br/>However, seasons change. Autumn. Winter. Spring. Eventually, Summer returns, but now she's engaged and Tom is confused. How can Summer out of all people get married? And so suddenly? She just happened to meet a guy who was right for her, and she saw all the wonderful things about love that Tom has always believed. She explains:<br/><br/>Summer: Well, you know, I guess it's 'cause I was sitting in a deli and reading Dorian Gray and a guy comes up to me and asks me about it and now he's my husband.<br/><br/>Tom: Yeah. And so?<br/><br/>Summer: So, what if I'd gone to the movies? What if I had gone somewhere else for lunch? What if I'd gotten there 10 minutes later? It was – it was meant to be. And I just kept thinking Tom was right.<br/><br/>Tom: *in slight disbelief* No.<br/><br/>Summer: Yeah, I did. *laughs* I did. It just wasn't me that you were right about.<br/><br/>Movies, TV, and music has all brainwashed us into thinking that love is perfect, pure, and simple. And if that wasn't bad enough, they even suggest it is somehow easy to obtain. No. That's bull. It's a lot more complicated than that and it requires a lot more work than we are led to think. Enter 500 Days of Summer. This is a romantic comedy that is telling us just that. It is doing a public service to the love-struck youth by striking them upside the head with some reality.<br/><br/>Tom writes Hallmark style cards for a living. They all contain those cookie-cutter, idealistic ""I love you"" messages that are so fake. He eventually breaks free to pursue his true passion, architecture. This is also about the time when he breaks free from his false preconceptions about love and finally gets over Summer. Love is complicated, and for a romantic comedy to convey this message so poetically is commendable. Bravo and a big thanks.<br/><br/>PENIS!<br/><br/>Follow my reviews at RatedChick.com"

","I can't describe how much I enjoyed this movie. It's the perfect story adapted to the new millennium exigences that truly displays the reality in relationships.<br/><br/>The movie delivers great quotes for all tastes. The sense of humor is also available for everyone. We get intense dialog dealing with relationships, commitment, labor life, and more. The narrative is pretty original and is very detailed to the point that you get to know the main characters quickly.<br/><br/>The truth is that ""500 Days of Summer"" expresses brilliantly the truth about romantic relationships and dealing with breaking up. It's a real and funny manner to display some situations and words that sometimes are difficult to express.<br/><br/>Some memorable scenes include a musical number by Tom, the heart breaking last conversation between Summer and Tom, their train travel, Summer's party, the Autumn scene, Tom remembering the ups and cons of Summer, the karaoke moments, and more. This is a very complete film in all the sense of the word. It's the romantic comedy by excellence of the new millennium.<br/><br/>The acting is pure brilliance. Zooey Deschanel's performance is dynamic, fresh, sexy, colorful, and intense. She adds a bit of indie to her acting and I enjoyed it all the time. Plus she's just extremely beautiful to be true. I love her. Joseph Gordon Levitt steals the show. The guy is funny, and knows how to perform when he has to demonstrate pain, happiness, and more situations. The supporting cast is perfect and does it's work pretty well.<br/><br/>The Direction by Mark Webb is simply stunning. The man makes the movie look dynamic and stylish at the same time. It has a feeling of indie through all the time. The Art Direction is simply great! I loved every bit of the use of colors on important scenes. Everything looks taken out from a book!"

I would be curious if there are any other Woody fans who think the same. The friends counseling the main character, from Annie Hall. The addressing the audience, also from Annie Hall. The scene of them sitting on the park bench, from Manhattan. The ending from Annie Hall. Nice dialog throughout. Great soundtrack."

","I missed ""(500) Days of Summer"" earlier this year at Sundance (it was one of several 2nd choices for me), but thankfully I just got the chance to see it as it finally came out in my town.<br/><br/>Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) are a lot like Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) from ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", and the object of Tom's desire has a lot in common with the mother of modern complicated muses, Annie Hall (Diane Keaton in one of Woody Allen's masterpieces, if for some reason you haven't seen it yet). You can say, then, why bother seeing this? It's been done before...<br/><br/>Not exactly. Love and relationships are eternally confusing themes, and ""(500) Days of Summer"" manages to be fresh and witty enough to deserve your time. Reasons: Newcomer Marc Webb (who was a post-production assistant in 1996's documentary about grunge music ""Hype!"") shows promising talent behind the camera; the script, by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, is sharp, honest and hilarious; and, last but not least, the wonderful chemistry between two incredibly cute figures who can also act their asses off: the versatile Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Mysterious Skin"") and the indie muse Zooey Deschanel (""All the Real Girls""). It's impossible not to fall in love with one of them, or most likely with both of them, like I did. As good as a ballad by The Smiths (the soundtrack, by the way, is terrific), ""(500) Days of Summer"" not only delivers, but exceeds expectations. Go see it, by yourself and then with someone you love. 10/10."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","2","4","6 August 2009"," An absolute gem of a movie. Hilarious and true, it should resonate with anyone.
","""This is not a love story. This is a story about love."" The following quote is too true about this film, and is the perfect description of it. ""500 Days Of Summer"" is a wonderful tale about love, loss, heartbreak, and dealing with those emotions. The story is beautifully told through one of the most original and captivating scripts of the year, and carried by the phenomenal breakout performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I don't really think I've ever seen a movie, or an actor, capture the emotions as well as this movie and its star do.<br/><br/>There's no question that this film is the breakout indie comedy of 2009, like ""In Bruges"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"", ""Juno"", and ""Sideways"" before it. But the question is, why is it that movie? Like those movies listed above, ""500 Days Of Summer"" is so realistic and true in its approach that it never feels redundant or clichéd, despite being in the most formulaic and clichéd genre of film. Whether its approach be comedic, tragic, or just all out absurd (wait for the musical number!), ""500 Days Of Summer"" hits every note with perfection, whether or not the audience will like what they see.<br/><br/>There are those who simply know Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the kid from ""Angels In the Outfield"" or ""3rd Rock From the Sun"", but from now on, this will be what he's remembered for until he tops this (which, with his talent, is definitely going to happen). Gordon-Levitt's tactful and emotional take showed me something I rarely see: the ability to connect with each audience member on a personal level. It's one of the most emotionally stirring performance I've seen in many years. Throughout the film, I knew I was watching some of the best acting of the year because I not only recognized similar events that occur throughout Tom's relationship with Summer, but I remember feeling exactly what Gordon-Levitt portrays on screen. He really is a gem of an actor that should be watched for years to come (this is of course, something I've been saying for years, (but no one seemed to listen). An Oscar nomination is not out of the question here.<br/><br/>I don't know if it was just me and my date, but Zooey Deschanel's performance, while good, seemed more like the script being tailor made to her abilities as an actress. In short, her performance was enjoyable, and at times adorable, but I've seen her do the same thing in almost every role she's played, especially in ""Elf"" and ""Yes Man"" (in fact, her take on Summer is nearly identical to her performance in ""Yes Man""). I just don't think I'm as enamored with her as everyone else, but in no way does she detract from the film at all.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only romantic comedy cliché that is present here is the strength of the supporting cast, who I loved. I couldn't get enough of Geoffrey Arend as Tom's friend McKenzie, as he delivers some of the movie's funniest moments (and trust me, there are plenty, especially in the beginning and middle). Clark Gregg hits all the right notes, while Chloe Moretz is the sometimes hilariously great voice of reason that is Tom's little sister. Cameos from Minka Kelly and Ian Reed Kesler are also very well done.<br/><br/>If I had to pick out some problems, which would be nitpicking, I'd say that the movie is really short. With a story that literally encompasses 500 days (which are conveniently all in the same season...well, I guess that's Los Angeles for you), you'd think they'd need a little more time to cover it, as the film runs under 2 hours even with previews. I also didn't necessarily like a turn the script took later in the film, but it made sense and worked in the end, so it's really a non-issue.<br/><br/>Back to the things I liked about this one. There's a great amount of laughter and smiles in this movie, despite it taking a very serious tone towards the end. My face hurt from smiling so much. I also really loved the music, whether it was the composed music or the songs used throughout. This is a very stylish movie that, like ""Juno"" and ""Garden State"" before it, should spawn a bit of a mini-cult of people emulating the style (I know I want Tom's wardrobe). It's a good natured movie that will bring out your emotions and make you think about love in general, and how you've experienced it. It really is a crowd pleaser at its core, even if it's not a typical crowd pleaser.<br/><br/>A question a lot of people might have is, ""is this a good date movie?"". The answer is yes, but only if that date is someone you genuinely care about and/or - shocker here - love. It's not something you want to take someone to unless you know them well enough to see a movie like this, because...remember, it's not a love story, it's a story about love. In fact, it may be the best romance film I've seen in many years."
"jamiemdehn","10","2","4","30 July 2009"," Love it Love it Love it!
","I love this movie for so many reasons. Where do I begin, and I'll try to keep it short...<br/><br/>First, the characters. They are just so funny and adorable. You can't help but fall in love with them (especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt, all grown up and totally swoon worthy! Wonder if he likes tall brunettes? ha ha). They are just characters that you can totally relate to in one way or another. They do normal things like go to Ikea, it's not over the top romantic cheese ball story like all of the others that have come out in recent years. It actually has story lines that mimic real life events. I must say, Tom (Joseph) stole the show! And Summer (Zoe), like always, just plain adorable. In my personal opinion, the best style in Hollywood right now! <br/><br/>Second. I love the way that this movie jumps around. It doesn't get boring at all, it is a constant look back and forward in the many stages of this ""relationship"" between the two main characters. It's just refreshing to have a movie that isn't the typical boy meets girl, boy dates girl, boy looses girl, boy gets girl back, happy ending, roll credits. It went from sad to happy, to funny to all of the in between emotions that come with a budding relationship. And in the end, even though things don't turn out how they normally do in the typical Hollywood movie, it was a fantastic ending to a real life look into the world of dating, falling in love and getting your heart broken. <br/><br/>Third. I'm going to buy it the first day it comes out on DVD!"

","As I dig into every romantic comedy ever made, I have picked out very few that are like 500 Days Of Summer. Few are like 500 Days Of Summer in few are actually good. The story is structured perfectly, going back from day 150 to day 7 too day 200 to day 3. The story starts off with greeting card writer Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, handing in an excellent performance). He believes that he will not be happy until he falls in love with his soul mate. But when Summer (Zooey Deschanel, also handing in an excellent performance) becomes the new assistant to his boss, he automatically falls for her. The only problem is that Summer does not believe in love. But in one instance, they fall in love. The difference between this romance and about 95% of the romances in other rom-coms is that this romance did not happen in the snap of a finger. They actually take their time to show how they fell in love. The supporting players such as comedian Geoffrey Arend as Tom's friend and co-worker, McKenzie, and Matthew Gray Gubler (he plays Dr. Spencer Reid on TV's Criminal Minds) as Tom's friend Paul add to the laughs and the delight. Although not quite groundbreaking, it's one of the best films of the year so far, and I highly recommend you go see it."
"jaredmobarak","9","2","4","8 July 2009"," I think you know what I need  (500) Days of Summer
","This is a story of boy meets girl and it most definitely is not a love story  in the strictest sense of the word at least. Love is a major factor in (500) Days of Summer; just not in the way you may anticipate, thinking the film a romantic comedy. Instead, the tale shows us how love, or the lack therefore, can effect two young souls, lost and alone in the world. When Tom meets Summer his life is turned around to sunshine and rainbows—a full dance number, complete with Disney-fied bluebird, expresses this fact. What he doesn't know that first day is that when she tells him she isn't looking for anything serious, she means it. Tom's journey to salvation or damnation is one through the rough and tumble world of love and he is its punching bag. But one must realize that all things happen for a reason, we all need to find that love-struck puppy to show us it exists as more than a dream and we all need to find that cynical non-believer to help build up the skin and realize life isn't perfect.<br/><br/>Tom's younger sister Rachel, played wonderfully by Chloe Moretz, is the voice of reason on all things relationship. She says the one thing that all people involved in a breakup need to hear. It wasn't always good; you can't remember the one that got away in love-rimmed glasses. You need to look again and see the bad, see the ways in which he or she let you down and realize that it wasn't meant to be. Maybe they left because what you felt wasn't in their heart and, truthfully, that is a good thing. You don't want to be in a relationship built on lies; sometimes you just aren't meant to be together. So many lines in this film resonate as nuggets of wisdom so true, yet ignored when it is you those words are trying to hit. Tom asks Summer what went wrong with all her previous boyfriends and she responds with, ""What always happens? Life"". It isn't always written in stone, nor is anything permanent. Each one of us needs to work as hard as he can to keep a relationship alive because love is not always enough. But when you find that person you are meant to be with, ""you'll just know"". You'll see that thing that you could not find in the ones before.<br/><br/>That's enough of the pain for now, though. Despite this being a story about heartbreak and the love that caused it and that which heals it, there are a lot of laughs to go with the serious drama. What makes that drama hit so hard is not only the fact that the emotions are all laid out raw and unfiltered, but also because of the levity used to temper it all. The tone is set very early as the film begins with a disclaimer cautioning that any resemblances to real life are merely coincidental  even for the girl on whom Summer is based. This little touch, showing the audience how personal the tale is to the writers adds one more layer to its everyman disposition. We are experiencing something we have all seen in real life, whether to us or someone close—the pain of rejection, the confusion of utopia's demise. The humor is offbeat throughout and adds just the right amount of indie flair to make it endearing. How else could a full dance number work in the middle of a non-linear narrative about a breakup so devastating our lead spends almost half his 500 days without the girl, just reminiscing on what they had—or what he thought they had? And don't forget Geoffrey Arend's physical comedy, stealing scenes and standing out just as he did in Supertroopers and Garden State.<br/><br/>However, it is watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel interact as Tom and Summer that is amazing. The chemistry is there, something Gordon-Levitt said was easy due to the fact he listened to her album with M.Ward—making up the duo She and Him—each morning. Having been love interests in the fantastic film Manic, although under very different circumstances in that heavy drama, surely helped too. Their rapport is honest and relatable; watching them have fun in Ikea, making it their own personal playhouse, is great. Comedic timing precise and possibly ad-libbed, lines like ""honey, don't look now but a Chinese family is in our bathroom"" land direct hits. But those moments aren't only utilized for laughs; they also show the symmetry of life by using the line as an example of bliss for day 38, but also of distance and disinterest come day 191. Life definitely happens to this couple, making them stronger even if a year of pain and weakness is necessary to acquire that strength.<br/><br/>Told out of order, we experience the 500 days of the title just as the writers want us to. Days are coupled to mirror each other for greater emotive force, they are shown in sequence quickly as a humorous device expressing days spent in bed depressed, and they are paired to prove how fickle dating is as one day Tom is in love and the next they are through, even though they never were a they to that point. Kudos to director Marc Webb for going all out: getting stellar performances from his cast and infusing unique style, a rockin' soundtrack, and even moments of animated sketches. Rarely can you put life in all its glorious blemishes and bruises on screen without the need to tack on a happy ending or contrived moment of explanation, sometimes there aren't any. But this is a story about a boy and girl who went through adolescence listening to sad, melancholy Brit-pop. We're lucky these kids aren't Goths as a result, just two souls looking for answers, unsure if the other can supply them."

","500 Days of Summer looks at the Relationship of Tom and Summer in a different way than most movies in this genre. From the Beginning you can relate to the main charakter Tom, because of the very good performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt who carries the movie with his great performance. Unfortunatley Zoey Deschanel was not very convincing and therefore the whole chemistry between the main charakters did not always feel very real. Nonetheless the movie did a great job creating emotions. Happy moments were portrayed really well and also sad moments had their one tone and did create the perfect feeling for this moment in the movie. After a while the movie becomes slightly predictable and a bit too overdramatic but still feels very lighthearthed and caring. The ending was sweet and leaves the viewer with mixed feelings. In my opinion the ending was a bit too formulated, but still did deliever the right emotions that were needed in this moment.
Overall 500 Days of Summer is a good movie with some interesting plot elements. The emotions in the movie felt real and consume the viewer from the very first shot. Sometimes it follows to much the formula of a normal romantic Comedy and therefore becomes nothing special in the end. 7/10"

","I'll be the first to admit that I'm biased when it comes to this film. In 2009, I experienced my first ever relationship. I also experienced a breakup from said relationship in the same year. Consequently, I can relate to the main character, Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and his rise and fall brought about by Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Like Tom, I too held the romantic belief of ""the one,"" based mostly on the movies, books, TV shows, and music that touted this magical someone who would fill the hole in our souls. What (500) Days of Summer emphasizes is certainly closer to reality: not every story has a happy ending.<br/><br/>As for the way the movie is presented, I must applaud the ingenious and artful direction of Marc Webb, this being his directorial debut after years of working on music videos. His previous experience certainly comes through in the music chosen for the film, as well as some of the cinematography to go along with said music. Jumping around the timeline of the 500 days, this film's fractured storyline helps to show the contrast between the ""honeymoon phase"" and the downward spiral that leads to a breakup.<br/><br/>My favorite sequence in the film was the ""Expectation/Reality"" split screen since it was by far the most accurate representation of many of my personal experiences. As a male, I know women can be confusing, but the ambiguity of the relationship in this movie made the vagueness of Summer especially heartbreaking for Tom. Watching this movie again, years later, I appreciated how the personal growth and moment of courage for Tom were the positive results of his failed relationship. The fact that relationships don't turn out the way we think is probably why I also truly enjoyed La La Land (2016) as well.<br/><br/>An adorable film with some valid points about relationships, I give (500) Days of Summer 5.0 stars out of 5."

","""There are two kinds of people in this world: men and women"". Aside from heavy-handed heterosexual lines of dialogue (like the above) in an attempt to come across as quirky, this romance often recycles classic love story traits and turns the story into a realistic relationship that questions fate and determinism. Many believe there is a soulmate out there in the big world for us, just waiting to be discovered. Is it fate? Or pure coincidence when we find love? Thomas, a writer for a card company, encounters the wonderfully sweet Summer. He helplessly falls in love and must soon deal with the aftermath of their ""break up"".<br/><br/>Using the guy's perspective is an interesting viewpoint, and portrays the idea that anyone regardless of gender can overanalyse a situation and suffer the same heartbreak. Director Webb captures the typical tropes that swamp the rom-com genre, such as happily dancing along the street to upbeat acoustic tracks, but turns them into self-referential devices to highlight the implausibility of true love. The use of on-screen graphics to indicate the narrative time shifts enhance the quirkiness of the film. It works well! Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are cute together, even if the latter lacks the acting talent of the former. Yet they still emit a sense a humanity that makes them relatable as characters.<br/><br/>The fleeting romance between them is perhaps underdeveloped in certain areas, and that's partially due to the tight runtime that prevents further exploration into their adorable love. I mean look at him! He is always so smitten and happy. Just want to pinch his cheeks! I appreciate the realistic conclusion, and to be honest, Autumn looks like a catch so it works in his favour. Overall, a refreshing spin on the formulaic rom-com genre that really should've been ""(1000) Days of Summer""."

","This is a very good film. The acting is superb, especially from Joseph Gordon Levit and Zooey Deschanel. The direction is very tight, and the script is the reason the film is rated an 8.

I loved the serious art house satires of Bergman films and the idolatry of The Graduate. I also like the sequence where several of the physical aspects of Summer that he liked, now annoy him to no end. That is so true in real life. What Joe needed to learn is that women are like buses; there'll be another one in fifteen minutes. Maybe not THE ONE, but at least a decent replacement chair for your broken lazyboy.

","In the drama and romance movie 500 Days of Summer, the idea of fate is communicated throughout the film. The stars of the movie Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt, show the struggles of love in the 21st century. The portrayal of lost and gained feelings gives insight to how often we in real life face challenges with love.
 Throughout the movie the characters Summer Finn and Tom Hansen are in constant uncertainty with their love for one another. Tom is a hopeless romantic and a firm believer in love at first sight, he feels this instantly when he meets Summer. However Summer thinks otherwise, she informs Tom that there is no such thing as love and that it is a fantasy. Nonetheless Tom continues to pursue Summer and falls even deeper in love as they go into a dating phase. What Tom doesn't realize is that Summer doesn't love him the way he loves her, and she communicates to him multiple times that they are just friends. Tom doesn't take this rejection well and becomes depressed, leaving him to believe that Summer was right, that nothing means anything and love is just a fantasy.
 Tom once said before Summer broke his heart, ""I love her, I love the sound of her laugh, I love her cute knees, I love this heart shaped birthmark she has, and I love the song I hear when I'm with her."" After his brutal break up, so to speak with her he repeats, ""I hate Summer, I hate her hair, I hate her cackling laugh, I hate her knobby knees, I hate that splotch she calls a birthmark, and I hate this song!""
 A few months later Summer invites Tom over to her place for a party and Tom's expectations exceed reality. At the party he comes to discover that Summer, whom he still loves, had recently become engaged. This breaks him down for months, until he finally gets up, quits his job, and goes on to find his passion in life. More months pass and Tom runs into Summer again, and she tells him that he was right all along about love and that it does exist. This leaves Tom bewildered and somewhat satisfied. Later that day Tom meets another woman named Autumn.
 I enjoyed this movie because it explained the ups and downs of love and the very realness of fate. I also enjoyed the actors in the film, Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt, and how they conveyed the lack of love in their relationship. Tom and Summer weren't meant for eachother, they were destined to meet new people to fall in love with. Which Summer had already done and now its Tom's turn. The film shows that just because love fails once doesn't mean it always will."

","As the narrator tells the audience, this is a story about boy meets girl. But you are mistaken if you think this is a story about love. Now we all know the rom-com formula, so say it with me: Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl breaks up with boy, boy and girl make up. Yay. Happy ending. And you find these aspects in (500) Days of Summer, and it certainly does fall under this category, but if I were ever to suggest a rom-com to one of my fellow brethrens, this would be the one (well, maybe Midnight in Paris, but that's not truly a rom-com either). The point is that if you didn't know better, a quick check on IMDB for a summary of the film would make it sound forgettable, but I am here to tell you that there is a bunch worth watching.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right from the start the film sets the quirkier tone of the humor to play out. And not only is it pretty darn rootin' tootin' funny to me, but the overall clever framework and setups have a broad paint stroke on who it will appeal to. To get the basis down, the film jumps back and forth through the 500 days, and it quickly shows the breakup around day 290. Well, if it just skipped to step #3 of the 4 in rom-coms, why should we bother watching the entire film?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now I could be cheesy and say, ""Oh, but the story of how they fell in love is worth the watch!"" Now that wouldn't want you to watch it, me to watch it, or really anybody who has a better way to spend an hour and a half. Luckily, as the narrator suggested, that's not the point of the film. Yes there's solid chemistry between Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel (even if she plays the same carefree, do whatever she wants type of girl in every film), but really the money hits the mark in a couple of standout scenes. I'm talking about the dance number and the expectations vs. reality. And you may have no idea what I'm referring to if you haven't watched the film, and that's okay. All I'm trying to say is that there is actually a script here that takes a story told a thousand times and projects it in multiple appealing ways.<br/><br/><br/><br/>From beginning till end, you will be watching the film happily instead of either taking a nap and pretending to have cared about the past hour or preparing the tissues and triple chocolate ice cream. It's an enjoyable film with a good soundtrack-- not much more you can ask.

","500 Days of Summer is a brilliantly crafted film that captures attention and tugs on heartstrings in a unique way. My initial reaction to the movie was two thumbs up due to it's aesthetically pleasing nature and intricate story line, I would absolutely recommend this movie as a fun movie to watch that still has meaning behind it. 
A principle part of the movie is the nonconventional sequence it follows. It jumps around from different points in their relationship so the viewer doesn't watch their relationship from start to finish but rather a scatter of events from it. Also, the narrator states in the beginning of the movie, ""this is not a love story"". This creative production of the movie is what differentiates it from conventional movies about relationships.
The next interesting aspect of the movie is the colors it uses. Tom is primarily brown, Summer is primarily blue. The viewer can tell the intensity of their relationship at the time by the color of their clothes or the color of the room or scene around them. It also shows how incompatible Tom and Summer really are. They are two different people based on their colors. Therefore, they spend a bit of the movie trying to force themselves to be someone they aren't, which is why they don't end up together.
The reason I truly loved the movie was the characters, Tom is a stubborn man who tries to shape the world around him to his liking. Summer is emotionally unavailable. Watching these two interact is oddly intriguing, watching them fall out of love makes sense. I still somehow was left thinking they might work out. 
The movie is similar to Hero (2002) directed by Zhang Yimou. This movie paints each scene with a different color. This helps the viewer understand the emotions of the film through visual clues. It's a very beautiful way to convey emotion. 
 The movie projects the idea that trying to be someone you're not and trying to be with someone you're not meant to be with leads to unhappiness. This very real message portrayed in an interesting way makes the movie an overall great watch."

It's mainly about love and all phases of relationships with all its ups and downs and in such a stunning detail starting from the secret crush to honeymoon phase until reality catches up. It's about true love, and how unexpected and random it is, it can never be planned it just happens. That's why it touched me on a personal level if a relationship is over it means it wasn't the right one yet the most important thing is moving on and focusing on oneself and love will come at the right time without rush and that's what happened to Tom."

Despite its patchy stroytelling, the cohesion is not compromised. Well done..."

","Being well removed from the target audience for a film like this, I can only say I tolerated it for the purpose of posting a review, recommended as a Top 250 Movie for 2009, the year it was released. Like a lot of teenage/young adult heart throb stories, they're usually a one-shot affair as it's present rating wouldn't make the cutoff for the current year's listing. It's not that I have anything against films like this, I just find them mediocre at best with not a lot to say about anything, unless you're someone of the same age dealing with the kind of coming of age issues as Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel). I thought their portrayals were good by the way, though the way Summer came across seemed like she didn't care about herself very much the way she entered her non-relationship with Tom. And the way Tom burned his bridges at the greeting card company more than anything displayed his own immaturity. He would need a new job referral, wouldn't he? <br/><br/>The one creative effort in the picture I liked was the split screen, Expectations/Reality scenario which diverged and and then dovetailed back on itself during the party scene. The split screen technique isn't new, but I don't think I've seen it used that way before. Before seeing this movie, for the life of me I couldn't figure out how the five hundred days of summer was going to play out in the story, never thinking that it might have been a character's name. But at the finale, I had a pretty good idea what the new girl's name would be, because after all, what comes after summer. In Tom's case, we'll never know if he found true happiness with Autumn, or if he was headed for a big fall."
"GrungeFan1996","10","0","0","17 March 2017"," Our expectations hardly ever meet reality
","At the very beginning of the film, the narrator states, ""this is not a love story"", and he is right. 500 Days of Summer, while it may have been marketed as a romantic comedy when it was first released back in '09, it is not, it is a coming of age story about naivety and expectations. In the film, we follow Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a very naive young man who has a crush on his co-worker Summer (Zooey Deschanel), a young woman who likes him, but doesn't really have the same feelings for him as he does for her, and when he figures that out, he goes into a serious depression. What I like most about this film is how realistic it is, and having been in a similar situation as Tom, I was easily able to relate. The film shows what can happen to our emotional health if we let our expectations get too high without thinking of what the reality of the situation could possibly turn out as when dealing with a crush. The film is very funny yet very depressing at the same time. The acting is fantastic, Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers one of the, if not the most convincing performance of his acting career. 500 Days of Summer is a film I encourage all young people who have yet to start dating to watch because it teaches these lessons: don't get overly attached to someone you don't know very well, and when dealing with a crush, try to keep your expectations relatively low, or else you will end up feeling depressed, hurt, unworthy, hopeless, etc. because most of the time when we have a crush on someone, our crush most likely won't fall for us in the end. Depressing? Yes, but very true. It's very rare for me to give a movie a 10/10, but I feel that this film really deserves it, I think it's a masterpiece!"

","500 Days of Summer follow Tom, who falls for the newly moved in Summer, and how their relationship develops over the course of 500 days. <br/><br/>The movie swaps between days, showing one of the later days of their relationship, then switching back to one of the earlier ones. So the audience is almost always anticipating what will happen next, and yet somehow that works really well. We see aspects of their relationship when they were good, then when they were bad, then somewhere in between. For the most part it goes chronologically, but other events are emphasized by switching between parts of their relationship, thus giving the audience a full view of how it all went down. <br/><br/>The relationship itself is fun and authentic, and a lot of the movie is fantastical, meant to be taken with a grain of salt. It adds a level of humor to the movie, and it is, in the end, very funny. It uses these fantasy sequences to emphasize certain feelings, and it's kind of hilarious yet very real. When the things in this movie take place and it takes an unrealistic path, it's not hard to believe that the characters really feel like what is happening would be happening. <br/><br/>The two major characters are both a lot of fun, and they have pretty good chemistry together. No, their chemistry isn't perfect, but that's part of the authenticity of them. Their dialogue is written in such a way where humor flows into the script and is often clever, whereas in a lot of other comedies jokes are just forced in. It never sacrifices it's script for laughs, and I really appreciated that. But they're aren't just hilarious, they're realistic. They say and do things that would otherwise be self-incriminating in a relationship like there's, showing how flawed both of them are. There is no real good guy, no one to root for all the way, right to the end of it's reasonably short run time. <br/><br/>One of the best aspects of this movie is the soundtrack. Every song is lovely to listen to and fits the current setting or mood of the film. Plus the songs are all just good songs. I've listened to the soundtrack several times already, and I can't wait to do so again. <br/><br/>The movie is, not only great on the technical spectrum, but also in the emotional spectrum. The third act throws so much at the audience that it makes them want to cry. And yet, these twists and turns are easily believable as possible events that could happen in real life, which I think makes it slightly more tear-jerking. <br/><br/>Overall 500 Days of Summer is a fantastic movie. It's filled with great characters, writing, humor, music, emotion, and realism. There are a handful of small nitpicks I have with it. Little scenes that maybe don't work as well as they could have, but are easy to brush off. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie."

","There are a lot of reviews here that summarize this romantic comedy- drama film that talks about a ""boy that meets a girl"". Many described the nonlinear style of narration in this movie where the plot goes back and forth without following the chronological order of the events.. the chemistry within the movie.. the reality in which it deals with romantic relationships.. heartbreaks and tender moments.. the life stages Tom goes through from ""summer to autumn"" and the messages the movie is trying to deliver..<br/><br/>Yet there is an important idea that I didn't observe in the reviews I read and that's what made me write this review.. I think this idea is one of the most significant ideas the movie is trying to communicate with us.. ""Fate"". <br/><br/>Yes the movie is trying to say that not every person you meet is ""the one and only"" not even if you share a lot with him/her.. not even if you fall in love! Yes the movie is trying to say that life will always provide you with opportunities for you to be happy.. that you shouldn't fall back because of a bad experience and that you shouldn't lose faith.. that you should work hard and never give up your dreams.. but the movie is also trying to say, especially in the last couple of scenes, that life is meaningful and the world we live in is not just a number of coincidences. Things happen for a reason and whether it is in a sense ""good or bad"" we can always make the best of it and benefit from the experience.. and there truly you will be content with the fate life has favored you."

","My initial reaction after finishing this is ""Wow! How charming!"" That kind of sums up my overall feeling about 500 DAYS OF SUMMER, although the narrative turns take you through a much wider range of emotion. The basic plot is of the ""boy meets girl"" variety, with the ""boy"" being played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the ""girl,"" Zooey Deschanel. However, this is not your typical romantic film. Zooey Deschanel is the ""Summer"" of the title, and the story hops backwards and forwards through Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer's 500 day relationship. For starters, the broken-up chronology, although somewhat of a cliché at this point, was useful insofar as it withheld plot secrets until the right moment, regulating the stream of information toward the viewer and maintaining interest. Of course, it helps that the two leads are quite likable and have pretty good chemistry together, in that awkward, post-modern way. I also thought that the message about fate/destiny being an illusory concept rather apropos in a society that has (largely) moved beyond traditional gender roles, as the film demonstrates to a high degree. In a world where those kind of barriers come down, it can be scary and more confusing, but that's often the beauty of it as well. Without things prewritten or having to conform to a set ""script,"" we are free to interpret events as we choose and mold our lives to the form we desire. The only cog in the film's machine is, unfortunately, Tom, who initially displays a dangerous level of complacency and hesitancy, which proves detrimental to his relationship with Summer. By contrast, Summer is a strong, but not invulnerable, female character. I really liked her, whereas Tom had to grow on me (development!). Overall, the film is certainly a shot in the arm to the well-worn romantic dramedy. There were some nice meta touches, i.e., a dance sequence, and a split-screen sequence which shows ""Expectation vs. Reality."" Some of the social commentary did seem a little on-the-nose, and it didn't exactly move me emotionally in the greatest way, but I laughed a lot and was constantly thinking about the message the film portrayed. So, definitely one to check out if you haven't already."

However, I think it's a human relation story after I watched it, because the ending is not love story.

","We have all been through that familiar path before. Just when we thought we found the guy/girl of our dreams and they connect with each other and have similar shares with each other and hopes that a simple platonic relationship could progressively enhance into something beyond those parameters. And then, after a while the inevitable happens and then one of them breaks up with you and it takes many frustrating leaps and bounds to ask them to take them back only to realize that they were meant to be together. Until finally we come to realize that you might succeed or might fail, but in the end the end, there's always room for hope. <br/><br/>""(500) Days of Summer"" tells a very familiar story about Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who works at a greeting card company and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) his co-worker who seems like a nice couple as they're seated on a bench with her hand on top of his complete with a beautiful ring on her finger. <br/><br/>Before you know it, as the film progresses we discover that Tom and Summer have ended their relationship and Tom has not taken this very well. While battling depression and heartbreak, Tom's friends have tried to offer him support and his lovable sister Rachel (Chloe Grace Moretz) provide reassurance as a way to prevent him from going into deeper depression for fear he might self-destruct. <br/><br/>One of the things that might get fans peeved off about this movie is the fact that it doesn't operate on a formulaic day-to-day chronological events. The narrative is quite non-linear so therefore, scenes will jump over various intervals as the film rolls. Just remember you've been warned. We know that they're co- workers at the greeting card company. They have a few drinks, get wild at a karaoke party and Summer seems to be attracted to his enthusiasm even though she has really no intentions of hooking up with anyone. All the while Tom pretends like he's not interested in her either for the fear of doing something embarrassing or stupid or something he might regret. And who has never done that before?<br/><br/>The triumphs and setbacks in Tom and Summer's relationship is the cornerstone of what the entire movie is about. We know that Summer has been turned off by Tom for some time and the quirky charm that once attracted Summer has fizzled out like a flower in late August. We see Tom looking back the magical time when they first met. But he still can't get over the fact that she never intended their relationship to be anything more than just friends. <br/><br/>The performances were all very good, even though there really isn't any top quality A-list performers, but they're all bright and likable and we truly care about each character. Joseph Gordon-Levitt shows just how versatile he is as a performer and really has come on his own from his early days in misunderstood movies like the ""The Juror"" to his comedy roots on ""Third Rock From the Sun"". Zooey Deschanel can always tempt you with her sparkly cuteness while embodying her independence as Summer. <br/><br/>I also though that by making the story non-linear was clever on the part of director Marc Webb which adds a dimension of freshness by preventing this story from becoming wanton. That way we can keep guessing if Tom will ever win back Summer's heart. And while keeping it real, while maintaining the humour fresh, and the overwhelming roller coaster of events might not please everyone but the realism behind it is purely justified. In the unpredictable world we live in they say there is someone for everyone, but we don't know exactly how and were Tom and Summer meant to be together? Even Tom himself doesn't really know. <br/><br/>What really stands out about this movie is the amazing music score by Mychael Danna and Rob Simonsen. It's filled with some wonderful tracks from well established artists like The Smiths, Wolfmother, Rebecca Spektor, Simon and Garfunkel, Hall and Oates among others that are light for a romantic comedy, but the artists are familiar names which is good, because too many romantic comedies have musician we never heard about which makes it very annoying. <br/><br/>Overall, ""(500) Days of Summer"" was a nice little romantic comedy you could watch and get involved with the characters in it. It wasn't formulaic, sappy and didn't make you want to stab yourself with a fork. And the realism involved towards the theme that love can be unpredictable rings true. It may bring happiness, it may bring heartbreak, but either way this message is saying that even when you're down you must look for ways to get yourself back into the race."

","The word ""love"" is overused. We hear it virtually everyday. Whether it be in songs, movies, television, the internet, or cards, we are bludgeoned over the head by the media of the idea that we all must meet ""the one"". This results in people like Tom, a hopeless romantic and, naturally, a writer of those cards that you get every year on Valentines Day. He hopes to be an architect, but, judging by his belief in fate, he probably thinks that if he were good enough to be an architect, then he would be an architect. Summer, on the other hand, has hated the idea of ""love"" ever since her parents got divorced when she was a kid. She doesn't believe in love or fate, and she doesn't want to get overly attached to anyone because she now knows how things usually end up. They meet at work, and Tom thinks he is in love with her. He lists all of the things he loves about her. Wait, before I go on I should get something straight. These two people don't fall in love with each other by the end of the movie, and the movie makes this very clear, despite seemingly looking like a stereotypical love movie based on the first scene, which shows us that life isn't like the media tells us it is. The film isn't structured in a completely linear manner, and we see that in the future, things aren't perfect between them. Anyway, Summer makes it clear that she doesn't want what they have to be serious, but this is obviously a problem with Tom, despite him not saying anything about it. There is an obvious problem with this relationship from the start that neither of them address. Summer is too close minded to open herself up to a relationship, and Tom is a hopeless romantic that believes that she is ""the one"". This results in Tom losing all hope and thinking that he will never be in love again after they break up, because she was ""the one"", and it only strengthens the blow when he finds out later after running into her that Summer, the woman who never wanted a boyfriend, is now getting married. He hates her now, and the list of things that he loved about her at the beginning, is now the list of things he hates about her. When he looks back at their relationship he sees all of the bad moments. He is stuck in a rut for a little while, but his sister makes him realize that there were good times too, and he should remember all of it. He should cherish the good memories, learn from the bad ones, and move on. After Tom quit his job of making greeting cards and sulked for a while, he suddenly gets up and starts drawing on the chalkboard in the back of his room, mapping out options for an architectural job and eventually drawing a big city, filled with skyscrapers. He realized that he controls his fate, not the world. And now he is sitting on the bench that he once sat on with Summer. Suddenly he realizes Summer in the background. Tom has transformed his philosophy entirely since the beginning of the movie, saying that everything Summer used to say was right. But summer says that she now believes in love, despite being completely against the idea of it, because one day that she was with her husband she just knew that she would be with him for a long time. Something she just didn't feel with Tom. So he gets an interview for another architectural firm, after many bad ones (that we don't see). But he meets a girl in the waiting room. They talk a little, and Tom gets up to go to his interview. He suddenly turns around and asks her if she wants to go out sometime. This might seem strange and sudden, but what Summer has taught him is that some people just absolutely don't work out and won't. But sometimes, it just works, and while you shouldn't expect every girl to be the one, you might as well give it a chance, and be open minded."

","This review contains spoilers for not only 500 Days of Summer but the movies Her, and Midnight in Paris, as well. The passage with the spoilers will be in all CAPS, so if you don't want these films spoiled, avoid that section.<br/><br/>By most reviews I've seen, 500 Days of Summer is considered to be criminally underrated and deserves more attention. It happens a lot with me that a film is called underrated so many times that when I finally get to seeing it, it becomes overrated, in the case of Dredd, Edge of Tomorrow, and now 500 Days of Summer. It's a very generic film with attempts at trying to hide it. We've all seen the character types before. The antisocial male protagonist who meets the outgoing, different-from-every-other girl he falls in love with; Zooey Deschanel having gotten this character sown to a science, it being really the only character type she plays. People often say that this film is different from other romantic (comedy) films because it takes place from the perspective of the male in the relationship, but many others do that, (Her, and Midnight in Paris, for example). <br/><br/>ANOTHER ARGUMENT IS THAT THE MAIN CHARACTER AND HIS LOVE INTEREST DON'T END UP TOGETHER IN THE END. AND AGAIN, MIDNIGHT IN Paris AND HER DO THIS AS WELL, AND BETTER. MIDNIGHT IN Paris EVEN HAVING ALMOST THE EXACT SAME ENDING, IN THAT THE LEAD FINDS A DIFFERENT GIRL AND THE FILM ENDS HAPPILY WITH HIM AND HER, THAT BEING MY ONLY REAL PROBLEM WITH MIDNIGHT IN Paris.<br/><br/>The only thing about this film that I haven't seen before is the nonlinear plot, which keeps things relatively interesting, but that may have been done before, and I don't know it, as I don't seek films of this genre too often for fear of ending up with one like this. In the end, I don't think 500 Days of Summer is a bad movie, but not very good, either. It's not very original, but I can see it tried to be, and I acknowledge that. I'm giving this a positive rating, still, because of that and the fact that it was still entertaining and occasionally pretty funny."

","If you asked me what this movie was about I would be baffled at what to answer. There is a beginning, middle and end, but the film jumps around the timeline so much that it leaves you confused about what's happening and where you exactly are in the story. <br/><br/>But the biggest problem is that the movie is basically riding on Joseph Gordon-Levitt's charm. He's really good in this role which I can't say about his co-star. I found nothing likable about Zooey Deschanel's character Summer. Through out the film I struggled to understand what Tom saw in her. The movie tries to make her in this There's Something About Mary irresistible type but it really doesn't work. She's a one note character.<br/><br/>And Chloe Grace Moretz was too adult. Usually I like the mature kid character, but her Rachel felt completely unnatural. It's like the character was originally written to be ten years older.<br/><br/>With that out of the way there are a lot of good things to be said about this film. It was funny and had some meaningful things to say. The final scene with Tom and Summer was great and it brought together the film's point and illustrated it perfectly. It would have been a great ending to the film, but then it goes on and in the final scene Tom meets the girl that will, supposedly, be his one true love. The clichéd ending ruins everything the film had been building up to this point. It's just the type of Hollywoodized BS that Tom was deriding earlier in the film.<br/><br/>But overall 500 Days of Summer is a very enjoyable film. I liked it and would still recommend seeing it despite its flaws."

","I have had a few failed relationships over the course of my life; who hasn't. Amidst the anger, remorse and bad poetry the expectation of true love always remains in shambles by the end. Yet if and when we stop feeling sorry for ourselves, we get back up, we dust ourselves off and we try again. It's a hard thing to do, be we feel compelled to do so maybe because of biology, perhaps hubris or perhaps something deeper. This is the complex web of emotions (500) Days of Summer tries and largely succeeds in capturing.<br/><br/>Through the voice of an omnipotent narrator we're introduced to Tom (Gordon-Levitt), a young man who grew up on a steady diet of sad British pop music and a total mis-reading of the movie The Graduate (1967). He studied to be an architect but instead of taking a chance on a dream career he works at a greeting card company. It is there he meets Summer (Deschanel) an attractive young woman who shares his love for indie bands and other bizzaro crap; truly this must be love. Not so much however; within the first five minutes we are informed expressly (500) Days of Summer is not a love story. This may come as a surprise to Tom.<br/><br/>The movie skips around between the relationship's genesis, the honeymoon period and a possible disintegration. It's playful editing and hilarious moments of romantic realism immediately puts the audience in a trance. Through various call-backs, juxtapositions and cliché romantic comedy goofiness even the most cynical heart falls for Tom's unadulterated romanticism and Summer's quirk. Yet beneath that quirk is a cynicism we've seen before in a lot of other movies; she doesn't believe in true love and doesn't want anything too permanent so naturally we spend the entire movie waiting for her to change her mind. After all the first shot of the movie is Tom and Summer sitting on a park bench on a nice spring day, hands touching and a ring on her finger.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is a romantic comedy for the times. Occasionally silly, occasionally maudlin, the movie plays with expectations of those accustomed to genre clichés while quietly subverting them for a generation of skeptics and latch key kids. The movie insists that love isn't just boy meets girl, it's a complex set of emotions and circumstances that takes patience and understanding to master. Tom is our unwitting vessel to guide us through this rather harsh lesson and despite warning signs we're all oblivious to the true machinations of the film until the ending.<br/><br/>Yet the film isn't bitter or cynical towards the idea of love but rather cynical towards the tropes and clichés we're constantly being subjected to by popular media. In one poignant scene, Tom accuses the sentimentality behind love songs, movies, and the very cards his company makes for his relationship struggles. Though the constant callbacks to the final scene of The Graduate undercuts him a bit. Are his problems the fault of an expectation imposed on Tom or an expectation he misconstrued? What about our expectations? There seems to be a large faction of the internet that dislikes Deschanel's character because of her presumed haughtiness. And while the movie stumbles a bit in coloring in her characterization, Summer is ultimately exercising her own agency. You can't blame her for her actions when she make her intentions so clear.<br/><br/>What is abundantly clear is (500) Days of Summer is a fun, quirky, creatively inspired movie about what it means to fall in and out of love. The movie's script written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber is sharp, funny and most importantly observant and respectful of youth. We constantly forget that our understanding of love, two people getting to know each other without familial involvement, is relatively new. Popular media has had the opportunity to gestate the ""girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her"" idea since the start. Here's to hoping coming generations will be able to keep things less messy. If (500) Days of Summer is any indication, we're on the right track."

","Well, this is one of the movies that have escaped my attention for quite some time. Decided to watch it the other day and I have to say that I really have mixed feelings. <br/><br/>As far as production, direction, actors, etc, goes, the movie was great! Really liked the back and forth of the story and how the mood of the movie changed from one moment to the next. I liked the way the romance evolved and also the moments, the awkward moments of problems were depicted nicely.<br/><br/>Having said that, I really expected some more insight from the movie. It makes a specific point that everyone is bound to find someone they will love, out of luck and coincidence. And no matter how much against relationships and commitment you are, there will come someone that will sweep you off your feet. OK, got that and really agree. <br/><br/>The movie leaves destiny in the sideline and this is something I really believe also. All in all, the movie makes a valid point for relationships, and I really liked the fact that this was not yet another love story... <br/><br/>I did not appreciate the character of this weird guy that seems to have nothing going on in his life, no interest whatsoever, working in a mediocre job, making cards and being miserable about it and about everything else around him. He tries to compensate for his miserable life by falling for this amazing, full of life girl that seems to have too many things going on for her. He's desperate to cling on to her and she's clearly the joy of life that in the end, evades him to move on. She was into him for his looks, or cause sometimes girl like this are being attracted by these mysterious, weird guys, only to find out that they are being dragged in their misery in the end. <br/><br/>I think that this aspect of the movie is not pointed out enough. I mean, of course it would not work. Of course she would eventually move on. But why? How does the result relate to the initial situation? Is it her fault? And then, when he flashes back in their relationship and sees all the small moments that indicated the end, what's about that? That was completely and utterly irrelevant. These moments exist in every relationship. The signs can always be found, both the good and the bad ones. <br/><br/>I really think that this movie should have focused more on timing, compatibility of characters, life-theories, etc., to explain why some things just don't work, instead of focusing on the randomness of relationships.

On the other hand, Summer does not believe in destinies. This difference in concepts of love between Tom and Summer makes them being in a trouble.<br/><br/>The most impressing point of this movie is how opinions of people differ from each other's. It is kind of funny even though it is an ordinary fact. I have felt very sorry when Tom sings fiercely at karaoke after Summer has said something negative to Tom. I actually do not understand how Summer thinks. In my opinion, the way Tom thinks is a usual one which is same as mine. I also have felt mixed with the fact that Tom cannot express and explain his real thought to Summer and Summer does not realize his thought, too.<br/><br/>The main message of this movie, in my opinion, is that every person has different idea. This fact should be an obvious one, but many people forget about it. Sometimes you have a problem with someone because of gaps of your thinking, which cannot be ignored.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a story of a man who loves one lady. It tells the viewers to acknowledge differences in opinions between people."

","""Why?"" A simple question that my friends and acquaintances seem to always ask when I start talking to them about how amazing this movie is. The answer is simple, I believe that this movie is amazingly beautiful and relatable. It shows the ups and downs of being in love. It's aesthetically pleasing, it's light, it's quirky but not off-puttingly-weird, if this movie was a edible, it would be a macaroon. Think about it, a macaroon is sweet, light, pretty and yet, it looks weird -- I mean, seriously, what is a macaroon, is it supposed to be a mini sweet sandwich or something?<br/><br/>Aside from all of those obvious characteristics, this movie gave me one single virtue, ""Love, such as life, is not always as we plan"". Not so much to the extent as 'all-events-in-life- are-random-yet-interconnected-the-whole-Pulp-Fiction-vibe', but it gives insight to the beauty of life in itself. <br/><br/>The relationship that Summer and Tom developed was unhealthy, it was rushed, it was too much of a fantasy. Life isn't like that. I think that's what makes this film amazing, it tells us that life and our hopes and dreams don't always align. Yet, as the movie in its entirety shows, it's beautiful. Even when it's not always happy, life is beautiful. That's why this movie is amazing."

","The story is really a weird one in my view. It tells of a man who looks carefree but at then gets defeated by his obsession to this girl who had told him from the very first moment that they're not serious. It gets even weirder as the man looks to be socially acceptable to have a girl; he has a fine taste of clothing style, a steady paying job, and of course the looks; yet he is still single before he met the girl. Furthermore, he seeks advice from his younger sister who seems more mature than him. I don't know if this setting is meant to be a comedy but I don't really feel the comedic point in it. The developments can nicely go very much unpredictable. Yet the unpredictability goes to the direction of weirdness instead of nice. The acting overall is really a mixed work. Joseph Gordon-Levitt sure did well here although I won't say this is as his finest acting work. On the other side Zoey Deschanel did her parts plainly weird. Maybe its her effort to get into character, but I think she really misunderstood her character and misrepresented her instead. Her acting involved much of empty stares as Tom Cruise's involved much grinning as Ethan Hunt."

","This film is about a man who believes a fateful love. In the film, first, the man falls in love with the heroine at first sight and makes an approach to her. Second, he gets along with her, but he finds he is just a friend for her. Finally, their relationship ends and each of them takes their own path for the future. I like the editing of this film because it is easy to understand. Although the film shows 500 days of the couple, the story doesn't progress along time series. However, before the story of a day starts, it is shown when the story happens. Therefore, we aren't confused about time series. Then, I also like the actress of the heroine since she is very cute and acts an appealing woman well. I feel the protagonist has no choice but to fall in love with her at first sight.

","A hard pill to swallow but people who are friend-zoned actually deserve to be friend-zoned! The world is full of forever-alone guys who walk around with their ""nice guys"" tags to keep reminding themselves that they're the nicest people out there and it's an obligation for any girl they have a borderline-psychotic crush on to love them back as a failure to reciprocate the same feelings instantly results in her being termed a ""bitch"".<br/><br/>The term ""friend-zone"" itself implies that the other person's feelings doesn't matter. If a guy or girl has a huge crush on someone, then that someone is expected to give them a chance even if they don't feel a thing for the former & might not even be interested in the first place. Expecting the other person to like you when you don't even have anything unique to offer is both lame & stupid but most believe in this half-assed philosophy of love and when it fails to work out, they blame that crush for ruining their lives.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer makes it very clear in its opening note that all the author intends to do here is to take out the frustration of his failed relationship for a total of 95 minutes. And it works because people with broken hearts are wired to instantly latch on to anything that reminds them of their very own predicament and instead of observing the shortcomings of the protagonist, keep looking for the faults in the one who broke the heart. The whole story is a one-sided perspective of love, expectations & relationship dynamics.<br/><br/>Chronicling the events in a non-linear fashion, (500) Days of Summer tells the story of Tom Hansen, a trained architect working as a greetings card writer, who's recounting the broken memories of his failed relationship with Summer Finn, the girl of his dreams who dumps him one day in an abrupt manner. The plot keeps jumping from one random day to another and shows the progression of their relationship as well as the subsequent depression that Tom undergoes after the break-up, and concludes with him moving on to a better future.<br/><br/>Directed by Marc Webb in what is his feature film debut, the way (500) Days of Summer is narrated is far more refreshing than its content. The film is an honest depiction of the kind of thoughts that surface in mind when one is getting into a relationship or recovering from a bad break-up but it's the movie's clever structure, bright colour palette, hilarious moments, dynamic editing, splendid camera-work & fine use of The Smiths that makes it an enjoyable experience and for the most part, it does quite well on the expectation vs reality graph.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Zooey Deschanel are supposed to be the sorry guy & the bitch respectively and both of them do a neat job at it. Gordon-Levitt is wholly committed to his character Tom Hansen; the hopeless romantic whose life is turned upside down by the girl he's in love with. Deschanel plays Summer who doesn't believe in the existence of true love but does grow closer to Tom until suddenly breaking up with him one day. It's quite easy to call Summer a bitch for what she did to Tom but she is a version of Tom's memory & is intended to be seen that way.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, (500) Days of Summer has its highs n lows just like any relationship but it manages to be an interesting sit, thanks to its confident direction, excellent performances & offbeat storyline that brims with fresh energy, plenty of charm & kinetic flair. A story about love as seen from the eyes of an immature guy who fails to grasp the fact that it is he who's the real architect of all his miseries and not the girl who left him, (500) Days of Summer may not rank amongst the usual examples of its genre(s) but it isn't that different either for what separates it is the tenderness & intellect present in the film's execution rather than the guy- centric content it packs in."
"Mr-Fusion","6","0","0","8 June 2015"," Deschanel's presence suggests a more pleasing movie than it is
","""(500) Days of Summer"" finally clicks into gear somewhere just after the halfway mark when expectations clash with reality and Joseph Gordon-Levitt hits bottom. It' here that I really felt something for this character, and and the rest of the movie picks up from then on, right up until the sweet ending - a sweetness I guess I was expecting much earlier, which is why the first half left me cold. Very stilted and awkward. The supporting cast is lacking here (Moretz is the token common-sense friend), but hearing Richard McGonagle (Sully in ""Uncharted"") narrate this thing was very nice.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good (albeit rocky) story about unrequited love and the pain that that entails, but the best thing here (aside from Gordon-Levitt) is that it's not your formulaic romantic comedy. And that subversion helps make up for the rough patches.<br/><br/>6/10"
"TG22Film","8","0","0","6 April 2015"," A cautionary tale about love
","Before I watched this movie I just was expecting a romcom - a standard slushy movie where boy meets girl over a summer period. I had no expectations of the film and sometimes that's always for the best. I was obviously very pleasantly surprised and then some.<br/><br/>It's made fairly clear from the outset that the two characters Tom Hansen and Summer Finn are destined to have their lives collide in some way. We see it built up through a selection of scenes that build up our sense of the apparent romance going on, but the crucial scene where Zooey Deschanel's character just wants friendship is the film's central and binding core. <br/><br/>As an audience member, you want the couple to become just that. The chemistry seems real, the scenes depicting it fool us into thinking perhaps it may still go somewhere (the IKEA scene with the two pretending that they have already settled down is an example). I related to his naivety in this hope that she will be won over sometime in the course of the casual dating. Gordon Levitt's performance is excellent - you can see in his eyes alone a desperation and desire that doesn't leave him throughout the film, but also a denial that he doesn't want to face the facts. I empathised and sympathised - not least because if someone like Summer Finn was dating you you would probably become exactly the fool he portrays. Her smile and mannerisms are hypnotic, and Zooey's acting seems natural, not forced, to back this up. A number of actresses could have easily overplayed the role, but she is subtle in the way she bounces off Gordon Levitt's moves and charms.<br/><br/>The countdown-of-the-days sequences and whistle-like cue weave perfectly into the story to lure us in to his naive obsession of his date and tempt us into believing the romance of the pair. My favourite part of the movie is probably when they reunite on the train, and during the sunset you don't hear the talking of the characters you just see their facial expressions, but critically you sense this meeting is setting up the finale of their dating, for better or worse. The Temper Trap song beginning to the visual of the last moments on the train is enchanting to the point where you want to be stuck in the moment and not leave it, in spite of all the warning of the story in the scenes before.<br/><br/>The romance lovers in the audience will have at this point been praying for Summer to decide she likes Tom enough to make it a long term relationship. The realists will realise the tragedy of this reunion and that the character who will suffer most is Tom.<br/><br/>When we're shown the reality and expectation split screen, most of us are watching the reality part, but really want to see the expectation happening. At the point of the ring reveal you can feel the heart being torn out of Tom's chest.....and if you've ever been a fool for love, this was a real heartbreaker of a moment that you would be able to relate to. This was actually the one part of the film where I think Zooey's character was a bit cruel. If you are casually dating someone for a long period at least, to not say anything about another involvement I think is harsh.....particularly by way of showing an engagement ring. Or at least I think so.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the review - which is that this film achieves its purpose with the flying colours of a summer festival - to tell a cautionary tale of a one way love obsession, and not to forget the signs that it is, just that."

","The film (500) Days of Summer is a refreshing take on the beaten-to- death genre of love stories. This comedy-drama follows the rise and fall of the relationship between hopeless romantic Tom Hansen, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the truthfully cynical Summer Finn, played by Zooey Deschanel. The film is set in modern day with the backdrop of Los Angeles. Director Marc Webb chose to not approach the film in a standard chronological order, but to jump in between the days of Summer the way that Tom looks back at their pleasures and pitfalls. <br/><br/>The narrator begins the film by warning the audience that this is a story that the story is about a boy and girl but not about their love story. The story progresses in a nonlinear fashion of the 500 days of their relationship and numbers the days to give you chronological reference. The first day that we observe is the day of their relationship ending after watching Tom's ideal romantic film ""The Graduate."" Tom is in shambles with no idea why Summer would want to end the relationship he deemed to be his last. In the beginning, the film cuts back to scenes where the two are innocently enjoying each other's company or Tom is reminiscing about their good times. At the karaoke bar, Summer explains that she is comfortable being defined in her own terms instead of by a relationships. Summer's proclamation of autonomy is a foreshadowing of the fate of their relationship.<br/><br/>The depth of their relationship is beautifully displayed with Webb's choice of directing. The slight chaos of the nonlinear format and mix of styles for the scenes illustrates Tom's battle for coming to terms with the reality that his object of affection does not see the same future for their relationship. (500) Days of Summer feels like an autopsy of a relationship which is unique for its film's genre. We are told the ending from the beginning and use the film to dissect the characters journey to this point. The film also displays a rich sense of style with tasteful choices in the shots of the city. On Tom's tour of the city or his time spent with Summer in the park, the views of Los Angeles are unlike ones you have experienced in other movies.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer provides a fresh take on the development of Summer and Tom's characters. Instead of seeing their characters grow from beginning to end, the viewers get to see their past and future decisions or actions with a flip of the scene. In one scene, Tom is involved in an exuberant dance number while on his way to work after spending his first night with Summer. In the next scene, Tom is miserably shuffling to work while still coping with their break up. The audience is being lead through Tom's memories with his time with Summer almost as if they are in his shoes.<br/><br/>It is rare in this day in cinematic age where a film can be called unique, and that is what (500) Days of Summer did. The innovative choices in directing partnered with the sincere portrayal of the characters by Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel eloquently carry the viewer on the demise of their relationship. The vast array of styles and nonlinear evolution set this film apart from others in its genre. (500) Days of Summer has established itself as an example for future films to strive for such raw individuality."

","At first glance (500) Days of Summer is a traditional romance. Boy meets girl. Boy believes in love, girl doesn't. Boy aims to show girl that love is real. But (500) Days doesn't quite stick with those before it, boldly announcing from the beginning that the film is not a love story. It is not a film devoid of love, but it is about relationships rather than love itself. It instead chronicles the journey from beginning to end of the whirlwind romance and the after-effects.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of getting the viewer caught up in the quirky romance between Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Tom and Zooey Deschanel's Summer mostly due to the wonderful performances from the two actors and the great writing by Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber. There is a real warmth to their performances, and the romance feels natural and real, even despite the impending sense of doom that comes from the future post-relationship days that are littered throughout. The time jumping (complete with telling background animations) makes the viewer acutely aware of the truth of the opening narration, with the future days showing the despondent Tom trying to cope after their romance breaks down. Due to the chemistry between Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel it was necessary for her to marry another man in order to begin the realisation that the relationship truly is over, to both Tom and the viewer who shares in his loss.<br/><br/>The examination of moments from different perspectives showed off how well crafted the scenes were, with the moments being subtle in one viewpoint but so clear from another mindset, and because of this so poignant to real life. People see what they want to see, and quite often that might not be the reality. Tom's incredibly grounded younger sister Rachel (Chloë Grace Moretz) provides this clarity for Tom, and in some ways the audience, and is a generally entertaining character in her limited appearances. Moretz isn't the only supporting character worth mentioning with Tom's co-worker McKenzie and their boss Vance, played by Geoffrey Arend and Clark Gregg respectively, both providing laughs and valuable input to Tom's life.<br/><br/>Summer's final scene, on day 488, is a nice one that finally allows Tom to let her go. Leading to day 500 where he meets a girl who he immediately clicks with and his journey begins all over again. Will she be the one for Tom? Who knows, the film teaches about living in the moment and that it is merely coincidence, not fate, that dictates the direction of lives. The moment that she reveals her name to be Autumn is a little cheesy, but it is effective at driving home the point of the film and Tom's breaking of the fourth wall to acknowledge as such could have easily come across as too much but it is played just right as he reacts along with the audience instead of trying to lead them.<br/><br/>One of the strongest and most inventive scenes pitted ""Expectation"" against ""Reality"" as Tom went to Summer's roof party that actually turned out to be her engagement party. Despite being one of the less subtle ways that the film presented Tom's dashed hopes, it perfectly displayed the contrast in the way that his feeling of love had influenced his mindset on the situation and made the engagement news have the biggest possible crushing impact it could have.<br/><br/>The decision for Tom to work in a greetings card factory was an inspired way to represent the characters emotions through his job, and his dream career of architecture was an effective allegory for the films analysis of relationships.<br/><br/>Despite the potentially dark subject matter the film looks at it from a generally balanced outlook, showing both the highs and lows of relationships with the ultimate message one of hope. The film also has plenty of funny moments that usually feel like laughing with the characters, not at them. The upbeat feeling is also kept alive by the soundtrack that settles along so well with the quirky relationship presented.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer may not be a love story, but in its honest approach to relationships it presents a much more accurate love story than most films out there. The subtlety that Marc Webb presents the affection and the disconnection of the characters with is something that sets this film apart from not just others in its genre, but any film containing a romance of any kind."

Tom's younger sister's Chloe grace Moret is very lovely. In addition to the fun of the contents of this movie, sound music is very good. The movie scenes play in my head when I hear each song. Since I finished seeing this movie, I got to know that this supervisor was a supervisor of music video before. Music matched the image well."

","500 Days of Summer is a movie worth watching because it doesn't feed you the run of the mill pseudo love story that you would expect to see. This movie, starring Zooey Deschanel as Summer and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom, tells us the story of a boy who falls madly in love with a girl who claims to not believe in relationships, but does a less than convincing job at showing us that, based on the way she interacts with Tom. 500 Days of Summer takes us through a journey of the time that Tom and Summer spent together, primarily through Tom's point of view, and shows us the condition in which Summer left him when she seemingly left his life for good. The very beginning of the movie starts by clearly stating that it's not your typical love story, but if you're anything like me, you always root for the underdog. So, when this film stays true to its word, it feels like the biggest plot twist ever encountered, though it told you in a very straightforward manner that there is no happy ending here. It doesn't drag you along with false hope for too long, though. This film doesn't follow chronological order by any means, so Tom and Summer's meet-cute is followed closely by the destruction of their so called ""relationship"". After this point is when viewers get all of the details as to what went on during these 500 days to have produced the existing outcome. <br/><br/>Tom and Summer first meet when she is new to his LA office where he creates greeting cards. Tom falls in love instantly, and from that point we see his interest magnify into a sick puppy- love like obsession based on the idea of who he thinks Summer could potentially be. It's easy to identify with the way he is feeling, because when you're interested in someone, you want to believe that any common interest would make two people suitable. His puppy love only gets more and more heightened the more often he and Summer interact and establish shared interests. You can see right away that Tom is a food blinded by what he thinks is true love, which he decides is real based on minute details, like both of them enjoying The Smiths. Soon, Tom is so sick in love that is practically spills out of his mouth when he talks about her to his friends, who are trying to protect Tom and look out for his best interest. But, as most people in Tom's state of adoration, he is hard-headed and has to learn for himself. Summer takes everything that Tom says to her with a grain of salt, because she refuses to believe in love, claiming it's a ""fantasy"". She has a certain charm to her that she unsuccessfully tries to hide, which is part of why Tom can't stay away from her. <br/><br/>This movie couldn't have been casted with more suitable people to portray these roles, because you really do believe that they are perfect for each other. Scott Neustradter and Michael Weber deserve some recognition for writing such an exceptional script. Part of what makes this such a good movie is that unlike most movies, you can actually relate to these characters, because what they're going through is actually plausible. They don't simply decide one day that they are in love and then have blue birds singing them out of slumber every morning. It's raw and real and full of unfulfilled expectations, which is by far much more realistic and easier to relate to. It's rare to find a well-casted, well-directed film with a near perfect screenplay and a fantastic soundtrack, yet 500 Days of Summer has a way of capturing it all and still managing to portray something contrary to the typical love story."

Tom believes love is important and relationship with Summer is serious, while Summer thinks love is just a thing to enjoy. This difference makes the story interesting. I think this kind of love story is more common than any in our daily life. A boy and girl don't always feel the same way, so they break up and find next one. These experiences are steps for you find your fiancé.<br/><br/>What most two interesting things for me are Summer's fashion and music. In the film, Summer wears 80's clothes.

"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","7 August 2013"," Summertime is here! 500 Days of summer is a bright intelligent movie.
","Directed by Marc Webb, and written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, this creative movie follow the 'non-love story' happenings between Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon Levitt) and that of Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) through nonlinear narrative structure, with the story based upon its male protagonist and his memories of a failed relationship. It's so refreshing to see a romance movie from the guy's perspective. The film get a bit confusing at times as it jumps from various days within the 500-day span of Tom and summer's relationship, indicated by an animation that includes the day's number; this summary is a linear version of the events of the film. On the screens where the numbers of the days in the relationship are shown, the coloring and mood of the background art change to reflect the status of the relationship. Good days are brighter and bad days are darker. While, it can be predictable, because in the first frame we get to know they were going to break up, but having the love story relive thought the goods and bad days make the story seem new. It did help that the scene with them together, were a bit enjoyable even if both characters were being childish or rude to each other. Both protagonists were selfish and self-absorbed in their own way that some people may not like. I love Zooey and Joseph acting here, they're great friends in real life since 2001's Manic and they definitely brought that chemistry to the movie. You really thought they could have been in a relationship. I love all the jokes. The penis yelling joke, and living at IKEA joke are my favorite. 'Darling, I don't know how to tell u this but there's a Chinese family in our bathroom' cracks me up. I love the literal parody on an Ingmar Bergman film. Using 1957's The Seventh Seal is brilliant because it's both a reference and fits into the film perfectly! By losing to Cupid, it's a great symbol of the fate of the main character's relationship with Summer. Also great use of 1967's Graduate. While Tom sees true love, others see euphoria to ones showing more ambivalence. Many people interpret the ending to mean that the two ultimately realize how foolhardy their romantic escapade was or, at least, that they, both harbor doubts about the future. I wouldn't say this is a first date movie because of those scenes in 500 Days of Summer. It's really depressing when you think hard about it. If the humor wasn't so funny, I would have thought gees that isn't what I wanted to watch. You want the characters to have a happy ending ever because some people want to escape and believe that. Who goes on a first date to watch a break up movie? Its heart broking, and watching it felt like it. So, for does thinking it's a happy go lucky romantic movie: do warning. At less, the movie ends somewhat in a good note. It's a really odd film. How many romantic comedies movie do you know that have a disclaimer: ""Any resemblance to people living or dead is purely coincidental. Especially you, Jenny Beckman. Bitch"". Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film was based on a real romance of a real girl who inspired the character Summer. 500 Days of Summer is like a pop song in movie form. I love the great use of music. The scene had an amazing musical sequence after Tom and Summer first spend the night together. As Tom walks to work, he is overjoyed and struts down the street in a grand musical number set to the Hall & Oates song ""You Make My Dreams"" and others join his dance is just wonderful. I do like how Marc Webb created a music video as a companion piece to the film, titled ""The Bank Heist"". It features Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt dancing to ""Why Do You Let Me Stay Here?"", a song by Deschanel's folk group She & Him that help promote the film. Songs from the Smiths, Simon & Garfunkel also play a great part in the film. 'She's got you high' plays great in the credits. My favorite part of the film is the sequence where the screen is split in half. On one side is Reality. On the other, Expectations. The character Tom is going to a party being thrown by Summer. He is hoping to get back together after the break-up with 'Hero' by Regina Spektor playing in the background. We get to see the same scene played out differently. It's scenes like this that make the movie distinctive. Another unique scene is the documentary interview style about love and having Tom said nothing. That's speaks more than words. You would have thought this movie was directed by Woody Allen. It's so remind me of 1977's Annie Hall with all the fourth wall breaking, and European art house film references. Overall: I quite like this movie if it's has a disappointing ending. The romance genre really isn't as strong as other genres and I think it's because filmmakers are often too self-indulgent in these kinds of films. They make the sappy fantasies that people want to see, not necessarily what they need to see, if that makes any sense. Still, 500 days of Summer is careful to tell you that it is not a love story, which really isn't true. It's was marketed as love story. I do not think it really made sense to have a movie like this because most people go to movies to escape reality, not fact it. This movie is definitely about love, but it's just as much about breaking up and coming to terms with the aftermath. I think what they meant to say is that this film is not a conventional romantic comedy. Still, it's get an A+ in my book."

","""500 Days"" accurately depicts how ""love"" works. The fact is, you feel how you feel and you have no control over that. Summer was cynical about love, and set out to enjoy her time with Tom without an emotional investment. Tom, on the other hand was willing to put everything out there for this ""relationship."" Who was the more honest? Summer who made clear from the start she would remain detached emotionally? Or, Tom who was for the most part an open book when it came to what he wanted and what he was willing to risk for Summer? Both, in fact, were equal in their honesty. Both remained true to themselves. Although, you might argue that Summer was playing ""games"" in fact she was not. And, that is born out in the end when she finds someone who trips her trigger, so to speak. That is when she loses her cynicism and is capable of investing emotionally in a relationship. She just needed to meet the right person. That is how love works. Not to be forgotten, Tom, of course, is wounded by Summer's rejection. He laments the fact that she didn't tell him about her engagement, but the fact is he had been warned from the very beginning when he met Summer. A lot of pain can be avoided if we would just really listen to what we are being told and not just plow ahead because of what we think we want and need. As a result Tom becomes the bitter, hurt, and cynical one. And, that also is how love works. Love can put us on top of the highest peak or it can pull us down into the depths of hell. But, as with Summer, and as with Tom at the end, often when we feel we are incapable of loving, of committing, of sharing our time, and investing emotionally, we meet someone who makes us come alive and changes our perspective on love and life. That is also how loves works. Despite the disclaimer at the beginning of ""500 Days of Summer,"" this truly was a love story."

This film is honest and goes into detail that not all relationships are meant to be and not all have perfect, happy endings as shown in most movies.

","I only recently saw this film, after hearing for three years that it was brilliant. I therefore expected it to fall short of my expectations, but I was incredibly, pleasantly surprised: (500) Days of Summer is, in fact, brilliant.<br/><br/>The focus of this movie is love, one of the most prevalent themes in cinema, yet it is approached unconventionally here. This is no vapid romcom, no Nicholas Sparks-esque tear trigger, not even a tragedy reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet; rather, it is a study of how people feel and form relationships in the real world, and is therefore emotionally resonant on a level that most films don't reach.<br/><br/>Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a hopeless romantic, ready to fall head-over-heels in love, yet Summer (Zooey Deschanel), the girl he decides is the love of his life, entertains no such fantasies, and is fundamentally opposed to relationships in general. Though they are apparently ill-fitted for one another, their lives intertwine over these 500 days, and they find themselves becoming... something. Something fuzzy and indistinct, something that looks different from each of their perspectives, something between friends and true lovers in sync with one another.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel both deliver perfect performances. Tom is heartrendingly naive, experiencing true misery for the first time as he comes to realize that his view of the world has been wrong for too long, and Summer is not a caricature. It is evident that she feels just as much as Tom, albeit differently, and she is honest with him and herself right from the beginning. Neither character is entirely in the right or entirely in the wrong - they are real people coming face to face with the real questions of what love is and what it should be and how it is interpreted by different people.<br/><br/>Though I really enjoy the story itself, the method of its telling adds significantly to its merit as a creative work. Elements of the story's setting and setup - they meet in a greeting card factory, Tom's teenage sister is the voice of reason on which he depends - establish the movie's quirkiness. Directorial and narrative decisions also add interest: there is an outer layer to the story (a narrator, decorative title cards that reflect the mood at the point in the story they reference, the fourth wall gets close to being broken); it is told out of order (hence the need for title cards establishing chronology); events and internal monologues are displayed creatively (split screens, scenes from foreign films). The ending - without giving anything away - is fabulous.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is my favorite kind of movie. It doesn't present a message heavy-handedly but does make you think, features great actors, and breaks Hollywood conventions. I would definitely recommend it."

It's a really enjoyable film to watch simply because it's different.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt acts really well in this and can be quite funny. You can tell he and Zooey Deschanel are good friends because they work really well on screen together. Deschanel is good; she portrays her character very well as you genuinely dislike her by the end of the film and are glad to see the ending be that they don't stay together just because she is such a nasty piece of work. I will note that this is the third or fourth film of Deschanels' that I've seen her sing. Despite her being able to hold a tune I don't understand why this is included in all of her films. It would be interesting to find out if it is the directors or Deschanel herself who request this to be added into the scripts (sometimes a little hurriedly). <br/><br/>The layout of the film can be a little confusing to follow because the story is broken up into several pieces and they are not played in chronological order. It is a very clever way to lay out the film however and it did work really well for this.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a delightful little film that deserves a bit more recognition."

","The story had potential - the intention itself was potentially amazing - but the lines just got blurred between pity and depression and then cheerfulness. I felt this was supposed to lead somewhere, but I felt there was a lack of a connection - where were the explanations that at least gave us an idea of what was going on? There were scenes showing the two main characters doing something and then it changed to a different day. What kind of relationship were they even in? I have nothing against what people do in their relationships, but when it comes to films, they really need to do their research. <br/><br/>One of the good points was the light-hearted humour - it was funny sometimes. Despite the film itself being quite light, it was at least mildly entertaining. The two actors - Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt - I like them very much, as they provided a certain presence that meant the film didn't turn out awful - they looked the part, particularly. <br/><br/>On that note, the film seemed light on plot. It felt like it was trying to preach a message about love. 'This isn't a love story, this is a story about love' - that doesn't sound unique, that sounds cheesy. It would, if it could actually follow a structure that wasn't a complete mess. So, no, in fact, this film had nothing new or of use so it was looking too desperate to preach a message about love, when in fact it wasn't."

","I loved this movie. Despite giving it a seven which is low for my usually ratings, there is reasoning behind it. Though warned at the start of the film that this was not a love story but a story about love, i still expected a cheesy love story, and obviously was disappointed that this was in fact as the narrator stated 'a story about love'. none the less this is a brilliant film. The acting by both Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordan-Levitt is tremendous, i am a big fan of both of their work. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard for a long while as i am also a big fan of Regina Spektor. I think my favourite part of this film is the moral story behind it, you'll have to watch it to understand what i mean, and that is why i loved this film.<br/><br/>All in all i have no complaints about this film and if you haven't seen it you should definitely pop it on your watch list"
"rmukeshgupta","9","0","0","1 January 2012"," This is indeed a love story (which ends differently)
","We are warned by the narrator at the start of the film, that this is not a love story.. I think this was an attempt to condition the audiences rather than anything else. <br/><br/>The movie moves in a non-linear time line which makes the movie that much more interesting. <br/><br/>The actors (Gordon-Levit and Zooey Deschanel) easily fill in the shoes of the characters. The characterization is so good that you simply do believe that these are people who could be a part of your life. <br/><br/>The presence of friends (one with a girl-friend since school & one with no hope of getting a girl-friend) are so much part of anyone's life. <br/><br/>The manager in the office, who realizes that his employee is going through a lean period thinks of using this phase to get him to create sad greeting cards rather than the happy love cards that he is used to creating. You can always find managers like this in your offices. <br/><br/>The leads are characterized by their simplicity (the dressing sense of Tom, the dressing and the hair-style of Summer). <br/><br/>As they grow closer, the air of confidence displayed by Tom is infectious. Their break-up breaks his heart completely. The scene in which Tom goes to the super market to buy some soda and drinks in his bathrobe is another scene which really shows the heart-break that this guy is going through. <br/><br/>And then the finish. As they say, after every storm, there is a new start. Knowing that Summer is now finally out of his life, the way Tom re-starts his life, going after his long standing dream of becoming an architect. <br/><br/>That's when he meets Autumn (named intelligently) at an interview. That's when the film ends, leaving it to the speculation of the audience on what would conspire between Tom & Autumn. <br/><br/>What I really like about the film is that it is different, yet very realistic. The film also ends on the promise of hope!"

","Children, once upon a time the romantic comedy was a legitimate movie subgenre. Then along came people like Matthew Mcconaughey (don?t care if that is misspelled) and Jennifer Lopez among many others who began to pump out unfunny and unromantic films which all seem to not only have the same plot but basically the same characters (all of whom have well-defined abdominal muscles). Now children, these weren?t bad people ? even good actors like John Cusack fell for the temptation of making a coupla? bucks off the 18-54, white, female, movie-going demographic. Ah, but children, there is hope in the form of video-director Marc Webb who has created a romcom with real (fake) emotion, actual laugh-out-loud moments and an intriguing plot which defies the traditional conventions of the subgenre yet still delivers a satisfying ending. The film is cast with a focus on brains over abs so that when Tom falls in love with and later can?t get over Summer we actually understand why and feel what he feels. The nonlinear narrative structure (don?t panic children, you?ll get it) keeps the audience going alert and thinking and the soundtrack carries the film when necessary but doesn?t intrude when not (listen for Simon & Garfunkel?s genius ?Bookends? ). In short, rush out and rent this beguiling work so we get more like it."
"krah0051","Null","0","0","22 September 2011"," Thank Summer for Autumn!
","You probably wouldn't call (500) Days of Summer a conventional romance, but it'll woo lovers of the genre nonetheless. Between Tom Hansen's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, playing the movie's protagonist) often crushed hopes and the ecstatic heights of joy brought upon him by his love interest, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), the writers and cast take the film's viewers through twists and turns, ranging from stricken expressions of awe to the grin that brightens one's face as they contentedly sit back in their seat. While the film incorporates the happy, the sad and the ""everything in between"" kind of moments, it never seems to stray too far from reality, making for an entertaining and relatable show. Anybody who's been in a good relationship gone wrong, sour or just plain heart-wrenchingly asunder will find abundant consolation in the message this movie offers to everyone under the sun.<br/><br/>The casting—long story short—was magnificent. Tom Hansen is without a shadow of a doubt the most relatable of the film's characters (and as the protagonist, you'd expect). While trained as an architect, he finds himself stuck in a rut writing for a card company, choked day in and day out by his unfulfilled potential. Gordon-Levitt indulges in the role, never missing his mark as a chance comes along to display genuine emotion. From his subtleties of expression to his spoken manifestations, he plays off 'love-stricken confidence,' time after time, absent of monotony at that. Countering, however, Deschanel makes for the perfectly unconventional, intriguingly mysterious, not-so-girl-next-door. The two play off of each other so well that it's easy to fall under the actors' spell, believing that the recounting of actual events is superseding such fictional story-telling. <br/><br/>Seldom failing to please, the alternate media (music, animation, etc.) in the film make for just another level of added depth, and consistent emotional prompts give the viewer a strong sense of connectedness to Tom's sentiments, further allowing the uninhibited relating to one's personal life. Another striking feature of this movie is the way in which the story is presented—numerous non-linear jumps are made back and forth, from Tom and Summer's early to late relationship. Such style reveals bit by piece how the story unfolds, never giving the viewer a clear prediction of the conclusion; rather, it allows onlookers the chance to connect, in conclusion, the many detached portions of the couple's relationship once the final piece of the puzzle is revealed. And while some moments present themselves equivocally at first, the viewer is never left uncomprehendingly confused."

","The film was enjoyable but it tried too much to be artsy. The biggest problem I had was that the film jumped from one date to another without rhyme or reason. It had that quirky feel and was definitely different than a typical romantic comedy. I still felt the film lacked in consistency . The acting was fine as was the direction. 500 days represents the length of the the relationship. Ultimately what kept this film from being extraordinary was that it tried too hard to be different. I think by jumping around it confused the viewer of the film. It truly was a film worth watching but it could have been much more."
"p-stepien","8","0","0","15 January 2011"," Love in a nutshell
","Tom Hansen (played by the phenomenal Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a mild-mannered card-writing architect. You know - the guy who thinks up lines in birthday cards and such, but in truth wants to mold the city-line. A romantic at heart he deftly falls in love with his new co-worker Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Jumping from across 500 days (to and fro) the movie presents us the high and lows of their relationship and break-up, as well as with the hardships with letting go of the love that keeps him bound to Summer. Everything pulsating with intelligent dialogue, subtle and funny humour, as well as with some really thoughtful input on sex, love and the other relationship stuff.<br/><br/>Slightly experimental quirky romantic comedy with an intriguing scattered structure, which does not draw much comparisons to anything I've ever seen. And that's despite the fact that the movie is populated with pop-cultural references and borrowed scenes from other movies on an almost Tarantino-like level. Frontlining Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in my opinion the best actor of his generation (including i.e. Leonardo di Caprio) to such a strong script also does a multitude of favours for the movie, as he manages to sell the full range of emotions from love and passion to hate and despair seemingly without an effort. I do however find Zooey Deschanel unable to cope with the character and script she is offered (a feeling I see is not popular among viewers). The character she plays is irritating, self-centered and essentially unlikeable. I understand that relationships mean that opposites attract, but Summer is sold at the beginning of the movie through voice-over as the heart and soul of the universe, but ultimately she is scripted as a heartless, unbelievably selfish and egoistical vixen, which seems to conflict with earlier information on her person. That said Zooey's chemistry with Tom is spot on and albeit she never has the same screen presence as Gordon-Levitt she does an admirable back-up job, which helps the story flow and entrench us into the high-and-lows for their relationship. All in all the misgivings of her character have to be put on the shoulders of the script, but Zooey never seems to have the strength of character to convince me that she is worth the despair.<br/><br/>Thankfully however Summer is a supporting character and despite relatively good screen-time she fades into the background of the emotions and feelings of Tom Hansen, who dominates the screen throughout the movie, even when singing ""The Pixies"" during drunken karaoke. The question essentially isn't whether Summer deserves Tom's admiration and love, but on the process he goes through and where it leads him to in life.<br/><br/>Apart from Summer the remaining cast on the movie is extremely intriguing and likable, especially highlighted by a very influential minor role by ""Kick Ass""'s Chloe Moretz.<br/><br/>I have minor issues with a couple of scenes, albeit one concerns the climax of the movie, when Tom quits his job. Tom basically starts throwing out nonsensical 'deep thoughts' in front off his work comrades, which seem forced and are a bit lacking in any substantial afterthought. Given this is a key scene it slightly hit the overall grading of this almost perfect movie. I always wasn't too keen on the solution of the movie and the way Tom passed on to Autumn. The whole sequence felt a bit stale - as if the scriptwriter got hit by a deadline and quickly pasted on the first ending that came to mind.<br/><br/>In the end minus one for the character of Summer and another minus one for a couple of badly written scenes."

","""You weren't wrong, Tom. You were just wrong about me.""<br/><br/>I find myself having to revisit my original review and bump the score up, because this movie gets better every single time I see it.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is very unconventional, but in this case, unconventional is a welcome change. The whole relationship genre seems to suffer from being too dour (Two Lovers), too formulaic (a bazillion movies starring Katherine Heigl and her kind), or simply too saccharine for anyone with a Y-chromosome. Just for avoiding those pits, (500) Days of Summer deserves some kind of special award at the Oscars. <br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel is great, of course. This role is similar to those she's had in movies and shows like Gigantic and Weeds, but that's just because she's so believable as this kind of character. Joseph isn't really stretching outside his comfort range, either, but once you've seen this, you won't be able to imagine anyone else in his place. <br/><br/>The movie itself is a mixture of unnervingly genuine moments and fanciful flourishes. The narrator (don't you love narrators in movies?) tells you what you're in for within the first five minutes of the movie, and you'd be wise to believe him. It's not that you're not going to get a happy ending, it's just that this movie is similar to life; the happy ending you get may not be the one you were looking for."
"Floated2","8","0","0","26 August 2010"," Its original but nothing special
","500 days of summer is an original type of film that attempts to be funny using a variety of animation, voice-over, split-screen, slow- mo, and semi-documentary techniques along with an unusual jumping back and forth from future and past inserts that only results in a series of short-attention span. The end scenes of this movie almost make up for the chaotic, choppy, jerky editing that really detracts from the potential for a more traditional romantic drama that could have been even more powerful because the edgy script in linear form was likely great to begin with. There were many unnecessary dialogues and scenes but it was alright.<br/><br/>While watching the film, it seemed clear that Summer was really into Tom as a boyfriend. First Tom gets Summer to go out with him. She says she wants it casual, but he really falls for her. She breaks it off and he's miserable for months after. Tom turns to his much younger sister to give the advice he needs. Then at the end, when the they for a final time, she tells him that she's married. She was really not nice to him and acted mean. Overall the film is decent but tries too hard to be fresh and exciting. Though its an opinion you. ==================================================================== ====================================================================<br/><br/>After a rewatch 09/06/17' and many years later, opinions have somewhat changed as I watched this film from a different perspective and forgot many scenes. We can understand why it is as praised as it isn't the typical Hollywood romance film we see today. The two leads are great and elevate the film making it better but many scenes seemed to drag. Although it is better on a second viewing as there are some things must have missed on its initial viewing. Rating changed from 6 to 8."

","You're lucky if once a year you find a pleasant gem like this one that has you cheering as you walk out of the theatre, not only for its uplifting nature but its artistic insight.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is, in many ways, a psychological study of the affect a romantic relationship has on a person. Chronologically, this film is out of whack, to say the least. But not until now am I realizing just how much this movie traveled back and forth across its story's timeline. There is a smooth flow to the chaos. We start with Tom (Joseph Gordon- Levitt) in a sad state (to put it mildly) and go from there, traversing the mountains and valleys of the relationship from Tom's emotional perspective.<br/><br/>Director Marc Webb doesn't take a defining approach to the story. This seemed to bother Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, as the film was ""searching for a style."" But how else do you expect to portray a relationship? It can't be told in just one way. There are too many dimensions to it all and too many emotions to convey.<br/><br/>The title has been listed two ways, one with the parenthesis surrounding the 500 and one without. I prefer to use the parenthesis. Just to say ""500 Days of Summer"" seems to label those 500 days of the relationship between Tom and Summer as a sum of sorts. It's like looking at the relationship as a whole and ignoring the individual elements that make it that whole. This movie examines those individual elements and contrives an epic journey that is universal in all aspects.<br/><br/>Tom is all of us. Watch this film and you will find yourself feeling what he feels because you've been there before. Summer (wonderfully casted as Zooey Deschanel) has that child- like look in her eyes that makes you melt. You can't help but fall for her pleasant demeanor and be heartbroken when you realize Tom is ultimately not what she wants."

This isn't your average romance/slash chick flick, and to be personally honest i didn't think i would get into it by watching the beginning of the film i felt oh boy another movie i have to sit through for the wife's sake but no it grew on me. I love Joseph Gordon Levitt to death and he reminds me a lot of Heath Ledger (dont ask me why) but he does. He once again does a bang on job of the very confused male (like that is rare) and Zooey Deschanel who i am still wondering how she is going to do when she stars as Janis Joplin in the upcoming bio, is the very confusing love interest here who wants a relationship without labelling it so...or at least thats what i got from her character. either that or she was afraid of commitment needless to say it was a nice change seeing the role reversal here as according to Hollywierd usually has the woman being the jaded one. thats where Marc Webbs genius comes into play. Need to mention Criminal Mind's Matthew Gray Gubler has a small part in this although being nice to see him act another character then Dr. Spencer Reid, that's unfortunately all i kept seeing every time i saw him on screen.

No, this movie is a simple relation of a life experience I imagine we all go through, that of falling so madly in ""love"" with someone we lose reality and can't see the glaring signs of destruction ahead and those equally opposing bitter feelings when reality comes crashing in when we realize that person we are obsessed with isn't obsessed back.<br/><br/>If you are looking to have your mind blown away and a new perspective plopped right into it, this probably isn't the film for you.

","A beautiful look on true relationships makes up (500) Days of Summer. Nothing more than a sweet, touching, and believable antics do Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel get into. I should state, like in the movie, that this is a story of ""Boy meets girl"". It is in no way ""A love story"". This is a movie, that surpasses the title of ""Just another quirky Romantic Comedy"".<br/><br/>The movie is about sweet and simple Tom Hansen(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who looks and frets over the ""girl of his dreams"". He is an architect, though works as a Greeting Card Maker of all jobs. One day, his boss gets a new assistant, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschannel). Tom is in the love at first site stage. He denies it, but the fact of the matter is it's undeniably true.<br/><br/>After learning Summer like the same music as he does, Tom tries to hint Summer he likes her and wants to go out. After numerous attempts fail, he sucks it up and spends time with her. The duo play the ""mommy and daddy"" like relationship. Going to Ikea to pretend the appliances are actually theirs and frequently going out to dinner.<br/><br/>The storyline and chronological order of the movie overall impresses me to great extent. It's played out in days, though skips frequently so the audience doesn't have to watch everyday, throughout.<br/><br/>When something goes well in Tom's life, it flashes to a point in the movie were something doesn't go right. Tom than becomes almost obsessed with Summer and believes she is the girl for him and nothing can stop him from ""winning her over"".<br/><br/>After various uses of quotations around different love quotes I should state my reasoning that this movie takes a lot of aspect of all the love terms out there and uses a bit of each one. The director of this movie, Marc Webb, in which this is his debut film, does a wonderful job with this movie.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is not by any means a love story. It's a true visionary piece composed of stunning lines and a beautiful relationship between Joesph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschannel who very much could be a couple more than just on screen.<br/><br/>Starring: Joesph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschannel.

","I highly recommend watching (500) Days of Summer if you get a chance. It is not your typical love story; it touches on something a lot of romantic comedies do not: unrequited love. The film shows the damage that can be caused by being in a nonexclusive relationship, which is something that is not shown very often. It puts a different perspective on the dating game, which I really enjoyed.<br/><br/>A highlight of the movie is the documentary segment which includes four or five views on love from various characters in the film. It has quite possibly one of the most powerful quotes about relationships that I have seen in a movie. The character Paul says: ""Robyn is better than the girl of my dreams. Why is that? She's real."" All in all, I would definitely suggest checking this movie out. There is nothing that I dislike about it."
"bluepolkadotsxo","10","0","0","22 June 2010"," A story of unrequited love,
","500 days of summer is one of my all-time favorite movies. I think the biggest reason why some people couldn't bring themselves to like this movie is because it is about young love, and many who are older and ""wiser"" (more or less) can't understand or appreciate that anymore. They think it is silly and juvenille and won't put themselves in the character's place. Weren't they that age once? And the other reasons are among the I-hate-everything-and- expect-an-Oscar-worthy-movie-every-time-i-turn-on-my-TV or they simply believe this is over rated and overthink it way too much, not to mention magnify or come up with flaws. Or, they found themselves hating the main characters just because they have different personality types and are unable to relate to them. Anyway, this movie is astoundingly original in the way it is written and the story itself, Zoeey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt are both talented actors/actresses and have great chemistry together, and it's a very relatable story that makes us soft-hearted personality types feel warm inside after watching. The music is also great. The thing I love most about this movie was how realistic it is; too many times you see a movie when in the end, the protagonist always ends up back with his long lost lover. They get together, break up, make up, happily ever after. 500 days of summer breaks this clichéd plot and tells a tragically real boy-meets-girl story of unrequited love. And, we are still left with an ending that makes us feel good."
"airguitar57","9","0","0","19 June 2010"," A special kind of romantic-comedy
","With (500) Days of Summer, first time director Marc Webb makes a film for a new generation. Channeling an honesty and charm, to define (500) Days of Summer as a romantic-comedy feels like an injustice. At the very least, it proves that not all romantic-comedies are created equal.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer chronicles the full relationship of Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Tom, a trained architect, works at a greeting card company in Los Angeles. He is a hopeless romantic raised on The Graduate with the belief that he is destined to meet his perfect girl and future wife. Summer arrives to the office as the new assistant of Tom's boss. She is a free spirit without a true belief in romantic love. Tom immediately falls for Summer. The rest of the film tells their story from start to finish, covering all of the ups and downs that occur in their relationship.<br/><br/>The film uses a non-linear style to tell its story, hopping from each important day of the relationship, often juxtaposing the feelings of a young relationship with those of a dying one. From the first time this is employed I fully expected to hate this style. Following Pulp Fiction, this non-linear style of storytelling could be seen left and right. While Pulp Fiction is able to use this style quite effectively, crafting a film that cannot be imagined in any other way, other films felt more kitsch than functional in their attempts to make something ""edgy"". Imagine my surprise when I found myself fully enjoying the way the technique is used in (500) Days of Summer. At no point is the style distracting, rather it feels necessary. The film is a chance for Tom to consider his relationship with Summer, and we feel more as voyeurs to his experience. When reminiscing on a past relationship, you do not revisit linearly and in this way, it makes sense for the film to hop from moment to moment.<br/><br/>The success of the film derives from its honesty. In a time where Hollywood is spewing out fantastical ideas of the modern romance with films like Twilight and Dear John, (500) Days of Summer is a breath of fresh air. The writers, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, put together scenes that are so authentic that it makes you wonder why they aren't put on screen more often. The relationship starts awkwardly, with Tom expressing a curious shyness and fear of destruction that accompanies those first conversations with a new love. The degradation of the relationship never feels forced or sudden; rather Summer drifts from Tom organically making Tom's ultimate heartbreak all the more realistic.<br/><br/>The film does however, still prescribe to some romantic-comedy clichés. Summer at times, comes across as your typical ""manic pixie dream girl"", with such a desire to simply remain ""free"" that often lacks believability. Tom's quirky friend McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and his best friend Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) feel incomplete as characters and seem to exist simply to allow Tom to communicate his feelings vocally. However, the character of Rachel (Chloë Moretz), Tom's sassy and wise beyond her years little sister, manages to overcome her cliché and remain rooted in the real, something that should be attributed to the chemistry between Gordon-Levitt and Moretz.<br/><br/>The film deserves credit for reveling in its indie quirkiness. With a ""voice of God"" narration by Richard McGonagle, that gives the film an occasional fairytale quality, there is a freshness that doesn't go unnoticed. At the very least, the film deserves credit for being the first on screen presence of the oft played by adolescents ""penis game"", and the admission that on their best day, every guy can feel like Han Solo. It does rest on the occasional cliché, but (500) Days of Summer succeeds in being an honest romantic-comedy for a new generation."

The movie simply brings us into the mood of love easily, where sometimes there are laughter and joy, and the other times there are hesitation and sadness. In several scenes, they keep asking each other, ""where will thiz relationship goes to?"" If you love somebody that just happens and you could tell her anytime and anywhere, it doesn't matter where the place is. Maybe it is not that simple, but we know even love doesn't last forever, but commitment does. The ending is far from idealistic, but more close to reality.

Some days later, I saw the movie poster again, so I came here and searched for it and I saw it has good rating, and it was about romance and I use to like movies like that. so, I decided to watch it.... And I absolutely don't regret it. <br/><br/>The movie starts with almost the end... so, I thought it was going to ruin the movie because I thought there was a happy ending between them and they'd last, but then, there's Tom sad and angry because Summer dumped him, but he says he would get her back, which I thought he would do. But then, throughout the movie is a funny and happy story of Tom and Summer, which at the end, I thought it was sad... Not the typical romantic movie with a happy ending. It is a smart story, and well told, and you can easily relate with the characters.<br/><br/>Zooey and Joseph give an amazing and smart role, and it was well acted. Another thing that I like about this movie, is the soundtrack... One of the bests I've heard! Thanks this movie, I found the Smiths, and I specially loves the Song ""Hero"", it takes me to the movie, to that particular scene which I think is the most ""tragical"" and sad. The climax of the story. Expectations vs. Reality. And the songs reflects the movie, and the feelings of the Character's, specially Tom's.<br/><br/>This movie is worth watching, heart touching, funny, happy, but sad, and it's so realistic. At the beginning, you are warned that this is not a love story, and I think it's true, but not at all... It is a smart love story, a realistic one (I am not saying that love stories with happy endings are not realistic) and I think that's why I loved it! As i say before, you can easily relate to the plot, and you can feel character's feelings and emotions.<br/><br/>One of my favorites movies ever...."

","Have you ever seen Say Anything? Or for the matter any John Cusack movie from the 80's? Let me give you a short summery: boy is a kindhearted, hopeless romantic that believes in love, and the ""one in a million girl"" he falls for is cute (bangs for bonus points) cool, quirky, yet passive, icy heart breaker. Well if you've seen those, then you're familiar with 500 Days of Summer a romantic comedy, that's a ""story of boy meets girl...but not a love story"" yeah that was said by the narrator of the film, and yeah its has crappy narration.<br/><br/>A year ago an article in the onion pinpointed a certain kind of female archetypical character named ""The Manic Pixie Dream Girl"". Basically it explains a style of film about a live-in-the-moment hyperactive super cute girl that a dopey guy falls in love with not only for her charm and vitality, but for the ride of unexpected spur of the moment events she brings him on that helps remind him what its like to feel alive. 500 days of Summer falls right dab in the middle of this category because the main character, Summer (Zooey Deschanel), is the epitome of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl.<br/><br/>Then there is the indie namedropping, ohh, the indie namedropping. This movie tries so hard to appeal to the alternative crowd it makes Juno look innocent. From its role-call of indie fav's from yesterday and today (The Smiths, The Pixies, Regina Spektor...Ringo) to its too cute, schmaltzy, over endearing quality, this movie wants to be Garden State without the sincerity or Natalie Portman. Its as if the film tries to convince you a quirky relationship never existed before these two got together and did ""crazy"" stuff like go into IKEA's living room section and pretend to be a married couple watching TV. Or rent a porno together and try some of the positions, because, you know, regular girls just aren't weird enough for something that zany. This film should become the mad libs template for the hopeless romantic guy falling for the too cool alt. girl (including the two best guy friends and a wise beyond her years little girl) its nothing more, nothing less. John Cusack eat your broken heart out.<br/><br/>Oh, if you're still reading this, there is one other gripe I have about these types of films, and it's about the nature of these kinds of relationships. Listen guys, here is a tip if you identify with Tom (Joseph Gordan-Levitt) plight: it's not going to work. Any time (in any sort of relationship) if one person is more in love with the other then the other is with them, then it will be one sided and unbalanced. Plus obsessing over a girl is an unattractive quality. Show some backbone and don't fall for the sentiment of these types of films. There is nothing wrong with being romantic, but being an obsessive whiner isn't going to get you anywhere, even if you're holding a boom box over your head...unless you're Ben Gibbard, but you're not."
"Robert_duder","7","0","0","8 April 2010"," Critically acclaimed romance...but light on the romance
","It would be incredibly hard to convince me that (500) Days of Summer is a romance of any kind. Perhaps one of the reasons that critics were so taken by it is that it is more a story of realistic relationship...sad perhaps but true. Redeemable almost entirely by the sole performance of the male lead but unlike most typical ""romance"" movies the female lead is almost entirely unlikable. It isn't the fault of the actress but rather the story that really paints the male character as the deeply emotional, sensitive, and sweet guy and pair him with a commitment phobic, and almost un-emotional girl. The film runs through the almost two years of their on again, off again ""friendship"" in various stages and does truly demonstrate every possible range of the relationship. The film has a sweet indie feel to it with some really nice settings and nature like cinematography.<br/><br/>Essentially there are two performances in this film that matter at all. The supporting cast is scarce and while they all are decent, there aren't any truly outstanding supporting roles. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is really making a name for himself and I expect he has a big, big role in his future. For the time being he seems to be set into the indie circuit but giving some impressive performances. In this film he borderlines being almost whiny but fortunately stays on the side of truly likable. As Tom Hansen he shows a truly soft side that will make most women melt and most guys feel sensitive...secretly. Has Zooey Deschanel ever had a truly good role? She was decent in Elf. She should have been banned from acting after The Happening. She gives a decent performance in this film but is unfortunately tasked with a very bad character. She has so many emotional problems that she comes across as cold to the man who falls in love with her. They have good chemistry but you get so attached to how Gordon-Levitt feels that you despise Deschanel for hurting him.<br/><br/>There is an unfortunate stigma attached to both primarily TV directors, and music video directors. Marc Webb has very little experience on a big screen film and customary to many music video directors they think the best style is to flip through various scenes to tell a story which can sometimes lead to it being rushed and seem like a mish-mash of ideas. The story not always being in chronological order doesn't help but is fairly easy to follow along thanks to the 500 days concept and the naming of what day they are in to their relationship. It has to be said in an off topic I think the idea of Marc Webb being pegged for the Spiderman reboot is a terrible one both pun wise and director wise. The writing team of Michael Weber and Scott Neustadter are new to Hollywood and their only other claim to fame is The Pink Panther 2 (nuff said.) (500) Days of Summer is entertaining and will definitely have you talking by the end of it like gossip bad mouthing Deschanel for what she has done to Tom. See it but don't expect a lovely romance, its rather harsh. 7/10"

","500 Days of Summer? I would call it ""5700 Seconds of Love"".<br/><br/>You may have seen many different love stories in different language. When did you saw a movie which tells the story of love? The movie starts with a quote "" This is not a love story. This is a story about love"". Interesting, Isn't it? Well our boy is, Tom Hansen of Margate, NewJersey, Grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy. Until the day he met ""the one"". And our girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock Michigan did not share this belief. Since the disintegration of her parents marriage. And for Tom Hansen to find it now in a city of 400,000 offices,91,000 commercial buildings and 3.8 million people well, that could only be explained by one thing: fate. This is how director describes Tom's love.<br/><br/>Tom meets Summer on January 8. He knows almost immediately she's who he's been searching for. The story stars from 488th day and it goes on randomly around those 500 days.

"Moviefreak4653","3","0","0","1 March 2010"," Pretentious and Undeserving of its Praise
","Fox Searchlight Pictures, having become something of a prestigious name amongst indie distribution, usually never tends to disappoint. Somehow they can always manage to find feel good, fresh, and original films that typically have a mainstream marketability and yet still seemingly has that indie charm, (500) Days of Summer isn't one of them. <br/><br/>This movie has to be, without a doubt, the most wannabe, and pretentious film I have ever seen. Many scenes it becomes so blatantly obvious that the writers thought that they were just spinning out magic. That's not to imply that there isn't any passion here, I just don't think the film, nor writers behind it, are entirely deserving of this so-called praise when everything is contrived and desperate to pander to an audience equally pretentious and mundane. As bad as this film wants you to believe, there's nothing independent about it - in the sense that it doesn't possess this original, witty charm that it wants you to think it does. It's as if they watched every successful romantic comedy/ independent film and tried to mimic what they did – and believe me, it's not as wonderful as it sounds. Never have I rolled my eyes so many times at a film, strictly because every scene oozes with ""Oh wouldn't this be so original,"" or ""oh this is going to be so witty! This'll definitely get us that Best Screenplay nod and earn us our hipster credibility.""<br/><br/>Elaborate you ask? Let's start with the blatant use of ""off the wall"" humor: To exemplify how this Summer character is supposedly such an extraordinary person who makes an impact anywhere she goes, it portrays her as having a charm so profound that some major study shows ice cream sales increasing all because she was working in a parlor or something. So original and desperate to seem quirky. And a comedic approach to Tom's depression? Breaking plate after plate after plate. So quirky and so innovative! Why couldn't this film be in 3D on the off chance that a shard of the plate fly into my eyeballs? And the wisecracking down-to-earth little sister, and what's that, she curses to? That is SO funny. It's not entirely that these are bad things, they're not, they are- to a certain degree- original or at least have potential but it's all too much of a desperate attempt to seem likable and to achieve ""greatness"" they haven't earned. I imagine the film was planned like this: ""Let's do this love story, but an ANTI love story (although there's nothing really anti about it), and this guy will have the most random, quirkiest job we can think of, and he'll be smitten with her with a Smiths reference (because nothing screams great indie musical taste like the Smiths – hipster thinks he's cool because he listens to the Smiths?). Oh and there has to be this drunken karaoke bar scene and he'll sing a Pixies song! What Pixies song would ever be in karaoke machine, maybe ""Where is My Mind,"" never ""Here Comes Your Man."" Just saying...<br/><br/>The film's execution of their so-called romance is even more infuriating. It's not that the writing is lazy, the sad part really is that the writers think it's good - I guess misguidedly uninspired? The ending did surprise me in that, even though I was not emotionally invested in the film/ characters, I was still annoyed and rather irate about the ending.<br/><br/>Zooey Deshanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt play their characters well enough to make me want to like them, but again, they did nothing to earn my sympathy or care. If the film had suddenly taken a violent turn and have their entire office burn down and kill everyone inside? I wouldn't have cared. Maybe it caught me on a bad day, or maybe it just sucked? I guess a lot of people disagree with me, and I guess generally speaking I would recommend it, but personally I wouldn't because this one just didn't do it for me."

","Well this was a rare insightful romantic comedy in which the guy doesn't wind up with the girl. I'm not sure if the movie required non-linear editing - not sure what that accomplished - but I like the story that was told. <br/><br/>I find both characters very plausible and likable. The guy's a hopeless romantic but resilient enough to get over heartbreak (though not before a bout of depression), and the girl's a secret romantic who hides behind her motto that she doesn't believe in love (till she finds it). And even though they have a nice romance, relationships don't always work out, often because one party is just not as into the other, and it's really no one's fault. C'est la vie and moving on. <br/><br/>And it's great that the movie ends on an appropriately positive - if not cheesy - note. Downer finales don't really befit romcoms."
"kennychaggerty","9","0","0","15 February 2010"," A New Kind of Romantic Comedy
","One of the negative aspects of most Romantic Comedies is that they appear fake. The cliché endings and the unrealistic relationships between characters are repeated in movie after movie. So after viewing (500) Days of Summer I'm relieved to say that there is now at least one film that explores the realism of relationships and break-ups. There are so many times in this movie where I could relate to the main character. I often found myself screaming out at the television, ""Oh My God the exact same thing happen to me."" The film follows the relationship between Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). According to Tom everything seems to be going fantastic and he honestly believes that Summer is the woman for him. However, after less than a year of dating she decides to end things. Tom is shocked to say the least and goes through an era of depression almost as long as the relationship was itself. Let's face it, it happens to everybody and (500) Days of Summer shows how quickly your feelings can change from being completely in love with someone to hating them beyond words. There are so many interesting scenes that each explore different aspects of relationships. For example, in one fantastic sequence the filmmaker divides the screen in half, one-side showing what Tom expects to happen and on the other side displaying what actually happens. Tom expects that Summer and him will get back together and have a romantic evening. However, in reality she simply invited him to the party just to be nice, and already had another love interest. (500) Days of Summer is unlike any other romantic comedy ever made. This is because its focus is not on presenting a feel good movie or giving the audience a happy ending, but it is to demonstrate that everyone goes through the hardships of relationships and break-ups. However, by the end of the film another realistic aspect is shown, which is we learn through the hard times and most of the time things work out for the best. Overall, if you've ever been in a relationship you should do yourself a favor and watch (500) Days of Summer. It's honest, clever, funny, and one of the best films of the year."
"MajorTom123","10","0","0","14 February 2010"," Simply the best at what it aims at
","First of all, I approached this movie having heard very mixed reviews of grandeur and failure so I did not have any expectations whatsoever.<br/><br/>All of us regular movie-buffs and especially those fans of romantic comedies (excluding me from this clique) have grown jaded with the pattern of events that is too familiar to this genre. 500DoS does something so simple as to reorganize the temporal chronology of these events which de-familiarizes the viewer with the triteness and instead reintroduces it in a mesh. Additionally, it does it extremely well - anachronous events are often organized in such a way that effectively accentuates the ""emotional roller-coaster"" that the protagonist experiences.<br/><br/>As the movie begins and the narrator exclaims that ""this is not a love story"", we enter a world which is completely fabricated and brings our attention to how much it is a movie and not reality. The initial statement is accurate - this is in fact not a love story. It is a movie that deals with the subject of love and its different facets : does love exist? is love fate? Here lies the beauty of this movie (except for Zooey Deschanel who is consistently infatuating in all her movies): it explores ""love"" in an untypically honest way for its genre in a stylistically fictional method.<br/><br/>The acting is superb of well-rounded and, most importantly, three-dimensional characters who are quirky yet believable.<br/><br/>Slap on to that some good humor and you got yourself a great movie : you'll laugh & you'll cry."
"georgekaufmann","8","0","0","10 February 2010"," After Summer comes... Autumn
","What a breeze of fresh air ""500 Days of Summer"" was to me! Finally a movie that doesn't give you the happily ever after crap from Hollywood. A lot of people, after being exposed to hundreds of romantic comedies a la Hollywood, have come to believe that there is just one right person out there for you in the whole wide world. They are obsessed with the thought of missing out on their one true soul mate. I must admit, I myself had this beautiful naive vision of love during my teen years, but like Tom Hansen (JGL) in this story, I had to learn the hard way to grow up and mature in love matters. <br/><br/>What I loved about this movie, is that the love story is told trough the eyes of the protagonist (JGL), it is ultimately the real way we experience love. Trough his eyes we get to see the ups and downs that he lives in his relationship. Take for example, the scene where he starts to sing and dance on the street after spending the night with Summer (Zooey Deschanel). It was a pure joy to watch and I could truly identify myself with him. When love hits you hard you get the feeling you are walking on a cloud. Another great example to show us his particular vision of things is the scene were the screen splits in two. He is about two enter the party of Summer and on one screen we see what his expectations are and on the other what happens in reality. This scene was precious to me, it shows you in a very plastic way the tricks that the mind can play on you. Of course the downfall is pretty hard. <br/><br/>My compliments to the two lead actors, they do a great work and the chemistry between them shows. The supporting actors also deliver very well and give some good comic relief. The soundtrack is also very beautiful and the songs help us understand the feelings of Tom Hansen. I cannot forget to mention the cinematography of the film. It includes some wonderful shots of the city of Los Angeles. I used to think of LA as a rather ugly city, but it seems I was wrong. <br/><br/>But what really deserves a special recognition is the editing in the movie. I am sure a lot of people found the back and forth in the storytelling confusing, but it was made this way for a purpose. When you think about the bad and good moments of a past relationship you will not be capable of remembering them in a straight linear way, it will all be a little mixed up, just like in this movie. <br/><br/>Well, let's don't blabber any more and jump to a conclusion. If you love the fairytale love stories this movie is not for you. But if you want to see a love story much more down to earth and take a good look on the right and wrong turns a relationship can take, this movie is for you. In the end the movie tries to tell you that life is all about grasping the right opportunities. <br/><br/>Will you make the right choice and give this movie a chance?"

","I'm really going to generally avoid spoilers, but, unfortunately, the nature of this film makes it difficult to fully discuss without spoilers. The truth is that the storyline is visible five minutes in, so you shouldn't worry about them.<br/><br/>Romance movies can go awry easily. It's easy for them to be forced, fatalistic and silly to the point of self-parody (Which isn't a problem if you intend it, but it's often unintentional.) or depressing dirges about the futility of life and love reminiscent of a poem from a recently-single teenager. Even ignoring those issues, they usually depend heavily on the performances of the leads, so that if one of the actors isn't quite up to the task the film suffers mightily. ""(500) Days of Summer"" finds ways around all of the pitfalls of romances with a level of intelligence, silliness, and feeling that is truly inspired.<br/><br/>It's pretty much the standard American film love story. The narrator tells us this right away. (He does say ""this is not a love story,"" but rather a ""boy meets girl story."") However, even before that, the hilarious opening title cards tell us that this isn't going to be taken 100% seriously. We start out with our protagonist, Tom, in a depressed state about his recently-ended relationship and then, jumping through time throughout the relationship, we get entire arc of their relationship, from meeting to demise, and a little beyond. However, it's the way in which we move through the story, knowing the end and the beginning, that holds our attention. The device of showing us which day it is outlives its usefulness after about twenty minutes, since we're really just moving among three time frames, but the structure allows us to see the relationship's development piecemeal, so that some ""mystery,"" so to speak, remains throughout. The ending is also both somewhat surprising and absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>The film's attitude of a mixture of deep emotion and pure silliness also helps it move along. When Tom is happy because he kissed Summer, we not only get him walking down the street happy, we get a full-on music video that even goes so far as to include a happy little cartoon bluebird. That scene also pays off wonderfully later when Tom finally realizes that the relationship is over and staggers into the dark streets, and our memory of that earlier instance gives it a powerful emotional punch.<br/><br/>As for the acting that is such a problem for so many romances, this film avoids that problem by (a) focusing on just one of the leads so that the other really doesn't have to do anything and (b) casting Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Gordon-Levitt has, without much fanfare, built an incredible body of work that shows him to be among the finest and most versatile actors alive, and in this film we see him trying on another new hat--being a vulnerable, insecure young man who thinks he lives in a fairy tale and then can't stand to see his sand castle get washed away. Zooey Deschanel is very pretty, but she's not a good actor. In this film, it really doesn't matter, because she has so little to do. There are a few scenes where her limitations are definitely a problem (Her final scene, her ""apology"" to Tom after he gets in the fight, and the first kiss scene come to mind.), but not enough to really get in the way of what is otherwise such an excellent film. The supporting performances are all fine but require little.<br/><br/>What little criticism I can make of the film is threefold. First, the calendar-like counting of the days really grew annoying once the time frames had been set--we knew where we were in the relationship anyway, so we didn't need that reference. Second, the narrator's presence, after introducing the story, was obtrusive and unnecessary. While we're seeing something unfold on the screen, he unnecessarily pops in to tell us what it means. This problem was most prevalent when he talked about Summer opening up her world to Tom. We could see that happening--the camera-work told us, the set told us, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt told us. We didn't need the big disembodied voice to chime in as well and it was distracting as a result. Third, Zooey Deschanel's weak performance, as mentioned above.<br/><br/>Overall, a truly excellent film that has enough humor to entertain people, a great ending, and excellent emotion."

","Well I'm sorry about this review. The real thing is, this movie is for the brokenhearted ones. I've never seen a movie so comfortable to watch in a so bad time in my life, it's like ""come on! Let's wake up for life, man! If you never loved anyone and this was your first one, you can be sure that there'll be another one"". But, It's so easy to think like that, right? In case you don't have feelings.<br/><br/>The movie simplifies everything, it shows how people wish that their love never die, how people are engaged in make their dreams of love come true... however, the reality is so cruel and besides it, there's always a hope in our hearts meaning, in some way, that everything is gonna be alright.<br/><br/>This movie is funny because it describes every and each feeling you have when the love starts until it ends, it shows that loving somebody is the worst and best thing a human can do.<br/><br/>The best of this movie is that there is no ""I love us"", it's real. In every relationship there's always difference between the love you give and the love you receive. That's the worst part of love, which, in a very smart way, is represented in (500) days of Summer. I hope everyone enjoy this movie and consider it a call for your life.<br/><br/>Do something for your love, but if you think it's just ""your love""... stop it and turnaround."

","If you are a fan of my reviews, you know one of my ultimate hatred for romantic comedies. The genre is so beyond tired, predictable and unrealistic fantasies that little girls need to tell themselves that they're going to find their prince charming one day and will live happily ever after. When 500 Days of Summer was released, I thought it was going to be the same thing, but this movie kept on getting all these great reviews, so I decided to suck it up and see what it was about. Holy God, I cannot believe there is a romantic comedy that is not only funny but extremely realistic and very well told. This is the kind of story that brings us back down to Earth, because everyone has had this type of a romance in their lives. Wither you're a realist or a hopeless romantic, this movie will work for you. The two lead actors: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel worked so well together and were just a pleasure on screen. Both characters have faults, but still remain very lovable people and are someone to relate too.<br/><br/>Tom Hansen meets Summer Finn, the new assistant to his boss. Tom trained as an architect but works as a writer at a greeting card company, living in Los Angeles. Following a karaoke night, Tom's co-worker, McKenzie, lets slip that Tom is attracted to Summer. Over the next few months Summer and Tom grow closer, despite Summer making it clear to Tom that she does not believe in true love, and does not want a boyfriend. Summer and Tom split up after they see The Graduate, a film which Tom thinks shows true love. Tom does not take the break up well, and Tom's friends call his younger sister, Rachel, to calm him down. Summer quits the greeting card company and Tom's boss moves him to consolations, as his depression is not suitable for happier events.<br/><br/>I've had my ""Summer"" and I'm sure I've been a ""Summer"" to men before, that's why I loved this movie so much. For once this was a movie that I could relate too on a lot of levels. The director took a lot of risks with this movie and I loved the way it paid off. One of my favorite shots that I've just been bragging about to my friends and family was when Tom is invited to Summer's party, he's thinking that it's because she's starting to like him again as a love interest, so the director split's the screen as ""Expectations"" and ""Reality"". Tom goes into the party with a split screen of what he is expecting as Summer is so excited to see him and they reconnect, but in his reality vision, she's happy to see him, but he realizes that it's not the kind of happy that she's loving him again. Even the supporting cast, we don't have a cliché of characters, we have real friends and family that we would have in life. 500 Days of Summer is a charming movie and such a breath of fresh air that Hollywood can still pull in original ideas and make a romantic comedy that is not only funny, but heart warming as well. The ending is guaranteed to leave a smile on your face.<br/><br/>9/10"
"kvijay-86","9","0","0","29 January 2010"," A Surprisingly Wonderful Movie!
","500 Days of Summer – The title of the movie made me visualize it as a breezy love story set in some warm sunny beach on the West Coast. The opening scene by itself was a surprise as it showed a couple holding hands, smiling silently, with the lady wearing an engagement ring, sitting on a bench in a public park with an ambiance which was far from being anything we would call sunny! More like a shot from Woody Allen's earlier works. But in this case it was not New York, but LA. From there it began. And what a ride it was.<br/><br/>500 Days of Summer The story is narrated in a non-linear fashion, but less intrusive & easier to follow than a Nolan's movie. You easily get into the flow of narration in a couple of shots. It is so wonderfully intuitive. Now let's get into the movie.<br/><br/>The speaker in the background says that this is yet another 'Boy meets a girl' movie but not a love story! You would be intrigued because how else these candy floss movies could otherwise be made. But the director adds a punch inside the movie which would strike a chord with every man in the world, one time or the other in his life The movie begins, as said before, with a couple holding hands effusing warm feelings. The very next scene throws you into the utter chaos which the lead of the movie, Tom has created. Tom is an average Greeting card writer who aspires to become an architect (which he had studied in the college) and is highly dissatisfied with his mundane job. Then comes Summer, who doesn't literally blow away Tom's life like a hurricane, but enters his world slowly. Tom feels a particular attraction towards with Summer, the first time he sees her. But Summer doesn't. She has a peculiar way of looking at things, claiming that 'true love' is an adult version of Santa and is extremely commitment-phobic. Then begins a series of courtship between the lead characters, which captures every aspect of emotional turbulence that every pair in the world goes through.<br/><br/>The ups and downs that Tom goes through in the relationship and for a lesser extent what Summer goes through is shown at such a frantic pace that you literally laugh and feel sad at the same time. The script is so fast paced, that you don't have time to feel the hangover of the previous scene. The lead characters are also well developed and you wouldn't find them behaving in clichéd ways. Humour in this movie is so subtle that you actually laugh without understanding why you are laughing in the first place! The dialogues are crisp and insightful. Some words like 'I felt something for him, which I never was sure in your case' are just so plain yet powerful. One should watch the movie carefully to appreciate these jewels.<br/><br/>The background score and other songs in the movie perfectly blend with various moods portrayed. Marc Webb's music videos background shows up clearly in this movie. The song Tom dances to when he's happy is a treat to the eyes. But gives a 'been there-seen that' feeling.<br/><br/>The same scenes revisited in different moods show different meanings. And then again all this boils down to how our mind interprets things the way it wants to see it. The expectation / reality sequence is so original and the way it is shot is simply superb. It appears that one can never best the way Tom's disappointment is shown in the movie.<br/><br/>In the climax, the movie really appears to fall into the usual cliché tic ending. But Webb pulls it back into reality and avoids the mistake so many others have made before. And in the end the movie ends in Ivan Goncharov's 'Same Old Story' fashion, where the protogonists' views of the world become interchanged(which btw is perfectly the way things turn out in the real world). Webb has artfully wefted in so many different feelings that one can possibly go through in a relationship in this compact 90 minute delight. All in all, 500 days of Summer is definitely a 'not to be missed' movie."

","I'm sure most of us have heard the term ""chick-flick"". You know the one. The movie that has the girl falling for the guy, then a dilemma develops, they fall apart, only to be brought back together by serendipity {play romantic chorus here}.<br/><br/>Well this isn't that kind of movie, thank you very much...<br/><br/>This is something newer, something I like to call ""a romantic guy flick."" No, it's not some horny dude looking to plop his thing into any attractive gal that comes along (KNOCKED UP) or some roadtrip movie gone awry (THE HANGOVER). This is a story of unrequited love ...from the man's side. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (THE LOOKOUT) stars as Tom, a guy wanting nothing more than to fall in love with the girl of his dreams. And he believes he's found her in Summer (Zooey Deschanel, THE HAPPENING). Trouble is Summer only wants to be ""friends with benefits."" She tells Tom this from the get-go, but Tom's having none of it. He believes he can turn her toward him and onto a path of blissfulness.<br/><br/>The film juxtaposes their 500 days together in a unique pattern: by traversing the days in a haphazard fashion, jumping from day 490 to day 39, then on to day 65 and back to day 1. This is representational of Tom's need to find out what went wrong with their relationship, as Summer breaks it off and devastates Tom. Or did anything go wrong? Perhaps Tom simply wasn't listening ...or being unrealistic in his expectations of Summer.<br/><br/>Whatever the reason, many lonely guys out there will probably be able to identify with ""that girl that broke my heart"" syndrome that Tom goes through. This is what makes (500) DAYS OF SUMMER the guy flick I referred to earlier. It is frustrating, funny, and downright depressing. Doubly so when we see Summer hold hands with Tom even after there is no hope for them, further confounding Tom's sense of right and ...love.<br/><br/>Even though there's a depressing air to the entire film, it does have its lighter moments thanks to two of Tom's buddies who are absolutely clueless about relationships yet offer their ridiculously bad advice to him. Tom's kid sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz) plays the sounding board and only person who seems to have a grip on what Tom really needs, which is a funny byline since she's basically a 12-year-old with the maturity level of a 20-something.<br/><br/>The movie might have ended on a very sour note, further depressing anyone watching. But, in the end, we're given a small ray of sunshine that drifts away from Summer and helps lift Tom into a new season. Perhaps Autumn will be better..."

","The strength of 500 Days of Summer is all in the telling of the story. The quirky script, and rather original format is much more beguiling than the all too regular linear romantic tale.<br/><br/>The story depicts the 500 days that Tom Hansen encounters Summer Finn and their ambiguous, unconventional and absorbing relationship. The film is partly narrated and gives 500 Days a rather comforting feel as though the Narrator is an all wise deity, indeed he inform us of the outcome of the film at the onset. The film thereafter is conveyed in a grounded but other worldly feel... If that makes sense.<br/><br/>The relationship is brought whimsically and imaginatively to life by the almost random fluttering between the 500 days. The interchange between such days never becomes tiresome. The ups-and-downs are injected with life by two great young actors. Levitt plays Tom with aplomb, and provides a subtle coolness whilst conveying the almost touchable emotional angst. Summer is much the same as Tom rather a cool chick but remains rather evasive throughout. Deschanel providing a wonderful performance by producing an enchanting aura around Summer. <br/><br/>There are some excellent moments in particular the 'Reality' and 'Expectations' scene, it is not only intriguing viewing but a raw depiction of human emotion provided in a refreshing way. The imaginative 'dance scene' conveying the joys of Tom Hansen as the first shoots of romance spring is aptly deft at providing his internal emotions. The film is intersperse with segments of music, which help glide the film along and resonate a certain connectivity to the emotions of Tom and Summer. One personal gripe was the Sweet Disposition track which plays frequently through the film. I just don't like the song.<br/><br/>I did have a few problems with the film one being the idea that Tom's young sister can provide relationship advise. Although this is rather endearing it is too quirky and mis-directed. The film also ends rather gimmicky when Tom encounters a lady at a job interview. Lastly, the film brings a rather startlingly revelation near the end of the film concerning Summer, which seemed like a last minute afterthought and had an abruptness which I wasn't keen upon.<br/><br/>500 Days of Summer is original, refreshing and excellently brought to life through the direction of Marc Webb, the novel screenplay and the great performances from Deschanel and Levitt. A film to be watched and admired for its well-structured and creative story."
"mcsheehey","10","0","0","16 January 2010"," Captures the Generation
","""(500) Days of Summer,"" seems like a simple romantic comedy from the DVD cover. It's not. It's an unconventional comedy that captures the 2000s generation.<br/><br/>""(500) Days of Summer"" is not a love story. Leads Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel don't begin the film as rivals/enemies and end it as lovers in the screwball fashion spurred by Tracy/Hepburn and company. They don't have a hot-cold romance that eventually falls through, in the Annie Hall tradition. In ""(500) Days,"" Gordon-Levitt's Tom falls head-over-heels in love with Zooey Deschanel's Summer. He doesn't have that Woody Allen ""devil may care"" attitude, where you doubt that the romance really means all that much to him. He is totally smitten. The wrench in the works is Summer. She's just not in love with Tom. Their relationship actually loses steam and fizzles out with Tom despairing and Summer.....well......feeling alright.<br/><br/>This sounds like a spoiler review, but it's not. Part of the innovation of this film is its structure. Thanks to visual cues on screen, the film jumps from day to day, whether forward or backwards. The film opens at the end of the relationship, the jumps all throughout its 500 days. This keeps the narrative fresh and interesting, and doesn't allow the sadder scenes to sink the film into depression.<br/><br/>This is THE romantic comedy for this generation. The characters are bitingly sarcastic and pop culturally-aware. Their conversations are compelling and witty, and their clothes have that undeniably ""hipster"" quality. They love ""vintage"" items, and they think.talk about profound subjects. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are perfectly cast. They play the leads with genuine humanity and interest. They shine especially in the scenes towards the end of the romance, where snappy dialogue gives way to mood swings and foreboding.<br/><br/>""(500) Days of Summer"" will assuredly becomes the basis for a new generation of tired romantic comedies, but it rises above the mold and will hopefully always be remembered as a rend-setter rather than just part of the trend. With a great soundtrack, a memorable dance sequence, and an innovative structure, ""(500) Days of Summer"" has entered the canon of the greats."

","I must first start off by saying that 500 days has one of the BEST soundtracks for a movie. Aren't you tired of all the movies these days with redundant music scores? The first thing I did after watching this, was go straight to research every single track on this movie. Regina Spektor and The Smith's made this piece of work complete. The Music is in perfect sync with every single scene! That is a very hard thing to achieve--to have perfect sound match the scene.<br/><br/>The scene with Summer's rooftop party literally put daggers through my heart with Regina Spektor's ""Hero"" . You have to be heartless to watch that scene with out feeling like you are being dumped yourself.<br/><br/>The Non-Linear Narrative style Webb and team used was a nice twist to see in a movie, cutting in and out from different days and so forth.<br/><br/>The 1960's/modern-esque fashion is great to see, cast members wearing basic beige, navy, brown etc. And the music also matched the fashion very well too...Indie Rock songs with semi-formal/modern-esque/60's clothes is a great mix.<br/><br/>**Now to the cutting edge** Although they say ""this is not a love story"" It IS indeed a love story. I think the filmmakers added that bit in there to give us some foreshadowing about how Tom became bitter through-out the movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography was great, The camera's used were very smooth...you can tell smooth camera movement when your eyes DON'T jump all over the place...but smoothly transitioning is key..especially so you don't give your audience a headache like ""paranormal activity"" Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt were perfect for this movie as well, the music and fashion also fuse to their natural poise and personality...maybe a little bit more to Zooey.<br/><br/>If I had to nit pick on something it would be the little sister who acts like an older person, that whole role just seemed awkward and forced."

"MetalAngel","10","0","0","11 January 2010"," Romantic comedies don't get any better than this!
","It's always a thrill to watch romantic comedies, because they make us feel good about life generally and because they confirm our beliefs that love is very much alive and that it can happen to anyone...even if these movies ARE absolutely fictional and carry a plot line that's as believable as The Lord of the Rings taking place in New York. This year, however, director Marc Webb has astounded us with a TRULY refreshing romantic comedy called ""(500) Days of Summer"", which is by far THE most original romantic comedy of the year, and which is not only life-affirming but which also echoes true life and which has a ring and a taste of certainty that no other film of its genre has captured.<br/><br/>The film follows Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a man who studied to be an architect but who is now suffocated in a greeting-card business that's not very motivating but which does give him easy money to earn. He's the kind of man who believes that love comes to you, that you immediately FEEL who you'll live with for the rest of your life when you meet that person. In just a few minutes, the film opens up the character of Tom in a very complete, methodical and empathic way, and by the end of these first minutes, we feel like we already know him completely and that we sympathize with whatever he'll do. Now, this likable man who believes in happily ever after meets Summer (Zooey Deschanel), an equally likable and charming girl who the audience instantly falls in love with. Despite her appealing demeanor and her irresistible personality, Summer refuses to believe in true love and is convinced that she will NEVER find a man with whom she'd like to live with, let alone marry...and like the tag-line of the movie says: ""Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."" The story is as simple as they come, but the way it's told is fresh and a pure joy to watch. Tom goes through the 500 days he's known Summer, but he doesn't do so in chronological order; scenes go madly back and forth in time, from day 275 to day 43, to 470, to day 1 and etc. This might at first seem a bit too crazy, but I ask you, who can detail the entire story of a long relationship precisely from day 1 to the last? Usually you begin somewhere and, once you start telling the story, you come back to previous events that support something else you said, right? This style of storytelling enhances the feeling of the movie and gives it the sort of 'puzzle solving' characteristic of other films. Needless to say, each scene is infused with the charm and wit of both main characters, and the days of their relationship pass through our minds, and we feel like we can savor their emotions, like their words inject life and experience into our bloodstream.<br/><br/>Summer is a wonderful girl, she really likes Tom and she's willing to be friends with him and to have an open relationship. But Tom falls in love with her every day more, she allows him to do so and we see their intimate relationship go to such depths where the only outcome could possibly be a Happy Ever After. Nevertheless their views on life and love are so different that the story always keeps us in suspense as to what the resolution may be. Tom is besotted with Summer, she refuses to give the relationship another go, and as both their views begin to clash so much, we're (the audience) sure that ANYTHING is possible. It IS a romantic comedy, but there's no way we can predict the outcome, even if it's as obvious as they come. THAT'S the wonder of the film, how it takes such a simple story and give it infinite depth and charisma to a point where you cannot help but wonder why you've never seen such a heartfelt affirmation of life and love on screen before.<br/><br/>It's a film without a single cheesy moment or without exploiting a single cliché either. It's completely new, and the charm exuded by the characters doesn't remind us of any other cinema couple. On the contrary, they remind us of ourselves, of the people we know, of true stories we've heard before. When we see them going into a karaoke bar in the movie, or when they meet at the park for a picnic, the situation, the dialogue, and the action are so REAL, so natural and so touching that you can't help but feel you know the characters personally. In a very silent and straightforward way the film engrosses you.<br/><br/>The editing is perfect, and there's just no other order to the scenes. Change the sequence of one scene with the next and the film would lose its power. The cinematography is remarkable- with a particular scene where Tom and Summer are walking and he's showing her his favorite buildings- this scene is grandiose. And there's even a Broadway-style musical number which is totally adequate, complete with a choreography and animated bluebirds à la Song of the South; there's another poignant scene that's split-screen with a dream event occurring in one side and the dark truth happening on the other; there's also interview scenes where other characters give their opinions on the topic of love. The film is all-inclusive where photographic techniques are involved, and it gives the screenplay a playful and cheery quality which mesmerizes us.<br/><br/>This film was sent from romantic comedy heaven, and it's one of the surprise best films of the year. It's sure to carve its notch among the best films of its genre ever. Go see it now! And, like every other critic has said, ignore the commas in the title; save yourself the loss of Ogdens.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!"
"diac228","9","0","0","9 January 2010"," The Charlie Brown of love tales, 500 Days of Summer is a cruelly charming and realistic look at unrequited love
","I was angry at the characters. I was angry at the way the story was progressing. I was angry because I knew of the gloom and doom that was approaching. I was angry, because, I had been there, experienced that all before. I was angry because I didn't want to see it happen to someone else. That's exactly why 500 Days of Summer works as a heart-wrenching, soul-slamming romantic dramedy. This film is realistic, funny, charming, bubbly, and just a fantastic example of superb low-budget directing complimenting the low-budget writing. The movie is also utterly realistic and cleverly original, and becomes one of the better films of 2009.<br/><br/>In this soul-draining non-love story, we follow Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as he tries to pick up the pieces of his broken heart and figure out why his on-off girlfriend (Zooey Deschanel) does not ultimately return the undeniable love he has for her. The film goes in a totally non-linear format, resembling the jumbled-yet-well-structured storytelling style of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. 500 Days of Summer never just presents the story either, there is a song-and-dance routine, a few documentary-like scenes, and even an extremely clever split-screen moment that has the expectations of Tom, and the actual reality that results. Bitterly written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, it's obvious they brought personal experiences to the table. Only real life can craft such cruel moments.<br/><br/>Chemistry is what can make or break a romantic comedy. In this case, it's not only adorable and sensual, but it's downright real to the core. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel deserve acting nominations for their work, because the chemistry they had together oozes all over the film in ways not seen often in the last decade. They are not two big major stars with epic looks falling for each other, they are down-to-earth individuals that became caught up in an awkward relationship, and their sensible mannerisms enhanced the charm and realism of the entire production. Zooey Deschanel doesn't have the Hollywood look, but her portrayal of Summer pretty much forces you to fall for her just as bad as Tom does.<br/><br/>Marc Webb, a somewhat-accomplished music video director, absolutely excels in his first feature film. He takes all the little quirks and fun techniques that are usually employed to short music videos, and sprinkles them all over the 95 minutes of seeing a relationship rise and fall. Just like Michael Gondry and Spike Jonze, the music video experience allows for him to think outside the box in presenting a cinematic story, resulting in a very original experience in terms of visuals. The best example of great direction in this movie is the superb expectation/reality sequence halfway in. And just like Jonze and Gondry, he can also catch emotion and heartbreak just as well as the most experienced. You are smiling when they are at their best, and on the verge of an emotional breakdown when you see them are their lowest. And with the roller coaster-like structure, the audience is never allowed to remain too happy or too sad for too long.<br/><br/>The narrator in the film from the very beginning warns that it is not a love tale. This couldn't be any closer to the truth. It's a gut-wrenching story, and it is a tale that we all experience. Finding what we think is The One, only to see her (or him) slipping away in favor of someone else. And like I said before (in a subtle manner), this movie avoids the Hollywood clichés and does deliver on its hurtful promises. You don't see a happy ending in the distance, yet yearn for one.<br/><br/>Where the movie hits the toughest note is the third act. For a movie that takes its time in presenting the highs and lows of the relationship, we are left with a very empty conclusion. Not all the questions were answered, and not all is explained. In a film that runs so deep in the beginning, it's rather disappointing to hit shallow waters towards the end. But maybe this is the intention. Are we ever meant to truly understand why something doesn't work? Are there cases in which there is no explanation, it's just that the relationship just never ""clicked?"" Can we ever truly learn from a failed relationship that has an abrupt ending? <br/><br/>Just like Tom and Summer in the beginning of the movie, our connection with the film and the relationship suddenly gets cut off with no explanation, leading to an ending that rushes right in. Maybe it is our personal duty to dwell, to learn, to figure it out, and to move on with the knowledge intact. I never see myself being satisfied at an abrupt ending (See: No Country For Old Men), but 500 Days of Summer gets the pass because the film itself is such a satisfying and practical representation of our relationships with people—even when we are not ready for the end.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 500 Days of Summer is a beautiful film, no doubt about it. It's a brutally realistic story and an overall overwhelmingly charming experience that takes us through the highs and lows in life when sharing them with that current special someone. Besides the questionable ending, this movie has very few flaws thanks to excellent direction, excellent chemistry, and writing that sting the heartstrings like needles. If you are trying to mend new (or old) wounds (*raises hand*), this is the right film to watch to begin (or continue) the healing process. This film is not a love story, but it is indeed a story to fall in love with. Highly recommend."

","Plain and simple, (500) Days of Summer was of the most entertaining and revolutionary films to come out in the year 2009. Entertaining because it managed to combine witty humour with a story-line that audiences could both relate and fall in love with. And revolutionary because it took us on an all too familiar romantic ride in a non-linear fashion that allowed it to seem like something we had never seen before. Cinematically the movie is beautiful. Whether it be the use of a split screen, a transition into a sketch, or a dated film, every scene managed to captivate me in a new way. And it managed to do all of this without getting itself classified as one of those 'artistic' films best enjoyed by only a specific audience. Performance wise the movie was once again incredible. There is no denying that it was a bold move to cast both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as the leads in this film. Despite both having a credible history of films, neither had been given the opportunity to carry a film like they had to in (500) Days of Summer. Given this deserved opportunity, they both flourished. Joseph managed to create a character that was both easily relatable for the male audience, and innocently attractive to female viewers. Zooey, like Joseph, gave a performance filled with such realism, that viewers automatically found themselves in love with Summer Finn. In summation, (500) Days of Summer was one of the most inspirational films I have seen in quite some time, and it came from a genre I thought inspiration was not possible in - romance. If you have not seen it yet, I recommend you take the time to see this film, as every element of it, right down to its soundtrack will captivate you."

","It is and it isn't. While the movie claims upfront that it's not a love story (tongue-in-cheek fashion) it is. There isn't even anything particularly unconventional about it, only keener insight.<br/><br/>It is all too easy to be distracted by the not so avant-garde temporally scrambled narration style, starting with Tom's lamenting of his break-up with Summer, and random flashbacks showing scenes in the last 500 days. While it is tempting, it does not worth your effort to try to mentally re-arrange these scenes in proper time sequence to see if the whole thing makes sense. It makes sense anyway, because our mind flashes back randomly, just as Tom's is in the movie.<br/><br/>The focus must be on Summer. Tom, played adorably by empathy-winning Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a perfectly normal young man with normal idealising of love and romance. One could say that the real start of the movie is an office party when a challenge, albeit subconscious, is throw by Tom to Summer that true love exists. The temptation to succumb to cliché is quickly taken care of by telling the audience that both have divorced parents – so forget about that traumatic childhood experience stuff.<br/><br/>Summer obviously doesn't believe in true love and is perfectly honest about it. The attraction of Tom is that he is fun to be with. No more, and certainly no less. It's interesting to note that both of them, on separate and very different occasions, have said the same thing: you are happy, I am happy, so why care about anything else? But the subtexts are polarised opposites. For Tom, it's something like ""the future will take its course as our relationship develops and deepens"". For Summer, there is no future.<br/><br/>So what kind of a girl is summer? The audience sits through the entire movie trying to figure out (as Tom does), what makes her tick. Played to almost perfection by Zooey Deschanel, Summer is unlike any of the familiar personas such as sweet thing Meg Ryan, sharp wit Reese Witherspoon or lovable neurotic Sandra Bullock. Deachanel is the sort of actor that attracts your attention without having to do much, as she did in a small part, a guitar strumming teacher in ""Bridge to Terabithia"" (2007). Summer is independent, sensible, honest, fun to be with (yes, she too) but at the same time there is a wall behind which she is hiding something about herself deep down, as Tom puts it. There are only two points in the movie when we get a glimpse of her: when she tells Tom about her childhood fears and aspirations (something she intimated that she never told any body before) and at the Movie ""The graduate"", the only time we see her tears (but she never quite explained why).<br/><br/>Enough said. This movie should be left to the audience to experience, discover and enjoy. At times, you think you have come tantalizingly close to the simple question I posed about summer ""What makes her tick"". But in the end, it will be left to each viewer's own interpretation."

The cinematography was great and had a really nice tone to it. Now that I have finished all the good things about this movie now on to all the bad. This movie has absolutely no plot - it feels like someone aimlessly walking around for a couple of hours and then sits down for an ending. This movie is completely dead & devoid of any emotion.

In the end I couldn't take more than 20 minutes of this movie. As a last resort I tried to skip ahead in hopes that it will pick up. All I got was 2 more minutes of lame dialog.

Is that really Los Angeles? I wondered every other minute. I have seen downtown L.A., but I have never seen it like that in a movie. All clichés of Southern California are avoided, even in the wedding scene that probably takes place in Santa Barbara (given the train ride and its direction). No beaches, no athletic bodies in sexy outfits, no suntans, hardly any palm trees. Even the final scene, though representing the quintessential cliché happy ending and featuring the only female of outstanding beauty, looks unfamiliar because of its setting in that vintage office building. There is something New-Yorkish about this movie. Some have likened it to Woody Allen, maybe for a reason, but Tom is not really a Woody Allen character--he makes no reference to the Nazis, for instance, and if he is Jewish, it does not matter."

","Did Tom Hansen(Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) misread ""The Graduate"" not once(as a wide-eyed child raised on the songs of Morrissey/Marr), but twice(as a self-deluded adult still wallowing in teenaged idealism), who in both instances, gets the counterfactual notion that Benjamin Braddock(Dustin Hoffman) and Elaine Robinson(Katherine Ross) will end up together, contrary to the young couple's reticence at the back of the bus. After watching the high romance of Ben's glass-banging at the church that was holding Elaine's wedding, Tom saw what he wanted to see, and never reorientates himself to the calm after the commotion, in which the moment of undying love quickly dissolves by the time both the graduate and the runaway bride find their seats. And then he might have played something by The Smiths as reinforcement of his identification with the wildly-in-love Benjamin. Tom was young. But years later, in a greeting card company boardroom, Tom wakes up from his romantic stupor, and accuses, in particular, pop music and film, of conspiring to break our hearts with an idealism that doesn't transcend its artistic boundaries. Before this epiphany, however, Tom meets Summer(Zooey Deschanel) and he loves her, just flat out loves her. And even though a grown man should know better, Tom is still a hopeless romantic, so he projects the crazy adolescent love expressed in a couplet like ""and if a double-decker bus crashes into us/to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die""(from The Smiths' ""There Is A Light That Never Goes Out""), onto the bus that transports the distracted couple at the end of the Mike Nichols film, when the truth couldn't be any more self-evident. This misreading of ""The Graduate"" comes back to haunt Tom, late in ""(500) Days of Summer"", as life imitates art, in a scene where the greeting card writer finds himself on a bus with Summer after attending a wedding(a co-worker's wedding). With the memory of having seen ""The Graduate"" with Summer still fresh in his mind, Tom confuses expectations with reality, and takes her willingness to sleep against his shoulder as a sign of reconciliation, of love. It's the movie in his head where Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross live happily ever after, come to life; somehow ignoring the fact that ""The Graduate"" had made Summer weep and was the catalyst for their break-up. <br/><br/>Since ""(500) Days of Summer"" is devised in a non-linear fashion, when Tom shows up at Summer's party, the audience is unaware that he had a second chance at rectifying his original childhood interpretation of 1967 love, incidentally, the summer of love, as the diegesis goes split screen, expressing in formal terms, Tom's expectations(shaped by his naive readings of ""The Graduate""), and Tom's reality(shaped from a corrective reading that his adult self never made, which would comply with the consensus reading of ""The Graduate""). Fueled by love songs from the ""creme de la creme"" of post-punk bands who rose to prominence during the mid-to-late-eighties, Tom envisioned Ben and Elaine as soulmates, in spite of the overwhelming evidence that they were not built to last. To him, ""There Is A Light That Never Goes Out"" is practically a commandment that lovers stay in love. But at the shindig, Summer breaks this commandment irreparably, when Tom sees his one and only showing off her engagement ring to a friend, causing the ""reality"" side to push the ""expectations"" side out of frame, right to left. It's the same direction that Ben takes on the moving airport walkway, famously, in the opening scene of the Nichols film, famous because most filmic movement goes left to right. Now that Tom has finally grown up, he stops espousing his belief in fate and predestination that lives inside the pop song, which had kept him in a perpetual state of adolescence. Now he knows why Summer cried at the end of ""The Graduate"". Elaine didn't love Ben. If Tom conceded the truth on this matter, he'd have to admit that Summer didn't love him too. Played by Zooey Deschanel, it's plain to see why Tom had kept his Smiths goggles on to induce a state of vertigo, because who would want summer to end with a woman like that?"

This movie is the most realistic love story that has ever been. It's brilliantly done, it's creative and the way the relationship was shown almost from beginning to end was so different and it worked so well, I have no complaints for this movie. It's a classic.
Actually I have one complaint, the scene where Joseph Gordon Leavitt quits his job is a bit much. I liked it. But to me it kinda broke out of the realistic mold that the rest of the movie followed. But I mean that's a bit picky complaint that means nothing."

2. Unrealistic Characters
Summer Finn doesn't exist in reality. She's such a fantasy: even promiscuous women love to be relationship and feel being loved. In reality, guys are the ones who don't commit, use women for sex only, and move on to the next girl.
In men's fantasy, who doesn't like to have non-commital, non-consequential, free sex with a beautiful and hot girl?
Summer Finn is seen as emotionless and manipulative. However, there are subtlies which betray her emasculated character.
a. She doesn't believe in relationship and love because of her divorced parents, which means she is capable of having negative emotions.
b. She enjoys goofy things and fun people, which means she is capable of having positive emotions.
c. She spends lots of time with Tom, which means she is capable of having emotions.

","The film ""(500) Days Of Summer"" is an emotional driven Drama that centers around the life of Tom. Tom is fascinated with Summer who just moved to Los Angeles from Michigan. His fascination is at times cute, however, one can come to the conclusion that he is obsessed with Summer or that he has attachment issues. He clearly displays this when he finds out Summer is engaged to the man she met at the store. However, this may slip as you will feel heartbroken with Tom and blame everything on Summer, but shouldn't he have taken a hint? Summer was clearly hinting that this was not ever going to work since the beginning and finally told him in the very last scene of the film ""What I was never sure of with you."" This film displays relationships and how they are never truly perfect. I would recommend this film to anyone who is or has been heartbroken."
"erikamikacic","5","1","2","11 April 2016"," meh
","It wasn't that good of a movie. I wouldn't have missed out on anything if I hadn't watched it. Zooey Deschanel wasn't ""crystallized"" as a character, she was too casual and I couldn't make a connection to her. Joseph Gordon Levitt mostly just looked at her lustily. The relationship with the the guy and his friends was typical, them talking about the girl he likes. Zooey being all mysterious... This is one of those movies that's supposed to be different from the typical rom com, since - spoiler - they don't end up together again in the end. But it's the same thing, just a different packaging. The so called ""rebel"" rom-com. My favorite thing about this movie is that it got me thinking about labels in relationships and knowing where you stand. I was closer to Summer's view on the subject- to just enjoy spending time with people, from one encounter to the next. To not have to commit yourself to concepts of boy/girlfriend. But then again, I like consistency just as the guy does. if you think of someone as your boy/girl friend, that means you expect certain things from them. It's an established concept, you have to be willing to meet the other person half way in things and to make compromises or else it's not gonna work out. if you want to feel the reassurance of having a bond with someone, you have to know that you'll feel as much pain as you do pleasure. Everything you've been given has the power of being taken away from you as well. I agree that you never know how things will end up, even if you legally seal the relationship in marry. Even then you can also wake up one day and realize you don't want it anymore, or you could gradually realize it. The difference is you'll probably spend more time trying to make it work and fix it. It'll be harder and more painful to break it off. So, in the end it isn't JUST about putting a corny label on something, it's about making someone know what you mean to them and what you're willing to do for them. it's about reassurance. Casual can turn into acting casual pretty quick, so as not to get your feelings hurt. there's a casual phase in most relationships.. but if you want to feel something more exciting, you got to level up. that means more disappointment and all that stuff too. anyways, i found it unrealistic how the two of them kept randomly meeting each other throughout the movie. i wish there was more intentional meetings or phone calls after the break up. what the guy (sorry, i forgot his name) experienced after summer, she probably did with another guy before him. he got his expectations crushed and gave up on love himself. summer after getting married made him realize that both notions were too extreme. soul mates, love at first sight, fate and all that fairytale stuff is unrealistic as well as not believing in love at all or daring to bond with someone. she found middle ground i guess. i'm glad the guy decided to approach the woman who was interviewing for the same job as him. i like how the idea of fate was crushed. to me, fate is a lot about just letting stuff happen to you, because what happens will happen and some things are just meant to be. i don't like that attitude because you'll end up waiting too much instead of taking things into your own hands. sure, everything comes full circle but it's a matter of time. do you want to just sit and do nothing, wait for stuff to happen to you and for people to approach you, or do you want to feel in control of your life? that's why i'm glad the guy initiated something with the girl. i thought it was kind of corny that her name's autumn, and then day 1 again. but that's just me, i see how it makes sense."

"tbeyle","8","1","2","17 October 2014"," (500) Days of Manic Pixie Dream Girl
","""This is a story of boy meets girl. But you should know up front, this is not a love story."" (500) Days of Summer could pass as a typical romantic comedy about the average American boy and girl, but it is not. It has a rather routine structure to it: boy meets girl, boy and girl have conflict, boy desperately wants girl back. Boy, or Tom Hansen in this case, is quite ordinary and girl, Summer Finn, is absolutely not. Summer Finn can be labeled a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, a quirky and too unreal girl whose main purpose is to liven up the life of the plain male protagonist. The MPDG has been seen in many films, Elizabethtown for instance, but (500) Days seeks to look further. (500) Days of Summer is a film that is clever enough to trick audiences into thinking that they are seeing a film about a man finding the right woman. But it unpeels the next layer and shows how the male protagonist is the one to blame. It certainly succeeds in being entertaining and providing interesting commentary for audiences to unravel. It is witty and captivating. Would it be an insult to call (500) Days a romantic comedy, a rom-com? One of its first lines is a warning: it is not a love story. But there is no alternative genre for a boy who falls for a girl and spends about half of the film wallowing in his heartache. It is different than the usual rom-com. (500) Days is reminiscent of Annie Hall in its quirky humor, but still a romantic comedy. They also both have rather opinionated, outspoken male protagonists who are less interesting than their female love interest. It can be grouped with other movies similar to Annie Hall. (500) Days does stand on its own. It is not a romantic comedy that will simply blend in with the rest, which is a feat for Marc Webb and the other filmmakers. Romantic comedies have garnered a certain, not flattering, reputation over the years and one that shines bright against the rest is a true triumph. This film is even more impressive considering it is Marc Webb's feature film directing debut. (500) Days has the feel of someone who has been practicing the craft of romantic comedies, or feature films in general. In comparison to his other works, including music videos and the recent The Amazing Spider-Man films, this film is not too dissimilar. Marc Webb has an undeniably distinct style. (500) Days has a brightness and a colorfully appealing quality that seems to be Marc Webb's specialty. His films look like reality, only amplified and almost romanticized. If one were looking to merely sit back and enjoy a romantic comedy, they could watch this film and feel content. There's the initial meeting of the two love interests, their rocky road as a couple (and as a non-couple) and then a resolution that appears to be a happy one. But the commentary of this film is lurking there, waiting to be picked up on. This film seeks to challenge the term MPDG. While Summer is undoubtedly one, she is more than that. Summer is a person who is complex and not just there to make Tom's life more vivid. Tom holds on to an image of Summer and likes her to be one way. He enjoys her company when she is bubbly and peculiar and keeps him on his toes. But she has more than one side to her and it is hard for Tom to deal with. This film goes farther than to simply say that just because someone shares unique interests with you, that doesn't make them your soul mate. Although, that is an important note for the audience. The film is about love and how we spend too much time focusing on our ideal significant other. But it also takes on the task of dismantling the concept of MPDG. This film deserves a solid A-. While the film is almost flawless, I had issue with the way this film arced. Summer is essentially the antagonist to Tom's protagonist as the film goes along and she has a clear moment when she arcs. The film's climax is when Tom and Summer meet up after her wedding. She has matured and has learned about love and life. ButTom? Does he truly learn anything by the resolution of this film? I would say no, he has not learned a lesson. This seems to be a routine for Tom: he falls for a girl and then ends up heart-broken and then finds someone to lust after again. So after his final meet-up with Summer, the audience is left to wonder if he has learned from his experience with Summer. The ending of the film involves him meeting and having a brief moment of connection with a woman. She reveals her name is Autumn and he looks to the camera with a knowing smile. It seems as if the cycle is simply beginning again. The addition of Tom's younger sister was another part of the film that I thought was not necessary. She was far too precocious to be believable. But this film is worth a watch and even a re-watch. The cinematography of this film is absolutely brilliant. The city becomes its own character with beautiful views of the architecture, arguably Tom's true love. The contrast of happy times and sad times through the cinematography is well done. Tom's happier times with Summer have a pastel blue tint that livens up the movie, while Tom's melancholy scenes are gray and darker. The social commentary of the film is a major aspect that makes the film stand apart from many other films. But the conflict is debatably the best part of this film. Tom and Summer's roller coaster of a relationship is engaging. Their moments of happiness make audiences dread the upcoming demise of their relationship, but their conflict is undeniably entertaining to watch."

However, in the world, there are many kind of ""love"" and we can't choose what is the best. It's my impression of this movie. Also, Zooey Claire Deschanel, she played Summer in this film is good. She played a woman well who is very pretty and very vague. Finally, about title of this movie, ""500 days of Summer(500 nichi no sama^)"", is ""love of during only summer"".

"dom-lerose-8","Null","1","2","12 August 2014"," ""500 Days of Summer"" is a great look at relationships and the best romantic comedy of the decade!
","Being in a relationship with someone you love can be one of the most exhilarating and stressful parts of life. The bond between two people is a relationship so unique and intriguing that cinema has been putting it out to us for years. In Marc Webb's delightful and truthful ""500 Days of Summer"" we see an almost unique but yet typical relationship between two ordinary people. Joseph-Gordon Levitt plays Tom, an average card-company employee who one day sees the girl of his dreams, Summer (Zoey Deschannel)and immediately falls in love and forms a relationship with her. The two experience times of joy and stress as they spend a time experiencing and sharing the world together. The writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H.Weber due a perfect job portraying what being in a committed relationship in your early years is like by showing all dynamics that are faced when being with someone. They use enough humor and drama for balancing the story and show different aspects of Tom and Summer's relationship to not make us completely irritated by hearing Tom and Summer repeat the same parts of a relationship, but rather have a diverse story that allows both characters to be put into different situations and show different sides of each other. ""500 Days of Summer"" is a film that can help anyone in a struggling relationship, because there is something everyone who has ever dated anybody can relate to from first meeting someone, to breaking up and to having the time of your life in the company of someone beautiful. Joseph-Gordon Levitt's character of Tom is one of the most relatable and likable characters you'll ever experience and Levitt nails every characteristic of playing such a sweet role. Tom will make you feel for him in every heartfelt moment. However, the question that can be raised is whether you'll like Summer. Tom being the lead shows what it's like being in a relationship with someone, but we never really see what Summer's perspective is, which is great because she isn't a likable character and isn't supposed to be focused on. With her tough personality, we get to see Tom flow through a relationship and get his perspective of his situation, allowing us to appreciate his wonderful character. ""500 Days of Summer"" is a rom-com that doesn't try to hard or do anything typical when it comes to this genre. Instead, it is a well-made and moving masterpiece that is a reflection of what being in a relationship is like and is a cinematic poem."
"reversingtime","7","1","2","16 May 2014"," Solid take on love in the real world
","Right about 5 minutes into the movie and you are already acquainted to the personalities of both the protagonists - Tom and Summer played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel respectively and the plot of how Tom who was just dumped by Summer feels so naturally inclined to get her back since it his belief that she is the one. And as a viewer you can't help wonder if this going to be another romantic comedy which winds up the way most do, with an happy ending, where boy finally proves to the girl beyond every reasonable doubt that he and she are meant for each other. <br/><br/>But nope that doesn't quite happen. And neither does it end in tragic manner either. What happens however is a story of how love pans out in the real world. A story, as the narrator would have you know right in the beginning, of love and yet not a love story. The real plot here being of the many topsy-turvy stages of love Tom encounters in his relationship with Summer over the course of 500 days. What is really ironic about this movie is that even though it portrays love in all its delight and desperation it still manages to be a feel good movie. <br/><br/>The story which mainly focuses on the perspective of Tom who is head over heels for his dream girl would probably be a disappointment for viewers looking for lots of laugh, as the humor comes in at pace where you can't actually remember when was the last time the movie made u so much as to smile at its comedy. It was essentially a light drama and an even much lighter comedy. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance of Tom was masterclass as he really managed to morph himself into the character seamlessly. Zooey's performance on the other hand seemed to have been a leaf taken out from the book of her acting credential in New Girl. I have to say though that i wasn't really impressed with the supporting casts but who can be excused on the count that their acting time is pretty limited. Not mention, the movie's artistic displays ( from the cinematography to the editing) has been a real pleasure to watch. In short I'd say that I definitely recommend this a watch."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","13 January 2014"," Breath of fresh air in the romantic comedy scene
","""This is not a love story. This is a story about love.""<br/><br/>That is the slogan for the film and it's very accurate. (500) Days of Summer is not a typical romantic comedy in that you can pretty much predict how it's going to end from the very first minute. It's cleverer than that, always keeping you guessing and not revealing its cards until it absolute has to. It would have been easy for this film to fall into a confusing mess and to be unbearable to watch because it tried to be too clever and unconventional. Luckily the writing here is razor sharp and director Marc Webb keeps the film admirably on course even when the plot jumps uncontrollably from one place or scene to another. But this jumping has a strategy behind it, and this is one of those non-chronological films where it doesn't feel convoluted or unnecessary to watch the scenes in the ""wrong"" order.<br/><br/>Huge props should also go the leading actor and actress. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a great everyman, a guy who has lost his way in life and is content just to go on, living his days one at a time. And then a woman walks into his life and what a woman Zooey Deschanel plays. She is perfect for this film's needs, naturally playing a girl that's charming and quirky enough that it's almost too easy to fall for her at first sight, yet you get the idea that she wouldn't be that good of a wife if you were to marry her.<br/><br/>I also rather like the art style for this film. The director takes time to conduct small experiments with certain scenes, like he's still trying to find his own niche, and while this would usually make the film seem way too artsy, it works here, because there's still an undercurrent of effort. Different experiments feel like they have been thought through and instead of stealing focus away from the main storyline and the movie as a whole, they add to it. Very nice looking piece of film making in general.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is a film I'd recommend to anyone, who doesn't exactly like romantic comedies, but wants to give them a shot. It's quirky and unique enough that you won't get bored even if you think you've already seen all there's to see, yet it remains true to its genre enough that you get what you came looking for."

Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry together and give solid performances. They relationship feels real and makes you care for both of them.<br/><br/>The movie makes a great job of mixing humor and sadness . It shows the beautiful and ugly sides of love. It's a good thing that the story isn't told in a linear way . It makes a point how we want to remember some good things and how we intentionally forget about bad things. The editing is really good . The movie is quite nicely photographed. The direction by Mark Webb is full of life. The scene with Gordon Levitt walking around to Hall and Oates ""You make my dream"" is AWESOME.<br/><br/>The film shows the good and the bad of love, relationships, and life. It ends realistic . It's very funny and very sad at times movie . It's cute movie and great debut for Marc Webb. I recommend it for everyone, especially for people who don't necessary like romantic comedies (like me).

Tom(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) believes in true love but doesn't feel like he'll ever be happy in his life. When Summer (Zooey Deschanel) walks into his life, Tom suddenly realizes the woman of his dream has just walked into his life. Summer is one who doesn't believe in the existence of true love... and it is evident early and late into the film.<br/><br/>You witness Summer coming around to Tom, but heartache only persists. Inconsistent behavior from Summer lead to frustration. It's all something we felt at one point in our lives. It is heartbreaking to watch Tom teach Summer how to fall in love, yet she never takes hold. She runs the show while the foolish boy comes following along, perhaps knowing deep down the ultimate fate between the two. I am sure we all have done that at some point.<br/><br/>I can't say enough of this movie. This is great film. A true take on love. It also has taught me, life goes on. For those who are down in the dumps watch this movie, it just might teach you a valuable lesson on love. It did for me."

","As a guy and movie lover, I view romantic films as a waste of time and a film genre that I'll never touch. Following a typical cliché that combines with an uninteresting tale of boy meets girl or the other way around that is overused and uninteresting. However, what separates this film with other romantic stories is the realistic take of a boy meets girl and presents this in a manner where even a guy like me can enjoy. <br/><br/>While this movie is not exactly a break-up film or the typical romantic comedy film, I really liked the story of this film. As said earlier, It is a simple boy meets girl that portrays this in a realistic manner that shows the highs of being in a relationship and the lows of being dumped or separated from your love. What helped boost the story and fascinating was the storytelling. In easier terms, the film presents a yin-yang type of storytelling; one moment you will see Tom filled with joy and enjoying life as he is with Summer, then the story will jump to a different time where Tom is depressed, then the film repeats this process. Watching this is never annoying and succeeds in telling a good story, making it compelling. <br/><br/>Every actor and actress were perfectly well casted and portrayed their characters very well. Every character, especially the minor characters have at least something funny to present. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom and Zooey Deschanel as Summer were great. You can definitely buy the chemistry between these two as you watch their relationship bloom as they are together. I like the fact that the director didn't make Tom the ultimate good guy, making you question his actions that led him to this situation. The beginning will make you think that Summer is evil, but as you watch the film, you begin to realize the flaws and mistakes that Tom had made and will understand the reason of the breakup. <br/><br/>What surprised me most about the movie was the humor since I found myself laughing throughout various moments in the film. There are conversations, interactions and dialogue between the characters that succeeds in bringing laughter to anyone who enjoys the plot. Although you do not see them a lot, personally, Tom's friends really helped bring the humor to some scenes. They were never annoying, didn't outshine any of the cast and were great as you see them on screen. Their conversations really reminds me of my discussion with my best friend that leads up to answers and conclusions that is similar to what these characters say in the film; may sound weird, but it worked for me. <br/><br/>In the end, I ended up liking this film more than I expected. Bringing a realistic take on romance and to present it with good humor, great acting and likable characters really made this film fun to watch."

","I heard quite a lot about this film at the time of its release, many sources saying that it was something to be watched, but I had no idea about the concept, so I was very intrigued while viewing it. Basically Tom Hansen (Inception's Golden Globe nominated Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has recently broken up with Summer Finn (Yes Man's Zooey Deschanel), and the film is a backwards-forward various order charts their relationship. Tom trained as an architect, but works making greeting cards, and Summer was the new assistant to his boss, and it was Tom's friend and co-worker McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) who helped set them up and start dating. Over the next few months they got closer, but obviously the film being so mixed with ordering of their love there are the moments that show how they started breaking apart as well. Summer did not originally believe that true love existed, and Tom fell over heels for her, and after just over two hundred days together their first argument comes from a bout of jealousy. They do eventually break up, Tom finds it hard to take and has depression, and Summer quits her job to move on, but they see each other again at a co-worker's wedding, and she is surprised to catch the bouquet. They start to become friends again, but he is devastated to see that she is wearing an engagement ring, and after a long bout of deeper depression, scoffing on junk food and alcoholism, he has an outburst at work, and quits. A long time passes, and Tom and Summer see each other again at his favourite spot on the park bench, and they really talk things through, they make up with each other before going their separate ways. So in the end Summer did find true love, just with someone else, even though she did have a lovely relationship with Tom, and he meanwhile twelve days later finds a new girl to ask on a date, her name is Autumn (Minka Kelly). Also starring Kick-Ass's Chloë Grace Moretz as Rachel, Matthew Gray Gubler as Paul, Clark Gregg as Vance, Patricia Belcher as Millie and Rachel Boston as Alison. Gordon-Levitt is a good looking likable guy, and Deschanel is as usual is beautiful, kooky and lovable, you could think of this film as a faster paced and softer Pulp Fiction or Memento with this style of editing, it does make for some interesting scenes, it may confuse you a little bit, but actually doing it the regular order would be a bit boring, so all in all it is a good fun and nice alternative romantic comedy. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Very good!"

","Reviewing my favorite movie of all time is insanely challenging. Mostly because I don't know what to write about and how much to leave for you to find out. Anyway, I will give it a try simply because this is an amazing movie and shockingly few people have even heard about it. I feel morally obligated to do this! Synopsis : Tom Hansen, played by JGL, is a greeting card writer and is convinced that there is a difference between believing in true love and Santa Claus. Summer Finn, played by Zooey, joins the greeting card company and hits it off with Tom. In between songs performed by Simon & Garfunkel, The Smiths, Regina Spektor and even Carla Bruni, Tom lives through 500 days, some with and some without Summer. No spoilers here since the film's tagline itself reads out, ""Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl Doesn't"".<br/><br/>What's Good : Right during the film's opening, the narrator sets up the intrigue by clarifying, ""This is a movie about Boy meets Girl. But you should know upfront – this is not a love story."" The movie does not always move in chronological order, which is a very clever screenplay device for portraying pre and post-Summer Tom. The leads are charming and very convincing as twenty-somethings not sure of what they're looking for in life, or love. Their characters are disarmingly likable, have their endearing quirks – and I will go out on a limb and say that its impossible to not fall in love with them. Also of note is the music featured throughout the movie – mostly 60s and 70s British pop but also newer, little known bands like Mumm-Ra, Doves and Temper Trap. Oh and there's also an amazingly choreographed little dance number on JGL.<br/><br/>Whats not : Tom's younger sister, played by, Chloe Grace Moretz plays on the wise-beyond-her-years cliché for far too long.<br/><br/>There are many things unique to this movie. This, to me, was the most humorous movie of the last 5 years and yet it didn't seem forced like The Hangover. And yet, before the climax its hard to not feel for Tom. There are also a couple of scenes (one being ""expectations v/s reality"") which portray things each one of us goes through everyday and its amazing how well its been played out in the movie.<br/><br/>It has a lot of similarities with High Fidelity (break-up movie, 70s music, hero is interested in architecture etc), which is another stupendous rom-com but this one's more grown-up and subtle.<br/><br/>Verdict : You will either really like it or you may really hate it :) My Rating : 10/10"
"easye115","10","1","2","30 January 2012"," Unexpected Hit!
","500 days of Summer is one of those films you don't really know what to expect from. When you actually take the chance and watch it, you wonder, 'why can't I watch more movies like this?' This, after having to wake up at 6am, not having anything to do and coming across this on one of the lower end cable networks. Interesting, because this film actually is based on the idea that 'love' is all about your fate, about being at the right place at the right time. There may be moments where you do not believe that, but after watching the entire film, you really do believe it. Many kudos to Marc Webb for directing such a smart film, for Joseph Gordon-Levitt on continuing to be the wonderful actor he is."
"itamarscomix","6","1","2","14 January 2012"," Pandering to the Hipsters
","Straight out of the Juno school of filmmaking, here's another bitter- sweet, off-beat romantic comedy with a quirky, off-beat girl, an ironic sense of humor mixed with sweet romanticism, and tons of cultural references and name-dropping from Ringo Starr to Ingmar Bergman to Oscar Wilde, a sure way to appeal to young proto-intellectuals and hipsters. <br/><br/>It works, to a certain degree, especially thanks to two very effective leads. Having had my own little celebrity-crush on Zooey Deschanel ever since her short but unforgettable performance in Almost Famous almost a decade ago, it was easy to relate to the character portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who's growing up to be quite a decent actor by his own right, even if he still looks sixteen (I was hoping to see some stubble in the scene in which he's depressed and doesn't leave his bed for a week, but nada).<br/><br/>500 Days of Summer has a lot going for it, and a lot of the right elements are in place, but it doesn't achieve real greatness, not even mild and humble greatness like that of solid, intelligent romantic comedies (Jerry Maguire, When Harry Met Sally, High Fidelity etc.) It's just not that memorable, and stylistic elements like the non-linear storytelling serve mainly the purpose of being cool and contemporary than any real one. And even though the actors are great and they do their best, they do it with characters that aren't very complex to begin with. It's an enjoyable movie, and a fantastic date-movie for a couple of young cynics, but it's not one that will stick with you for long."

","I cried 3 times while watching this movie. It blows me away every time I see it. No words in the English or Spanish dictionary could ever comprehend how much I absolutely adore this movie! Every aspect is perfect. I fit right in with the main character and I'm sure billions of others do to. They spend so much delicate time showing us how important the relationship was, making all the darker moments seem more engaging and all the happier moments all the more enjoyable. I found myself dancing around with it at one moment then literally the next minute being thrown back in a pit of despair. Needless to say the movie ends on a great note and every time I watch it it takes my breath away. It's so creative, so uplifting, so utterly enjoyable that there's no reason it shouldn't be my favorite movie. And it is! 500 Days of Summer is hands down the best movie I've ever seen. I watch all kinds of things, from gore-filled movies like ""Pulp Fiction"" to masterpieces of acting and drama like ""Citizen Kane."" Then this absolute gem of a romance movie comes out of nowhere with such originality and creativity and hits me in the face like a truck going 90! If you haven't seen this movie then shame on you. It's a must watch in my book and will remain that way for probably as long as I live, and I still got a hearty 65 years to go! <br/><br/>Thank you 500 Days of Summer for being so Incredible."
"theinaniloquent","10","1","2","2 October 2011"," ""This is not a love story. This a story about love""
","An offbeat romantic comedy about a woman who doesn't believe true love exists, and the young man who falls for her.<br/><br/>WOW. I came into watching the film with no expectations, and expecting another cheesy, flimsy romantic comedy but got so much more... The film structures by skipping through the days of a couple's relationship. You get to see the start, the happy days of their relationship, and when the feelings start to fade. You also get to see the most depressing parts, the aftermath. The interesting part is that the film doesn't move around in chronological order, it skips around to the most important parts. I loved this, and it added to the uniqueness of the film. The acting in this film was unbelievable. Joseph Levitt is a fantastic actor, playing roles in 50/50 and Hesher. He surprises us in each role, but this one captures realism more than others. The most surprising was probably Zooey Deschanel 's acting. She is a witty girl, playing a role in the new hit show New Girl, and I never suspected real acting from her. But she plays a realistic approach without overdoing it like most other actors. The supporting cast was great too, and I had no criticism in this department... The screenplay was actually handed really well. The humor was not laugh-out-loud funny, but it was actually real. The jokes and stuff were funny, but in a witty kind of way. They are fast-paced and keep coming, just like real life... That leads me to the next part, how REAL this is. I think the film is better if you have experienced this situation before. Summer is a realistic approach of a girl who isn't looking for commitment, but then backfires on you. It makes you feel depressed and betrayed, but it happens. The thing that makes the film unique(r) is the fact is displays Tom's feelings so real. I was believing I was in his situation, and that makes a great film. I think the tag-line completes the film, as the movie really isn't the cliché, sappy movie it looks out to be. It's unique, real, and touching, and I recommend it for all. 10/10."

Tom had finally learned that there are no miracles. There is no such thing as fate. Nothing is meant to be. He was sure of it now. He was ... pretty sure."" <br/><br/>A great premise for a romantic comedy. In fact, it is the very essence of an audience's expectation of a love story and the film constructs it and deconstructs it beautifully, the above narration summing the film up neatly in the end, where we are left to ponder whether or not it was a happy ending. Does the boy finally get the girl?<br/><br/>For pure inventiveness of plot for such an archetypical genre, 500 Days of Summer gets an A, as do the performances of the leads. No easy task to capture the ups and downs of a roller coaster romance, the subtle mental and emotional dramas within a drama, turning and twisting on a whim or the simplest of acts, such as rejecting a hand that wishes to be held. I have a problem with the character arc of Summer which has a little to much pretzel configuration for the sake of making the theme / premise fit, but her dialogue and actions are real enough to suspend disbelief ... barely.

"ajs-10","8","1","2","26 September 2010"," One for the fallen romantics
","Deep down I'm a bit of a romantic that's been burned a time or several and so it was nice to find a film like this. It's not you're usual 'boy meets girl – they fall in love and live happily ever after' type of tale, no, it's much more realistic than that but with a large dose of quirkiness thrown in. I can't say it's my favourite romantic film, but it would probably make a top ten. But I digress, here's a bit about the plot first.<br/><br/>Tom Hansen is working for a greetings card company when Summer Finn starts to work there. He is, of course, attracted to her but is afraid to make the first move. His friends, McKenzie and Paul, persuade him to talk to her at a karaoke night and one thing leads to another. She tells him that she does not want a boyfriend and he agrees to just keep it light. But as time passes, it's clear that Tom is struggling not knowing where he is with her. He even asks advice from his street-wise little sister, Rachel. It seems the relationship is doomed when Summer leaves her job, and also Tom. He is heartbroken, but they are destined to meet again more than once.<br/><br/>The story is told in a rather unusual way; we start near the end of the 500 days and then jump back to the beginning. This continues throughout the film which meant the audience has to keep watching or they could get easily lost. I found it a different and refreshing way to put the narrative on the screen. Decent performances all round, so honourable mentions go to; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen, Zooey Deschanel as Summer Finn, Geoffrey Arend as McKenzie, Chloe Moretz as Rachel Hansen and Matthew Gray Gubler as Paul.<br/><br/>There are a lot of comparisons I can draw with other films; for instance, the character of Summer reminded me very much of Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961). There is a musical number performed in the street featuring Tom that could be from any musical you could name. At the end of the day I found it a very entertaining film, although Summer was a little irritating at times. But forgiving that, it's pretty much recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.9/10"
"MBunge","7","1","2","17 September 2010"," The moral of this story - Stop blaming your ex-girlfriend!
","This movie is a black comedy where all the darkness has been sucked out and replaced with a creamy filling of Zooey Deschanel. It's a brutally heartbreaking tale told with whimsy and wry appreciation.<br/><br/>One of those stories where the guy acts like the girl and the girl acts like the guy, (500) Days of Summer is about all the time Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) found himself in love with Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). He's a failed architect who now makes a living writing greeting cards. She's cute and smart and quirky and seems like the perfect girl Tom has been waiting his whole life to love. The problem is Summer hasn't been waiting her whole life to love anyone, especially Tom. She tells Tom up front that she doesn't believe in love and isn't interested in anything serious. As the movie jumps back and forth among the end, beginning and middle of their relationship, we see what happens when one person thinks they've found their soulmate and the other just thinks they've found a buddy. When Summer tires of indulging Tom's romantic pretensions, he's crushed flatter than a piece of chewing gum run over by the bulls of Pamplona and it's not at all clear if the story's going to end with Tom getting over Summer, getting her back or killing himself.<br/><br/>If you've ever been in one of those ""I love you more than you love me"" relationships, you know how painful they cab be. Watching that sort of thing in this movie, however, is a very pleasant experience. Part of that is the delightful Miss Deschanel. Most of it comes from these filmmakers recognizing that the bad guy in this story isn't Summer, it's Tom. (500) Days of Summer isn't about a good guy who gets his heart stomped on by some unfeeling bitch. This is about a guy who still clings to immature fantasies about love and his life and what it finally takes for him to grow up. You could think of this film as a less contrived and more relaxed version of Forgetting Sarah Marshall where the humor comes from understanding how many of Tom's problems are his own doing.<br/><br/>Miss Deschanel is lovely as the somewhat opaque Summer. We never get to see inside her character, but that's kind of the point. Tom never really sees her either, just how the idea of her fits in with his fantasy of love. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also excels in a tougher role than you'd expect. He never really gets to play the sympathetic victim because Tom isn't that sympathetic. While it shows Summer being a bit emotionally insensitive, the story never wavers from Tom's own responsibility for his situation.<br/><br/>With some comic relief from Tom's friends and his little sister, a great dance number and a nice soundtrack, (500) Days of Summer is a sweet little confection of a film. It does end on a moral that doesn't fit the rest of the story and it is very lightweight, but if you're looking for something to help you realize that maybe that old girlfriend isn't actually to blame for your life falling apart, I believe you'll quite enjoy it."

","Perhaps one of the greatest ""Rom Coms"" to come out in ages, this film spins the concept of what romantic comedies are to Hollywood. This film is sweet but tragic. It's endearing and real. The characters are treated like real people with real complex philosophical attractions to things like fate and destiny. It's always disappointing to watch a film of the same genre following its characters as they go through the motions to an ending that insults us and is preordained. In this case the film starts at the end and we see how these two people break up. And we are given insight through a series of flashbacks so we can piece together how the puzzle fell apart. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays it straight and charming. He's not unsure of himself and bumbling like other characters we have seen in similar roles. He's natural and easy to like. Zooey Deschanel also is wonderful in her performance and I have met girls like this before. Each bring their own foibles to the relationship. Both strength and weakness. There's a wonderful dance sequence with an old Hall and Oats song and the film has fun with it's narrations and observations. What a remarkable film and a great study of modern relationships."

","It's an simply she is not that into him comedy. Before watching the film, I cannot stop thinking that what makes this highly-praised indie film of 2009 so unique as its synopsis sounds really banal. Nevertheless after I finish the film, I do love it from the bottom of my heart and it turns out quite educational for most lovers as well. <br/><br/>In order to make this ultra-predictable story more delicious and attractive, director Marc Webb has offered us multiple levels of distractions, including the whole random narrative order, the reality/expectation split-screen shots and even animations, which shows that the team behind do esteem their audiences. I think it is also an important reason why Marc has been selected as the director of the upcoming Spider Man IV, as he knows very well how to please the audience and respect them at the same time.<br/><br/>Also the success of this film is largely owing to two protagonists' wonderful performances, especially for Joseph, I would give him an Oscar nomination if I was could, unfortunately the Academy members generally overlook this kind of light films. The chemistry between Joseph and Zooey are amazing and sincere, as if they just revert themselves to their authentic lives, sometimes the effect is heartrending, which was like a mirror, everyone could see himself/herself through the film.<br/><br/>One of my recurring argument is that it is very difficult to find a great script nowadays, which doesn't mean one could not be able to shoot a great film, ""(500) Days of Summer"" is a perfect example, even with a totally mundane story with a suspense-free script, if only one is conscientious and determined, he still can make a film unique and enjoyable, I think the esteem towards the massive audience is the main factor, which barely can be found in most of recent films."
"MovieProductions","7","1","2","17 August 2010"," The best romantic comedy I've ever seen- And it's not even a love story!
","*** out of (****)<br/><br/>Hollywood is typically known for throwing those nightmare inducing chick flicks that are heavily appalling to endure. How inconsistent, artificial, and non-relatable those pieces of drivel are. Take two A-list actors, a mammoth of a budget, heavy advertising, an A-list actor, and Hollywood automatically thinks those aspects make a decent film. Films these days have fallen so short of substance because of the unappealing character development, the paint-by-numbers plot, and the predictability level is off the charts. Shoot, even mentioning the aforementioned ways of Hollywood is already cliché and by-the-numbers in itself. Albeit, (500) Days of Summer is so shockingly realistic, that one may seem to think that in reality, one such romance would never end on such a hard punch to the abdomen. One would also predict that the film would come off as a pretentious, over-the-top mess that screams ""desperate"", just to appeal to the hipster crowd. Fortunately, (500) Days of Summer is so overbearingly real that it is a thousand times more relatable than any other romantic comedy you've ever seen. Also, how it manages to side skirt every ""chick flick"" cliché and comes off as anti-pretentious, is just remarkable. (500) Days of Summer is not just the best romantic comedy you'll ever see, but probably one of the best movies you'll see in the last five years.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer revolves around Tom (Levitt) who's outright admiration goes to Summer (Deschanel). Summer is like a pin point on a map that takes Tom's life to another adventure. Fortunately, Summer is Tom's ""luck-be-lady-tonight"" , although, things don't go as planned. Summer gives Tom a lecture on love and how artificial it is. How ""love"" is just a textbook topic that is a gimmick. However, Tom sees love in a different light and thinks it's a beautiful treasure. Albeit, Summer thinks Tom as a friend with benefits, while Tom thinks he has a bright future with Summer. Will the spotlight be panned on Tom or Summer?<br/><br/>The one of the many things that makes (500) Days of Summer play out like a commentary on life rather than a quick-buck cop-out, is the script. Just the dialog puts emphasis on how brutally honest this film is. The words the characters blurt out and the situations the characters encounter, is like a prime example of a documentary. Furthermore, the characters are just phenomenal. Their performances are so strong and realistic, it's like the viewer's life is projected onto the screen. To top it off, the film, stylistically, is a blast. The director uses a few tricks that are up his sleeves like the split screen. The film has a very ""indie"" feel to it. What's the icing on the cake, is the direction. This movie could have gone the inane and complete slap-in-the-face route, but it took the road less traveled by. Additionally, the soundtrack is just awe-inspiring. There's no cliché love songs or any mainstream sell-outs. Every music piece hits strong like a dodge ball does at a prepubescent kid in P.E. To add to that, the pacing is also flawless. No scenes feel tedious or too abrupt. Everything moves by at a rather smooth pace.<br/><br/>You know the times, whether prepubescent or adulthood, where a man has had a dream girl and thinks everything is going to be pinpointed on a map right in front of his face, although, things take a turn for the worst? (500) Days of Summer demonstrates the cold truth. The performances are raw, the script is rich with reality, and the direction is bold. This is what filmmakers should be doing. Instead, most romantic comedy directors are stuck in their sandbox love memories tinkering with their fantasy world, rather than reaching for the truth tinkering with reality. (500) Days of Summer is definitely a copy and paste of the average person's life, but I mean that in the greatest way. If there's only one romantic comedy you'll see this year, make sure it's this one."
"IndyMan_88","9","1","2","10 August 2010"," The feel-good film of 2009.
","This film was excellent. The cast puts on a pure heartfelt down-to-earth expression about the modernisms of relationships and how it is biased from the two people in one. We have the great and charismatic Joseph Gordon-Levitt who plays 'Tom' (3rd Rock from the Sun, Brick, INCEPTION) who wholly represents the hopefully romantic and perhaps foolish romantic who wants that one great person in his life. He has a lovable geeky mannerism with no time for circumlocution, no time for one-night- stands or other quick endeavours. He rages through all the typical energies of love, angst, hope, determination. His yin to his coherent yang is Zoe Deschanel's character 'Summer' who has an aura of melancholy and nostalgia of previous non-standing relationship surrounding her, whilst JGL's character tries affectionately to break her hard-shell prejudices of there being ""no such thing as love"". <br/><br/>There is a level of emotional climax found throughout, but it is up to the audience to find it. It has a the feeling of a warm afternoon summer breeze which starts to fade away into the autumnal currents. Then rise back to warmer weathers only to be pushed back into cold winter gusts.<br/><br/>All throughout you want Summer (Z. Deschanel) to *see* love in Tom (J. G-L), but the ending, like most Hollywood films end on, is bitter-sweet. It gives a lasting impression of hope, like a gasp of cheer. With a send off like a pat on the back, feeling fresh. As a film you try to expect where the plot will go and if she will see Tom for what he genuinely is, a guy very much in love with every bit of Summer. You walk out with a glassful of hope in one hand and joy in the other.<br/><br/>The most feel-good film of 2009 I reckon. Effortless to enjoy, like a wisp of sugar and smooth like Nutella. 8.5/10."

As well as a stand-out performance from Gordon-Levitt, the movie also offers a number of the year's most memorable and unique scenes. Expectation/Reality is a heartbreaking, perfectly edited split-screen sequence that dashes Gordon-Levitt's hopes of regaining Deschanel's love after they split. The film also perfectly captures that ""first love"" feeling of being on cloud nine with the hysterical dance sequence.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is as unique and vibrant as the character of Summer herself, and for a film fitting the description of ""romantic comedy"" in this current cinematic climate, that's some feat indeed.<br/><br/>9/10"

","After watching(or avoiding at times) all the sugary romantic movies that seem to try too hard to get its message across, 500 days of summer comes as a pleasant surprise. The movie doesn't aim for the sky and maybe it doesn't need to. It's a simple tale which is well told. Perhaps the most striking feature of this movie is its unconventional approach. The acting is consistent with the overall tone of the movie. No histrionics demanded, no histrionics delivered is the way i'd put it. The soundtrack is refreshing. The direction is adequate. What stands out however is the screenplay of the film. At a running time of just over 90 minutes, the editing is crisp. The fact that it does not take itself too seriously is its biggest advantage since that is precisely what makes it an easy watch. The movie might not feature in the list of 'top 100 movies' or 'movies you must watch before you die' but it's a nice way to spend a not-so-busy evening."

","I didn't know what to expect from this, but I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and it got some good reviews, so what the hell...<br/><br/>Well, I was pleasantly surprised. It's not the best thing, but it does try and that's a good thing. JGL is very good in this, he makes a good leading man, but I struggled with Zooey Deschanel's character, she seemed just a little too kookie and perhaps the romantic in me wanted them to work out. The film looks good as well, Los Angeles has never looked better, in fact I thought it was perhaps Seattle. There are also some various techniques employed to make the film a little different: There is the drawing of the park with has the number counter, although the clacking noise used really grated my nerves. I liked the 'fantasy' sequences, the one where Tom dances his way to work was great. Also the scene where the picture changes to a drawing. Another technique used was a split screen to portray the real and fantasy events of when Tom sees Summer at a party after they have broken up. Potentially distracting, it worked well, but I did begin to think at that point that maybe the film makers were trying a little to hard to be 'indie'.<br/><br/>The ending for me was a particular let down, it just seemed too contrived and convenient, the fact that the woman's name was Autumn made me cringe. But in all this is a good Sunday sofa DVD, which has a lot to enjoy, including some great music such as The Smiths.<br/><br/>More reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com"

Summer's character should be better fleshed out, they tried too hard to make the plot fit the title, I'm not a fan of the ending - and by ending I mean everything after their relationship starts going downhill. I enjoyed it, but I just can't think too hard about it. But you know what, we all know a Summer, and it's great to see a movie made about it.<br/><br/>Oh, the editing. I don't know. Normally I love unchronological editing and films that aren't afraid to be a bit different. And some parts were fantastic! There are parts where animation is worked in, and home videos, and these work well, but it just feels like the timeline isn't quite there. I get what they're trying to do, but I just don't think they put everything in chronological order and thought things through before scrambling it. <br/><br/>Ah well. It's probably just me being really picky. This movie was fantastic, I'm just tired of people being all OMG THIS IS SO AWESOME AND QUIRKY AND DIFFERENT AND REAL AND OMG!"

Why not let me experience the movie with both options open. You just killed the ""boy wins girl"" possibility.<br/><br/>The writer has effectively cut himself off at the knees.<br/><br/>Is it because he's telling the audience, ""Here, I just tied my hands by limiting my options -- now watch me write my way out of this one.""

","Tom is a greeting-card writer who dreams of becoming an architect and finding his true love. Summer is a vintage-looking beauty whose ideas about love are entirely modern. As Tom remembers his 500 days with Summer, his mind jumps from moment to moment, largely thinking of the good times in their trouble-filled relationship.<br/><br/>""This is a boy meets girl story, but it is not a love story."" As the opening lines of the film suggests, this is not your average romantic comedy and while that doesn't always mean it's a good thing, in this case, it is. Because of this, 500 DAYS OF SUMMER is one of the best movies of 2009. Not only is this a unique romantic comedy, but the way it tells its story is so ingenious and creative, that it makes this film one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. I loved it that much.<br/><br/>Sometimes, if a film has this really awesome and original idea, it ends up failing because of the way it's handled. However, it seems as if director Marc Webb used his music video side of him to his advantage to create something magical and enchanting. Every song used in this film is so perfect for the scenes they are used in that it puts Quentin Tarantino himself to shame. Webb also uses another technique used in many Tarantino films: The nonlinear narrative. And it works!<br/><br/>Another thing that works in this film is the two amazing leads: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. Gordon-Levitt is an actor I praised before in BRICK. He also starred in another fantastic film, THE LOOKOUT. Now, about two years later, he's better than ever, playing the charismatic leading man! Zooey Deschanel plays Gordon's love interest and she's as great as usual. I love her in anything she's in. Another person I would like to mention is Chloe Moretz. I personally found her to be my favorite character because she's flat out hilarious.<br/><br/>If you know me, you'd know I love movies about love. I especially love the tragic ones as well as the clichéd ones. Even though 500 DAYS OF SUMMER isn't either one of those, I was bound to love it. The film is both very funny and sweet. It's supports a great cast, a quirky and brilliant script, a unique style, and a director who has a bright future ahead of him. For those who love romantic comedies and those who have given up on them, 500 DAYS OF SUMMER is a film everyone should see once in their lifetime."

","First of all, let me just say I loved everything about this film! Let's begin with the cast, the cast was well picked. The awkwardness of the characters and the brilliantly flow of conversation was believable. I loved the way Zooey Deschanel presented herself, and only previously seen her in ""ELF"", she convinced me of her seriousness as an actress. I would of thought Joseph Gordon-Levitt would of stolen the film with his quirkiness and representation of a real-man however, Zooey stole the limelight. Secondly, I loved the style of the film, the flipping back and forward, sure, with my tiny mind it was hard to keep up with, however it showed how their relationship unfolded. Thirdly, the soundtrack to the film was sensational, the smiths... my they know how to steal my heart. The scene in the elevator was beautiful, and the scene in which Joseph's character is dancing was superb!<br/><br/>I think, the only thing that was annoying about this film was the ending, it was just silly!<br/><br/>-SPOILER- The scene in which he attends Summer's party, the directing style i thought clever as it was obvious that his expectations and what really happened would never match as they begin off sync with each other, that was my favourite scene!"

","If the story is not a love story, than it is also not about the story, but more, the source of story, which is always, character. I would love to tell you that this film wasn't about a break-up — but it is. I would love to tell you that this is a magical love story (which it kinda is) where ""boy meets girl (which happens), boy falls in love with girl (which definitely happens), and they both live happily ever after (which actually also happens, sorta)"" but like real life — it's a bit more complicated than that.<br/><br/>This is one of those films where you simply fall in love with the characters both because of the performances and the writing, and in the case of Levitt and Deschanel, their odd, sexy total package. I am waiting to see if Deschanel becomes an enduring star, but Levitt is the real thing as evidenced by an extraordinary range from comedy to very painful drama to violent intensity to raw sexuality to pathos...<br/><br/>Love, love, love it, Best Picture 2009"

","I admit that I'm not the biggest fan of romantic comedies. Yes, the odd rom-com can be fresh and interesting but I often find them to be reasonably unoriginal and a little clichéd. (500) Days of Summer couldn't be further from the average rom-com.<br/><br/>The film twists the stereotypical ""boy meets girl"" rom-com love story formula on its head, in this case, boy meets girl who doesn't believe in love. What ensues is a far more realistic and totally un-Hollywood account of two well-rounded and interesting characters, unsure of what they've got themselves into. Zooey Deschanel shines as Summer, playing the role with eccentric idiosyncrasy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt excels as a frustrated and confused young lover who believes in ideals such as love at first sight and true love. He portrays a multitude of emotions which are cunningly expressed through his job as a greeting cards writer.<br/><br/>The film encompasses numerous other flourishes besides the inspired casting and original plot; the score and soundtrack also suit the film's quirky tone and sharp screenplay perfectly and directorial embellishments such as dashes of traditional animation amongst a beautiful pastel colour palette only serve to garnish this thoughtful and unique film. It may be a little too ""indie"" for some but I thoroughly recommend (500) Days of Summer to anyone looking for something a little different from the typical romantic comedy.<br/><br/>8/10."
"sfiver","6","1","2","2 January 2010"," Different, quirky, real and honest
","I won't attempt to outdo some of the excellent reviewers on this site. But, for the record, it seems to me this is more of a ""coming-of-age"" story than a love story. Perhaps I just have yet to accept Mr. Gordon-Levitt as an adult. (He was 26 when this film was in production and still appears so damn youthful.) Whatever... he delivers a near-perfect performance as the wanna-be architect turned greeting card designer. (Makes sense in this current economy.) Falling in love with co-worker, Summer, the screenplay bounces back and forth over a 500-day period of their friendship/love story mainly from Tom's (Gordon-Levitt) point of view. Summer Finn's intense self-center absorption captivates Tom to near crazed, self-destructiveness. Ms. Zooey Dechannel's portrayal is good, but most scenes are carried by Gordon-Levitt. I imagine the part of Summer being played better by a score of actresses and perhaps the director intended this rather uneven pairing.<br/><br/>I think many of us will identify with these characters. The rather young, lost, soul-searching young male falling for the girl/woman ""wild-child"" beauty of a Summer Finn. Most likely during a college romance - not in one's mid-20's - but our world is an ever changing social order. The new 50 is now 40 and so on, and so on.<br/><br/>If for nothing else the film is worth your time and thought. Again, kudos to Joseph Gordon-Levitt."

","When I first saw the trailer for 500 Days of Summer, I could not wait to see it. It seemed like a unique, refreshingly real film; something new to offer to the romantic comedy genre, which has gone WAY downhill in the last 20-30 years. I feel like our expectations of what a really good movie should entail have also gone down, probably because there's so much rubbish out there, that even a film that is slightly creative (such as this), will get more merit than it truly deserves (that's my opinion). I have read several positive reviews of 500 Days of Summer, from different sites; most reviews agree that the directing, sequence of events, plot, etc., are original (especially the non-conventional love story) and that the cast is talented. Some more critical reviews mention that the film is not nearly as unique and original as it is made out to be, that the story is, in fact, predictable; something it sets out NOT to do. <br/><br/>500 Days of Summer takes you on a ride through the main character, Tom's, memory..err, fragments of memory, of his relationship with Summer. He falls in love with her, she does not want a serious relationship from the start, he is more serious about the relationship, she dumps him. He falls into a temporary post-breakup depression, he tries to see what went wrong. He learns that love and relationships are not guided by fate and happily-ever-after, and then he meets ""the one,"" who, surprise-surprise, is named after a different season. What I don't get, is how the relationship, so superficial, come to think of it, even lasted as long as it did. I guess 500 Days of Summer just sounds better than the more realistic, 90 Days of Summer. Anyway, this summary seems like it does not even scratch the surface, but believe me, it does more than just that; it's the film in a nutshell. Pepper it with some French film noir-type things (original, huh), some British pop/rock music, The Smiths, The Clash.., some hipster type clothing, a couple of karaoke scenes, a nice park atop a hill (which cannot be so beautiful in reality), and you've got 500 Days of Summer. It is not nearly as original as an independent or many foreign films; it simply lacks depth and creativity. Granted, there are some wonderful moments of...originality. Unfortunately, it seems to be overshadowed by the cliché. It was refreshing to actually be able to relate to the main character, Tom, but I feel like the film could have been delivered differently. I was entertained, but was not as enmeshed with the story/characters as I would have expected, and liked. Gordon-Levitt's performance is impeccable, however. He delivers- it is almost as though the entire film was based on his own personal experiences; he makes it so believable. He is one very talented actor (no prodigy or method actor like DeNiro or Nicholson, but he isn't really meant to be either). He is a very talented young actor, nonetheless, and I feel like this film will propel his career and allow him to develop his talent as an actor.<br/><br/>As for the film as a whole, however, I am critical for a reason. Watch it for yourself, if you haven't. At the very least, you will be entertained. I enjoyed this movie, but found myself bored with it too. I feel like the director tried to hard to prove how different this movie is- how fresh, unique, and upbeat it is, that he perhaps overdid it. I feel like directors should just do whatever feels right, without much regard to how it may be perceived. True art, in my opinion, only comes from thinking outside the box, and staying true to one's passion/creativity. Although 500 Days of Summer pushes the envelope a little, it isn't enough for it to be entirely different. Not a horrible film, but in my opinion, nothing special either."

","""Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."". Starting with the tag-line, it was clear that (500) Days of Summer wasn't going to be a typical romantic comedy. In fact, this film stands out as one of the rare genuine shots in the arm said genre so desperately needs, and that it succeeds is largely due to one thing: it's not really that romantic.<br/><br/>As the film's co-writer Michael Weber pointed out when the film was shown at the 2009 Locarno Film Festival (on the opening night, no less), the screenplay is ""loosely"" based on something that happened to his creative partner Scott Neustadter - something that is hilariously mentioned right before the opening credits (a brilliant spin on the familiar ""any resemblance with real events is coincidental"" caption). Not that the information is essential in order to enjoy the story of Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an aspiring architect who writes greeting cards for a living, and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), his boss's new secretary. Tom falls for her immediately, whereas she doesn't believe in true love. Despite that jarring contrast, the two actually end up together, although Summer's ""allergy"" to commitment is likely to cause problems...<br/><br/>So far, so predictable, right? How fortunate, then, that first-time director Marc Webb, aided by the writers, has decided to tell the story in non-linear fashion: the movie begins right after the break-up, and what happened before (and after) is reconstructed over the following 90 minutes. The aim is allegedly to play on the non-linearity of memory (the script jumps from day 1 to 300 or something), which allows the filmmakers to have a lot of fun movie-wise, thanks to clever editing - Tom entering an elevator happy and leaving heartbroken - and genre mixing, with the couple's conflicting views allowing for mental digressions that range from classic musicals to, of all people, Ingmar Bergman (the last time he got mentioned in a comedy was due to Woody Allen). Also, given Webb's music video pedigree, the soundtrack is very good and, unusually for a rom-com, devoid of sloppy sentiment (hello, Richard Curtis).<br/><br/>The other winning factor in the film is the combination of dialogue, which is smart yet real, and performances, specifically the two leads: no offense to the fine supporting cast (Clark Gregg, Chloe Moretz, Criminal Minds' Matthew Gray Gubler), but the movie wouldn't be half as charming if it weren't for Gordon-Levitt, funny and vulnerable in equal measure, and the lovely Deschanel, who gracefully charms, laughs and sings her way through the entire film. Ironically, considering the film's plot, they are a perfect couple.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is a little film that can, and will, entertain and move audiences everywhere. It's a romantic comedy that intelligently subverts or avoids most of the genre's clichés (including the romance) without ever coming off as a smug or cynical exercise in style. It also manages to overcome the ""I know how it's gonna end"" obstacle beautifully, with what is arguably one of the year's best closing lines. What's not to love?"

"Red_Identity","Null","1","2","29 November 2009"," A unique and experimental film. One of the year's finest!
","500 Days of Summer experiments with the pain and the happiness that romances bring. It deals with the expectations of a hard-in-love young man, and how his whole reasoning behind his feelings is about to be tested with who he believes is his soul-mate. Her name is Summer, and she is beautiful, charming, and honest. She does not believe in finding love for the first time, and does not see love in the point of view Toms sees it in. That is why when both Tom and Summer start being closer with each other, Tom is confused about what kind of relationship they are in. It turns out, Summer leads him down a path that will inevitably make him learn about how real life works. He believed that Summer was his one true love, and is even abstruck when it turns out Summer is the one that found someone she can call her 'soul-mate'. This reinforces his ideas that love is unexpected, and like the final scene says, there are just 'coincidences' that lead to it. <br/><br/>The film is directed by first-time film director Mark Webb, and he did a fantastic job. Thanks to the great screenplay, music, and editing he creates a sort of fairy-tale tone to it, but as the film goes along, we realize that that is not the case. There are many inventive scenes in the film, most notably a dance and music sequence, and a split-screen scene where Tom's expectations are met with the reality of the scene, and they are quite simply brilliant. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic as Tom, and Zooey Deschanel really nails her character. Deschanel embraces all of the reasons why Tom falls in love with her, making the audience as awestruck by her as he is. <br/><br/>Overall, this is quite simply the opposite of most romantic comedies these days, and for that I am very pleased. The film deserves high praise and honors!"

"shatteredrifle","10","1","2","7 November 2009"," 500 Days of Summer Tells The Truth
","Although the narrator makes a disclaimer at the start of the movie about it not being a love story, 500 Days of Summer can be easily said as one of the best romantic films of the year. Sure, the premise seems normal enough, but it manages to present itself in a different light, something that's fun to watch and at the same time actually something you can relate to.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is pretty convincing as Tom, the love-struck protagonist of the tale. The always adorable Zooey Deschanel plays Summer, his love interest who just wants their relationship to be ""casual."" Watching their times together is like a trip down memory lane, proving that a lot can happen in 500 days, some you would want to keep on remembering while others you would rather bury.<br/><br/>I do not know much about the director Marc Webb, but seeing 500 Days of Summer has made me a believer. He uses a lot of techniques to flesh out certain ideas (the dance number in the park was a delight to see) or emphasize situations (that Expectation and Reality bit was ingenious) that normally would have been just treated as just another scene. These contributions make the film very engaging, somehow doing better than the special effects commonly found in action pieces.<br/><br/>All and all, 500 Days of Summer is a movie which really hits the spot. Its brutal honesty about life, love and relationships combined with the right elements of romance and humor gets its audience captivated every single second of its running time.<br/><br/>Of course, not everyone can get the sort of happy ending of Tom right away, but it gives people hope that they're somehow headed towards that direction. It gives consolation to those who always blame themselves for things turning out badly. The truth is, as the film points out, sometimes, stuff just happen and you have to learn how to let go.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention it has a really wonderful soundtrack? Yes it does. So if you were not able to catch it in the cinemas, please make sure to get the DVD. With a movie like this one, the more you watch, the more you will understand what its message is."

","I'm impressed by this movie. At first I thought it would be just another romantic comedy, then I thought it would be a very good romantic comedy, and finally I found out it was something completely apart from all that. The narrator advised this wasn't a story of love, I grasped that as something they wouldn't play with, turns out he was right, this is actually a pretty depressing movie. Not by a mere generic kind of way, the boy loses girl and that's that. We actually feel he has lost something, and something he had absolute chances of getting, actually, it's revolting. The two main roles are played naturally, the girl has a mystery going on throughout the entire film, we never get the feeling we completely understood her; the boy is more of an open book, a shy guy who lost much of his aspirations even though he had lots of potential.<br/><br/>500 days of Summers actually refers to a girl named Summer and her relationship with the man-protagonist, from the first day, the day they met, until the last one. I would divide the film in three parts, two of them are the part with them getting along well and the one where they weren't, these two are interchanged during most of the film in no chronological order, for a good insight on their relationship overall. Until it reaches almost the end, the last part, and it starts following the correct order of events to finally come to an end. The support roles are pretty good as well, mainly with the guy's friends -- they share similar personalities with the protagonist. I also thought the comedy moments were great, lately I've been having some problems with comedies, they all seem rehashes and leave you with the feeling that you've heard or saw that one before, sometimes even many times before, that's something never actually occurred to me while watching this movie, even when you think that the main characters' overall personalities don't stray too much away from the romantic comedy cliché, but the way they are presented feels fresh.<br/><br/>Well, so much for the heart-warming romantic comedy, even so this ends up being a very touching movie. It's just that it's more of an encouraging ""get out of your seat and so something"" style than it is a ""don't worry, everything's gonna be all right"". Either way, an amazing movie nonetheless, full of freshness."

From the very beginning, the author warns us that this is not a love story, and he is more than right. This movie just cannot be put into a single genre. You can say that it is a comedy, because that is what I believed after the first ten minutes. But I was wrong, for the following events were rather dramatic than comedic. <br/><br/>I particularly liked Gordon Levitt's performance. I felt his pain, I understood his pain, he gave so much life and authenticity to the character. And since Zooey Deschanel just made me hate her through Summer's character, that certainly means she did a fabulous job as well. <br/><br/>The movie seemed completely real to me, and I just found it revealing, though painful. The ending was terribly disappointing, completely unrealistic and sort of contradicted the whole essence of the movie in my view. But, hey, they just had to remind me that it was just a movie after all, not life, right? I loved all the elements the director used in the structure of the movie, all the jumps backwards and forward the relation (call I call it relation?). I liked the whole thing that Summer is just a normal girl, height average, weight average, foot size slightly above average. All in all, it certainly deserves a 9, and for the director I have only words of praise. I think he should keep on directing movies, for he is doing a really unique thing."

","I must say, I'm not normally one who goes out looking for a ""flick"" one night, so my friends had to drag me out on this one. i sit down in that big comfy theater chair, expecting to see one of those non-realistic, lovey dovey movies, when all of a sudden, the narrator tells me I've got the wrong idea. He says its not a love story, but in fact something very different. boy was he right. this hilarious, yet very emotional film left me with a stupid grin on my face and a butterfly in my stomach. many unsolvable labyrinths of life are touched upon, like the notorious question of 'is there love?' and if so, 'how do you know you love someone?', or maybe, 'how do you know if someone loves you?'... With these questions come a zillion different situations that would provide a zillion different answers to each of the corresponding questions. this creative non- love story gives us a play by play on a very captivating combination of these situations."
"lopcar1993","10","1","2","17 October 2009"," Off-beat and quirky, smart and charming; all around a great film
","I love Romantic comedies, I love everything about them. The atmosphere, the style, the grace and humor(sometimes they got it sometimes they don't.) They are the very epitome of good fun and romance. But over the years this genre(like I said in my review of The Ugly Truth.) Has been stretched thin and mired down by bad and extremely bland Romantic Comedies that you could see what was going to happen before the film even began. But I'm truly and profoundly proud to say that (500) Days of Summer is nothing even close to the formula of romantic comedies, in fact it's one of the most complex and off beat entries in the genre to come out since in 20 years.<br/><br/>This movie I had no interest in seeing at first cause I thought it was just another formula Rom Com and I thought it wouldn't live up to my standards. Boy was I wrong! This movie lived up to my standards and then some. 500 days of summer is clever, smart, funny, honest, heart breaking, touching, sweet and oh so much fun, it's the very core of a great Rom Com and it has the heart of a great romantic drama to boot. It's a film that won't disappoint you and it may change how you see life and love . I know it confirmed my beliefs on both. All in all this film was fantastic in it's execution of the story of a boy meet's girl, boy falls in love with girl, but girl doesn't fall in love with boy; it's so unique in it's portrayal of how love and fate sometimes don't come easy and that sometimes you find love when you least expect it. Or even looking for it for that matter. It was great on some many levels it just made me feel so good and feel so bad at the same time( which is unique fro a Rom Com.) And there lies the keys to it's success and it's unflinchingly honest portrayal of how love really works.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt( Who I like, but has never made a movie that I liked besides Miracle at Saint Anna's.) really shows his stuff and proves he can really pull off a dramatic and comedic performance( In the same film! Which is very hard.) He brings a warm and very touching side to his character and he doesn't do it with grace or style but with the honesty of a regular Joe, which makes his character more likable. Zooey Deschanel( Who I didn't like until now.) makes her character Summer a heart breaker and a breath of fresh air, her character wasn't contrived or over done Summer was simple and plain and that makes her something of an off beat female love interest, but none the less is very effective. All in all the cast does nicely in this gorgeous and brilliant Romantic Dramedy.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is very rare as I've said and it's great and undeniable fun that is really and truly needs to be seen to believe . I don't think in all my years of watching movies have I ever been blown away by a Rom Com, but now I guess I can. This film has gone down as one of the best since Sleepless In Seattle but I'm happy to inform you that this movie surpass Sleepless in Seattle and makes that film look bad. It's a great utterly charming good time that is a film that will be remember and cherished for years to come. (500) Days of summer is 500 days you want to be apart of."
"writers_reign","7","1","2","17 October 2009"," Season To Taste
","There's a lot to like in this slightly offbeat bittersweet romantic comedy but ironically it's these very aspects that will probably prevent it from standing up to further viewings. More and more in the last few years we're getting stuff like this - Juno, The Station Agent, Garden State, Sideways, Junebug, lovely films that give you a lift when you see them once but seldom hold up to further viewings. If these indie filmmakers could isolate the ingredient(s) that make us happy to watch say, Double Indemnity, Midnight, Easy Living, Shane, etc over and over they'd never look back. It also helps that the leads - or indeed the majority of the supporting players - are not over familiar, this adds to the freshness as does the non-linear presentation. In retrospect not a lot happens, a guy thinks he's found his dream girl and soul mate combined, she likes him a lot but is not so sure he's her Mr. Right. They split, he's devastated, she marries someone else. Finally he meets someone else who just might be the one. Banal, maybe, but as I keep saying, it's the way you tell 'em."
"UncleTantra","10","1","2","15 October 2009"," 500 stars!
","OPENING NARRATION: This is a story of boy meets girl. The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met The One. This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total misreading of the movie 'The Graduate.' The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief. Since the disintegration of her parent's marriage she'd only loved two things. The first was her long dark hair. The second was how easily she could cut it off and not feel a thing. Tom meets Summer on January 8th. He knows almost immediately she is who he has been searching for. This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story.<br/><br/>But this review is. I am in love with this film.<br/><br/>I have been in love with it ever since seeing the trailer a few months ago. Watching a workprint of the film tonight not only did not dampen my ardor, it deepened it. And this is not an adolescent-crush-love-is-blind love on my part. I have my reasons for it.<br/><br/>First, there is Zooey Deschanel.<br/><br/>Second, how can you not love a film that starts with the following lines printed on screen before the credits?<br/><br/>AUTHOR'S NOTE: The following is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental.<br/><br/>Especially you Jenny Beckman.<br/><br/>Bitch.<br/><br/>Third, there is Zooey Deschanel.<br/><br/>In one pithy phrase, ""(500) Days Of Summer"" is easily the best romantic comedy in years. The writing is fabulous, containing more funny lines per minute than any film of this type I can think of since ""When Harry Met Sally.""<br/><br/>And there is Zooey Deschanel. A star is born.<br/><br/>Not that Joseph Gordon-Levitt isn't great. He follows up his excellent work in ""The Lookout"" and ""Killshot"" and other films with a film that will probably jumpstart his career as well. But hey! I'm a guy, and Zooey stole my heart just as effectively as she steals his.<br/><br/>Besides, it's a story told out of order, which I love. (500) Days Of Summer is exactly what the title implies it is, a tale composed of vignettes from the 500 days of an unforgettable love affair. But one of the things that makes this unforgettable love affair memorable is that these vignettes are presented not in sequence, as they happened, but in the order they need to be in to tell the story properly.<br/><br/>If the scale went up that far, I would give it 500 stars."
"dbborroughs","7","1","2","2 October 2009"," The course of romance
","The story of a relation ship over the course of 500 days. Zooey Deschanel plays Summer, the object of Tom Hansen's eye (he's played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt). We watch the relationship out of order as we are told what day we are seeing. Off beat romantic comedy turns the notion of a romantic comedy on its head as well as the notion of what is romance anyway. Very well acted, Daschenel and Gordon-Levitt sell the films quirky construction enough that we accept the way the film is told.. I think this is the sort of film that we probably can all relate to, more so if we've had a relationship crash and burn and we've had to crawl from the wreckage. It is as, the advertising says, not a romantic film but a film about romance in all it joy (there's a musical number) and sorrow. recommended."
"alexart-1","10","1","2","5 August 2009"," Summer of Love
","What is (500) Days of Summer exactly? Well, it's probably one of the best movies in your movie theater for starters. It's a well acted, beautifully shot look at love, heartbreak, and fate. While it's not your typical summer movie, it's still one that you should see.<br/><br/>The not so typical story of the movie follows a non-linear timeline. The title refers to the 500 days that Tom, played by the up-and-coming Joseph Gordon-Levitt, must endure and feel the effects of love and longing. The movie begins with a distraught Tom after Summer (Zooey Deschanel) has broken up with him. When he tries explaining his story to his little sister, she tells him to start from the beginning, and so he does. Throughout the course of the movie, the story unfolds in an interesting manner as we find out what caused the break-up.<br/><br/>Though you may be thinking that the movie is hipster trash, it's not. Yes, it's quirky and often includes elements that would attract many hipsters (constant pop culture references, art jokes, the fact that it's a Fox Searchlight film), it's a film for everyone. Some parts of it are so quirky that you're almost forced to laugh.<br/><br/>The acting is another great thing about this movie. We feel exactly what the director, Marc Webb, wants us to feel, but only due to the intense emotions portrayed by the characters. As Tom begins to experience depression, we feel it too. It's impossible not to fall in love with Summer's intense blue eyes and lovely personality. This intensity is also due, in part, to Marc Webb's visuals. The best example of this is a scene where Tom first has sex with Summer. The next day he wakes up and sings as he's walking to work. The scene is the only musical scene and yet, it's choreographed better than most musicals.<br/><br/>So there you have it. (500) Days of Summer is a charming look at the beginnings of a relationship, the end of a relationship, and recovery. It poses the stunning question of ""What is love?"" through it's well-written script and sweet performances. As the narrator says in the beginning of the film, ""This is not a love story."" and it truly is not. It's a look at what happens after a love story. (500) Days of Summer is the year's most quirky look at love and least predictable romance comedy ever. I think I'm in love."
"cshep","10","1","2","4 August 2009"," Terrific and Wonderful Film About Men and Women Relationships !!!
","This is truly a wonderful and deeply moving film that explores the budding relationship of Summer(Zooey Dechannel) and Tom(Joseph Gordon-Levitt).<br/><br/>Tom Hansen,LA greeting card designer and wanna be architect is cruising thru life and is waiting for that ""one"" girl , that will make his life complete ,enter Summer Finn. Lovely and talented Zooey Deschannel brushes into Tom's wide-eyed optimistic life and the roller coaster ride ensues. Shown in flash forward, flashback, and flash-sideways , each day is numbered,you would think that it would distract from the film, but it is held together beautifully by first time Director Marc Webb. He artfully crafts a fine film by showing the simple times that lead to complex relationships. Well done !!! <br/><br/>Pay special attention to the early childhood setup, this will help you to understand the ending. <br/><br/>Summer appears to be a care-free woman, but her character is complex, due to lack of functional parental relationship and lack of structure.<br/><br/>There is an impromptu musical dance number that defies description, what a moment ! <br/><br/>Chloe Moretz as Rachael Hansen is just a delight, along with the rest of this talented cast. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives an Oscar worthy performance, as the smitten would-be boyfriend, who wants a deep relationship and has to battle the realities of the world. Worth multiple viewings, and what could be considered a chick flick, really appeals to both sexes. The time honored tradition of trying to understand the opposite sex. I gave it a TEN, it is a perfect film, on may levels. Bittersweet, well maybe. I will give you a hit, Summer does love Tom, but , well, you have to see the film. One hour and 35 terrific minutes. A Slice of Heaven."
"lao4950000","10","1","2","28 July 2009"," A wonderfully honest movie that is remarkably warm yet sad at the same time
","This is a beautiful film that you simply MUST see if you've ever experienced heartbreak which I'm sure you have at one time or another. This movie is like an open diary to the hearts of anyone who is suffering from or has suffered from unrequited, burning, all consuming love.<br/><br/>The movie stars both Joseph Gordon Levitt, better known as the adorably hilarious teenager from 3rd Rock from the Sun as Tom, an actual honest to God sensitive handsome young man that most young ladies would snatch up in a heartbeat. He is literally everything you could ask for, handsome, intelligent, does relatively alright for himself and most and foremost he is a true believer in love. However, he meets and falls completely head over heels for Summer (Zooey Deschanel), a stunning brunette with gorgeous blue eyes with an irresistible quirkiness about her. However, this particular girl that Tom has completely fallen in love with is a love cynic, she unfortunately has been burned badly by past relationships(she never explains exactly how to Tom but we the audience can get a clear sense that she's been hurt very badly and this is how she comes to be so cynical about love) and is very reluctant to let Tom into her life. She later does bring down her walls and let him into her life, letting him stay over at her apartment, having hot shower sex with him, and inviting him into her private world that she normally hides from everyone else. Joseph truly deserves an Academy Award for literally placing us, the viewer right into his shoes......every height of ecstasy he feels when he interprets a kiss from Summer or a sweet and touching hand holding session as a declaration of love(sadly reading more into it than is actually there) to every agonizing low he feels when Summer leaves/breaks up with him. They go off and on again in an angst filled relationship for as the film is titled, 500 days.<br/><br/>Now this movie DOES NOT have your typical Hollywood ending where the boy meets the girl and despite going through trials and tribulations they end up happily ever after just like every other Disney movie. This movie is about A relationship, A great love of your life but not THE ONE TRUE love of your life that you end up being with. In real life, we will all meet and fall in love most likely with more than one person in our lifetime. Just because you do not end up married to your previous significant others for the rest of your life doesn't mean that the love you shared with those people wasn't real. The beauty of love isn't that it MIGHT last forever because sadly it doesn't always happen. The beauty of love is that it happens AT ALL. The beauty of Tom and Summer's relationship is measured in the childlike foolishness they engage in when they both shout out the word penis within range of public hearing(private joke between the two), the subtle but heartwarming way Summer knows that Tom is looking for validation from her so she takes her hand and holds his hand, how she went back to his apartment after he gets in a bar brawl with an a$$hole of a guy who was hitting on Summer( Tom and Summer are at a bar when this jerk starts hitting on Summer and even after seeing that she is with Tom he continues to harass her, so Tom being a stand up gentleman throws a good punch to his face, unfortunately this man is somewhat bigger than Tom and he proceeds to punch Tom back and beat him up quite badly) to show him that he DOES MEAN something to her. The love that Tom and Summer had was definitely real for BOTH of them, not just for Tom only as many other posters here have come away believing. Unfortunately, Tom and Summer weren't each others ULTIMATE love, and on an instinctive level Summer felt this but Tom did not, he wholeheartedly believed Summer was the one for him and you seriously couldn't blame the guy. At the end of the film, we find out that Summer does in fact get married.......but not to Tom. But this isn't actually a sad ending at all. The fact that Summer got married to ANYONE AT ALL is a miracle in itself, and she meets up with Tom again in the same spot in the park(she clearly did love him on some level as she remembered that Tom loved to sit in that particular spot in the park)specifically to find him and to give him a sense of resolution because she clearly does care for him. She tells Tom that their relationship taught her that she was wrong.....lasting love is real and she found it. No, it wasn't with Tom but it was thanks to Tom that she came to realize that kind of love can and does exist. Sensing that Tom is desperately yearning just for an answer, she gently reaches out with her hand to hold his.......to show him that he was right and that he wasn't wrong for loving her. At the very end of the film he meets another young woman named Autumn at an architect company who is applying for the same job he is. A quick conversation between the two reveals that she has many of the same interests that Tom has, and the film ends there hinting that perhaps Autumn is in fact Tom's ultimate love.<br/><br/>This is a true gem of a movie that any adult who has experienced both the joys and heartaches of a real relationship will completely empathize with. Indeed, you must go out and see it!"

","I walked into 500 Days of Summer not entirely sure what I was in for. Ten minutes into the film, I still wasn't quite sure what it was, but I knew I loved it.<br/><br/>This is just the movie I've been waiting for. As the tag-line says, it's not a love story, but a story about love. This couldn't be any truer, and I don't think there's any way I would have improved the movie.<br/><br/>Let's just get this out of the way now: I love quirky movies. I love creativity, I love new techniques, I love seeing something I haven't before. Let me also say that I am a romantic, and as a romantic, this movie gave me a fascinating new perspective.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschnael and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were both incredible, the latter particularly. He was sweet and charming, and it was easy to be swept up into his world. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was also great, and fit the tone of the movie beautifully. The story was awesome and still realistic. The writing was genius; smooth, funny, and cute to boot. There were several severely adorable scenes. (IKEA! for those who've seen it.) And the ending, well.. I'll let you see for yourself.<br/><br/>But most of my praise goes to the director, Mr. Marc Webb. This was his silver-screen debut, and I cannot wait to see where he goes next. The whole movie was absolutely stunning, beautiful but still real.<br/><br/>The way time moved backwards and forwards was very interesting and despite the jumps in time, it was all still easy to follow because the story became my story.<br/><br/>All in all, an amazing movie that comes highly recommended. I cannot wait to see this film again, and even more eagerly await the DVD release, so I can watch it to my heart's content. Because life is not a love story, it's a story about love."

","I've made a habit of writing my more recent reviews only on films that I truly enjoyed. Why not? What's the point of clouding the airwaves with my attempts at rationalizing why a movie sucked? It's not hard, however, to rationalize why ""(500) Days of Summer"" was a fantastic movie: it was bold, different, and completely entertaining. THE DIRECTOR: Brashly and uniquely told through the eyes of relatively green music video director Marc Webb, the plot continuously jumps through the 500 days of Tom and Summer's relationship. Webb uses a smörgåsbord of directorial techniques, from split-screens to musical numbers, all beautifully meshing together to tell one surprisingly cohesive story. All of your questions are eventually answered, a beautiful parallel between lives is drawn, and you leave the theater entirely satisfied. THE LEAD PLAYERS: Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt have fantastic chemistry, apparently developed off the set according to Fox Searchlight. Additionally, Gordon-Levitt's charming and off-beat buddies provide comic relief and context throughout the twists and turns of an extremely realistic relationship. THE BIG PICTURE: ""(500) Days of Summer"" is a movie whose intention is to have you watching from between your fingers one minute, and laughing aloud with your friends the next. You support the characters, you pity them, and if you've ever been in a relationship, you certainly identify with them. Enjoy this movie with a date as I did, it will not only renew your sense of true love and destiny, but also raise your spirits in a lackluster summer of movies."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>500 Days of Summer is a romantic-comedy movie that premiered in 2009. The movie is directed by Marc Webb. The movie is written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. The movie stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Zooey Deschanel. The movie uses a non-linear narrative that unfolds across its 95 minute running time. The movie is about a romantic engagement across the 500 days that the two are involved. The movie has the audience discover how the relationship collapsed.<br/><br/>500 Days of Summer is an energetically directed movie. This movie has a fun style across its running time. Marc Webb does a good job with the direction in this movie. It provides an interesting retrospective into what the character of Tom Hansen is thinking when he reminisces about Summer. There are many fun stylized and fantastical scenes in this movie that is played straight by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. This adds much to the movie's lightning pace and it makes the movie easy to follow from an emotional point of view.<br/><br/>500 Days of Summer is a rather basic movie. Aside from its unique presentation, the movie has a generic plot. 500 Days of Summer wants to utilize this to improve the overall movie experience. If the audience looks past this, they see a rather generic movie about a relationship and a breakup. The relationship is still interesting at times and Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel do a great job in their roles. It is the case that the movie does not do a great job with the overall plot.<br/><br/>I would recommend '500 Days of Summer.'<br/><br/>Grade: B"

The film, in my opinion, lacks direction and other characters are rather quite dull to say the least.<br/><br/>For a gal who doesn't see ideal love, to up and marry someone else so suddenly was ridiculous to say the least.<br/><br/>The ending is a real corker where our guy, on a job interview, meets a gal vying for the same position.

","I decided to watch this movie having heard good comments from others, accompanied by awards and nominations as well as good reviews from critics.

I honestly can't believe people rated this movie as 6, 7 or 8! The plot is super slow and boring, full of meaningless, unnecessarily repeated flashbacks without a solid story in the background. A guy likes the girl, she doesn't want any commitment,and bam! she marries someone else just like that. So? what's the point? what's the whole purpose behind this movie, apart from wasting 95 minutes of life? This is not even a cliché, it's an epic fail and I can't help but wonder why it's categorized as comedy in addition to drama and romance.

"blinky1986","8","1","3","3 January 2010"," A charming and unique romantic comedy.
","Ah, a rom-com, every guys worst nightmare? Not necessarily, I've much love for a good romance story but I confess most of my favourites are from some decades ago, but I'm an open minded guy who is willing to give the more recent romance films a go (as long as they've got a few good reviews first). From the start the scene is set, this isn't a typical Hollywood romance, there is no stuttering Hugh Grant slowly getting the girl of his dreams to fall for him, cue some catastrophe which makes it seem like they won't work but OH LOOK it's all OK in the end!! Nope. This is another one of those charming offbeat rom-coms that aren't afraid to be REAL. (Juno was undoubtedly last years gem). The opening monologue of the film declares this to be a 'Boy meets Girl' movie that isn't about love, however this simply isn't true. It's a story about love, loss and learning to move on.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who designs greeting cards for a living, he holds a degree in architecture but is yet to break free from the tethers of his meaningless job. Enter Summer ( Zooey Deschanel), new PA for Toms boss, and being so very beautiful and sweet it's only natural that Tom would fall in love with her at first sight. The films direction is what makes this tale so enthralling, the opening scene of the movie let's you know that it hasn't worked out; this match that is seemingly made in heaven just doesn't have the happy ending you will so desperately want to see. Instead the film swings like a pendulum throughout the time line of their relationship, one moment you will be in the early stages of their romance then you will be zipped forward in time to the depressing aftermath. <br/><br/>So there you have the setting, what about the performances? Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fast becoming a favourite of mine, I recently read a quote from him about how he isn't in acting for the money, but rather the quality of the script, and well he may just be making the right choices for me to actually believe this. After picking two excellent scripts in Brick and Mysterious Skin he has made the right choice again, he brings a genuinely charming nature and confidence which makes him completely endearing to watch, but when the time calls he can bring a darker element to his acting . Zooey is sweet beyond words, one portion of the film brings a tongue in cheek testament to her beauty (I think the line was she is responsible for an average of 18.4 double takes a day from men), her natural girl next door looks combined with her dismissive views on love makes her the unattainable girl you feel you must makes yours. The chemistry between the two is undeniable, even in the most fleeting of conversations they have you feel the spark between them.<br/><br/>The screenplay here is killer to, Marc Webb is handed a script that gives him much creative license. The breakaway scenes offer a bit of random comic relief, but my favourite is the morning after Toms sexual conquest when he walks down the street and bursts into a random song and dance number; the high fives, rocketing fountains and 'batting it out of the park' had me in complete stitches. Props have to be given to the soundtrack to, you have The Smiths, Doves, Regina Spektor and a few more I've probably missed, but they all fit the tone of the film so damn well.<br/><br/>Anyways, suffice to say I really enjoyed this. It's the type of film I think we need more of to break the monotony of the generic rom-com.<br/><br/>8/10"
"MartianOctocretr5","6","1","3","30 December 2009"," Cleverly composed writing; execution a bit shaky
","A self absorbed greeting card writer thinks he's found ""The One,"" a newly hired co-worker. She's a non-committal type, who ""doesn't believe in love,"" yet paradoxically flirts with him aggressively. More than flirts, sparking a weird and rocky relationship. Artistically, this lays a great foundation for an amusing, offbeat tale. Not quite a romance story (even though a relationship is at the center of the story), but more a character study with optimistic and pessimistic beliefs colliding. <br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel's portrayal of the flighty Summer is spot on. Her eye expressions and carefree delivery of lines convey the once-hurt-twice-apathetic attitude remarkably well. She commands the screen every time she is there, and her complex character's insulated insecurity seeps out in perfect measure for the audience to understand. She's blurry on what she wants from life, but she's brutally honest. She appears oblivious to her inadvertently hurtful behavior. <br/><br/>The guy playing Tom weakens the film. He ineptly attempts a dull ripoff of an early Dustin Hoffman role. He has the knotted, sweaty hair, all right, but not the acting talent. His bombastic approach makes the character inaccessible, unsympathetic, and irritating. No convincing chemistry with the female lead, or anybody else in the cast, for that matter. Tom's a Loser (with a capital L for emphasis), and goes obsessive emo-psycho. For the sake of both the movie and the audience, I wished somebody would smash those dishes over his head. No such luck: instead, we get the tiresome cliché of a precocious wise-cracking 12 year old giving advice. At least she's a good actress, something that cannot be said for Tom's two annoying side kick buddies. They reminded me of two talking Beevis and Butthead dolls that need their batteries replaced. Or their brains replaced. <br/><br/>Characters are always in theaters, one of many metaphors launched like a missile attack. Some of the metaphors work, but this overindulgence lacks purpose or comedic finesse. It seems the whole thing is attempting an amalgamation of stuff ""borrowed"" from the movie industry in general. ""Self analysis"" dialog (a la Woody Allen) is humorous but overused. The director has a music video background, and it shows with the intrusive soundtrack. Also, expect music video staples such as overly expressive acting, sultry close-ups, black-and-white imagery, and split screen vignettes. <br/><br/>The non-linear construction of the story telling is a narrative style obviously beyond this director's capacity. Instead of using dialog to establish the time line, he amateurishly resorts to ""day number"" captions. The setting of a greeting card company offered a treasure trove of one-liners, plus a great battlefield for the story's whole dynamic. Some of this potential is utilized, some squandered. The film settles for a predictable outcome, with no surprise whatsoever.<br/><br/>In summary: thoughtful idea, cleverly written, but with some flaws in execution. It's entertaining enough to warrant a viewing, and has a thought provoking message to consider."

","I really loved this movie. It's been a while since I've seen a movie that evoked such a wide range if feelings for me. I was expecting a ""chick flick"", but I don't think it fits that label. As a man I was pleased to see a side of relationships that's rarely really dealt with in movies. Tom was so easily relatable....and Summer accurately portrayed that capricious nature that I believe women often have that drives men crazy. She embodies what men are talking about when we say ""we don't understand women."" Relationships are not driven by thought or reason, but by feelings alone. I think this movie captured that perfectly...It was bittersweet, a satisfying experience in that I am now certain that my experiences in romance are shared, universal experiences that everyone probably goes through at least once in life.<br/><br/>To describe this movie in one sentence, I might say ""it is based on several billion true stories"" - the most relatable film I have seen in a long time! The characters are deep, Joseph Gordon-Levitt embodies sweetness and sensitivity without sacrificing any masculinity; Zooey Deschanel is captivatingly beautiful and enigmatic as Summer. I think this movie was cast perfectly. I give it a 10/10! I recommend buying or renting the DVD! :)"

That everyday feeling, together with the constant anachronistic jumping in time and the ""supernatural"" sequences (e.g. where Tom turns a walk to work into a musical daydream with drawn birds and a big band), the brilliant soundtrack (with Morrissey regalia to boot, imagine that) and a lot of desire turned this film into a great experience for me.

"Red_Flag","10","1","3","26 September 2009"," 500 Days isn't enough
","(500) Days of Summer is a simple story of boy meets girl. The boy Tom Hanson (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) believed his whole life that he wouldn't be happy until he found the one. The girl Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) did not share this believe. Were told right off the bat that this is not a love story. Its is however intensely personal, for anybody who has ever experienced unrequited love, which is likely to be a large proportion of the people who were sitting in the cinema. Its a romantic comedy for all extensive purposes, but unlike you've ever seen before. (500) Days of Summer reverses the roles usually associated with character tropes and places Tom as its starry eyed dreamer who believes that true love is just around the corner. Summer, played the dude in this situation. She is just out to have fun and as a consequence they both end up in a destructive relationship.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel star in director Mark Weber's wry, non-linear romantic comedy about a man who falls head over heels for a woman who doesn't believe in love. Mark (Gordon Levitt) is an aspiring architect who currently earns his living as a greeting card writer. Upon encountering his boss' beautiful new secretary Summer (Deschanel), Mark discovers that the pair have plenty in common despite the fact that she's seemingly out of his league; for starters, they both love The Smiths, and they're both fans of surrealist artist Magritte. Before long Mark is smitten. All he can think about is Summer. Mark believes deeply in the concept of soul mates, and he's finally found his. Unfortunately for Mark, Summer sees true love as the stuff of fairy tales, and isn't looking for romance. Undaunted and undeterred by his breezy lover's casual stance on relationships, Mark summons all of his might and courage to pursue Summer and convince her that their love is real.<br/><br/>The film does an excellent job of creating its own sense of style. Before every outing we would see the day we going to. Their break up occurs withing the hundreds and therefore every time it passes that mark were prepared for tears and tantrums. Marc Webb (director) has made an outstanding movie, one that will make my top ten list by the end of the year, mainly due the the raw reality of it. You see a argument occur and its so realistic it almost becomes uncomfortable. Fortunatly the films wins you back round with its quirky sense of humor which had me in sticks constantly. The film seems to have a lot going for it, a great sense of realism, hilarious moments and some impeccable direction and characterization. Its a stunner on many levels none more so than the acting. Both Deschanel and Levitt do an outstanding job at being the fun likable characters the are at the start of the time line and then there almost seamless descent into struggling human beings. They bring life what could have been lifeless characters.<br/><br/>Webb's direction is an absolute joy throughout, presenting the story in a series of inventive and original scenes that will stay with you long after you leave the cinema. Highlights include: a split-screen sequence that puts the reality of a party up against Tom's expectations; a French art-house film parody; and a simple but breathtakingly brilliant sequence where Webb uses the same four snapshot clips of Summer to illustrate both things Tom loves about her and later, things he hates about her. The tag line for the film sums it up perfectly: ""Boy meets Girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."" In addition, the narration insists early on that this is not a typical romcom; instead it's a beautifully written, modern day reworking of Annie Hall that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever had their heart broken. Needless to say, it also has a terrific soundtrack.<br/><br/>Verdict: 500 days inst long enough. The warm friendly glow of this romantic comedy mixed with the harsh reality of life makes for something we haven't seen in a very long time. A charming, funny and wonderfully inventive romcom that's easily one of the best films of the year. It is so absolutely adorable that, as the ending credits were rolling, I had the overwhelming urge to wrap my arms around the movie and never let it go. 5/5."
"StupidHumanSuit","10","1","3","24 September 2009"," ""I hate her crooked teeth. I hate the way she smacks her lips...""
","I have been a pretty huge fan of Marc Webb for his choice in direction for the music videos he has directed. He has directed some of my favorite bands and videos. From Green Day's ""Jesus of Suburbia"" to Brand New's ""Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades"" to Weezer's ""Perfect Situation"" to Jimmy Eat World's ""Work"" to My Chemical Romances' ""I'm Not Okay (I Promise)"". I've known for quite some time he is a incredibly talented director...but never in my wildest dreams had I imagined his true abilities. The more I think about it, the more this movie has become a favorite of mine. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel have some of the best on-screen chemistry I've ever seen. They blend together and make just about the greatest semi-couple of all time. This film is set over (500) days in a non-linear storyline and throws you onto a roller-coaster of emotions. For example: There is a scene in the film straight out of a dream where Tom and a large group behind him dances to Hall & Oates ""You Make My Dreams"", an animated bird fly's and lands on his shoulder. He walks into Summer's elevator, smiling and in a state of bliss. Not a second later, he is seen coming out of the same elevator, his hair disheveled and face joyless...hopeless. At the same time Tom falls for Summer, as does the audience. If you've ever seen her, Zooey Deschanel is just about the easiest person to fall in love with, and they use that perfectly against the audience. As the film progresses you realize that she is selfish and you begin to despise her. Something you or Tom, would never think of. You find her painfully lovely and terribly beautiful. You know she is perfect for Tom, but he is not perfect for her. He tries to hold back, tries to not feel the feelings he really has. In the end, you realize that love isn't about the type of music you listen to, the movies you love or the things you hate. It is a feeling you have absolutely no control over: a reckless, relentless and utterly unreasonable force.<br/><br/>The utilization of narration is the best I've seen since Magnolia, as the narrator tells the lives and secrets of these two personal, very lonely people. The shots of her eyes, her smile and her expression leaves you floored by her flawless design. The cut scenes are wonderfully placed and some of the ideas that ring true to life are realized in scenes that perfectly depict peoples real lives. From Webb's impeccable directing skills to Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel's beautiful acting, this film will leave you with a truly bittersweet message of love and hope. The Annie Hall for the new generation."
"Stampsfightclub","9","1","3","18 September 2009"," Exquisit romantic genre - a new approach
","Tom (Gordon-Levitt) believes in true love and is instantly attracted to a new office employee who, because of her parent's divorce has a damaged view on the emotion.<br/><br/>5 years ago Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind was released, bringing about a revitalizing and refreshing taste of romance genre, a cutting edge approach which saw Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet struggle to remember when they last met owing to a dangerous memory procedure. Blending an edge of fantasy with the dramatic implications with real life was a stroke of genius, and here we see a similar approach as director Marc Webb uses real life story of guy meets girl and adds a sharp blend of diverse filming.<br/><br/>One thing about romantic comedy dramas is that you know what you want from and the expectancy is set. 500 days is very much different from your average Hugh Grant flick though. For starters we see numerous fantasy montages, flashbacks, split screens and a wonderful music parody of the morning after and all will make you smile, laugh and even come the end, maybe shed a tear. The perfect use of justifying the genre is the split screen just past half way through where Tom goes to Summer's apartment with one side labelled expectations and the other reality. Without the aid of the forgettable narration we can see clearly into the young guy's mind, and there is no hint of hyperbole here, I struggle to recall anything that has been so well thought out in a romance film. It is staggering realistic and such a unique insight into a lonely guy's mind.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt adds the charm to this scene but his quiet dreams and cheeky expressions will have viewers on his side. Deschanel is wonderfully kooky once more and though you may spite her in numerous scenes, everything has reason in the end.<br/><br/>Speaking of which adds a wonderful comic touch and thank heavens doesn't go all soppy and conventional on us. Not since Lost in Translation has an ending in a romance been so well thought out.<br/><br/>The pair of actors balances each other well with Tom's friends adding the comic touches; though his younger sister may seem funny it is quite unlikely her advice is as profound as she seems to think. As mentioned Mark Webb's directional debut brings about new touches with his ability to take the picture out of context into his own fantasy world without seeming too otherworldly, which is a great credit as these touches really are the keystone to this film's success.<br/><br/>Where it fits amongst other big romantic comedies like When Harry met Sally, Eternal Sunshine and Titanic is difficult to say. It has such an adept approach to the genre and its diverse telling is exquisite and with such a likable cast and array of protagonists, it must certainly be up there."
"gentendo","9","1","3","12 September 2009"," Impressive Non-linear Editing
","Opening narration, ""This is a story of boy meets girl. But you should know up front, this is not a love story."" First impression: was the romantic comedy genre being toyed with?—as if what I were about to see was a pseudo, unorthodox love story masked with conventional love story elements? My assumption was right and wrong in two separate contexts. First, the film's non-linear editing style reminded me of the gimmicks of ""Memento""—that is, would the story have been nearly as compelling were it not for its editing? Conversely, play the film in linear motion: would it fall to pieces? Editing has the most powerful effect on the viewer's cinematic experience next to acting. The editing of ""500 Days,"" though thoroughly engaging, did not, however, make the film.<br/><br/>Renoir once said that editing is directing for the second time: it makes or breaks your experience. In the case of both films, I believe ""Memento"" would have bombed were it not for Dody Dorn, but ""500 Days"" would have still soared even with an exempted, non-linear style. The answer: the writing was too smart, even though Neustadter & Weber had to earn my respect. I anticipated something cheap and contrived (like the far too sophisticated, purely obnoxious and childish antics of ""Juno""). I had to be converted, and slowly though, I was.<br/><br/>The juxtaposition of scenes strengthened the quality of the film. I loved the truthfulness of the characters: first identifying what he loves about Summer (cut with parts of her body), later slabbed against what he hates about her (again, cut with the same footage). It holds true to the platitude: familiarity breeds contempt. The editing also worked with the split screen ""Reality vs. Expectation"" sequence. The differences between both screens were subtle yet terribly sincere, terribly true. I laughed out loud several times. I enjoyed the active participation and socially savvy relationship pedestals the writers invited me to celebrate & mourn.<br/><br/>There was also a healthy blend of realism and fantasy as depicted through the expressionistic personification & musically emotive ""after-sex"" scene. Walking out of his apartment, everything is fresh and vibrant: smiles all around from on watchers. Suddenly it breaks out into song and dance and we're watching ""Zippity Doo-Dah."" It was fun! There were moments where the dialogue was cliché but the acting and conceptual vocation held by Gordon-Levitt made it worthy of endurance. Come to think of it, Levitt's on-screen career made some of the cliché dialogue wonderfully ironic and that much more compelling.<br/><br/>The editing style, again, brought us back & forth through the polar spectrum of emotions: ""She loves me, She loves me not"" syndrome. Frankly, Summer was young and happy-go-lucky; not focusing upon dating labels or destinations, but purely enjoying the ride at Levitt's expense—very obnoxious but true. I guess that's a reflection of my willingness to fully commit in relationships rather than play the part with all the benefits without the labels. Overall, the film worked. I won't be surprised if it's up for Academy Awards."
"Otoboke","8","1","3","3 September 2009"," A bittersweet reminder that boy-meets-girl doesn't always end up as a love story.
","She loves The Smiths. Holy ****.<br/><br/>Those are the words that simultaneously grace Tom Hansen's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) synapses just as they explode into a cacophony of euphoria. Left alone to contemplate the implausibility of such a seemingly coincidental happenstance, Tom knows right there that he's in love; that's who he is—foolhardy and quick to romanticise. What he doesn't know however is that she, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) not only doesn't like being someone's girlfriend but that she doesn't believe in love either. Ouch. Like all determined poets however (although, here Tom is a talented aspiring architect rather than some whimsy caricature artist, which is probably for the best), Tom doesn't see how he could fail. Well, he does, but somehow there's just something about Summer that dispels the clouds and offers a ray of hope in return. Ah, poor, naïve Tom. You really can't help but feel for him.<br/><br/>You see, right from the opening scene of 500 Days of Summer, the narration quickly gets across that yes, this is story of boy-meets-girl, but that it is certainly not a love story, even if one of the characters tries to make it so. Rather, it's a story about love, and for all the glimmers of sweet romance and blossoming glints of that ever enigmatic force called love, the story is framed in a manner which constantly reinforces and abides by that opening statement. Told in a narrative that jumps back and forth between the beginning of Tom and Zooey's peculiar development as ""friends"" and some ten months later when Zooey skips town and leaves Tom hanging, 500 Days is no traditional romantic comedy. Indeed, in place of all the formulaic clichés and see-through characterisation lies a somewhat humble and down to earth portrait of a notably off-beat but nevertheless modern relationship. There's comedy, but it's never predictable or banal; there's drama, and yet it never comes off as contrived or overblown; and there's the romance that is sweet, but not sickly so.<br/><br/>So what you get, essentially, is a movie that surprises and yet feels conventional on the exact same page. Normally, framing a love story as something that inevitably fails is bad idea with no questions raised, however this isn't the case here. By opening the audience up to the fact that ten months down the line—or, 300 days of 500—Tom is going to be miserable once all the rushing feelings of happiness and comfort take their leave with the leaves that begin to fall from their branches at the closing of Summer's days; by opening the viewer up to this fact immediately, the audience is left to wonder ""well, what is going to happen that causes that seemingly infallible partnership to wither and die?"" Of course, Summer's admission is that it's just life; it's what happens, and it always does—and that is essentially the bitter truth behind much of 500 Days of Summer's first two acts.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses however, the central timeline which is told from Day One when Tom meets Summer where he works as a greeting card writer gradually gets closer and closer to the point where that ominous cloud of impending doom is right over Tom's head. From here, much of the story is told in a linear, ""what will happen now?"" fashion. Thankfully, the third act stays true to that which comes before in that it stays grounded and realistic without succumbing to predictable Hollywood staples that one expects when going into a romantic comedy. And that's not to say that the movie ends on a down-beaten note either—rather it's even more cathartic and satisfying than your average feature would indulge you with. Again, you're surprised, but at the same time more than comfortable with this change of perspective, and that's key to 500 Days' ability to feel refreshing and poignantly touching.<br/><br/>When it comes to casting, director Marc Webb and casting director Belasco hit the nail on the head with his two leads. Zooey Deschanel, who is fast becoming one of my favourite actresses of recent years plays a roll not at all dissimilar to much of her previous works in these genre films, but that's no coincidence at all. There's something about her eyes that just jumps off the screen with every little movement, and Webb capitalises on this at every moment possible, building up the architecture of Tom's inescapable destiny with all but the slightest glimpses in his direction from Summer. Tom Hansen has a much more complex role opposite Zooey in that he goes through many different passages throughout and has to offer the movie warmth that is notably low-key and downplayed in Deschanel's character. For the most part, he pulls it off well, yet it is in his scenes with his co-star that both really shine—so much so that when the movie's romance begins to unravel by the second act, the pity that Webb attempts to emote from the audience is palpable and as effective as it should be.<br/><br/>In the end however, the success of 500 Days of Summer largely comes down to the character of Tom and how he goes through one of the most defining points of his life. Refusing to dupe the viewer into a false sense of security, Neustadter and Weber's script indulges in the nuances associated with the often dubious and hopeless endeavours of looking for love with simplicity and heart-felt pathos as a pacemaker. Beating back and forth between The Smiths and Regina Skeptor, and flowing with a subtle restraint and subdued sense of reality imposed by director Marc Webb in his cinematic debut, 500 Days of Summer is a romantic comedy that exists to the viewer as a bittersweet reminder that boy-meets-girl doesn't always end up as a love story, at least, not the way you expect it to be.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"
"JankiSharma","10","1","3","2 September 2009"," after summer comes autumn
","500 days of summer directed by March Webb is interesting. Zooey Deschanel as Summer Finn believes in destiny and soul mates. Summer has no qualms of getting sexually and romantically involved with Tom Hansen (played by Joseph Gordon Levitt)who adores and worships the ground that Summer treads on. Summer is very honest right from the beginning about their relationship. She does not want what Tom wants. She believes in destiny and living a married life with someone she was destined to be a soul mate. It is difficult for Tom to imagine and believe that a soul mate is different from a romantically involved passionate individual. But then when Summer leaves Tom he realizes she believes in what she says. When he meets her after a few days , he is surprised that she is married, pregnant and totally content. His whole life and love revolved around Summer. Love comes in different ways. Love from a soul mate is totally different. It is special. Soul mate love draws positive energy, captures happiness and steadies the soul and the beating heart. This movie is different and very philosophical. Joseph Gordon Levitt as happy boyfriend and lucky to be with girl of his dreams did very well and evokes sympathy when Summer leaves him. Zooey Deschanel as Summer did a great job. Oscar worthy."

","How to reinvent the romantic comedy? Filmmakers either bold or foolish enough to attempt such a seemingly impossible challenge have struggled throughout the ages, floundering over the delicate balance between credibly depicting the trials and tribulations of romance while simultaneously satisfying the cathartic desire for a romanticized, happy Hollywood ending. The key, it would seem, as with prior success Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, lies in the filmmaker's daring to strive beyond obvious emotional satisfaction, even to the point of the protagonists' interactions not ending in a happy ever after. And in this regard, (500) Days of Summer proves a similarly rich and rewarding experience, all the more funny, entertaining and profoundly true through its toying with or outright disregard for the worn to death formula, demonstrating the definitive way to deliver a comedy or drama about romance. <br/><br/>Rather than using the eventual breakup as a surprise tragic twist, director Mark Webb instead eschews formula by simply presenting the relationship between Tom Hansen and Summer Finn, from start to finish, early, awkward flirtations to subsequent, devastating parting, capturing moments which are happy, sad and just plain strange. Which, of course, proves the ideal cocktail, as Webb's film sparkles with life and the sort of inventive genius in editing and cinematography which only a background in music videos could yield. Webb allows his film to mirror the emotional state of the protagonists both visually and tonally, bubbling with spontaneous dance numbers and animated Disney birds to convey Tom's early euphoria, later fuming with moody artistic scribbles, parallelling the trauma and existential grief of a break up, and eventually the quiet, reflective calm which comes with moving on. <br/><br/>It is a remarkable feat to travel such an emotional roller-coaster without feeling swept away in maudlin, excessive sentiment, but Webb's film, despite its inevitable forays into magic realism and storytelling coincidence, feels all the more crushing credible and honest because of its overtly cinematic touches rather than in spite of them. Even more helpful is the wry, irreverent sense of humour peppering the film throughout, with sly touches such as the sardonic narrator and fleeting, winking breaches of the fourth wall seeming to assure viewers throughout, preventing the emotional extremes from ever becoming excessively dour, or descending into mawkish indie cuteness. Completing the delightful package is Webb's sublime collection of soundtrack choices, serving to effortlessly fill in the emotional gaps when words or actions simply cannot capture the sheer essence of the situation. <br/><br/>Of course, despite the cinematic mastery on display, proper casting is essential for a successful relationship film, and in this respect, Webb achieves another triumph. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is flat out remarkable as unabashed romantic and optimist Tom, perfectly carrying the film with unshowy charisma, and an achingly credible emotional resonance, whether thrilled or crushed. However, Tom is not a romanticized hero, and Gordon-Levitt is just as game demonstrating his self-destructive wallowing, creating a more balanced and believable piece of characterization. Equally impressive is Zooey Deschanel as the titular Summer. Just as careful to humanize a potential spite-worthy caricature, Deschanel instead harnesses her trademark luminous quirkiness into something far more real, harder to outright love but impossible not to empathize with. Providing welcome support to the lead couple's flawless chemistry, Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Gray Gubler deliver welcome laughs as Tom's hapless best friends, and character actor Clark Gregg steals many a scene as an overly sentimental greeting card company editor. <br/><br/>Delightful, charming, traumatic and eventually hopeful, (500) Days of Summer proves the rare 'romantic comedy' (to use the term extremely loosely) or drama which is just as likely to appeal to unhappy singles as happy couples. Offering a slice of rare realism, all the more credible through its fantastic and cinematic trappings, Webb's film is a rare marvel which should not be missed, if only for the sake of redeeming a genre bogged down in painful cliché and falsities. <br/><br/>-9/10"

In the end, a very enjoyable film, with more to it than it seems.<br/><br/>We have seen several of this type of movie come out in the last few years, exploring the relationship between adolescents/young adults. Some have cleverly integrated humor, some exciting tunes, and a couple of clever twists to the same old story. Here, we are given plenty of charm, through its two amazing leads, combining good, realistic dialog, with tributes to the old films, where falling in love was enough to set off fireworks, spontaneous dancing, and well, at times, some slapstick.

Yet, there are also warnings about the whole, silly thing along the way.<br/><br/>There is pain and joy, love and hate, disappointment, bitterness, cynicism, and plenty of emotions going around in this film. There is enough to give even the smallest speaking part a great line. It is a terrific little movie that move us and makes us think, that can awaken in us some of the reactions that turned some films into classics. This is the type of movie that has been adapted to contemporary times to make it fresh, and yet it retains enough of the classic ingredients to show us how some stars are born, and what real chemistry feels like.<br/><br/>This is a film that caters to an audience with intelligence, with the ability to decide and choose, who can truly appreciate interesting cinema. There have been some very good films before, and for some reason John Cusack keeps popping in my head. Gordon-Levitt gives us a little more vulnerability and there less cynicism in his approach, and there is his counterpart, the dazzling Zooey Deschanel, with those amazing eyes that can speak volumes in one look.<br/><br/>Enjoyable, touching, and quite an interesting film."

","Let me start off by saying that I absolutely can't stand romantic comedies. I think they're unoriginal and boring. However, there have been some good romantic comedies especially the ones that focus more on the comedy and less on the romance. The exception with 500 Days of Summer is that it is told in the male's point of view and that was what was most intriguing to me. This was what distinguished the movie from any other brainless romantic comedies that might as well star Sandra Bullock, Kate Hudson or Matthew McConaughy. 500 Days of Summer was described as an anti romantic comedy. It's not a love story, but a story about love and I think that's why it's so appealing.<br/><br/>The main character is Tom, played by Joseph Gordon Levitt, meets Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel who Tom believes to be the one. We learn that Summer doesn't believe in love, but Tom does and that can be used to frustrate Tom or anyone watching the film because it is in his point of view.<br/><br/>The movie follows the 500 days that they spent together in no particular order. The movie literally starts a 488 and then jumps to day 1 then to 250 then to 4. It sounds like it's going to confusing but it actually wasn't. The story is going to jump all over the place and you have to be aware that this is going to happen quite frequently. This is what keeps the movie creative and original.<br/><br/>The performances in the movie were outstanding. Joseph Gordon Levitt definitely surprised me in this whole because I haven't seen him act in anything that wasn't comedic before. I recently saw him in GI Joe as the main villain and thought he gave a terrible performance. But in this I was able to care about his character and feel all of his emotions. Zooey Deschanel also surprised me. The last movie I saw her in was Yes Man, in which I thought that she gave a lazy performance and appeared like she wasn't paying attention for some reason. She plays the character effectively because you start off liking the character and then by the end, you will think she's evil. It's not that often that a I can change my opinion of a character so quickly, but she pulled it off. The only other performances that are worth mentioning are the Tom's coworkers who were there to support him and be humorous, even though their not big name actors. None of their jokes fell flat for me and I was constantly laughing at them. I didn't expect the movie to be so funny.<br/><br/>It was directed by Marc Webb and 500 Days of Summer is actually his first film. He actually used to do music videos and he even uses that skill in the film. Half way in to the movie there's a very well choreographed dance scene where everyone is dancing in the streets that felt like a music video. When this part comes in the movie it's very unexpected, but it is very funny to watch.<br/><br/>The main problem with romantic comedies is usually a bad script. That's not the case here because everything is so clever and intelligent, that it's so delightful to watch. It's written to be more realistic. When they first meet, it is very awkward and that would usually be what would happen in real life. The script writers previously wrote The Pink Panther 2, which shows that they must not be consistent because that was terrible and dumb. Hopefully, they'll be able to top this film because it was excellent and for a first time director, it's a big achievement.<br/><br/>There's one scene in particular that I really enjoyed. Tom was attending a party and was imagining his expectations for it. For an entire 3 minute scene, there is a split screen with the right side showing expectations and the left side showing the reality. It's very interesting to pay attention to both screens and this is the originality I'm talking about.<br/><br/>To conclude this review, I'm going to give 500 Day of Summer a 10/10. I think it was one of the best films I've seen all year and the best romantic comedy I've ever seen period. I really hope it gets nominated for a Best Picture. I think everyone should see it because it's too good to miss and I know people aren't going to give it a chance because it's an independent movie and it's not playing everywhere, but I recommend it even if you just want to be put in a good mood for 90 minutes."

","I like the way ,this story does not try a typical romantic comedy, but instead it shows the reality of love. Of how you feel when your in love and how you feel after it's over. And that is what I liked about it, that there was no Hollywood's to it. It felt like reality of life.<br/><br/>The centers around Tom(Joesph Gordon Levitt) who believes in true love, and there is Summer(Zoey Deschanel) who doesn't. But these get two get together, they begin quite a romance. But the question that comes to mind is that will it survive? <br/><br/>The two leads Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry and are believable in there roles. I also liked the way it was shot, quite beautiful I must say. 500 days of Summer is a winner."
"youngman44","7","1","3","14 August 2009"," When A Great Film Goes Bad (spoiler)
","Let's just cut to the chase: the writing in this film was top rate and smart - probably the smartest and most well acted romantic comedy in several years. The acting was excellent. But, the ending brings this down from a 9 to a 7. <br/><br/>The ending was just a downer and overly unrealistic. Sure, most romantic comedies have some lack of realism but Summer's character became very inconsistent; her personality just changed. From a fun-loving person to being bummed out about who she was with - to then enjoying their company again - right before they get engaged? <br/><br/>If you are dating someone (which I'm not, I'm happily married) and go to this movie - it will put a lot of pressure on a relationship if people get into this. I would not have been comfortable if I had been dating a girl and took her to this movie. <br/><br/>Ironically, the very thing the character in this film criticized (""falling in love"") is what happened. And, it is ultimately unrealistic. Marriage is not sustained by the feeling of love or that ""one moment where you know that is the person."" But, Hollywood continues to propagate this message. Love that makes a marriage last is commitment in spite of one's lost ""feelings"" - feelings fluctuate all the time (of course, in Hollywood, when feelings fluctuate - well, it's time to move on to the next girl or guy)."
"JimD73","9","1","3","13 August 2009"," Do not fear the chick flick, 500 Days of Summer is amazing and very thoughtful
","""This is a story of boy meets girl, but this is not a love story"" the narrator warns at the opening of 500 Days of Summer. ""I'm not looking for anything serious"" Zooey Deschanel's Summer warns Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Tom at the beginning of their relationship. Both the audience and Tom absorb this, but at the same time ignore it, and the revelation of its truth takes both the audience and the main character for one hell of a turn. Far from the chick flick it may seem to be, 500 Days of Summer is an incredible insight into male infatuation and perception that promises to be the indie hit of the year (think this years Juno).<br/><br/>The style of the movie is quite original, especially for those expecting a standard romance fare, so just go see the movie and don't read the reviews if at all possible.<br/><br/>500 Days begins around day 300, where Summer breaks up with Tom. This leaves 200 days for this to turn around though, right? We then revert right back to day 1, and continue to jump around in time over the 500 days span, from their first meeting in an elevator listening to the Smiths to their conflicting visits to IKEA and such.<br/><br/>It reminds me in a sense of the brilliant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which by the way I cannot recommend enough. The perception of Tom is what we see, and while it seems that many instances are romance clichés, when it is (through choreographed dance) made clear that the movie is through Tom's eyes and not a third party, we start to look below the surface of what is being shown. Failed relationships are not remembered as they actually happened, and the movie plays with this to a considerable extent.<br/><br/>The leads make this journey incredibly believable. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, through movies like Brick and The Lookout, has become one of my favourite actors out there right now (3rd Rock was a looooong time ago). He should be immediately identifiable for most guys, and decently lovable for most girls. His performance is nothing short of exceptional for the genre. Deschanel is also spot-on perfect as the girl who knows what she likes but has no idea what she wants.<br/><br/>I must give a brief praise for the soundtrack. The karaoke scenes make amazing use of The Pixies and The Clash (points for the most proper use of Train in Vain ever), and the inclusion of Wolfmother near the end is, for lack of a better word, awesome (yeah, thats right, Wolfmother in a ""romance"").<br/><br/>Do not fear the chick flick, 500 Days of Summer is amazing and very thoughtful. I fear somewhat that people expecting a chick flick will view it as a downer and guys won't see it because it wears the clothing of romance, 500 Days is the best movie of its kind I've seen since Eternal Sunshine, and by all means is a must-see."

","This is not a movie review, it is my punfested non-linear take on my 95 minute experience viewing & digesting the groundbreaking romantic comedy of the year ""500 Days of Summer"". 26th minute- Wow, I am flabbergasted that this witty romantic comedy does not construct itself with the standard cinematic norm of most other films by continuing to reveal the plot in a non-chronological system. 74th minute- Joseph Gordon-Levitt's starring performance as Tom, the ""hopeless romantic"" greeting card writer has to be considered for a Best Actor Oscar nomination for the authenticity he invokes in the character. 6th minute- God, Zooey Deschanel is so hot! Nominate her for a Best Actress Oscar for just prettiness magnetism alone. 62nd minute- Zooey is not just an ""acquired taste"" bombshell but she also delivers a restrained but accurate performance as Summer, the greeting card administrative assistant which Tom romances even though she does not reciprocate the same romantic stance towards him throughout most of the relationship. 34th minute- How cool! An entertaining Karaoke scene in the movie, you just don't get enough of good ones in movie scenes these days. 80th minute- Director Mark Webb's definitely has me caught up in his atypical web of developing a romance with a foreseeable breakup where boy is much more into it than girl, we as male species have all been there. Mark gets high marks from me for his auteur efforts here. 23rd minute- How cool! That is The Smith's ""There is a Light That Never Goes Out"" that Tom is listening to on his headphones in the elevator. I love that song and so far this movie! 1st minute- I hope ""500 Days of Summer"" lives up to all the hype people have been buzzing about this presumed creative movie. 58th minute- Man, I gotta go pee but I do not want to miss a second of this overwhelmingly creative movie. 58th and a half minute- OK, I am back, wow that was one of the fastest urinal releases I have had in my life; I hope I did not wet my pants with the quick shake (T.M.I. Alert!) 81st minute- Scott Neustadter & Michael Weber's super clever screenplay of this movie is my favorite so far this year in that department. Man, I know I could have revealed my feelings for that in a more witty fashion. I was just flabbergasted with the verbal wit of Scott and Michael's screenplay which has left me relatively punless. 66th minute- Feeling the thespian love of the commendable supporting performances of Geoffrey Arend as Tom's greeting card colleague & pal McKenzie and Clark Gregg as Tom's evenhanded supervisor Vance. 53rd minute- I hope I get at least a semi-nude glimpse of Zooey's left breast in this sex scene between Tom & Summer. 95th minute- ""500 Days of Summer"" will most certainly be in my Top 10 List at year's end! Loved it! 96th minute- Did I valet my parking pass? Dizzy? Sorry! Nevertheless, the right order you should take is to go to the movies and feel the innovative warmth of ""500 Days of Summer"". ***** Excellent"
"meininky","10","1","3","5 August 2009"," Happiness in watchable form
","(500) Days of Summer is the best movie I've seen all year. It's the best movie I've seen since WALL-E. It just might be my favorite movie of all time. Movies this original, smart, and funny are so few and far between, it's easy to forget they even exist. When they do come along, it's worth celebrating. Which my theater did; the enthusiasm was comparable to that at the Dark Knight midnight showing. There was so much laughter, so many exclamations, and plenty of sighs. As for me, as I headed to my car after the show, I imagined how all the passing drivers must think I'm a strange duck, I had such a goofy smile plastered to my face. I couldn't help it: if happiness itself could be taken and made into a movie, (500) Days of Summer would be the result.<br/><br/>I'll start with the screenplay. The nonlinear narrative structure allows for suspense (even when there seemingly shouldn't be) and plenty of laughs thanks to clever juxtapositioning of similar scenes happening at opposite ends of the relationship. The on screen counter, introductory paragraph, and final line all are fine examples of the offbeat but accessible wit which defines the film. The use of music is also fantastic; screenwriters sometimes are afraid to write specific songs into their screenplays for fear of seeming like they're trying to direct the movie, but every musical choice here is pitch-perfect (thus, my recent Amazon order for the soundtrack and newfound appreciation of Hall and Oates).<br/><br/>I also really appreciated the unique visuals, whether it involves animated elements, split-screen, or black and white. The latter is used when the film breaks styles, becoming an artsy European film or a documentary, and it adds even more to the film's charm. I love when a movie can use interesting visuals to complement a solid foundation (such as Eternal Sunshine or The Fountain), and that's definitely the case here.<br/><br/>Of course, a wonderful screenplay and cool visual tricks wouldn't do much for a romance if the leads weren't up to the task. Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are extremely likable and funny in their roles. Their chemistry is subtle and believable, and they really deliver an exciting arc. I definitely found myself rooting for the relationship, even with the promise of it not working out.<br/><br/>The thing that really cemented this film into a spot on my favorites list was the dance scene. I don't want to go into detail for fear of spoiling it, but the snippets in the trailer don't even begin to show the pure joy I received from watching that hilarity unfold. So brilliant.<br/><br/>Basically, don't miss this movie. I drove an hour and a half to see it, and am seriously considering making the drive again. If there was ever a movie worth going out of your way to see, this is it."

","Every year, there's at least one movie that makes you reflect upon choices you've made in your own life, one which touches you on a personal level. Last year, that film was The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This year, it's 500 Days of Summer. Deeply poignant, original, touching, and creative, Summer is a film which will stay in your mind for weeks to come. Directed by Marc Webb, one of the year's best movies also features stellar performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.<br/><br/>Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) believes in true love, in that one special person that everyone will find some day. Summer Flinn (Zooey Deschanel), however, does not. When Tom falls for Summer, a new intern at the greeting card company he works at, he knows it's love at first sight. Summer on the other hand remains skeptical.<br/><br/>While there's a whole lot more to the plot than that short paragraph, to spoil it all here would definitely be quite a shame. There's lots of twists and turns, and an ending that ties everything together quite beautifully. The whole thing is done with so much care for the characters, and all of the fantastic realism that shines through just makes it all the better.<br/><br/>The acting, for the most part, is what makes a film like this work so well, and this one is no exception. The two leads worked great off each other, showing raw emotion and talent all around. It's simply beyond me how Deschanel can go from a mediocre, predictable crapfest like Yes Man to a beautiful, original indie movie. Gordon-Levitt, as always, never ceases to impress, but he was definitely at his best in the this movie; it's quite possibly his best performance to date.<br/><br/>The originality and creativity present in this movie is, honestly, the best thing about it. It's just so damn easy to fall in love with it. The setup of time passing, the cinematography, the inventive narration, hell, even the after-sex dance party in the streets were simply phenomenal. The whole production is just oozing with talent and creativity, and it's astounding to see it all unfold. It's so simple and so effective that it's very easy to be taken aback by the beauty of it all.<br/><br/>I could probably rave about this movie for days. It was really that good. Just do the right thing: go out and see this indie film which has everyone talking. 500 Days of Summer is an early contender for best movie of the year. And if that doesn't get you to go check it out then I don't know what will."

To call a movie predictable is besides the point, if all you're looking for is to figure things out before the screen fades to black, then you my friend need to rethink your approach to movies. I may not have seen this movie just yet, but I've wanted to since before the commercials and hype, because I have faith in it as I see Joseph Gordon Levitt as a fine young actor. If you have any respect for indie films, watch Brick, and then tell me what you think of this ""guys"" acting. To the rest of you non-persnickety movie watchers, immerse, and enjoy then tell me what YOU think. You won't change my opinion, but it would be nice to know."
"JoshPatrickRiley","10","1","3","25 July 2009"," Eternal Sunshine meets Annie Hall
","This movie is the real deal. There are moments where the joy is so visceral that you have to smile, and moments of despair that cause an opposite visceral pain. Joseph Gordon Levitt's Tom Hanson is you head over heels with a girl who isn't, and if you're a guy you've been there at least once. Zooey Deschanel's Summer Finn is what makes Tom the greeting card writer believe in the love he's been writing about. Summer comes across as someone you want to know and fit into your adolescent fantasies of love, but you never get to know because you're too busy imagining your lives as one big movie. And this is one big movie.<br/><br/>Music is very important here, and the soundtrack is excellent. The relationship is started because of The Smiths ""There Is A Light That Never Goes Out"", and Summer is Tom's light that doesn't go out through those 500 days, even when his meals consist of Whiskey and junk food. Summer loves Ringo Starr the most out of the Beatles, and her favorite song is Octopus's Garden (Not your average John Lennon junkie), yet even when he tries to connect with her by showing her a Ringo solo record its too forced to work.<br/><br/>There are funny moments here too, even in the frequent brooding. On a date with a new girl there is ex-embellishing followed by drunken karaoke that is so horribly real you have to laugh. And you hope that when Tom's boss offers him to write sympathy cards when his love writing turns to expletives it could be real somewhere.<br/><br/>It makes sense that after 500 days of loving Summer something has to come next, and while the rest of the movie looks back at the past the ending is so open you wonder what will happen next in your own life."

","500 Days of Summer is a 2009 film directed by Marc Webb and stars Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. The film is distributed by 20th Century Fox under their ""Searchlight"" division, being labeled as a Dramatic ""Rom-Com"". I've seen the film yesterday and will give my observations and opinions to you. <br/><br/>500 Days tells the nonlinear tale of Tom's seemingly magical relationship with a girl named Summer. Entangling in Fate, Coincidence, and True Love, their relationship goes through leaps and bounds in terms of events and all goes south. Also, Richard McGonagle plays Morgan Freeman as a narrator. <br/><br/>The characters in 500 Days are all hipsters working in an office. I'll give the film credit for giving the two leads chemistry that is very fitting for the film's emotional range. I couldn't exactly get into the Tom (JGL) character since he didn't feel like a good enough audience surrogate, though the narrative structure isn't to blame, maybe it is the writing. And Zooey Deschanel does a good job playing Summer, being an a good and equal counterpart to JGL.<br/><br/>500 Days of Summer felt half-and-half for me. I was completely fine with the cinematography as some shots and scenes are well done. But nothing about the film went above & beyond for me which other indie romance films like Punch-Drunk Love and Eternal Sunshine did. Plus this breaks the filmmaking rule of never showing a better film in your own movie, which was The Graduate. As soon as our two characters were watching it, I said ""Yeah, I should be watching that instead.""<br/><br/>500 Days has it's feet planted in the themes of Love, Fate, Coincidence, and even Inevitability. Most of them play a part in the end and was disappointed the way it turned out, making the entire movie and concept into a pun. The movie felt to have a more somber mood than it should have since I would have liked it a little more if they had more fun with the script, acting, and tone in general. <br/><br/>After doing light research on the film, it certainly has found an audience. Kids will not be into this seeing as the concepts and story might not be understandable to them. People growing into adults will certainly have something to appreciate here. No matter what your opinion is on 500 Days is, I will respect it. <br/><br/>Overall, I give 500 Days of Summer a 5/10"
"gelman@attglobal.net","4","1","4","26 December 2009"," Disappointing
","Zooey Deschanel is one of the most sparkling young stars working in the film industry these days but her charms can't keep this feeble romantic comedy from falling on its face at intervals. Ms. Deschanel is Summer, and it's not just that Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom can't hold up his end. The two guys who play Tom's friends subtract from the movie every time they appear on screen, and the recurring ups and downs in the relationship between Summer and Tom did not hold this viewer's interest. Tom is in love with Summer, and she likes him but she's not ready to commit -- at least not to Tom. That's the essence of the story line, and it might work if Gordon-Levitt were as magnetic as Ms. Deschanel, if Tom's two friends were left on the cutting room floor, if the workplace in which Summer and Tom meet weren't a greeting card company (which produces a lot of lame jokes), and if the roller-coaster ride of the relationship weren't as repetitious as it is. In brief, despite Zooey Deschanel, there'e more wrong than right about this movie."

","Overall I didn't like this movie much, mostly because I felt the heartache of the guy for 90 minutes, which was not a nice experience. And I fail to see what was added by breaking up the chronology of the story, moving back and forth among the 500 days of their relationship. A simple question - why? Why do that? Why not follow it chronologically, the way it really happened, and the way, after all, we are supposed to fit it all together in our heads as the move unfolds? It just seems an unnecessary gimmick. If it were a mystery movie, or some terribly complicated plot that starts with us in the middle of things having to figure out a world we were suddenly dropped into, then a nonlinear presentation makes some sense. But it doesn't here."

","""All great architecture is the design of space that contains, cuddles, exalts, or stimulates the persons in that space."" - Philip Johnson <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom, a young architect who falls hopelessly in love with Summer, an attractive girl who works at his office. They enter a relationship but she is reluctant to commit to anything serious. She's been burnt by past relationships and no longer believes in commitment, whilst he is a romantic who believes in ""true love"", ""destiny"" and ""love at first sight"".<br/><br/>""500 Days of Summer"" has been praised for its ""originality"", but its really just a formulaic romantic comedy wrapped up in some simple role reversals. Usually the commitment-phobe is the male, but here it's Summer, who from the very outset warns Tom that she is merely looking for an empty sexual fling.<br/><br/>But though the film's humour never rises above sitcom level, ""500 Days of Summer"" does boast another interesting performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Levitt, who has churned out a series of great performances in such low budget independent movies as ""Brick"", ""Manic"", ""Mysterious Skin"" and ""The Lookout"", looks set to become a major A-list actor with his recent casting in Chris Nolan's ""Inception"". His introspective acting style, his quiet sexuality, his brooding characters, make him far more attractive than the usual one dimensional Hollywood poster boys.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing about the film, though, is the screenwriter's choice to portray Tom as an architect. Writers love to write themselves into their films, and often base their scripts around incidents and emotions that they personally experienced in real life. Scott Neustadter, the writer of ""500 Days of Summer"", himself admits that this screenplay was based on a real romance he had several years ago. But because writing is a solitary, visually boring occupation, with many negative connotations wrongly attached to it (writer as introvert, drunk, brooding, lonely, hostile, outcast etc), screenwriters often like to place themselves in their stories via the slightly more ""glamomerous"" art-form of ""architecture"". They see architecture as a sort of respectable cousin to writing. The use of architecture in this way has a long tradition in film, popping up in everything from crap like ""Indecept Proposal"" to ""There's Something About Mary"" to more prestigious fare like ""Don't Look Now"" and ""The Fountainhead"".<br/><br/>What's unique about ""500 Days of Summer"", though, is that the lead hero is both a writer (he writes greeting cards) and an architect who learns to turn his back on writing (which he associates with lies and ugliness) whilst embracing architecture (which he associates with beauty and truth). The irony is that once he embraces architecture, with all its structural beauty and clean lines, he finally learns to appreciate the truth, beauty and power of words.<br/><br/>Anyway, in the real world all artistry has long been eradicated from architecture. In Europe especially, architecture is now a dead art, architects living in a world where every building is subject to government regulations and strict design codes. In the UK, for example, you can't make even the simplest modification to your home (which are all, on average, over sixty years old) if the government deems it to be too outlandish, too ""upseting"". A simple garage or conservatory extension is often denied by the local government, who deems such things to be ""too obtrusive"" to the ""style"" and ""chacteristics"" of other homes in the area. Today architecture is only alive and vibrant in places like the Middle East, where heavy industry is on the rise and space is plentiful. <br/><br/>7.5/10 - This is an above average romantic comedy which, because of its excellent final scene, has managed to leave an overly positive final impression on audiences.<br/><br/>Worth one viewing."

I do have to give props to the writer to beable to write the screen play in the narrative he does which goes in the way of switching between timelines during the course of the film,its very interesting and must have been complicated.

"shaw-simon","7","1","4","9 September 2009"," Here Comes Your Man...
","Recently I commented on the woefully mediocre 'I Love You, Man' and argued its case as a romantic comedy for men. The infinitely superior (500) Days Of Summer could be pitched in a very similar way as it attempts to exchange typical gender character traits. The always excellent Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom, a sensitive singleton drifting in dead end job (he writes hokey greeting cards!) waiting for something to happen, waiting to fall in love with 'the one'. Enter Zooey Deschanel as the beautiful yet distant Summer who firmly upholds the belief that love is a myth and is considerably better off without the emotional baggage a relationship brings. One is smitten, the other interested yet coolly detached.<br/><br/>Whilst Zooey's performance is inarguably great (good enough to forget about 'The Happening' thank god), the film is centred on Tom and Gordon-Levitt is instantly likable and effortlessly carries the picture; a good job as there is barely a scene with out him. Whilst he is 'the sensitive type', he's not effete or sappy but instead familiar and convincing - your firmly on his side.<br/><br/>What transpires is a unique, realistic and entertainingly insightful movie with a great (if a little over-used) soundtrack. You could argue that this is a great or a bloody awful date movie, its quality however isn't up for discussion - one of this years best. Great karaoke scenes too!"
"Doctor_Mongoose","8","1","4","2 September 2009"," A fairly fresh, yet slightly over-stylised anti-romantic comedy.
","Before I watched 500 days of Summer I didn't really know too much about it. I had seen the trailer that had spruced it up to be a quirky yet throwaway romantic comedy, yet in reality the film seemed to have much greater aspirations.<br/><br/>The story revolves around this bloke and his obsession with his boss's new secetary, taking us through the story of their relationship in an interesting non-linear way. The non-linear storytelling is only a fraction of the dollops of style that is thrown in the direction of the film. Some of it works perfectly fine, adding an interesting extra dimension to the film, however it seems in places some of the style that was thrown ever so liberally completely misses and ends up getting stuck in your eye, leaving you fidgeting awkwardly wishing it wasn't there.<br/><br/>For the most part the story is interesting, managing to put a freshish spin on the whole ""boy meets girl"" thing that is seen so often in films. I did slap my head a few times when I thought the film had strayed into the realms of cheese that I thought it was going to stay away from, but these conventions are needed for the story to work. One scene in particular where the dude stands up in a meeting at work and makes a heartfelt speech about what he has learnt (and therefore the films message) went slightly too far in my opinion and cheapened an otherwise pretty original film.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel has really sexy eyes.<br/><br/>I think it is attempting to show the reality of love and life, which is that there isn't really a reality beyond what we impose based on our experiences and environment, which these days has been really quite distorted by the fakeness and shallowness of Hollywood love stories. The trouble with trying to do a critique like that is that when you have to write an ending to it you have to follow through with your convictions and let the story come to its natural conclusion, a conclusion, in this case by definition of the thesis, isn't going to sit well with the conventions of the genre. I think they chickened out, but only slightly. I do recommend that you see this film for yourself and see what you think."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","4","22 August 2009"," Masterpiece of the Good/Bad Times of Love
","(500) Days of Summer (2009) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>This romantic comedy is without question one of the best films of the year and will probably go down as one of the greatest films to grace the genre. It's not often I fall head over hill in love with a film from this genre but this here should be put beside ANNIE HALL in terms of its great characters and dialogue. The film tells the story of Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), two oddball people who begin dating, which is great until he starts to fall in love and she doesn't. Most Hollywood love stories are so corny and have so much sugar on them that one can't help but get choked in all the stupidity but thankfully that doesn't ring true with this independent masterpiece that manages to be thoughtful, intelligent, funny, sad and perfect nail down the ups and downs of a relationship. ANNIE HALL is my favorite movie of all time and there's a lot of comparisons that could be made with this film. Another favorite of mine from the past decade is Kevin Smith's CHASING AMY and once again, I think the films can be compared for their leading men who go after something they can't have. What works so well with this story is how incredibly charming it is right from the start. The masterful screenplay is so perfectly written that it can jump from happy to sad times and not miss a beat. A lot of director's wouldn't be able to handle this jump and that's why so many films end up feeling uneven but director Webb handles it all perfectly well and doesn't miss a beat. Another major plus is that the performances are so excellent that you can't help but fall in love with the characters. Gordon-Levitt plays that ""dork"" type of character but he brings so much more to the role. His comic timing is perfect but he also manages to be very believable in the more dramatic moments and this includes a rather heartbreaking scene at the end when he finally builds up the courage to ask Summer a certain question while sitting on a park bench. Deschanel seems to have a strong cult following around her and I was never a member until this film. She is so incredible in the role that I honestly can't sit here and think of anyone who would have been better or done more with it. She is so flawless in building up her role into a real character because you could have written her off as the bad person but that never happens because we, unlike Tom, can understand her feelings and her reasons for being the way she is. This is really a film about a guy who finds happiness and expects it to last forever when the second person might not be looking that far ahead. To me the film has a lot to say about relationships, feelings and just human nature all around. The romantic-comedy is perhaps the most worn out genre in film history but ever so often a real gem comes along and (500) DAYS OF SUMMER is that gem."
"ptb4life","9","1","4","20 August 2009"," A Great, not very typical, Romantic Comedy/Drama
","Saw this one last night.....be warned, this is a spoil heavy review.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a narrator telling us that this is not a love story....I wasn't sure if I believed him, or if this was some Hollywood misdirection. Well, he wasn't lying....kind of. As far as the outcome of this movie is concerned, it's more ""The Breakup"" than it is Two Weeks Notice. The 2 main characters don't end up together in the end.....but this IS still a love story. It just happens that it's a story about failed love.<br/><br/>Joe has met the girl of his dreams in Summer. She's pretty, funny, quirky....pretty much everything you'd want in a girlfriend. Yet, they break up in one of the opening scenes. The rest of the movie visits specific days in their love affair, in a non-linear fashion. One scene we see their first meeting, the next scene is 200 days later and they are fighting, the next is their first date. I found that it was a little tough to keep track of ""what came first"", but that's a very minor issue. The movie is consistently funny, and at times touching. Eventually the movie takes a turn into the more serious and I found a lot of it to be unexpected (but not unwelcome). I won't go into details, but it rang very true in my experience.<br/><br/>The movie is decidedly from Joe's point of view, so while the movie may look like a chick flick on the outside, I think that realistically, it's more a movie for guys.....specifically, for any guy who's ever had their heart broken. Many of us have had a Summer. I know I have. And pretty much everything Joe goes through is instantly relatable. Not knowing what the hell just happened because everything seemed just perfect. It's only when you can step back and really look at your relationship that you realize ""hmmmmm, maybe the cracks were there after all"".<br/><br/>I don't wanna say too much more about this one. I really enjoyed it, and I look forward to seeing it again when it comes home. Oh, and I really liked the ending. I thought it was the perfect way to end the movie.<br/><br/>Definitely Recommended.<br/><br/>P.S. Hopefully you saw The Graduate, it might help you out with a few scenes."
"EUyeshima","8","1","4","16 August 2009"," Fresh, Thoughtful Rom-Com Challenges One Man's Profound Faith in Love
","Many critics are already describing this 2009 indie romantic comedy as this generation's ""Annie Hall"", but the comparison is apt only to the point where both movies surprise and delight with their persistently unpredictable approaches to well-worn themes of love gone awry over the course of a relationship. I still don't think that this film, directed by feature-film neophyte Marc Webb and scripted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Webb, achieves the emotional resonance of the earlier Woody Allen classic, probably because there have been so many attempts in the intervening three decades to copy it, but this fresh-faced film is certainly not without its moments of charm and genuine revelation about the principal characters.<br/><br/>The time-jumping story follows the course of the rocky, five-hundred-day relationship between two LA-based twenty-somethings – Tom, an underachieving greeting-card writer who has not quite given up on his dreams to become an architect, and Summer, a recent Michigan transplant who is not looking for any long-term commitments. She is definitely the object of his growing affection, while she remains steadfastly a Holly Golightly-like fantasy figure. For a stretch, the movie feels somewhat facile and light-hearted in sketching the beginning of their courtship with the halted dialogue after a drunken karaoke night and a walk through IKEA as they pretend to be happy marrieds. The plot gets more interesting as their defining moments become jumbled from Tom's own sense of recollection, including Webb's use of film-school gimmicks like a split-screen treatment of a real-versus-imagined reunion and full-on tributes to Fellini and Bergman movies. The film's funniest bit is also the most unoriginal – a post-coital musical number set to Hall & Oates' ""You Make My Dreams"" that looks a lot like the Dr. Pepper ""Be a Pepper"" commercial from the 1970s.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Brick"") really comes into his own as Tom, providing a thoughtful depth to his portrayal of the likable but pained protagonist. As Summer, Zooey Deschanel has the more difficult role since we don't get a view of her inner feelings the way we see Tom's. However, she uses her big blue eyes and malleable, off-kilter manner to great effect here. More importantly, she makes Tom's emotional free-fall completely understandable. Other roles are filled out more predictably – Chloe Moretz as Tom's too-wise-for-her-years younger sister Rachel, and Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Gray Gubler as his two semi-slacker buddies. Still, this movie feels a lot fresher than most of the Hollywood product out there thanks to Webb's prodigious approach. He uses the ambiguous ending to Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate"" very well here, and there is a nice appreciation for Los Angeles architecture capped by a last scene in the legendary Bradbury Building."
"cheryllynecox-1","7","1","4","7 August 2009"," Summer and not enough Smoke
","Okay, alright already. Love story or not ""500 Days of Summer"" is an amiable portrait of a complex relationship between two adorable people. Dechanel as Summer and Levitt as Tom play well together. Their charming performances manage to overcome a screenplay that has a flaw or two.<br/><br/>The greeting card company as background could have used a bit more research -- I didn't believe for a moment that it could have thrived in a prime downtown LA address. The product it created was completely uninspired, even so much so as to seem pointless. Too bad, really, because Tom's Act IV epiphany confronts the idea of sacharrine sentiment and contrived expressions as substitutes for real human emotion.<br/><br/>I appreciated that Tom's tween sister was an old soul, but many of her scenes were too hip, too snarky. I wish someone would write a memo explaining that it's not necessarily comic when seniors and juniors use profanity. Copy it to every filmmaker on the planet.<br/><br/>Favorite scenes included the wacky IKEA store, the karaoke bar, with quirky moments throughout most of the film. The stylization using graphics and flashbacks was interesting. I relished the huge dance production number complete with marching band and old-style animation.<br/><br/>I understand that ""500 Days of Summer"" was trying to capture some of the whimsy associated with the romantic comedies of the 60's, but the narrator's voice-overs were annoying.<br/><br/>The film is good enough, but frankly, I was hoping for more."
"Quebec_Dragon","8","1","4","5 August 2009"," Refreshing unconventional indie romantic comedy
","What a nice surprise this was. A refreshing somewhat off-kilter romantic comedy about a hopeless romantic believing in one true love who falls for Summer, the girl who doesn't believe in the concept of love at all and even less in conventional labels. Yet she likes him and they do have a form of relationship. The narrative structure is peculiar going back and forth in non-chronological order during 500 days, of what? I won't tell you. It makes for some fun storytelling showing contrasts before and after certain events. There are some interesting visual finds (such as the split screen between expectations and reality, and the city fading) but overall it's rather conventional in terms of cinematography with ""actors staring straight at the camera"" shots being used a fair bit. The writing was at times quite clever and other times sounded realistic and sincere. I loved the narrator who added both seriousness and whimsy to the proceedings. I didn't care for the product placement of Ikea but I suppose it gives instant recognition as to what type of store it is. The audience I was with really responded to the movie: laughing, sighing and seeming to have a great time. I also enjoyed myself and smiled often. There are some really funny amusing scenes in this flick. <br/><br/>The two leads were quite charming, enthusiastic and had a wonderful chemistry. He's been acting since he was a kid but I predict great things for Joseph Gordon Levitt as a leading man. As for Zooey Deschanel as Summer, she has the cool girl next door appeal with something extra that makes her somewhat unattainable yet hard to resist or dislike. She's not bad, she's just honest and doesn't seem to believe in love. The enjoyable secondary characters didn't have big roles but most did have a shining moment with my favorite secondary character being the mature insightful-beyond-her-years younger sister of the main character. The ending seemed a bit forced to me although clever. It could have been better although it does kinda make things come full circle. Actually, watching this again much later on DVD, I think it's close to a perfect ending and it's certainly memorable. I was also forgetting to mention the very nice choice of songs from the likes of Regina Spektor, the Smiths and other cool acts. I see I'm being rather critical but overall I really enjoyed 500 Days of Summer and the more I talked to it with my friend, the more it made me want to see it again. I could see this film gaining a cult following or being a sleeper hit. It's definitely worth watching preferably with someone of the opposite sex, whether you're romantically involved or not.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10"
"EntertainmentBlogger","9","1","4","25 July 2009"," Not your usual rom-com
","Eight years after starring together in Manic, Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt re-team in this offbeat romantic comedy/drama about a woman who doesn't believe true love exists and the young man who falls for her. Let me cut right to the chase -- this is one of my favorite movies so far this summer. It's everything those usually weak romantic comedies are not (see The Ugly Truth review via link below). It's smart, it's unpredictable, it's enjoyable. I had a smile on my face from the opening narrative -- when a voice-over proclaims, ""this is a story of boy meets girl...but it's not a love story."" <br/><br/>The film moves in a non-linear fashion from the perspective of greeting card designer Tom(Gordon-Levitt) who falls for his new co-worker, Summer (Deschanel).Over the span of 500 days of their relationship, Tom goes from ecstatic giddiness one moment (even indulging in a classic fantasy song and dance sequence at one point) to crippling depression the next. The question is -- will everything work out and end neatly wrapped-up as most Hollywood endings do? I highly recommend you see for yourself.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt (Mysterious Skin) proves once again that he has mastered the uneasy transition from child star to adult roles. And Deschanel (so wooden in The Happening) is growing on me -- her quirkiness is definitely better suited for comedies than straight-up drama. But I was most amazed to learn that this is director Marc Webb's first motion picture. Webb, a music video and short film director, does a masterful job in this lyrical portrait of why and how we try so hard to make sense of love.<br/><br/>Grade: A-; I review movies @ http://movies-TV-entertainment.blogspot.com/"

Fox needs to spread this out more because it needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I saw (500) Days of Summer in a packed theater and that is how it is supposed to be. This movie is the most realistic take on love I've seen in a really long time. With an exception to a very over the top dance sequence with an animated bird.(but that was exceptionally brilliant scene.) Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel have this chemistry that makes the movie much more believable. Marc Webb is the first music video director to actually create something that is important and fun. (Also David Fincher!!! lol)<br/><br/>Whatever you do, find this movie. See It."
"koalamiasma","8","1","6","13 August 2019"," One of the finest romantic comedies ever
","I absolutely love this movie. From the very beginning the movie introduces its very personal sense of humour. I've seen the movie more than ten times by now and I laugh every time just as much as watching it the first time.<br/><br/>I usually dislike nonlinear storytelling in movies, since mostly the nonlinear story just ends up ""spoiling"" scenes that would've had more impact when told in linear order. In the beginning the movie tells you that it's not a love story, and 500 Days of Summer's humour justifies the nonlinear story. The movie handles the nonlinearity very well with a plenty of nice scenes where Marc Webb utilizes the possibilities of audiovisual storytelling greatly. With a great soundtrack the personal scenes feel even stronger.<br/><br/>The actors do a great job, no matter how small their part. There isn't a single bad performance in the movie, everyone fits the personal tone of the movie. The movie is also very quotable!<br/><br/>My only two major complaints is that the penultimate scene at the bench is the only scene which doesn't fit the movie too well. Summer's explanation about her sudden change of mind is left pretty shallow. Luckily the very last scene saves this, since it again supports the basic structure of the movie perfectly with the personal humour and the completion of the day-by-day narrative.<br/><br/>The other complaint is that if you don't enjoy the story the movie might feel too much like a series of scenes instead of a solid one movie. I personally enjoy the solution of showing the literal numbered days of Summer, but if someone doesn't enjoy the movie because of this, I undestand them fully.<br/><br/>8/10."
"JaysonT","7","1","13","23 July 2009"," Works until the very end
","""(500) Days of Summer"" is cleverly contrived, and at times very funny. The performances by the two leads are believable, concise and motivated. But despite a dependable build up of sharp characterization and witty exchanges, the conclusion is somewhat dishonest in the way it presents Zooey Deschanel's Summer.<br/><br/>She's an independent, subdued woman, very pretty yet her eyes are hollow and almost condescending. She dates Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) but makes it clear to him that she just wants a casual tryst. He understands, but of course starts falling for her. In no time at all he's making complicated reasons why she should be with him. She let's him know numerous occasions that she doesn't believe in true romance.<br/><br/>This is all fine- a profound homage to 1970s romanticism when Diane Keaton and Glenda Jackson could be outspoken role models for their audiences. However, the ending is then a 360 degree mess- when (Spoiler) Summer meets up with Tom months later, only to be a married woman to some guy she met in a coffee shop. What gives? Wasn't she someone not into the love scene? She tells him it just happened, but like him we are confused and tired out from her reasoning.<br/><br/>""(500) Days of Summer"" is a breath of fresh air to film enthusiasts like me who love to see a storyline finally build in realism with people and relationships vs. cheap beer parties and Megan Fox taking her top off. But the screenwriter obviously needs to still give us a little more insight into why Summer's character aloofly refuses Tom, but accepts some minuscule nobody we never even get to see."

","(500) days of summer does a great job of executing a realistic relationship that people of different ages can relate to in different ways which is why I think that it's so great.<br/><br/>As the story jumps around the timeline of their relationship it keeps it continuously engaging as you can clearly see the development without waiting the whole movie to see the development.<br/><br/>This movie also ages really well. If you watch it in different points in your life you will certainly have new perspective and interpretations of the characters/the story line in general. They keep the dialogue interesting and realistic along with the soundtrack/score. Also the incorporation of the unique style (showcasing the expectation/reality for example) makes this movie very aesthetically pleasing to look at.<br/><br/>I have conflicting feelings on the musical number as on one hand it was a nice change of pace/tone but it did feel a little out of place.

"nurikochan","4","0","2","27 November 2019"," Saved by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Chloë Grace Moretz
","I'll start off by saying I watched this while purposefully going through some of JGL's earlier works that I'd yet to see - between 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) and Inception (2010).<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of romcoms in general but I watched this with an open mind and no expectations. I couldn't believe how much I struggled to watch parts of it. It was slow, dull, and the non-linear timeline did nothing for me. I didn't enjoy having to sit through the repeated back-and-forth of watching one person's heartache and the other's selfish indifference when it could have been perfectly well told in chronological order.<br/><br/>As expected, Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fantastic job as Tom Hanson, and it's through his underappreciated acting skills you can sympathise with his character. Z. Deschanel's character Summer was irritating to watch, but you can see what she was trying to achieve. Some people might think the two of them had chemistry, but I would disagree - anything of that sort I'd again put it down to JGL's acting skills as you mostly see his expressions and body language when the two are in the same shot. Parts with Chloë Grace Moretz (who played Tom's younger sister Rachel) was a refreshing palate-cleanser between the ups and downs of Tom and Summer's pseudo-relationship, and watching the siblings was by far the most genuinely entertaining and delightful parts of the movie. Clark Gregg for his few lines was also good as Tom's sensitive and diplomatic boss Vance.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't a complete disaster, of course, but the overall plot was frustrating and left me pretty disinterested in watching anything more from ZD, and looking forward to (re)watching something better from JGL. Perhaps 10 Things I Hate About You, a romcom that is *actually* witty, meaningful, and full of believable chemistry between friends and loves...."

","What the hell is going on with me? I've never finished a rom-com in all my lifetime and last week I've watched La La Land and I think that opened an unexpected genre door for me.<br/><br/>500 days of Summer is awesome. The screenplay is extremely realistic and manages relatable ups and downs throughout the whole story. I guess the interpretation depends on your personality. For example, I had a very similar life experience such as Tom's (Gordon Levitt). He literally asked himself the same questions I did, even listened to the same music I do!<br/><br/>I loved how the romantic part of the film was connected with the things the truly enjoyed in life. It is no typical rom-com, it definitively finds originality within conversations and symbols that remain in your mind when the film is over.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt is an outstanding actor. He does a great couple with Zooey Deschanel, who gave her best performance so far, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Music is accurate and personally pleasing. Direction is as well, very clever techniques were used and there are plenty of remarkable moments. The ""Expectation vs Reality"" scene, the cinema within the cinema scene and the very last moment of the movie are some of the highlights.<br/><br/>Editing was precise as well, and cinematography was swift and soothing to the eye.<br/><br/>500 days of Summer is a great rom-com, and as you'll learn pretty soon (if you have'nt seen it, and are planning to) that it's a boy meet girl story, but not necessarily, a love story.<br/><br/>9/10."

","A decade since release, 500 Days of Summer still holds up as a charming but honest take on romance and not just in our modern generation.<br/><br/>What helps the film excel is its non-linear structure and creative film making within the genre including creative use of animation / CGI and moments of breaking the fourth wall. It remains romantic and funny while being relatable and grounded at its heart - while poking fun at the trappings of romance.<br/><br/>To no surprise, Joseph and Zoey were the ideal choices for the leads and Chloe Grace Moretz eats up any of the scenes she's featured in as Tom's younger sister.<br/><br/>As a 25 year old single male, I feel this movie is relatable to anyone if you give it a chance and it does stand out as a film about romance with a coming of age focus.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was nicely composed alongside a lot of licensed music which worked really nicely for the film.<br/><br/>A couple of jokes/comments might be considered non PC in 2019 but it's played ironically."

","After finishing '(500) Days of Summer' I thought to myself what an incredible film it was and decided on rating it a 9/10. Then as the night went on the film just wouldn't leave my mind. Little thoughts and moments kept creeping back into my mind for further analysis. After a few hours of this I realised I had no choice but to boost it to a 10/10. Any film that can stick with you this powerfully is a pretty unique and special thing.<br/><br/>The film has narration (some of the best narration of I've ever heard in a film) and one of the first things said is a warning to the audience that this isn't a love story. At that point I realised this film was going to be something special. It wasn't going to play to the Hollywood formulas that we have all become so accustomed to. In fact it's one of the more unique films I can ever remember seeing. And what makes it so unique is that it isn't afraid to be raw and powerful and let you personally feel the pain the characters feel.<br/><br/>There's so much to love about this film. The soundtrack is amazing, the humour is genuinely hilarious, the chemistry between the two leads, the brilliant story structure that lets you compare the good times to the bad and the unique scene ideas like Reality vs Expectation that can be analysed time and time again. If you are like me and never saw this when it first came out please take the time now to do so. It is so very worth it."
"Carrzinho","8","0","2","2 September 2019"," Refreshing take on the Rom-Com genre
","If you're going to do an indie rom-com, you're going to have to do something interesting with the formula. We are warned in the first couple of minutes by the narrator, ""This is a story of boy meets girl but be warned...this is not a love story"". It also uses the device of telling the story non-chronologically. So we're already shifting the conventional ground and all the better for it.
Zoe Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt have been friends in real life for nearly a decade and this makes for a very natural relationship on screen especially as the characters spend much of the movie ""as friends"". It's not especially funny though it does contain some sharp wit and spends more time in the Rom world, but there's plenty of story here too albeit as it's not chronological it's harder to dissect.
There are moments of whimsy by the director such as a short dance sequence, use of a split-screen and another where the scene dissolves into and architects sketch but because it's not taking itself too seriously it doesn't disrupt.
It plays with our perceptions of reality of the relationship we are witnessing so conveniently greys things up and again prevents a tear down, which most rom-com plots won't survive.
The supporting cast add colour especially Clarke Gregg as Gordon-Levitt's boss and Chloe Grace Moretz as his younger sister and wise beyond her (everyones) years Agony Aunt.
The soundtrack requires mentioning as it's very avant garde and again of an indie persuasion.
In a genre I garner scant enjoyment out of, I have to consider this a big success. It's successfully unconventional and engaging while still fulfilling the role of a Rom-Com. Well done. EIGHT"

","""(500) Days of Summer"", directed by Marc Webb is a lighthearted autopsy of a love gone sour from a strictly male point of view.<br/><br/>It follows the story of Tom, the nerd hero we all know and love, only this time, we're supposed to examine his impulses more critically, and see how his seemingly innocent motivations are actually toxic and unfair. ""He develops a mildly delusional obsession over a girl onto whom he projects all these fantasies. He thinks she'll give his life meaning because he doesn't care about much else going on in his life. A lot of boys and girls think their lives will have meaning if they find a partner who wants nothing else in life but them. That's not healthy. That's falling in love with the idea of a person, not the actual person."" (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Tom). Summer, on the other hand, portrayed by Zooey Deschanel, is a quiet deconstruction of the manic pixie dream girl .But unlike Garden State and Elizabethtown, 500 Days wisely grants its MPDG actual independence, and lets the sad-boy find himself only after their relationship is terminated. Although in the end we see Summer evolve as a character, from her saying that she doesnt want a relationship at all,to her getting married, which kinda breaks the rules of a MPDG.<br/><br/>The clever thing about this movie is that it legitimately avoids an easy reading, and can be appreciated in a million different ways by a milion different people. I also really don't think that the famous ""you like The Smiths?"" scene could be written today without being clouded by some heavy wink-winking. The sincere idea that you could fall for someone just because they like a sensitive/obscure band is no more. What makes 500 Days of Summer so good is that it both enforces that aesthetic while also criticizing it enough to keep the film from dating. The massively succesful plays into this idea as well.<br/><br/>Now about the cinematography, it seems pretty sweet and simple at first but then you notice the contrasts in this film, for example the shot sequence of Tom entering the elevator happy and then exiting the elevator deeply unhappy months later. Tom tells his friend Paul about some of Summer's characteristics that he is in love with. As he speaks of them, we see a montage of shots that shows these characteristics. The montage ends with him describing how he always hears a specific song when he thinks of her (and the song plays in the background). Later in the film, post break up, we see the exact same montage but instead of Tom describing how in love he is with these characteristics, he explains how he hates them. The montage ends with the same song playing and Tom loudly exclaiming how he hates this song. This is comedic but also serves as a reminder of how deeply hurt Tom is by the breakup. Also the use of split screen of expectations vs reality was one of the most interesting scenes in my opinion.<br/><br/>500 Days of Summer, an immensely pleasurable story about love telling the story of two young people with a deep connection but an uncertain future, feels both like a normal rom-com and an abnormal one; it's not obviously different but it is undeniably so. With its very catchy storyline, this movie is one of the best movies in the 'Romance' genre. With lots of highs and lows, the film is unpredictable and interesting right till the end."

","Opened on July 17, 2009 in the United States. Directed by Marc Webb. The movie boats the talents of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Tom) and Zooey Deschanel (Summer). Nominated for two Golden Globes.<br/><br/>The film is about a couple who dated for 500 days, but one of them was so dissatisfied with the break-up of the relationship that he decided to revive these days to find the answer to the question: "" why did this happen?"".<br/><br/>As Tom says this ""is not your typical love story"" because when the film start you imagine it will be a beautiful love story but it is really to put a damper. I love when Tom remember scenes and shows ""the expectation"" and ""the reality"", because when you are falling love you do not see the reality. The soundtrack represents the film faithfully.<br/><br/>Memory is a very important tool in dealing with relationship. What we remember will either help us or hurt us in the grand scheme of things. In Tom's case memory hindered him from achieving his personal goals in life. It wasn't until he realized his relationship with Summer wasn't meant to be that he was able to go out and get better. Summer looked back at her relationship with Tom and used that as a tool to find the man she would fall in love with and eventually marry. Memory is exactly what it is, so I recommend it, if you are looking for an unusual romantic film."

The cast, Summer is well done and she plays her role to a tee, Tom's sister is fun, and adds some humor and personality to Tom. Through all of this the absolute star of this film is the one and only Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

","Love! In one stances can be the most beautiful of human experiences that change a life, and bring a person whole oceans full of happiness. But at the same time, it can make people go their entire life searching for it, risking heart ache, pain and rejection and yet still never really finding it in the end. Then when you do find it, it makes you do crazy and stupid things, and when it comes to February the 14th, you're left with an empty wallet and remortgaged house just so you can put a smile on her face and a ring on it. So why go through all of it? Why, I'll tell you why, because its love, it's that unbelievable, confusing yet exiting sensation that no amount of words in the entire world could ever have a hope for defining. While Hollywood sucks at sequels and remakes, it seems these three godfathers of romantic films in the shape of When Harry met Sally, The Note Book and Titanic, has shown that Hollywood has had better success in the area of love and I feel that with release of Marc Webb's sensational depute 500 days of Summer is certainly a film that on merits, as time goes by will certainly join the before mention ranks. <br/><br/>Don't you find the same old boy meet girl story rather boring and contrived? And don't you absolutely hate the word romance films? First of all the title is not at all guy friendly, and certainly not a word you want to be throwing around in the guys changing rooms. But 500 Days of Summer is as far removed from a conventional and predictable romance film, as Saw is from a Disney family film. Why? Well when you think Romance films you think about fairy tales and happily ever after's, but in 500 Days of Summer it doesn't try to delude its audience, instead its franc, realistic and extremely relatable. Then secondly it's not just your standard boy meets girl, then they fall madly in love and finally get married in that same order time and time again, instead what writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (Fault in our Stars) did so ingeniously was rip up the boring old blue print, and put it back together in a fresh new and wacky way; think Romeo and Juliet meets Christopher Nolan's Memento. <br/><br/>Meet Tom (Gordon-Levitt), an aspiring architect stuck in a dead end job working for a card greeting company, that does nothing but inspire boredom from him. He's one of life's go- getters, internal optimist and a real glass half full type of guy. Oh and in a interesting roles reversal, he is absolutely obsessed with the notion of true love and soul mates, while on other hand we have the fresh faced, definition of cute secretary Summer (Zoe Deschanel) who doesn't buy the whole love thing, and would rather remain single than allowing it to consume her life. I can guess what you're thinking; you couldn't get any more diametrically opposed than if you brought chalk and cheese or day and night together. However sparks do fly between them and through a nonlinear sequence of events we jump, back and forth to various points of their relationships; from the highs to the lows, funny to the serious and the comedy to the drama as their differences make their relationship very difficult. <br/><br/>If you wanted me to list all the superlatives I have for 500 days of Summer for you, you would be spend days reading my review, after I had spent weeks writing it because the truth it, I loved the film from beginning to end. First the whole concept of the nonlinear telling of the story was both imaginative and interesting and certainly stands out above most of today's romance films with its inspired innovation. The script was phenomenal all the way through, provided a barrel of laughs whilst also injecting a sense of depth to the film that really made you pause and rethink things, and the fact the story was based on actually real world relationship experiences that the writers had, was probably why the film was able to resonate so deeply with its audiences upon release. If you were already a fan of the TV show New Girl staring Zoe Deschanel and you thought that she was really funny in the show, then watching her in this will send you to the hospital for literally bursting out laughing. But that is no disservice to my man Levitt, who offers a light hearted relief to his stone cold, lifeless performances in the Dark Knight Rises and Looper. <br/><br/>I was also particular impressed with Marc Webb's directing, especially seeing that this was his debut film, which I would rank up there with the likes of Mendes with American Beauty and Tarantino with Resiviour Dogs in terms of best depute film exploits. All in all, I would highly recommended film to all manly men, pessimists or horror fans, because it a lot more than just a romance film, it's a film about real life that I feel we can all learn a great deal from."

","And despite going ""Oh come on, of course it is"" throughout maybe more than half of the movie, it's really not a love story - which is what makes this rom-com so unique. Most films explore the whole ""boy meets girl makes her his wife"" (if I may quote Bruno Mars on this one) happy endings, but 500 Days of Summer takes this to another level. 500 Days of Summer deals with the brutal realities of love, and how two deeply flawed and in some ways polar opposite people can grow and change from their ""love"" (?) for each other. <br/><br/>Told in a unique non-linear narrative, with some interesting ""Reality"" vs. ""Expectation"" shots, this film is not only an interesting story, it is well directed and well executed.

","As a male who watched romance movies from time to time with no shame, I was caught off guard when I initially watched this movie. The genre this movie is categorized in are called ""chick flicks"", but (500) Days of Summer is a ""dude flick"". The movie displays how it feels to fall in love and be heartbroken from a male's perspective. From the start of the movie to the end, (500) Days of Summer, directed by Marc Webb, is a new fresh breath of romance film. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom Hansen, who is a greeting card writer working in New Jersey. He falls in love with his newly hired co-worker, Summer Finn (played by Zooey Deschanel), while Summer just falls ""in like"" back. Tom manages to convince her to be in a ""more-than-friends- but-not"" relationship, initiating the ""500 Day of Summer"". The 500 days sets off with all the upsides a young relationship can entail: feelings of happiness, butterflies, etc. as seen in Tom's musical act to the Hall & Oats song ""You Make My Dreams"" showing how one feels like they're on top of the world. However, soon enough their relationship turns into turmoil as Summer's interest in Tom wears off. Thus starts Tom's journey of great depression, heartbreak and effort to win Summer's feelings back. ""This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story."" While the movie proclaims itself as not a love story, it clearly is. Just not the one an audience would expect. Had (500) Days of Summer been another romance movie, the movie would have ended with Summer realizing she actually feels lonely and sad without Tom in her life, runs back into Tom's arms and admits her mutual love for him and they both live happily ever afterbut it's not just another romantic movie. Much like a Taylor Swift break-up song, it is a movie that the audience can relate to. (500) Days of Summer will undoubtedly make one nostalgic about the good, the bad, the ugly in past relationships, but in return will provide an arm around the shoulder to comfort them that they're not alone. <br/><br/>With his charismatic smile, cheeky optimism and genuine sorrow, Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes it easier for us to sympathize with his character. Zooey Deschanel plays her usual roles in movie as the charming free- spirit, but with a little stone cold twist. Her emotionless expressions towards the latter of their relationship leave much to be desired by Gordon-Levitt's character. Gordon-Levitt reacts on point in harmony with Zooey Deschanel. <br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer have become one my top two favorite movies and I would give it a ten out of ten. It's original, avoiding the stereotypes of cliché romance films, great chemistry between the two actors and an amazing storyline. If I had to say something bad about this movie, it would be the predictability of the ending of the movie, but it was a great ending nonetheless. This would make a great addition to the pound of ice cream, chocolate and tissues for a female friend who is going through a heartbreak or just a fun movie to watch whenever."

","I would have to say that the film is a love story as it features someone who does fall in love (spoiler alert) however it does not have a typical happy ending that you would expect/want which, i think, makes it an even better film. Overall, the film could be described as quirky due to: the nature of the characters, the job each character has and even the way the film has been created- with an occasional narrator and the way the film flicks back and forth in time. (Spoiler alert) By the end of the film I, personally, no longer liked Summer and almost hoped for a more cliché ending. However, the fact that the film is not what you expect makes it more unique and the empathy I had for the characters clearly meant that the characters were portrayed very well."

","500 Days of Summer is the type of rom-com I have been searching for. A Rom-Com which has both intriguing and instantly loving characters as well as an interesting un-chronological order for the structure. Not mentioning the witty dialogue between characters either they be protagonists or supporting characters. Always a good film to me is one which plays and cruelly messes with my emotions. It had me laughing, smiling, being embarrassed for some characters at awkward scenes, cry and make me go into a big curled up ball of depression and giving up in life. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a brilliant actor, no denying that. He makes the 'modern man' feel relatable to him presides his good looks and really did an excellent job in bringing out the character. Zooey Deschanel was also equally as good, she reminded me of the cute next door neighbour who has an awesome taste for the abnormal and bands. Chloe Grace Moretz has proved that all child actors are not bad and in some cases can be very likable, her relationship was believable and fun to watch with Joseph Gordon Levitt character and she stole most scenes she was in. This brings another key factor into this review, all the relationships are believable. Overall, Marc Webb shot this film beautifully and hats off to the writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber who helped bring an excellent example of Modern Day Cinema to our own screens. This film will be remembered as one of the best films of the 2000's era and I highly recommend it. Either you be in a relationship or not, this is definitely a 'must watch'.<br/><br/>That's a wrap!"

","It's a movie about love...a failed love. Kind of comedy. Good for those who believe in love, but they are bored about common stories. It describes how a boy met a girl, fell in love with her and she broke his heart. Summer, the girl, likes the boy,but she is afraid about compromises and reminds it of him all the time. He has a illusion about love: since he was young he said he was going to be happy after he finds the love of his life; and he believed that Summer was the love of his life. So wrong! The movie is told in flashback, that makes it more interesting. The soundtrack reinforces the scenes. And what good artists! I recommend it. Although it's a movie about love, it won't make you cry and it's not only for women."
"cinefreakdude","3","0","2","27 January 2013"," An overrated film with poor direction
","This is a movie that I have very mixed opinions on. I enjoy the movie overall, and do appreciate what it tries to do; but at the same time I think the film desendends into extreme simplifications of what it attempts to ""dissect"" and ""examine"" - love. Joseph Gordon-Levitt really does shine in (500) Days, and Zooey Deschanel is pretty good as well, although I never found her character to be very likable. As much as I'd like to overlook the film's flaws and just fall for the charm of the characters and hilarity of the script, I can't. In fact, some things in (500) Days of Summer I actually find pretentious and others just get on my nerves. Marc Webb directed music videos before going into film, and this was his directorial debut. Unfortunately, it might show just a little too much. The screenplay is packed with silly moments and situations. Some work as great gags. Others, not so much. Gordon-Levitt prancing around the park to a musical number is one that particularly sticks out to me. The scene is intended to show that Gordon-Levitt's character Tom is in love. At first nothing may appear wrong about the scene, the viewer will chuckle, smile (be reminded of Spider-man 3) and continue watching. Later in the movie, when Summer leaves Tom, the film goes into detailing Tom's ""depression period"". Tom wakes up every morning, goes to the convenience store (still in his pajamas) buys Twinkies and liquor and returns to his mess of a house. After watching the movie, I thought about the two scenes I just described: ""In Love"" (dancing and singing), and ""Depression - Not in Love"" (sleeping, drinking, being lazy). Webb tries to show ""love"" though the most obvious and watery way; shoving it our faces rather than subtly showing feelings subtly through the characters expressions, or eyes. In other words, the direction is lazy. I also found the ending of (500) Days of Summer a bit of a cop-out. The film mostly indulges in being ""artsy"" and it certainly has a indie style, which I recognize is what it's going for, but sometimes I found this to be a bit pretentious, and it kind of took me out of the film. The movie is definitely worth watching, It's no masterpiece, but you'll enjoy yourself for sure. There's many, many flaws, but (500) Days is funny, it's sweet and it sort of comes together. If you want some actually good films that examine relationships, I'd recommend the Annie Hall (1977), High Fidelity (2000), Before Sunrise & Before Sunset (1995,2004), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), and 2 Days in Paris (2007)."

","One of the best romantic comedies ever made is the wonderful ""(500) Days of Summer"". The movie tells the story of Tom, portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who falls in love with a girl that is not in the mood for a physical relationship named Summer, portrayed by Zooey Deschanel. The whole movie plays back and forth, which portrays a various nonlinear 500-day span in the relationship between Tom and Summer. Now, to cut straight to the point, this movie is one of the most excellent movies ever made. I loved every single moment in this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel provide excellent performances, and the two actors provide electrifying chemistry. Chloe Grace Moretz, Geoffrey Arend, Matthew Gray Gubler, and Minka Kelly round up the supporting cast, with unique and wonderful performances. The wonderful script provided by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber was such a well-written piece of romantic comedy literature, that I think nobody else has tried to write before. We finally have a decent rom-com that actually portrays a relationship accurately, and how most relationships are not your every-day fairytale. Finally Director Marc Webb brings an incredible visual style to the movie, and brought a taste of charm and sense into the screen. The film also provides excellent film editing, impressive animation, and it has a beautiful soundtrack to die for, with my favorite song in the movie, ""You Make my Dreams Come True"". This movie also has a dramatic feel to the movie when the relationship sometimes have their consequences, and it affects their lives forever. But, as I already mentioned, this movie succeeds at realistically portraying that not all relationships work out like how they do in fairy tales. Life is life, and we must accept the obstacles we face, especially in relationships, even when they don't have happy endings. ""(500) Days of Summer"" is an excellent favorite, and a must-see movie for everybody. ""(500) Days of Summer"", in my review, ""a wonderful, and excellent romantic comedy for everybody to enjoy""."

It's not the type of film you could watch in a passive manner due to the jumping around in terms of narrative but I like that this film again is trying to be different.<br/><br/>There are some very nice moments throughout the films 91 minute run and the ending in particular is very well handled by first time feature film director Mark Webb.<br/><br/>The film is a little slow in places and the supporting characters are not well fleshed out but it does not stop this film being worthy of the praise it gains."

","''This is not a love story. It's a story about love.'' sentences probably best explain what this movie is about. However, a deeper explanation is needed for the main characters Tom and Summer.<br/><br/>Remembering the scenes 'expectations and reality'', for our couple Tom and Summer it could be said that they don't match with each other. Besides, to my mind, this is not a ''miserable'' movie. In the end, everybody just follows their own path in life. Summer may be indecisive and have some unbalances in her relationship, whereas Tom has exaggerations about love and some biases on feelings that two people have for one another.<br/><br/>After watching it over and over again, I came to the conclusion that this film has its own philosophy. Love is weaved so delicately in it. Let me say, when you watch 500 Days of Summer carefully, take the gist of it out of the motion picture's brilliant magic.<br/><br/>Finally, I'd like to say that they don't need any relationships.

","Like 2007's Juno, it's the classic drama where boy loves girl and something doesn't work as planned.

She keeps saying they're just friends, even thought they apparently see each other everyday and he is very in love with her.<br/><br/>""(500) Days of Summer"" is good at showing how crazy a man can go if his love isn't matched. I myself have been in this situation for like 2 years, and at this exactly moment, I just came back from a ride with my ex-girlfriend. She has a boyfriend now, but she still keeps seducing me, creating an illusion in my heart and then she says she doesn't want anything with me. How am I supposed to deal with that? How is Tom? I don't know, he doesn't know, nobody knows! And this is a big taboo that may never have an ending, but we, human beings, have to keep on trying to find our love and our happiness.<br/><br/>After all these philosophical and romantic thoughts of mine, I finish this review saying that this film is worth a watch but it's not changing anybody's life."

Fantastic actor."
"hall895","7","0","1","7 May 2011"," The love story that's not a love story
","This is not a love story. The narrator tells us so right at the beginning. We meet our two central characters, our two lovebirds, and know immediately that their relationship is doomed to fail. As the film's title suggests the movie takes place over 500 days. But we begin near the end, day 488 to be precise. The love story that's not really a love story has already run its course. We see the end and then we are taken back to the beginning, day one. After that we're all over the place, constantly jumping forward and back in time, a jumbled mess of memories as a man remembers the good times and bad of the love affair that broke his heart.<br/><br/>The man with the broken heart is Tom, a man who trained as an architect only to wind up as a greeting card writer. He's a good-hearted guy, a man who is a fervent believer in the idea of true love. And when Summer shows up he's sure he has found the love of his life. Summer's a seemingly sweet girl. She's charming, quirky, offbeat. Kind of like the movie itself. And for that matter like the actress who plays the part, Zooey Deschanel. As you watch the movie play itself out it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Summer. Deschanel is utterly perfect. But as great as Deschanel is, as compelling as her character may be, this movie is about Tom. We're seeing the story from his perspective. We're rooting for him. For the movie to work the actor playing this part was always going to be the real key. Happily, Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a terrific job. Through all the highs and lows of the Tom and Summer relationship Gordon-Levitt captures wonderfully the emotions Tom is feeling in each moment. When Tom's heart breaks yours breaks right along with him.<br/><br/>From the moment he first laid eyes on her Tom saw Summer as the perfect woman. That was his first mistake. Nobody's perfect. Summer has her obvious charms but what's really hidden away behind the dazzling smile and big, blue eyes? Right at the start Summer tells Tom she does not believe in true love. Tom ignores this at his own peril. Tom and Summer seem to make a great couple but they want different things out of life, out of each other. Sure there are some good times along the way but it can't last. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry, playing off one another beautifully. Seeing them together makes you desperately wish this was a love story. But it's not. And the way the movie jumps around in time puts a smart, well-played twist on the story. We can see the best time in the relationship, the highest of highs. And then immediately jump forward to the lowest of lows. A great illustration of how fragile something seemingly so perfect can really be. Where did it all go wrong? Tom's trying to sort it out inside his head and we're right there with him. This is a movie about a doomed relationship, about a man who had his heart shredded to pieces. But, no doubt helped by the two great lead performances, it's charming nonetheless. It's not a spectacular movie but it's certainly enjoyable and clever too. It's a movie which puts some unique twists on the typical love story. The biggest twist being that it's not really a love story at all."

","Watching a movie like this is just such a big sigh of relief. It's just one glorious breath of fresh air. A beautiful escape from the mundane, the monotone, and the redundant. (500) Days of Summer is a story of boy meets girl, but it is not a love story. It is a story about love. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom, a writer for a greeting card company who one day meets the girl of his dreams, Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel. The film chronicles the relationship between Tom and Summer for 500 days which include love, lust, ups, and downs, and plenty of surprises. To label this film as just a romantic comedy would be an injustice to what this film really is, which is a sincere, smart, and human film about life and love.<br/><br/>Films this lively, sharp, smart, and uniquely brilliant just don't come around often enough, making (500) Days of Summer a rare gem. I think it all begins with this films script. The script has all the wit and style that an innocent and lighthearted film like this needs. It is hilarious, as well as heartwarming and deeply moving. Everything about this film is unique and offbeat and the script holds this quirky yet sincere style together wonderfully.<br/><br/>What is so great about this film is that is really narrows its focus and stays on a straight path that follows the two main characters and their relationship. There are plenty of other characters with their own stories, but they are stories only mentioned in passing. The real heart and soul of the movie comes from where it should, the offbeat romance between Tom and Summer. The film avoids spinning off in a whole bunch of tangents that don't further the purpose of the film at all. It stays focused on what the audience wants to see, and what we fall in love with. And it helps that it does focus on two incredibly interesting characters. Tom writes for a greeting card company but wants to be an architect. He has all sorts of style to his persona, but doesn't flaunt it. Summer is a very average girl in looks, but she is so different and Tom sees her as such a rare and perfect girl. We really fall in love with Tom and feel so much sympathy for him during all of the tragic bouts of his relationship with Summer. The film opens with Summer breaking up with him, then the rest jumps around in their relationship. It is all told ingeniously and with the perfect amount of organization to the development of the story that it is able to elicit the maximum amount of sympathy and passion out of the audience.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is funny, smart, lovable, sincere, heartwarming, sad, real, and human. It is one of those movies with such a rare beauty to it that it is something you have to see for yourself if you want to understand it. The magnificence of it all can't be described in words, making watching the movie such a treat. This is a movie that I feel like I could watch over and over again, probably picking up on more and more of its witty little quirks that the movie thrives on. There is nothing to hate about this movie and it is something you can get so much enjoyment from whether this is your type of genre or not. It is just so well made and so addictive. I love this film."
"suicidalicecreamtruckdriver","7","0","1","16 March 2011"," A good comedy that ignores the obvious
","(500) Days Of Summer is a movie that poses as a story that is about love but it can't be classified as a love story. Most romantic comedies (that generally get, and deserve a critical savaging) go through a boring and dull formula of a pop music soundtrack and boy- meets- girl, girl finds dilemma and is insecure, they kiss and the end. This movie is different, and it's safe to describe it as bittersweet in some aspects. It's sweet in the romance department mainly due to the fantastic chemistry between Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon- Levitt). It's not afraid to be bitter, either. The non-linear narrative makes the film more complex as well. The performances are believable and it is great film to watch with the humor and the intriguing characters that it posses. Although the film can fill a bit hipsterish at times with all The Smiths references and the soundtrack mixed with indie and folk acts, which is likely to alienate the audience at times and might damage the care factor that the audience have for the characters, it is a good film. It's worth a watch, but it isn't for everyone, and I'm not implying for a second that people who do not like this film are below the ones that like it. Rating: 7/10"

The non-linear way the story of this couple unfolds is brilliant, it is quirky and sweet and smart without trying SO hard (i.e. Juno) or being obnoxious about it. This is one of the most heartbreakingly realistic portrayals of a relationship in any film. Two people can care about each other, but want different things and just fall apart. I came to despise the character of Summer by the end, she was hypocritical for telling tom time and tome again she wants to be on her own and doesn't want to get bogged down in a serious relationship, and then ends up getting MARRIED. Not cool. But everything ties together in the end, with Tom meeting his true soul mate only because Summer pushed him to follow his dream. I was sobbing like a baby by the end.

Now if there is one negative aspect of this movie is that the guy protagonist played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt doesn't really talk about the girl's personality who he fell for and felt a slightly pretentious. But I really liked his character in this, maybe it's because I can relate to the protagonist in this movie. What I really enjoyed was that this isn't a straightforward and narrow romantic comedy and the nonlinear narrative structure works really well in this. It's a movie that is film that is easy to relate with and I liked the chemistry between Summer(Zooey Deschanel) and Tom(Joseph Gordon-Levitt). I also really enjoyed the soundtrack to this movie, they really couldn't have picked better songs. The relationship just seemed so real especially how Tom starts falling for the girl. Even parts about him wanting a girl that he thinks he will never have a chance with and the building of his frustration because of this was all believable. Some reviewers claim this movie is refreshing for a romantic comedy and I have to agree and will help notice the little things in relationships as well.

"michellemanning7098","10","0","2","2 February 2011"," I'm sorry, you said this was an indie film?
","The depth of thought and range of emotion in this movie provides the ultimate spectrum of life. The lack of chronological order reflects the scatter brained mind Tom Hansen is coping with. You remember Tom and Summer's relationship in the same manner that he does. The adjacent good times versus bad times form a comical parallel that make you laugh in a dark way. <br/><br/>Marc Webb's style in (500) Days of Summer is ultimately enticing and has such a unique approach that I was consistently bewildered throughout the course of watching this film. The split frame of ""reality"" versus ""expectations"" enthralls even men who hate romantic movies and touches on a very personal level with anyone who ever had an expectation that was soon crushed by reality. I envy Marc Webb for his creativity and his brilliant execution of this movie.<br/><br/>Anyone who claims Summer Finn to be a heartless, terrible person is an imbecile. In an interview, Zooey Deschanel said that the movie was about ""the person before the person you're meant to be with."" And we're not all Paul who date the same girl since 7th grade, the majority of us kiss a few frogs before we find our prince. Unfortunately, Marc Webb makes every girl with a beating heart fall in love with Tom Hansen (and Joseph Gordon-Levitt along with it), so when he is just a frog and not a prince to Summer Finn- you hate her. But that is the beauty of this movie. It is neither cynical nor light-hearted. It is just real. So real that the movie is inspired by a compilation of the writers, etc. personal stories.<br/><br/>Some movies you can watch repeatedly because they are not that good- they are just entertaining so you plop yourself on your couch and get fat over popcorn while watching something you can dream about happening. Some movies- like our beloved Joseph's ""Inception,"" are so incredibly amazing it is difficult to watch it more than once. (500) Days of Summer, however, is different. The movie is so amazing and so well done and so full of life and humor and depression that you can watch it as many times you want and never grow weary of it. And that is why it is my favorite movie. That is why it is my inspiration. That is why you should watch every day until you love every character, even the Chinese family in the bathroom. And that is why you would never know that this movie is a Sundance Film Festival selection."
"maros612","8","0","1","29 January 2011"," Wonderful, powerful but contains oddities
","I usually write a review when a movie touches me. So did this one at times with little bit of greasy hands but for the most part pleasantly after all. <br/><br/>Tom is a laid back guy that studied architecture but doesn't do it and posses an intensive depth of romantic affection. While Tom looks like regular Joe, Summer is is depicted as superb girl, the kind everybody notices and acknowledges the obviousness of her charm and beauty. They both cross each others' path and develop a relationship... <br/><br/>The narration clearly states it's not going to be a love story, whatever that means... As a matter of fact, it is a love story - with two distinct approaches, different motivations and yet the common fields. Their love happens to blend a lot of individual takes and differences into the defining common partnership area, but it's not really all that simple. <br/><br/>The movie is attention drawing and the essence of the main characters is interesting and amusing. The story is trilling enough and it's easy to maintain a feeling you might get surprised. And the movies actually does surprise you, delivering a genuine experience and powerful message. It excels in portraying the full spectrum of individual strongest emotion - love - in an amazing detail. <br/><br/>The movie has an odd splash screen with literally a time-board, where you are brought numerous times during the flick to see ""where are we currently"", on a scale of 1 to 500 days. And oh yes, it goes back and forth as a countryside jukebox. I am not a fan of the non-linear flow which is a key tool of the story-telling in this picture, but it works, (until later on when it's harder to follow). <br/><br/>The movie is very clever in communicative instruments and symbolism, however it fails completely in means of building an atmospheric surrounding. What I had a hard time to tolerate was the constant and pounding feel of something overly artificial, even pathetic. The bitterness of horrible attempts to bring some sort of 80's touch mixed with 60's and what not was present from the beginning 'till end. The movie on one hand clearly sets in presence (thin cellphones and Dell LCD PC screens) while the characters clothes, the hairdos, the office furniture, other people in scenes, interiors, car, music, the business suits people wear etc... are failing to fit into a believable contemporary image. What was it, really!? Tom in one scene plays a portable hand-held video-game (out of view) that emits 8-bit sounds typical for 80ties. The whole vintage factor totally lacks the purpose and any possible sense. It simply acts like it's decades ago, even though it told you it's not. Thus it pretends to lie to you, while it made clear to you it's a lie which is a desperate demonstration of a full blown and carefully perfected non-sense that can only give you a headache. (which you may already have from non-linear jumps) <br/><br/>In one scene you get to see a brief musical-like performance I could have been spared of, thinking it was just too much (people dancing in sync and sing outdoors along the music) but maybe, somebody, somewhere would find that remotely amusing or humorous so I'll be neutral about it.<br/><br/>I am not going to get deeper in the story. You need to watch trough and believe me it's worth it. It's good enough to make up for its flaws. <br/><br/>It is a wonderful movie and you will not regret watching it."

","Its fantastic when you go to watch a film, without actually knowing much about it. Your opinions are open and you are not too sure what to expect. In the case of (500) days of summer, it was a real treat. All I knew about the film, was that it was going to be romantic comedy, but I was so wrong. In fact it was more of an anti romantic comedy that had so much more to offer then a normal ""rom com"".<br/><br/>In (500) days of summer, we are introduced to Tom (Joseph Gorden Levett) who thinks he might be falling in love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel. The problem is that Summer doesn't believe in love. The film follows them through 500 days of their ups, downs and some seriously funny times.<br/><br/>The film is from director Marc Webb. Who is Marc Webb? Well, he certainly has a great talent as he has constructed a complex yet easy to follow love story. The characters are well drawn out and I was impressed by the two lead performances. The film may not be realistic, but it certainly feels it. When looking back over a relationship, we don't remember it all in order. It is the key moments that are remembered which is another strong point about the film. Its ability to jump about the relationship without loosing the audience.The script has plenty of references to other romantic films and even manages to get a dance number in, without it seeming to camp and cheesy. I also loved the soundtrack and went out the buy it days after first watching the film.<br/><br/>A small film with a big aspirations, (500) days of summer is a refreshing film that is full of joy, sadness and heart."

The good was very good too. I loved the plot development and the ending was quite satisfying. Unlike other cynical movies as ""Closer"" or ""Alfie"" it avoids the typical ending of almost all the romantic comedies, but without being cynical or pessimistic.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that make you feel good.

","This film does absolutely nothing wrong. The dialogue is great, the characters and relationships are great, the direction is fantastic, and it's original because it does so many new things of its own that nobody else has done before. It tells its story with pride and dignity and stands for what it believes in. The characters are the same as well. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is top notch here; definitely the best role of his. When both him and Zooey were on-screen together, they were perfect. The chemistry was astounding. When Joseph was his own person, alone on the screen, he stood for something, he was a symbol. His speech in the meeting room of where he works proved that. It went through 500 days fast, but every day shown, you feel that you were with them the whole way through."

","Clever, melancholy, and heartfelt, ""500 Days of Summer"" is an enjoyable romance and voyage into something many people have experienced and can relate to first-hand: heartbreak. It features a fairly simple story that employs the non-linear style of jumping days around to keep the narrative off-base a bit. The story would've been fine either way thanks to Joseph Gordon-Hewitt. His seriousness as in most his movies helps build tension, and makes it easier to empathize what his character is going through. I enjoyed the backgrounds and interests of the various characters and the interesting side-stories at the Greeting Card Office. As with too many movies these days, music gets overused, but luckily it doesn't get too folksy, the genre that really becomes disagreeable for my tastes. Nonetheless the movie runs a brisk 90 min or so, but still feels sufficiently introspective. Recommended."

She just wasn't in love with him. That doesn't make her bad. Aside from one instance where she stupidly left out some important information, Summer stayed true to her personality and to her word. Tom was just too infatuated to listen. He thought he could change the person he loved......which is usually wrong.<br/><br/>Both characters were caring and flawed, and that's why I liked them so much.

","When you see a trailer for a rom-com these days you can often predict the plot and the lame jokes of the whole film. But 500 Days of Summer is different and shows what a real relationship is like, not some sort of idealised version.<br/><br/>Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young man who works at a greetings card company, who falls for his boss' new assistant, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). Both have shared interests in music but Tom is an old romantic, believing in love and that Summer is the one, whilst Summer does not believe in love and not into relationships. The film tells the highs and lows of the 500 days Tom knows Summer and the perfect girl may not be the right girl.<br/><br/>Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber write a very funny, fresh script, with first-time director Marc Webb making it in a stylist, fast paced film. The dialogue was funny, but grounded, stuff that people would really say, adding to the humour. The situation is something we all would have faced, we have idealised someone we liked, focusing on all the good aspects, think they are perfect and end up heartbroken when it does not work out. With the nonlinear style it was almost like a Quentin Tarrantino style film (with a lot less bloodshed); allowing us to see at different stage what happened to the couple and how event could have a different mean when looked from a different angle. The characters are natural and real, particularly with what they say, how they act and dress. Webb and the writers avoid clichés as much as possible.<br/><br/>Webb injects real some style into the film: he keeps a quirky nature throughout the films, with little tricks like flashbacks about Summer, the cut scenes of when Tom describes what he likes (and hates) about Summer and to the use of animation. This is one type of film a first time director should be being, inventive, focusing on characters and a simple but strong story (and it can work in any genre). If a director is lumbered with a big project as their first film they do not have the experience, they have not yet developed their knowledge and are usually just a gun-for-hire. Webb also does not use a traditional score and simply uses songs, adding the indie nature of the film.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel were a convicting couple. It is easy to relate to Tom's situation, falling for someone who does not feel the same way, thought I am more likely to agree with Summer's view on love. Tom is a typical man whilst Summer is a indie chick and even when she is a bitch you just can't help but love her. Their performances are natural and believable throughout. The supporting cast is also good, from Tom's friends, one of them being overly eager and likes to drink, McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) who had a been in a long term relationship. His boss (Clark Gregg) is even made out to be a decent guy. However there was not enough of Chloe Moretz, who was a smart, wise-beyond her years girl who offers the best advise. Moretz is clearly going to be a force to be reckoned with in the future.<br/><br/>A fine, entertaining little film."

","Unlike most romantic comedies, 500 days of Summer speaks of something more real than just boy meets girl, it speaks of a simple relationship and nothing more special than that. While it may sound uninteresting you'd be surprised its much more entertaining, combining two distinct minds, Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), believing in true love and fate and that he'd never be happy 'til he meet his soul mate, while Summer did not believe in love nor fate, and they simply get together out of simple fun. Having an interesting way to express what love may really be or what it even is.

","Here is a rom-com with a number of differences, starting with the title. This Summer is not a season (even Los Angeles does not have that much sun) but a girl (the cute Zooey Deschanel) amorously pursued by Tom (talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt), both of whom work for a greeting cards company trading on triteness. The structure of the narrative is terribly post-modern in being non-chronological and the genre is subverted in not following the conventional formula. The final major novelty is a series of intersected cinematic flourishes such as - my favourites - an open-air dance sequence of triumph and a split screen depicting expectation and reality.<br/><br/>At the heart of the movie's success is a clever script from Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. The film begins with the disclaimer: ""Any resemblance to people living or dead is purely coincidental ... Especially you, Jenny Beckman ... Bitch."" but Neustadter has admitted that the story was based on a real romance that he experienced while studying at the London School of Economics. The departure from the conventional rom-com resolution and the sense of authenticity imbue this entertaining tale with an element of reality as well as much hilarity."
"poweller","9","0","1","1 September 2010"," 500 Days Of Sublime Summer
","On the face of it 500 Days of Summer is just another 'rom-com'. Another boy meets girl, falls in love..you know the rest. Yet, as the film begins, 'you should know this is not a love story', you realise 500 Days of Summer is so much more and in my opinion one of the best films of the last couple of years.<br/><br/>As with most of the best films the concept is hardly rocket science. To sum it up the film follows Tom Hanson (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his on/off relationship with Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel)over a period of 500 days. Yet whilst the majority of 'rom coms' these days seem to seek their laughs from placing there characters in a series of increasingly fantastical situations, it is the sheer mundaneness of the situations Tom and Summer find themselves in that really makes this film work. For instance a shopping trip to Ikea, a visit to a modern art exhibition or just the sheer fact they met in the bland environment of the workplace.<br/><br/>Both Gordon-Levitt are and Deschanel are excellent in there roles and it is hard to imagine anyone else playing there characters. However what elevates the film from 'good' to 'great' is the way it is still able to pack an emotional punch, grounding the characters in a sense of reality. Because the scenes are spliced together, almost like random snippets of conversation in a diary, it allows the director to follow up scenes of happiness and joy with ones of angst and heartbreak, making it gloriously unpredictable and just like the ups and downs of real life.<br/><br/>If you are looking for any flaws you could argue the ending is a little below par, not quite as quirky or original as the previous 90 minutes, but this is a minor blemish on an otherwise fantastic picture. It is also worth pointing out the music of the Smiths, Regina Spektor consistently fits perfectly and I challenge anyone not to want to tap there feet when we get Tom's big dance number after his first date with Summer."
"starzinhereyes7","6","0","1","18 August 2010"," Oscillates between original poignancy and trite sentimentality
","Intentionally or not, the makers (500) Days of Summer – why do we need those parentheses? – were trying to make an updated Annie Hall. Interestingly, though, the male lead in Annie Hall suffers from the neuroticism of children who grew up during World War II, whereas Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) suffers from romantic delusions and expectations of children raised on Disney movies and romantic comedies (specifically, Tom misinterpreted The Graduate as a child). Annie Hall isn't the only film 500 Days of Summer brings to mind. Zooey Deschanel plays the Summer Finn, who seems like a watered-down version of Kate Winslet's character in Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind – her hair color isn't turning any heads, but she still gets her kicks from sweetly screaming dirty words in public parks. The two films also go back in forth between post-break up misery and pre-break up joy. There's even a little bit of Little Miss Sunshine, with Chloe Moretz as Tom's sassy but wise little sister. <br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer, in trying to be as original as the three films mentioned, ends up oscillating between insightful observations and self-conscious sentimentality. The film tells the rarely told story of a relationship in which the girl cannot bring herself to love the likable boy as much as he loves her. It happens often enough in real life, as romantic desperation leads members of both genders to see love in themselves and in others where it just doesn't exist. It's too bad that the poignant core of the film is clouded indie-film tropes. Take for instance that Gordon-Levitt works in a greeting card company, even though he dreams of becoming an architect. Of course, any character that isn't pursuing his dream job is in dire need of a wake-up call. Telling an indie film crowd this is like telling doctors that medicine is the noblest profession. Deschanel's character would be wholly unoriginal if Deschenal wasn't herself an interesting actress. She's strikingly pretty. She's independent but feminine. She'd be the dream girl if she didn't give off the vibe of someone who's careless with other people's emotions. It's hard not to like and even envy her, whereas I didn't care for Gordon-Levitt's character. He's supposed to be the relatable romantic, but I thought he was too self-absorbed and whiny to cheer for. Moments meant to show his charm reeked of ""Ain't I cute?"" The screenwriters based the film on true events, which adds a sense of realism to some of the scenes, but also a sense of self-glorification to the film and to Gordon-Levitt's character in particular. (500) Days of Summer is entertaining and relatable, but it annoyed me more than it blew me away."

","Some movies, I enjoy thoroughly but would be hard pressed to watch them again. Every now and then a rare thing will happen where a movie has this irresistible charm and can be viewed repeatedly. 500 Days of summer is such a movie. From the first frame, I knew this movie was for me. I love quirky characters and indie soundtracks, so it not be an exaggeration to say the movie won me over at the beginning. The story is something anyone can relate too. Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl is indifferent and despite seeming like the one, further scrutiny would tell a different story. I thought the two man actors, Joseph and Zooey had amazing chemistry. Their uncomfortable moments made me uncomfortable, their tender moments put a smile on my face, etc. I just felt the portrayal of a relationship was spot on, warts and all, without coming off as cheesy or smoothed over. Plus, the smith nods? :) I love this movie!! There are no villains, and I think this is the sign of a great work when instead of finger pointing, it relates that sometimes things do not work out and it is nobody's fault. I know a lot of people will hate Summer and her character, but by the end, I felt happy to know she was happy and saw Joseph's character accept her resolve, and say that he wants her to be happy. Beautiful. Saying to someone you've loved you wish them happiness outside of your embrace, that takes immeasurable strength. The moment had me in tears, because it is rare you are able to see such poignant grace. 10/10<br/><br/>PS The Regina Spektor song at the beginning owns my life, I love the soundtrack to this movie. :) x5"
"webmaster-3017","9","0","1","5 April 2010"," HK Neo Reviews: (500) Days of Summer
","Coincidence or fate...<br/><br/>Years ago, I remember roaming across an old book shop, inside, there is an antique book titled: ""We do not remember the time, but we remember the moments."" 500 Days of Summer is exactly that. The movie plays like random moments of recollected memories. In essence, the timing of each event is totally irrelevant. They are simply memories of what we remembered happened. It is rare that a Hollywood romantic drama steer away from the cliché syndrome. It is a kind of movie that makes you love movies. In some stage of our lives, we will all probably have met someone like Summer. A type of girl that likes you, but you know will never be with you. Some call it fate, some call it lust, some call it coincidence, and I call it timing. It is a love story without all the elements of one. 500 Days of Summer succeeds in giving the audience a movie about something tangible, something understandable and something to ponder about.<br/><br/>The movie goes like this: A girl meets boy. Boy falls for girl. Girl likes the boy. The two goes closer. The boy wants a relationship. The girl wants something else. Life is wrecked and it's time to see how the boy deals with it in 500 days of summer...<br/><br/>What is so beautiful about this movie is that the director puts you directly into Tom's character shoes. It is lovely, bittersweet and knowing. Movies like these do not come along too often, but like a failed romantic encounter, it actually plays out like one. Beautiful yet bittersweet are the feelings involved. Whether you like it or not, one just has to learn to accept it. It reminds me of the time when I met a girl on the plane. From there we smashed all the right buttons. Then suddenly one day, the girl decides to pops up the words of wisdom in the lines of ""I don't want a boyfriend"". Sometime in life, you just have to realise that there will never be an answer to every question. We will just have learn from it, make yourself a better person, enjoy life a little more and just treasure those past beautiful memories and move on. I never asked why. I just walked away and never saw the girl again. It lasted two months.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom into a real character, someone we can all relate to. While his chemistry with Summer seems real enough, there is something about the two, that only the audience or a bystander will realise. They are clearly not compatible. Yet, Tom persists. Perhaps, Summer puts it perfectly by the end of the film: ""With you, I just never knew."" In essence, love is not meant to reason with or requires an explanation. The moment you are required to explain why and how and what, it becomes an excuse or thinking there is a reason. Summer played perfectly by Zooey Deschanel. Zooey may seem like she knows exactly what she wants. In reality, that is not the case. She is not the pretty type, but there is something about her attitude, the eyes and something about her that makes her a distant yet fascinating character.<br/><br/>All in all, (500) Days of Summer is not your norm Hollywood romance drama. It's like the same feeling as the moment you remember about the last time; you encounter a similar event or situation. It is sad that they don't make more movies like this. While not all romance are bitter. It goes back to a saying: ""failures are what we learn from"". So it goes back to the interpretation of love. The movie seems to say that there are no such things as miracle, meant to be or even fate. Love is all pure coincidence. Maybe in my view, it sounds a tad more optimistic, in the notion of timing. I once told a girl, ""If you don't want to see me again, I will just walk away"". Perhaps, like (500) days of Summer, it was just not meant to be...(Neo 2010) <br/><br/>I rate it 9/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"

","As a man there is nothing worse than being dragged to the cinema to see some generic, identikit, thought free rom com. I have seen a few in my time, the worst being The Holiday (the relationship I was in came to an end a few days later, enough said!) So it was with great trepidation that I went to see this film with the young lady I was dating at the time.<br/><br/>Not another boy meets girl, boy gets girl, girl breaks boys heart, boy gets back together with girl and they all live happily ever after story. Please not another one of those. It isn't. This is a film with a twist - that twist being that this is not the happy ever after relationship we are so used to seeing. This is one of the other relationships; those that make us feel like they are forever after but, in reality, are steps on the road to where we have to get.<br/><br/>The story itself is very simple. Tom is the sort of guy that falls head over heels in love very easily. Summer is the sort of girl that can have any man she wants but is guarded and has commitment issues. Their coming together is gradual and the sequential nature of the film allows the relationship to be developed much more naturally. It felt like a much more organic process, as it is most of the time in real life. It gave the story a great element of realism, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>As the story develops it becomes ever more apparent that this is not the idealistic relationship that Tom considers it to be. The little flaws in character that we all have show themselves through the course of the 500 days and we, before Tom, realise that Summer is never going to be the great love he perceives her to be.<br/><br/>The nature of the film lets us know in advance that they are going to split up and when that time comes the contrast in how the main characters deal with it puts up a mirror to their clashing personalities and the very reasons why they could not be together.<br/><br/>The film moves on and we see how their lives pan out. She meets and marries someone in what seems to be super quick time. He wallows in self pity (thats what Morrisey will do to you) but rediscovers his passions in life. The ending is a little too sugary for my liking but the point remains that these two characters met, fell for each other, realised it was not going to work and parted. They each took something positive away from the relationship even if it took Tom a long time (the bulk of the 500 days!) to discover this.<br/><br/>So there we go. Not a romance at all. Rather an all too uncommon look at those relationships that shape us; those people that mean so much at the time but who ultimately are not meant to be in our lives forever but whose impact will stay.<br/><br/>Incidentally the relationship I was in when I watched this for the first time did not last. Whereas I blame The Holiday for the former, I do not blame 500 Days for the latter. Indeed, it speaks volumes to me and was a rather snug fit for where my own life was at the time.<br/><br/>The film falls short on a couple of points. As mentioned, I found Zooey Deschanel a little wooden at times. I know the character was void of emotion (not entirely but to an extent) but even her happy face seemed strained. The supporting cast, whilst doing their jobs perfectly, were instantly forgettable but I think that is because Joseph Gordon-Levitt played such a strong Tom. The ending was a little sugary sweet and my concern was that Tom, having learned his lessons and having got his life back on track, would make the same mistake again.<br/><br/>But so would I. Autumn was smoking!!"

In this movie, it was pretty clear that Summer was unsure of relationships and the slippery subject of love. <br/><br/>i love how honest this movie is. There are just so, so many parallels between what happened to me recently and what happened in this movie. Even though there are drastic differences (duh) like how I'm a girl but totally understand Tom's feelings like, all throughout the movie, I think this movie is a great representation of something that apparently happens all the time. <br/><br/>I think that if I hadn't experienced what I did recently, I wouldn't have liked this movie nearly as much. or at least understood it. I desperately needed something to cheer me up. Alongside the great ""capturing"" of this event that happens all the time, I actually loved the delightful, silly little pieces of comic relief like how Tom ends up describing again Summer's appearance -- like how her birthmark changed from a heart to a cockroach and so on.<br/><br/>i also love how certain things got put into perspective. I have to agree. a lot of our conception of ""love"" comes from pop culture or what other people tell you about it, and we let ourselves believe it and a lot of the times we end up expecting way, way too much. songs, movies, books, television, greeting cards... I think one of my favorite scenes was where Tom spoke out right before he quit his job.<br/><br/>I suppose I got from this movie, as I had been drowning myself in self-pity, irritability, lethargy and utter hate, is how it spoke to me. I try to vent on other people but didn't get feedback that was quite as helpful as what I got from this movie -- it's rather difficult. talking to him obviously didn't help (i really shouldn't talk to him if i want to get over him), my peers might not have gone through the same thing, and everyone else really doesn't know the whole story, even if i try to tell them everything that happened as accurately as possible. it's still possible that my explanations can totally distort what really happened...<br/><br/>so really. except for the very ending, (opportunities don't come quite that easily or that quickly, honestly.) which I can see that I suppose they just wanted to end on a kind of happy note -- it's a great movie."

","Few of the things I loved about the movie, well to start with were the characters, I mean the actors. The two lead performers: Joseph Gordon-Levitt—whom I saw in a psychologically captivating drama ""Mysterious Skin"", where he really brilliantly exhumed an unlikely role which perfectly projected what the film meant truly. Zooey Deschanel, well this is the first time I saw her, but I've been anticipating watching her movie together with Aaron Stanford in their comedic duo Flakes (Aaron Stanford's films were always friggin rare to get!), had performed very well her witty role. When I was observing how Gordon-Levitt pulled his performance, I got to say this man has a hell of a talent. His acting has something rarely brilliant in it that you want to sit still on your couch how this man could trigger the interesting feat, but well talking about his acting is another long story. Zooey Deschanel was incredibly funny too. I never imagined how she ""unconsciously-convincingly"" deliver her lines were you get to analyze its funny, though her character never meant it to be that way. I was entranced how the movie progressed, very interesting admittedly. There may be flaws but I hardly notice them anyway, getting entertained about the story and thickness of the plot is what's important. All in all this isn't at all an average romantic comedy you would lovely share with your partner, friends or family. It's really worthwhile. It's simple and complicatedly brilliant in its own way. Rather than indulging with highly-budgeted, misinterpreted romantic comedy films out there, it's a penny worth to see this, trust me."

","8.5<br/><br/>""It's these cards and the movies and the pop songs, they're to blame for all lies and the heartache, everything."" There are many love stories and so called ""chick flicks"" out there. There are just as many romance novels and soap operas. One thing in common with all these works is that, the common theme, love, is discovered, lost, and then regained, usually with the same person, or ""the right person"". This is essential to story telling, given that it is all fictional work, used for self reflection. Audiences will feel some form of regret spending their time and investing their emotions into the film, or whatever it may be, if the ending falls short and the protagonist (or group of them) do not triumph in the end. In this genre, the villain is loneliness, or lack of love.<br/><br/>(500) Days of Summer is not too different from the other works in its genre. However, it tries to be, and does succeed in doing so. The film constantly brings up, like the aforementioned quote, that these films or whatever it may be paint a pretty picture of the real experience of love and relationships. Usually, you expect for there to be a good ending, where the protagonist, like a child, is comforted. There is nothing wrong with expecting a positive conclusion in life. However, a relationship involving young people usually does not last a lifetime. And the realistic conclusion, is that one should not expect everything to return to their former ways, but one should accept the changes and gather experience from it. There is a scene in the film where the expectations of the young man and the reality of the situation is contrasted side by side. It is basically the context of the entire film. It knows its role as a film about love, and tries to offer you more realism.<br/><br/>This is director Marc Webb's first full length film. I didn't know this, and wouldn't have guessed it while watching the film. He is definitely one to keep an eye on, as he displays some talent in (500) Days of Summer. The story is told from the perspective of the man. Though the film jumps back and forth through time very often and too quickly for my taste, it still manages to maintain the right energy between the jumps, and you can always tell a huge difference between the different time periods in the life of the relationship. Just as the graphic preceding the time jumps show the concept of seasons, with a tree blooming and its leaves shrinking and losing color, you can just as well tell the difference in the environments, faces and emotions of the actors (mainly the protagonist). Light narration is needed, as everyone does their job in telling the story. I wouldn't say that the film is near-perfect in any sense of the term in its ability to output the emotions of the characters, but it is in no way mediocre either.<br/><br/>It's true, there are many clichés in (500) Days of Summer. Most of the plot, and the events and characters in it you've probably all ready seen before, especially if you're fond of the genre. However, chances are there's a reason why you keep coming back to the genre, and I am happy to announce that (500) Days of Summer offers a fresh enough perspective on it that you will enjoy. The movie tries to be different. It tries to offer you a larger dose of reality to go with your ""chick flick"", ""love story"" fix. And it manages to do so, with style, too. It's also worth mentioning, like the movie does, that this is a modern film. The characters belong in contemporary settings. Ultimately, I'd recommend this film first of all if you're looking to find new and promising directors. But to summarize the film, I will quote it itself, when it said, ""This is not a love story. It is a story about love."""

","I give this an 8, considering the genre.<br/><br/>It's a g-ddamn cute film, okay? I could have done without the little kid sh-t, but Zooey Deschanel is cute (and also extremely fine), and that Joseph Gordon-Leavitt kid is cute, too. I liked the cute musical number, and the humor often ventured into clever, even mocking and abstract areas. But that was probably due to the original structure of the story So, not everything was cute. But still pretty cute. Also, the ending wasn't what I expected. Maybe a little bleaker would have been nice, but the movie had to sustain its cuteness to a certain degree. Basically, anything's better than the type of wet, stenching, bio-hazardous hobo discharge that passes for romantic comedy these days, and this one wins points for imagination and Deschanel."

","(500) Days is a rom-com disguised as a heartfelt drama. Or vice versa. It's one of the few films I have seen which has made me laugh to stitches and nearly made me cry. In short, it's good.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt oozes class in this anti-love story, fitting solidly into the role of bored greetings card writer Tom. Zooey Deschanel is also terrific as Tom's object of affection, looking beautiful and acting well. The two leads are fantastic, even if some may think the film is not worth-while, and with skilled direction from Marc Webb, this film succeeds where so many others have failed; it's funny, sad, gripping, heartfelt and extremely enjoyable.<br/><br/>A top music score helps this film a lot, setting the mood perfectly. True film and music fans will appreciate the quirky, artistic (if slightly pretentious) style, and will excuse the fact that it is a run-of-the-mill indie flick at heart. At times it may seem a bit too art-house, but you'll end up forgiving the film in the long run for generally putting you in a feel-good mood.<br/><br/>Definitely one to watch."
"bournefootball","10","0","1","5 February 2010"," 500 Days is the surprise hit of the Summer...
","(500) Days of Summer is one of the best films of the year so far, let's get that out of the way up front. It's a movie that is real about romance, but not overtly cynical or anything like that. What first time feature director Marc Webb has done is create (with the help of a nomination worthy original screenplay by scribes Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber) a portrait of how one man sees his relationship with a girl named Summer. This is both a life affirming and heart breaking movie, and it's rare that those are one and the same. Combine that with subtle yet free flowing direction, great acting, and the best soundtrack of the year so far, and what we have here is a real winner. <br/><br/>The movie details essentially the 500 days that Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) knows Summer (Zooey Deschanel). This includes much more than just the standard meet, fall in love, and live happily ever after aspects that most traditional boy meets girl movies entail. This has far more going on than that. For one, Tom and Summer don't end up together (this isn't a spoiler, so no worries). The film is presented with a fractured narrative that skips around and is told solely from Tom's perspective, so the unreliable narrator technique is in effect as well. The movie is almost a post mortem on a relationship that, at least in Tom's eyes, was love at first sight.<br/><br/>First and foremost, this movie succeeds because of the two lead performances. Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are doing some of the finest work of their careers and they make their characters people we know (and perhaps even are). Gordon-Levitt plays Tom as a modern day hopeless romantic, well aware of the silliness of believing in storybook romances, but he does anyway. He also has to display the full gamut of emotions, as he has to play Tom as longing for Summer, being overjoyed at being with Summer, loving Summer, hating Summer, missing Summer, and so on. It's a tough role that he hits a home run with. Deschanel is just as good with an even harder role. She's not so much playing a character as she inhabits Tom's current view of this thing we know of as Summer. On rare occasions we might be seeing hints at the ""real Summer"", but for the most part she's portraying what he currently thinks of her. Both actors are always good, but here, they're both fantastic and essay memorable roles that are worthy of being remembered come awards time.<br/><br/>Director Webb is playful with his movie, but never loses control. He knows exactly the movie he wants to make (a mix of such diverse films as Juno, Annie Hall, Memento, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, High Fidelity, Manhattan, Garden State, and The Graduate) and never hits a wrong note. Even the things that could normally be a detractor in a ""quirky"" movie like this, such as dream sequences, song and dance, animation, weird friends, a second narrator who pops in here and there and is not a character in the film otherwise, a little girl wise beyond her years, and split-screen are handled perfectly, so the movie is instead better for their presence. It really is a perfect match of director and script.<br/><br/>By being somewhat of a scrapbook about the 500 days that Tom interacts with Summer, the film presents itself as a series of memories about Summer from Tom's point of view. We are never sure if everything is the exact truth (on more than one occasion, we may or may not be seeing what really happens), and that creates an interesting feeling while viewing the flick. The movie wants to be about the moments in between what most generic films show to audiences, and it's a complete success at doing so. It's almost as if we're with Tom as he recounts this to us, his memory skewed by personal history and his current mood. It all sounds more complicated then it is, but it's this type of creativity and uniqueness that makes (500) Days of Summer the brilliant experience that it is.<br/><br/>What I love about this movie so much is that it's realistic about relationships and the crapshoot nature that they tend to be. Men and women may view this movie very differently since it's from Tom's perspective, but everyone will no doubt see a bit of themselves in this movie. Whether you've been jilted in love, are happily in love, miss the one that got away, or none of the above, the film will speak to you in some small way. (500) Days of Summer will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you smile, and it will make you think. Most of all it will make you appreciate the fine work of cinema that it is. The movie is an Oscar dark horse, so keep an eye out for it, but take it from me, this is a masterpiece that you will no doubt treasure and remember as one of the finest films of 2009."

","Immediately, the narrator informs the viewer that (500) Days of Summer is not a love story. He sticks to his word. Throughout the movie, the viewer digests this movie as rather a story about love. A very unbalanced love at that, and how love can go wrong. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt plays Tom, a man who works at a greeting card factory, but dreams of becoming an architect. Tom falls in love with a miss in vintage clothing and an unforgettable personality, also known as Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel. It takes a little karaoke and a little getting to know each other for Summer to start feeling something for Tom. Although, she makes it clear from the beginning that she is ""not looking for anything serious."" Tom, a sap for her beauty and personality, rapidly over looks this desire of hers, and continues in pursuing Summer's desire for him.<br/><br/>This movie is the anti-romantic of stories about love. Tom continues to chase this semi-bohemian girl, who could manipulate anyone to give her anything she wants with her cute and quirkiness, who ends up leaving him. Although, surprisingly not depressing, this movie takes you all across the board. Tom goes to all lengths to get her back, and forget her. <br/><br/>Deschanel continues to play vibrant characters such as her previous role in Yes Man, and her role as Summer in this movie was enjoyable to watch. As the movie went on, it was definitely displeasing, but by then end I found myself craving more. Marc Webb, the director, really replenishes our system with absolute love for the characters, but also reality. As we continue to see the hopeless romantic movies spilling out into theaters one after another, this movie sets a revitalizing tone for the viewers that makes you ache with love for the movie by the end. <br/><br/>Marc Webb did a great job with (500) Days of Summer, which needs to be applauded. He, at first, fell into the typical romantic comedy, but immediately took a turn for the better. The movie was put together with amazing balance. A standing ovation for Mr. Webb, Zooey Deschanel, and Joseph Gordon Levitt."

All along during this fun soul searching journey it shows and proves just how complex and unpredictable that love and romance can be.<br/><br/>This is a film that's mostly told and done thru flashback memory it centers around a young man Tom(Joseph Gordon-Levitt)who's a lonely greeting card writer and he says being alone is okay yeah right! As like any man he's searching for the girl of his dreams enter a new co-worker Summer Finn(Zooey Deschanel)and she may just be the right one. Along the way the film looks at the happenings and often offbeat times of their relationship during a 500 day period often showing times from days that's not in no particular sequence. These times happen to consist of fun and unpredictable turns.<br/><br/>After this long journey it proves one thing in the end that love and finding a relationship is unexpected as proved with Summer it's not often meant.

","Such a good movie. It was so different from the usual RomComs. There wasn't that expected sugar sweet storyline. Most movies of this genre you know that the two lovers will begin super happy then something will happen to split them up and then right before the end of the movie they get back together, destined for one another. 500 days of Summer was more realistic I thought. <br/><br/>It was so good, from the music, to the comedic relief to well everything. I found it intriguing how apathetic yet hedonistic Summer seemed to be most of the time. It was interesting how her parents divorce has such an effect on her yet Tom was just fine. It was almost a role reversal with how Tom was the one desperate for true love and Summer was fully resigned about it. I think that was really broadcasted when they were in the diner and Summer identified with Sid Vicious and labeled Tom as Nancy. <br/><br/>I liked how connected you seemed to be with Tom. Almost like Summer was rejecting you along with Tom, and at the end with Autumn, like you were getting a second chance at love along with Tom. <br/><br/>Anyways, I could watch this movie a million times over, and I can't say that about many movies."

","An old cliché (yet not uninteresting one) is ""Would you want to know when you were going to die?"" This film, as noted elsewhere presents a dead relationship, well before its demise. And so for some folks, that death will feel protracted.<br/><br/>The pace and editing however make the film nowhere near so anguishing. The movie makers jump across time liberally, helping to juxtapose the sweet and sour parts of a relationship in an often humorous way. This is much better than a film split into halves with a ""He Saw, She Saw"" divide.<br/><br/>Many women will enjoy the film as they get to see the man in a relationship suffer (not to be too glib, but I think I'm not too off the mark here.) Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Tom is the inverse of the bad boy girls aren't supposed to love, but they do. Tom is sweet, shy and often nearly as cute as a puppy. And he adores Summer.<br/><br/>Many men will like this as Zooey Deschanel's Summer character is cute and a bit of a wounded bird. Yet she also has surprising pluck and crucially she initiates the romance (read sex?) despite Tom's initial awkward cluelessness. Also, her character...like many objects of affection...is not really clearly seen, mysterious and open for projections by Tom (and the male audience/Zooey zealots).<br/><br/>Many men and women will like this film as I do think we are set up to hope/look for the whirlwind romance when we are young. Such love is tough to find, much less sustain. Or in this case, tough to architect such love with just one of the two willing to do the heavy lifting. <br/><br/>Ah mirage of youth...<br/><br/>Anyways, the film here is getting rave reviews, and honestly I found myself carried along with the film mostly. <br/><br/>Spoilers start...<br/><br/>I am mildly fascinated, if not relieved, by the discussion posted on the boards here that the last meeting with Summer was all in Tom's head. Just a function of his ""actualization"" or what-have-you. More than the season change at the very end though, other parts of the film irked me. For example...<br/><br/>1) The savvy little sister. <br/><br/>2) The plate breaking (which led to a sister scene). <br/><br/>3) The greeting card lampooning. Although the solo ovation from his buddy maybe indicated they were lampooning themselves. Nah... The film is just thinner than it feels.<br/><br/>I know that Tom's epiphany is what the film is all about, that and the fact that love, like trummerflora, can bloom again. I find myself a little curious about Summer's epiphany, all we get is Dorian Gray and then a wedding dress?<br/><br/>Like your first love, maybe enjoy this film while you watch it, and then prepare to move on?<br/><br/>6.5/10<br/><br/>Thurston Hunger"

","(500) DAYS OF SUMMER is a refreshing bit of fluff about the dance of contemporary courting - with a twist. Writers Scott Neustader and Michael H. Weber demonstrate a keen understanding of the bumpy road of romance and have been able to make a film that balances humor and tenderness very well. Director Marc Webb encourages his two fine lead actors to give performances that could just be career boosts for both. <br/><br/>Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a completely different role than his usual stereotype) is an architect whose line in the job seeking market landed him in the greeting card business, writing inane messages for silly cards. Feeling as though he will never meet the girls of his dreams, he encounters Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), a pretty if somewhat evasive and odd girl with her own concept of 'relationships'. Egged on by his friends McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) as well as his very bright 'therapist' little sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz), Tom approaches Summer in a courtship that lasts for 500 days - only some of which are rewarding. It is a back and forth game of ping pong, with Tom the obsessed pursuer and Summer the feather in the wind. There really is no particular linear story here, but instead a series of wonderful vignettes that allow Gordon- Levitt and Deschanel to shine as actors. Webb interweaves drawings with photography in an especially winning way and allows the ping pong ball to bounce to and fro between periods of time in this thwarted courtship. This is not a deep movie, but it is a well designed and acted look at love among the young today. The performances by the lead actors justify visiting this little treasure. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","The opening narration states ""this is not a love story"" but that is just to throw us off. It is a story of love, but told in an unusual, and interesting way.<br/><br/>The ""Summer"" of the title is a girl, Summer Finn. It is this young man's tale of his 500 days of knowing her, and yet not really knowing her at all.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is good as the somewhat nerdy, unambitious Tom Hansen who works for a card company, writing clever sayings. He is pretty good at it, but really wanted to be an architect. However his ambitions seem pretty low.<br/><br/>One day Zooey Deschanel as pretty, interesting, and quirky Summer Finn comes into the office. Tom pretty much views her as unapproachable, but she makes the first ""chit-chat"" and soon they are friends. And maybe more, but she cautions him early that she isn't interested in something deeper. She seems to like to float along in life, enjoy what it gives, without worrying too much about where it may lead.<br/><br/>But Tom is confused by this, because ""friends"" don't just jump in the bed and make out, or decide on the spur of the moment to have sex in the shower.<br/><br/>A cute addition to the story is 11 year old Chloe Moretz as Rachel Hansen, Tom's little sister, who often sits him down and gives him advice, some of it coming as she waits for her soccer coach to put her into the game. She is wise beyond her years, as Tom seems naive below his years.<br/><br/>The story is told back and forth in time, and they use a nice mechanism to keep us aware of time, they superimpose a small display that tells us what day during the 500 it is every time a scene changes.<br/><br/>The story depicts a real truth about love and relationships. No matter how ideal this new person is for YOU, it will not work out unless you are equally ideal for her. Tom spends much of his relationship energy ignoring all the reasons why Summer will NOT likely be his mate for life and instead hoping she will change. It just doesn't happen.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: After the on-again, off-again affair, Tom is invited to Summer's but not only finds that she does not intend to be his forever, she is getting engaged that very occasion. He rushes out, devastated, holes up in his place for days, becomes bitter, even finally goes to work, makes trouble, and quits. But something gets him to drawing again, and he renews his interest in architecture. He gets organized, sets up interviews, polishes his resume'. As the movie is about to end he is waiting for his interview and meets a nice young lady. She is also interviewing for the job. They each hope the other DOESN'T get it, and smile about that. But they do talk about getting coffee afterward, perhaps this next one will be the one for Tom. After all her name is Autumn, and everyone knows when Summer ends Autumn takes her place."

I was charmed, I laughed, and (as corny as it sounds) it really is a feel-good film. I liked the approaches it took story-wise, and the style in which some things are conveyed. The chemistry between the leads is actually there, and not phoned-in by random celebrity A and B like in most romantic comedies. In fact, I don’t really know if 500 Days of Summer should be considered a romantic comedy. Sure, those two elements are there, but it delves into deeper meanings and its characters far more than some of the mainstream crap to come out this year. Overall, this is a really believable film, one that I really connected with and loved every moment of.

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a mopey man in his early twenties, working a soulless job at a greeting card company. His life is pretty meaningless until he meets Zooey Deschanel. They share an affinity for The Smiths. They do zany things like pretend that Ikea is their personal living room and generally flirt with each other.<br/><br/>It's a pretty good film overall, I was quite surprised I liked this. The writing was pretty sharp and Deschanel who is usually pretty annoying seemed to be a little more restrained in this movie. Gordon-Levitt is good as well. These are probably the types of movies he should be making instead of crap like Killshot where he was almost laughable as a petty criminal.<br/><br/>Maybe this the movie which epitomizes everyone's early 20s or at least their post-university life. You want to tell Gordon-Levitt to stop being so damn mopey in this movie but there's really no hope, you know everyone has to go through something like this and he plays the role pretty well in this movie.<br/><br/>The Graduate features prominently in the movie and with good reason because this movie is somewhat similar to that one. It also dealt with a mopey man out of college falling in love with the wrong girl.

","Marc Webb's '(500) Days of Summer' is an intriguing analysis of the effect of a breakup on a young man, Tom Hansen. There have been many films on breakups but this film has a whimsical rhythm to it and isn't overly polished or saccharine.<br/><br/>However, I missed that it didn't focus much on Summer. She inadvertently appears as the 'bad guy' because all we see of her is how well she's doing after the breakup. Nothing about her own struggles or conflicts is even mentioned. This is understandable since the narration was from Tom's point of view but I would have liked to see Summer's perspective as well. Another flaw was the sequences with Tom's little sister. This really takes away from the character because does a smart guy like him really need a little a twelve year old's advice (whose ideas are most likely based on the movies she has seen)? I suppose this was meant to be charming but it failed to work for me.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a good fit, with an interesting set of songs that fit well with the situations. The choice of locations are impressive too. Joseph Gordon-Levitt carries the film. It's been a while since I've seen his movies (where he plays a lead role) but he proves again what a capable actor he is. The incredibly beautiful Zooey Deschanel plays Summer naturally. She's charming, spirited, vivacious and energetic. Both Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt share wonderful chemistry. The supporting cast do well too.<br/><br/>Overall, '(500) Days of Summer' is a likable movie. The characters you meet are real rather than the stereotypical guy and girl one has so often witnessed in cinema. One is very likely to recognize Summer and Tom either as themselves or someone they have known. Further, there are some great lines that highlight the humour and contribute to the whimsy."

Why? Because the message the movie sends out explains pretty much life in general.<br/><br/>Stuff just happens....yup, how true is that? The plot is a down on his luck greeting card writer named Tom (played brilliantly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a miserable so and so until he meets the mysterious Summer Finn (also played brilliantly by Zooey Deschanel) and this is where the fun begins.<br/><br/>He spends half the movie trying to get with her, a middle portion of the movie with her and pretty much the end trying to get over her. Anyone who's had a woman (or a man) that you can't explain but just can't get over can identify with almost every situation that happens in the movie.<br/><br/>I'll give away everything and say right here, that midway through the movie Summer just ups and breaks up with Tom...which drives Tom over the edge into insanity. This insanity also fires him up to leave his crummy job and go into what he really wants to be, an architect. We then find out that Summer has gotten married in the months she's been away from Tom. Which leads us to the end scene which explains pretty much life. Tom is now an architect sitting where he and Summer once hung out and she happens to sit there with him. He then asks how she got married so soon after breaking it off with him and she says ""It just happened"" As much as that made me want to jump through the screen and strangle her, its true....things in life happen you just can't explain. Love works in mysterious ways and this movie is proof. You feel for Tom having to watch the woman he loves fall for someone else so easily, and you feel for Tom trying to rebuild his life. The acting is brilliant, the storyline is brilliant...if not sad and wall-punch inducing. The only downside is that...well there really isn't any because this movie is not claiming to be an action or a thriller.<br/><br/>The one and only downside to this movie which prevented it from being 10 out of 10 is when Tom gets into a fight with a jerk at the bar and Summer blames him for it....he's defending your honor sweetie, why be mad at him? I say the highlight is after Summer first breaks up with Tom, he's on a date with another girl and he describes their breakup. ""She took a giant s*it on my face, literally"" Her ""Literally?"" Tom catches himself and says ""No...not literally, that's disgusting!"" All in all its a life lesson to be learned by everyone, things just happen. 8 out of 10"

No, this is realistic. It's just like life is. Not every person you meet who shares your interests is your soul mate. Not even if you feel like it is. Not everyone is going to have a happily-ever-after love story. This is life. And I also liked it because it's not about how girls cry over bad-boys, like in all other movies.

Currently, I am only awarding it 4/5 stars, however, I think this will be one that will grow on me. It's only been a short while since I've seen it, and I can't get it out of my mind.<br/><br/>That being said, it did fell forced at times, the side characters were only mildly amusing (his friends were good – not great, but his sister was so clichéd that she was almost hard to watch) and you can tell the movie it was trying to mimic in the opening with the outlined city (and then throughout.) Okay, if you couldn't tell, watch/re-watch the brilliant Juno.<br/><br/>In addition, I really want to say Gordon-Levitt did a great job and should be up for an Oscar nom. But, I can barely say he did a good job. He was trying to play a stuck-in-his-past (well, at all times) geek and though he got that down, no real depth or believability came from him. The movie really belonged solely to Deschanel.<br/><br/>She was perfect on many levels. Stole every scene, showed growth and depth consistently and had a perfect on screen persona, a genuine charisma that grabbed you as you got to know her. She deserves, at very least, an Oscar nomination for her real-life character.<br/><br/>Probably the majority of people go through relationships like Tom and Summer have. It's no spoiler that this relationship was doomed from day one (of 500 – obviously.) They tell you that less than a minute in. You want it to work out, you yearn for the nerd to get the free-bird (again, literally) girl. However, as previously mentioned, it was not meant to be and one of the most brilliant aspects was the revolution in the closing on why not.<br/><br/>I know I've been through a relationship like this. One party believes in fate, that one special, soul-mate (that's me, duh) while the other's skeptical and may not be the true ""one."" It does hurt that both me and Tom share more than the years in an office job trait – we're both nerds stuck in the past.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, back to the movie. We follow their relationship for 500 day, back and forth from day 42 to 303, then to 121. A lot of the comedy stems from these wonderful transitions. Such as, the fantastic dance segment to Tom's mood in another day of 500. (Side note: Spider-Man 3 did pretty much the same thing, following Peter Parker and in his mind a lovely stroll through the city and a vintage song playing. How did a movie that probably spent $500 million less get this kind of scene right?) Like I said before, some of this felt forced, including a Jerry Macguire blow up, but there were a lot of wonderful scenes, a lot of comedy that made me laugh out loud. It is an adult comedy, and even though most of the movie is pretty much ""clear"" (and ""clean"") of today's adult romcoms – i.e. any Paul Rudd/Seth Rogen/Adam Sandler features, it will remind you, you're not watching a PG-13 film.<br/><br/>I definitely would recommend this small movie to mass audiences, if not just for Deschanel. It was refreshing to see an original spin on the romantic movies of current years. A movie that puts a lot of 1970-80s references to people my age (or Tom's and Summer's) without shoving it down our throats."

","There are quite a few movies out there, that try to convince you that they are not your typical romantic movie/comedy, as this movie also states at the beginning. But in this case, you can really be sure that it is different. More related to the movie ""Swingers"", although quite a bit lighter, this really works great.<br/><br/>Apart from the fact, that you have a twist right from the start of the movie (which you may know, either if you have watched the trailer or read other reviews, but I'm not gonna spoil that), this also has a very crazy story-/time-line going for it. Having really great leads helps too. While I think the time-line jumps are a good thing, some might be confused by them and might not like them at all. you've been warned!"

","Few love stories do make sense!!!<br/><br/>Movie says there are no miracles and there is no such thing as fate and that's where I guess lies the utter fact that all the events are a Co- Incidence. The whole movie is pretty slow and seems to wind up no where. But I have to say that Marc Webb has got as much as he can out of the characters especially Rachel Hansen (Chloe Moretz) whose such a small character but surely does a lot of potential in the movie. Summin it up I can say that this is a love story which they deny it but the major difference is there is no Crap in it like the other Romantic saga storm which most of the time doesn't seem to make any sense...at the end the splitted couple meet up miraculously which is nearly impossible in our little Universe. Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) seems a a guy next door in the movie but has done a lot of justice to the role and seems almost perfect for it Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) is also fine throughout. Well the movie is a must watch the climax cannot be better resembles a lot of real life facts. Shows that what happens when u mix up reality and dreamland."
"CountZero313","7","0","2","22 November 2009"," relationships comedy subverts the genre
","It would be misleading to call 500 a rom-com. At the very outset we are told, ""This is not a love story."" And so it proves to be, after a fashion, though it is not giving too much away to say boy gets girl, and girl gets boy.<br/><br/>Tom is wannabee architect who has strayed from the path and needs to find his way back. Summer is a girl who does not believe in romantic love. Both will prove to be the essential catalyst for the other.<br/><br/>So far so generic, but flashing in an ostensibly random fashion between the 500 days of Tom and Summer's relationship, the film achieves an episodic feel, while at the same time chronologically following the seduction, love gained, love lost, closure achieved pattern of so many other relationship movies. The jump-cutting between days also allows for some fun moments, most notably when Tom enters an elevator on top of the world and exits bitter and jaded. Kudos to Joseph Gordon-Levitt for the range of expressions he employs to pull this off. Zooey Deschanel stays mainly deadpan as Summer and it works, as the woman's thoughts and behaviour keep you slightly off-kilter.<br/><br/>I smiled more than a few times. The song-and-dance sequence is ripped from Enchanted, and Bill Forsyth invented the older brother taking relationship advice from his primary-age sister in Gregory's Girl, but in a well-worn, tired genre, 500 manages to be fresh without appearing too contrived."

The director perfectly depicts the various emotions Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)goes through and to Tom's credit he displays even the subtle ones to near perfection.<br/><br/>The cinematographic style is quite fresh and interesting, and for those who love Quentin Tarantino , also showed in a non-linear fashion.

","I have to confess that if there's one genre of films that I particularly enjoy, it's off beat comedies. I love films that are unstructured where the characterisations take priority over the story. I'm pleased to say that (500) days of summer is one of those films and it's very enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the relationship between Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel) over 500 days. The film isn't sequenced however and jumps around over the 500 days. This makes for an interesting effect as one moment they're getting to know each other and the next they hate the sight of each other. The two leads play nice roles and the two characters are opposite from the conventional male/female stereotypes in terms of their romance. If you are like me and love off beat films check this out."
"trymog","9","0","1","9 November 2009"," Beautyfully composed
","The intro of the movie really makes you visualize the characters, Tom and Summer. Tom, the sad boy who just can't find happiness - which for him is the one girl. The melancholic and unstable mood of Tom Hansen makes your mind feel sorry for him, and you can recognize yourself in his situation. He finds himself in a situation where nothing is important in his life, he is making greeting cards for living, but in a way he can't express his own feelings. A normal day at work, Tom Hansen is feeling love at first sight. Summer. The girl he has been dreaming of. Tom really seems to be sorting things out with Summer, and never has life itself gone that way for Tom Hansen.<br/><br/>One of the things i love most with this movie is the composition. It goes back and forth in days, and you can see from day four in their relationship, and the next day could be sixty five. The musical choices are delightful and really matches with the feelings you sit with in the movie. This is no regularly romantic comedy, and maybe not so entertaining. But you sit with an impression after you've seen it, and thats why i've chosen to give it 9 out of 10 stars."

Something was off, yet I don't know what. Maybe the feelings were slightly altered so that they fit into more of a comedic atmosphere, or maybe it was his face, or maybe it's just that it was actually a completely different story than mine.<br/><br/>Bottom line: it's funny, it's real, the wife loved it and I found it nice enough to watch and thoroughly enjoy.

It is nice to see someone making a movie about just how unpredictable a relationship can be-and the one the male lead gets into in this movie is really something. Good acting keeps the pace moving along well and the cinematography is just off beat enough to keep the whole thing from being bogged down in visual clichés. Probably good for many different fans of cinema, from artsy types to more conventional thinkers. It is refreshing all in all and I recommend it.

"Interrogangbang","8","0","2","4 November 2009"," Forget you ever saw Maid in Manhattan.
","This, my friend, is not your typical romantic comedy. As a matter of fact, there's nothing typical or cliché about this movie at all (apart from maybe the main character's dimwit friends). The tag line, ""Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."", really sums it up. And it's not only the plot that is unusual for this genre, everything from the witty dialog to the pleasing visual effects is outstanding. Not to mention Joseph Gordon-Levitt - seriously, where has this kid been since 3rd rock from the sun went off air? Glad to see you back, Joe.<br/><br/>Tom Hansen (Gordon-Levitt) is working a dead-end job at a greeting card company, biding time while waiting to find the love of his life and live happily ever after. When he meets quirky Summer (Deschanel), he thinks he's found what he's been looking for. And sure, at first things are rosy. Unfortunately for Tom, Summer soon grows tired of the relationship and moves on. Tom doesn't. Plenty of post-breakup hilarity ensues, and whilst feeling for our main boy you also find yourself laughing your pants off. A Valentine's day card reading ""Roses are red, violets are blue - F*** you, w****"" would've come in handy at some point to the best of us, right? The relatively unknown Marc Webb and the brilliant cast manage to create realistic yet highly likable characters, which is so rare to see in a romantic comedy (I'm looking at you, Matthew McCounaghey). The film also has a very natural flow to it, which isn't a given considering the constant leaps in time and oddities like an awesome dancing scene, not to mention the short tributes to old cinema classics. The best part, however, is that despite (or perhaps thanks to) the lack of a fairytale ending, (500) Days of Summer is definitely a feel-good movie. It's really all about moving on, no matter how horrible the heartbreak.<br/><br/>So do yourself a favor and drop your prejudices towards the ""romantic comedy""-label. This is a through-out entertaining and enjoyable movie with very few flaws, plus an introduction to what's possibly the funnest game since Twister (you'll see). Against all my expectations I left the theater smiling, so I'm giving it 8/10. Don't miss out."
"estebanako","9","0","1","28 October 2009"," Why doesn't he get it? Sad but true for most guys
","So much has been written about the guy who finally gets to date the girl of his dreams, it is like Notting Hill, where the star-struck bookshop owner gets to date and end up with the movie star. But there is quite a parallel here, if the girl sees her ends are not met and she is threatened in any way, she will JUST LEAVE the guy without any heart at all. Girls who are in a position to know her heart is more important, or her position is more valuable than the poor guy who is madly in love with her. Like Summer, she knows her heart, and her expectations are broken and is prepared to leave Tom. Meanwhile, guys who are so blinded, yes, who literally look through distorted love struck glasses, have known small signs of being brushed off but..CONSCIOUSLY ignore it, and think, ""things will be all right, we are together and I wanna enjoy all I can out of this ride"". That is why Tom's heart gets terribly smashed and gets so dark and depressed. Still my logical mind argues, why does Tom still spend time having coffee and have a great time on that train with Summer? And why doesn't he just leave her, and stalk off? Maybe it's because, in a man's psychology, being hopeless in love is just that, you get so paralyzed and you just enjoy being in that coma, until the plug gets pulled out, and you wake up from that dream into a nightmare of reality that she is LEAVING you.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie does all the reality and the angst thing right. Kudos to all the actors and the director! <br/><br/>Yes, in this telenovela and romantic comedy crazy part of Southeast Asia, people are flocking to watch this movie and come out shell-shocked and surprisingly delighted and sad at the same time."
"skymount37","9","0","1","15 October 2009"," A film about a boy meets & falls in love with a girl .... NOT a love story ....
","There are lots of stuff i like about this movie. The A-list hipster main cast Joseph-Gordon Levitt (as Tom) and Zooey Deschanel (as Summer) simply put in praiseworthy performances. The plot is non-linear, director Marc Webb does not rush the inevitable, he shuffles between scenes of courtship and heart-break. The lurches in time of the film keep us well and truly off balance. I also like the fantasy sequence after the two finally consummate their love, as Tom dances with a bunch of strangers in the park.I am appealed to the split screen about expectation and reality when Tom was invited to Summer's 'farewell' party. The film actually poses me with lots of questions about love & life .... both are mysterious in many ways. Do you believe in divine intervention, cosmic coincidences or both? Do love exist securely within marriage? How about romantic love before, during & after marriage? Is it possible to love someone(romantically) apart from your spouse? Do you believe that there's one & only someone somewhere out there for both of you to meet each other to make each other truthfully happy? Care to watch it for yourself & reflect on these questions? Presently, for me at least, i choose to believe that love is to want others to be genuinely happy even though we may not eventually end up together; the process is more important than the outcomes.My heart is broken during the scene when Tom spoke up during his last meeting before he resigned from his greeting-cards designer & writer job. A good film is one which makes you smile, giggle, laugh, tear or even cry unexpectedly within the continuous screening time of the whole film. This is one for me. What makes me smile at the end of the film is when Tom dated a girl named Autumn. Watch it."
"Monotreme02","7","0","1","15 October 2009"," A film that stays with you; charming, funny and beautiful
","First and foremost it should be mentioned that the film is extremely well-made, despite its crew being composed mostly of first-timers. Marc Webb, the first-time director, has years of music video and commercial experience behind him, which explains how well-made and good looking the film is. But the fact that he managed to craft such a taught and fluid feature-length film is nonetheless quite impressive and almost surprising. In any case, I expect great things from him in the future. Fact is, this is an entirely indie film but without an indie feel; it's very well shot and professionally made, and I think that just adds to its genuineness. The film also features many elements that distinguish it from just an average film telling the same story: split-screen, frequent breaking of the fourth wall, a spontaneous song-and-dance number, animation, and of course the non-linear storytelling (with a number on screen indicating the position of the scene portrayed out of the titular 500 days to boot) are just a few of said elements that lend this film much of its uniqueness.<br/><br/>But ultimately, what makes this movie as special as it is are its characters. I have always said that a film begins and ends with its characters, and as far as I'm concerned, a good, plot-less character study will always be more interesting than a great story with uninteresting characters. And in a film like this, which eventually tells a pretty simple, straightforward and mundane story that we've all seen and heard before, the characters are key to distinguish it, to make it stand out. And this film succeeds more than most others in defining and presenting real, grounded, three-dimensional and identifiable characters. First-time screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber do a fantastic job at defining these characters, but the credit lies with the actors for embodying them and breathing the life into them that radiates from the screen. I have been a long-time fan of both of the leads, especially of Joseph Gordon-Levitt who over the years, be it in Mysterious Skin or in Brick, has carved himself a niche as one of the most interesting and consistent young actors of his generation. Zooey Deschanel has always been wonderful, from her small supporting roles in older films such as Almost Famous to her more recent status as a leading lady, but this is the first movie of hers I've seen that really gives her a chance to shine and portray a fascinating and full-fledged character. Both performers really stand out in the film, and the supporting cast does a great job as well.<br/><br/>With films like this, it is easy to appreciate the technical accomplishments, from the spot-on cinematography to the fantastic performances. But a true, emotional connection with the audience is something rare, and very personal. This film connected with me. I just felt a very strong affinity to its characters, and to the situations it put them in. What I love about movies of its type is that it portrays circumstances that are all-too-familiar, drawn from real life, and totally identifiable if one goes through similar experiences in one's own life. I think that anyone who has had experience with sour relationships or with unrequited love can identify very easily with this film and its characters. Or perhaps some people will identify with Summer; people who have found themselves in relationships, basically, in which their feelings weren't as strong as their partner's. Some moments in this film are right out of life – the moment shared by Summer and Tom outside the bar, when she's just standing there waiting for him to kiss her but he hesitates and they end up parting ways. And the film flawlessly portrays the characters' feelings as they go through these motions and find themselves in these true-to-life situations.<br/><br/>This is an indie film, but it doesn't feel like one. It's whimsical, but never precious. It's stylized but never unrealistic. It's very small-scale but it never feels cheap. Eventually, what makes it work so well as a film is the fact that it takes a very simple story and situation, drawn from real life, and portrays it in a way that is cinematic enough to keep our interest, but realistic enough to resonate and stay true to life. It's a film that doesn't reach for the stars, doesn't feature a meaningful plot or story and doesn't convey some big message; rather, it's a film built on moments, beautiful and wonderful moments that make it so special: the narration, the song-and-dance number, Summer's glances at Tom and her reactions to his behavior, the dialogue, the two lead performances, the genuinely hilarious moments and jokes (I neglected to mention that the film is also really funny!) the music, the Belle and Sebastian and Smiths references, the non-linear chronology, the split-screen sequence showing Tom's ""expectations"" on one side and the ""reality"" as it actually unfolds on the other, the moments that just totally capture exactly what the real life situations they depict feel like, such as the aforementioned bar exterior, or the encounter on the train. It's one of those films that stays with you, that you want to go see again and again, to take that journey with the characters one more time, to get to know them even more, and to look into their lives and see so much of your own."
"alexa_4912","8","0","2","15 October 2009"," Refreshingly different but hit and miss
","I liked this film a lot. The premise of boy meets girl, boy loves girl but girl doesn't love boy appealed to me. <br/><br/>There were several things about the film I liked. I'm not a huge fan of Zooey Deschanel, but her quirky and slightly sad portrayal of the commitment phobic, cynical Summer was great. This was a great contrast to the usual heroine in a romantic comedy, beautiful but a bit desperate for love and ending up in a huge stereotype of a relationship. Its refreshing for someone who is also sceptical of romance and true love (despite being in a good long term relationship), some people just aren't romantic like that, and don't feel a need to ""put a label on the relationship"". However, the end of the film drastically let me down. From having her own unique and slightly sad/cynical view on love, suddenly she makes a complete u-turn and gets married without any explanation. What is this for? Are we supposed to take away the exact opposite message to the one we have been given all the way through, that true love does exist and life really is a big stereotype? <br/><br/>That said, there are many clever techniques at work, split scene cameras which are pretty effective, some animated or black and white scenes etc. I wasn't impressed by the jumping back and forward in time, but I can see where they are coming from with creating an overall picture. Also, the soundtrack (a lot of Regina Spektor, who at her best is melancholy perfection) is very good. Alternative and effective at creating the right mood. <br/><br/>There are some cheesy aspects: the character ""Autumn"" who he meets at the end, being symbolism at its most intelligence insulting. I hate the u-turn in Summer's character/beliefs and I think the ending could have been a lot better/different. That said it has its own kind of beauty and is a good change from the usual Hollywood romantic fodder."
"paudie","8","0","2","6 October 2009"," Excellent RomCom from the Male Point of View
","I really enjoyed this film. It is funny, touching, well written and very well acted. It thankfully avoids most of the romcom clichés that we are so familiar.<br/><br/>The film tells of the 500 days from the first time Tom meets (and instantly falls for) Summer. In this case Tom is the hopeless romantic and Summer goes with the flow but doesn't believe in love. There is a twist by not showing the events in chronological order. So at the start of each scene we see which day of the 500 it is and therefore have a good idea of the stage the relationship is at. So we go back and forth between the good times of the early days to Tom's problems in dealing with the break up and Summer moving on.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt play the lead characters perfectly. You like them despite their faults and hope things work out well. However it becomes obvious that their relationship is not meant to be but hope they don't get too badly hurt. The supporting cast is always important in comedies and they are also great, especially Geoffrey Arend as one of Tom's workmates.<br/><br/>A romcom that both men and women will enjoy. And hopefully some women will realise that some of us men are romantic too!"

","Yes, here it is. Here it is that indie film that since 2006, when Little Miss Sunshine stole our hearts, we have become accustomed to watch: (500) Days of Summer (Marc Webb, 2009).<br/><br/>Everything is there. The not-so-famous-but-yet-known actors, the cool music, the mix with art/drawings, the witty dialogs...<br/><br/>If that wasn't enough (and it usually isn't), (500) Days of Summer speaks volumes to me. The story is bitter-sweet and romantic, it has a cool soundtrack and better yet there is so much in the script that reminds me of Nick Hornby's books - who happens to be my favourite contemporary English write.<br/><br/>But still I can't help but feel that something is missing from (500) Days. That something just doesn't quite measure up to its predecessors.<br/><br/>I know it really isn't a fair competition. When you look back, after Little Miss Sunshine three year ago, we were greeted by Diablo Cody's Oscar winning Juno in 2007 and last year we saw the sweet-teenage-flick Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist.<br/><br/>So I guess we were a little spoiled, because these three films were actually really good in their own right. They all had something that you could go ""wow, this is actually pretty great"".<br/><br/>However, in our 2009 lovely indie film there isn't anything like that. More than that, (500) felt a bit too fake. Everything is so well put together. The dialogues, the costumes, the makeup, the sets everything! It really does feel like is fitting some kind of genre box, following a formula, which is not exactly a bad thing, but I think it ends up being pretty boring.<br/><br/>Funny enough, in the end none of its shortcomings matters.

"DICK STEEL","10","0","1","6 October 2009"," A Nutshell Review: (500) Days of Summer
","(500) Days of Summer chronicles the entire love-found, love-experienced, and love-lost of Gordon-Levitt's Hansen, brought up to believe in the notion of The One, where he's patiently waiting for that girl to appear, someone whom he knows he'll be able to spend the rest of his life with. Enter Deschanel's Summer, who's everything he envisioned and he thought the puzzle was complete, only that Summer has, through her experiences, decided in a manner very upfront about any potential relationship with Tom, or others for that matter. Personal Life Fact Check One: I was told, warned even, that it's gonna be casual, with no pressure and we take it as it goes.<br/><br/>But hey, when the girl sends all the right signals, you move headlong with it, don't you? And inevitably it was the time of their lives, where romance and spontaneity were the order of the day. No label or ""regonition"" is going to jinx what has been strongly established and what the hearts truly felt, and basically the lovers bask in each other's presence. The scene at Ikea was insane, in a touching way. Personal Life Fact Check Two: Ditto on the labels, and as far as I recall, it didn't bother me in any way. Little did I know of course.<br/><br/>Then the inexplicable separation. It just happened. Without much warning, though what Summer did, was like a flashback to my personal past. The disinterest, the disengagement, zoning out. On hindsight we always tend to look back, to search for clues on the first signs of breakage, only to find none because we may be too blinded. Nobody's perfect, though I always think one of the most cruel things to say aloud, is to tell you'll always remain as friends. Innately you know you always will, but deep down always regretting that somehow, somewhere, something screwed up. Then the brushing of the hand away from yours, then disappearance. Personal LIfe Fact Check Three: All the above.<br/><br/>But of course with separation brings about the rather idealistic goal of trying to win someone back, which is more or less what Tom attempted, to detriment results. They meet on a train, and decided on a whim to go for a coffee session where they spend some incredible moments post-breakup. Personal Life Fact Check Four: We met on a train platform, though her walking into the train and me heading out of, didn't offer an opportunity to chat. But look her up I did, and we spent some time chatting over tea at the airport one very early morning.<br/><br/>There were enough poignant moments thereafter in the last arc of the film to make me go through those turbulent emotions buried deep in my memory all over again, which culminated in what would be one of the saddest, yet happy moments on a park bench. Sad because for someone who didn't believe in love, she sure got that wedding band fast (for someone who told me she didn't believe in it), and also the words that came out of Summer's mouth was on one hand true, yet very piercing to the heart. Happy, because it was one of the final moments you know that you needed for closure, that someone had already obviously moved on, and one should too. Personal Fact Check Five: Well we didn't meet on a park bench, but we met at a mutual friend's wedding dinner. The engagement ring was there so it was self-explanatory. She looked happy, and I'll only congratulate her if I mean it. She got married last month.<br/><br/>So that was (500) Days with one of the most incredible persons I've ever shared plenty of experiences with, good or bad. Like one of the characters advised, each time we look back we see all the good stuff, and neglecting the bad ones, which is often why we feel so miserable. The story do take the opportunity to preach what all friends would tell you when you've broken up, either about the other trees in the forest, or the other fishes in the sea... but in any case, it'll never, ever be the same again.<br/><br/>If you've made it this far, then allow me to go back to the movie, and I have to admit it was rather therapeutic writing about the above, with the film providing that excuse just to do so. Be warned though the narrative is told in non-linear format, though the animated inter- titles do show at which stage of Tom and Summer's relationship we're observing, together with the postcard perfect landscape where the hues and tones give you that clue of the season, as well as the analogy of the mood as experienced by Tom.<br/><br/>Given that the characters have fantastic taste in music, and spend some time in the theatres, there are just enough pop cultural references (love The Graduate), as well as a slew of well- chosen songs which brought out emotions to a higher level. Not only that, the part which wowed me the most, and kudos to director Marc Webb, is the split screen treatment of Expectation and Reality, a gimmick so wonderfully used, that the scene just begs for another viewing of the film.<br/><br/>Both Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel did wonders with their roles, and while I can identify with the roller coaster emotions felt by Tom through the former's acting, it was more painful watching Zooey Deschanel's Summer performance, because of the kooky way things happened, and the nonchalance shown which was so, so similar to what I had experienced, as if watching it happen all over again, right in front of my eyes, making me want to scream out to Tom and say ""that's the sign, man, time to bail or be prepared to get your heart shattered"".<br/><br/>I like this movie too much, and am going to propel it firmly to the one of my favourites this year."

","Following their lead roles in lesser known films All The Real Girls, Manic, and Sweet Jane, Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt have, together as actors, again shown their ability to grapple with the emotions of complex love and human interaction. The film makes beautiful use of sunlight and shadow to emphasize tone; a fresh Alt-Indie soundtrack; and camera angles that really compliment the intimate emotional interaction of the characters. A number of inventive scene compositions bring us neatly into the minds of our leads. Teasing questions are successfully introduced about relationship attachment, and the constructs of our modern thinking and place in the world. While undoubtedly a sweet film, it's rare to see such an intelligent approach to romance viewed predominantly from a male perspective."

"NadalsLeftBicep","8","0","2","24 September 2009"," Genius in it's own little way
","This film is genius in a way I've never seen a film be before, and it's in the reality and relatability of it. Firstly, the relationship portrayed is so 'everyday'. There is no ""Romeo and Juliet""-esquire complete love, or ""Heartbreak Kid"" style dysfunctionality, it is plain normal, and embraces that wholeheartedly. The audience is gifted to two brilliant performances that show how in the beginning of any relationship there is that unmatched fire that blinkers all other feelings and makes everything seem perfect. I applaud both the writers and the two leads for catching this unlike anything I've seen before.<br/><br/>Secondly, and more importantly I feel, the real genius is that I came out of the theatre feeling like the film quite easily could have been written about me. And I could tell 90% of the audience had the same feeling. There's no over-dramatisation of events, just those 'blinkers' being removed slowly throughout the film. The line ending ""...I suggest you look again"" is one of the most poignant I've ever heard in this genre. You don't have to have felt real pain or loss in love to understand Tom's (lead male) position; if you've ever been sent mixed messages, messed around a bit, or cannot see how to save your relationship, you connect with him. You can also relate to Summer if you have experience of a relationship where the counterpart is more keen than you. You don't know exactly how to express it, and even when you try to make yourself clear, you end up sending mixed messages and hurting the person anyway.<br/><br/>And it's not gender specific, another beauty of the film.Of course, we know from the tag-lines that the usual masculine and feminine roles are swapped, but they're easily interchangeable and anyone in the audience could relate to either side.<br/><br/>I struggle to find any other words to explain the genius in this film. I just assure you that if 100 people are in a theatre watching this, 90 of them will relate to it very strongly, and will be touched by this film. If you don't, there's a high chance you have found the 'one' with far too much ease, and so you can laugh at the rest of us anyway. <br/><br/>This film has so many messages, I'm quite certain I didn't catch them all, and so know I will enjoy watching it time and time again in the future and being able to relate in a different way each time. See it."

","What's so great about 500 Days Of Summer is that unlikely most romantic comedies it depicts real life, where not everything goes according to plan,where bad things do happen and people do suffer. The premise is quite simple: Summer Finn,played by Zooey Deschanel, doesn't believe in true love, and Tom Hansen,played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who does believe,falls for her.Obviously this can't go well. Despite the constant warnings by Summer that she isn't looking for anything serious and does not want a commitment, Tom falls deeper in love with her everyday and as the time goes by the two of them become lovers.However, when asked about it,Summer refuses to put a label on their relationship which leaves Tom with a feeling of unease.One day Summer leaves and Tom is left wondering,how the hell can he move on? The story is presented in a non-chronological format which is the first thing that really makes the film stand out, the way it was edited was absolutely brilliant.Zooey Deschanel gave a solid performance but was definitely out shined by Joseph Gordon-Levitt,who for me is an amazing actor yet very underrated.He's not your typical Hollywood heartthrob leading man but there's something very unique and special about him.The film also has a killer soundtrack, and I really mean it,the songs are beautiful and fit the scenes(and the general ambiance)perfectly! One of the few things I didn't like so much was the ending,I don't want to spoil it but it is kind of an happy ending that doesn't feel consistent with the rest of the movie.It doesn't feel very honest.With a different ending this movie could have been almost perfect.Regardless, 500 Days Of Summer is an refreshing movie with two good performances(mainly Joseph Gorden-Levitt) that shows the sweet and sour aspects of romance and deserves to be seen.<br/><br/>8/10"

","From a rather unremarkable cast, to a rather unremarkable set of trailers. At first glance, it seems like director Marc Webb went into the 500 Days of Summer project rather half-heartedly and without fully understanding just how to market a big summer rom-com.<br/><br/>However, woe-betide you if from these rather uninspiring first impressions, you decide not to see it. You may just be missing one of the finest moments of cinema this year.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel (The Happening) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Halloween H20) star in this wonderful and uplifting tale of a man's journey through the pleasure and of course pains of love and dating.<br/><br/>The artistic flair in Webb's direction may, at first be confusing to some, but settle in with popcorn and a cold drink and it soon becomes apparent just how the film is made; making it an unconventional but thoroughly enjoyable portrait of love.<br/><br/>The acting from the leads can only be described as lovely, in the blue corner, we have Gordon Levitt's character Tom Hansen; working in a greetings card factory, he dreams of being an architect, though those dreams seem to have outreached his grasp. He practically leaps off the screen in a soft, gooey manner, showing perhaps that men aren't as heartless as they are sometimes seen. In the red corner we have Deschanel playing Summer. Her cutesy looks and charming persona make the two actors have a wonderful chemistry, matched by only a few in the past decade.<br/><br/>Webb has done exceptionally well turning what could've been a formulaic love story into something interesting, original. It really is a mesmerising 95 minutes. All in all; it is practically faultless."

","Lapsed architect Tom writes slogans for greetings cards. He finds himself unexpectedly smitten by new clerical assistant Summer, and it seems she likes him too, although she does deliver a warning to him that she's not looking for anything permanent.<br/><br/>And therein lies a factor which is instrumental in raising this romcom a cut above the norm. Yes, it's romantic and yes, it is often funny, but underlying this is the knowledge, right from the start, that Summer is The One as far as Tom is concerned, yet not only is this not reciprocated, but the relationship is doomed to failure.<br/><br/>The script is not especially laugh-out-loud funny, but it is constantly amusing. More importantly, it is sharp, the characters are well rounded and believable, and the thorny issues raised by a relationship breaking down (and worse) are addressed and not avoided.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt is a likable and vulnerable Tom, and Zooey Deschanel makes amends for her appalling performance in The Happening by giving us an attractive and free-thinking Summer.<br/><br/>For one appalling minute I thought the movie was going to give us the conventional Hollywood happy ending, which would have betrayed the integrity of the characters and the movie. Happily, that didn't happen. Then I thought we were going to get the ""second best"" substitute happy ending. And I suppose we did, but with such a satisfactory payoff that I didn't care.<br/><br/>There is a fabulous song and dance sequence about half way through which deserves mention - broad smile time! And, most of all, this film is beautifully and carefully constructed - it has been assembled with real care.<br/><br/>Highly recommended,"

","Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) once dreamed of being an architect but he now works for a greeting card company in the City of Angels. He is also a firm believer in romance and soulmates. One day, his boss hires a new personal assistant, Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and Tom is smitten from his very first glimpse at the dark-haired secretary. His friends and co-workers see his admiration almost immediately and tease him relentlessly but, fairly soon, Summer becomes friends with Tom. However, she makes it clear early on that she is only looking for a casual relationship, nothing serious. Nevertheless, Tom pursues a romance with the lovely Summer, for he believes he can convince her that they are meant to be a forever couple. They go shopping at Ikea together, hike up to their favorite lookout over the city, and see each other often. Tom thinks he has opened a floodgate when Summer actually has him over to her place. But, in a relationship where the level of attachment is so lopsided, can anything good result? This is a comical, sure-fire look at the heartache of unrequited love, one of the best ever. Tom is the epitome of all-consuming love generated toward someone who does not match his affections, not by far. But, its difficult to place blame on someone who makes his or her position known from the start. As the unlikely couple, Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are terrific and all of the lesser cast members are great as well. In addition, the film is inventive and clever, even mixing a bit of animation into the fabric of the movie. What a surprise and a delight this is! The costumes, scenes, script and production values are also very worthy and the direction is surefooted and smooth, a difficult feat when the timeline jumps from past to present and other places in-between at every turn. It only takes one day to acclaim this flick as a top film of 2009 and it would make a wonderful, cathartic view for anyone who has had their heart pulverized, even if its only been a matter of weeks, for the movie also offers seeds of romantic hope for the scorned. Therefore, don't wait 500 days for a watch but make plans for a showing now."
"courtahneyyy","7","0","2","3 September 2009"," Deschanel shows a new side, while Gordon-Levitt appears pathetic
","Being confined to a small town since the early days of my childhood, I found it easy to be drawn to things of the big city. Of the many attractions in Dallas, the Angelika Film Center is quite possibly my favorite. So, after previewing the trailer for Marc Webb's (500) Days of Summer, with my innate love for Zooey Deschanel and finding out the movie was playing at the Angelika one summer night, two friends and I sped off to the DFW on a hot July night, only to be slightly disappointed in our viewing.<br/><br/>The plot of (500) Days, even the title itself, is quite deceiving, claiming that it ""is not a love story."" Quite contrarily, (500) Days seems to be an extremely lavish romantic comedy. Though the film has a unique approach to love, it is not for those fateful believers in the idea of romance. <br/><br/>The coupled duo, Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, meet ever so fatefully at their card company job, and develop a typical office relationship. Deschanel warns him early she does not want a relationship, while Gordon-Levitt simultaneously falls head over heels for her. The film has many cute relationship activities, such as a karaoke bar scene. However, the script lacks in cathartic appeal, dismissing lovers' everyday conversations.<br/><br/>While I felt sorry and sympathized with Gordon-Levitt, I also felt empathy for Deschanel's cold-hearted character. The film makes clear that she intends not to hurt him from the beginning, with a warning, and that he traps himself inside a wormhole of emotion. Gordon- Levitt appears pathetic to the audience, doing anything he can to win Deschanel back, while she becomes involved elsewhere.<br/><br/>(500) Days proves that love is not always the answer, and that, while being a fictitious story, two people cannot share the exact sentiment toward each other at the same time. The movie highlights only one situation of love, boy falling for an unattainable goal, and describes the way that no one ever falls the exact same way for anyone else. The closing of (500) Days, though not as completely expected, is the giveaway to the film's trailer claim of its absence of being a typical romantic comedy.<br/><br/>The psychological concept that relationships are cyclical deters the overall theme of (500) Days. The meaning of the story is a little hazy, but it has good intentions for ""not being a love story."" The script seems to lack a certain quality of real life, without sentiment, and has an extremely jumpy storyline between reality and the imaginative. I applaud only Deschanel's acting in the film because of its opposition to her normal character: mostly a kindhearted and naive sweetheart.<br/><br/>The visual aspects of the film, with bright colors and sunshine in abundance, and the music added to the quality of (500) Days. One scene, depicting Gordon-Levitt's happy-go-lucky attitude after a night with Deschanel, uses blue and turquoise colorful undertones and Hall and Oates ""You Make My Dreams Come True"" to express his innate happiness. I bought the soundtrack on iTunes immediately after returning home.<br/><br/>Fans of How to Deal, Love, Actually, and P.S. I Love You will appreciate (500) Days for its one-of-a-kind approach at relationships in their making. However, I would not recommend the film to anyone who has any question whatsoever in their relationship, or for those who see fate as a number one option to finding a person to spend the rest of their life with. After all, nothing lasts forever."
"iKramerica-1","8","0","2","31 August 2009"," The non-Maxim Male's POV of dating
","Contrary to what popular culture would have you believe, there are many men who believe just as the main character in this movie believes: that there is someone out there for them worth loving and settling down with. This story is told from that perspective. <br/><br/>First, the acting and film-making are both fresh. Obviously the two stars are ""who they are"" and act accordingly, but they were the right choice for the roles. Zoey D is always quirky but adorable and hard to ignore, and JG-L is his normal teddy bear likable, and that's good here. Because there is never a time in the film when you are supposed to hate these people, and these two are unhatable, so it works.<br/><br/>The style of the film is novel. It's linear in how it presents what you should know at the time, but non-linear in the time-line, showing outcome before setup, or various stages of a relationship in quick succession, using a day counter as a motif over a sketch of changing seasons/weather as a symbolic representation of the mood. Really clever, but not gimmicky in it's cleverness. An entirely different way of playing with time than in Momento, for example, but just as effective.<br/><br/>This isn't a movie where the male lead is a playboy and all his friends sit around degrading women all day. Nor is the male lead a loser simply because he's not a woman's man. Nor does he ""get drunk and cheat"" or any other cliché.<br/><br/>Because that ISN'T how all men are (player or loser or one drink away from infidelity), and this movie acknowledges that and celebrates it. In fact, nobody in the movie is like that. They are just real people. When happy, they are happy. When mad, they may call someone a nasty name, but they don't mean it. When sad, they are sad. It's what real people do.<br/><br/>And that's what's so good about this movie. Even though the situation isn't as deep as real life might be, it still resonated with the audience, especially the men, who were laughing at all the endearing parts and the true parts, because we've all been there, where the girl we love just doesn't love us back, but we are too blind to realize it and go through life in a happy daze until we crash and burn. It was almost cathartic to realize how many men had been through that same situation, and hopefully the women in the audience took a look around and saw that men are caring, sensitive people inside, despite what Hollywood usually tells them.<br/><br/>Now if only today's filmmakers could learn to pace things a little better. The only reason this movie doesn't get a 10 is because there were 5-10 minutes throughout the film that were slow/redundant, and if the editing were tighter, the film would have been more powerful. It's not as drawn out as an Apatow movie like Funny People or Knocked Up, with entire sections of the movie that should be excised, but it still could have been tighter.<br/><br/>Maybe it deserves a 9, considering what gets 10's on IMDb, but I think 8 is pretty damn good."

Too many movies have flash backs that are hard to ""place,"" not this movie.

Towards the end, the expectations in the audience are high that they'll end up together, and the fact that they don't may disappoint some, but it adds to the reality of the film.<br/><br/>Tom's frustration over Summer is a feeling that many have felt throughout their lives when their hearts are crushed for reasons beyond them. The writing is smart, the plot is gripping, and Marc Webb's directing is fantastically original. (especially in the split screen ""expectation"" scene) This is one of those movies where you leave the theater and talk about it, then go bed, and think about it, then wake up, and think about it. It sticks with you for days, and will have you rethink the traditional romantic comedy style that has been so cliché in recent years."
"highspot","8","0","2","25 August 2009"," Accurate and heartfelt, falling in love with (500) Days of Summer is easy to do.
","Refreshingly honest and painfully accurate, (500) Days of Summer takes us on a journey that many of us know all too well, that of love gone wrong. As potentially depressing as this premise sounds, director Marc Webb manages to find a beautiful balance between the agonizing lows and giddy highs of love (and the lack thereof) to leave us feeling not depressed as if constantly regretting the one that got away, but satisfied that we managed to have some great times together and actually learned about life and ourselves in the process.<br/><br/>As the narrator says within the first few minutes of the movie, this is not a love story. Nor is it truly a comedy. At the same time though, it IS a story about love that is often funny, sometimes tragic and always heartfelt. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays Tom Hansen, a hopeless romantic who believes that true happiness comes with finding the one person in the whole world he is meant to spend his life with. When he meets the enigmatic Summer Finn, played by Zooey Deschanel, Tom soon feels that he has finally met his one true love. Is it fate that Tom and Summer are destined to be together or is fate just an idea manufactured by greeting card companies and the entertainment industry in order to cash in on our apparent need for a happy ending? For that matter is true love anything more than an illusion, a fleeting emotion that fades as quickly as it appears leaving us wondering if it was ever really there at all?<br/><br/>Summer certainly doesn't believe in love. Near the beginning of the film we are taken to a little over halfway through the 500 days that make up the time frame of the story and watch as Tom's heart is shattered as Summer reveals that she doesn't think the two should see each other any more and says those insidious words that have crushed the hopes of countless young men... ""You're still my best friend!""<br/><br/>The remainder of the movie unfolds as if we are in Tom's mind, jumping back and forth through the 500 days trying to piece together what went wrong and thinking of what can be done to make it right. The entirety of their relationship is seen through Tom's eyes and it really does feel like you're in someone's head as they're dealing with a freshly ended relationship. At first he remembers the good times, the day they met, their first date, their first kiss. All of this reminiscing only makes the reality of the situation worse as we can see the signals that he's either missed or ignored along the way, some subtle like a sideways glance or an awkward pause, others blatant like Summer telling him point blank early on that she's not looking for anything more than friendship. Is there any hope of reconnecting with Summer and creating a happy Hollywood ending?<br/><br/>Tom's dilemma is sure to strike a nerve with not only all of us hopelessly romantic guys out there, but anyone, male or female, who has ever been sure of what you want but wanted more than what someone was willing to give. On the flip side, many can probably also relate to Summer who's not sure of what she's looking for but might one day be surprised to find that what she wants wasn't what she thought it would be.<br/><br/>Both Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt give fantastically true and subtle performances. Just like any guy falling head over heels for a girl Tom blows certain actions (or inactions) out of proportion to often comedic effect, seeing missed opportunities where there might not be any and seeing deep meaning where there might just be coincidence. Levitt plays it so real though that when Tom is happy you feel his joy and when he's not you feel his anguish. Summer is mostly seen as a thing of mystery and Deschanel plays this perfectly, her reserved demeanor hiding most of what is going on in her head and heart. Instead we can best decipher her feelings through her actions like pulling her hand away from Tom's or her silence and changes in attitude. It's heartbreaking watching Tom try to recapture the feeling of the early days of the relationship knowing that he's on a sinking ship.<br/><br/>At the end of the 500 days everyone has learned from their experiences and has grown as a person... this includes the audience. At its best (500) Days of Summer is a cathartic release for anyone who is falling or has ever fallen in or out of love (or thought they had) and leaves you with a bittersweet hopefulness for the next time love sneaks up on you. At its worst this film is a quirky take on a timeless tale with enough genuine laughs and unique direction to make it enjoyable for all but the most jaded movie goer. Like the one that got away, I'll remember (500) Days of Summer fondly both for the joy it brought me in the good times and the things I learned in the bad."

My theatre friend thought it was just okay while my sister loved it while I mostly liked it. There's plenty of amusing scenes between the leads Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel not to mention many heartbreaking ones too. One of the most entertaining ones was the Hall and Oates ""You Make My Dreams"" number that Gordon-Levitt and others dance to with an animated bird that surprised me. Part of me thought Joseph's conversations with that little girl was a bit pretentious. Still, the back and forth of many sequences and the way things end up is enough for me to recommend (500) Days of Summer. P.S.

","This is a good movie, but the problem is that this movie is way too personal. If you have gone through the things in the movie and know people like Tom and Summer it makes it a lot easier to buy into it. I do not think I know anyone like Tom, but I did not buy into the whole downfall. I totally bought into him falling in love and some of my favorite moments was when he was falling in love with her. When they had finally broken up I felt as if he overreacted, but a lot of people do not agree with me. Maybe that is exactly how people would react to that type of situation, but since I would not act that way and I feel as if he was just taking it really badly and needed to grow up. I love the characters in every other sense though. I thought JGL nailed some of those scenes to perfection and I loved when they were lying on the bed in Ikea and she says that she is not looking for something serious and his cheek twitches and you have a fantastic reaction shot there. Subtle in every way, but extremely telling if you noticed it. I have thought some of the exact thoughts as he did and I am one of those guys that could fall in love like that, but in the end I feel if some of it was too far reaching for me to relate to.<br/><br/>I liked the non-linear story telling, but for me it also detracted from the movie a little bit because I was constantly reminded of Tom's reaction to being dumped. So that made the movie fun also took something away from the movie for me.<br/><br/>I loved the little sister and how her innocence actually produced some fantastic advice. That actress is someone to watch in the future. I loved how the friends could not help him, but his sister can. I guess it is Weber's way of saying that Tom's views on love are very much like a child and very innocent.<br/><br/>I loved the illustration part of the movie and it felt good to watch.<br/><br/>I guess I did not really like how the movie's ending was kind of cliché and tried to sew things together nicely in the end, but I loved how Tom kept his innocence and his hope for that love. As silly as the last line was I loved it and would not change it no matter how sappy it was.<br/><br/>The ending dragged a bit and I think it showed that Weber is a first time director, but none of this stops this from being a good movie and something I thoroughly enjoyed watching.<br/><br/>The last thing I have to mention is I loved the dance scene and how spot on it was. The Han Solo reference could not have been better done. It made me so happy to see that.<br/><br/>In the end the movie just did not click with me as much as it did with other people because I do not know people that would react that way nor would I react in that way even though I am like Tom in more ways than one."

There might be more to it than that, but it's a story about love and how we romanticize it versus how it really is, regardless of its disclaimer. <br/><br/>It's a bold script from first-time scribes Scott Neustadter and Michael H.

As such, it's bound to appeal to both the chick flick crowd and indie-lovers -- it will get audiences thinking more perceptively about love, while still appealing to the pleasures of escapist movie-theater romance.<br/><br/>Like eight of the last ten indie love stores you've seen, ""Summer"" starts with a break-up, only it backtracks to the beginning of the relationship and tells the story from the beginning (while of course jumping back to the time of the break-up). Confused? Conveniently a counter helps us keep track of time in the film, showing us how many days into the 500 we are at all times. <br/><br/>Anyway, Tom is a hopeless romantic greeting-card writer played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""3rd Rock from the Sun"" child star and Heath Ledger look-alike) who meets a girl, Summer (big-blue-eyed rising star Zooey Deschanel). He believes he's found destiny -- she doesn't want anything serious.<br/><br/>The two hit it off with their playful personalities and while Tom falls hopelessly in love with her, she doesn't seem to budge. We start to hate on Summer a little bit for not prescribing to this fated romance we've built up in our heads because we're all sucker's for that kind of a love story, but that's where ""Summer"" gets smart on us.<br/><br/>Directed by Marc Webb, who's done music videos with Green Day, 3 Doors Down and Jesse McCartney, ""Summer"" does take on this whimsical quality that very much appeals to a younger generation. At the same time, he brings us realism when the movie is supposed to relate to us the most (in the bars, at the office) and that artsy quality when the writing calls for something a bit more non-traditional. He handles the contrast well, as does Gordon- Levitt, who is either playing a depressed pessimist or a head-over-heels optimist. Deschanel is also terrific, looking the part of this elusive girl with classic good looks and emphasizing her quirks as well her brutal honesty. If she can break her indie typecast, Deschanel will become one of the finer actresses of her generation.<br/><br/>As told by the film's slightly obnoxious and inconsistently used narrator, ""this is not a love story"" ends up serving to prep us for the film's divergence from formula. For those that want happily ever after, it tempers this expectation, pleading with us by basically saying ""please don't get get mad if the ending isn't the magical song and dance number you were hoping for."" <br/><br/>But it ends up being pretty clear what ""Summer"" is trying to do. It serves as the writers' own discovery of what exactly love is, how they worked out and reconciled the pain and heartbreak -- love's truths -- with this romanticized idealizing of love. Summer becomes not this cold person who is having her way with Tom because he's the one in love, but someone with simply a different understanding of love, who comes from a different place mentally/emotionally when it comes to relationships.<br/><br/>""Summer"" is a great film because it combines all the cheesy energy that we love about romantic comedies with this strong sense of reality. Although the reality too can become a bit much at times, ""Summer"" is a film that has finally found a way to appease the masses while breaking the formula that has kept the boy meets girl story on a ball and chain for decades. It's not a perfect, but what a feat that is. ~MMR<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/"
"m2dad","9","0","1","10 August 2009"," The way love works
","I won't summarize the movie as it has been done so ably many times in previous comments. I will say that the movie accurately depicts how ""love"" works. The fact is, you feel how you feel and you have no control over that. Summer was cynical about love, and set out to enjoy her time with Tom without an emotional investment. Tom, on the other hand was willing to put everything out there for this ""relationship."" Who was the more honest? Summer who made clear from the start she would remain detached emotionally? Or, Tom who was for the most part an open book when it came to what he wanted and what he was willing to risk for Summer? Both, in fact, were equal in their honesty. Both remained true to themselves. Although, you might argue that Summer was playing ""games"" in fact she was not. And, that is born out in the end when she finds someone who trips her trigger, so to speak. That is when she loses her cynicism and is capable of investing emotionally in a relationship. She just needed to meet the right person. That is how love works. Not to be forgotten, Tom, of course, is wounded by Summer's rejection. He laments the fact that she didn't tell him about her engagement, but the fact is he had been warned from the very beginning when he met Summer. A lot of pain can be avoided if we would just really listen to what we are being told and not just plow ahead because of what we think we want and need. As a result Tom becomes the bitter, hurt, and cynical one. And, that also is how love works. Love can put us on top of the highest peak or it can pull us down into the depths of hell. But, as with Summer, and as with Tom at the end, often when we feel we are incapable of loving, of committing, of sharing our time, and investing emotionally, we meet someone who makes us come alive and changes our perspective on love and life. That is also how loves works. Despite the disclaimer at the beginning of ""500 Days of Summer,"" this truly was a love story."

","""This is not a love story. This is a story about love."" Narrator<br/><br/>Because I've been in love more than once, and not always successfully, I'm grateful for the dose of reality that underpins (500) Days of Summer—a romantic comedy hitting the common-sense chord regularly and sweetly. Despite the above narrator's disclaimer, this is a love story that takes a different path than the usual romcom, and it does discourse about love as it depicts lovers in battle.<br/><br/>The two leads, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom and indie favorite Zooey Deschanel as Summer, are as cute as could possibly be, playing young lovers who look as if they were meant to be together—but wait, I get ahead of myself.<br/><br/>From the get-go, Tom is not in the power position because Summer is forthright that she does not want a boyfriend or a relationship. What she actually wants is not fully disclosed, a lack of transparency when this almost two hander doesn't disclose her motivation to avoid romantic entanglement, a philosophy that doesn't appear in the denouement. Tom's depressing job as a writer of vapid greeting cards reinforces the dead-end doom of lyrical love.<br/><br/>As romantic comedies go, this is a cut above this summer's fare (remember My Life in Ruins): the ""buddies"" are not slackers although one is a bit of an airhead; the challenges are credible; and most of all, the expectations for a regular comedy to end well are not met. In short, the romance is troubled from the beginning because of Summer's unusual attitudes about freedom and Tom's unwillingness to face up to the reality that the one woman in his life may not be the right one.<br/><br/>Throughout the film we are reminded of time, specifically the 500 days, by regular notices about what day of the relationship the next scene is in. The jumble of time works because we know when the scene is set, regardless of whether or not the story is linear.<br/><br/>Toward the end, a philosophy about fate is offered as an antidote to the confusions of love; it's about time someone asserted that love may not be ordained by fate.<br/><br/>""Amor vincit omnia."""
"JohnArmitage4","8","0","3","19 July 2009"," A More ""Realistic"" Romantic Comdey
","I went into the film expecting a slightly above average romantic comedy, what I got was a pleasantly surprising re-evaluation of the classic pop-culture take on love. In ""(500) Days of Summer"" Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) takes on the role of the romantic one in the relationship, with Summer, played expertly by Zooey Deschanel. Her nuanced performance combine well with the way the film is edited. The film's non-linear narrative helps to keep the viewers interest as well as to contrast Tom's life before, during, and after his relationship with Summer. The audience sees, as Tom himself pieces it together, how Summer distanced herself from Tom in subtle ways that the film revisits and thus emphasizes. I can't help but compare the film to ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", for the two are both romantic comedies told out of chronological order. Although, (500)DoS is less extreme in its distortion of time to organize its plot. Solid writing, acting, and editing make (500) DoS a step above your typical Romantic Comedy, and one that I recommend."
"Chris Knipp","8","0","2","19 July 2009"," Rom-com with a twist is really conventional -- but still sweet
","(500) Days of Summer is a romantic comedy with a new approach. What is original is not the indie mannerisms of this Sundance hit -- the references to groups like The Smiths, the meet-cute at a greeting card company, the tendentious voice-over, or the jumbled chronology, but the fact that the couple doesn't live happily ever after. This is the story of a love affair that goes south. It's made clear right off the bat that the wooing of Summer (Zooey Deschanel) by Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) led to disappointment for Tom. With its downbeat story arc and only mildly hopeful finale, Days defeats genre expectations. But it still works within a highly conventional framework.<br/><br/>And so you'd better like the stars. The faces of Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel dominate the screen. Indeed they seem a cute and well-matched couple, the reedy, deep-voiced Gordon-Levitt, with his buttoned-down appearance and mobile face, and the winsome, wide-eyed Deschanel. Gordon-Levitt has the more interesting and challenging role. He runs a gamut of emotions, beginning interested and doubtful when Summer becomes the boss's assistant at the greeting card company where he works; then growing hopeful, falling in love, walking on air (even doing a song and dance number with a movie-musical chorus line) after they finally have sex, playful and delighted; then despairing, hopes dashed, numbed, drunken; and briefly hopeful again after a separation when Summer walks away from Tom and her job, and they meet once more on the way to a wedding, she invites him to a party, and he thinks they'll get back together. Gordon-Leavitt is good: he's always working, and it never shows.<br/><br/>Deschanel is less interesting to observe. Her character is bland and elusive. Summer seems to alternate only between giving in and pushing away. It's hard not to think, if you're a man, that Summer's a terrible tease; that she breaks Tom's heart without a qualm. Didn't she say she just wanted to be friends? Yes, she did. So from the female viewpoint, Tom is pushy and adolescent. He doesn't listen. But then why does Summer engage with Tom in experimental shower sex and humorously play house with him at Ikea? He's a romantic who believes in destiny. The twist is that Summer is converted to a belief in these things by finding a man, but that man is not Tom. Meanwhile the failure of his romance with Summer has shattered Tom's romantic illusions. One good thing comes out of it for him: he can't write cheery jingles anymore and goes back to pursuing a career as an architect.<br/><br/>Deschenel has had many roles in films, but they linger mostly on notes that are winsome and fey; she's the Hollywood quirky deadpan girl (notable efforts are All the Real Girls, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy , and Tin Man). Gordon-Leavitt, on the other hand, has shown daring and skill in the range of roles he's played in Manic (a violent, disturbed youth), The Lookout (a brain-damaged sports hero who turns to crime), Latter Days (a homophobic Mormon) Mysterous Skin (a gay hustler), Brick (a high school detective), and Stop-Loss (a gung-ho young soldier). He's been good in all of these and they've been interesting films. The conventionality of this relatively mainstream rom-com role in (500) Days of Summer is, paradoxically, a new challenge for him. Deschanel, who definitely had a fresh appeal when she started out, has chosen some notably dubious films to be in, such as Elf, Failure to Launch, Yes Man, and The Happening. Though fans of Deschanel say this is one of her best parts, both the actress and the writing of her character weaken the film. Snapshots of previous lovers aside, Summer has no background, her job is undefined, and we don't get to know her friends. The cute but recessive Deschanel doesn't emerge as a clearcut personality.<br/><br/>Despite the twist of the negative ending, the more you think about (500) Days of Summer the more conventional it seems. Its worst element is its gratingly insistent shifts back and forth in time over the famous 500 days, signaled by an on screen clicker whose specificity (day 442, day 3, day 157, whatever) doesn't keep it from being ultimately numbing and confusing. If you can keep all these numbers in your head, good for you; but the shuffling seems anything but enlightening. Sure, it's meant to convey the mosaic of feelings a tangled relationship leaves behind in he memory of the victim. But it's also a needless distraction, a ""modernist"" device to keep the audience busy but a sign the filmmakers neglected the harder job of crafting a coherent narrative. A reversed or jumbled chronology is a cliché by now. The only enlightenment we get from this one is a sense of the obvious: that sometimes things were going well between Tom and Summer, and sometimes they weren't. And that Summer always saw things differently from Tom, because he fell in love and she knew all along he wasn't the one.<br/><br/>Something utterly routine is the pair of buddies who'd like to advise Tom but can't because the nerdy McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) is a perpetual loser with the ladies and the chiseled-cheeked Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) has been with the same girl since elementary school. The only difference from convention is that they aren't comical or tricksters as in films like 40 Days and 40 Nights or Knocked Up.<br/><br/>But while the latter two movies may be more fun, (500) Days of Summer, despite my reservations, is enjoyable viewing because of the cute couple that charms you and the heartbreak that touches you. Cuteness and charm and heartbreak, if you don't intrude on them too much, go a long way, and even the convoluted time-scheme can't obliterate them. But if Marc Webb and writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber sought to reinvent the wheel, they still came up with the familiar round utensil."
"joshsauberman","9","0","1","17 July 2009"," Way better than I expected!
","I was pretty reluctant to see this movie, but I had a free pass (for an advanced screening of it) so I went. I expected a cheesy chick-flick love story. It was a sort of love story, but I'm thrilled I saw it. The movie was a lot of fun. Sort of sad, but always upbeat and keeps you laughing.<br/><br/>I normally see movies that only get good reviews and that are typically ""guy friendly"", but I am actually quite thrilled to have seen this movie. It was excellent. 500 Days of Summer leaves you feeling a happy and optimistic. It could be the perfect date movie (unless you're in a relationship that's coming to an end... in which case it could actually be the best thing to two could go to see.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for anybody (but not really for kids)!"
