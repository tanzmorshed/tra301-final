"Skeletors_Hood","Null","207","222","29 October 2004"," Why Mulan sticks out as a great Disney film.
","I was impressed by this Disney film for so many reasons, too many to list here, but I will go on the record as saying that Mulan has got to be one of the best Disney female characters that ever saw production, in the midst of a colorful and artistic film, that will resonate in your memory.<br/><br/>Mulan sticks out in my mind for this reason. For once, we have a strong female lead, or at the least, stronger than most of them. She isn't counted among the Disney ""princesses"" line-up. She doesn't want for herself, and she seeks to look deeper within herself to discover her inner being. She isn't like Ariel, who wants to be someone else. She isn't like Jasmine, who sits in luxury, waiting to be swept off her feet by Prince Charming, just like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and almost any female character that Disney brings to life. And while she does share some traits among this list, she stands out because she does something that these do not. She uses her mind. <br/><br/>Mulan, in fact, has more in common with male Disney leads than the female Disney leads. Mulan is a thinker, and a do-er. She's resourceful, like Aladdin. She is quick to act, like Eric (mermaid.) And she sacrifices herself for the sake of others, like Hercules. She also speaks her mind, even in a culture that does not allow such a thing. She doesn't waste time pining about ""will I ever find true love?"" Indeed, we see that she has an attraction to Shang (as he was her husband in the legends,) but we see her uncomfortable and unsure of meeting the Match-maker. She begs for her father's life when Chi-Fu came to the village. When you see her make her decision to take her father's place in the army, she does so out of her love for him, valuing his life above hers. She doesn't wish to become a man to see what it is like or for a change. Only to save his life. She later doubts herself and her reasons for going, but she did so because of her inner strengths, something other female Disney leads too often lack. (And it is these strengths that Shang is attracted to at the end.)<br/><br/>This movie also has a simple, but very effective villain, Shan Yu. Though not as memorable as Jafar or Ursula, he is more effective and more menacing because he is not fantastic. By that, I mean that he is not magical, he holds no special power. He is portrayed as a man, and as a man that could have truly existed, performing vicious acts that men do. We see the destruction that his army lays to a village, and when Mulan finds the doll, it shows that Shan Yu left no one living, man, woman or child. This is what makes him so effective as a villain, showing how truly human he indeed is. Granted, the producers did not develop him in any great depth, but they showed enough of him to remind us of his threat to China. Besides, sometimes the better villains are the ones you don't know too much about, or see a lot of.<br/><br/>Of the rest of the supporting cast, I will only mention four of them as being memorable in any real way. Chi-Fu, the emperor's consultant, was a reminder of the way many men looked at women in this culture. He thrusts his head up when Mulan begs for her father's life, and when she is discovered to be a woman, though she is a hero, he is quick to insult her, and to order her execution, simply because she impersonated a man. The other three were, of course, her comrades, Ling, Yao, and Chian Po. Though they were mainly comic relief (almost like a 3 stooges set,) they remained loyal to Mulan and trusted her fully, even after she was discovered. I like them, because they were not discriminatory to her in any way, even trying to stop her execution. When Mulan told them she had an idea to help the emperor faster, they were the first to her side, even when Shang was still reluctant to do so.<br/><br/>Overall, a wonderful movie to the Disney list. If you haven't seen it, then do so, you won't regret it.<br/><br/>And yes, Mushu was a cool character as well.<br/><br/>**** In Response to an earlier post by Phoenix-1 **** To expect any movie to accurately portray history in any way is lunacy. Even those movies that come close to historical accuracy are flawed in many ways. This was a way of telling a story, as any movie is. It can be argued that it tries to provoke curiosity in another culture, but it is also meant to entertain. I would also like to point out that Mulan is really not ""historical,"" like Joan of Arc, but rather she is a legend, much like Hercules and Aladdin, who also come from the realm of myth, stories and legends. And while there is some difference between the original legend and this movie, your examples of how Disney would butcher tales of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln do not compare to this story in any way. Your arguments for comparison should be better applied to Pocahontas, as she was an actual historical figure."
"Emma97","10","69","77","3 December 1998"," The growth of the typical Disney heroine
","There are two things I love about this movie, aside from its stunning and beautiful animation.  One is that I love the fact that Disney is exploring legends from other cultures and I am so glad it brought us this one.  The other is that I just wanted to stand up and cheer at this great heroine.  I am a huge fan of Disney movies, but most of the heroines, while spunky, are still just your basic damsel in distress.  I loved Mulan's character.  She was strong, she was powerful, she could do anything she wanted, and she overcame much diversity.  I was thrilled to see the portrayal of a strong female character surviving because of her own integrity and strength rather than because of her looks.  Bravo, Disney, for bringing us this wonderfully progressive Chinese tale."
"Lady_Targaryen","8","24","25","21 January 2006"," The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.
","One of the reasons why I like Mulan so much, is because she is independent and braver than many of the female characters from Disney, who looks always to be searching for a man to be the reason for them to live or to be happy. Mulan is lovely, but also a tomboy what always gives her problems. Since the story takes place in a China of more than 1.000 years ago, women from that time, more than in the present days, needed to have an outstanding behavior all the time and with everybody.Being the only kid her parents had in a time where women didn't have many rights,Mulan is pressed to marry with a good catch. One day, she is going to see the matchmaker but everything goes wrong,since she is clumsy and not very graceful. Being accused that she '' will never bring honor to her family'', Mulan stays sad and depressed, and so stays her parents. But the chance to change that awful prophecy comes quick when the Emperor's men started to call one man from every family to serve in the Imperial Army: since Mulan's father was no longer young and healthy, Mulan reported to the army with a new name and looks. But she needed to make this a secret, because it was against the Chinese laws to a woman be a soldier, so, with the help of the dragon of the family called Mushu,one of the coolest adventures from Disney's starts."
"chrisbrown6453","8","82","94","17 June 2002"," Disney comes through with yet another animated masterpiece, and this one goes by the name Mulan.
","Mulan is a young girl in ancient China. When the Huns start attacking the country, the Emperor orders one member of every family to join the Chinese Army and defend the country. The one member must be a man, but in Mulan's family, the only male is her injured father. Not wanting to allow her father to die, Mulan dresses like a man, and escapes into the night to join the war. To protect her, the ancient elders of her family ask the great Stone Dragon to watch over her. Unfortunately, the great Stone Dragon is destroyed by the little tiny dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy). So with Mushu and a small cricket by her side, Mulan heads off to help destroy the Huns.<br/><br/>
I think we can all guess what happens. Mulan, although a woman, manages to save the day. The plot line isn't really a surprise when you break it down. And the animation is, by now, expected to be great, and Mulan certainly lives up to the great Disney tradition. It's the story and the feeling you get that makes this movie so wonderful. Disney went through a lot to make sure it's depiction of ancient China was accurate. From the decorations on the walls, to the matchmakers, to the great honor in family, Disney manages to show what the country of China was like, and in many ways, still is today. Following the Disney tradition, there is a strong female character, this time taking lead. There are the over the top bad guys, and of course, the comic relief. Eddie Murphy was just down right hilarious in this movie. I wish they had showed more of him. The songs were sort of a change of pace, with Matthew Wilder and Jerry Goldsmith doing the honors, and not the venerable Alan Menken. The music was good, but the lyrics in some of the songs were weak. <br/><br/>The reason I feel Mulan was better than recent Disney fare like Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame is because it had a much more lively feel to it. Hercules was very dark, animation-wise. Everything was centered on the color blue, so it didn't feel alive. And The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a more adult story, and some of the scenes were very dark and broody. Mulan took a simple plot, put it in ancient China, and made it very colorful and fun to watch. It was light, and ""Disney"" enough for kids to enjoy, while still being adult enough for the parents to enjoy. <br/><br/>Overall, I'd say Mulan is definitely one to watch. Disney animation has done it again."
"mdm-11","8","61","73","1 June 2005"," More Disney Magic -- Historically Accurate Legend
","There are too few ""girl"" heroes in stories. According to Chinese legend, Mulan, the only child of an aging soldier, disguised herself as a male to take her sickly father's place fighting evil invaders. While in the disguise of a loyal soldier to the emperor, Mulan falls in love with her commander, who does not suspect the deception. When Mulan saves the entire fighting forces, what she managed to hide up to that point is discovered: She is a girl masquerading as a man. Rather than punish Mulan with death, the commander sends her away (presumably to die). In the end Mulan is honored with a medal for bravery by the Emperor himself. Although ""only"" a female, she had saved the entire empire from certain doom.<br/><br/>The finest moment is the scene where her father says ""I am proud to call you daughter"". Legend or history, this is a fine example of telling a story centering around a girl, rather than the countless tales celebrating boys as heroes. Like so many other recent animated Disney features, this is yet another gem in the treasure chest of Walt Disney Studios."
"MartinHafer","9","25","28","10 June 2007"," I really liked this Disney flick that seemed to slip between the cracks
","In the 1990s, I felt that Disney made quite a few undistinguished cartoons following Aladdin. Unlike most of the world, I wasn't all that enamored with THE LION KING and subsequent offerings such as the wretched HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and POCAHONTAS were huge disappointments. Sure, POCAHONTAS is a lovely film to watch, but it's so wrong historically and it's so politically correct and hokey. And as for HUNCHBACK, the story was so dark and unappealing, I have no idea WHO the intended audience was. So it was in this context that I expected to hate or at least be underwhelmed by MULAN. Instead, it seemed fresh, well-made, humorous and fun--something distinctly missing from these other films. While the anachronistic aspect of having a lady warrior is problematic, for once Disney had another strong and likable female lead following Belle in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. This was a definite home-run for Disney and well worth your time whether you are a child or an adult."
"lichan-1","9","89","111","8 January 2006"," Great Movie for little girls
","I have a 4.5 year old daughter who is going through the princess phase. We read lots of fairy tales etc and its very difficult to find a fairy tale where the princess is strong and resourceful. Most of the time they are pretty passive and the worst one is sleeping beauty. I find myself treading a fine line between letting her enjoy the fairy tale and occasionally commenting on the fact that perhaps some of these princesses just don't do enough to help themselves and how they can help themselves a little bit more. I don't want to destroy her pleasure in these fairy tales, after all, I loved them too. But it took me a while as adult to see how the subconscious message of helplessness in these fairy tales can reinforce the existing values of society and parents that girls are meant to be saved. <br/><br/>So it is a great pleasure to be able to show my daughter a story of a strong and intelligent girl - Mu Lan and its great that Mu Lan and we are both ethnically Chinese. Here is a heroine who is resourceful, uses her brains, saves the Captain and China. We draw many discussion points from the story, such as why it is that women were not allowed to join the army, the value of trying hard and training and practising hard, what is discipline and why it is needed to succeed, using your brains and thinking of how to solve a problem, not just using brute strength, etc. Even some politics - like why did the Hun king want the Emperor to bow to him and why the Emperor wouldn't bow to him but would bow to Mulan. My challenge is the explain things in a way which is both accurate and yet understandable to a 4 year old. My daughter loves the story because Mulan does a lot of ""saving"". <br/><br/>My daughter has probably watch the movie only 3 times coz I limit TV and video a lot. But she'll ask me to tell her the story in my own words, based on the video. It works out great.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie Mulan captivates me as an adult also helps. There's only so much I can enjoy of a barney video. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie to parents with young girls, as a good place to start talking about being a strong and intelligent woman. Another good one is Beauty and the Beast. I've not seen Pocahontas so I can't comment on that."
"rbverhoef","8","55","67","19 May 2003"," Another great Disney
","I can't think of a single animated feature film done by Disney that I don't like. For some reason they never bore me and they never feel the same. The classics like 'Snow White' and 'Cinderella' are great but I think I like the newer ones ('The Little Mermaid', 'Beauty and the Beast', 'The Lion King') even more. 'Mulan' definitely belongs to the best ones.<br/><br/>Mulan is a girl who doesn't do much right. For the honor of her family she joins the army instead of her father. She takes his gear and runs off. She pretends to be a man and does the training to go to war against the Huns who invaded China.<br/><br/>With some nice new songs, great music by Jerry Goldsmith and beautiful animations this is a real Disney. A little dragon called Mushu is helping her on the way. He is send by the ancestors. The voice of Mushu is from Eddie Murphy and he does a very great job. With a quick and good story and a lot of funny moments this is a great movie."
"King_Opossum","Null","32","39","31 March 2000"," Excellent, if a little different
","Now I must admit I wasn't sure about this one. MULAN seemed to break most of my preconceived rules on Disney movies. These included the fairytale element - a cross-dressing Chinese soldier doesn't have the same magical appeal as, say, the son of the Greek gods searching for his birthright, etc etc. Also, this verge towards realism meant that the bad guy would not be as appealing - Disney villains are camp, over-the-top thespians by rule - Jeremy Irons in THE LION KING for example. I was concerned about the absence of king-of-melody composer Alan Menken, whose wonderful songs encapsulate the charm of Disney.<br/><br/>However, that said, I thought this film was wonderful. The characters were well thought out and expertly drawn. Not enough songs were present for my liking, but those that were fit perfectly with the story, and the chance to hear the wonderful voice of Lea Salonga (Mulan's songs) is worth the price of this film alone. Eddie Murphy has managed to be as good, if not better, than Robin Williams as the comic sidekick. And the film's conclusion is as genuine and as heartfelt as any adaptation of this story. The mountain scene contains some of the best animation I have seen from Disney, and the rousing score from maestro Jerry Goldsmith accompanies the action superbly.<br/><br/>This may not turn out to be a classic in the same way as THE LION KING and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, but I enjoyed it immensely. Go see it now!!!"
"noralee","7","12","13","8 November 2005"," Delightful Animated Girl Hero who Breaks with Disney Traditions
","""Mulan"" is not quite a chick flick and it's much better than ""Pochantas."" <br/><br/>It has terrific animation and I forgot I was even watching animation. The script has some funny lines. <br/><br/>The music is not great (the writers didn't ring any bells with me as to their past work) but good lyrics. I was disappointed that the music wasn't as Asianish as ""Lion King"" is Africanish. And the final rap is a bit off-putting, though the segue into the Stevie Wonder song was fun.<br/><br/>Eddie Murray isn't Robin Williams but he's fun. At least they do use quite a few Asian actors' voices - Wing Na Wen (""E.R.""), George Takei (""Star Trek""), B.D. Wong (""Oz"") Pat Morita (""Karate Kid""). <br/><br/>I think ""Mulan"" is the first Disney animation post-Katzenberg and there's a couple of digs at him and responses to the criticisms of how he did the girl stars. There was a lot of criticism of how Katzenberg personally insisted on Jasmine in ""Aladdin""s impossible Barbie shape and ""Mulan"" takes that on with a line about how stupid it is to want such a narrow waist. Definitely a much more positive body image movie than under the Katzenberg regime. <br/><br/>There's no dead mother syndrome here, well for Mulan anyway. The Captain's mother isn't mentioned. Not only is there a mom, but even a grandmom. The father is still Freudian - he's wounded. All the Disney dads of daughters have some incapacity or other or tragic flaw.<br/><br/>Refreshingly, there's no wedding at the end with birds chirping as a canopy. The courting is assumed and the grandmom invites the captain to live there forever--but Mulan shuts her up. <br/><br/>(originally written 7/23/1998)"
"jewel_of_ia","10","15","17","22 April 2005"," Actually my favorite movie in the world
","I know this sounds silly, but Mulan is actually my all-time favorite movie. Trust me, I am a perfectly intelligent young woman who likes to read and is going to college, but there's just something about Mulan that I have always loved. It suffered a lot in release because it was lost in an avalanche of new CGI movies like A Bug's Life. But Mulan's story is every bit as good as those movies, even if you find the animation less impressive.<br/><br/>The strengths of the movie for me are not the songs (which are very weak compared to earlier Disney), nor the animation (which is charming with a few Chinese flourishes) or any other technical aspect of the movie production. What makes this moving great is that it has a truly endearing, likable main character. While in most Disney movies the silly sidekicks or cute animals steal the show, in this movie Mulan is both funny and brave, making her a truly human character that I rooted for whole-heartedly.<br/><br/>I am also a crazy feminist and for me this movie is the ultimate girl-power movie. Who would of thought that could ever be said of a Disney movie? But really, Mulan, as a Chinese tomboy who never quite feels that she fits in in her society, is an excellent picture of a woman finally proving to the world that she can do everything a man can do. After watching the movie (which I have done over 15 times) I always feel really inspired and motivated! Seriously! The movie without a doubt has lots of production problems (bad songs, clichÃ©d side-characters, mediocre villain), but I still highly, highly recommend because fundamentally the characters are likable and believable and the plot is well constructed. Oh and I think it's pretty damn funny. Mushu always makes me laugh, and watching Mulan try to spit is still the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>If you want the classic singing, dancing fairy tale-style Disney movies a la The Little Mermaid, this is not quite what you're looking for. Mulan is more character driven and less lavishly made. But it absolutely belongs in the upper ranks of Disney, and it's a pity that Disney couldn't have continued to make animated features of this quality."

"bob the moo","Null","49","70","26 December 2003"," Despite a few weak songs this is a great cartoon
","Mulan is a tomboy of sorts - not something that is looked for in a Chinese wife, and she causes constant worry and dishonour to her family.  When the Huns attack China, the Emperor commands each family to put one man forward to fight.  With Mulan's aged father the only man of the family it looks like he must fight, but Mulan dresses as a man and takes his place.  With the help of dragon Mushu, Mulan overcomes her status as a woman to help take on the Hun.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure I would like this film as I have grown a little tired of the Disney formula of `songs, romance and smartassed comedy sidekicks', which Mulan sticks to pretty well, however I did really enjoy this film.  I think it was mainly because of the sweep of the story, the big battles and the majestic feel to the movie.  The plot moves swiftly and felt like it was all over too quickly.  It has the usual mix of laughs for parents and kids as well as having quite a good story behind it all.<br/><br/>The only major weakness is the songs.  I didn't exactly start tapping my feet at any of them and, while they are not bad per se, they aren't great and after a few lines I was wanting to skip past them (but couldn't - it was showing on TV).  Asides from these the film is funny and quite dramatic and is good fun to watch.  The cast are good.  Ming-Na is a good Mulan while Murphy rehearses for Shrek with his smart mouthed dragon that gets plenty of good laughs.  DB Wong is a good actor but has a `straight' role and doesn't distinguish himself.  I was worried at first by the presence of Harvey Fierstein, but he did good work and wasn't half as irritating as he usually is.<br/><br/>With colourful animation that is good without being Pixar, this is a good cartoon that is fun, funny and, at times, dramatic.  I'm not a big fan of Disney over the last few years but I did really enjoy this film and would watch it again."

","I really held back from Disney's later animated features, most of them started to slid down hill after The Lion King, excluding The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but it seemed like Mulan was going to be a disappointment for Disney. It turned out to be an actual pleasure watching this film. It had great animation, a good soundtrack, and a wonderful story about courage and strength.<br/><br/>Mulan is a girl in China who is ready for marriage but seems like she isn't ready to settle down in this man's world where she must have permission to speak and only cook and please her husband. When her father is called to war, she fears for his life and dresses like him and fights in his place disguised as him. Mushu, her ""guardian"" dragon per say, comes to help her out and make sure she doesn't get herself killed out there in battle. She also falls for the captain that doesn't kill her when he finds out her secret.<br/><br/>It is a visually stunning masterpiece that I am glad that I had a chance to watch. It had great morals and values for children, even if it was a bit unrealistic, we have to let go. Still, I don't think a film will compare yet to The Lion King or Beauty and The Beast, but Mulan is a treasure of it's own.<br/><br/>7/10"

"Chris Engelbrecht","Null","31","44","29 December 2000"," I loved it...
","Ok... I've read through most of the posted comments posted before this about this movie; I find that some people love the music, but think the characters are thin; some hate Eddie Murphy's presence, and think the love story is stupid. Well, your experience with a film is individual, I guess.<br/><br/>That said, I'll follow the trail and state why I loved watching this movie not once, but several times:<br/><br/>First of all, I'm far from being a fan of animated Disney classics. I'm in that age between child and adult(currently 23), where everything is a rebelry. Most of my viewing pleasures is action or its like.<br/><br/>My original incentive for seeing this movie was to please a friend of mine, who has a long-life fascination for oriental culture (read: karate films!). When Mulan was released in Denmark, a single copy with the original voices track (usually all animated Disneys are dubbed into danish with good result) was shown in a local theater. Asking a couple of girls out, we went and saw it. Ok, I was blown away. Before I had left the cinema that day, I too was captured by chinese history and culture. The singing and music I was prepared for; I knew The Jungle Book and Aristocats from childhood. The songs didn't mean anything to me, other than that they were few - good for me. (Some of them do kling to the ear - irritating for me!) I quickly realised Eddie Murphy was on the voices cast. I started liking the movie right then. Some find him malplaced in a Disney epic, but fact is that the business of animating classics is profiting well these years in bringing in already established names to the animations; Tom Hanks in the Toy Stories, Mel Gibson in Pocahontas, Robin Williams in Aladdin, and who else I don't know of. These names sell the film before the film have a chance to sell itself. (The danish producers, by the way, have stolen this idea when dubbing the films, using local media stars for the voice cast.) Well...it did work for me. Eddie Murphy is not as funny in this production as he is in others, but what the heck...he can't exactly use too much harsh language, it IS a children's flick. But with the room he got, his speedy tongue made me laugh again and again. I have later seen Aladdin, and find Eddie Murphy's achievement as funny as Robin Williams'. That Eddie Murphy chose this project was an interesting and probably very clever career move. Later, when I studied the rest of the cast list, I noticed a lot of chinese names. That very much pleased me. Who other than Chinese people to tell a Chinese tale to Westerners? I found some old friends, Soon-Tek Oh and James Hong, people who had worked with Chick Norris in the 80's. Pat Morita as the emperor made me smile. B.D.Wong I remembered from Jurrasic Park, but Ming-Na was new to me (had to look her up in IMDB, was stunned not to have known her before (Ok, I went wow!)). Harvey Fierstein as a ploppy little soldier and Miguel Ferrer as the Hun leader I found the perfect voice-choice for their characters...other names rang also. Anyway, a lot of the above have only value after you've seen the film. When you are an Atlantic ocean from most of the sales pitch, the film had to sell itself. It did - for me, anyway. Before then, I knew little about China and her history apart from things here and there (read: karate films!). Meeting angient China like this totally threw me away. Wership of the ancestors, the power and position of the emperor, I found myself lost in the dream of a world long gone; I loved the image of a China with different traditions but still found myself attracted to the pro-Disney story about a girl standing up to a culture's sexist prejudice. (I do find the plot a bit silly, actually, but I let myself be taken away...it's just a Disney.) Agree, the characters lack a little bit, the love story of Mulan and Shang should perhaps have had a few more frames to play with. The project was a little bit tuned down from the Disney board of directors, but honor to all who worked with it: You people did a good job! The computer animation used for the Great Wall and the attack of the Huns startles me again and again; Not many live movies can do the job as good.<br/><br/>So that's what Mulan is for me...The dream of ancient China and Eddie Murphy's speedy tongue. I accept the term classic. I have the damn thing on video now (English language) and must prevent myself from seeing it too often, in fright of one day getting tired of it."
"musicalfan","10","7","8","26 March 2005"," One of the best animated movies out there
","Mulan is my favorite animated movie. This is a true Disney gem that a person of any age will enjoy. Disney has truly outdone itself this time, it's too bad that Disney doesn't make traditional musical films like this anymore. It has a good storyline that keeps the audience interested. The backdrops are wonderfully drawn. The songs are memorable and entertaining, plus they're sung by two very good singers: Lea Salonga and Donnie Osmond. I'm so glad they got Jerry Goldsmith to score this movie. It's music is definitely its best asset (with an academy award nomination at its belt). No animated movie has spent so much time on my cd player and on my VHS set. This cartoon is truly worth watching."
"BeautifulSinner","8","9","11","11 March 2008"," Thank you Disney, for making mulan so great!
","Mulan is a well-known ancient folktale in Chinese history. It tells the story of mulan, who disguises herself as a man and goes to the war to protect the country in place of her aged father, and finally returns as a national hero/heroine. Although the story of mulan was evidently modified from its original, Disney did a fantastic job at retelling the story, and delivered it through the beautiful hand-drawn animation that has been lost to us for many years. As a Chinese myself, I know the mulan story like millions of Chinese people do. Some people (espcially Chinese people) may not like the Disney version of mulan simply because Disney didn't stay true to the original, but i feel somewhat differently about this. Not only did i have no problem with Disney's decision to make modifications to mulan's story, I actually kinda appreciate that they did. Cuz Disney's retelling of mulan turned out to be rather amazing, and even better than the original in my opinion. I mean, the original story is great, but it lacks fun and humor, which you can find in Disney's mulan. In the Disney version, Mulan is an outgoing, smart, and independent young woman who has difficulty fitting in the more traditional and reserved ancient Chinese society, where a woman's value is judged by marrying into a good family and being a good wife. So naturally this creates conflict and inner struggle for mulan, and thus brings out the musical number ""reflection"" that expresses mulan frustrations and desires. This song is so beautifully written and the lyrics have such meaningful morals and depth that it touches me every time i hear it, and I'm a guy! This song can certainly relate to a great many of young people, not only girls but also boys, cuz its central theme is all the same, that is to be your true self regardless the environment that you in. And now back to the movie, there's a lot to love about Disney's mulan: the story, the fun characters, the songs and music, the beautiful animation, etc. The story is smoothly-paced and very believable. You have no problem understanding why things happen the way they do and why mulan has taken certain actions. And I think Disney created the characters very successfully because they made them look like real Chinese people instead of the classic Disney characters that we used to see. And they made the backgrounds in the animation look like beautiful Chinese landscape paintings, which really amazed me! And the opening of the movie is probably one of the most brilliant among the Disney animation features. I was completely blown away when i first saw it in the theater. Although Disney didn't completely stay true to the original mulan, it stayed true to the spirit of the original story and the spirit of china in most part! And as Mulan being a Chinese story, i think Disney did its best to make it look like and feel like Chinese, and i really appreciate their effort. So thank you Disney, for making mulan so great!"

","Witty, amusing little Disney movie, regardless of the horrid song element.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of the Disney musical formula. I do not like the made-for-five-year-old song element found in most Disney animations, so I tend to just ignore those sections except in movies such as ""Beauty and the Beast,"" where that activity is just not possible. I therefore avoid the movie itself, as often as I can.<br/><br/>This movie, has much of that Disney musical element, which for me, lowers the value of the movie.<br/><br/>However, the animation is far better than that of other later Disney movies, and the backgrounds are well done, which is a delightful surprise.<br/><br/>Disney has taken to ignoring detail, of late, which is a major disappointment for those of us who watch these movies for the animation quality.<br/><br/>The story itself is really very compelling, innovative, and strong. I thoroughly enjoyed this Disney attempt, although I am sure, as with all Disney sequels, they will screw up the animation quality and background value in Mulan 2. And I fully appreciated the comedic element provided by Eddie Murphy.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.2/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","That's my background - grew up with Aristocats, Jungle Book, 101 Dalmations etc but I've avoided stuff like Pocahontas and The Lion King like the plague because cutesy animals and horrible moralising have replaced wit and charm. So I gave Mulan a chance.<br/><br/>And I was really pleasantly surprised. Mulan manages to keep a reasonable flavour of Chinese/Hong Kong cinema without seeming patronising or watered-down. It's not too cute or fluffy and the villain is not even remotely camp or risible. He's just plain EVIL. Course the songs are sometimes naff, but I really loved Disney's take on the staple ""kung fu boot camp"" .<br/><br/>Even the romantic angle isn't too gloopy and soft focus, it just leaves you with a hint of a beginning.<br/><br/>Anyway for more cross-dressing martial arts heroines, check out Brigitte Lin's career."

The artful animation(watch the smoke) the terrific songs like ""Be a Man"", the laugh out loud antics of Eddie Murphy's Mushu, and a heroic, feisty, and really likable Mulan help make this movie truly special. Every time I take it down from the video shelf I'm surprised at how good it is. Some of the subject matter isn't appropriate for small children. The movie does remind us of the historical repression of women and the sorrow of war, which adds meaning to<br/><br/>the story. But overall the film is lots of fun.

","I first saw this movie as a little kid, but I still enjoy it now that i'm 15. I consider this to be one of the first GOOD movies to come out of that greedy capitalist hellhole called Disney in years. Some of the arguments against it have been ridiculous.<br/><br/>""It's racist!"" Oh come on people, it's supposed to be and adventure/war movie, not a remake of Ghandi! The Huns are bad, the Chinese are good because that's how it was in the ancient legend. A movie like this is not supposed to put political correctness before entertainment.<br/><br/>""It's discriminating against men!"" Lighten up, please. I'm a guy and I wasn't offended by this. It's from Mulan's perspective, and I think it's safe to say she was somewhat prejudiced. Besides, Shang was cool. There was nothing wrong with him.<br/><br/>""It's too violent!"" I hate to break it to you, but war happens. Yes, there are fields of bodies. Yes, the bad guys kill people. Yes, it might scare little kids. But seriously, the evening news is way more violent. These things happen, and if your kids never know about it then they're going to be pretty freaked out when they first encounter the real world.<br/><br/>In short, Mulan is a great movie for anybody who doesn't want they're kids to live in a bubble. It's got action, romance, friendship, the whole works, and would have been great even if it wasn't animated."

","Now, I'm sixteen and I still watch Disney movies more than any other type of movies out there, so some people consider me pretty childish. I don't know if that'll hurt my opinion on this film or not, but I'm giving my opinion anyways.<br/><br/>Mulan is probably one of the best Disney movies of all time. It, along with the Lion King and the Lion King II are probably the only movies I can watch more than once in a day. And yes, I have watched Mulan more than once in a day. And I've rewound (it's VHS. I still live in the '90s. Get over it) some parts over and over during those viewings. This movie is just so fantastic I can hardly put it into words. The music isn't tiresome or annoying like some Disney movies, the message is strong and a good one, and there are some dark elements in it that won't scare the children but will provide a little extra entertainment for adults.<br/><br/>I personally think that this movie should be in every household - whether there are children or teenagers or adults watching, it's fantastic."
"DesertHedgehog","10","7","9","14 September 2005"," A Movie With a Beautiful Message
","Words just cannot express the beauty in this film. Mulan, our heroine, is a sweet, yet awkward young woman who wishes to bring honor to her also-loving family.<br/><br/>After a meeting with the matchmaker goes horribly awry, Mulan is left ashamed and distraught. She wishes so badly to please and bring honor to her family, yet her spunky, outspoken attitude makes this a struggle for her in a culture where women are expected to be quiet and subservient. But despite her failure, her family still loves her.<br/><br/>That very day, the Emperor's consul comes with a declaration: one man from every family is to serve in the Emperor's army in the war against the Huns. Mulan, knowing that her father will certainly be killed if he goes to war, disguises herself as a man and goes to war in his place. The sentiment and unconditional love portrayed in this movie makes it a very beautiful story.<br/><br/>The movie also pokes some good-natured fun at males in general, but never to a ridiculous degree. The one reference to a modern media (Batman) is subtle enough that it doesn't spoil the atmosphere. Mushu sometimes feels a little overdone, but isn't too bad overall. There's enough comic relief in the movie to keep it fun.<br/><br/>Another thing going for this film is that the dilemmas faced by the characters are very, very serious. The villain isn't just set out to conquer; he's set out to slaughter. This is made very clear to the audience - and although it was kept toned down, it wasn't completely sugarcoated, either.<br/><br/>Also, I feel that Mulan is a much better role-model for girls than certain other animated characters. The love and respect that she shows for her family (especially for her father) is a breath of fresh air compared to many other animated female leads."
"acedj","9","3","3","16 March 2020"," Could be Disney's best offering, ever
","We are introduced to the title character almost immediately in this movie. She is Mulan, an awkward Chinese girl that is trying to learn what tradition dictates a Chinese woman learn. It becomes quite clear that Mulan will never be a traditional lady, even with the help of a lucky cricket given to her by her grandmother. The family has no time to recover from Mulan's failure as the Huns are invading and the Emperor decrees that each village must offer up a man from each family to fight. Being the only man in their family, Mulan's father accepts the calling, despite being a cripple. Fearing that her father will not survive, Mulan steals off in the dead of night and enlists in her father's stead. Unbeknownst to Mulan, her ancestors send a guardian to protect her. What she ends up getting is Mushu, a disgraced dragon and Crickey, the ""lucky"" cricket. Together they must work to save her lie, for discovery means death. Can Mulan help save China and defeat the Huns?<br/><br/>Though the setting of this movie is not one with which Americans can relate, the message surely is, that women can become anything they want. What I love about this movie is this fact is not crammed down your throat as it oft is with movies that have come out since. In fact, unlike many of the feminists in newer movies, you find yourself rooting for Mulan from the very beginning. This movie does a lot for female empowerment without emasculating men in the process. Having Eddie Murphy voice Mushu was the icing on the cake. I am a straight, white man, and I absolutely love this movie and watch it probably more often than I should."
"pmcollectorboy","9","3","3","25 September 2000"," Another great Disney modern
","Modern Disney is kind of a funny thing with me. Their formula, more or less, keeps getting recycled every single movie. Despite this, there are good modern Disney movies, and there are bad modern Disney movies. Yet even with the good ones, there is always some kind of funny aftertaste. Mulan is an example of a great modern Disney movie. I'll point out the good parts first and get to the funny aftertaste later.<br/><br/>First, this is a touching and dramatic story. Mulan is only the third Disney movie that was able to touch my heart, The Fox and the Hound and Bambi being the first and second. It is about a young woman's struggle to do what's right and save the life of her father, who for once is a caring but firm man and not some goofball like you see in some of the other Disney movies. This is also about her struggle to find identity, her struggle to persevere, her struggle to be like one of the men, and her struggle against the Hun army and the horrors of war.<br/><br/>Now the funny aftertaste. As usual, Disney insists on throwing in a comedic sidekick. While he is funny, it does get annoying sometimes. Some of the songs are good, but others are real snoozes. And Disney's modern formula still hasn't changed any. Disney also still insists on modernisms and pop culture.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, which appear in practically all modern Disney movies, Mulan is still a great Disney movie with a strong story. This is one the family will enjoy over and over again."

"ironhorse_iv","7","5","6","9 April 2013"," Be a man & watch this movie!
","By Disney renaissance standards, this was pretty close to what the film was actually based on, the ancient Chinese poem called the Ballad of Hua Mulan. There is a slight exception from the poem and the movie, in the fact, that she lasted ten to 12 years in the military without getting discovered. Disney got it wrong in the settling as well, the ballad is set in the Northern-Southern dynasties period (420 to 589 AD), but Mulan the film makes it look like the height of the Ming dynasty a thousand years later. Oh, she also died tragically in the ballad. She commits suicide because the emperor asked her to be a concubine. But that's beside the point. I'm just history nerding. In the end, the story is the same, Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) must pretend to be a man to save her elderly father from death in the army due to invasion with the Huns and it's leader Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer). Some people think of him as forgettable due to one of the relatively few Disney villains who doesn't have a villain song, but I like Shan Yu as a villain because he looks so scary. No, his personality isn't that great, but the dude just looks like a monster! And he's a powerhouse! He can slice through the castle pillars with one swing of his sword. He's the only Disney villain I can think of that actually causes that kind of destruction. He doesn't need to be fleshed out as a character. He's the leader of the Hun Army. The Huns were trying to conquer China and were really violent and underhanded in their tactics. He belongs with the greats. One thing that bugs me in the film is how Mulan go to the camp, and get nearly kicked out of the army for not being fit, which kinda negates, the whole point of her taking her father's place. Clearly, her father wasn't healthy so if he was sent instead of her, he would have been sent home anyways. So what was the point of replacing him? Why, didn't Mulan go home after not being fit to join the army? I think it's about giving Honor to the family. Mulan's smart in a way I can see, a cheater, a bit lazy, loving, outspoken, and just fails at all things social, but lovable. This 'wood orchid' seems like the girl-power type character for the overly feminist. If anything, I've always seen her as a person who was just trying to find her own place regardless of gender roles. She tries to act as her society's definition of a woman and fails, she tries to act as her society's definition of a man and fails. If anything, Mulan only succeeds when she acts like herself rather than the roles that are put before her. It isn't about the girl power or the male dominance, it's about people finding their own place in life. Mulan may be a strong female character, but I don't believe with Disney marketing her as a princess. Mulan appealed to some girls because she wasn't a princess. The title of Princess is really just more marketable, because Queens in Disney type movies are usually evil, while the Princess is a heroine. Still, Mulan is not a princess. For example, Mulan in the movie didn't like her kimono outfit and found it uncomfortable and it's only seen in the beginning of the film. And yet, most of the toys of her showed her in that outfit as opposed to her warrior one. For Disney to do that is kinda wrong. A lot of the hate has to do with gender roles. No matter how brave or action oriented or tomboyish princesses are, they still dress in pretty clothes and have beautiful hair and fall in love which isn't realism to the source material. The main musical theme ""Reflections"" is well written and expresses Mulan's feelings and desires with emotion. Even though it's like the other princess songs, it's still a great song. 'A girl worth fighting for' is just as good, but my favorite is 'Be a man'. Most badass song in Disney history. How come only guys can have no singing ability whatsoever but still make an awesome song? Was it really necessary for Shang to be shirtless for the entire duration of that song? Shang clearly had a thing for Mulan even during the time he didn't know she was indeed a she. Conclusion, Shang must be at least bi. Disney, you astonished me again. Want to know something interesting though, the voice actor for Captain Li Shang, was B.D. Wong, an actually an openly gay man in real life. So it was a bit odd in a while. The confusing gender roles jokes and visual gags closely border on PG, but it was funny. Another person who was funny was Eddie Murphy as Mushu, the Chinese Dragon. He did OK in the role, but couldn't they find a Chinese or Asian American comedian, that would fit the film, more. I don't mind the fact that the Chinese culture is underplayed. Speaking as an Asian, it's refreshing to see a work of media that takes place in an Asian setting without overplaying the stereotypes to the point of offensiveness. The film was generally well received by Chinese audiences. The fact that Jackie Chan put his pipes to work as the voice of the captain for the Mandarin dub didn't hurt either. The animation was breathtaking in some scenes, but others were missing the epic sheer artistry. All in all the film itself doesn't really do any harm to the source material or the culture it seeks to portray. I really liked that about it and continue to consider it one of Disney's better animated films of recent memory."
"patrick_dunne","8","5","6","30 December 2005"," How animated films should be
","I must say, Mulan is a truly wonderful film. It used to be one of my favorites as a kid.<br/><br/>It deals with ancient China, where only men could join the army. To fight the invading Hans, the government recruits men to join the army to fight the invaders. This affects Mulan's small family. Mulan is reluctant to have her father fight in the war, because she knows he could easily die, so she steals his armor and sword and sets off to join the army as a man. She later gets a companion named Mushu (voices by Eddie Murphy) who is a miniature and funny dragon sent by the ancestors. And so our story begins.<br/><br/>I really loved this movie. First of all, he story deals with a semi-sexist community, and one of the people who are considered lower, stands out from the rest. I found this to be very dramatic, and it reminds me of other movies, such as Rabbit-Proof Fence, where the despised half-castes run away from the cruel camp. This is a similar situation.<br/><br/>Second of all, the film is very funny. Eddie Murphy shows off his comedic talents when playing the role of Mushu. It's rather silly at times, but it doesn't hurt to laugh. I thought one of the funniest scenes was the bath scene, but it was pretty gross though.<br/><br/>Third of all, the animation is superbly detailed. The characters do look a bit funny, but the artists defiantly took their time in making this wonderful film.<br/><br/>Mulan is very powerful, very detailed and very funny- just like all animated films should be. I don't know why this isn't in the top 50 animated films. It's wonderful.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"Aerie-2","10","5","6","28 February 1999"," A True Masterpiece
","Every Disney movie is always advertised as ""a masterpiece"", but Mulan is one of the few that REALLY fit the bill.  The animation itself is simple and flowing, reminiscent of ancient Chinese art.  But the animation for this is really something else.  In fact, this is the best thing since The Lion King.<br/><br/>Mulan is a young girl who does her best to bring honor to her family.  Then, when the Hun army invades China, one man from every household must serve in the Imperial Army.  Since Mulan has no older brothers, her crippled father must serve.  And it's obvious, early on in the movie, that it's impossible for him to fight with a crippled leg.  There's a great likelihood that this man is going to die in battle.<br/><br/>So, out of the sheer love for her father, Mulan disguises herself in his armor and takes his place in the army.<br/><br/>This movie isn't about some gal going off to war to prove herself, or break free from the caste system, like so many other Disney heroines.  And it isn't about ""finding your prince and living happily ever after"".  Mulan goes for the simple love of her father and because of the her dedication to her family.  She risks losing everything to SAVE everything.<br/><br/>Mulan is a wonderful movie because the main character is realistic.  She's not perfect, she has her faults, and we all identify with her because we all try out best to please our fathers.  This is one of the few movies I watched with my dad that he really liked, and he isn't that fond of animated stuff. It's a great film.<br/><br/>And that's what makes a true masterpiece."

","I remember watching Disney's Mulan in the 1990's and I really didn't pay much attention to it. Mmm, hmm, bad move, I reckon in retrospective. But fortunately, I once had the curiosity to have a look at it recently, and it just blew my mind! Not only the landscapes were great and the Chinese landmarks really stunning, I became in love with the characters, especially Mulan, Mushu and even the squeaky Chi Fu. It's one of those movies that, once you care to watch again, you can rediscover as an rare jewel.<br/><br/>I don't know why I didn't see this before, but Mulan is a very positive role model for girls indeed. She is strong, spirited, humble, resourceful, smart and independent. She is selfless and she decides to risk her own life to protect her sick father's. That is quite a statement! Not only that, she manages to become a national hero by defeating the main villain, Shan Yu, single-handedly (well, with a bit of help from the likable tiny dragon Mushu). It's one of the few times I remember watching BOTH a female lead and a sidekick being so proactive! How cool is that! Besides, Mulan is very pretty (even when she is just a cartoon). When she had her self-doubting moments, I wished I could get into the movie and give her a hug (cheesy, I know, but I can't help finding her really cute).<br/><br/>Mushu is one hell of a good sidekick. Not only does he play a major role in the story, he has some of the best lines I've heard from a Disney movie (""Don't look at me. I ain't biting anymore buts"", ""You lied to me? And what are you, a sheep?""); he has so many good ones, I can't pick a favorite! I couldn't stop laughing. He is hilarious! Plus, he is never cheesy or over the top (perhaps Eddie Murphy has something to do with it).<br/><br/>Noteworthy is also the bad guy, Shan Yu. He is really cool and evil-looking, and menacing. He is very intimidating because he is realistically human (no superpowers, no fairy tale creature; perhaps some extra muscle and brute strength), and his cruelty is very real. It's not hard to think of a real individual who can come close to this guy in terms of power hunger and callous violence. Even with such a dark villain, the film still manages to give us quite a few comical moments. But when he is on screen, he means business, and you feel it.<br/><br/>Definitely, a new favorite for me. A beautifully-designed Asian culture (I love Asian cultures!), an endearing and timeless story, a cute and strong female lead (she also has her funny moments), a cool and intimidating bad guy, and a priceless little lizard... er, dragon sidekick. What else does this masterpiece need? 10/10 without doubt."

","I love this movie, and so does my sister. I loved the fact, they based it in China, and they got the cultural aspects of Chinese life right. Bravo, Disney! The animation, especially during the avalanche scene, was spotless(loved that epic shot of the bird flying over the huns), and the music, especially in the attack of the huns/avalanche scene and the part where everyone bows down to Mulan towards the end(a real tear-jerker as was the ""greatest honour is having you for a daughter"" part) by Jerry Goldsmith was lovely too, Shan-Yu's theme was also haunting. The songs are better than they're given credit for, the best being ""Reflection"", ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" and the one in the end credits. I strongly recommend Vanessa Mae's rendition of ""Reflection"", which is extraordinary. The singing voices, from the likes of Lea Salonga and Donny Osmond, did match the voice actors, unlike Quest for Camelot. The characters are also very memorable; Ming Na's feisty Mulan(one of Disney's greatest female characters), George Takei's brooding ancestor, Eddie Murphy's hilarious Mushu- who bags most of the film's best lines-, BD Wong's handsome Shang, Miguel Ferrer's mysterious and often frightening Shan Yu(who actually is an effective and underrated villain despite having an all-too-easy and lame death scene) and of course Pat Morita's wise Emperor. Some aspects of the well-told story might fly over children's heads, but this is enthralling entertainment, that deserves a much higher rating. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","Perhaps I am not the best person to review Disney cartoons...I spend too much of my time thinking things like......Hey they seem to be wearing Tang Dynasty clothes but they are practicing ancestor worship which was not introduced until the birth of the Neo-Confucian religion in the Song Dynasty.<br/><br/>However Chinese stories have always gone through a process of growth and change, with elements added and removed by different story tellers and at different times.<br/><br/>Disney's Mulan tells the historic/legendary story of Hua Mu Lan, a character popular with Chinese woman. <br/><br/>The historical innacurracies are really just a Disney Uber-China where the core elements of Chinese history are fused for the purposes of story telling. <br/><br/>I avoided seeing this movie for a long time because of the feeling that it would be racist. In many ways it was. Firstly it projects a western view that Asian women are meant to be stupid and compliant, when in fact Asian women are meant to be intelligent, well read, educated and capable and Chinese literature often admires these women. However the world's of women and men are meant to separate. The idea of women being brainless is a Western culture value projected onto Asia. The idea of women not being determined or strong is also a western culture value.<br/><br/>The other problem is the portrayal of the Huns as yellow eyed inhuman creatures or demons. <br/><br/>But the is the world of Disney. The good guys are good and the bad guys bad. The values of families sticking together, good beating evil, try your best etc are the 1950s American values that have lived on at Disney.<br/><br/>However it is an enjoyable story, and I watch it in China, in Inner Mongolia (Mongolians being from the same region as the Huns), with Chinese and Mongolians....and well they weren't offended....<br/><br/>and it is a lovely story, funny, sad, serious, with a lot of beautiful shots, heroic battles, clever dialog in the Disney fashion.

"LVJeff","10","5","7","3 August 2000"," Coming from a Chinese POV
","While most critics went into this movie expecting another typical Disney animated flick, I went in with another interest in mind: to see if Disney would give a respectable treatment to a Chinese subject.  Asian culture and their stories get limited enough time as it is in the theaters, so, being of Chinese blood, movies like Mulan are something for me to look forward to as a moviegoer.<br/><br/>I am happy to say that I was delighted by what I saw.  On the surface was, expectedly, a rather typical Disney treatment of the alienated heroine who fights for acceptance.  However, it was framed within an uncompromising traditionalist Asian mentality, and I found it quite satisfying to see Disney pull few punches as far as this mentality was concerned: that women are inferior.  They are worthless, secondary, and there only to support men. A Disney be-yourself story is perfect against this backdrop, and it was great to see the backdrop itself so relentlessly illustrated.<br/><br/>A normally watered down story might have featured a heroine set back by her own naturally limited abilities (such as Ariel's being a mermaid not allowing her to walk on land), but Mulan was stuck in a world where prejudices against whom she inherently was were not only unchecked but accepted as fact.  As someone who has been repeatedly irked by the ridiculous traditional Asian/Chinese view that women are inferior, Mulan's presentation enthralled me as the perfect situation to triumph out of. Everything in the movie reinforced this.  Mulan is to be presented like a piece of fruit to get married; she can not join the army under penalty of death; women are repeatedly referred to as not being able to do a man's job; etc.  Even the songs were extremely well-written to reinforce this: ""Be a Man"" straightforwardly suggests that only a man is capable of being strong enough to go to war; ""A Girl Worth Fighting For"" has the troops objectifying women to what they look like and cook like; ""Honor to Us All"" has a great line: ""We all must serve our emperor... our boys by bearing arms, our girls by bearing sons.""  Over and over again, the Asian mentality which I had witnessed so much myself firsthand was being pounded in to audience primarily made of impressionable kids!  Let me tell you, it was great!<br/><br/>It was great to see that old Chinese mentality exposed, even if it was in a colorful musical, to a young audience.  And it was great to see that mentality refuted by the story itself: that a woman could be resourceful enough to help win a war and defeat a major villain _without_ becoming a man.  I really appreciated it.  The extra touches of ""Chinese-ness"" were also appreciated: Mulan's exclaiming ""ai-ya!"", the Ancestors and their place in the family homelife, the reverence under which the Emperor was held, the wicked official (ancient Chinese history is full of them).  One of my friends saw this in a theater full of Asians, and he said the audience received the movie with cheerful enthusiasm.  Even my parents appreciated the effort put into the movie, with my mother, self-proclaimed cartoon-hater, giving it a thumbs up!<br/><br/>This movie did not go to lengths to misunderstand and poke fun at the Chinese.  It really did a fine job getting the point just right, especially in the conveyed attitude toward women.  Thus it scores on two levels: it shows that the Chinese can be heroic and that women are equal with men. It makes the kids happy and Asians can be in on the jokes.  I think this was a great achievement.<br/><br/>P.S. For those of you who wonder about the actual story of Mulan: the story exists as a poem.  Much of it is spent describing in detail how Mulan made herself to appear as a man, and then back as a woman after the war was over, and, so I've been told, not much else.

","Disney is probably the best known name in animation but because their films are almost never on television I don't think I'd seen one since I saw Pinocchio in the cinema in 1972 when I was five! For that reason when I saw 'Mulan' was going to be on television I just had to watch it.<br/><br/>This film tells the tale of the eponymous Mulan; a Chinese girl living with her invalid father. When China is invaded by the Huns every family must send one male to fight for the emperor; as Mulan has no brothers this means her father must go for the sake of the family's honour. Knowing that he will almost certainly be killed Mulan cuts her hair short before taking her father's armour and sneaking out of the house at night to enlist. This is a foolhardy move as it would mean instant death and dishonour should her true gender be exposed. In order to save her the family ancestors are summoned and Mushu, a small dragon goes off to help her he too wasn't meant to go but he is determined to regain his position. When Mulan gets into the army things don't go too well at first and more than once it looks as if she will be caught; eventually however she and her comrades go into battle against the dreaded Hun and due to Mulan's bravery and quick thinking they prevail. Unfortunately for her though they learn she is a girl; because of her bravery she isn't killed but she is left behind in shame. When she sees that the Hun aren't all dead she must tell her friends and save the emperor this time she won't be hiding her gender they will! <br/><br/>I was surprised how much I enjoyed this; the story was great and I really liked the protagonist, Ming-Na did a good job providing her voice. The most recognisable voice was provided my Eddie Murphy, who played the comedy sidekick Mushu; he did a good job and provided plenty of laughs from a character I initially thought might turn out to be irritating. While there are plenty of laughs there is also a good amount of drama and action; the scenes where Mulan sets off to join the army and where her unit finds the site where the rest of the army had been defeated were particularly poignant. The action scenes were quite dramatic; especially the 'avalanche scene'. Being a Disney film there were some songs and while they didn't have me humming along they did add some enjoyable moments. Being a U certificate there is nothing in this film that makes it unsuitable for young children and it is nice to see a children's film where the female protagonist doesn't need a man to rescue her from danger; here it is she who does the rescuing! Given how much I enjoyed this; I just hope it isn't another forty years till I catch another Disney animation!"
"rebecky14","9","2","2","3 April 2012"," An awesome Disney movie for so many reasons ...
","Finally, Disney has a great feminist character! Disney has created a beautifully artistic and cultural movie, with an excellent story, in the form of Mulan. <br/><br/>The story: Mulan is a young Chinese girl preparing for a life as a housewife, but she knows she's far too strong-minded to be something as menial as that. When the Huns invade China, her father (the only male in the household), is selected to fight in the army, despite the fact he has old wounds that prevent him from fighting properly. Determined to save her father, Mulan disguises herself as a man and takes his place in the army. <br/><br/>This movie has been a personal favorite of mine ever since I saw it when I was a little girl. Since I watched it, Mulan has constantly been a role model of mine: she is a girl who's brave, who will do anything for her family, a girl who dares to be different, and a girl who dares to follow her dreams, and her heart. <br/><br/>But the character of Mulan isn't the only awesome thing about this movie. The other characters are excellent and not at all one-dimensional. Eddie Murphy - who voices the tiny, jive-talking dragon Mushu - is hilarious most of the time. Shan-Yu has to be one of the best villains Disney has created in a long time. Shang is interesting, but is possibly the weakest, least-developed character of all. <br/><br/>The music is wonderful, the battle scenes are epic, the song items don't interfere with the story at all, and the detail is beautiful. My only complaint is that it could have been a bit longer. I would have liked some more development within the story and with the separate characters. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, an awesome Disney movie!<br/><br/>8/10"
"kevinxirau","10","2","2","21 December 2011"," A great movie that entertains with honor.
","This was a very interesting direction Disney went in terms of storytelling with their classic charm. Based on an actual Chinese story, Mulan is unlike anything the filmmakers of Disney ever created.<br/><br/>Mulan herself is very unique compared to most women from the Disney universe. She's no princess or pretty girl wanting more or waiting for a happy ending, instead she's a bit of a social outcast stuck in the traditional family norm the Chinese had with women at the time who just wishes to be herself and prove that she's no obedient little housewife-to-be. Mulan takes a big risk and ends up becoming the heroine China needs to save them from the crafty and ruthless Shan Yu, who leads the invading Huns.<br/><br/>All the other characters are a true delight. Mushu (Eddie Murphy), Mulan's guardian dragon, is a hilarious character who proves to quite helpful on certain occasions and brings much of the comedy into the film. Captain Shang is tough and determined, but even he has his insecurities, which makes him a unique love interest to Mulan. The villain Shan Yu is not someone to be trifled with or underestimated because he's cold, calculating, and powerful as heck. The trio (Yau, Ling, and Chien-Po) are really fun to watch as they hilariously interact with other characters such as Mulan, Chi-Fu, and even each other.<br/><br/>This movie has the perfect blend of amazing art design, epic action scenes, wonderful music that complements the various scenes, memorable songs, great comedy, intricate storytelling, flawless animation, and excellent themes. The filmmakers must have really pushed themselves to make this into an awesome and unique edition to the Disney franchise and they weren't too afraid to get a little dark and make the situations the characters are going through as real and sometimes as dangerous as possible, both the menacing Huns and their own somewhat strict social traditions.<br/><br/>Overall, this is indeed a rare flower that blooms the most beautifully. I consider this to be one of the greatest Disney films ever made, if not the best. It is highly recommended that you check this movie out and marvel at the cultural and cinematic wonder that is Mulan."
"vip_ebriega","10","2","2","7 June 2007"," One of the best animated movies ever. A ""Best Picture"" movie epic made as an animated feature.
","My Take: Yet another Disney classic. Impressively animated and beautifully told. <br/><br/>Epics have always been one of Hollywood's most regular films during the golden age of film making. Epics are done in very high budgets, and at the time, one of the most astonishing. Another powerful Hollywood genre, is animation. It was powerful as well, that it earned an award slot in the Academy Awards (""Best Animated Feature"").<br/><br/>What's great about ""Mulan"" is that it combines these to staples in Hollywood in one very satisfying movie. The film is based, as I've heard, on a poem about a typical village girl who, in favor of his father, joins the Imperial army on resent against the invading Huns. Disgused as a man named Ping, Mulan sets on an incredible journey, and finds herself changing the course of history forever. This movie interests me for the fact that it is done in great skill, as if the producers were making a live-action epic. The films moments of war matches the very moments of those on big-screen live-action epics. The score by Jerry Goldsmith, one of my favorite composers of all time, gives his best by providing the music, and of course it was great. But when Goldsmith scored this, he wasn't focusing on an animated movie score, but as if he was scoring, perhaps, a David Lean epic. <br/><br/>""Mulan"" has always been one of my favorite animated movies. Perhaps, it may just be one of the best animated movies ever. A ""Best Picture"" movie epic made as an animated feature. If David Lean were to make an epic and threw in some first-rate musical numbers in, it would have been somewhere akin to MULAN. <br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","I think that Mulan was excellent. For once, characters could roam around without frickin breaking out into song every five minutes. The one thing I hated about all the old Disney movies is that they were practically musicals. This movie probably had fewer songs than any other Disney flick at its time. And also, the songs were cute n' catchy, instead of overwhelmingly cute and sickening. I could actually watch this movie without the urge of just taking out the tape and loading it on a skeet shooter. Hahhahaha. I left this movie saying wow, I actually wouldn't mind watching it again.

","MULAN is a great movie which has many memorable characters and impressive scenes. The main character of this movie is an ancient Chinese girl who fights for her company instead of her old father, but it also has many interesting supportive characters. In particular, I like Mushu, a tiny dragon who travels with Mulan. He and two other animal characters---a cricket and a horse---make this serious story funny and enjoyable. their humor helps Mulan a lot to encounter a lot of difficulties and get over them. Mulan's brave behaviors encouraged me a lot. At the same time, Mushu's funny jokes entertained me a lot. I was moved many times and I also laughed over and over again when I saw this movie. Its music is also wonderful. In this movie, I enjoyed many grand, gentle, beautiful and pleasant scores. As a music-major student, I highly evaluate these scores.

","I saw this for the first time two nights ago, 5 years after its release in theaters. It had my heart strings being tugged, had me giggling, and, most importantly, it moved me. The music was beautiful, particularly the lyrics and music to the song that Mulan sings to herself (""Who Is This Girl I See""?). The lyrics are just as awesome an accomplishment as the melody of the song. The animation on Mulan and the Captain of the Imperial army was very lifelike. I could actually picture what the people might look like in real life. That's a first for me with a Disney animated feature. I was very impressed.<br/><br/>The only possible flaw I saw in this movie, not being an expert in East Asian culture, but knowing a little, is the way Mulan's family behaved when she returned from running away, even though they knew where she'd gone and what she'd done. I think, realistically, an East Asian family, particularly from that era, would not have behaved that way. I could be wrong."
"diamonds17","Null","2","2","17 July 2002"," Great Disney Movie with a Different Beat
","After watching Mulan at a local movie theater with my family, I have to admit, I was amazed.  I had seen previews for it on TV, and I was disappointed.  I pictured Mulan as a dark, gloomy movie about war and fighting. Honestly, it was the opposite.  With the hilariously clever Mushu and cute Cri-Kee, Mulan colorfully displayed a young girl, growing up, trying to find her way and prove she is worth something to her father and to herself.<br/><br/>Mulan is certainly not the typical, traditional Disney film...and I applaud it for that.  Focused in Ancient China, it is about a young, ordinary girl. She is not a princess (Jasmine) and she is no extraordinarily beautiful woman falling in love (Pocahontas).  She is just a young girl trying to save her father and trying to prove herself.<br/><br/>I admit to scrutinizing Mulan for not being about a princess and not being about romance, but because of that, it proves that a movie about people, ordinary people, can do well too.  Mulan came at a time when Disney movies were not as appealing as they once were (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules), but it revived the Disney scene anyway.<br/><br/>While I still say that the new classics, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King are the best films Disney has produced, with well-written storylines and amazing musical scores, Mulan is a wonder of its own.  The lack of music was disappointing, but nonetheless, Mulan is a wonderful movie for families, especially young girls and their fathers."

It is with Princess Mononoke, CTHD, Twin Warriors and Startrek TNG one of my all time favorites."
"Jeremy Bristol","7","2","2","5 June 2001"," Pretty Good (7/10), and the characters don't break into song and dance.
","Except, they do still sing--as sort of narration for their emotions.  The songs are highly unmemorable (as I sit here writing this, I can only remember the line, ""I'll make a man out of you,"" which is from the very worst song ever including in a Disney film.<br/><br/>By the way, will Disney ever have a ""training session"" that will last more than a couple minutes and that isn't put to a song?  They did that to this movie, Hercules, Tarzan (who also grew into an adult instantaneously), and Beauty and the Beast (in that Belle changes her mind about the Beast during a song).<br/><br/>One more really bad thing about Mulan--Mushu is a total hinderance.  I'm not just talking about his pop-culture mouth (which someone should have popped), but that he in fact causes more problems than he solves.  Would it really be so much to ask if Mulan could have made the mistake that ""gave away our position,"" instead of having Mushu shoot off a rocket?  At least that way, she's redeeming her own mistake, instead of someone elses, which gives no emotional payoff.  Better yet, why not have the falcon find the line of troops--after all, that's what the falcon is for, right?  It scouted earlier for the general's encampment and brought back the doll, remember?<br/><br/>Oh, and the cross-dressing thing at the end was a little too weird--a bit too Fushigi Yugi and not really very intelligent--do you honestly think that anybody would fall for that trick, even if they were really women (especially considering what the Monguls would have done).<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie were the references to Japanese cartoons (anime).  When Mushu fries the feathers off of the falcon, it looks like a Chocobo from the Final Fantasy series, but is just as likely a reference to the horseclaws from Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind (the director, apparently, is a devotee of Miyazaki).  Another Nausicaa reference--the doll, which is similar to the one that Lord Yupa finds at the beginning of the Nausicaa movie (it crumbles, and Yupa says, ""Another village has died."").  Also, Mulan's hair is given incredible attention, which is not usually the case in Disney films (usually they're just pretty and blow in the wind).  Just watch her hair when she bows in shame after they find out she's a she!<br/><br/>Beyond that, there is a good deal of emotional content, though once the possibility of execution is lifted (a life for a life), it is never mentioned again--even though the overseer, who really hated her, could have had her executed at a moments notice once she caught back up with them.  And I'm sorry, but for all their knowledge and art, the Chinese were rather steadfast about their ways and about honor--they would not suddenly become so accepting of women, especially since they are still rather unaccepting of women."

"Gris","9","2","2","25 November 1998"," Very good... maybe the Disney boost?
","This is one of the best Disney pictures from ""The Little Mermaid"". It seems that they have realised that their public is not only còmposed by children and that the animation genre does not necessarily be musical to death. With only four songs -rather good, but not as breathtaking as before- and a BEAUTIFUL score from Jerry Goldsmith, it has some important differences from the former Disney structure. There is no love story, but some real social revindication -the girl is not looking forward to finding a man to marry to and have children. The plot is well balanced showing both crude real-life scenes and good gags.<br/><br/>Maybe the Disney boost? Since ""The Lion King"", nothing really remarkable was made... Pocahontas's plot was awful, The Hunchback just killed the original story by Victor Hugo and Hercules was a bit too childish. I guess they have been seriously encouraged by their competitors 20th, Warner and Dreamworks."

Osmond and Salonga are first rate musical singers and do their part superbly. I have also heard mandarin version of ""Man out of You"" with Jackie Chan and to tell the truth I found it even better than English version. Although I do not understand the language, I felt the poise in the singing, and it was superb. So for Chan I add one extra point 11 out of 10.<br/><br/>The Huns were presented as evil as could get, yet wise, which gave depth to their characters. The battle scene in the middle of the film has very interesting and good angles in cinematography. Very well thought out.<br/><br/>The supporting characters were good. Mushu was very well created character and had some very funny lines. Usually many sidekicks are too overwritten, but Mushu, even when talking too much, had something to say as well. Murphy did great job. There were some lines even that were spine chilling (Emperor's).<br/><br/>Although the movie was very well paced and intelligently created, it was not perfect. And simply because it tried to be too commercial. If some cheap jokes were omitted, it could have been great.<br/><br/>Overall I give 9 out of 10 and highly recommend for everybody.

I am certainly one of the people that enjoyed Mulan to a fuller extent than those who still thought it was great, because I think it is near perfect. The first time I watched Mulan I was simply overwhelmed by how much I fell in love with the heartwarming story, strong character of Mulan and the musical numbers. I still remember the place and time, and how I felt.<br/><br/>Of course, what is to be expected of Walt Disney animations? Most all of them offer some form of entertainment or positive influence on the viewers and have now for ages. The Disney renaissance was well needed and brought along a handful of lovable new installments. Mulan is just a film that I got carried away from beginning to end. My favorite scenes are the Match Maker, river and climax scenes. I also find the quote, ""The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all,"" to be one of my many favorite quotes that are out there.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you were let down by Mulan, I strongly suggest giving it one more go. I teared up, chuckled and smiled through most of the movie and it was because it is an extremely well done animation that is probably my favorite of the Walt Disney classics and masterpieces line or even animation film in general. I really do love it that much."
"Spleen","9","4","6","1 July 1999"," Truly great except for ONE thing ...
","The depth of talent at Disney is frightening.  It's interesting the character animation here with that in ""The Prince of Egypt"" - no contest at all.  Every character in ""Mulan"" is well, brilliantly, perfectly animated, and many great animators at Disney didn't even touch the project.  A writer here who said that the animation ""lacks detail"" merely betrays his (her?) ignorance.  One must distinguish between character design and animation: the former is what a still drawing of a character displays, the latter is the art of moving a character around.  The animation was full of detail.  I felt that every one of the 24-per-second frames conveyed something of value. The character design, on the other hand, *was* deliberately simplified, but I don't see how anyone could deny that this approach was both beautiful and fitting; and since everything (backgrounds and effects animation) had the same stylistic simplicity, the characters were more solidly in place than they usually are in animation.<br/><br/>(The effects animation was creative and also streets ahead of ""The Prince of Egypt"".  As was the use of computers.  Watch the Great Wall scene closely: you might be able to *deduce* that computers were involved, but you certainly won't feel that they were.  Computer imagery has been misused with ghastly results in everything from ""Aladdin"" to ""The Phantom Menace"". Finally someone has it right.)<br/><br/>I won't comment on the story - I'm still moved by it, but then I'm a sucker for that kind of thing.  I'll get to my one complaint.  It's not the music. Yes, the music was ultra-1980s with the odd pentatonic scale; but that's not intrinsically worse than being ultra-1990s with the odd pentatonic scale, and it has the advantage that we know immediately the worst about how dated it will sound (less dated than you'd expect).  No: my problem is Eddie Murphy.  He is painfully unfunny and his introduction made me sigh wearily. He doesn't belong here.  I don't have anything against comic relief, but Disney should have trusted their animators to provide it.  When Mushu is funny, it's the animators' doing - and on those occasions the humour is not at odds with the story.<br/><br/>That one criticism pains me to make.  Swallowing ""Mulan"" whole, Eddie Murphy and all, it's still a fine movie and a reason for optimism about the future of hand-drawn animation."

Good score from Jerry Goldsmith. The animation is solid and occasionally impressive. The cultural diversity helps greatly as the story is predictable to a fault.

Even with that it's still a beautiful movie.  <br/><br/>I appreciate the cultural themes which weren't downplayed but brought to light a culture that has endured long because of it's simplicity and deep values. The invocations/prayers to the ancestors, the burning of incense in their shrine, the calling forth of the guardians, the immobile face of the Emperor before the Hun leader(though he was at death's door)honor above all.  The dialogue and one liners were actually dramatic and memorable in these scenes.  <br/><br/>""Though the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow before it"" ""A girl like that does not happen every dynasty""<br/><br/>But the music really brought this  picture alive; I'll make a man out of you is one of my favourites soundtracks ranking second to Let The River Run (Working Girl OST).

","This is by no means an average Disney effort but like I said,an average Disney still rates as an all time classic.Nobody can beat them in the family/animation genres.What makes this one average as opposed to it having been one of the best was the fact that I found the animations a little rough.They could have made more spectacular background effects.They had ancient China for scenery and that would give them leeway for much more spectacular scenery.I wanted more attention to detail in this area given the animation technology available today.Also,they could have made Mulan a little more stronger looking.More of a stronger look and personality could be done for women without compromising their female qualities.There are many amazon/warrior type gorgeous women and a lot  of them,contrary to stereotipical beliefs,are Asian too.How many chances does Disney have to focus a movie on east Asia.They should have been more responsible wih their portrayal of scenery and people of this great land in this regard.But other than this point,and given how many other things could have gone wrong,Disney once again did a bravo job.Not shying away from exotic cultures and taking on women's rights issues are very commendable and really educate the world's children.The little dragon stole the show too and I was laughing so hard!I forgive the producers regarding the music becouse good musical compositions are very very difficult to come by and you do not just create top quality music any time you want.Great music is very precious and people must realise this fact.So we must appreciate what ever great music we got from this movie(like ""Reflection"").Creatng great music is very spur of the moment and pops up unpredictably.Ask pro composers and they will tell you.But other aspects like visual animation can very much be controlled big time.Particularly now when hand drawn art is backed up by computer animation technologies.Peace out......"
"Cutter John","Null","2","3","20 September 1999"," Disney gets a little provocative.
","This is one of the best Disney films of the last several years.  Although it does mostly conform to recent Disney formula with the goofy little sidekick, beautiful hero and heroine, evil nemesis, and use of magic, it is unique in several ways.  First off, this is not a musical per se.  I believe there are only 3 or 4 songs and none in the second half, so we are given more opportunity to enjoy the characters and story.  Mulan is not all that original a character, yet her historic magnitude and awkward charm make her more interesting than most of her predecessors.  The intensity of the narrative is also more compelling than most of the vain and selfish interests of previous Disney tales (e.g. Arial's and the Beast's desire to be human, or Jasmine's and Quasi's want for a sensitive mate.)  This tale is true selfless heroics; defending one's nation from apparent Juggernauts. Although the Huns lack the colorful persona's of their predecessors, they are terrifying antagonists more in the vein of Warner Brothers *The Secret of Nymh* and *Anastasia* rather than Disney.  The artwork is quite daring, in that the animators tone-down the overwhelming colors and spectacular backdrops we are used to, and go for more bleak and austere landscapes, foreboding settings, and compelling virtual camera angles and framing, all of which enhance rather than distract us from the film's focus."

"quiqueperezsoler","9","1","1","26 April 2020"," Timeless, Empowering and Touching. Proof that when animation is done right and with care it becomes a fan favorite and classic.
","The 90s were known as ""Disney's Renaissance"" where many titles reached critically and commercial success, some of them even breaking records like Mulan(1998). It is not an exaggeration to say that Mulan(1998) is one of the most original, well-crafted and aesthetically innovative animated feature in Disney's repertoire.<br/><br/>From the mesmerizing chinese painting-style opening titles to the stunning animation and sharp character designs, the film holds an aesthetically pleasing style and feel very different to what Disney used to do back then and which stand the test of time. Contrary to computer animation, it's hard for traditional animation to become outdated and it will still resonate the same to newer generations as long as it's done right. That's why the moral and themes of the story must be significant in order for it to have a chance to still be relevant in the future.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in both aspects, it provides an endearing, touching and well-realised story loosely based in the famous Chinese legend of Mulan; and a riveting emotive and action-filled spectacle with an incredibly well-composed soundtrack and an empowering message for women. The movie has some elements that could have potentially ruined the tone and craftmanship of the tale being told like the character of Mushu. However, thanks to the well-written jokes, impeccable performance by Eddie Murphy and overall relevance to the plot it provides a funny support character meant to help the main lead to express her thoughts at certain crucial parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Disney has been known to add common elements to every Princess tale making it a bit formulaic, elements like animal side characters or mascots and a romantic interest. While these are merely irrelevant to the story and mostly add comical moments to it, in this film all the side characters have a reason to be there and have a role within the story. Except perhaps the dog, which only appears in one sequence at the beginning of the movie and it's never seen again.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the first 20 minutes are some of the most intense, well fleshed out and heartfelt moments of any animated feature. With little dialogue and the abundance of symbolisms, songs and wise metaphors, the first act of the movie is able to convey to the audience precisely how Mulan feels towards the situation she is living and the overall picture of women in this portrayal of feudal China.<br/><br/>While some views and commentaries found in songs may have aged poorly, the film contains uplifting and encouraging calls to action motivated by honor and identity. THere's a sense of comradery as the training the soldiers go through provide a needed bonding that would benefit them not only in defeating the enemy but also would help them open their eyes and heart.<br/><br/>Another very important aspect the movie stands out for is the uncensoring of the more tragic and darker moments involving the enemy and the consequences of war without ever taking it too far.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, as a take of a very loosely based portrayal of the legend of Mulan the movie doesn't succeed as much, but as a story of a daughter that went to war instead of her wounded father to not only save his life but prove her worth and find her self and eventually suceeding in doing so bringing honor to her family it's a remarkable movie. Great animation, original setting, inspiring scenes and symbolism, soothing and energetic music and incredible themes. This film does everything an animated movie can do and it does it perfectly."

","Since I recently saw this movie again during a seminars day at my school, and since I was unsatisfied with my first review of this movie, I have decided to rewrite it. It was a slow Halloween despite a costume-con in my school's atrium, but conveniently it quieted down as this movie began. So why is this movie better than I initially remembered it?<br/><br/>The story, admittedly, does utilize some clichÃ©s (especially in its twists), but its structure is very solid overall. It flows affably and delivers on the humor, courtesy of its voice acting (I loved Miguel Ferrer's portrayal of Shan Yu) and the way it wrote its comic reliefs. Not only do these reliefs provide some good chuckles, but Mushu in particular is important to the plot due to his fire breathing and mentoring of Mulan. For our characters, we have the titular Mulan as the woman who wants to deliver more than what is expected of her by any means necessary, Li Shang as her tough yet fair CO, and Shan Yu as a genuinely threatening and bad@$$ villain with, again, an intimidating and all-around awesome voice. Most other characters outside of the Fa family, the Emperor, and Chi Fu are either summed up in tropes (Mulan's trio of friends) or just not important to the main story. Our main characters are memorable and complex, just as we expect from a Disney movie. Even 20 years later, the animation still resonates with its depiction of ancient China, its moderately thrilling action, its appealing character designs, its commitment to the humor, and its enhancement of the songs. It's smooth and perfectly fluid to give the human characters realism, and does enough with its effects and stylization of the animal characters to make them believable in their world. The songs are forgettable in comparison to other Disney songs of the period, but they are very fun to listen to, don't interrupt the plot flow, and make the montages easy to remember, more so than the songs themselves.<br/><br/>Mulan, at least for me, comes off as one of the few Disney movies where one more easily understands it if they view it as they grow older. Young children may remember the songs, Mushu's jokes, some sight gags, and the action, while older children may point out that Mulan is a solid role model. As such, if your family has children of various ages, this would be a safe bet for movie nights. It is a worthwhile addition to Disney collections, even if VP Pence doesn't think highly of it."

"localdudet","8","1","1","17 October 2017"," A Fire Female
","The famous movie of historical Asian history, Mulan, directed by Tony Bancroft, is a movie of a woman named Mulan taking the place of her father in war. Being a woman automatically disqualifies her as a soldier, and throughout the movie it is obvious that women are not looked at the same way that men are. Mulan's plot demotes women but its protagonist rejects this assumption to conclude that women can do whatever a man is able. In the beginning of the movie, Mulan, the main character, is continuously put down because of her female being. The movie begins with Mulan practicing to impress a match maker that will match her with her future husband. When her professional stylist is getting her ready for the big event; the stylist implies that Mulan is a sexual object. Throughout their song the stylist says, ""Boys will go to war for you if you're pretty, obedient, and have a tiny waist. You should demonstrate dignity, be poised and be silent."" The stylist is implying that the only way a woman should be appealing is by obtaining these qualities. Personally, being a woman myself, this portrait of woman-expectancy that reveals the sexism that is present in this movie, makes me question what young boys take away from this particular section of this movie. To add on, when Mulan steps up to go into war for her father, she is still looked down on for doing the impossible. Her ancestors say, ""Mulan's father, forever shall be shamed because a woman is taking her place in war."" Mulan is willingly taking the place of her injured father. This act is noble if a man were to do it; however, this movie suggests that it is shameful for a woman to perform the same honorable act. When Mulan is preparing to face the other soldiers, her male horse laughs in her face for trying to act as male. Animals are treated as less than humans and the way that the horse demotes Mulan portrays women as being even less than an animal; proving the sexism further. In the song that plays when the men are getting ready for war, Li Shang, the captain of the troops, says ""Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?"" Li Shang is downgrading women without realizing that Mulan is in his presence. A great amount of sexism goes on throughout the plot of this movie coming in the form of humans and even animals. Even though Mulan faces an enormous amount of unbelievable sexism, she proves that she can do whatever a man is able to do. When going through training, she comes in last and lags behind the other soldiers. However, as time goes on, she trains hard enough to become first in the races and training practices. Also, when in battle, Mulan is first in line with all the men behind her. She selflessly goes head first into the opposing army's soldiers in order to swiftly beat them in battle. Mulan uses logical alternatives to excel farther than the men in her troops and on the opposing army. Though, scientifically, Mulan is not physically matched to the male soldiers, she substitutes her smart antics to fly high. Mulan's plot degrades women, however the main character changes this thought, helping women to realize that they can match anything that a man is capable of. I think that this movie begins with a large amount of demotion towards women but there is a satisfying ending to this assumption. Mulan proves that women are capable of more than being a trophy wife, and this is proved every day in the twenty first century. Women are CEOs and military lieutenants, which manifests their ultimate capability. Women are powerful and can do anything that they put their mind to. And if every woman realized this, sexism would not exist."
"lee_eisenberg","6","1","1","4 October 2017"," I'm China tell you something
","The story of Hua Mulan is probably not that well known outside China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, so most of the world will very likely only know Disney's adaptation. The title character is admirable enough, refusing to conform to traditional gender roles. My favorite character was Mushu, given an over-the-top personality by Eddie Murphy.<br/><br/>Around the time that it got released, I remember reading about people of Asian descent who were unhappy with some of the depictions in ""Mulan"". I suspect that every movie has something that can come across as insensitive. Overall, the movie is enjoyable enough. As usual, I didn't pay much attention to the songs, instead concentrating on the action.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast includes B. D. Wong (Dr. Wu in ""Jurassic Park""), June Foray (voice of Rocky the Squirrel) and George Takei (indelible as Sulu on ""Star Trek"", he later wrote a Broadway musical about the internment of the Japanese people in the US during WWII)."
"Vimacone","8","1","1","12 August 2017"," Disney's Greatest Heroine
","I've considered Mulan (and Tarzan) to be the last great animated Disney features to be produced. <br/><br/>A lot of comparison has been made between Mulan and Pocahontas in that most fans and critics consider Mulan to be a better film. While I do think Pocahontas is a great film, I do agree with that sentiment. Both films feature a strong and admirable heroine that break the mold of what their respective societies expect them to adhere to. Mulan is more successful in portraying the theme of breaking the gender roles. And Disney didn't whitewash the historical realities of how women were treated in Ancient China, which conveyed the theme so much stronger. Another aspect that makes Mulan a much more enjoyable film are the songs. Virtually every song (even the deleted songs) are very catchy and memorable.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are also very memorable. Eddie Murphy seems like a curious choice for Mushu, but it works so well. Chein Po, Ling, and Yao bring comic relief to the trials of basic training and also to the dramatic war scenes. Disney had gone back to the appealing cartoony designs, reminiscent of their golden age animated features, at the start of the renaissance. However, like their films of the 1950's, they moved toward realistic designs for the human characters starting with Pocahontas. I believe this was a factor as to why Pocahontas was not as successful as say Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin, because the drawing style lacked that Disney charm. In Mulan, only the comic relief characters (i.e Chein Po, Ling, and Yao) are drawn with that exaggerated cartoony look.<br/><br/>Speaking of gender roles, this is a Disney film, billed as a ""Princess"" film in later years, that can be enjoyed by both genders. In theory girls can appreciate the theme of hardship and pressure she goes through to fit the criteria of becoming an ideal woman and bride, while boys can enjoy the thrilling war scenes that are so brilliantly executed. But, both boys and girls alike can admire Mulan for her feat of twice taking down an entire army (almost single handed) that threatens her country."
"Animany94","9","1","1","6 August 2017"," At points underrated.
","When I still watch Disney animated movies, it is because I think there is more to them than just great animation and family entertainment. Mulan has shown me that real life issues can be handled in a way so we can translate those problems into a visual delivery. Therefore I will highlight some points for which Mulan should get more recognition.<br/><br/>Mulan shows us the generally male dominated culture we live in (the Chinese setting is secondary). Mulan is a good role model for young girls, because she acts instead of just being pretty and waiting for her prince to save her (Snow White and Sleeping Beauty for example). <br/><br/>The horrors of war is also visually shown when Li Shang and his army finds the dead bodies of his father and the other soldiers. It is a brilliant scene which seldom is mentioned in various ""scariest Disney moments""-countdowns. <br/><br/>Those are the messages I feel are underrated. Now for some quick technical aspects I see as great. The Hun army's run down the mountain side is incredible, when the crowd in front of the emperor's palace bows is also great and the scene in which the Chinese army finishes the song ""A Girl Worth Fighting for"" and discovers the burned down village. <br/><br/>However, I would have liked to see more of the terror of the Huns. Shan Yu was not that memorable (I still find him scary, though)."

","Disney did it again. With the right blend of humor, romance, action, and most of all, emotion. Watching this now is quite the different experience than when I first saw it as a child. I understand more fully the cultural and familial obstacles presented against Mulan. I noticed some things that I didn't catch the first viewing. Again, Mulan is a tale of identity, about trying to find out and discover who you are. Like Hercules, The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Frozen, you name it, Disney is all about identity and rising against the norm and what society expects of you. Obviously, as it's a Western commercial production, it makes many cross-cultural flaws -- the characters have too-exaggerated facial features to supposed to look Chinese, for instance.<br/><br/>It being Disney, its soundtrack is amazing, we all know ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" and ""Reflection,"" just to name two. It has a great voice acting cast (i.e. Eddie Murphy as Mushu), and it ends very happily for all the good guys. Some things are a little rushed, I thought, towards the end concerning certain characters but still, Mulan is a film you need to see, no matter what your age. It will impel you to strike forth against the societal construct we know as ""normal,"" that is, to be like everybody else. Who gives a damn about what other people think? You only have one life. Make the most of it, carpe diem.<br/><br/>Everything taken into account, Mulan I'd say surpasses Hercules, but lies below The Lion King.

","Although Mulan seems to be nonsensical when she cuts her hair off and joins the army pretending to be a man, she demonstrates courage and bravery by taking her elderly father's place to defend China against the treacherous Huns. When the Huns climb the wall built to keep them out and kill all the guards present, the horror that China is about to face becomes evident. Why the Huns want to seize China is unknown, but they are on their way to the capital to do so. Like many third world countries, China requires that one man from every family enlist to strengthen their numbers. Of course to propel the movie, Mulan's family does not have any young boys, so her father is forced to join. Concerned for her father who is elderly, Mulan begs the recruiters to pardon him from enlisting because she knows that in his old age he will die training for and fighting the war. Her father, however, is disgraced by Mulan's begging because he feels it is his duty to defend his country. He is honored to fight and die for China. Of course, Mulan plays the hero. Determined to keep her father out of the war and uphold her family's honor, she chops off her hair and enlists."

","We all have heard of many different Disney princesses. However, this one probably takes the cake. First of all, she is Asian (hooray for Disney being more culturally diverse) and she is like many women who just are not the type who adore being girly and feminine. This story follows Mulan, a girl in ancient China who is having a hard time blossoming into a so called 'woman'. China is freshly at war, and hence are recruiting a man from every single family to fight it. As Mulan's father is old and sick and there are no other males in her family, she decides to take the risk, dress up as a man and take his place. This is one of the first Disney films that addresses gender roles, and how they do not necessarily need to be followed to be a good man or woman. The movie is directed in a light-hearten fashion, with quite a bit of comedy and a lot less romance. It also is a story of personal development, and how rough experiences can teach you things you would never imagine. Great for anyone, even if you are not a fan of Disney!"
"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","24 November 2015"," Fantastic, thrilling adventure with a great message for kids
","Fa Mulan is by far my favourite Disney protagonist. If we're simply talking about Disney heroines, that might be Jasmine from Aladdin or Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but Mulan is far more than a simple heroine. She's the hero of her story. She is the one that causes things to happen. Sure, there have been lots of female protagonists before her, but in their case it was always the case of things happening to them and them reacting to it. Mulan's story is entirely her own doing. She didn't need to go to war for her dad. She chose to, despite all the problems it would bring her. It's a small distinction, but an important one.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's an amazing film even without our badass name-taking, sword-swinging, Hun-defeating, pole-climbing, ancient-bazooka-wielding hero. After a couple of rather flawed Renaissance films, it returns to form with all aspects of the film working beautifully together and with no discernible faults. Sure, some people claim that Shan Yu, the villain, is a tad boring and one-dimensional. And yeah, I can see where they're coming from, but personally I like him. He's menacing and unstoppable, with an intellect to match. He attacks China because it's there, no other reason needed. Having him singing villain songs would water him down.<br/><br/>Then there's of course Mushu, the dragon guardian, voiced by Eddie Murphy. And yeah, that is an odd, odd casting choice, which I'm not one hundred percent convinced works. Sure, he is the best source of comedy in the film by far and it's very good comedy. One of Murphy's best roles, in fact. But he is also pretty distracting from time to time, keeping us from fully immersing ourselves. It doesn't really ruin the film, and I'm not convinced that a more traditional voice would have worked any better either, but it is a thing to ponder about.<br/><br/>The songs are also great, though perhaps not Disney's best effort either. Though, keeping in mind that this is Disney, that's a pretty high bar to reach, so you cannot really fault the movie for failing. And they are good songs, with I'll Make a Man Out of You being a contender for that elusive best effort status.<br/><br/>I love that this movie exists. That Fa Mulan as a character exists. That there is a movie that uncompromisingly tells us an adventure story with a female hero, in this age where we still cannot get any movies with female leads, unless they're romantic comedies or dramas about the difficulties of love. That's thankfully slowly changing and this movie will be remembered as an important milestone on that journey."

To match the visuals is the animation which is well done I always enjoy hand drawn animation it really gives you respect for the art work in this film plus how the artist study the landscape of China.<br/><br/>The voice acting is very good and there is a lot of passion in the cast performances. The music is just superb which helps to tell the story. And of course we have the songs the best song to me is ""I'll make a man out of you"".<br/><br/>The film had some moments that could have been do without but still Mulan does offer a lot of good to outweigh the bad<br/><br/>Overall Mulan is just a enjoyable movie with a strong female hero.With strong animation very good voice work and amazing visuals this would be the film for you.<br/><br/>I give Mulan a 7 out of 10"

","Mulan is a heart warming story of a young women finding herself, as she goes on a selfless journey to protect her father from getting killed, however doing this she puts her own life in danger. Through the course of the movie Mulan is fighting a formidable foe and against stereotype, if anyone say through her disguise she could be killed on the spot, as women weren't aloud to do this in ancient china. The humor in this Disney movie appeals to all ages, throughout the movie you find yourself laughing, part of this is due to Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy. <br/><br/>Additionally, this movie begins with Mulan going to a matchmaker to become married, however when the matchmaker declares that Mulan has brought dishonor on her family tensions run high. Meanwhile, Shan Yu, is going to attack China, the emperor orders that all men fight in the war, unfortunately Mulan is an only child, her dad has already fought in a previous war and is injured. That night Mulan runs away, her family is worried as they know if anyone finds out she is a women she will be killed. In the end Mulan saves China and falls in love. Mulan is a marvelous movie that everyone should experience. Children of all ages can learn from Mulan's selflessness and bravery. The movie can teach all how being different is acceptable and everyone has their own purpose."

","Coming out at the end of the Disney renaissance and after a small string of films with a more mixed reception, Mulan can be seen as the film that called back to the earlier films of this period. It took a simple yet interesting premise and gave it plenty of emotional heft as well as comedy in an attempt to reconnect with a general audience. For the most part it is successful in achieving what its original aim with even a little extra added because of its more cultural and historical basis. Though it is by no means amongst Disney's strongest works, it is a very well made and frequently enjoyable piece.<br/><br/>The story of Mulan is loosely based on the Chinese legend of the same name. It sees the Huns invade ancient China and the man of every house must join the army. Because Mulan's father is too ill to fight she takes his place and must impersonate a man or face the death penalty if found out. This is a very good premise and an area Disney has only really touched on before, with the themes of fighting for your country and war. It gives us something Disney enjoy which is a main character fighting against adversity and here it's in more ways than one. It also successfully walks the fine line between seriousness and comedic, balancing both out effectively within the story.<br/><br/>Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) isn't that interesting yet she is meant to be a normal person thrown into a crazy situation and for that she's just fine, she is likable and does get plenty of comedic moments. The army men, including the likes of Yao and Ling, are amongst the best things here. They all have distinct personalities and provide a number of laughs, whenever they're on screen its always funny. Li Shang is just okay and doesn't have much development, but he is heroic and easy to route for on the whole. Chi-Fu is a good snobbish character and James Hong is always enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of Mulan's dragon aid Mushu and think his more self-aware comedic stylings don't fit the film at all, Eddie Murphy provides a lot of energy but it just doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>The animation is really impressive. It is very smooth and scenic for the most part, while managing to get across the beauty of China. When I think of the film I think of a lot of wilderness and mountains which always look picturesque throughout. The scenes showing the vast army of the Huns are very striking too. It also perfectly lent itself to the comic scenes and allowed for some amusing slapstick. The situation comedy is a highlight. Mulan's interactions with her fellow troops are usually hilarious and the comedy flows very naturally as a result, most of it is timeless slapstick or smart wordplay as she tries to hide her identity and fit in. The action scenes are good too. There is a genuine tension to the battle scenes and the film manages to convey just how big they are.<br/><br/>It isn't all without issue however. Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) is such a dull villain. Apart from an intimidating design there is absolutely nothing of note about him. I can't recall a line of his dialogue or any actions of his. He shows up to fight and that's effectively it, he has next to no development. The music isn't that good either. None of the songs featured where memorable and most of them didn't really fit the scenes that they were playing over. Jerry Goldsmith's score is serviceable, but again it's just a touch forgettable overall. We don't get as much of a look at the Chinese culture as I'd have liked either, but then that isn't really the films focus. <br/><br/>Mulan is another very entertaining Disney film. It doesn't go as serious with the story as it could have done or try anything new with it, but what it does do it does very well. The animation is excellent, the story is something a bit different and the situational comedy was a lot of fun. Of course some characters are a bit unbalanced, the villain is extremely weak and the songs are forgettable. Yet none of these issues truly harm the rest of the enough to damage it as a whole. It is nearly always engaging and delivers more than enough amusement throughout."
"lesleyharris30","8","1","1","18 September 2015"," A Delight for all Disney fans,
","Mulan is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic voice cast. It's a very sweet, beautifully animated film that will surely please all Disney fans, it stands as a classic animated film in the same vein as Aladdin and The Lion King does, it also has some unforgettable songs that you will find yourself humming long after you've watched the movie, such as Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You. The only thing I think this movie is missing is a strong factor of Disney animation films, comic relief, I know that Mushu is a fantastic character and brilliantly voiced by Eddie Murphy, but he dosen't have as much scenes as he should have to lighten the tone of the film, it takes itself too seriously at times and it's story can be very heavy for a younger audience, but we have to hand it to Disney for taking a huge risk on openly dealing with war. The film, unlike most of Disney's animated movies, is quite intense, it will keep you at the edge of your seat a lot, and once we get deep in to battle, it becomes very hard to believe that an animation is making you feel so much excitement, with a very powerful story. Beautifully animated with stunning music, I would recommend Mulan to anyone looking for a good family film. <br/><br/>A young lady takes her fathers place in the army by disguising herself as a man."

","Mulan (1998): Dir: Barry Cook, Tony Bancroft / Voices: Ming Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, B.D. Wong, Harvey Fierstein, Miguel Ferrer: Glorious and enchanting animation regarding the war on China in which one male from every household must venture. Mulan is a teenage girl discouraged of past failures. Her father is not well enough to fight so she cuts her hair and sets out in the night while her parents are asleep. Well placed humour takes affect as she attempts to act manly during training. While plot is typical, structure is formula but its ending bares the message. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft with beautiful animated appeal that will appeal to family audiences although it isn't as broad as the best of Disney animations. Ming Na Wen voices Mulan who undertakes a massive task. It is obvious that she will be the hero she never was and that her family will be honored, etc. Eddie Murphy steals scenes as Mulan's dragon guardian who is not exactly what he appears. Murphy steals every scene as the voice of this little red creature. Other voice talents accompany very flat personalities. B.D. Wong voices the commander whom Mulan is under but he serves only as a tight ass and eventual romantic prop. Harvey Fierstein voices one of the other loons under command. Although screenplay is thin it does pass as hilarious with a broad message of endurance and family loyalty. Score: 7 / 10"
"Hitchcoc","8","1","1","24 June 2015"," A Very Good Character
","I took my kids to this film when it was first released. I had not seen it since. My daughter holds it in high regard. It is quite a nice film. Mulan, the title character, is being groomed to marry, following the various requirements of one in her position. I would be interested to see how Chinese people today would accept or reject her as a character. The empire is being invaded by the Huns and one member of each family must go fight. Since she is an only child, her frail father must again put on his military uniform and go to fight. He can barely walk and it is horrible for Mulan to watch. She cuts her hair, dons the military clothing, and sets out to join the fray. She is accompanied by a dragon that the spirits have given her out of fear for her safety. Unfortunately, he is relatively useless. Played by Eddie Murphy, he is pretty much the same character as Donkey from Shrek. His mouth flaps constantly with no filter. Once she enters the service, she must maintain her boy-ness and perform deeds that make her useful to them. Her successes are often accidental, but she begins to be seen as a force to her fellow warriors. The Huns are enormous and dangerous, and she must eventually face off the with their leader, no easy task. This is all about having no standing in a culture of sexism that has been around for centuries. This would be quite inspiring for young girls."
"Mario64","8","1","1","31 July 2014"," A Strong Heroic Tale.
","Mulan came out towards the end of Disney's peak era of animated musicals, which began in 1989 with The Little Mermaid and ended in 1999 with Tarzan. The company released 9 major feature films of that genre in that period, and I rank Mulan is somewhere about 5th or 6th in that pack; that's no insult given how strong most of the films were. This is a quite entertaining, beautiful film, with very good musical numbers, which only lacks in a few story elements and a central heroine not quite as well-rounded as the likes of Ariel, Belle or Jasmine from past films.<br/><br/>Mulan, voiced by Ming-Na Wen, can't seem to act as a ""proper"" Chinese lady and find a husband. She decides to take her physically ailing father's place when every family must give a man for war that has come upon them by the Huns. Dressing and acting like a man she's awkward in the training at first, but she eventually becomes one of the most impressive of all the soldiers, while the man leading her and the squad is one she admires and finds quite dashing as well. Along the way she gets some much needed help from a small but determined dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy.<br/><br/>The film has a nice combination of comedy and action, although they are within a story somewhat clunky at times. This is no doubt a gorgeous film, from ancient Chinese villages to snowy mountain peaks to the Forbidden City. The title character is certainly a strong willed female hero, and mostly it is not by chance but by the choices she makes which determines her fate. Unfortunately she just didn't engage me as a person like any number of other Disney leading ladies; as much as I admired her strength her character basically swung in two modes: awkward bumbling girl and super-brave hero woman. It's a good Disney heroine, but not a great one. The songs are nice, with a couple being fairly memorable.<br/><br/>On balance the good stuff in this film far outweighs the minor issues I had. Mulan, even if it isn't one of the best Disney animated musicals, is certainly one that should satisfy those of all ages looking for a rousing and inspirational tale.<br/><br/>One last thought: What the heck were they thinking with that first song in the ending credits? It doesn't fit movie at all."

","Growing up, I watch another Disney movie that still holds up to this day even as a young adult and this is that film. It may not be as strong as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King, but it's a lot better than some of the later films in the early 2000s (except Treasure Planet, Lilo & Stitch, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, and The Emperor's New Groove).<br/><br/>The story is great and the way they made a Disney princess become a hero is what made it work. The comedy is well thought out and Mushu, the dragon, is very funny as the comic relief. The pacing is fine, the dialog is pretty good. The characters are pretty good too and the voice acting is top-notch. Ming-Na did a solid job as the beautiful Mulan who determines to save her father's life by replacing him in an army. Donny Osmond is charming as General Shang, the villain Shan-Yu is a frightening villain and is easily one of the best out there. Like I said before, Mushu is funny thanks to Eddie Murphy's great voice work.<br/><br/>The songs may not be as memorable as the other Disney scores, but they're fine enough for me to listen to. Especially ""Reflection"", which is a lovely little tune I will sing forever. The best part is the animation. The look of China, the emperor's palace, and the mountains are great as are the character animation.<br/><br/>Overall, Mulan may not be as solid as the three films I've already stated, but it's a childhood classic that has been stuck with me for a while and would be looking forward to watch it again. Thumbs up!"

"Dawalk-1","10","1","1","26 March 2012"," A Disney Heroine Like No Other.
","I remember first seeing and hearing previews/ads of this Disney animated feature over a decade ago, when it was set for a summer release back in '98. Before then, I hadn't heard of the original Mulan legend, so I would've thought that this was a completely original film by Disney and there was no inspiration for it to take and adapt or remake. I never saw this in theaters, which looking back on it, I wish I had, but I would own it later when it was brought to VHS since my mother bought a copy of it for me from a Wal-Mart and I'm so glad she did. <br/><br/>And since seeing this, it has been my most favorite or just one of my most favorite Disney animated movies. One of the reasons why I love it so much and what I love about it is the fact that it has a heroine who appeals to both the male and female genders. The eponymous character seems to be the first to do so and I think that's such a great thing. Another is it's a jam-packed, action-adventure thrill ride that will keep y'all on the edge of your seats. I like the fact it was made at the now defunct Disney Animation Studio in my home-state, Florida.<br/><br/>What separates Mulan from the other Disney heroines is when she decides to fill in for her father by joining the army (since she has no brothers and he has no sons). She proves that women can be action heroes too. Evidently as she succeeds in helping defeat the Huns. For me and probably most other males, she's my most favorite Disney heroine and I'd also consider her to be the best. The moments with Mushu and Cri-Kee are great too. I wish the former's musical number could've been possible to make it into the final cut of the movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, if no one reading this has already seen it, I recommend to see it for yourselves. It's not to be passed."
"kdnor2011","8","1","1","1 February 2012"," One of my favorite Disney Movies
","Mulan seems to be one of those Disney animated movies that everyone seems to like, but no one seems to love. It was one of those movies of the Disney Renissance that didn't get the praise of their earlier movies like Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Lion King. Well personally, I love this movie, I actually prefer it to Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid, two movies that tried to be femenist. Sure there are a few things that I can nitpick about, but this movie just works so well for me.<br/><br/>First the characters: Mulan is a kick-ass heroine that is the best female lead Disney has had in, well, ever. Seriously Belle, Ariel, Jasmine, Nala, Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, they all did almost nothing. Mulan on the other hand killed Shan Yu with a fan. All the army members are good, if kind of forgettable. Shang is a hero who doesn't upstage Mulan. Mushu can be really Funny at times, but probably the funniest character was Mulan's grandmother.<br/><br/>Next, the animation: It may not be Disney's best animation ever, but it still looks really good.<br/><br/>The songs: while a couple are kind of forgettable, I absolutely love ""I'll make a man out of you."" And both ""A girl worth fighting for,"" and ""Reflection,"" are good as well.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fun, the comedy really works, and it has a good message about femenism."
"ggk-34-546807","10","1","1","6 August 2011"," A VERY underrated Disney classic
","This is one of my favorite Disney animated movie! It's not as cutesy as many of the Disney princess movies are - It's about a war of all things and for a change the main heroine is not a princess but a strong female role model. Clever and brave but at the same time clumsy and silly at the moments. The massage is strong and works on many levels, and it has some great dramatic moments (especially the sequence when Mulan escape from home is build pretty powerful, some best music I heard in a Disney movie) however what work best is the comedy. After ""Emperor New Grove"" I find it to be the funny-est of all Disney films. Comedy with Mulan pretending to be a man and all the camp scenes are hilarious and just getting funner and funner. I also enjoy Eddie Murphy who while may look annoying at first he quickly turns into a very lovable and comedic characters. To be honest all characters are great and even those who have few lines are very memorable. The villain lives a impression as well.<br/><br/>Plus how great to see a Disney movie that doesn't focus on a love story. There is a romance element to it, but it's quick and handle mostly for comedic effect. <br/><br/>And what crime would it be to not mention the animation - it's great as usual!<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this one I strongly recommend it to you! Next to ""The Fox and the hound"" the most underrated Disney movie."

","Disney's 'Mulan', set in ancient China' is another visual treat from Disney. The animation is stunning and colourful and it does capture the beauty of old China (as seen in paintings). The story has heart and is a lot of fun to watch. I liked that Mulan was written as the typical fairy tale Disney heroine. She's strong, independent, brave, thoughtful and determined. She has more in common with the male Disney characters like Aladdin.<br/><br/>All the 'good guy' characters are likable but my favourite one is Eddie Murphy's Mushu. There's quite a resemblance to Murphy's other famous character Donkey (from 'Shrek') and this just proves that he has an energetic voice and flair for comedy which is just what the characters require. The rest of the voice actors that include Ming Na, Pat Morita, Miriam Margolyes, James Hong, Miguel Ferrer and George Takei among others do a splendid job.<br/><br/>The jokes work very well as they had me and my family laughing out loud. The songs that were sung by the characters were hilarious and the instrumental tracks were great. Even though 'Mulan' has been criticized by many for its violent content and historical inaccuracy, I think it's one of Disney's great productions. I didn't feel the violence was overdone and where historical accuracy is concerned, it's a Disney movie for goodness sake. That said, I didn't think the film itself was grossly inaccurate even though a few liberties have been taken here and there. Just watch it and enjoy with the family. That's what it's for."

","I believe that this is one of my favorite Disney movies. Maybe what I like so much is that Mulan is not waiting for her prince to come or any damsel in distress deal, but she is an intelligent woman held down by her society. The story: Mulan's father is old but he is called to war. He will probably die. Mulan decides to take his place. This is remarkably unselfish because if she's discovered she will be killed. This shows how much she loves her dear old dad. You just have to see the movie to appreciate it. The songs are amazing (""I'll make a man out of you"" Donny Osmond's voice is fantastic). The extra features were also pretty good. I found ""I'll make a man out of you"" in all different languages very interesting. The animation is great as it shows a lot of the natural beauty of China. So make sure you don't miss one of Disney's greatest(and probably last judging by the way Disney is going down the drain) animated movies. There is a strong message for us all when watching Mulan. The main character, Mulan, represents the cluminess in all of us. She tries very hard to please her parents but always seems to come up short from their expectations until the time is right. I know it was like that for me growing up and for a lot of people i know. Having seen this many times and enjoy it more as time goes by...if i was on a stranded island and can only have 3 DVD movies with me, this would be one of them.

","If the Lion King is the best Disney ever-achieved, they came very close 4 years later with this simple tale set in ancient China. With a extended writing team that looks like a football lineup, the animated retelling of this Chinese legend came up both crisp and fluid. The final 88 minutes cut is well-pace and packed with poignant and witty dialog. Add in the a apropos lyrics that are equally funny or soul-searching deep and you have a movie that has almost as much quotables as people in China for your kids (or you) to try to memorize.<br/><br/>Then you have the multi-nominated score and songs themselves, including the cornerstone ""Reflection"" to give the musical aspect a strong supporting presence. The story is heartfelt and Mulan's character easily memorable. Her story and struggle bring us right into the narrative and the scenes and songs are expertly edited to have the desired emotional impact.<br/><br/>The voice talent is noteworthy with Eddie Mucrphy stealing the show as the sharp-tongued mini-Dragon, Moshu. He brings such impact to the his clever and laugh-out-loud funny banter that his presence is pivotal to the movie's overall drama-comedy balance. Ming-Na gives a believable, less-assured take on the woman who tries to pass herself of as a man, but clearly has a big gap to overcome (Mulan; not Ming-Na!) The animation is superb from beautiful scenery, captivating action sequences, to nuanced facial expressions. If you doubt that this is one of the best animated pictures ever released just look at the 10 wins it received at the Annie Awards. I would go even further and say that it clearly simply ranks as one of the best movies and still is after half a dozen viewings since I first saw it in theaters ten years ago.<br/><br/>Long Live Mulan!"

Course (SPOILER: everybody knelt down in homage to the heroine is quite moving, but the way in which Mulan fights against the wicked Hun is a little bit fast in my opinion...)<br/><br/>All in all, one of the greatest Disney movies that, for some reason, has been forgotten or not included among the best ones."

So far, not one person has mentioned that this is based on a Chinese legend from thousands of years ago. This would probably explain why it is not a typical Disney film and why the heroine is simply an ordinary girl with no noble blood etc. Granted the three soldiers in drag aren't part of Chinese myth, but you get my drift.<br/><br/>Anyway, personally, I would give this film a princely 9 out of 10 as it has kept me amused for many years now and I even have a Mushu stuffed toy, so there! :-)"

","((SPOILERS))<br/><br/><br/><br/>  Mulan is sort of a family movie.  First off the Huns breach the great wall of China.  Then when they send out the war scroll things, how Mulan is brave enough to take her fathers place and pretend to be a boy, that was brave of her.  But the Matchmaker part was truly just hilarious!!!!!!  The training is the most hilarious, when Mushu tells Mulan to do this and do that and he ends up starting a fight is just funny as hell.  The ""I'll make a man out of you"" song is actually a really good part in the movie.  The saddest part of the movie is the part where the general's helmet is found and the other is when they find out that ""ping""/Mulan is a girl when she is wounded in battle.  The part where the rest of the Huns snatch the Emperor and they hold him up and Mulan and the 3 others rescue him is a awesome part, the best part is when the leader of the Huns is blown up.

","I'll be honest here. I started watching this movie with a pretty negative attitude about the whole thing. I think that most Disney movies have gotten worse and worse over the past few years, so I assumed ""Mulan"" would be no exception. But then, after I watched the movie for a little while, I realized it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it might be. The characters are quite well-developed, and the movie itself moves along fairly smoothly. I think the only thing that really ""clogged"" the movie was the frequent songs, although I truly enjoyed a couple of them. All in all, I found the movie quite enjoyable, and I give it about a 7 out of 10."

There's a little dragon friend (Eddie Murphy), a romantic captain of the guard (Donny Osmond provided the singing voice), an evil-looking Hun chieftain, an irritating minister and 3 soldier friends.<br/><br/>Despite what others may say, the songs are terrific - not soul (ala Hercules) or jazz (ala Jungle Book), just normal. It's not a kiddies' film - it's for the whole family.<br/><br/>Frankly, I'm not really a Disney fan and have little patience to watch most animated films. But this one's worth it."
"Kehleyr","7","1","1","9 January 2001"," Would have been better without Mushu's character
","I love cartoons. <br/><br/>I think ever since the first full-length cartoon movies have been made, there was the ""funny"" support character which was responsible for the laughs. <br/><br/>In later times this character was in general the hero's aide: the Genie in Alladin, Philoctetes in Hercules and so on. <br/><br/>The problem is that the funny character tends to get more and more exaggerated every time, borrowing standard and oh-so-predictable lines from poor comedies, spoiling everything. Don't get me wrong: The Genie and Philoctetes were perfect, because they didn't overdo it, but Mushu certainly overdoes it. <br/><br/>What need do we have for this kind of silly humor in a children movie? All the lines were heard and reheard, stupid and boring... and not funny at all. A movie CAN be nice without somebody telling the same old jokes over and over again, jokes which sound the same whether they are told in I-don't-know-which-century China (like in Mulan) or in the next century (like in the last semi-science-fiction movie I have seen, The Sixth Day).<br/><br/>
A cartoon movie is dedicated first of all to children, and I think that at least for them we should keep the movies nice, like the stories were when I was a kid. Why do kids these days watch mostly cartoons about bigger and bigger robots fighting each other and not Tom and Jerry anymore? We should try to change this mentality...<br/><br/>
Other than that the movie was very nice, the musical score was great and did a great job in sustaining the action."

In the chain with The Lion King showing us the wild life in Afrika so touchable for the children so close to them. And in the chain with Pocahontas showing the Indian culture and teaching little children about a part of the American history. And every other movie is a story about it self.

","I have never been a huge fan of Disney movies, but this one has made me reconsider.  I've also never taken an interest in the Oriental culture, so when this movie came out, well, I didn't have ANY desire to see it.  Once I finally did see it though, I was impressed.  Yes, it was modernized and Americanized, but so was every other Disney animated, from Hercules to Sword in the Stone.  American children are the primary marketing target, and what child is going to want to sit through an entirely realistic portrayal of an historical figure or fable?  Most fables are based on gruesome truth, and most historical heroes were normal people who were in the right place at the right time.  This film did what it was supposed to do:  It entertained kids, and it gave me the desire to learn more about that culture, which I never thought would happen.  Thanks Disney--my next overseas trip will be to see the Great Wall."

","Maybe I am expecting too much of a Disney cartoon portrayal of Chinese history.

If you want them to be entertained, get them to watch a talking fish etc.<br/><br/>One viewer found Red Chamber depressing. Well, I found Disney's portrayal of China's Joan of Arc (Oriental Yentl?!) depressing. Who knows, in the future, a Disney movie about ""Young George Washington and his band of merry revolutionary friends going off to fight the evil bratty British"" or ""Young Abraham Lincoln and his wise and noble friends went to free the slaves with his witty asides and his magical top hat, challenging the evil slavers to dance offs"" with the appropriate American contemporary lingo will be made."

","Not really poor, by anybody's standards except Disney's, that is. This movie shot for yet another in a long line of breath taking animation extravaganzas for the famed studio. It fell a bit short.<br/><br/>The movie has many scenes of wide shots, enormous structures, army multitudes, and feeds its dialog with plenty of ancient Chinese wisdom. But there is little involvement for the audience where the central characters, especially Mulan herself, are concerned. In a movie about a woman who impersonate a man in order to become a soldier, that is integral to invoke interest. But the story never pulls it off; at best, Mulan comes off as a spoiled rich daughter who whines to herself, and sneaks around regardless of the consequences. It's difficult to accept her as a heroine of ethnic diversity (as was intended, it seems) when the character sounds more like a modern western middle-school girl talking on her like cell phone. The Chinese folk tale character was lost in translation somewhere.<br/><br/>By the time she does her super hero routine in the battle scenes, it only evokes a ho-hum response: did we (yawn) beat the bad guys, yet? Most scenes from the film are too over the top to be taken seriously. Others are forgotten soon after seeing the film.<br/><br/>The film has its moments, but it's among the weaker movies by Disney."

The music also pales in comparison to the great scores of other Disney films. And finally, the villain is almost as forgettable as the songs. Can't even remember his name.

"JackCerf","5","3","6","8 August 2014"," An Ambivalent Message
","This is not quite the story of self realization and female empowerment that the commercial and internet reviewers are calling it. If she is a role model for the independent girl, Mulan is a very ambivalent one.<br/><br/>Mulan does balk at being married off by the matchmaker, she does go off to war, and she does prove to be not only tough and brave but the smartest soldier in her outfit. She twice saves the life of Li Shang's, her commanding officer and love interest, and she kills the chief of the Huns. The Emperor, who says ""A girl like this doesn't come along every dynasty,"" gratefully offers her a seat on the Imperial Council.<br/><br/>Having seen the wider world at its ugliest in wartime, Mulan is uncomfortable with her newly won status. She turns down the offer because, she says, she has been away from her family too long. Prodded by the Emperor, the deeply smitten but none too swift Li Shang follows to court her. As the movie ends, it is perfectly clear that she will marry him, with the enthusiastic support of her mother and grandmother, who had despaired of ever marrying her off.<br/><br/>Li Shang is brave, conscientious, honorable, from a good family, and not all that smart. You can see him 30 years later in his father the general, a dignified, worthy man who gets his army massacred by the Huns. He is still an excellent match for Mulan and her family, and she is an excellent match for him. He'll love and honor her in very comfortable surroundings as he pursues a career at court. She'll run the marriage and bring some brains and spirit into the Li gene pool. Their sons should do very well. <br/><br/>Their daughters are another story. The Emperor sees Mulan as something that ""doesn't come along every dynasty,"" not as an example of half the population of his realm. And Mulan turns down that seat on the Imperial Council. Her family comes first, and she's been successful enough already. She turns her back on her own exceptional quality. Mulan doesn't put on a glass slipper, but she makes her own glass ceiling. <br/><br/>If the movie has a message for girls, it is that the wider world of men is a nasty, hard and dangerous place. Having a successful career there when you're young is good because it wins you respect and puts you in touch with a much better class of husband material when the time comes to leave your career behind, go home, and settle down with your own family. Mulan's courage, spirit and intelligence raise her out of the marriage market to which she appears foredoomed in the first reel, only to win her the one extraordinary man whom she deserves in the last.<br/><br/>Mulan is popular entertainment shrewdly and successfully designed to appeal to an audience that favors gender equality in principle but is ambivalent about its price. While we'd like our daughters to do well in their own right, we'd also like them to mother our grandchildren. Mulan is all in favor of young women of intelligence and spirit going out to prove themselves in the world run by men, but it is equally in favor of their settling down with the right young man to carry on the family after they have gotten the career thing out of their system."

She deserved a better movie, in my opinion.<br/><br/>First of all, the songs and score are just not that memorable (with the exception of ""Reflection"", and even that is pretty conventional). The animation was not as impressive. Compare the animation to that of ""The Lion King"". Every shot in that film was an ""awe"" moment. In comparison, Mulan looked like it was made for home video. The villain, while scary, was more of a caricature than a fully developed character. Disney always did a great job with villains, so this was a missed opportunity. Also, I really missed a romance. Now, some may love that Mulan never got together with Shang (at least in the first film), but romance is what gives Disney films their spice! Overall, the story just didn't excite me. I saw it once in college when it first came out, and didn't see it again until recently. That just shows how much I really missed watching it (lol). It's admirable that Disney would do a film about a Chinese girl who dresses as a man to fight in a war, but they could have done a better job of it."

","Mulan, directed by Tony Bancroft & Barry Cook, produced by Pam Coats, is one of Disney's first princess', that really wasn't a typical princess, doing princess duties. Bancroft & Cook incorporated great heart-warming messages throughout the story, treating the kids like actual human beings, and also giving the adults something to be invested in as well. This was a big ""girl power"" movement, but I was perfectly okay with it, due to it's soulful messages. The story was pretty fast paced, but well balanced with the tones & amount of content they had to offer.<br/><br/>Hand Bacher & Ric Sluiter did an amazing job bringing these fantastic drawing-animations to life, backed up with favorable voice overs by Eddie Murphy, BD Wong, and more! All of these characters looked great, and were balanced out very well; nobody shadowed one another. Mulan was an empowering character, that you really cared about because she embraces such an influential & powering figure. Her character development meant so much to the film, with the narrative flowing through her actions. Mushu is one of my favorite Disney characters of all time! He is the needed comedic relief of the film, having just enough screentime to not over saturate his character. The antagonist is pretty creepy, while posing a huge threat at all times. All of the additional side characters were great! They were all great fun, and utilized nicely, complimenting Mulan.<br/><br/>The screenplay was very serious at times, but managed to sneak in well placed comedy, and deep dialogues. The dialogues were wise and witty, with a few silly moments to really even out the tone & pacing.<br/><br/>The score by Jerry Goldsmith had a great battle score. Goldsmith had a hand from Stevie Wonder, Mathew Wilder & David Zippel, to help create these near-classic songs.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was very unique, and it truly paid off. Disney classic!"

The plot is pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be.<br/><br/>Ming-Na Wen gives a more than acceptable performance in the lead role. Eddie Murphy, though, is definitely the most memorable voice from this. I don't love his character, who is a bit too cartoon-y and looks out of place, but Murphy is simply funny, in what certainly feels like a precursor to his role in the 'Shrek' franchise. None of the other cast standout, yet still give what's required.<br/><br/>Animation-wise it's nice, while a few of the songs are catchy. I don't, as already alluded to with Murphy's Mushu, overly rate the character design. Aside from the aforementioned, I also don't like how Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) looks - he, at least to me, just looks angry all the time rather than terrifying or threatening.<br/><br/>I do class this as a film worth watching for sure, the pacing helps keep things enjoyable."

It's a pleasant movie, a gem from late in the Disney Renaissance that benefits from its mostly understated strengths: Mulan is a great heroine, the art style evokes Chinese watercolor painting, and the songs are lovely. The ""girl power"" theme is presented in a non-preachy manner too, a rarity in current Hollywood movies which feel the need to hammer their points home.

","Mulan is a well-known ancient folktale in Chinese history. It tells the story of mulan, who disguises herself as a man and goes to the war to protect the country in place of her aged father, and finally returns as a national hero/heroine. Although the story of mulan was evidently modified from its original, Disney did a fantastic job at retelling the story, and delivered it through the beautiful hand-drawn animation that has been lost to us for many years. As a Chinese myself, I know the mulan story like millions of Chinese people do. Some people (espcially Chinese people) may not like the Disney version of mulan simply because Disney didn't stay true to the original, but i feel somewhat differently about this. Not only did i have no problem with Disney's decision to make modifications to mulan's story, I actually kinda appreciate that they did. Cuz Disney's retelling of mulan turned out to be rather amazing, and even better than the original in my opinion. I mean, the original story is great, but it lacks fun and humor, which you can find in Disney's mulan. In the Disney version, Mulan is an outgoing, smart, and independent young woman who has difficulty fitting in the more traditional and reserved ancient Chinese society, where a woman's value is judged by marrying into a good family and being a good wife. So naturally this creates conflict and inner struggle for mulan, and thus brings out the musical number ""reflection"" that expresses mulan frustrations and desires. This song is so beautifully written and the lyrics have such meaningful morals and depth that it touches me every time i hear it, and I'm a guy! This song can certainly relate to a great many of young people, not only girls but also boys, cuz its central theme is all the same, that is to be your true self regardless the environment that you in. And now back to the movie, there's a lot to love about Disney's mulan: the story, the fun characters, the songs and music, the beautiful animation, etc. The story is smoothly-paced and very believable. You have no problem understanding why things happen the way they do and why mulan has taken certain actions. And I think Disney created the characters very successfully because they made them look like real Chinese people instead of the classic Disney characters that we used to see. And they made the backgrounds in the animation look like beautiful Chinese landscape paintings, which really amazed me! And the opening of the movie is probably one of the most brilliant among the Disney animation features. I was completely blown away when i first saw it in the theater. Although Disney didn't completely stay true to the original mulan, it stayed true to the spirit of the original story and the spirit of china in most part! And as Mulan being a Chinese story, i think Disney did its best to make it look like and feel like Chinese, and i really appreciate their effort. So thank you Disney, for making mulan so great!"

","When I was like 6 years old I think I bought the VHS with birthday money and I watched it over and over.<br/><br/>This is a movie I don't think I'll ever stop rewatching. As good as it is that feminism is getting more and more popular, we unfortunately have too many writers who think they can score brownie points by waving the black and purple flag without anything to say about a struggles of women. Ocean's 8, Brave and that god awful Dracula Adaptation in 2019 just pandered to the audience by telling them what they wanted to hear at the expense of well developed characters and good story telling.<br/><br/>Mulan is therefor perhaps even more relevant now than ever as what a good empowered female movie should actually look like, and this is over a decade before #metoo.<br/><br/>A lot of this is to do with Mulan herself. She is a good character because she is neither a helpless damsel in distress like Snow White nor the opposite problem of a character that has no personality beyond being practically perfect in every except in having no real personality, like Hermione Granger.<br/><br/>She is clearly smart and resourceful from her dog powered chicken feeding device (It's a lot more simple than I make it sound) but when she enlists in the army she is as much out of her depth as anyone but she has the capacity to rise to the challenge in a believable way and they don't spend too much time on it. Mulan is the perfect fusion of relatable underdog and credible hero. While in a lot of comparable movies, the human protagonist is almost one of the blandest with the anthropomorphic help carrying the show, but she has perhaps the most personality of any pre-Tangled ""Princess"".<br/><br/>We have not only an internal conflict of a person not knowing where they belong but also a material one in Mulan trying to spare her father military service and the too strands coalesce so elegantly in this story of overcoming the self, of friendships emerging between initially hostile parties and of also of the futility of war in a mature and subtle way (""A girl worth fighting--"" cue reality check). One really gets a vivid sensation of the destruction of armed conflict in a way one typically doesn't see in the ""family"" movie.<br/><br/>It ticks all the other boxes you expect it too and more: the music, not just the songs but the intense score, the immersive sense of local color juxtaposed to the austerity of battle, the comedy, the pathos, the impeccable structuring of the story and intense images (Mulan must have worn the most easily removied make-up ever but I don't care), that all come together in a feature that is more of a treat each time.<br/><br/>My only real qualm is an unsavoury spitting attempt but that's a small thing.<br/><br/>This is what a feminist family movie looks like."

It was the first time that Asian, especially Asian women, have a chance to show their strength to the world, that Asian women do not follow the stereotype of tiny, skinny, lowliness, and pavid.

"films-22537","8","0","0","22 February 2020"," My very involved reasoning on why I liked but didn't love this movie
","It seems what makes this movie stand out to most of its fans is the fact that Mulan is a female action hero and not a rich princess, she's Asian and not white and it shows little girls that they can and should be treated equally as boys. However, I'm not a kid, I don't have kids, I'm not a sexist, or a racist, so none of these things affects me looking at this as anything more than just a cartoon. A cartoon that's the intellectual property of a multibillion-dollar company that had nothing more in mind than making the most money they could by exploiting a market of fans dissatisfied with the status quo that Disney themselves perpetuated with movies that had white women waiting for a rich handsome prince charmings to save them. They did those movies when it served them and stopped when it didn't. I don't say that try and sound like I've found out their big secret, I say that to say this movie is just okay to me, because of MY perspective. However, I do respect and understand that there are other ways of looking at this movie that would elevate it to others. But just not me, Eddie Murphy was funny, the villain was pretty forgettable and the love story was so tacked on that if felt like something done in protest, as if they filmmakers said, this is my movie and if you cut it off here it's done, but let it play a few minutes more and you have the studio mandated ending, but I also could be way off. Not bad, not great, good."
"pintaxandre","7","0","0","15 February 2020"," Better as most Disneys
","An interesting female character with some depth. You don't see that everyday and even less in a Disney.
The animation has not aged well, but that's inevitable in 2020 where the technique has known so much imporvement in the past years.
The film's beginning is the weakest part in my opinion. I couldn't feel invested in Mulan's fate because she acted in such a dumb way that it seemed inevitable she would be in unpleasant situations. But from the point where she begins er training, has a goal and is focused, I was in. The ending is magnificent in every way.
However, I am not a fan of this disney-ish chinese culture. That's personal but Disney bringing its touch to every culture, more particularly one that is so different, is out of place in my opinion.

"freemantle_uk","7","0","0","19 January 2020"," The Disneyfication of a Chinese Legend
","The animation of Mulan is what you would expect from Disney adapting a Chinese legend - i.e. being a film that features cute animal sidekicks and kid-friendly humour.<br/><br/>Mulan has a positive message about a girl who wants to save her father's life from being conscripted and ends up becoming the saviour of China. There is the growth of her relationship with her war comrades see her as a liability and ends up loving her. There were powerful moments like when Mulan's father accepts his conscription papers and practices with his sword despite being frail health. ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" was a great musical number.<br/><br/>But the film does not stand up as well against some of the other films from the Disney Renaissance because it relied more on slapstick humour than some of the other films from the period.<br/><br/>It is an enjoyable but minor offering from the House of Mouse."

"lishang2001","10","0","0","2 December 2019"," Making a Woman Out of Mulan
","In their live-action revival of Mulan, Disney redefines the standard for modern princess tales in this new and improved take on a beloved children's movie. Watchers who went to see the original Mulan will be met with many familiar faces in this film, but the movie they grew up with is a far cry from this remake.<br/><br/>Liu Yifei gave a compelling performance as high school junior Mulan, whose soccer team is cut due to a lack of funds. When the boys' coach refuses to give her or her teammates a tryout, they devise a plot to disguise her as her brother so she can train with his school's team during preseason and beat her own school. Mulan navigates a new school and team, all under the nose of her watchful and traditional parents.<br/><br/>This film provides great entertainment with its vibrant cast and twists on the original tale. In the past, Disney's attempts to express different cultures have fallen short in their representation. Karo incorporates a plethora of elements of Chinese culture in Mulan's everyday life, namely in her home life and relationship with her parents. She is a relatable, average teen, yet she is also faced with navigating what it means to be a first generation American. Karo's directing style preserves the humor of the original Mulan but revitalizes what it means to make a kid's movie with great potential for impact.<br/><br/>The one arguably integral character that was missing from this live action take was Li Shang. Older audiences might have been shocked to see him missing from the screen; after a few scenes, however, it was easy to see how Mulan didn't need him to complete her goal and provide a fulfilling plot.<br/><br/>Although this film is a far cry from serious, it manages to down the same female stereotypes that Disney has set out to do for decades far more effectively than the original. Mulan proves not only her own might, but the potential of her entire girls soccer team and any other girl out there to be successful at their passion. Audiences both laugh at Mulan's antics and rejoice with her in her triumphs. The evolution in dialogue with her parents also tackles the cultural pressures she faces.<br/><br/>Despite any minor shortcomings in this light-hearted film, Karo's Mulan beats out the first Mulan film in what it takes to create a feminist 'princess' movie. This film is fun, creative, and inspiring, and sure to empower tiny female audiences everywhere."

Mulan really stands out among all the great Disney movies for me because of how unique and different it is. the story of a young woman disguising herself as a man in the army in order to save her father dosnt sounds like your typical Disney movie and it isn't which is why its so great. the animation is absolutely stunning the attention to detail is just flawless. the characters are all charming and memorable especially Mulan herself who stands out as easily the best Disney heroine of all time. her sidekick Mushu voiced by the very talented Eddie Murphy is absolutely hilarious and a total scene stealer. the movie has many emotional and powerful scenes that to this day still make me cry every time I watch them. the movie also has many great action scenes that are always fun to watch.

","First take: admittedly not one of my favorite films Disney has done, mostly serviceable, yet also, like with most of their films, there is an easy, watchable likeability to it, and it's never boring, it just didn't live up to other standards I may unrealistically have set.<br/><br/>The acting: the main lead is great. She's charming and has a great voice for a kit of the songs. As do the rest. We have to sidekicks and meaning if not a tad over the top villains, and they are playing well, despite a dose of stock.<br/><br/>The songs:
All great, all memorable, here we are treated to 3 tracks that are very catchy indeed. They all progress the story and comment on the situation. The standout is easily Make a man out of you.<br/><br/>The Animation:
Classic hand drew beauty here. A lot of backgrounds the leap out due to their sheer size, plenty of expressive faces and a nice imperial aesthetic that blends well with the culture however accurate.<br/><br/>The story:
Maybe it doesn't hold up as much now or has been done so many more times and better, but a story of female empowerment, especially back then, before it really blew up, should be praised and respected. Also, a character who fights for her family and what's right.<br/><br/>Final take:
Not one loved as many others, but it is perfectly fine for anyone really. It has a nice story and good songs and looks gorgeous, but maybe after time, it proves a bit serviceable."

","Mulan is one of the films I watched when I was a little girl and also it is one of those films I love to this day. I don't know whether Mulan is just a legend or she really existed in the real world, but she is kind of a hero to me. I love her story of taking his father's place and went to war. It's so touching.<br/><br/>I only know the Chinese version. So, I don't know her name really is Hua Mulan, or the surname is something and Mulan, but if it is, I'd say Disney got it wrong. I really don't like the surname Fa. Whenever I hear that surname Fa, it makes me annoyed. So, I prefer Hua.<br/><br/>What makes me love Mulan is of course the story. And also it's amazing original score, especially, the tune of that scene where Mulan prepares herself to go to war and takes horse and leaves home. That scene is also one of my favourites.<br/><br/>I think the original story doesn't have anything about dragon which is Mushu in this film. Disney put that part by themselves. But that part is also good too. Wherever Mushu appears, I find it quite funny. That's why I love Mushu.<br/><br/>All in all, Mulan is an amazing animation which will never get old. Even it is, it's like old but gold. Hence, Mulan is one of those animations that everyone must watch at least once in their lives."

She makes the decision to sneak out the next morning with her father's armor and to take his place in the Imperial army with hopes of bringing honor to her family. And because of that she encounters a small red dragon named Mushu, who would become her trusty sidekick. Despite the fact that this one of the only Disney movies with a heroine, the film, written by Robert D. San Souci, and directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft, successfully portrays the character developing into a brave young woman.<br/><br/>A great deal of people put the movie Mulan in a negative light because throughout the film Mulan does many things such as, disobey her parents wishes, destroy the emperors palace, lie to her superiors, and run away from home. These actions are not something people want their children watching nor repeating. Along with that Mulan tries to justify her actions by saying she was staying ""true to her heart"", which is supposed to make everything okay because she had good intentions. The movie does not make it look like its a bad thing because all Mulan's inappropriate actions ended up saving China and everything wrong she did looked great. Which of course only happens in Disney movies, not in reality. There have been a lot of raised eyebrows and concerns among critics who don't view rebellious Chinese teenager, Mulan as a good role model for young kids or young girls. Worrying that children will because of Mulan believe it is okay to disobey or lie as long as they have good intentions. But it is not Mulan's defiance that makes her cool or a good role model, it is her bravery in certain situations, overcoming her disadvantages, and bringing honor to her family by overcoming fear. Some critics feel that the film Mulan also discriminates against women and throughout the film puts women second to men. Juliane Fang writes, ""This is exemplified in an argument between Shang (Chinese army captain) and Chi-Fu (Emperor's adviser) , when Shang says, ""she's a hero!"" and Chi-Fu responds with, ""she's a woman! She'll never be worth anything!"" Despite the negative attitude towards woman, Juliane Fang adds that Mulan is still the hero in the end. However, she only became a hero and achieved this status by faking a masculine being. And in that, the film is stating that success is primarily a male quality.<br/><br/>But, although, the movie demonstrates negative attitudes towards women, it does very well portray a girl developing into a woman, bringing honor to her family, and respect to herself. ""As the Emperor (Pat Morita) tells Shang after Mulan rides back to her family, 'You don't meet a girl like that every dynasty.' He's right."" Despite the movies weaknesses, the directors of the film Mulan do a good job in showing her struggles and her growth in confidence from the beginning to the end of the film. For example, Mulan is a good role model for young girls because while preparing for war all of the soldiers are brought to a camp for training. She starts off weak and slow, but she doesn't want to disappoint her family, so she becomes determined to be a good warrior. And because of that she is able to do everything the men can, you couldn't tell she was different. She is also seen as brave by her bold moves such as when she uses a rocket to shoot snow on a Clift to create a landslide effect and wipe out the enemies. These parts of thre movie are positive for young children and teen girls. These certain scenes reveal Mulan's bravery and courage.<br/><br/>Futhermore, the film successfully portrays a young girl overcoming obstacles, the emotions she felt during those obstacles, as well as the good result after doing what she felt was right. The movie has a positive influence on children, especially Mulan's sidekick, Mushu, who makes the film so much more enjoyable. And he is a perfect balance of rebellion and humor, to not make parents raise an eyebrow at the film and question its message. Even though the Disney Film Mulan incorporates doubtful situations and mirrors gender discrimination, its natural humor makes it easy to connect and relate to the movie. The depiction of the main character's emotions throughout the movie make it far exceed the others with a strong heroine role. This film demonstrates a role model for young kids and teen girls, and strikes certain emotions that are not typical for family films, reinforcing that Mulan is not a typical Disney movie."

The movie has a positive influence on children, especially Mulan's sidekick, Mushu, who makes the film so much more enjoyable. And he is a perfect balance of rebellion and humor, to not make parents raise an eyebrow at the film and question its message.
Even though the Disney Film Mulan incorporates doubtful situations and mirrors gender discrimination, its natural humor makes it easy to connect and relate to the movie. The depiction of the main character's emotions throughout the movie make it far exceed the others with a strong heroine role. This film demonstrates a role model for young kids and teen girls, and strikes certain emotions that are not typical for family films, reinforcing that Mulan is not a typical Disney movie."

","If ""Mulan"" was made today, instead of reviewing her lesson for the Lady matchmaker, she would be found trying some new moves with her father's sword. And the song ""Reflection"" would include a chorus where Fa Mulan would pull a ""Let it Go"" and say ""But What I (Really) Want is..."".<br/><br/>If ""Mulan"" was made today, the grandmother would have sided with Mulan all along and encourage her to follow her dreams. Which leads me to think that she wouldn't have alerted the family when Mulan left home to go fighting instead of Fa Zhou and maybe we wouldn't even have Mushu.<br/><br/>Speaking of Mushu, if ""Mulan"" was made today, we certainly wouldn't have Eddie Murphy as the voice actor. Though I'm not sure they would have made the effort to cast one Asian actor for every single character, the scene-stealing sidekick would have certainly been voiced by an Asian-American star. And why not? Listening to the little red dragon, I was wondering whether it was Axel Folley or the Donkey who got caught in a time loop that took him to the Han dynasty... and I wonder why they didn't try to get Jackie Chan for the part (was he that busy with ""Rushmore""?)<br/><br/>If ""Mulan"" was made today, we wouldn't have the cricket because he would be as needless in 2018 than he was in 1998...<br/><br/>If ""Mulan"" was made today, she would have been a natural-born warrior impressing the soldiers with her skills from the very start instead of being that ""adorkable"" unexperienced maiden trying to pass for a man. Everything would have been done to tone-down the effect of her cross-dressing and reduce it to the cutting of her hair.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, if ""Mulan"" was made today, I'm not sure we'd have that badass synthetized score during the dressing moment. Not even sure we'd have so much music that scream ""Nineties"" (and yes, it came from Jerry Goldsmith, of all the composers!)<br/><br/>If ""Mulan"" was made today, a song like ""Like a Man"" wouldn't exist. (I wish they would keep the tune though because it's catchy as hell).<br/><br/>If ""Mulan"" was made today, Shan-Yu wouldn't have been turned into such a scary-looking villain in case it might offend Hunnish populations.<br/><br/>Now that one is risky: if ""Mulan"" was made today, would there be a romance? Would they keep the character of the young captain Shan?<br/><br/>Let's face it, ""Mulan"" is perhaps one of the few Disney movies where we don't get one but two heroes and Shang even follows a character arc as he starts as an inexperienced and prejudiced soldier trying to fit in his father's shoes to a more tolerant person. Mulan and Shang form a rather interesting ""Yin and Yang"" duo and I wonder if he would have been kept or just turned into some ruthless leader wrongly opinioned about women.<br/><br/>Still, let's stick to the romance. If ""Mulan"" was made today, would they have abandoned any prospect of a romantic relationship and avoid the possibility of two male-looking soldiers being romantically involved. Disney has so much to show, so many grounds to break, so many taboos to fight, that I don't think they would have missed that opportunity for one of the few stories involving cross-dressing. So I'll stick to my guns and say there would be a romance.<br/><br/>That said, if ""Mulan"" was made today, the romance would be one-sided and wouldn't distract Mulan from her mission. Well, as long as they keep that hilarious and risquÃ© ""river-bathing"" scene...<br/><br/>Now, of course, if ""Mulan"" was made today, it would be in 3D.<br/><br/>But if ""Mulan"" was made today, the Great Wall of China would look even greater but I don't think they could have made a more impressive sequence than Huns' epic riding over the mountains. This has got to be one of the most beautiful Disney shots from any movie ever on a pure Eisensteinian or Kurosawan level.<br/><br/>If ""Mulan"" was made today, she would still save the day by causing an avalanche but maybe the writers would have found a better way for our heroes to survive. I want Mulan, Shang, Mushu and the other fellows to live like the next watcher but there are so many insults to the laws of probability in three minutes of the avalanche sequences than maybe all the Renaissance Disney pictures of Disney. And my disbelief was suspended by a looser rope than the one thrown from over a cliff to land on Harvey Fiernstein's head.<br/><br/>If ""Mulan"" was made today, the climax would have kept the concubine cross-dressing but would have ended with an iron-crossing fight between Mulan and Shao-li.<br/><br/>If ""Mulan"" was made today, she would have accepted the job as the Emperor's counselor and never get back home to become a maiden again. Hell, Shang wouldn't have followed her. Wait a minute, of course he wouldn't have... since he's not supposed to exist so it all makes sense that Mulan ends up a counselor, then a general, then maybe the new Empress of China.<br/><br/>In fact, if ""Mulan"" was made today, there would be at least two or three extra female characters, maybe Shao-li would have a daughter who would have been the real nemesis, maybe Mulan would have a little sister (all right I cheated for that one) or maybe the empowering message would have been even more explicit, like ""Brave"", ""Frozen"" and ""Moana"" and would make 1998 Mulan original look like Snow White...<br/><br/>My question is: are there any girls who still don't give a damn about being warriors? Mulan did that out of love for her father and I just hope that will still be the key motive in the 2020 versions but I do expect a few changes to remind me how far we are from 1998... when Mulan was considered a progressive movie.<br/><br/>It's a matter of opinion but I believe it is."
"Bored_Dragon","7","0","0","6 November 2018"," Different kind of Disney Princess
","In a Chinese family with no male children, daughter disguises herself as a male and goes to war against Huns instead of her elderly father. Hilarious Eddie Murphy lends his voice to her sidekick, a clumsy little red dragon. The story is interesting, with lots of Disney humor, but also a good message. Essentially, this is ""coming of age"" and ""women empowerment"" drama, but shown in a typical Disney way, to the extent that even this girl warrior can be classified among the Disney Princesses. I had the impression that someone forced them to make a ""women empowerment"" movie, and then they did their best to disguise it as much as possible. I know that Disney movies are primarily intended for children, but still I think they banalized it too much. Also, I did not like the animation, but the music is excellent. Overall, a pretty good movie and a big step out of the comfort zone for Disney.<br/><br/>7,5/10"

","This was another gem from the Disney vault. It was a story about a lady in China who poses as a man and take her father's place in the Chinese army during a Hun invasion. There are themes about fitting in and redemption in it. Eddie Murphy's comic relief dragon character was ok. This will appeal to any fan of animated Disney films, as it has outstanding stories,songs, and characters."

","My 20th birthday is today, so in honor of the year, I am writing reviews of movies from that year.<br/><br/>Disney released this movie, Mulan, 2 months prior. And it's very good.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie, you must not be near my age. The story, then, if that is the case, follows Mulan, a Chinese girl who is upset that she can't ""honor"" her family, which is proven after failing the expectations of a matchmaker, who is seeking a proper husband for her. So when war is proclaimed, she disguises herself as a man to fight in place of her sickly father. <br/><br/>What positives can I say about Mulan? Well, it's a Disney movie. It has a great story, songs, and the animation is great.<br/><br/>It has some of the most memorable songs(Roger Ebert would disagree, it lost half a star from him for that.) Such songs include: Reflection, A Girl Worth Fighting For,Honor To Us All,and my personal favorite: Make A Man Out Of You.(Which made me cry as a kid, for some reason.) <br/><br/>Most of the cast members you may not not know, Ming-Na Wen(known for The Joy Luck Club) voices Mulan.(Would you have known that had I not told you?) <br/><br/>The most famous one stands out, not just for his popularity, but since it's this comedian's only G-rated movie on his resume. Mushu, Mulan's dragon(not lizard) partner-is voiced by none other than Eddie Murphy. Yes- Raw, Delirious,Harlem Nights, etc.-then Mulan.<br/><br/>Mulan is a great Disney movie-and if you have not seen it, then you should."

","I was wary at first when I first started watching Mulan as back in 1998 when the film was released, there was not much positively said towards women in society so I did not have much hope that this movie would be able to pull off such a powerful women lead back in a time when women were perceived to be lower down in class compared to men. <br/><br/>However, this movie starts out to be one of the best female lead movies that I have watched in a long time. Going by the time in which the movie was made Pam Coats did an amazing job for producing the movie and Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft brilliantly directed the movie in a way to focus on Mulan's journey from a small maiden to a warrior of the army in China and receiving praise from the emperor. <br/><br/>This film is a fantastic movie to show the power then women can hold and the equality that should be faced towards both men and women. This film is still relevant in todays society across the globe and could easier be names as one of the best Disney movies that have been created."

","After watching Hercules, I wondered what was next for Disney. Then this showed up. I'd never even heard of the Chinese legend of Mulan before the movie but it sounded like an interesting premise. And since I'm Chinese-American, albeit half, it's like visiting one of my homelands. Plus, it has a female protagonist who isn't just another damsel in distress or another girlish princess. This is the heroine that works on so many levels. Not only that, there's also a wisecracking dragon (voiced by Eddie Murphy, and one of the few films I enjoyed of his) and many Asian-American actors and actresses in the cast (some of them are actually Japanese, but they did well). And some decent songs and the themes of family and honor. It's quite the feast for the eyes. If you are in the mood for a strong female lead or an Asian-styled adventure or both, look no further!"

","As older Disney cartoons go, this is one of the better ones. The animation, characters, and story are all well-done and entertaining. This movie is funny and dramatic. There's a fun montage in there and a dragon. The only things really holding it back are some historical inaccuracies (we watched this move in Global when we were learning about China's history in high school and the teacher made sure to point out how much this movie got wrong) and some stupid moments. Overall this movie is very entertaining and I'd recommend it."
"bblack1-699-968577","8","0","0","17 June 2014"," All He Needs is a Mic Drop!
","The general consensus about this movie is people really like it, and I like it a lot too. I like the story, the characters, the jokes, and the songs. It's not the best movie, but it's really enjoyable and I have a lot of fun watching it.<br/><br/>ANIMATION: The animation is...good. Unlike some of our earlier movies, it doesn't really have bright and popping colors, nor does it really showcase China. We get some great visuals of Chinese culture (The Great Wall, white space, ""Girl Worth Fighting For"" number), but we don't really see much else. But the designs of the characters are OK, and the backgrounds are nice. All in all, it's good animation.<br/><br/>SONGS/MUSIC: The songs here are pretty good, too. I like ""Please Bring Honor to Us All"" and ""A Girl Worth Fighting For,"" and the sound of China in them. If the animation doesn't totally bring us to China, the music in these songs do. I really like ""Reflections."" It shows us the struggle Mulan is battling in the movie. Of course we all know and love ""I'll Make a Man Out of You."" It's the movie's Number One song: those lyrics, that music, the rhythm - it's awesome! I also really love the ""True to Your Heart"" song during the credits. It sums up the movie, it's a fantastic song, it has 98 Degrees, and it features FRICKIN' STEVIE WONDER!!! That man wrote and sang the soundtrack to LIFE!!...But I digress. The songs are good.<br/><br/>ROMANCE: You might be thinking there's nothing to talk about here, there wasn't really a romance here. Actually, this movie has what I think is one of the best Disney romances ever. We get a couple hints that Mulan and Li Shang are developing a romance, but the movie doesn't focus on it. It doesn't try to give us a random, unnecessary romantic moment like ""The Lion King"" did. They don't get married, they don't commit to a relationship, they don't kiss, they don't even talk about being in love. But we know what's going to happen, it does happen, but the movie doesn't focus on it at all. I think that's great!<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: I always thought Mulan and Pocahontas were one and the same. They both feel as though they don't fit in with their environments, they have free spirits, they do something radical to change their cultures, and they're looked at as strong heroines...And it's for that reason I think Mulan is just OK. Don't get me wrong, I really like her, but from an analytical point of view she's just like Pocahontas and other typical strong female characters. I also really enjoy Mushu. He gets a lot of laughs, and I like Eddie Murphy's portrayal of him. But I think my favorite character is the Emperor. Why? Because he's crudded awesome! Did you hear his dialogue? He says some of the most awesome things ever! ""No matter how hard the wind howls, the mountain will not bow to it."" ""The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all...You don't meet a girl like that every dynasty!"" All he needs is a mic drop! If this Emperor had a mic drop in the movie, he'd be the most awesome character in Disney EVER!<br/><br/>STORY: Like Mulan's character, this movie is very reminiscent of the ""I want to be something bigger and better - My heart tells me I have a greater destiny than this"" story. It's not a bad story, I enjoy it; but it doesn't really add anything new. I enjoy the scenes, characters, songs, and romance, but the story has been done so many times. Disney already released this movie three years earlier, only it was set in early America. Sadly, the story did not phase me at all.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: While the movie didn't have a new, exciting story, the characters and songs will still keep you totally engaged. You'll want to see what they'll do, what sort of people they'll become, and what they'll learn. You'll be rooting for all our main characters, and you'll love them. They are totally worth watching this movie. Of course I wasn't able to write about all the characters, but check out the film and see which ones you like the most. They're pretty good and entertaining. It may not give you a lot of culture, at least nothing new; but give this movie credit, it seems to be making up for the possible racist Siamese cats in ""Lady and the Tramp."" Were those cat racist? I heard that argument, but I don't know for sure...Anyway, watch it and see for yourselves. God bless you. BOOYIKA!"
"Ehamilton40","9","0","0","21 February 2014"," Mulan Synopsis
","Disney's animated and musical film Mulan (Mulan, Bancroft and Cook, 1998) was released into theaters on June 5, 1998. The movie was directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook and used the voices of Miguel Ferrer, Eddie Murphy, and Lea Salonga for some of the main characters (International Movie Database.) During opening weekend, Mulan grossed almost 23 million dollars. The movie went on to make 121 million in the United States and about 304 million in world wide gross revenue (Box Office Mojo.) The movie was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for its original music and received and received an American Society of Composers and Publishers Award for top box office films in 1999. The film was also nominated for and received multiple Annie Awards (International Movie Database.) <br/><br/>This 88 minute animated musical begins with a scene of peaceful China being invaded at night by a group of Mongolian nomads referred to throughout the movie as ""Huns."" (The Xionnu Culture.) The Huns are clearly a major threat to China's society. The audience is then introduced to the main character in the movie named Mulan. Mulan is a young woman who is struggling to come of age the way that her Chinese culture wants her to. She is expected to have the poise and grace of a Chinese lady and is scheduled that afternoon to meet with a matchmaker. Her mother and grandmother help her prepare to meet the matchmaker and give her a small cricket in a cage to carry with her for luck. When Mulan gets to the matchmakers house, things do not go as planned and Mulan ends up spilling hot tea on the woman, making her look clumsy and ill prepared to be a bride. The matchmaker shames Mulan, stating that she will never bring honor to the family as Mulan runs out of the house. Later in the day, the general from the imperial army arrives in their town, stating that one man from each family must go to war to fight against the Huns. Since Mulan's father, an honored veteran himself, is the only male in their family, it is obvious that he must go again to war. It is very dangerous for her father to do this because he is old and could very easily be killed in battle. After watching her father and mother have a quiet conversation, Mulan decides to take matters into her own hands. She cuts her hair and takes her father's armor and horse, leaving for war in the middle of a stormy night. Alarmed by Mulan's actions, her ancestors' spirits awaken and discuss what they should do about the situation. Eager to prove himself, Mushu, a small red dragon, decides that he is going to find Mulan and assist her in becoming a war hero. Mushu appears to Mulan just as she is about to enter the army's camp. He gives her tips on how to walk and talk like a man but it is clear as soon as she walks into the camp that she is extremely out of place. She accidentally starts a fight between the warriors and when the newly appointed captain Shang-Yu walks out, he is obviously disappointed in the group and specifically Mulan. Mulan introduces herself awkwardly as Ping and the group begins training. Things are hard for Mulan at first because she has to adjust to acting like a man and keeping up physically with the rest of the troop. Slowly but surely, however, she begins to prove herself as a valuable asset to the army. When Mulan's troop is called into battle early because of a letter that Mushu writes from the general, Mulan is determined to prove herself further as a warrior. As they travel, the troop comes across an abandoned town, one that had obviously fallen victim to the Huns. The troop is then ambushed by the Huns from the top of a snowy mountain and is eventually forced to confront a group of them head on. Clearly outnumbered, it is obvious that Mulan's troop will not win this battle. However, Mulan thinks quickly and comes up with a fast solution to beat the Huns. She seizes the last cannon and runs toward the enormous group of approaching Huns. Once she gets to a close enough spot, she lights the cannon and shoots it directly towards a snowy mountain. This causes a huge avalanche that wipes out most of the Hun's troop, ending the war and making Mulan's troop the heroes of China. Despite her valiant efforts to keep her womanhood a secret, she is discovered the next night after Shang had heard many rumors that she was female. Instead of killing her as the law demanded, Shang decides to spare her life, claiming that she saved his life the day before and now the two are even. Ashamed that she had yet again disgraced her family, Mulan sets out to leave for home. While she is leaving, Mulan notices that there are Huns still alive and races to the ceremony where the rest of the army is being honored for her accomplishments to warn them. The troops do not believe her until the Huns themselves appear at the ceremony and kidnap the emperor, locking him inside the palace. Mulan runs to the scene and comes up with an elaborate plan to break into the castle to save the emperor. Her plan works and Mulan is recognized by the emperor himself as a great hero of China and offered a position on his council. However, instead of accepting this great honor, Mulan states that she would like to return to her home, hugs her new friends, and turns to walk away. As she is leaving, Shang realizes that he is in love with Mulan and goes with her. The two return home as great heroes of China."

","This is Disney's 36th full-length animated feature, a story about Mulan, a young Chinese maiden who doesn't quite fit in as being the perfect bride and one to bring honor to her family. She also learns that her weakened and limp father is called into the army in order to battle the invading Huns. Fearing for her father's life, Mulan disguises herself as a male soldier and takes his father's place in the army. The spirits of her ancestor want to spare Mulan and inadvertently sends their disgraced former dragon-guardian, Mushu, to bring her back. What follows is a breathtaking adventure where Mulan, trying to prove that she can do things right, attempts to fit in with the other soldiers and train well enough to battle the Huns.<br/><br/>The film has the suspense, thrills and somberness of any war-themed movies, but it is counterbalanced with the laugh-out-loud comedy and humor provided by Mushu and Mulan's fellow ragtag soldier-trio team of Yao, Ling and Chien-Po. Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy, gave the same witty, no-nonsense, hilarious and crackpot personality of the actor. Ming-Na voiced Mulan and gave a smoothing and gentle, yet determined portrayal of the character. I especially like Pat Morita's commanding, dignified and wise portrayal of the Emperor and his line, ""No matter how the wind hows, the mountain cannot bow to it,"" was my favorite.<br/><br/>The movie is made in beautiful animation and great visual effects, highlighting many characteristics of the Chinese culture like the Great Wall of China, the Forbidden City, a Dragon Dance, traditional Chinese robes, a game of Chinese Chess and a spectacular fireworks show. Directors Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook created a non-stop fun and exciting Disney film along with a fabulous story-writing team. And, Composer Jerry Goldsmith provided a brilliant music score, with his haunting and commanding theme when the Huns come charging down the snowy hill being my favorite.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe this is one of Disney's best films and one of my favorite animated films all together - beautiful animation, great music, exciting story and memorable characters, with a very touching emphasis on honor to yourself and your family.<br/><br/>Grade A"

I think Lion King and Beauty and the Beast might be better films over all but I also appreciate Mulan for other reasons. First of all and most important, I think it's great that the hero of Mulan is not the typical white skinned princess waiting for a prince to rescue her like you get in most Disney movies. There still aren't many of those (Jasmine and Pocahontas are the only other non white Disney heroines I can think of) so it's definitely welcome and a step in the right direction!"
"thewillt08","8","0","0","25 November 2013"," Disney's Most Underrated Masterpiece.
","Walt Disney created the masterpiece that is Disney Land and in that came some of the most iconic characters in history. One of the most underrated characters in the Disney Universe is Mulan, in my opinion. Mulan is a strong woman trying to find her place in China. Mulan is a fantastic movie with Eddie Murphy as a funny sidekick, before he was Donkey, and one of the creepiest Disney villains. Mulan is one of the better Disney movies but why does it not seem that way? Why it is not considered one of the best? Well, let's get into it.<br/><br/>The story behind Mulan is rather basic. The Huns, led by Shan-Yu invade China for no real reason. I think that is a real flaw in the movie itself. The villains don't have a rhyme or reason to what they do. They just do it. They are evil for the sake of being evil. Shan-Yu leads the Huns and his haunting theme music is enough to scare any kid but still he is overlooked. This movie took a lot of risks for a kid's movie. There is a war going on, many people die, you do not see it but its implied, and the main protagonist is a woman. Now that is not a sexist remark but most of the memorable Disney movies has the lead woman be a damsel and not a strong leader like Mulan. <br/><br/>I really like Mulan's character. She is incredibly relatable. She is a young girl trying to find where she belongs. She says it in one of the most memorable songs in any Disney movie. ""When will my reflection show who I am inside?"" She eventually goes to war in her father's place. That right there is courageous and foolish. Women are supposed to stay in the house and make babies in China. They are forbidden to fight in war. She does this anyway, and yet she isn't considered one of the greatest characters ever. Mulan is somebody people can look up to and the movie does an amazing job of portraying her. <br/><br/>Eddie Murphy has a special talent for voice acting. Mushu is the lovable dragon that kids enjoy. He brings comedy and many memorable moments. From the first time I saw Mushu as a small kid I fell in love with him. He too is looking to find where he belongs with the ancestors of Mulan's family. The obvious similarities between the two main characters are enjoyable. Thankfully Mushu didn't take too much of the spotlight. <br/><br/>Disney is known for its lovable characters and evil villains but also for its music. Mulan captures some Chinese culture in the song in this movie and they are most memorable. The first song is a bit odd if you listen to the words. It is catchy and fun to sing along to but is basically about the worth of women in China. Look beautiful for a guy to want you and make babies to defend the Emperor. It is little things like this that could be why Mulan does not get the recognition it deserves but the rest of the songs make up for it. A Girl Worth Fighting for is a personal favorite along with Make a Man Out of You. I think I know every word. The songs are well placed and when one ends it reaches the saddest part of the movie. It goes from a high point to a low point. It is interesting for a Disney movie to have this much emotion. <br/><br/>Mulan has many relationships in the movie. The obvious one with her father and Shang but I particularly like the relationship with the three side characters. I'm talking about the bald guy, the thin guy, and the short angry guy. These three are c0molete opposites from each other and bounce off each other perfectly. They are side characters to fall in love with and quote. They have moments that are classic in the movie too. <br/><br/>Overall, Mulan is a great movie that is unfortunately overlooked. People may disagree with me but think about it. You ask somebody what their favorite Disney movie is they probably will not say Mulan. Mulan is extremely underrated and I think it is because it has some controversial parts. The movie itself has everything a Disney movie needs and it also got trashed with a sequel. If you ask me I won't say Mulan is my favorite Disney movie, that is a close one between Hercules, but it stands in my top three with ease. And of course it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. I imagine I will get backlash for thinking it is underrated and the reasons I believe so so please respectfully let me know in the comments."
"rrussell5","10","0","0","18 October 2013"," Mulan *spoiler alert*
","Mulan is a step in a new direction for Disney, providing a thrilling, inspirational tale about a young woman that strays away from the beautiful damsel longing for love that Disney is so famous for. Mulan is set in Han Dynasty China during the invasion of the Hun army led by a barbarian by the name of Shan Yu. In this desperate time for China, a man from every family is drafted to serve in the Imperial Army and defend China against Shan Yu. To protect her family, Mulan disguises herself as a man and takes her father's place, risking her life and the honor of her family. This begins Mulan's adventure as an Imperial soldier and the hardships and perils she will go through in her journey to protect China, all the while protecting her identity. Arriving at the Wu-Shong camp Mulan comes to realize she is not alone in her journey, her ancestors have sent a ""guardian"" to watch over her in the form of Mushu, a ""travel-sized"" dragon meant to guide her and protect her from harm. Little does she know, the claimed guardian is actually an ex-guardian of the family, following the unfortunate demise of one of her ancestors. With Mushu by her side she enters the camp and is faced with the challenges of blending in with the other soldiers. With the help of Mushu, she quickly gains many enemies throughout the camp, taking on the name of Ping and earning herself the title of a ""complete lunatic"". As in all Disney movies, the audience is not disappointed to be introduced to Shang, the handsome young captain and love interest in the story. As ""Ping"" is slowly gaining status among the soldiers, the Hun army continues to move closer and closer to the Emperor. In a desperate effort when it looks like Mulan will never see battle, Mushu and the 'lucky' cricket, Crick-ee devise a plan that sends the troops rushing to the front-lines. When the army arrives, they find total devastation where the Imperial Army and General of China are found dead in the snow. This begins the start of their fight against the Huns in the Tung Shao pass, complete with fiery arrows, intense explosions, and a wound inflicted by Shan Yu himself. This scene is a vital turning point in the movie and sets the scene for Mulan's reveal as a woman and her final decision that will change the fate of China and will either shame her family forever or make her a hero . The movie incorporates the beauty of China and the opening credits begin as a silk painting, with traditional Chinese style art. The painting transitions into the opening scene of the Great Wall and the Hun invasion. This presents a wonderful introduction to the conflict in the story and gives the audience a preview of what is to come. Throughout the movie there are wonderful landscape shots where the audience can see the beauty of China. However the most powerful scenes include those that feature close-ups. A scene that is incredibly powerful and marks the transition of Ping the lunatic into Ping the soldier is the scene where Mulan retrieves the arrow. This scene is filled with close ups of Mulan's face and her struggle and her ultimate victory. This victory follows the song ""I'll make a man out of you"" and in the end, she is a man, not in body but in her determination and strength as a soldier. Overall, this movie is thrilling and is a refreshing change from the Disney princess stories that are so famous. Mulan is a movie that inspires young women to be brave, strong of spirit and to be yourself. Mulan makes it a good thing to be different from the rest and show the change that one can have on the world. One of the most powerful lines from the movie comes from Mulan's father when she returns home from war after she presents him with gifts from the empire. He throws down his cane, hugs her and says ""The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter""."

","Disney nailed it this time, just perfect on my scale.<br/><br/>Before proceeding, I'm an Asian and totally understand the stupidity of some parts of Chinese culture.<br/><br/>They had me cracking up for all those references to Chinese stuff and show so much that ""THIS ALL ARE Chinese"". All the honor, family, woman below man, dumplings, dragons, crickets - so much to talk about. I didn't mean that it was racist or anything, but it was so clear to me that it unintentionally had me laughing.<br/><br/>The only - only - down point to this movie is the music. Disney commonly have at least 2 or 3 good music is their musical. Even The Little Mermaid, a story about a teenage mermaid falling for a guy approximately 10 (TEN RIGHT!) years older than her, has 2 good music! This movie has only one, Reflections. They had to work harder on that department.<br/><br/>Overall, this thing had me cracking up the whole damn time and it was great."

","The movie stars the Huns as the bad guys. OK then, let's go ahead. Texts from the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) repeatedly refer to one Xiongnu tribe or tribal confederation that caused plenty of headaches to that times' Northern China. The name ""Xiongnu"" might be cognate to the name ""Huns"", but the equation Xiongnu = Huns is highly controversial among sinologists and other historians. Anyway, the Xiongnu quit China's history during the 1st and 2nd centuries AD to never come back. Now, by the time the Xiongnu raided Northern China, the most sophisticated known weapon was the crossbow. However, the movie displays a collection of arms, such as flint muskets, fuse guns, huge howitzers, old heavy mortars, that fits almost perfectly the weaponry available in the first half of the 17th century (AD, of course) so in the West as in the Far East. But, did happen anything important by then in China? Well, yes: a people first known as the Jurchens, and from then on as the Manchus, gradually increased their pressure on northern China's border, until they eventually entered Beijing in 1644 and enthroned the Qing Dynasty, the Manchu Dynasty, the last Dynasty. So our brave Mulan seems rather to fight against those Manchu invaders. And why not? Put aside Chinese popular war legends: for 2000 years they have been calling ""Xiongnu"" any northern invader, even Genghis Khan's Mongols. Then either the fire arms or the name ""Huns"" should have been removed from the screenplay. Suppressing ""modern"" weapons is out of question: along with them, half of the movie would go away. So, did Walt Disney Prductions - Buenavista Productions seriously think that calling ""Manchus"" the Manchus they would make a lesser profit? Did they really think the name ""Huns"" would frighten children more? The answer to both questions should be no. Changing History never improved a movie; it were always directors, characters and writers who achieved it. Oh, and don't fear for Mulans's safety: she sure got back with her family and was happy, for, although it's true that the Manchus won, once settled down in China's throne they became Chinese right away, and didn't treat their new subjects worse than other emperors. That's the magic of China: many times invaded, but never conquered."

","I don't watch many Disney films these days, I've probably outgrown many of them, but I took an exception in this case. It had been recommended to me and so I thought I'd give it a look when it came up on TV recently. I was pleasantly surprised, a strong story, some nice animation and a few decent songs thrown in not too shabby. I'll give you my more detailed thoughts after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please go training with the army while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>Mulan is a spirited girl who, having failed to make an impression with the matchmaker, is looking for some other way of bringing honour to her family. China has been invaded by the Huns, lead by the very tough and evil, Shan Yu. An army is being raised by the Emperor and Mulan's father, Fa Zhou, is chosen as one of the conscripts from their village, but he was injured fighting for the Emperor before. He insists he will go, but Mulan has other ideas. Stealing his armour and his sword and taking her horse, Khan, she sets off to join the army in his place, hoping she can pass herself off as a man. The penalty, if she's discovered, is death. To help her on this quest, the family ancestors, inadvertently, send Mushu, a small dragon with ambitions to improve his position. A lucky cricket, Cri-Kee, also comes along on the adventure. The soldiers are led by Captain Li Shang, the son of a General and a very handsome man. Calling herself Ping, Mulan is befriended by three soldiers, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po, but can she pull off this charade and will she bring honour to her family? Well, you probably guessed it, I'm not going to tell you here, those Spoiler Police will be after me if I do.<br/><br/>I found this film surprisingly good, some great animation, a really good story and some pretty good songs along the way. The only let-down (for me) was the inclusion of the voice of Eddie Murphy as Mushu. Whenever I hear him now I think of 'Donkey' from the Shrek films. Don't get me wrong, he has some great lines and does his stuff very well, but I just kept seeing 'Donkey' in my mind's eye. The film started very strongly with a nice set-up and it was looking good until the 'comic relief' is brought in ('Donkey'). It's then a struggle for the narrative, which is very good by the way, to fight its way past the comic japes of 'Donkey'. Fortunately, it does and we end up with a pretty good film that's entertaining, funny (thanks 'Donkey') and, at times, quite dramatic.<br/><br/>Decent performances all round, Ming-Na did a good job as the voice of Mulan, ably backed up by Lea Salonga who did the singing parts for the character. B.D. Wong did a nice job as Li Shang with Donny Osmond doing the singing parts. The voice that really stood out (for me apart from 'Donkey') though was Miguel Ferrer as the voice of the evil Shan-Yu, he was really menacing and made you believe in the character. Honourable mentions go to the voices of; Harvey Fierstein as Yao, Gedde Watanabe as Ling and Jerry Tondo as Chien-Po. I would also like to mention George Takei who had a nice little cameo as the voice of the First Ancestor.<br/><br/>Over all a pretty enjoyable film with lots to admire. The animation of the scene where the Huns are attacking down a snow-covered hill is quite spectacular. Would I watch it again? Yes, I didn't find 'Donkey' all that bad at the end of the day, and, who knows? I may even see him as a small Chinese dragon one day Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score 7.3/10"

","I must say that I have enjoyed this movie. At first thought, I wasn't sure what to expect. Not much of an animations-fan. However, this movie became interesting after only a few minutes. Not a girlish movie (as I had first thought), and the plot was fine too.<br/><br/>Certain things I did not like were that the original plans for Mulan to serve as an average lady were only shown in the first part of the movie (where she performed miserably), and then the movie did not focus anymore upon it (not even in the ending). Furthermore, that sudden change-of-heart were she was sent away by Shang and than excelled in all their training - that was too sudden and did not focus upon her efforts to reach that goal (even though this always happens in most movies).<br/><br/>One more negative plot remark is that Mulan's seemingly primary intention to go instead of her father was because her father's health was very poor and thus she went instead. However, it seemed easy enough not to attend later on, since she was easily asked to leave by Shang when her process seemed to be to no avail - so why did she have to go? One more aspect - that is only seen in cartoons - is that the Huns were able to beat up most of the army and then they came into difficulty with a ragged band of a few 'warriors'. However, this can only be adapted in cartoons :) However, I must say that I did enjoy this movie. It's feel-good aspect is felt throughout the movie (of course, as it progresses along). Furthermore, the fact that certain people do not seem adept to certain aspects and yet they excel in others, is shown in the movie as can be in real life.<br/><br/>The songs (and the singing) were fine and adequate (even though at times they seemed to drag on). Laughter is well packed and distributed in the movie, and thus makes it entertaining - even for the whole family since most aspects were not so childish (although the movie can be easily understood by children)."

","Mulan is an Chinese Legendary about a young girl and her voluntarily- facing adventures. Mulan is the story of the love of the land and sacrifices people do for defending their own national identity.Its genre looks adventure but at the same time comic and romance. The story has a happy start and of course a happy end but in very different settings. The start is the time Mulan gets ready to take part in a contest to be the perfect bride(daughter). The scenes are happy and colorful.It's comic when she is cheating to memorize the motto of the perfect bride and gets the help of a puppy to the house chores. These scenes accompanies with happy nice songs. While at the end the setting is very formal, all the country celebrates the countries victory against invaders and even the emperor bows against Mulan, followed by all other people. The story of Mulan takes place in a small Chinese town where people are living at peace her great ancestors and father as an old warrior makes them an honored family, but her failures, for instance in the perfect bride contest, make all except her father believe she is a black spot for the family and never can bring honor for the family. The time when the war begins is the climax, when the emperor orders all the families to sacrifice a man for defense of the Chinese Empire. Mulan's father who already gave service in the emperor army and was injured is the only male in the family who should fight and since Mulan knows his hard situation, joins the army, leaving home at night in his father's graceful helmet and sword. Since there are no women in the army she should pretend to be his father's son.That's a burden for her because he should also practice hard to be as strong as men, however none of the amateur soldiers are so brilliant. The commander, Shang, tries hard to make these ordinary sometime stupid and comic men a professional loyal army of the emperor. When the Army begins the war, the Emperor's army is defeated hard by Shan Yu's great number of soldiers, but this is Mulan who sacrifices and makes the situation vice versa. The perspective I'm looking at Mulan is something different. My stand point is on the cultural studies point of view. First let's don't forget that Mulan a crystal clear Chinese name is not a Chinese but an American cartoon. It is an American cartoon, but first let's extract the Chinese features which looks dominant in this cartoon. Mulan's story is an old Chinese legend which is the source of Chinese settings, characters, names and even themes. The cast and crew is listed on background that is an old hide on which many Chinese scripts were written during the ancient times. You see also the traditional Chinese designs being drawn in ink, so the start point is Chinese however its music is something between American and Chinese. The setting of Mulan's house is a Chinese house in spring and in one corner there is a Buddhist temple where the ancestors are buried. The faith in ancestor's spirits is distinctly perceptible. Another Chinese myth is the dragon which is the symbol of Emperor of China. His sculpture is in the yard and in next stage the ancestors ask him to protect Mulan in the war. The dragon in Chinese culture is the source of water and rain, so it is a holy feature that many refer their ancestors to dragon.3<br/><br/>When Mulan practices for the contest she gives you notions depicting an ideal traditional woman in China. She should be able to pour tea well and she should have the sense of dignity and refinement. The perfect Chinese girl should be quiet, demure, grateful polite and delegate. The question she asks after her failure in the contest is planned in the song whose refrain is ""Who I am inside?"". Even the time Mulan can save the commander's life, showing great courage, she sings ""I can prove I can do things right"". The third point that is clear to be heard is the time they discover Mulan is a girl and Chi-Fu, the emperor's consultant, sentences her to death. She asks them about the difference between Mulan and Pinn(her male name). All these suggest that the women in Chinese societies suffer from the misunderstanding about their actual abilities.<br/><br/>Another main concept of Chinese culture is the Family honor. Mulan failure in the contest makes her and her family believe that she can not brings the family honor. The lack of males is inferiority for the family because when old men called to war their sons as their representatives answer, but Mulan, who is more courageous than men, has to pretend to be a man to fight.<br/><br/>Loyalty to the emperor and Chinese values are very significant,but the American concepts and signs are also crystalized in Mulan. Mulan has a potential satire about Chinese culture when it's indicated with superstitious and not very pragmatic beliefs like faith in ancestors spirits and Chinese dragon.The figures totally look Chinese but they actually look white and the heroine herself is dressed up, to look more beautiful and appealing,using thick make up.The beauty,as Americans are well-known to value, is outstanding for the girls to be accepted in the society high ranks. The very influential parts of the cartoon are the songs which are not in Chinese or in complete Chinese music and the English language with a thick American accent is sure dominant."

It was about as good as Pocahontas, better than Aladdin and Hercules, but not quite as good as The Hunchback, to my opinion. The score was very very poor and not in the least memorable, with the exception of one title, maybe. I really adored the character design (much better than in Hercules), but had the feeling there wasn't very much effort put into creating detailed backgrounds, especially compared to recent non-Disney animated movies like Anastasia. It seems that Disney didn't really think of this film as a grand masterpiece to be remembered for the next few years, but more as a ""Let's do this film, until we can think of something we can REALLY put money into"". I was glad there wasn't that much Americanisation in the film like in Hercules, until I saw the ghosts dancing to disco rhythms... well, you can't have everything, I guess.

Menacing villains, trendy colloquial language, and computer generated animation pervades throughout. There is a cute dragon creature, voiced by Eddie Murphy, traveling with Mulan that provides aid and comic relief. Murphy could have played this role like Robin Williams' genie in ""Aladdin"", but opts for a more humble approach.

","I approached Mulan with some trepidation. Disney had become fairly heavy-handed with the political correctness and I feared that Mulan would take it a step further. But the PC Police kept their nightsticks tucked in their belts on this one. Although there is quite a bit of disrespect for Chinese culture (why is our preference for strong-willed women superior to the ancient Chinese preference for demure women?), it's done with remarkable restraint considering the source.<br/><br/>Mulan is a likable character, and Wen's voice brings tears to your eyes. She, like Belle, risks all to save her father. She isn't simply a brainless, helpless Barbie doll awaiting rescue. Mulan's svelte physique was refreshing as well, after the wasp-waisted Pocahontas and her predecessors.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was the jarring lack of a coherent tone. Characters switch from highly formalized speech to modern slang from sentence to sentence. The soldiers would be warriors one moment and dunderheads the next. We are taken in a twinkling from admiring Mulan's ingenuity in aiming the rocket to cause an avalanche and bury the barbarian hoards to rolling our eyes as a horse laden with a grown woman, a burly man, and a dragon bungee-jump by virtue of a piece of rope tied to an arrow one of them is grasping.<br/><br/>Considering how some animated ""classics"" (All Dogs Go To Heaven comes to mind) are utterly stultifying, Mulan stands out as being watchable.

","It'll be hard not to recommend any movie from the folks at Disney, be it a vintage classic or cartoon minus the recent stinkers. MULAN shows what the Mickey Mouse cartoonists can do with a setting where samurai warriors and concubines rule. It's been practical as always to show off familiar renderings of hand drawn art just as with past animated films, and can remain timeless in years to come. As long as stylish techniques apply the basics (like THE PRINCE OF EGYPT), the flat 2-D cartoon film will stick around longer. Even more, you can notice the 3-D effects that stand out as realistic. How many warriors on galloping horseback can you spot? With this being mentioned, it isn't stunning anymore once you saw THE LION KING for the first time. That one was incredible in detail. The story of our young mistress becoming a bold fighter in disguise to bring back peace and family honor is astounding for a Disney creation, and sounds like a step above previous summer efforts. Still, it's another kid's tale filled with the usual instances of comedy relief and sing-along songs that remain a pure delight by Disney's trademark standards, but remember that grown-ups will appreciate the entertainment too. You can't beat the Magic Kingdom for delivering wholesome quality ""family"" fare. MULAN is another excuse to be satisfied with Disney's tradition of excellence.

","Like most of us have recognized, Disney's animated features became downhill after their remarkable feature, The Lion King. I was pretty disappointed with movies like The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules, which missed the usual joy I got out of animated features from Disney. Mulan is definitely, in my opinion, the best movie since The Lion King. What does Mulan have that all the previous movies don't? For starters, Mulan lacks the Barbie figure from Pocahontas and helpless princess personality from Ariel and Jasmine. Mulan is one tough chick. In the beginning of the movie, we find that Mulan is having trouble becoming a respected bride in order to bring her family honor. It is then that Mulan takes her father's place in the army, going under the name of ""Ping,"" clad in armor with her horse, Khan. In this movie, the heroine's goal is not to win love from a man, but to prove her strength and respect. Along with the movie's breath-taking action, beautiful animation, Chinese scenery, and meaningful plotline, it includes a hilarious and unforgettable cast of characters. There's, of course, Mulan (Ming-na Wen), Mushu (Eddie Murphy), Grandmother Fa (June Foray), Captain Shang (B.D. Wong), Crickee, and Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer). And I couldn't possibly leave out Mulan's ragtag, comical soldier friends, Yao (Harvey Fiersten), Ling (Gedde Watanabe), and Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo), who I just can't get enough of every time I watch Mulan.

","""Mulan"" is one of Disney's last ""hand-drawn"" animated works from before it bought Pixar and started exclusively producing computer-animated films and pre-teen pop starlets. The animation here is certainly nice when compared to Disney's television shows, but like other Disney cartoons from this era (Pocahontas, The Emperor's New Groove) the lines are simple, the colors are a bit flat and the cast seems to be on auto-pilot. Yeah, Mulan isn't a Disney film that I would say was particularly ""inspired"".<br/><br/>The musical numbers by Jerry Goldsmith are pretty droll and even offensive (for instance, the fat Chinese soldier character sings about how his ideal woman would know how to cook beef, chicken and pork; you know, like on a Chinese food menu?). Donny Osmond sings the main theme song for Mulan's training montage. I don't like Osmond, but the song is actually flawed by the weak and tepid songwriting, not the vocal performance. Most of the songs here are memorable because they're so laughably awful. I mean, compared to ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" or ""The Lion King"" the songs here are not even in the same ballpark.<br/><br/>Eddie Murphy isn't laugh-out-loud hilarious, but he's the only saving grace of the film. He voices a sassy supporting role, Mulan's pet dragon and best friend, and is the only entertaining part of the film. He's a little miscast, but is also somehow the only substantial character. For instance, the villains (here it's the Mongolian Horde, ancient China's consistent historical adversary) have such little character depth -- not to mention humanity. I know Disney films paint the world in simplistic shades of good and evil, but good golly... the Mongolians are depicted here as a collective race of monsters! They're given no incentive or individual reason for existence. And I don't recall seeing any female Mongolians either. Their whole depiction is clumsy and comes across as ignorant. Also, it's kind of weird that Mulan falls in love with a tough guy who, well... beats her into shape. <br/><br/>The film's not unwatchable, it's just really mediocre. The use of the CGI makes it clear that Disney was just about finished with their signature (historically significant) hand-drawn animated works. But Mulan comes nowhere close to any of Disney's back catalog. To any parents looking for a good Disney animated film to watch with their kids, go for anything before Pocahontas. Mulan is lackluster in the departments of charm, pacing, songwriting and memorability. <br/><br/>I've heard the more recent animated Disney film ""Lilo & Stitch"" was much better, so maybe I should check that out."

","_Mulan_ might have been a masterpiece at a time when Disney films had strong creative voices behind them, but the film has been badly marred by Disney's current committee-style production process. The film simply can't seem to figure out what it's trying to achieve. It's nominally feminist, but undermines that feminist message with its overuse of male gender stereotypes and regressive ending. It is a musical in format, but features uninspired and forgettable tunes that play only a subordinate role in plot and character development. It attempts to realistically portray war, but stretches the laws of physics and basic concepts of military strategy in a way that only a six-year-old could ignore (Run! It's an army of six Huns!). Finally, it tries to lighten this rather somber mess with a wacky sidekick, but Eddie Murphy's voicing of the dragon is so over-the-top that it destroys what could have been the film's greatest strength -- the mystical, exotic mood created by the sweeping Chinese landscape. _Mulan_ seems to me to be compelling evidence of Disney's schizophrenic 1990s creative philosophy: it tries to be feminist and conventional at the same time, and attempts to deal with issues of war while still being comprehensible to toddlers. The result is a confused mess so full of holes and inconsistencies that older children and adults will find it very difficult to suspend their disbelief."

He is voiced by Eddie Murphy, who is an excellent actor and shows it in this movie.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty well-thought out, but the execution of the plot is somewhat shallow.  Not too much happens within the main conflict, as they train and then go into only two battles.<br/><br/>Mulan is quite a good movie if you can overlook its nasty flaws, which can possibly be disguised by the colorful characters.<br/><br/>The music isn't all that great.

"sharky_55","8","1","2","23 October 2015"," Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns!
","This is one of the excellent animations from the Disney Renaissance that mixes Chinese legend with the typical Hollywood elements, but unlike many animations it weaves them together well. You never really see Mushu as anyone other than the wisecracking Eddie Murphy (just as evident as in Shrek, although it is a little more appropriate there) but he manages to create humour and show that he cares for Mulan in little moments such as the assistance in the training montage. The three stooges in Yao, Ling and Chien-Po provide the other comic relief, and they do it well. How lovable and gentle is the giant Chien-Po? (Beef! Pork! Chicken! Mhmm!) Then there are the elements of Chinese culture that do not overburden the narrative but provide a strong basis for the conflict within Fa Mulan. The idea of saving face means her father is too proud to let a woman take her place in the army, and that same sentiment is seen throughout the society. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is as good as any from the Renaissance. We first get an inkling of how out of place Mulan is in the opening number Honour to Us All, which is a playful percussive piece that uses Asian influenced guzheng and flute to match the physical comedy of Mulan's incompetence in the female domain. That is later backed up by the heartfelt Reflection by Lea Salonga. In Blossoms, it starts off slow and meditative, before the orchestration and fanfare create a powerful moment in the storm where Mulan takes off with armour and sword, aided by the slow but tense beats of the bass. The centrepiece however is the rousing I'll Make a Man Out of You, everyone's favourite Disney song that gets you out of your seat. It is simply impossible to not feel pumped up by this montage; the beat is infectious, the lyrics are ridiculous, the sing-along potential unlimited.<br/><br/>The animation style is simple enough and the art design elegantly creates the Han period. There is a stunning wide shot within the battle scene where Shan Yu charges as a single solitary figure behind the rest of the army amongst the snow, before Mulan creates an avalanche and the scene becomes a literal ocean of flowing snow. I am reminded of the chaotic wildebeest stampede in Lion King only a few years back, and here as well 2D animation becomes 3D, and the scale and theatrics of the entire action piece are spectacular. It is here that Mulan shows her heroics despite her gender, and that also being the cause for her exile. It becomes easy to recognise the bravery and courage of Mulan in such a male dominated society. And just beneath that, there is the little domestic conflict of her parents wanting her to marry off to a suitable match. This was an entirely different era; without Mulan there would be no Merida, no Rapunzel, no Elsa and Anna. <br/><br/>Mulan follows the same sorts of formulas that many kids animation films still follow today, but despite some rather pained humour in some parts (the entire character of Chi-Fu, especially with the accent, is rather embarrassing, and Mushu gets a little weary at times - although the grandma is just absolutely precious), underneath there's a genuine narrative with some pretty important themes going on. And there's always something for the kids to sing along to."

","We are all accustomed to the usual beautiful princess who needs a prince to rescue them; that is not the case for Mulan who proves herself not to be a damsel in distress, but a warrior who saves all of China. She accomplishes this amazing task along with vivid characters and defeats all odds against her. It was not just a film, though, it was an epic depiction based on a true story of Hua Mulan, a real warrior who fought in the invasion of China. The Disney film Mulan captures the timelessness of Ballad of Mulan and reintroduces it in a way that appeals to viewers of all ages, displaying empowerment as a trait all girls can possess, overall an excellent movie with clear cut theme and plot without losing its authenticity. Mulan, released in 1998, was a screenplay written by Robert D. San Souci. Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) was the only child of her ill father Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) and mother Fa Li (Freda Foh Shen), both decent farmers. The story begins with Mulan having a meeting with the matchmaker to find a suitable husband, but Mulan is not as poised and graceful enough to impress the matchmaker and ultimately dismissed and labeled a disgrace. Soon after her father is summoned by the councilman Chi Fu (James Hong) to serve in battle. Chinese culture collects one male from each family, if the father is summoned, a son can volunteer to assume his position; although in this family, there is no son to volunteer. A brave and determined Mulan, afraid to lose her father, decides she is going to take his place disguising herself as his son. Since women cannot participate in war she had the challenge of concealing her identity as well as living up to expectations as a male warrior. Li Shan (B.D Wong) is assigned to train the recruitments for battle. Mulan was not as trained and skilled as most of the males so she was met with challenges. After training was over with Mulan was at the top of her class, and soon her identity was revealed and she was released from the roster. She was a determined warrior she returned leading to victory against Shan Yu with the help of some friends and began her budding romance with Li Shang. In addition to the incredible Disney film, it's not only for the television screen, the story has roots. Mulan is actually based on a real person and a real account in history. Mulan is based on a ballad written anonymously during the Ming Dynasty telling the legend Hua Mulan. There of course are subtle differences in the ballad and film, such as the fact that Hua Mulan was fairly skilled in weapons and combat, overtly Mulan was not. What makes this fact special is the time period (1368 C.E-1644 C.E.) where there were strict roles that men and women should follow, especially in Chinese culture. But Mulan differed all regulation and ultimately became a popular figure in Chinese history. Selflessly she took the place of her father in risk of being exiled, killed, or worse. It inspired me even, not to allow anything to become a hindrance and to continue to be selfless one day it may be recognized as greatness. Needless to say, the ballad sets the movie apart from any other Disney film. Characterization is important in any film, they give it dynamics and set the tone. This is a critical movie, but the tone can be very light hearted given the vivacious characters. Mulan is given an ancestor spirit in the form of a little red dragon named Mushu (Eddie Murphy) he adds a comical twist although he is very wise. The characters were well thought out and given an identity, even the minor characters were complex. Warriors and friends of Mulan's like Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po were supporting characters who, like Li Shang, learned to accept Mulan's motives and forgive her deceit. Then you have the obvious static character like Shan Yu whose ultimate goal was to kill the last of the Chinese warriors. Moreover, the voice behind the characters were all of Asian descent (given very few exceptions), I found that intriguing and it gave the roles even more distinction. Characterization provided in this film gave the story the tone it needed to reach out to the audience, without losing the culture. This film happens to be a family favorite, it's always on the list when binge watching Disney films. After its release it was nominated for an Oscar award, and ranked number 2 in the box office, rightly so. Without bias this film has been underrated, I believe it gives hope to female youth. It gives off a sense of empowerment and bravery over all odds. In this story you do not need a prince to rescue you from a tower guarded by dragons; in this case the dragon was her accomplice and she saved her prince. If you were to ever ask who my favorite Disney ""princess"" is I would tell you Mulan. Although she is not a princess, she has just as much nobility on film and in history."

","I said to myself that I would need to see this Disney cartoon feature again to see why the critics give it four stars, and I'm glad I did and I can agree. Basically this the retelling of a Chinese folktale, seeing the Fa family's only child, tomboy Mulan (Ming-Na) failing to honour and fulfil herself as a worthy bride. Then she hears that the Huns have started to invade China, and her weak father Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) being the only man of the family is being called to fight, so she cuts her hair and takes his armour to go in his stead. Her ancestors send a magical dragon, well, the wrong one, Mushu (Eddie Murphy), to protect her as she enters the Chinese army, pretending to be a man, and slowly proving herself as ""Ping"" to Captain Shang (B.D. Wong). So Mulan and the other soldiers are ready to fight against the Huns, led by ruthless villain Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer), who is determined to take over China and the place of the Emperor(Pat Morita). In the end, even after being found out as a woman, destroying some of the kingdom and a few other little mistakes, the Emperor praises Mulan, and she returns home with honour and the love of her father. Also starring Lea Salonga as Mulan's singing voice, Donny Osmond as Shang's singing voice, Mrs. Doubtfire's Harvey Fierstein as Yao, Miriam Margolyes as Matchmaker and George Takei as First ancestor. The animation is still as good as the classics, the voice casting, especially with Murphy, is well done, and it is a film with a fair amount to enjoy, so a fun animated musical adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Matthew Wilder, David Zippel and Jerry Goldsmith, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Original Score and Best Original Song for ""Reflection"". Very good!"

","When China is attacked by the Huns, the emperor enlists one man from every family to help fight the savage invaders. In order to save her father (the only male in her family) from what would probably be certain death, beautiful Mulan disguises herself as a man and takes his place. Aided by Mushu, a wise-cracking dragon, and a 'lucky' cricket, Mulan learns how to be a soldier, saves the day and still has time to steal the heart of a dashing captain.<br/><br/>Disney's adaptation of the Chinese legend of Mulan is a well animated and entertaining tale, but one that may not appeal to younger children due to its rather slow start and historical setting. Technically the film is superb, with some lovely stylish oriental flourishes to the animation and superb action scenes, but the unmemorable songs are less than impressive and many of the supporting characters lack the 'personality' we have come to expect from recent Disney films.<br/><br/>Although definitely not a 'classic', Mulan is nevertheless still entertaining fare and, let's face it, even a poor Disney movie usually has enough merits to warrant a viewing (unless it's the Black Cauldron or Cars, of course!)."

The animation is uneven: the waving flags are marvelous and must be computer-generated, but the heads of the characters sometimes visibly change shape as they turn left or right. The charging Hun army looks too reminiscent of other CGI scenes and looks cartoony. The character of Mushu (voice by Eddie Murphy) is hilarious but also hilariously miscast. The designs of some characters (The Emperor and Shan-Yu) are grotesque, while other designs (e.g., settings, Mulan's horse) are marvelous. The face of Mulan herself is a crude blank with vividly expressive eyebrows and mouth. The voices of Mulan and her family are very good, the songs are good and the music is magnificent (Jerry Goldsmith). The action scenes are generally exciting while also being laughably illogical.

","This is a nice Disney movie, but in comparison to other movies of Disney not for the eyes or ears. For instance, Pocahontas 1 was a feast for the eyes as well as ears, but the story is in comparison to Mulan uncomplicated. The music in Mulan is by no means bad, I think partly because the music and songs were in Mulan more driven by the emotions, and I liked that very much. Especially the music in the transformation scene, in which Mulan disguises herself as a boy, I thought, was very well. <br/><br/>I like it also that the story was set in ancient China, I don't know very much movies that are set in China. I saw once the Red Lantern and it really made me sick and depressed. I could have of course put the television off, but that time, I was forced to follow a school course about China, and I wanted not only through books and writing papers to learn more about China. This seems not to have helped me: I managed to get from all the students who were following the course too, to get the lowest grade as possible. Some interesting things I have learned from my course was that due to superstition about number 4 (in Western culture it is 13) many buildings do not have 4th floors. The most interesting thing for me was however: China is eternal, but the lives of the Chinese are often hard and short. This kind of feeling is very evident in Mulan, but at the same times this movie, of course in most animated movies, has humour. A tiny dragon takes care of that. <br/><br/>The movie did leave me 2 times in almost opposite emotions. I was laughing about the song, which was dealing about women, and the next moment the soldiers stepped in a solitary battlefield. Also when Mulan saved the live of her leader Cheng, and the other moment only a matter of a few minutes later I really thought that (although it is Disney) Cheng would kill her.<br/><br/>The ending did not satisfy me. I think it would have been better, if the movie stopped when Mushu hugged Mulan after he has promised that things will be alright, after the army has left Mulan, or when Mulan gets on her horse to ride to home. But then this kind of ending is maybe only suitable for people who value 'joining' more important as 'winning'. But then again, although they were loyal, I did not care about Mulans parents and her great grandmother and especially not the ancestors."

","Mulan is just about Disney's last really good 'classically animated' style movie (at the time of writing). The whole thing has a pleasing, mildly intoxicating atmosphere to it. There are scenes of considerable emotional impact, mixed with sufficient comedy and adventure, and some really nice landscape shots. Eddie Murphy, though slightly annoying as the salamander-thing, has not at this stage developed into the outright annoying animated voice-over artist which would come with Shrek.<br/><br/>The film could have strayed into irritating political correctness (G.I. Jane in Ancient China), but it pretty much manages to avoid this. If you can put up with the silly American accents used for Chinese characters, I'd recommend Mulan. Particularly in a visual sense, it has the feeling of a traditional oriental painting at times. <br/><br/>I'd sooner watch this than anything by Disney I've seen since (though nearly most of them have been at least alright)"

","Although I bypassed this film in the theaters, I took a chance and purchased it for my Disney movie collection (a strategy which served me admirably with The Rescuers Down Under and miserably with Pocahontas!).<br/><br/>""Mulan"" is the powerful story of a headstrong and ambitious teenage girl in medieval China who, in an effort to save her ailing father, impersonates a man in the Chinese army, repels a Hun invasion, and falls for her commanding officer.  She is aided in her adventures by a comical dragon named Mushu, a lucky (or is it unlucky?) cricket, and three wise-cracking compatriots at arms.<br/><br/>The Disney formula works remarkably well here (though the love story angle is a bit of a stretch).  Mulan is a likable and gutsy representation of grrrrrl power in a predominately male society. Her outspoken nature and penchant to think and take action when necessary are in direct contrast to the normal feminine roles in the ancient world. Voluminous supporting players require more-than-average attention span by the viewer, but then this is an epic war story!  And each of these characters is given their moment to shine, while never fully taking the reins from the true heroine.<br/><br/>The lessons of tolerance and empowerment for young girls are blatantly obvious, but they do not detract from what is a terrific and moving story. As in any good Disney animated adventure, the music plays a big part, and some of the songs stick with you long after the end credits run. The animation is incredibly fluid and evocative of the oriental setting, and some of the special effects are a wonder to behold. The training sequences and mountain battle scenes are brilliant examples of the craft.<br/><br/>The vocal cast is an international potpourri of talent, including Pat Morita, Harvey Fierstein (as a REAL man's man!  Go figure!), June Foray, George Takei, and Eddie Murphy (hilarious as fast-talking dragon, Mushu). The dialog is rapid-fire and intelligent for adults, but easy enough for older children to grasp.  Donny Osmond's song for the training sequence (""I'll Make a Man Out of You"") is a thunderous and inspirational war ballad that still rings in my ears - particularly when I am working out or have a heavy job to accomplish.  Also, listen carefully to the music for the closing of the film: No less talent than 98 Degrees, Stevie Wonder, and Christina Aguilera (before her genie ever came out of its bottle)!<br/><br/>There are a few small flaws in logic (i.e., The rescue of Mulan and her horse during the avalanche - While Mulan may be a fierce and powerful warrior, I don't think even HER legs could hold up that horse!), and some of the humor may sail past younger viewers (cross-dressing gags, suggested nudity and jokes about the hygenic habits of men, to name a few...). Still, the multitude of characters, snappy dialog, and various levels of action and adventure make this film as much fun on the twentieth viewing as on the first.<br/><br/>""Mulan"" is highly entertaining kids and adults equally (My 3-year-old son requests this one regularly!).  And this is a ""chick flick"" for guys, too! Get some takeout Chinese and make a night of it with the kids... or with that special someone in your life."

Ever since I was a kid, (I'm a big one now at 27)I've pretty much caught all of the Disney movies and as you get older they obviously change. Not the movies themselves, but your perception of what you are watching. As a movie fan I can appreciate all of Disneys recent movies as an adult( the direction, artwork, character selection and most importantly story selection). I like them all in different ways, Aladdin for X, Notre Dame for Y and it goes on. The point I am making is this: Does it really matter what I think? My daughter loved it. Its for her. Its for all the kids to enjoy the world over. I try not to be critical of Imbd reviews but I think people maybe aren't watching a movie like this in the right frame of mind if they are not at least entertained by its simple (ok predictable) story and the easy to listen to musical score etc. As an Eddie murphy fan I loved mushu, but I can appreciate someone not acquainted with his comedy finding him miscast in this film. But again, so what? Do the kids care? No. As adults we criticize the selection of the comedy relief and we wonder who the comedy relief will be in the next film. I'm not saying you have to have children to enjoy a Disney movie nor am I saying any person young or old, male or female, chinese or arabic etc isn't entitled to an opinion on said movie, but hey  lighten up folks.

","Disney's most recent animated film contains fewer of the crowd-pleasing elements that made ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Lion King"" into box-office bonanzas (although there is a tiny dragon, Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy, and a horrifyingly cute roly-poly dog does make a mercifully brief appearance early on).  Instead, ""Mulan"" tells a surprisingly mature story through beautiful animation in the classic style.  From lush gardens to stark snowscapes to ornate temples, the settings frame and complement the storyline beautifully.  When her father is injured and unable to represent his family in the emperor's army, Mulan disguises herself as a boy and rides forth to take his place and defend her family's honor.  Disney has released a series of animated films with strong heroines (""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Pocahontas""), and ""Mulan"" continues the trend. (One might wonder at Disney's agenda; the only central male character in a recent animated Disney film [""The Lion King""] is not human.)  Mulan's cross-dressing adventures are fascinating enough to engross child and adult alike (in the end, she manages to include her faithful soldier sidekicks in the joke), and Shan-Yu, the leader of the Huns, is as wicked a villain as anyone has a right to hope for.  It all comes to a fine, satisfying conclusion, and the story's emphasis on the value of family relationships makes for a worthwhile shared experience."
"AD-7","9","1","2","2 December 1998"," Disney has gone bananas !
","What a miracle : I didn't need one single Kleenex during a Disney movie. After the already 'different' Hercules, Disney now brings us Mulan, a story based on a Chinese poem. You might have thought that it would turn out to be very serious, but really, this is the funniest Disney-movie I've ever seen. But, technically, I think (to my humble opinion Mr.Disney), the movie is not so good. I know that the studios often change styles the last couple of years (like in Hercules, which was also technically very good), but this style didn't pleased me at all. Maybe they tried to imitate the cheap Chinese/Korean/Japanese productions that we often see on tv. (no, it wasn't THAT bad). I always use 'The Sleeping Beauty' from Disney as a reference to technical perfection, as that is the best Disney movie in my opinion. It is not possible to classify Mulan between the other 'Disneys', but it was superb, with Disney displaying drag queens etc. Is this film banned in Texas ?"
"micklest","4","4","18","28 June 1999"," An unfortunate disappointment
","With all the wealth of Chinese art and history to draw upon, Mulan, in its visual style, looks like 1950s Disney: bland, slick, and bright.  Only the opening title gives any hint of rich beauty of Asian art.  Closer attention to traditional silk painting, scrolls, screens, etc. might have helped lift this one a notch.<br/><br/>As it is, its manner of storytelling is only a b-level imitation of other Disney flicks of the late '80s and 'early '90s.  Standard stuff, though Eddie Murphy provides a little (very little) relief.<br/><br/>Still, Asian-American kids might (MIGHT) get a kick out of seeing one of their most revered cultural legends come to life onscreen.

"TxMike","Null","2","7","24 November 2002"," Good Disney animation, funny in spots, rating seems a bit too high.
","I like good animated films. Disney's ""Tarzan"" is one of my favorites. I also like ""Shrek"", ""A Bug's Life"", and ""Monsters Inc.""  To me ""Mulan"" doesn't quite make that grade. Everyone knows the story by now - young girl Mulan disguises herself as a young man and reports to fight the Huns instead of her ailing father, and becomes a hero. I felt some of the silly characters, and the ""spirits"", were making fun of the Chinese.  And, while Eddie Murphy's character, the midget dragon, was funny, it was too much like the talking donkey in ""Shrek."" <br/><br/>The high points -- the film was only about 75 minutes long, the animation was really good, the picture on DVD is very sharp and colorful, the Dolby 5.1 surround sound is used to good effect.

","The movie I will admit attempted a good story line.  Mulan was a character that was well developed and she showed courage and strength. The army leader and eventual lover of Mulan was good but he wasn't very military like/Japanese like in his singing.  Would you really expect Donny Osmond to sound like a strong japanese warrior.  This movie was overall OK but there was no musical number that was especially moving even though Lea Salonga's voice showed much potential,  she only sang one small solo). The lizard resembled a pale imitation to Aladdin's genie,  Mulan resembled Pocahontas in her ethnic courage for peace and dignity,  and the military leader seemed like an honorable Pheobus--not very emotional(or loving) but a fairly good performance.  However,  in general the movie's supporting cast was weak,  not very catchy music,  the story line wasn't especially interesting,   there was no funny moments really, and overall Disney's other films are better.   Try The Hunchback for Notre Dame for serious interesting and moving Disney performances,  or Beauty and the Beast.

","This review is an attempt to explain some reasons why this movie is considered not one of Disney's greatest films.<br/><br/>In short, the art is beautiful in its own way and the voices aren't bad. But the lack of sound (background noises, music, sound effects, etc) except for in select parts where a musical number popped in was devastating to the mood of the picture.<br/><br/>Sound moves the film and at times it became boring, even when Eddie Murphy was blasting out some silliness that should have been entertaining.<br/><br/>Also the music numbers seemed uninspired and randomly placed. Instead of moving the picture and complimenting it, they seemed to be begrudgingly thrown in like tinsel on a Christmas tree- no one likes it, yet many just toss it on in a strange sense of obligation.<br/><br/>The art was definitely good and the animation fluid. Sometimes the backdrops were so simple that it almost felt like one was watching an animated storyboard instead of the final product."
"Iria","4","3","16","18 October 1999"," It was okay...
","The animation wasn't terribly impressive; at times, it seemed too simplistic, with the quality of shading and attention to detail falling drastically short of say, for example, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.  In addition, I felt that Disney was trying to stereotype and ""play into"" the Chinese culture too much by trying to imitate Chinese music in some of the soundtracks (which, I might add, weren't that great either. Only ""Reflections"" I shall acknowledge as being somewhat enjoyable). Mulan's character design is a stereotype in itself.  Since when do Asians really have eyes that tilt at almost a 45 degree angle?  I realize it might seem like a little thing to get so excited over, but I'm Asian, so I am sensitive to details like that simply because I have been the target of many jokes of that ilk during my adolescence.  I also think that Mulan is the most flat-chested Disney human female I've ever seen.  Pocahontas, who, historically, was 13 when Smith ""discovered"" her, was stacked.  Of course, there's no stereotype about flat-chested Asians, right (which is entirely a grossly incorrect generalization).  Now all I can say is, ""Gee, thanks, Disney.""  I suppose that some credit should be given, because usually a giant corporation will not take risks by exploring a minority group.  Yet in doing so, they have only played upon the American society's expectations of what Asian culture means to them, but doesn't necessarily reflect the truth.<br/><br/>At face value, however, Mulan was entertaining enough.  Granted, this film is supposed to be for little kids, so hey, why not give some of the music a Chinesy feel to make it all cute.  Why not paint Mulan's face entirely white (even though that extent of make-up is used, NOT for matchmaking, but most commonly for Chinese opera).  Let's give the public something familiar, but at the same make it seem exotic and make it appear like we really *heh heh* want to explore Chinese tradition for its inherent value, and not to exploit it for our purposes.  Mulan is something I'll watch when I have absolutely nothing better to do.  Even then, I don't think I'd watch it more than two times.  In the words of a previous reviewer, ""Excuse me, I have to go watch some Anime now.""  Go watch Neon Genesis Evangelion."

","I own the video and have watched it numerous times.  I really like this film because mostly because of it's theme and some key scenes that are very moving.<br/><br/>What's frustrating about Mulan is that it's a really good movie whose potential greatness is forfeited to the commercial imperative of mass audience appeal.<br/><br/>Dramas employ light comic relief release tension.  Comedies employ a smattering of drama to move the story along.  Mulan tries to indulge both to a degree of contrast that is detrimental to its primary genre: drama.<br/><br/>
The themes of honor and search for one's destiny are very well explored through the adventures of the heroine Mulan.  The greatest moments in this film are when we see the courage of a young woman facing the dangers imposed both by cultural paradigm and warfare.  We admire her more for dealing with both at the same time.<br/><br/>The problem is that too many moments are ruined with a comedic tag and the film's dramatic pace is often interrupted by obligatory slapstick comedy. I honestly don't think this was necessary.  Children appreciate the story and don't need to be pandered to with incongruous comedy.<br/><br/>Still, the power of the story itself and the crafting of the main characters manage to stand out and hold their own despite the self-imposed comedic distractions.  If the writers had given their own story the respect it deserves, this would have been a great film."

A friend of mine suggested that the character may have been better silent or as a ghost that Mulan could only see.

Moana, Coco and Ratatouille left me with an unexpected sense of joy. Stylish stories with a quiet moral woven into the back ground.
Mulan, though set in China, feels like a cheap Chinese restaurant in California. If you are making a film set in a foreign culture? You should do your leg work and get the feel right. Simply putting the family name first on a character and making some assumptions about honour does not cut it for Chinese. This movie felt like a good B grade western with a thin Chinese theme pasted over the top.
Then there's the message. The movie is obviously trying to put a woman up as a heroine. A ""lady triumphs and wins the respect of the men"" happy ending story. But really the only message here, is that if you're a woman and want to be judged as an equal, you need to be as good as three men to even stand a chance.

","Mulan Worldview Analysis 
In the Disney movie Mulan, the hero is in fact named Fa Mulan. Her goal at first is to give her family honor by being able to be matched with a good husband. When that plan doesn't work out, she then comes back home to find out her father is having to be sent off to war to fight the Hun army. Her goal then shifts to taking her father's place in the army by disguising herself as a boy and bringing her family honor in that way. That fact that she is a woman in the army disguising herself as a man is her character flaw because it eventually leads to her ""apparent defeat."" The apparent defeat happens after fighting the Huns and the main adversary, Shan Yu. She is discovered as being a woman after being injured in battle and is left there for dead by her love interest, and the general, Li Shang. After you think all is lost, her and her guardian from the ancestors named Mushu, discover that the Huns are planning to attack the emperor of China. She rushes down to China, as a woman now, and is faced with the final confrontation with Shan Yu and after an intense battle, she defeats him. The revelation of the hero is that even though she is a woman, she is just as tough as any other man in the army. The whole country sees that as well and bows down to her in the end. In conclusion, the moral of this movie is that women are just as strong as men and possibly even stronger. A woman can do anything a man can do and this movie teaches equality of the sexes. 
The movie gave a lot of supporting evidence to prove the moral of the story. At first, when she goes off to war disguised as a guy, she is stumbling around and can't fight very well. After training though she becomes one of the best warriors in their group and even saves Li Shang from his down death. She also defeats the Hun's leader Shan Yu and saves China which proves a woman can do anything a man can do. I agree with this message and I wouldn't do anything different, I think they prove that point very well. Also, I believe this movie ultimately celebrates goodness in the end because Mulan realizes women are just as powerful as men and she is liberated. Another way this movie celebrates goodness is she is the hero and defeats the evil Huns who are killing people. 
In this movie, I don't believe Christianity is expressed very much, if at all. I think this movie depicts more Chinese traditions and religions through the use of praying to ancestors, several mentions of meditation, and defending family honor. The ancestors, though, are the main thing I want to focus on as an example. Not only do they pray to the ancestors for help and guidance, but we also see the ancestors come to life. They actually also end up sending a guardian named Mushu to go and protect Mulan. I think this is saying that the way we should live and the human condition is that we should look to our ancestors for help and guidance. The movie is saying our ancestors will ultimately be there to protect us even when they have passed on to the afterlife. This does not agree with the Bible because the Bible says that Jesus is ultimately the one who can save and guide us through our life by praying to him alone. 
The redemption revealed in this movie is that Mulan finally gets to be comfortable in her own skin. She fights with the guys as her true self and gets to be liberated in the fact that she is just a tough as the guys. I think it completely departs from biblical truth because biblical redemption is accepting Jesus as your Lord and Savior and being baptized to be born again. Even though this is true, I think this movie's message is a positive element of this movie. This movie is empowering to women and a good lesson to teach little girls that they don't have to feel less than any man. It is also positive to have the message to have people feel comfortable in their own skin. I think some negative elements of this movie are the sexism that is portrayed in the movie and the religion depicted not being Christian. If you think about it, if she was a woman who couldn't fight at all and hid as a boy in the military only to get caught, she would have died for sure. Despite this, in conclusion, I believe you can recommend this movie to all ages because it is a very funny and quality Disney movie."

"tieman64","Null","0","1","3 September 2012"," Mephisto in Onyx
","Tony Bancroft directs ""Mulan"", an animated musical produced by Walt Disney studios and hailed by its makers as the first ""feminist"" Disney film. The plot? In dynastic China, a young girl named Mulan assumes the identity of a man in order to fight in the Emperor's army against marauding Huns. Mulan is portrayed as a budding feminist, a spunky young woman who abhors rigid gender roles, fights against sexism and believes that women should be celebrated for their brains and brawn rather than their bodies, bodices and/or domestic/sexual duties. In this regard she puts on pants, grabs a sword, slays barbarians and saves the lives of several men, most notably the Emperor of China. Significantly, in her final showdown with a muscular Hun, Mulan (and her male comrades) wears a dress. Her sidekicks are a lucky insect and a pint sized dragon, both creatures who, like Mulan, are underestimated and forced to conform to the rigid preconceptions of others. Like most supposedly ""progressive"" or ""feminist"" films, female empowerment here boils down to women proving that they can be as violent, barbaric, base and hyper-masculinist as men. This is not feminism, as conflict exists where none should.<br/><br/>The film's intent and content clash in other ways: Mulan's supposedly ""feminist"" actions ultimately stem out of a duty toward her father (and his duties to the Emperor), idealised male and female bodies discriminate against anything less than ideal (almost everyone other than Mulan and her lover is a buffoon), the film is packed with stereotypes, portrays Mulan's victory as a victory of Western ideals over those thought to be more traditionally Chinese, is resolutely white, in real life the Emperors of China were as brutal as any Hun, and the early dynasties were themselves as sexist to men as they were women (hordes of men were castrated and made eunuchs to fulfil specific ""effeminate"" roles in dynastic politics). The film is less sexist and racially insensitive than is typical of Disney, but still grates.<br/><br/>Disney has a history of taking stories from different cultures and sanitising them of anything ""too ethnic"". Here the film is based on the legend or ballad of Hua Mulan. The character has been ascribed to different dynastic periods (Sui, Tang, Ming etc), but Disney instead opted to set their film during the Han Dynasty. This allows the filmmakers to get away with creating a ""nice Emperor"" (China was somewhat progressive during this period) and use a type of ""Han Dynasty iconography"" that resembles more traditionally Japanese iconography (rose petals, samurai attire etc), which perhaps plays well to geographically confused Western audiences. The date of the movie is odd, the film conflating events and invasions that took place in different dynasties (bizzarely, its emperor, Zhou, and chief warrior, Shang, are named after separate dynastic periods).<br/><br/>The film banalizes totems which mainstream culture oft associates with ""oriental"" or ""asian"" cultures. So we have lots of bamboo, dragon statues, great walls, plum blossoms, Chinese gardens, kung-fu, Chinese lanterns, Chinese fireworks, chopsticks, ink brushes, Chinese hair combs, pandas etc. It's wonderfully drawn, but all feels like the result of a corporate brainstorming session. As with most Disney films, anything remotely alien, alienating, hostile or strange is made to seem resolutely familiar and/or cleansed of all cultural and racial background.<br/><br/>""Mulan"", the first Disney ""princess"" with a body count, would lead to a period in which Disney made a greater effort to target male audience members. She, and the princess of ""Tangled"", seem to mark a change in Disney princess body-types (younger, less ""womanly"", less curvaceous, more spunky and ""teenage""; the new sexual ideal). The film is wonderfully animated, very cool, some of its animation work has a primal quality, reminiscent of Ralph Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"", only more abstract, and at times resembles minimalist Chinese ink paintings.

","Mulan is very well animated, very well written, and very well done. I want so much to give this a 10, but there is a few flaws that take away so much from it. First is the character Mushu. If they had made this without any Mushu this would have been a 10, but he is there. He takes away a lot of drama from the movie. In ""The Hunchback"" there was a comedic gargoyle character that took away a lot of drama, but he didn't take up a lot of screen time. Mushu has a lot of screen time to soak up a very large amount of drama, and he isn't even funny. I really wish they took this a little more seriously. Another flaw is Mulan's man voice that is painfully awkward. Although it isn't in the film as much as Mushu so it isn't very bad. Then there is the romance of Mulan and Shang. With other Disney films the romance is needed for the film. With this film we don't need a romance. This film is supposed to be inspiring girls to be who they want to be not just ""girls"", but Mulan ends up falling in love with someone just like every other Disney female. Despite these flaws I really like this movie. It just had so much going for it, and it fell short of what it could have been.<br/><br/>3 and a 1/2 stars out of 4"

","During the 1990's, it seemed that every year or so The Walt Disney Company would come out with a new animated masterpiece. After the breathtaking ""The Lion King"" in 1995, the quality of the films decreased, with ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" ""Hercules,"" and, their worst feature (although ""worst"" is a relative term), ""Pocahantas."" With ""Mulan,"" that trend was reversed (though the legacy of hand-drawn animation came to an end with the dawning of Pixar), at least temporarily (I haven't seen ""Home on the Range,"" though it bombed at the box-office, ending the legacy).<br/><br/>While ""Mulan"" may have reversed the trend, it fails to match up with Disney's undisputed masterpieces. That being said, it comes close. The animation is astonishing (though the human figures are not as beautifully rendered as in ""Beauty and the Beast""). It features a number of standout songs, and a few hilarious sequences. The voice characterizations are solid, with Disney making the right decision to use voices that work the best, and not those who are the most famous. The villain is vicious, but doesn't top ""Aladdin's"" Jafar. In short, ""Mulan"" is very good, but not the best.<br/><br/>During Imperial China, the villainous Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army of Huns has crossed the Great Wall of China and is moving towards the Forbidden City, destroying everything in their path. The Emperor (Pat Morita) orders that one man from every family must serve in the army against Shan-Yu. This poses a problem for the Fa family. They don't have any sons, which leaves the ailing patriarch, Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) to serve. However, his daughter Mulan (Ming-Na/Lea Salonga) knows that he cannot fight, so she poses as a boy and goes in his place.<br/><br/>""Mulan"" covers a lot of issues, none of which are taken TOO seriously: cross-dressing (how neither the MPAA nor the social conservatives have a fit about this being in a family movie is beyond me), honor (not quite taken to a stereotype), feminism, conscription, the nature of identity, and so on. Nevertheless, neither the script nor the directors have any intention of pushing some sort of agenda with these ideas. The only reason why any of these issues are addressed is to tell the story, and that's why this film succeeds.<br/><br/>Of all the Disney heroines, Mulan may be the most three-dimensional. She's not the first girl not to be lady-like (that would be Belle from ""Beauty and the Beast""), but she has the most depth. Mulan is more of a tomboy than anything, and that makes her a very interesting character. This is taken seriously (she will be executed if she is caught), and it's also taken for laughs (whenever she tries to act ""manly,"" and a disastrous encounter with the Matchmaker (Miriam Margolyes), which is nothing short of hilarious).<br/><br/>The other character that has to be mentioned is Mushu, who is voiced by Eddie Murhpy. A failed guardian, Mushu is demoted to waking up the ancestors and the guardians. After a catastrophe, Mushu finds himself in a peculiar position: if he succeeds in getting Mulan home safely, he may be able to become a guardian again. Internet film critic James Berardinelli likened Mushu to Robin Williams' Genie in ""Aladdin."" While I see the resemblance, I prefer the Genie to Mushu, if only because Williams improvised his lines to better effect. Still, Murphy does great work, and he has a number of hilarious one-liners.<br/><br/>There are other great smaller characters as well. The wordless cricket has some great scenes with other characters. The tiny but outrageous Grandmother Fa (June Foray/Marni Nixon) has some hysterical scenes as well. And the three soldiers who become Mulan's friends, Ling (Gedde Watanabe), Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo), and Yao (Harvey Fierstien) serve as more comic relief.<br/><br/>""Mulan"" has some problems. Some of the dialogue could have been rewritten, and the difference between Mulan's speaking voice and her singing voice is immediately noticeable. Most noticeable of all is the rather plain look of the people. Disney has a way of drawing the human figures to fit the culture it is portraying (like in ""Hercules"" and ""Pocahantas""). ""Mulan"" is no different, but more work should have gone into them.<br/><br/>As it is, though, ""Mulan"" is a lot of fun for both kids and adults."

","I groaned when my daughter picked this out: another saccharine love story.

There are light-hearted slapstick antics that will make the kids laugh and a foolish song. Then it turns dark and I became slack-jaw, at the scenes of a village massacre aftermath and a fierce battle, with surprises. The eye-popping battle never gets old.<br/><br/>Mulan is a tough, quick-thinking fighter, a genuine hero. Her heroism is something every parent wants from their daughter.<br/><br/>This movie is the answer to and atonement for the many second-tier Cinderella movies from Disney.

","By this point in Disney's post-'Mermaid' history, they felt they had a grip on culture with their colorful-yet-pointless musicals.  Remember, it's because we accepted all this lard that we now love 'Shrek'.  If society had rejected this at its roots, our green ogre friend would never have existed (or spawned a sequel).<br/><br/>So, once again, Disney does its usual work in the design and marketing phases and lets our minds do the rest.  Interestingly enough, this is  a bridge between Phases III and IV for the studio.  Pixar recovered from 'Bug's Life' with 'Toy Story 2' and within two years<br/><br/>Disney loves itself and lovingly sticks to its prefabricated formulas. Think of it, when was the last time a Disney cartoon tried taking risks? The last one that comes to mind would have to be 'The Black Cauldron'.  Too bad that same attitude doesn't translate here, nothing remotely objectionable can be shown.  In some respects, George Lucas should be running Disney since the two of them think alike (look at the extended version of 'Jedi' and the 'Star Wars' prequels if you don't believe me).<br/><br/>So what do we have here?  Militarism, snobby chauvinism, holier-than-thou sexism, and a frozen camera.  That's why Disney hired Jerry Goldsmith to do the music, he caught on to the 'Rambo' course this movie was taking, so he inserted some of those cues into his score.  Just listen.  The same thing happened with Klaus and Zimmer on 'Pirates', they used their 'Gladiator' work again.<br/><br/>Look elsewhere for an interesting Disney ride, you won't find it here.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud"

","I do love Mulan, but I do not rank it up with what I call the four new classics (the Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Hercules...yes you did read that right). Instead it ranks the next level down, along with Tarzan (another movie I loved but that had some annoyances in it I just couldn't ignore).<br/><br/>This is a great movie with several good songs (Reflection being one of them...it is quite beautiful) but one of the problems is that there were NOT enough of them! The songs that are there are great, but there are so few that it just doesn't do the movie justice.<br/><br/>Although the movie overall is wonderful, and well well worth watching, there are two scenes that stand out from it as, in my opinion, spectacular. These are SPOILERS: the transformation scene where Mulan disguises herself as a boy (the background music and pouring rain in this scene make it simply breathtaking) and the final scene in China, which brings me to tears every time I see it. <br/><br/>The only reason I do not rank this movie with what I call the fab four, is the very end, which is one of the weaker endings I have seen in a Disney movie. With such a strong story throughout the ending seemed to be simply thrown on at the last minute. While I understand that the romance aspect did not really work with this movie, surely they could have done something slightly better than (and I quote) 'would you like to stay forever?"" I mean please! Even if it were Mulan who says this line it would make it better.<br/><br/>
Other than the ending though, and the fact that there simply are not enough songs, this is a wonderful movie that will make a great addition to any Disney collection."

","Two of the key ingredients of a good Disney movie are a good musical score and villain.  Both are completely lacking here.  Most songs are painful to listen to and don't work together to create a cohesive sound for the film (ie. the tribal beats of Lion King or the more tropical feel of The Little Mermaid).  Only Reflection lives up to the Disney standard.  In fact, the only song that has a distinctly Asian flavor is the worst of the bunch. And then we have our villain - who does nothing but glare and grunt.  Not quite as appealing as Scar or Ursula or Maleficent or any of the wonderful Disney villains.  Sure the film has a great message but I've seen better films with the very same one.  It certainly isn't better than The Lion King.  Maybe if they played it straight without the cheesy songs it may have been better or at least better-written ones with a more exotic sound befitting the locale."

This time it's 12th century China and wild-eyed loon Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer), the ruthless leader of the Huns, has started to invade all and sundry. The Emperor (Pat Morita) makes a law stating that one man from each family in China must serve in the Imperial Army, and dispatches his snarky assistant Chi Fu (James Hong) with the words: ""One man may be the difference between victory and defeat.""<br/><br/>Cue our heroine. Her pa, an old war veteran, can't quite cut it against evil Shan-You and his ugly cronies. So, enter clumsy daughter, Mulan (Ming-Na Wen), who takes up arms, pretends to be a geezer, changes her name to Ping (better than Pong), falls for a dashing captain and wins the hearts of the nation. All, as Phil Collins would wail, against the odds.<br/><br/>Mulan has more than a passing similarity to the animated Magic Sword released this summer, but it's not as witty and the songs are even worse. We are spared the statutory farmyard animals, hens, pigs et al singing along with the pretty heroine a la Beauty and The Beast. However, we are subjected to some of the dreariest array of saccharine-coated drivel this side of Boyzone. Beginning with the mournful I Will Never Pass For A Perfect Bride, a quasi Circle of Life lament that even Sir John would balk at, matters descend so rapidly that even Donny Osmond (who last featured in the turgid 1982 TV movie The Wild Women of Chastity Gulch) turns up warbling for the one-dimensional hero, Shang (B.D. Wong).<br/><br/>So, what are we left with? Well, plenty of cowboy references. Mulan seems to have been brought up in what appears to be a Chinese Dodge City, where grandma utters, ""who spit in HER beancurd."" Disney has also thrown in every stock Chinese emblem/symbol they could muster without ever really achieving any notable depth.<br/><br/>The characters are extremely familiar. The idiotic soldiers led by gruff Yao (Fierstein) are reminiscent of the Roman legionnaires in Asterix and work reasonably well. However, the comic moments come courtesy of Eddie Murphy's dragon, Mushu. Reeking of Robin Williams' genie in Aladdin, Murphy obviously receives the best lines: ""Look at those Huns they popped out of the snow like daisies."" Disney will no doubt make a pretty bob out of the marketing of this creature, but it still falls disappointingly short.<br/><br/>What about the actual animation? Well, there's some creepy, mystic, computer generated imagery and magical gimmickry going on, but ultimately there's only one avalanche scene that truly dominates.<br/><br/>Mulan is mildly diverting for adults and cynically appropriate for kids, but it desperately needs a jollier tune. Perhaps, Monty Python's I Like Chinese. Then again, maybe not."
