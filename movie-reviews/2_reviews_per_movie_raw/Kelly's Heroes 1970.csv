"Oro-Indiano","10","44","47","21 March 2000"," Worth its weight in gold.
","Whilst it would make few people's ""All time top ten"" lists, I'm hard pressed to think of a film which is so relentlessly enjoyable as ""Kelly's Heroes"". Part war movie, part comedy, part bank-job caper, the different elements combine seamlessly to produce a distinctive and memorable film.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood, in an unusually subdued but nonetheless commanding performance, plays the leader of a platoon of restless GIs in the chaos of post D-Day France.  When he captures a German officer who just happens to be in possession of a solid gold bar, Clint extracts the necessary information and before you can say ""Three Kings"", he's hatched a plan to make it 30 miles beyond enemy lines to nab the $16 million stash.  He can't do it alone, of course, but has no trouble in convincing his fellow troops that if they're going to be killed in this war, the reward for them should be worth the risk.  Enlisting the help of Quartermaster ""Crapgame"" (Don Rickles) Sergeant ""Big Joe"" (Telly Savalas) and Sherman tank driver ""Oddball"" (Donald Sutherland) among others, Kelly and his platoon of ironic ""heroes"" are soon on their way to an eventual showdown with the German Tiger tank unit guarding the bank...<br/><br/>All too often cross-genre pictures can be let down if the balance isn't right, but that's not the case here because each element is as good as it can be.  The action and battle scenes are well executed, especially that in which Oddball and his Shermans attack a German depot.  The comic relief is genuinely funny rather than cheesy, and includes a beautiful scene at the climax of the movie which gently parodies Clint's spaghetti-western days, complete with the strains of cod-Morricone music.  The suspense is well maintained where necessary, such as the scene where the platoon is caught exposed in the middle of a minefield with a truckload of Germans bearing down on them.  And of course there is the ensemble cast, which is uniformly excellent.  Keep an eye out for a young Harry Dean Stanton, and Len Lesser, who is better known as Uncle Leo in ""Seinfeld"".  Sutherland's proto-hippie (""Always with them negative waves, Moriarty!"") and Carroll O'Connor's manic General  Colt are just two performances which live long in the memory, alongside the ever-reliable Eastwood and Savalas.<br/><br/>There are a few points made about the madness and futility of war if that's what you're looking for.  Allied bombers knock out bridges by day, German mobile engineers rebuild them by night... neither the Americans or the Germans seem to know what's going on or where their lines are supposed to be... behind the lines our heroes are attacked by their own aircraft... General Colt  mistakes Kelly's gold-inspired push for a patriotic determination to end the war, and mobilizes his army to follow him, chastising the staff officers around him for failing to show the same spirit!<br/><br/>But ultimately, this movie is about entertainment rather than political comment.  And as such it is one of the most successful examples of its type, as the almost total absence of negative comments from this page should indicate.  The script by Troy Kennedy Martin (""The Italian Job"") is tight, and direction by Brian G Hutton (""Where Eagles Dare"") equally assured. Perhaps regarded as lightweight in comparison to other, more serious ""men on a mission"" movies such as Robert Aldrich's ""The Dirty Dozen"" or Hutton's aforementioned ""Where Eagles Dare"", the film has nonetheless been influential.  For example, although David O Russell's ""Three Kings"" veers off on a tangent and makes more of a serious comment on the US role in the Gulf War, its matchbook plot (ie that which can be written on the back of a matchbook) is the same as ""Kelly's Heroes"".  And in the speakers mounted on the side of Oddball's tanks, used to blast music at the enemy and freak them out, there is more than a hint of the Wagner-playing helicopters in Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"", still some nine years hence at the time of this film's release.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, therefore, ""Kelly's Heroes"" is a supremely enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.  You will be doing yourself a favour if, next time you get the chance, you take a look.  It's rare that I see a film and don't think at least once that I'd change something about it, but if there is something to change in ""Kelly's Heroes"", I don't know what it is. With that in mind, I give it a...<br/><br/>(10/10)"

","Utterly hilarious World War II adventure picture, with some great acting by all of the leads, fine action sequences and superb scenery.<br/><br/>
Kelly (Clint Eastwood) captures a German colonel (David Hurst), who inadvertently tells him where the Germans are hiding $16,000,000 worth of gold bars. Kelly enlists the aid of his platoon to trek behind the German lines and steal the cash.<br/><br/>The movie features a top-notch cast of veterans and would-be stars. Eastwood (THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY) has a quiet, serious role and floats through the entire picture. Telly Savalas (PANCHO VILLA) makes a great counterpart as the loud, short-tempered and cynical platoon sergeant. Donald Sutherland (THE EAGLE HAS LANDED) steals the show, though, in a very offbeat role as a hippie-style tank commander. He delivers some utterly 60s dialog with great style and is uproarious. Don Rickles is funny, too, in a smaller role as Crapgame - a rear-echelon supply clerk who goes along on the trek for a profit and gets more than he bargains for. Carroll O'Connor (THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE) has an un-necessary but zany role as General Colt, a blustering officer who can't understand why his red-blooded American soldiers aren't cutting through the German army. The role is obviously a knockoff of George C. Scott in PATTON, and O'Connor does an excellent job.<br/><br/>
The supporting cast is fine, too, though not many make much of an impact. Jeff Morris is a hoot as Cowboy, a transplanted Texas hick, with Harry Dean Stanton in support as his sidekick; Stuart Margolin is a jittery radio operator; Len Lesser is a construction officer who gets conned into going along to build a bridge for the guys, and ends getting really screwed over by Kelly's boys; Hal Buckley is the platoon commander who only cares about getting his yacht to Paris; Gene Collins is the baby-faced youngster. David Hurst is lovable as the dim-witted German colonel, and it's really a shame he gets killed - especially by one of his own tanks. Karl Otto Alberty (THE GREAT ESCAPE) has a nice, small role near the end as a Tiger tank commander, and there's an anti-war spin when Kelly and crew let him escape unscathed. Watch for John G. Heller (OPERATION CROSSBOW) as the German patrol leader during the minefield scene.<br/><br/>The movie also features some terrific action scenes. The minefield debacle is suspenseful and nail-biting, and eventually filled with tons of gunfire and neat explosions. The final battle, in which the dozen or so heroes manage to wipe out a garrison of Germans in a small French village is expertly filmed, with some great camerawork and lots of good, convincing special effects. Some major aspects of this sequence were ripped off in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN - Tiger tanks in the street, a sniper in a bell tower, machine gunners firing from bombed-out buildings - the whole general look of the sequence was completely conned.<br/><br/>The Lalo Schiffrin score is light-hearted fun, and Mike Curb Congregation's ""Burning Bridges"" theme is a good song but doesn't at all fit the theme of the movie. The film was shot in Yugoslavia to take advantage of lower production costs. It actually looks a lot like central France, with plenty of hedgerows, bombed out buildings and such - nothing like the mountains and rivers of THE BATTLE OF NERETVA.<br/><br/>I saw this movie on Turner Classic Movies, appropriately letterboxed at about 2.35:1 with hardly a flaw in the print. Colors are accurate and the image is pretty sharp. TNT used to play an awful, orange-looking print of the movie (with the dialog edited to pieces, also) The audio is fine and sounds clear and loud, but the gunfire and explosions lack intensity. The film is also available on DVD.<br/><br/>KELLY'S HEROES is a witty, lighthearted WWII adventure which I don't think any fan can miss. If you need to sit back and watch American GIs kick German butt for 2 and a half hours for a goal as lofty as pure, all-American greed then this is your flick."
"k_rkeplar","Null","86","101","9 August 2004"," A war movie buff's guilty pleasure.
","I'm the first one to rant at ridiculous war movies. The history has to be right, the uniforms, and so on and so on. Plots have to be creditable or I'm the first one to cry foul. But then there comes along movies like Kelly's Heroes. It's violent and meaningless really...but funny and very exciting. The gear is accurate for the most part, which is far more than I can say about the bulk of so called serious war films. Even with the infamous Tiger tank the film makers attempted to at least make the Russian built Yugoslav T53s they were using look like Tigers. I think they were T53s, they did such a good job of making them look like Tigers it's hard to tell. The whole film is a 1960s anti-establishment slant thrown on a pretty standard WWII story about GIs on a mission behind the German lines. In this parallel universe John Wayne type mission, these guys are out for number one. It's their mission, not the US Army's or the Allies. With a headlines crazy General chasing behind them with his photographer looking to pin medals on ""his boys"" for piercing the German lines and apparently leading his ""charge"", they're heading for a town full of Germans guarding a bank with three Tiger tanks. Clint Eastwood has to pick up the means to complete this personal mission along the way without the secret leaking out. We even have 1960s Hippies in this silly war torn 1940s world. Donald Sutherland is a riot as a stoned Sherman tank commander who seems to have stepped into a timewarp and emerged in 1944 and found himself at the helm of an armored unit. Several then unknowns are in the film, including Harry Dean Stanton and Gavin Mcleod. Beautiful scenery and photography shot in what was then Yugoslavia. Excellent attention to equipment detail. Good, if over the top, performances all around. Suspense and excitement. Very funny. And possibly the silliest pothole laden plot to ever pass itself off as a war movie. If you're a war movie buff with a sense of humor you'll love it."

","There will never be a cast of characters brought together for one movie which could compare to this one. Clint Eastwood shows that he can be good at being quite serious, humorous, and even let other people steal scenes without losing presence. The real difference though lies in the rest of the cast which is a group of All-Stars who excel at certain type characters the likes of which you can not find today. Examples: Telly Savalas showing why he would become a MAJOR TV star later, Don Rickles being Don Rickles but keeping his movie character true to the film, Carroll O'Connor showing that greatness was just around the corner for him, and Donald Sutherland is just too good for words. What really makes this movie though is unlike other movies which bring together a lot of big names and top character actors, Kelly's Heroes did not lose focus on the importance of the plot. THe story never gets lost to the characters. Absolutely great job!"
"Nazi_Fighter_David","8","50","59","5 July 2003"," A good deal of humor with explosive action...
","The story is in the funny-macho style of 'The Dirty Dozen', with more emphasis on the fun... The film is set during World War II in post-D-Day France... The plot is a simple one, guaranteeing the minimum of complexity and the maximum of action... <br/><br/>Private Kelly (Eastwood) abducts a German colonel and accidentally discovers the whereabouts of a fortune in gold...<br/><br/>Being less interested in winning the war than in a little self-enrichment, he decides to liberate the hoard privately... <br/><br/>Being unable to take on the Nazi war-machine single-handed, he sees himself obliged to recruit some fellow conspirators... So he takes Telly Savalas, the top skeptical sergeant who initially vetoes the move, but changes his mind when it becomes clear that he cannot stop his men from going; Don Rickles, the hustler who can easily provide any weapon; and Donald Sutherland, the bizarre leader of a Sherman-tank squad, whose life style consists of getting high on drugs and meditating to unorthodox music... Sutherland, in fact, very nearly steals the film in his role of a spaced-out tank commander...<br/><br/>Certain amusing touches stand out in this piece of satire: The blazing battle led by Oddball's tanks, complete with inspiring music; the very suspenseful climax that makes the audience tingle with the fear that the soldiers' plan may fail; the title song, 'Burning Bridges,' which perfectly fits the mood of the film; and the wonderful parody of 'The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly,' with Eastwood and his gangster force advancing on a German tank guarding the gold to the strains of Ennio Morricone's memorable score...<br/><br/>Carroll O'Connor plays the egotist happy general who sees the move as nothing more than a group of dedicated soldiers taking the war into their own hand..."

","Interesting enough, reading through the comments on this film, I noted only one detractor, some sorehead from Canada who completely missed the point of the film.  No, Sr. Canadiense.  This is not a serious film about WW2.  Read some of the excellent commentaries here about the social and temporal context of this film, i.e., the height of the Vietnamese war.  Yes, Sutherland, your fellow countryman, was an active anti-war protester and fully embraced the anachronistic hippie role.  The mad-cap story which tweaks the nose of the ""establishment,"" in this case, the military establishment, is plausible when you let go of the blood, guts and glory of the war film genre. And, it is a damn funny film.  Eastwood is at his clenched jaw, cynical best; Savalas is great as the Sergeant big-guy; Carrol O'Conner is riotious as the general; Rickles is, well, Rickles.  But, Sutherland steals the show.  The scenes where they tanks come out blasting the Germans to the tune of twangy Country-Western music is hilarious. Sutherland's out-of-time-sync ""...no negative vibes... hey, man...yeah, baby..."" is side-splitting.  The final confrontation scene between the three striding up to the German tank commander, with Sutherland loosening his side arm, ala Clint Eastwood in Fist full of Dollars is a riot.   This film is full of funny stuff.  And, you can see it again and again and find new business to laugh about.  Buffs will delight at seeing Harry Dean Stanton in a pre-Repo Man role and Richard Davalos who played James Dean's doomed brother Aron in East of Eden.  This is a great piece of satire that was overlooked, cast aside and has still survived to the delight of those of us who enjoy it again and again.  But, hey, don't just take my word for it.  Of the 30 or so commentaries here-- and do read them, as there are some excellent ones-- only one was a detractor."
"bdenny29","10","72","89","13 July 2004"," Classic and Great
","This movie is simply great. The guy who wrote the other review is flat wrong. He contests that anyone no from the era won't like it. I was born in 1982, and it's in my top 5. It has one of the best casts around, with Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, Donald Sutherland, and Carroll O' Connor. It has action and humor, what more could you want. It is a great film, hands down. Do yourself a favor and view its splendor. The Mike Curb song is great and catchy, the editing is on par with any other movie, and the plot, although improbable, is entertaining. All told, it gets a 9.5/10."
"eaglejet98","Null","99","129","28 November 2003"," Classic comedy; realistic characters, believable props/scenery.
","Kelly's Heroes does not try to trivialize war. It portrays a comedy within the boundaries of war's absurdity. (Quite frankly, I did not like the film MASH because I felt it did try to trivialize war).<br/><br/>What makes Kelly's Heroes a success is that the director never forgot that the point of comedy is to make us laugh. There's no message here; just pure entertainment.<br/><br/>The film is believable because it stretches, but never steps over, the line of plausibility. The story is preposterous, but in the confusion of war we can believe something like this could happen. Those who have served in the military have all met characters like the ones in Kelly's platoon, even Oddball. Yes, Donald Sutherland was clearly cast out of time, from the 60s, but he somehow personified the rebel in all of us, and that spans generations. If anything, Oddball subliminally told us it was okay to view the film from our vantage point of 1970. His character worked. And so did all the others.<br/><br/>On top of that, the filmmaker spent the extra time and expense to insure reasonable technical accuracy. The uniforms were authentic and I was most impressed by the fact that the vehicles and equipment, for both sides, were accurate. (My biggest gripe about 'Patton' was that it used M-41 tanks for both sides, just painted differently).<br/><br/>The structure of the film is excellent. We believe everything is real. The early scene where the platoon is sitting on the side of the road while a seemingly endless convoy of Sherman tanks passes is a perfect example. There may have only been a few tanks but the way they were looped about continuously gave the impression of 'a cast of thousands'. The Yugoslavian backdrop was reflective of WWII Europe.<br/><br/>Watch this film a few times and you'll catch the slight nuances not normally found the first time through. It's classic how seemingly unimportant early events or dialog enhance the humor of later scenes. For example, when Oddball first shows Kelly his tanks he says they have loud speakers to calm their nerves and paint in their shells to scare the Germans. Early Sherman tanks had a low velocity shell that was ineffective against German armor. Later we roar when Kelly catches a Tiger from its vulnerable rear, but Oddball forgets to fire an anti-tank round and instead splatters it with pink paint! The railroad yard attack scene, (which is superbly choreographed, and tactically accurate) becomes absolutely riotous when Oddball's crew plays 'I've been working on the Railroad' after destroying the place and rumbling away.<br/><br/>Don Rickles should have won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Crapgame. He congeals all the other elements and characters in the film.<br/><br/>The parody scene of 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is superb. Like Oddball, its being out of time somehow enhances its own effect.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that Clint Eastwood was a bit disappointed with this film because he was not allowed to give it one more edit before its release. I don't know how on earth he could have improved on it."
"KShrew","10","50","64","6 April 1999"," A different kind of war movie...
","Kelly's Heroes is a difficult movie to describe -- somewhat a cross between a good war movie and a black comedy. The chemistry between Savalas, Eastwood, Rickles, and Sutherland really makes this movie. The combat scenes are some of filmdom's best...close to the Kubrick-directed scenes in Dr. Strangelove."
"tschmid","Null","38","49","26 February 1999"," A two for one movie
","Kelly's Heros brilliantly mixes your average war movie with a bank robbery movie to come up with a plot that's entirely unique.<br/><br/>Equipped with an all-star cast, Clint Eastwood and Telly Savalas play the straight guys to the comic antics of Donald Sutherland and Don Rickles.  The movie makes no moral judgements about bad guys and good guys and simply shows the characters of both sides a path to redemption in the midst of war. In addition, the theme song, ""Burning Bridges"" is rendered with a youthful tone by the Mike Curb Congregation, which reminds us that in reality, people not much removed from childhood are the ones sent into battle.<br/><br/>We cheer when they get their just rewards."

","Is it a war movie? Is it a heist movie? It it an adventure? Is it a comedy? Is it a social commentary? Yes. And all in good fun.<br/><br/>Great cast, excellent action sequences, decent level of war realism. It effectively employs a cynical style of insulting humor that was very mainstream back in the 1970s (remember the Dean Martin celebrity roasts?), along with a war movie style that was also common for that decade.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is great as the lead, but he's the straight man to Telly Savalas and Donald Southerland, who are the real gems in this cast. The rest of the supporting cast is an ensemble of generally good character actors from the 1960s and 1970s, and as a group, they turn in a fine performance.<br/><br/>It's simply a fun movie that should be enjoyed without too critical an eye."
"Mr Blue-4","9","8","9","5 September 2005"," One Of The Best
","I've grown up with this film, thanks to all the times CBS used to run it, and cable channels since then. I never tire of it. A near perfect combination of action and comedy. The film's wisecracking is not only appropriate to the subject matter but to the environment the film found itself made and released in (the height of the Vietnam War).<br/><br/>The turmoil of the Vietnam era casts a shadow on the film, yet at the same time it stands on its own, very much timeless in a way. The one exception being Donald Sutherland's Oddball character, who remains one of the best things about this 1945-era film while his presence screams Woodstock.<br/><br/>Watching it today, it points out a tremendous flaw in TODAY's Hollywood. The casting. ""Kelly's Heroes"" is rich with character actors, who are not only able in firing off lines at each other (Rickles and Savalas particularly) but also in holding the screen in saying nothing. I think every fan of the film knows exactly what I mean and would agree with me that the mentality guiding the production of films today is simply horrific."
"barnabyrudge","7","35","50","8 September 2004"," Under-rated wartime caper.
","Clint Eastwood reunites with his Where Eagles Dare director Brian G. Hutton for another improbable but entertaining WWII caper. Kelly's Heroes has its moments of wartime spectacle and lots of slambang action, but it also has plenty of comedy thrown in. Many critics judged the film quite harshly, groaning about how it is inappropriate for a film to mix jokes and war. But in truth, Kelly's Heroes never pretends to be a serious wartime account - and the humorous undercurrent helps the film rather than hampering it.<br/><br/>A bunch of American GIs are given a few days away from the battlefront during WWII. However, they are not overly impressed with the quiet, excessively peaceful and ""boozeless"" village where they've been told to relax. One member of the group, Kelly (Eastwood), has learned of a fortune in Nazi gold bullion hidden away in a bank in a German-occupied town some thirty or more miles behind enemy lines. He tells the other guys about it, and they decide to risk their lives to get hold of the hoard. Of course, pulling off a bank robbery is no easy task at the best of times, but when the bank is so far into enemy territory......<br/><br/>Eastwood is suitably laid-back here, but the real stars of the show are Telly Savalas (dynamic and hilarious as Big Joe) and Donald Sutherland (a hippy tank driver so chilled-out he's happy to eat cheese, drink wine and sunbathe in the middle of a chaotic battle!) The pyrotechnics are well-orchestrated, and Troy Kennedy Martin invests the script with the kind of amusing banter and thrilling set pieces that he gave to The Italian Job a year earlier. Kelly's Heroes is totally unsubtle and totally removed from reality - but what it lacks in tact it makes up for with spectacular destruction and bags of entertainment."
"garabaldi12","Null","12","15","15 December 2002"," Great Anti-establishment/caper film
","Kelly's Heroes is an exciting World War 2 capers film. The cast led by Eastwood, Sutherland, Rickles and Sevalas create a group of likable, if slightly unorthodox, WW2 GI's who set out to secretly steal 16 million dollars worth of Nazi gold held in a French bank behind enemy lines. The WW2 setting hides the fact that this film is really more of a caper/adventure film than anything else. The film succeedes in captivating and thrilling the audience with it action,while humoring it with its tongue and cheek and irreverent  style. In this way the Kelly's Heroes shares much in common with films like Ocean's 11. To its credit, while Kelly's Heroes is  anti-establishment,it is not some shallow, preachy anti-war film so typical of later films of the 70's and 80's. While it shares some traits of anti-war films(incompetent leadership and wasteful tactics) it doesn't ever really take an over moralizing ""war is hell"" stance. Indeed, while the ""heroes"" do rebel against the ""establishment""(their officers) ,their rebellion is motivated by plunder and personal profit, not because they feel war is morally wrong or unjustified. Likewise while Sutherland's Oddball has many hippie traits as has been pointed out, his tactical skill as a tanker and willingness to kill for profit are hardly ""hippie"" in nature. While the anti-establishment stance of the film is indeed motivated by the time in which it was made(1970), the film could have just as easily been set in any place or time period, with or without a war as a background. The setting of the film in world war 2 however helps the audience immediately elicit sympathy with the main characters(American soldiers), despite the illegal/unauthorized action which they undertake and the neccesarily violent methods which they use to accomplish their task(killing Nazis). Despite this the film's portrayal of world war 2 tactics and equipment are excellent,and gives the film a sense of realism,excitement and seriousness that it wouldn't otherwise have. All in all, Kelly's Heroes one of my favorite heist films and one of the better looks at the irreverent and rebellious side of soldiers in war."
"screenman","9","7","8","24 October 2010"," Heroic Movie
","A great cast of popular stars, are perfectly chosen for their ability to play it tongue-in-cheek. Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland in particular have demonstrated their ability to pitch anything from straight, comic and crazy in other movies.<br/><br/>It's a heist behind enemy lines. There's millions of dollars in gold just waiting for some military enterprise. Clint Eastwood plays a straightlaced GI who decides to turn soldier-of-fortune when he discovers this stash of bullion is inadequately guarded just 30 miles beyond their advance. The post D-day German defences are crumbling, and in the confusion he and his team might just pull-off the perfect crime.<br/><br/>Right from the outset, this is a great action movie. Clint and Telly's outfit find themselves caught-up in fierce combat. There's tremendous pyrotechnics here and what look like real Tiger tanks, not disguised American hardware. It's tense, vigorous and exciting stuff, but with a thread of ironic comedy all the way. Each of the principal characters is simply, but clearly stamped. They're flawed, likable and we care about them - as we should. <br/><br/>Using a couple of 'specimen' gold bars, Eastwood's character co-opts and bribes whatever and whoever he needs to succeed in the caper, inadvertently shortening WW2 in the process.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie there is some of the most splendid wartime action drama in any work of its vintage. Yes; the Germans are slaughtered wholesale as usual - but who cares? There is also one of the most entertaining close-quarter tank encounters of just about any movie - including the epic 'Battle Of The Bulge'. Sutherland's solitary Sherman goes up against 3 Tigers in the confined streets of a French village, employing its manoeuvrability and surprise.<br/><br/>That last conflict is extremely well realised. A surprisingly generous level of base rewards the use of subwoofers, as these roaring dragon-like machines compete in the rural ideal. At the same time, as the ambush is prepared, a simple rhythmical riff gathers instrumental complexity, ratcheting-up the tension in a way that is both simple and effective. The riff doesn't get faster; more instruments are gradually included into the given tempo. A similar trick was employed in 'Henry V' of 1935 vintage. I'm surprised it isn't used more often.<br/><br/>The action is realistic, the humour never jars with the tragedies that befall our heroes, locations are wonderfully evocative - I was convinced that this was shot in France, filming, editing and other technical issues all hit the spot. As a piece of action entertainment - wartime or otherwise - its hard to fault.<br/><br/>You couldn't improve upon this movie even today. For one thing, the players simply don't exist who could fill these collective characters. Neither could the combat scenes be more intense or realistic whilst retaining the comic thread.<br/><br/>In terms of what it has to offer, this movie, then, is very much a one-off. Very highly recommended."

His recruits range from the hard-boiled yet disciplined Big Joe (a great turn by Telly Savalas) and the relentless hustling of Sgt Crapgame (Don Rickles) The platoon start off reluctant and wary of their mission but soon slip easily into being soldiers of fortune as well as warfare and the comradeship is soon apparent as they battle the Germans while trying to find the banks that houses the gold. <br/><br/>This film also has one of the best show-stealing characters in Cinema, the loosest but most lovable of loose cannons; Tank Commander Sgt Oddball (masterful performance by Donald Sutherland) it's well-known he was seriously ill while filming.

Which accounts for Oddball's hippie commune of actual ""flower children""  a species that did not yet exist at the time of this movie's supposed period.<br/><br/>Chief crewman of Oddball's cadre of three Sherman tanks is Moriarty (engine-oiled Gavin MacLeod, long before he captained The Love Boat, here piloting The Love *Tank*), incessantly being accused and mispronounced by Oddball, ""Always with the negative waves, Moriaritty! Always with the negative waves!"" In their quest to pull off the perfect crime, with an actual pot of gold (worth 16 million dollars) at journey's end, Kelly's ""heroes"" inadvertently win battle after battle, carving a swathe of allied territory straight through the heart of German occupation  to the chagrin and delight of General Colt (frenetic Carroll O'Connor), who believes these troops are ploughing patriotically through enemy lines despite the hesitance of their commanders.<br/><br/>Languidly directed by Brian G. Hutton (who also directed the other Eastwood war movie of this era, *Where Eagles Dare*), this movie would have fared better  as a more entertaining diversion and as a better story - if it had concentrated on the aspects which *separated* it from other war movies of its day - the ""heist"" angle and the ""comedy"" - rather than adhering to war movie convention so perfunctorily: machine guns blaze away at every opportunity, mowing down Germans who couldn't hit the side of a barn, with carpet-bombing padding out large segments of screen time. Being a ""war movie,"" Hutton obviously received a fat explosives budget - and by Jerry Bruckheimer he was going to use it! By the time they reach Claremont, Kelly's armada of companies has been whittled down to only his troop and Oddball's one remaining Sherman. Meanwhile, General Colt drives headlong to Claremont to meet up with Kelly's troop, not realizing that if he did, instead of handing out the medals he brings, he'd have to court-martial the lot of them.<br/><br/>After his troop disables two Tigers, Kelly must find a more subtle way to subvert the last remaining Tiger, dug in directly in front of the gold-laden bank.<br/><br/>And Sergio Leone comes to the rescue! In a scene directly spoofing one of Clint's own *Dollar* standoffs, he faces down - across an expanse of dusty street - a Tiger tank. Joined by Sutherland and Savalas, and accompanied by Lalo Schifrin's score emulating one of Ennio Morricone's evocative passages (i.e. close your eyes and you're back in *For A Few Dollars More*), they grimly (yet almost smirking for the audacity of the in-joke) stalk towards the tank, whose occupants silently regard this display of bravado - or temporary insanity. All that's missing are the spurs and ponchos.<br/><br/>From out of the tank steps the commander (Karl-Otto Alberty, oozing such searing Nazi authenticity it's a wonder he wasn't indicted for war-crimes after the film). Kelly's plan: like any good American entrepreneur  to Make A Deal. ""All you have to do to have an equal share in this money is crank that turret around  and blow a hole in that door."" Once again, though other movies may have united Germans and Americans in touching tableaux serving to illustrate the meaninglessness of war, this movie unites them in a decidedly Marxist twist - the proletariat partners in crime united against the capitalistic *bourgeoisie*.<br/><br/>Amidst the French celebrating in the street (thinking they have been liberated), with General Colt mistaken for de Gaulle by the revelers and mobbed before he can discover the decimated bank and American soldiers making off with its loot, Lalo Schifrin's and Mike Curb's strangely nostalgic and immortally memorable theme, *Burning Bridges*, plays out the credits, as Kelly's unlikely heroes load the last of the gold onto their truck and drive off  literally  into the sunset.<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

"tigerman2001","Null","13","17","7 May 2002"," Oh, baby, this mother-beautiful film's loaded with positive waves...
","(** spoilers ahead**)<br/><br/>I didn't see this movie until 15 years or so after its release, but when I was a little kid I heard the ""Burning Bridges"" theme in heavy rotation on the radio and it instantly appealed.  I should have known that the movie would, too, and this is one of those films that I can watch over and over again without tiring.  It seems to be that they really don't make 'em like they used to, and the few years between the late '60s and mid-'70s produced some of the best war-themed (and this would include anti-war) films ever made. Most of them were built around stories that could actually have been told in a similar way in another setting.  This film is an example of that principle, as is ""Catch 22"" and -- though I somehow seem to have managed to miss it thus far, definitely not by design -- ""M*A*S*H*"" (""Apocalypse Now"" is a slightly later example, in that it could have been set in any conflict or, as in the novel from which it drew inspiration, in what passes for peacetime). The cast is great and it's probably that as much as anything that has the power to keep me watching this long film to its conclusion even after multiple viewings.  Pretty much everyone's perfectly cast, and all do a great job with balancing the real nastiness of war (that does intrude now and then) with the more comedic elements that really define the film.  For me, the primary attraction of this movie and its most unforgettable character -- is Oddball, the Sherman tank commander played to perfection by Donald Sutherland in all his hippiesque glory.  Every second that Oddball has on screen is classic, his way-out-ness being all the more exaggerated by contrast with Clint Eastwood's generally stony façade and the pragmatism of Telly Savalas' character.  The three primary leads actually make up a pretty good yin-yangish kind of composite person, the tightly reined-in but actually quite visionary cynic in Kelly, the practical and cautioning skeptic in Big Joe, and the free thinking Oddball.  All of the actors, including those in relatively minor roles, are superb, but who could forget Oddball's all knowing facial expressions, as if only he were privy to some private joke, his admonitions that Moriarty quit with the 'negative waves,' his out-of-left-field dog imitations (both of them, including his ""other dog imitation""), his kicking back with some wine and cheese and ""catching some rays"" during the final battle, etc, etc, etc.  He's a visionary, too, with his idea of playing music during his attacks  -- did Coppola get the idea for that classic helicopter- gunship ""Valkyries"" scene in ""Apocalypse Now"" from this movie? Oddball's very existence makes the film somewhat self-aware, but the scene that perhaps brings this home more than any other (and hopefully dispels any viewer's lingering suspicion that this is primarily a 'serious' war movie) is the Tombstone-style 'showdown' with the last operational Tiger tank, complete with dubbed-in jangling spurs as tribute to Clint Eastwood's spaghetti- western legacy.  I could see how some might not like such a movie, but I love it. The producers also did a nice job of keeping things authentic, other than the jarring anachronism that is Oddball and his crew of proto-hippies (though I'm prepared to accept that they anticipated the first wave of the Beat Generation, the likely explanation is that they're a deliberately contrived ironic reference to the period during which the film was made -- a kind of bridge, albeit not burning). The Yugoslavian locations fit the story and are convincing as a stand-in for WWII France.  The US military hardware is accurate as are German uniforms and, as far as I could tell (I wasn't scrutinizing every gun), their hardware.  The SdKfz halftrack that the German patrol at the minefield used may have been a gussied-up US version -- I didn't really stop to look -- but that's no big deal, not particularly obvious in the film, and more than forgivable in that the film's makers put so much thought into mocking up Tiger I tank bodies on what were really Soviet T-34 tanks.  That was a nice touch, especially for a movie that does not take itself particularly seriously, is not a serious study of war (though war forms its background, people die, the pointlessness of war is highlighted, and the enemy's not painted as one-dimensional fiends -- indeed, the movie's real enemies, in some ways, are Allied commanders). I like that the remnants of Kelly's Heroes teamed up with the SS Panzer commander (divisional markings correct for the elite 1st SS Panzer Division 'Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler,' as far as I know) to share the spoils, too, further bolstering the message that it's war itself, rather than people that wear different uniforms, that is the soldier's enemy. My capsule summary, I guess, would be that watching this excellent movie is a very enjoyable way to spend a thoroughly entertaining 2-1/2 hours.  Woof, woof.  That's my other dog imitation."

","I got this movie out awhile back to have a family showing of a film that i enjoyed when first released. That was a mistake. I remembered it as a comedy, what i saw on the screen was a very graphic war adventure a la Peckinpah. Sure it was still humorous, but it was also violent,especially the railway scene,even with the soundtrack. It just goes to show what sticks in your mind and what doesn't. All said and done though it's a very good film. The anachronism of Oddball is no different to that of Shakespeare in some of his plays - such things are included to shed light. The American army may have been stiff but I'm sure the Aussies and the Kiwis would have had such characters, and as someone else said 'the tankers were a breed apart' as were the submariners. It's a great movie, but not for all the family."

","Among 'war' films, Kelly's Heroes is right up there with The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Private Ryan and Metal Jacket for me. Even though it's amusing and far-fetched, it's brilliant entertainment. I'm no expert in assessing whether the weapons and equipment for the time (WW2) are accurate, but it doesn't matter....the film is that good. Clint makes a good job of his character as usual BUT, for me, Telly Savalas, at his very 'loud mouth' best, steals the picture, as I think Eli Wallach did in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Also good performances from Donald Sutherland and Don Rickles add to this really enjoyable war/buddy/heist movie which would be in my personal best top ten, covering all genres."

","Late on in WWII most soldiers just want to get to Berlin without dying; the last thing they want to be is 'heroes'. However when an opportunity is presented, in the form of gold bars worth 16 million USD stashed in a bank just behind enemy lines, some of them change their minds about taking risks. Soon a rag-tag group of U.S. soldiers is mounting a 'private war' through German lines to get their hands on the loot.<br/><br/>This is a very well made film with a good script, an excellent cast, and fine photography. Made at the height of the Vietnam war, it is basically an anti-war satire. However, considering its comedic intentions, many of the battle scenes are as realistic and as bloody as those in many 'proper war movies'.<br/><br/>The film was made in Yugoslavia (the part which is now Croatia). The Yugoslavian countryside passes very well for rural eastern France and (to a non-expert such as myself) all the military equipment looks very realistic. At the time the film was made the Yugoslavian army were still using military equipment with WWII origins, and from both sides. This must have eased the film's equipment logistics considerably.<br/><br/>They blow/smash a lot of stuff up in this film and they blow/smash it up for real. Even at Yugoslavian prices it must have cost a fortune! The three Tiger Mk1 tanks in this film look very realistic. I wondered about this (I later discovered that there aren't three working Tiger Mk1 tanks anywhere) until I found out that they were modified T34 tanks. The Yugoslavians had already converted them (to a very high standard, although the gun turret is unavoidably further forward than it should be) for a domestic film production and they were made available for this film.<br/><br/>The version of this film (which is also available on DVD and Blu-Ray) which has been most recently broadcast on UK TV runs to over 2-1/4 hours. Unlike earlier broadcasts which were doctored for 4:3 screens, you are likely now to see the film as it was intended, in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, even on TV. It looks so much better now I barely recognise it as the same thing I saw for the first time back in the 1970s, when it was 'a big film on TV' one Christmas.<br/><br/>If, when watching the film, you wonder if there isn't a back story missing from some of the characters, you'd be right to; there was another 20 minutes or so to this film which was cut before release. Whilst they probably did the right thing in some respects (it would have been too long for cinema release). I like this film enough that I'd sit through a longer version quite happily.<br/><br/>Some folk might now only watch this film because it is 'a period piece'; and it is one. But it is also a good film in its own right and (violence asides perhaps) I would heartily recommend it to anyone."

Which is not a bad thing at all. Nor does the comedy element ruin this serious war/action/comedy/adventure movie. It instead enhances it. The scene with Clint Eastwood (Kelly) and George Savalas (Mulligan) is hilarious. Even Donald Sutherland's beatnik character (Oddball) is a bit out of step with the 1940's, it still works well with this unit of misfits.<br/><br/>There are a couple of bad acting moments from a couple of the lower ranked grunts, but the rest of the cast is 1st class. Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, Carol O'Connor and Clint Eastwood are all in top form.

"bowmanblue","7","3","3","14 September 2017"," True star power
","There are some films that need little introduction. 'Kelly's Heroes' is one of them. However, in today's Hollywood, movies about the Second World War are few and far between, so some may question the relevance of an ensemble piece set in the dying days of Nazi-occupied Europe. First of all, I'll probably stick my neck out and say that it's probably not that 'historically accurate' (or at least not to my knowledge!). By that, I don't mean that Allied forces are fighting zombies or abducted by vampires. From the little I know of the period, all the uniforms, military language and techniques look genuine enough to fool a layman like me. When I say it's not 'historically accurate' I mean that, whereas most films of this era concentrate (naturally) on the struggle between German and Allied forces, 'Kelly's Heroes' offers more of a 'crime caper' set during the conflict. If I could compare it to anything, I'd almost say it felt like an 'Ocean's Eleven' in the middle of World War II.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood plays the titular 'Kelly' – a war-weary soldier who's had enough of potentially dying any day without anything to show for it personally. So, when he learns of a bank full of gold behind enemy lines, he puts together a group of equally ambitious troops all willing to risk their lives for a slice of the bullion. As I mentioned, it's a bit of an ensemble cast, the two most notable additions are Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland, both who vie for position of the cast member who's trying to steal every scene they're in. However, just because the film is largely about the quest to blow open a bank vault, doesn't mean that it's not a war film. The setting alone means that our 'heroes' come up against all the perils associated with the period and there are some pretty impressive set-pieces when it comes to the action.<br/><br/>I think the best thing about 'Kelly's Heroes' is that it has a pretty broad appeal. Obviously fans of war films will enjoy it, but you have the added bonus of having Clint Eastwood in the lead (and in his prime, no less) supported by some amazing acting talent. Then throw in the action element and the engaging crime plot and you're really going to invest your time into caring whether these (not so heroic) heroes get the gold or not. Don't be put off by its age. It's as good – and more importantly fun – today as it ever was. I will never grow tired from watching a tank freak out the opposing forces by playing music loudly as it comes into battle!"

Hutton directs and Troy Kennedy-Martin writes the screenplay, it stars Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland and Don Rickles. Music is by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography is by Gabriel Figueroa.<br/><br/>When it comes to light that there is a considerable stash of Nazi gold waiting to be plundered behind enemy lines in occupied France, a group of maverick U.S. soldiers set off on a deadly mission to locate and gain...<br/><br/>Woof Woof!<br/><br/>Utterly wonderful. Kelly's Heroes mixes together war movie action staples with black comedy gold, the greed and insanity of war having its cheek poked by a sharp and bloody tongue. The script is clever, often very funny, often poignant and poised, and it's this that lets a great cast have a ball. You have the straight laced delivery of Eastwood playing against Savalas' macho rage, and Rickles' jumping- bean turn jostling with Sutherland's pre-hippy malarkey. Character names range from the likes of Oddball, Crapgame, Big Joe, Little Joe and Cowboy, a rogue group of soldiers deciding they want to grab something for themselves.<br/><br/>Up yours, baby!<br/><br/>The journey to find the gold is of course far from straight forward, with Hutton constructing some white hot action scenes. And it's here where it often gets forgotten that Kelly's Heroes does not forget the blood shed during war. People do die, it's not all fun and frolics, and Hutton knows his way around great suspense passages. Witness the brilliant minefield sequence and the ticking clock finale where we are never sure if any of the men will achieve their goal. So laugh while you ponder, then? Absolutely. Kelly's Heroes is caper and chaos, beef and brawn, but always cunning and crafty as well. 9/10"
"dummer-isaiah","9","6","8","22 September 2014"," A must watch
","If you're thinking about seeing a movie I would suggest you take a change of pace. Instead of going to the theater and paying a lot of money try watching a much older movie. One movie that has stood the test of time is a movie called Kelly's Heroes. A movie that takes place during World War 2 and it is about a squad of soldiers on leave who plan to rob an enemy bank forty miles behind the enemy lines that has sixteen million dollars in gold bars. It's not to miss. Even though this movie is forty years old and that many of you might not have even heard of it the film can still be quite entertaining. Unlike most movies about World War 2 that are action thrillers this movie is a comedy and there are definitely some very funny moments in this film. The one downfall off all the comedy scenes is that they all center around one character ""Oddball"". Luckily for the film the actor Donald Sutherland did an amazing job bring the character to life especially the voice he uses. Even from the first time he talks you can tell he is playing an idiotic hippie. If that wasn't good enough this film also has the famous Clint Eastwood with his cold hard stare is perfect for the battle hardened leader Private Kelly (hence the title Kelly's Heroes).<br/><br/>The movie is pretty funny but comedy isn't the only thing this movie brings to the table. It also has some good firefights. It's not a real World War 2 movie unless there are bullets flying through the air, machine guns going full-auto, people dropping dead and explosions everywhere. Probably the best fight in the movie is when the squad reaches the town with the bank in it and they have to face forty soldiers and three tiger tanks. I don't want to spoil anything so I would suggest to anyone who doesn't want to see the whole movie see that fight sequence. It doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about this movie is how the blend the comedy and action together so fluidly. One moment you're on the edge of your seat the next moment your laughing your butt off. An example that comes to mind is when the squad is first trying to cross enemy lines. They're all in jeeps and they're driving as fast as they can and Germans are all around them shooting and they're shooting back. Then one of them ask about the air strike that is supposed to come in. it then cuts to this guy lying in bed then an alarm goes off and in his haste he picks up a bar of gold instead of the phone and yells ""fire"". A couple of seconds later he realizes it's a gold bar so he picks up the phone and yells fire. Then it cuts back to the fighting and now explosions are going off all over the place. It's really funny<br/><br/>If you are looking for a good movie to watch try Kelly's heroes. The movie may be forty years old and the action scenes may be a little out dated for some people (not me of course), the comedy is still gold. It was funny then and it's funny now. Evan today I still chuckle at the movie. It really is a movie you must see."
"bmcclain","Null","6","8","11 December 2000"," the role of Oddball a ""magnificent anachronism""
","...to steal a line from the movie Patton.  (It's something a German intelligence officer says about Patton, in case you're wondering.)<br/><br/>Whenever I think about this movie, Oddball the tank-platoon commander is one of the first two things that come to mind (along with probably the world's last operable Tiger I tank doing its thing).<br/><br/>Finding a traveling band of nonconformist weirdos that also happens to be a tank platoon stretches credibility beyond its breaking point -- to a useful end.  As everyone else here has noted, Oddball's very presence in a WW II story is bizarrely out of its own time.  But that's probably for a purpose: The anachronism provides the appropriate note of unreality to the whole of the film, preventing it from being merely a black comedy about war and lending it a timelessness and universality.  We're looking not merely at a story about WW II; we're seeing a parable about Vietnam (the era in which this movie was made) and about war, greed, and stupidity in general.<br/><br/>
Including an anachronistic character may well have been studio-exec sop to contemporary marketing tastes, and an idea that's too stupid and crazy to work on paper, but it works beautifully on film.<br/><br/>But why?  The key is Donald Sutherland, one of the busiest yet most underrated actors of our time.  He took an impossible and pivotal role and made it work -- and work well. Every moment he's on the screen, he seems to relish the very strangeness of ur-hippiedom.  I've seen this movie easily a dozen times since it was in the theater in my childhood, and each time I've watched with mingled glee and amazement as Sutherland does his thing so effortlessly."

","A typical World War II movie this is not. If you had any doubt it's all dispelled when Donald Sutherland appears on screen as Sherman tank commander Oddball. An anachronism if there ever was one, Oddball represents not one, but two distinct eras that followed the 1940's. His 'Hi Man' and 'don't you dig how beautiful it is' corresponds to the following decade's beatnik period, at the same time mingling with the Sixties' fascination with hippies and their 'freaks' and 'negative waves'. All pretense at a serious war film is done away with pretty quickly, and that's not even taking into account the impossible task set before Kelly's heroes.<br/><br/>Thinking about it now, Kelly (Clint Eastwood) took a lot on faith when he took the German officer's word for fourteen thousand bars of gold stashed away in a French bank. Personally, I would have been a lot more skeptical myself, but that's just me. Not only was Crapgame a pretty good name for Rickles' character, but pretty much described the mission and it's chances of success.<br/><br/>Just before my viewing of the film on Turner Classics, moderator Ben Mankiewicz explained how the production was filmed in (then) Yugoslavia because the country maintained so much of it's military hardware left over from WWII. So at least there's that element of authenticity to complement the story's action sequences. Not sure about the title though; I realize it was Eastwood's Kelly who came up with the scheme, but he was subordinate to Big Joe (Telly Savalas) rank wise. To my mind, Savalas might have had even more screen time than the top billed star, causing me to think that this might have been better served up as 'Telly's Heroes'."

","When a German colonel is captured by Kelly, a US soldier, black bars are found in his bag; he claims they are just lead so he could sink the bag in a river but a few scratches reveal them to be gold. After questioning him Kelly learns there are fourteen thousand more bars in a bank in Clermont Kelly decides there and then that he intends to get the gold. He will need help though as Clermont is thirty miles behind the German lines. The rest of his platoon are soon persuaded to join in; they are fed up of risking their lives for Uncle Sam; they want to do something for themselves for a change. They will need support though; this comes in the form of three Sherman tanks under the command of the distinctly odd 'Oddball'. It won't be easy; before they can get their hands on the gold they will have to pass through the front line, pass through thirty miles of enemy territory and finally deal with the German's in the town and their three Tiger tanks.<br/><br/>This is a fun film; nicely combining a war movie with a heist movie to give us a really entertaining time. Clint Eastward puts in a solid performance as Kelly and Telly Savalas is equally good as his sergeant 'Big Joe' however it is Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Oddball that is the most memorable; he gives us a great character; a hippy long before there were hippies! The rest of the fairly large main cast are also pretty good. The film contains some great action which is bloodless so there are no disturbing images. That isn't to say that nobody dies; a few good guys and dozens of Germans are gunned down or blown up; the ratio may be more than a bit unlikely but this was never meant to be taken that seriously. As well as action there are plenty of laughs to be had along the way. If you are a fan of any of the main stars this is a must see and I'd certainly recommend it to anybody wanting a war movie that isn't too serious; the PG rating means it can be enjoyed by all apart from young children."

","Kelly (Clint Eastwood) goes behind the lines and capture a German Colonel. Big Joe (Telly Savalas) is more interested in women and hotels than any military intelligence. They are getting hit by their own fire as well as the Germans. Kelly discovers that the Germans are actually transporting gold. As everybody pulls out, Kelly intends to steal the gold with a few of his fellow soldiers. Their Captain is more concerned about transporting a yacht to Paris while his men take a 3 day rest in the middle of nowhere. Crapgame (Don Rickles) is an opportunistic supply sergeant. They recruit Oddball (Donald Sutherland) and his three Sherman tanks. The gungho General Colt (Carroll O'Connor) berates his men for their lack of fighting spirit. When Kelly's men break through, he eagerly follows their advance.<br/><br/>This is a fun WWII movie. It's really a heist movie. The war is full of ridiculousness. This has more in common with MASH and that's not simply about Sutherland. He does create one of most memorable characters around. He is hippilarious. It's an irreverent take on the chaos and the incompetence of war. There are a lot of action blowing up lots of stuff. It's one of those movies where lots of Germans get killed. At the core, it's a really fun heist movie."

","Kelly's Heroes is a fun World War 2 Heist movie with a fantastic cast including Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland. Kelly and a bunch of soldiers go 30 miles behind enemy lines to rob a bank holding 16,000 gold bars. This is much easier said then done since there are a lot of German soldiers, and when they are not fighting them or walking through mine fields, they still have to contend with their own air force shooting at them or bombing the bridges they need to use. The action in Kelly's Heroes is fairly realistic, and there is a great tank scene near the end, but where it really shines is with the cast being allowed to play off each other and Donald Sutherland just stealing every scene he is in. Kelly's Heroes is well made, and quite enjoyable, so if you are in the mood for a not quite traditional war/heist movie, then Kelly is your man. 4 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18lA6u1kcfc"
"dave13-1","9","4","5","29 April 2012"," A great personal favorite, and a terrific movie.
","At a time when movie audiences found themselves confused and bored by youth culture movies that seemed to have no plot and no point, and studio executives had clearly lost sight of how to make a successful picture, along came this movie with just about the perfect blend of the new and bold with the tried and true. It successfully mixed easily recognizable, Old Hollywood forms (the WWII action picture, and Telly Savalas as a tough sergeant whose first and only thought was for his men; the military comedy with Don Rickles as the hustling Sgt. Bilko- style supply sergeant) with the latest cinematic trends (heist movies, crime thrillers with the slightly amoral viewpoint of focusing on the perpetrators, Clint Eastwood as a laconic Sergio Leone anti-hero looking out for himself, Donald Sutherland as a Bohemian proto-hippie). The result was a deft exercise in product updating and a huge hit. Any longtime fan of WWII actioners had a lot to enjoy, while the disaffected protester next to him ate up the idea of infantry grunts defying orders to pull off a robbery! <br/><br/>The reason behind the success of this movie was simply high quality at every level. Action sequences were beautifully staged and shot and were highly exciting, comedic elements (satire, sight gags, throw away jokes) were integrated smoothly into the action without ever seeming forced or out of place, and the ensemble work amongst the mismatched crew worked brilliantly as contrasting types played off one another to generate both comedy and occasional tension. The dialogue crackled with clever exchanges, along with tons of sad sack humor and character business, all played against the epic background of a big budget war picture. <br/><br/>Clever satiric touches find their way into the mix as well. I love the early scene in which an officer reminds a subordinate that the penalty for looting is death, all the while securing a commandeered sailboat for shipment to his uncle, the general! <br/><br/>There is so much here to like that the movie almost demands repeated viewing just to properly appreciate the sheer volume and quality of its component elements. Enjoy. More than once."

","Spectacular War film with a touch of irreverence about a reckless group of U.S. soldiers undertaking a dangerous mission behind enemy lines , as they sneak on Nazi territory to get their hands on a secret stash of valuable treasure at a bank , containing 16 million dollars in gold bars. Exciting film with a truly silly formula about a misfit team led by lieutenant Kelly (Clint Eastwood) who carries out a suicide mission behind enemy lines . A group of two-fisted soldiers formed by a misfit band with egoistic aims are drafted to go on a near-suicide mission and attempt to take the bullion from a French village occupied by Nazis . This strange, motley platoon is led by Big Joe ( Telly Savalas) and with the aid of hustler Crapgame (Don Rickles), anachronistic , lame-brained hippie named Oddball (Donald Sutherland) and three old Sherman tanks that subsequently will take on Tiger tanks . Kelly leads his men ,turning his G.I.s into a valiant fighting unit , and going deep into French territory to steal the gold for themselves .¨ Kelly's heroes¨ is an entertaining film with Clint Eastwood as tough officer along with the ordinary team of renegade soldiers of World War II whose mission is to steal the Nazi secret treasure from a villa . In the hands of hardboiled director Brian G Hutton and a tough-as-leather cast , that's all the plot that's needed to make one rip-roaring wartime flick. Eatwood's mission is two-fold and in violent and cynical style : the selfish and mean group undergoing across a dangerous territory and executing hazardous feats , they then turn loose on a villa located in France where cause destruction . The first half of the film allows the colorful cast of character actors to have their fun as they get their tails whipped into shape and develop shaky relationship with their leaders . The final part is all action, as the brave commando wreak havoc and then run for their lives. Despite the fact that most part of the ""heroes"" survive the bloodbath, the message here isn't that war is hell. Rather, it seems to be: war can be a hell of a good time... if you've got nothing to lose . The dangerous mission includes a selected group formed by a motley and varied but disreputable squadron played by all-star-cast and notorious secondaries . This is a rugged WWII actioner concerning a squadron of dispensable characters with no past and no future . The Privates are oddballs , rag-tag and undisciplined gang , under command a selfish Lieutenant and other rare characters . At the end they must participate in the suicidal mission behind the enemy lines , to wipe the German group by means of a violent assault over a strongly protected village.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood as Lieutenant Kelly assumes the character of commando leader in this better than average wartime movie well directed by Brian G Hutton. This moving film packs frantic thrills, lots of familiar faces, perilous adventures , comedy , relentless feats , and buck-loads of explosive action and emotion . The noisy action is uniformly well-made, especially deserving of mention the rip-roaring final scenes on the village , including some spectacular shootouts , an amusing showdown in Sergio Leone-Ennio Morricone style and bombing . Apart from the values of team spirit , cudgeled by Eatwood into his rebel group , the film is full of feats , humor with tongue-in-check and thrills . Clint Eastwood is good as leader of the motley pack together thwart the Nazi schemes, as well as the largely secondary cast as Gavin MacLeod , Richard Davalos , Gene Collins , Harry Dean Staton, Perry Lopez and with special mention to Carroll O'Connor as grumpy general . Atmospheric and functional musical score , including inappropriate songs , by Lalo Schifrin and colorful cinematography by Gabriel Figueroa . This is a wartime typical vehicle and into the ¨warlike commando genre¨ , in USA style which also belong the American classics from the 60s as : ¨Dirty Dozen (Robert Aldrich) ¨ Where eagles dare(Brian G. Hutton) , Tobruk (Arthur Hiller), Devil's Brigade (Andrew V McLagen) and many others .<br/><br/>The motion picture is well handled and professionally directed by Brian G Hutton, and achieved success and cash . Hutton started his career with little and prestigious films , such as ¨Wild seed¨ and ¨The Pad¨. There after, he veered off into big budgeted and all-star movies, proving which he could handle big scale production, as ¨Where the eagles dare¨, one of the best from Alistair McLean, and of course ¨Kelly's heroes¨ in which added humor to the warlike action. His next picture was ¨High road to China¨ marked a partial return with panache to his previous form but faltered at the Box-office, in spite of being quite amusing and with occasional touch of directorial skill. Rating : Above average , for that reason is a must for adventures buffs."

","Released at the height of the Viet Nam conflict, ""Kelly's Heroes"" did not amuse critics, who found a light-hearted war film in extremely poor taste at a time when thousands of American boys were becoming casualties of a highly controversial military action.  Thirty years on, however, it has become something of a popular classic.<br/><br/>More a caper film in a WWII setting than an actual war pic, ""Kelly's Heroes"" follows the exploits of a motley platoon of G.I.'s as they attempt to 'liberate' 14,000 gold bars from a bank 30 miles behind German lines.  The script is a gem, focusing on the mechanics of organising ""the perfect crime"" without tipping off Army bureaucracy, or the enemy, and is chock-full of memorable lines and authentic touches that sell the unlikely premise (for example, a major plot point revolves around the well-documented inferiority of the US Sherman tank vs. the German Tiger I).<br/><br/>Nearly the entire cast turns in memorable performances: Telly Savalas as Big Joe (basically Sgt. Rock come to life), Carroll O'Conner as a clueless, blood 'n' guts General, Don Rickles as a mercenary quartermaster, Donald Sutherland as a hilarious proto-hippie tank commander, and numerous other recognisable faces in smaller roles.  Clint Eastwood plays his usual tight-lipped tough guy, and wisely leaves the jokes to the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>
Director Brian G. Hutton, hot off the success of ""Where Eagles Dare"", was given a big budget to play with, and puts the money to use blowing up whole companies of faceless Nazis in several spectacular battle sequences. Well-chosen Yugoslavian locations stand in for 1944 France.<br/><br/>
The DVD version released in late 2000 is of excellent quality.  Beware of the version often shown on television; numerous minor cuts have been made and the image cropped from the original widescreen format."
"joekwiatkowski","8","5","7","19 May 2017"," Perfect casting...
","I haven't read the other reviews, so I don't know if anybody else has touched on this point, BUT...have you ever seen a movie where it seemed that the parts were written specifically for the actors that played them? This movie seems that way to me. I get the idea, right or wrong, that the screenwriter had Telly Savalas in mind, for instance, for the role of 'Big Joe' before he inserted the first sheet of paper into his typewriter. Ditto for Don Rickles, Clint Eastwood, Donald Sutherland, and all the rest. Personality-wise, they all fit into their roles perfectly.<br/><br/>With regard to the idea of making a comedy movie set in the midst of war, I suspect that soldiers involved in combat develop their own bitter sense of humor in their attempts to cope with the tragedy all around them.<br/><br/>I would have been more offended with the early sub-plot involving 'Big Joe' (Sevalas) and his concern with securing willing French girls for his men to have sex with. What do feminists have to say about that? I'm no expert, but I suspect that soldiers are even more concerned with sex than the 'average man' since they don't know if they'll have the opportunity for one more intimate encounter before they get killed in action.<br/><br/>One minor aspect I was very pleased to see was the selection of which unit the characters came from. The script placed them in an outfit that was actually in that part of France in the late summer of 1944. I would have to suspect that the movie was set in September of 1944, since the Americans hadn't yet taken Nancy and there was one sequence where the men are siting around in their t-shorts, apparently quite comfortable.<br/><br/>All in all always a lot of fun to watch, whenever it's on TV."

","The cynical, anarchic spirit of 'Catch-22' is alive and well in 'Kelly's Heroes', an entertaining romp about a group of soldiers who attempt to rob a bank during the closing days of world war two. Aided by a cracking script from Troy Kennedy Martin (better known in Britain for 'Edge of Darkness' and, improbably, 'Dr. Who', but who also scripted the not dissimilar 'Italian Job'), the film manages to reflect the genuine horrors of war, work as a tense thriller, and induce laughter simultaneously. Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland are both great value, and there's thankfully little screen time for Clint Eastwood (the eponymous Kelly, whom he plays with his usual, tiresome ultra-cool hardman act). Personally, I felt the story could have done with one final plot twist; but in any event, it's still one of the better war films made, for in spite (or maybe even because) of the comedy, it conveys a real sense of what it might be like to fight, and die, without one shred of sanctimoniousness."
"BoomerDT","9","2","2","20 April 2020"," Top Notch Cast, Entertaining Action-Comedy
","Can't beat the cast in this. Eastwood, Savalas, Rickles, Sutherland, Carrell O'Connor star in this great ensemble cast movie, part WW2 story, part comedy, part caper movie. Made in 1970 at the height of Vietnam, it also has a bit of an anti-war statement as Kelly (Eastwood) a former officer who's been busted to PFC, is able to convince the rest of his unit under the command their Master Sgt(Savalas) that instead of getting killed for swapping real estate with the Germans, it makes more sense to rob a bank behind German lines that they've discovered has $10M in gold. Rickles and Sutherland really steal every scene as Rickles plays Crapgame, a Sgt & con man who runs a supply depot and can get Kelly all the armament and supplies needed and Sutherland plays Sgt Oddball, an early hippie with a tank unit that they will need to blast open the bank. Virtually all officers are portrayed as ignorant and self serving idiots in KH-ii may be their war but it's the enlisted man's fight. It's mostly comedic, but there's some good action scenes. 50 years later it's still fun to watch, not dated."

Here the mission is the heist of gold behind enemy lines--something Kelly inadvertently finds out about before deciding that his troopers will carry out the scheme right under the noses of the Nazis.<br/><br/>It's all in fun, and some of it is even funnier considering that hippies didn't exist in the '40s so that the flavorsome performance of DONALD SUTHERLAND as Sgt. Oddball is really an anachronism. His quips are strictly from the '70s but his contribution is so full of laughs that it's easily forgiven in the spirit of enjoying a war story that doesn't take itself seriously in the first place.<br/><br/>All the men seem to be having a great time--including CLINT EASTWOOD, TELLY SAVALAS, CARROL O'CONNOR, DONALD SUTHERLAND, RICHARD DAVALOS, GAVIN MacLEOD, HARRY DEAN STANTON and DON RICKLES.<br/><br/>Summing up: Just the right brew for a lighter look at wartime escapades!"

","Contains Spoiler. This film was made because ""The Italian Job"" bombed in The States. It is essentially a remake of that film for Americans who want to watch a war movie. It is not a film about WWII, unless WWII happened in the 60s. Donald Sutherland plays a hippie. (D.S. also in more recent remake of Italian job:- not a coincidence.) All that aside, a film to watch in the company of a few beers; excellent musical score and some wonderful set pieces. Only jarring note is the massacre of German soldiers, once in a scene where Telly Savalas visibly grieves for one dead American after killing several dozen Jerries; and again in later scene when the last surviving German Tank crew join up with the Americans who killed all their mates. On the other hand the Railway scene works because it is just so surreal, and has no inappropriate scene immediately following it.

","Released in 1970 and directed by Brian G. Hutton, ""Kelly's Heroes"" is a war dramedy starring Clint Eastwood as the title character who convinces Sgt. Big Joe (Telly Savalas) & his platoon and a free-spirited Sherman tank commander (Donald Sutherland) to spend their three-day leave on a gold heist at a French village. The events take place 12 weeks after the Normandy invasion.<br/><br/>""Kelly's Heroes"" was obviously inspired by ""What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?"" from four years earlier. Carroll O'Connor even plays the same basic role, a general who mistakes the misdeeds of Allied soldiers as brave, selfless combat; and arrives on the scene to commend them. The picture miraculously combines zany comedy with serious war action and is highlighted by the fun, eccentric theme song ""Burning Bridges"" by The Mike Curb Congregation. Of course the all-star cast is great with Sutherland standing out as Oddball. People complain that Oddball was anachronistic since he was a late-60's hippie type, but his crew resembled Gypsies and, besides, there are laid-back free-spirited types in every generation.<br/><br/>While the film is overall superior to ""What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?"" it's inferior in that it lacks a female cast member in the form of the jaw-dropping Giovanna Ralli. Actually, the film was slated to have a female role, but it was cut from the script prior to filming. The stunning Ingrid Pitt was cast, as she worked with Eastwood two years earlier in ""Where Eagles Dare."" Ingrid was virtually climbing on board the plane bound for the set in Yugoslavia when word came that her part was cut. The fools.<br/><br/>The film is a little overlong at 144 minutes and should've been cut by about 15-20 minutes, but the compelling last hour makes up for the flabbiness. The movie was shot in the Istrian village of Viinaa in Croatia (former Yugoslavia), substituting for France.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"

","It's Memorial Day weekend, and on TV you can find many war movies playing. It seems that someone on the satellite menu always has ""Kelly's Heroes"" playing during this weekend.<br/><br/>Before I review, some disclosure: my first viewing of this movie was particularly memorable for me. I saw it at the Rudder Theater at Texas A&M University in 1978. Most of the other people viewing the movie were members of the Aggie Corps of Cadets. Now I don't know if things are still the same at A&M, but back in '78, the Corps added their own very memorable soundtrack of cheers, boos and hisses to every war movie that was shown at Rudder. This was no exception. Watching ""Kelly's Heroes"" at Rudder Theater at Texas A&M in 1978 was the same sort of experience as seeing the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" at the Nuart Theater in Venice, California in the mid-70's: you had to have been there. It was an EXPERIENCE. The audience didn't watch the show, the audience participated in the show.<br/><br/>Now that I've got that off my chest, here's the review: I love this movie, but it is not for people who want to see a movie that treats the war experience with either grimth or reverence. This is not a serious war movie, it is not faithful to history, and it is not going to give you the warm fuzzies about anything.<br/><br/>So why watch it? Because it is straight-up FUNNY and watchable, that's why! And it has a young Clint Eastwood in it. My god, now that he's old and all his recent movies have him as an old guy, it's easy to forget that when he was young, he was one good-looking dude! As the hero of this movie, playing the title role of Kelly, he is sooooo easy to watch.<br/><br/>And the other actors: Telly Savalas. Don Rickles. Donald Sutherland. Carroll O'Connor. These guys are GOOD, and if you're too young to remember them as young and to have seen them acting in their prime, this is a good movie to bring you up to speed on them.<br/><br/>The plot is a straightforward caper movie: it's near the end of WWII, the defeat of the Germans is a foregone conclusion, it's just a matter of how and when their capitulation will take place. For most of the troops involved on both sides, at this point the major concern is not getting killed in some unimportant final action as the war winds down. And, if opportunity presents itself, in picking up the pieces of spoils that are available in the chaos and confusion of the end.<br/><br/>It's in this disorganized situation that Kelly, a former Lieutenant busted to Private to take the rap for incompetence in the command above his level, finds out that in a town some miles away and behind German lines from where he and his men are stationed, there is a bank that is the repository for a truckload of German gold. Long story short: Kelly and his buddies figure that they're going to go for the gold and get something out of the war for themselves.<br/><br/>The movie skewers war movies in a gentle way, and it also takes the opportunity to send up the ""spaghetti western"" genre that Eastwood did so well. Donald Sutherland's character, Oddball, bears mentioning as a real anachronism. Oddball is a hippie ahead of his time, and if you find this sort of thing jarring, you're not going to like his character. You have to have a sense of humor, and remember that this is NOT a serious war movie, if you're going to go along for the ride.<br/><br/>I love this movie and when it comes on TV on Memorial Day weekend, I usually find a way to watch at least part of it.<br/><br/>And, I have to admit, part of the reason I like it is that it takes me back to that experience of seeing it for the first time at Rudder Theater at Texas A&M, with the Corps of Cadets all around me, barking at Oddball and hissing the Germans."

","Director Brian Hutton followed up his smash hit World War II espionage thriller ""Where Eagles Dare"" with ""Kelly's Heroes."" Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton masqueraded as Germans to infiltrate an impregnable castle and rescue a prisoner who knew everything about D-Day. Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, Donald Sutherland and Eastwood behave like renegades who plan to loot a heavily guarded bank behind enemy lines. ""The Italian Job"" scenarist Troy Martin Kennedy pulls off a spectacular premise that had never been done before when he combined a World War II movie with an impossible heist thriller. A platoon of restless G.I.s who are left to their own designs storm enemy lines to rob a bank. Since command has pulled them out of battle and ordered them to take rest and relaxation, they decide to grab something for themselves. Clint Eastwood plays Kelly, a former U.S. Army lieutenant demoted because somebody had to assume blame for a botched mission that claimed the lives of all his men. Kelly captures a German officer,Colonel Dankhopf, and interrogates him with liquor to loosen his tongue. Our hero discovers an ingot of gold that looks like a lead bar in the Colonel's brief case. Initially, Dankhopf tries to persuade Kelly that the bar is really made out of lead so it could sink the satchel in water. As Sgt. Big Joe, Telly Savalas co-stars as an abusive but skeptical non-com, while a woolly Donald Sutherland steals the show as a stoner tank commander. Eastwood and company set out for a $16 million pay day and wind up turning the tide of battle with their exploits. Confronted by angry Germans prepared to kill them, our heroes find themselves being pursued by a crazy General (Carol O'Connor) dying to hand out medals for gallantry. The finale in an occupied town is played as if it were a World War II version of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is inspirational. ""Kelly's Heroes"" boasts ingenuity, suspense, tension, and humor. The scene where Oddball's tankers destroy a railway shipping center to the tune of ""I've Been Working on the Railroad"" is really amusing.

","I have read some of the reviews of Kelly's Heroes here and that has sparked me to write what I think is my first review ever.<br/><br/>People say it is not a war movie and not a comedy and dated and with bad acting and so on and so on.<br/><br/>Why not take the movie for what it is (and no, I am not going to classify it). It is NOT the greatest comedy of all time nor is it the greatest war movie. What it is, is a great movie that entertains you continuously in every scene all through.<br/><br/>I love it and have watched it around 100 times. That is not a usual exaggeration, but I actually tried to calculate it last night with my wife (who loves it too by the way, but would not say it the greatest movie of all time)."
"bkoganbing","8","3","4","25 May 2009"," Proper Motivation
","Kelly's Heroes is a film that puts forth the notion that with proper motivation, soldiers will perform all kinds of heroic deeds in battle. Of course I don't think that West Point or any of the other military academies had the kind of motivation that this film gives Clint Eastwood and the collection of GIs he assembles for a caper.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood as Private Joe Kelly interrogates a captured German Colonel and learns of a stash of gold bullion in the town of Clermont which is behind enemy lines and a place that General Carroll O'Connor is anxious to capture. Sixteen million dollars in bullion and as proof Eastwood is given a bar of it as a sample by the inebriated Colonel.<br/><br/>As the war seems to be at a stall, Eastwood decides to grab the gold for himself and some trusted confederates. I don't think he thought this thing through, the problem of hiding it and fencing it assuming you capture it is not really discussed. And of course the stuff is behind the enemy lines.<br/><br/>But where O'Connor can't move, Eastwood finds a way because he's motivated. His crew also gets larger and larger and pretty soon there won't be enough to share.<br/><br/>Kelly's Heroes is an interesting war comedy/drama with a real twist for an ending that I won't even give a hint of. Director Brian Hutton assembled a nice cast of familiar and soon to be familiar names to support Clint. My favorite is Donald Sutherland as the Sherman tank commander nicknamed Oddball and it's an apt moniker. Sutherland is a hippie born 20 years too soon, but definitely a character who would have been appreciated by the film audiences of the Seventies.<br/><br/>Such favorites as Don Rickles and Telly Savalas and Stuart Margolin are all in on Eastwood's caper. This is one fun movie.<br/><br/>But an odd choice for a Memorial Day showing celebrating the fighting spirit of the American soldiers who died in battle on TCM."
"freemantle_uk","8","3","4","23 December 2008"," Tongue in cheek war film
","Kelly's Heroes takes an unusual view on World War II, taking a tongue in cheek, light hearted approach, similar to the book Catch-22.<br/><br/>Kelly's Heroes starts a small unit of American troops capturing a German Intelligence Officer. These troops are war-weary, having to fight hard and yet when their unit is close to any town they are brought back in reserves, so don't get any of the joys of liberating French towns. When looking through the German officer's case Private Kelly (Clint Eastwood) found a gold bar, and after getting the officer drunk he finds out the Germans had $16 Million worth of gold in a bank in Clermont, France. Disillulation with live in the American army, Kelly sets out a darning plan to go 30 miles behind enemy lines and rob the bank.<br/><br/>The film has the feel of a western with the style of its plot and the way it was shot, and at the same time takes some of the best aspects of World War 2 films from the 1960s and 1970s. They are some good action and war scenes through out the film. As well, from a comedy aspect are decent without being too out and out funny, having a more subtle type of humour. It could even be described as a comedy of errors. The best performers in comedy was Donald Sutherland as the stoner tank-commander Oddball and Carroll O'Connor as the bulliest Major General Colt. Clint Eastwood was also on top form as he normally is.<br/><br/>It's worth watching."
"lost-in-limbo","8","3","4","2 March 2006"," You won't be getting any negative waves from me!
","During WW2, the USA army are battling the Germans in France and former Lieutenant now Pvt. Kelly abducts a German official to get some information out of him, but instead he accidentally learns that there is a fortune of gold bars in a bank behind enemy lines. So, Kelly comes up with a mad scheme, which his misfit platoon get involve and those you can help out in the plan of sneaking in to knock off the million dollars in gold. While this is happening, Major General Colt who's tracking them on the radio believes that these passionately brave soldiers are leading the way in, trying to win the war single handedly, but we know otherwise.<br/><br/>Whoa! There's nothing but all guns blazing in this big production well, also throw in zillions of flourishing explosions causing a lot of loud bangs which amount to pure destruction and during the night sequences a spectacular light show every now again. This continuously runs for over two hours! That may seem overlong, but it doesn't feel it. That's because in never takes a break, well not a long one at least and because of that there's a brisk pace about it. So, you surely can't ask more. But this hybrid, comic book war flick doesn't just only go gung-ho, but it also mixes in a real jokey script that never disrupts the balance between the bouncy humour and dead serious moments. Very much, it successfully gels the two together. Actually if you've seen ""Three Kings (1999)"", you'll know what to expect, as it's very similar to that film. The humour and central idea are actually very close. Other then an economically clever script, an excellent ensemble cast help keep this from turning into an outrageous spoof. You could say it's a vehicle for the stars, even though too many stars can spoil the brew, but here it comes through with flying colours. Clint Eastwood might get top billing here, but it's his co-stars that mostly chew up the screen time. These are very much larger than life characters in this platoon full of wise guys. Eastwood gives a steely performance as Pvt. Kelly. You got Telly Savalas as MSgt. Big Joe the demanding father figure of the platoon. Don Rickles as Crapgame, who always like to speak his mind. Carroll O'Connor plays the hilarious Major General Colt and finally the most memorable of all would be Donald Sutherland's sweet talking hippie tank-man Oddball. He makes a great opening entrance and his dialog has a lasting impression! ""Have a little faith."" Also you got the likes of Harry Dead Stanton, Gavin MacLeod and Hal Buckley. The superb chemistry between all was that of first class. What made it great was that when there was no action occurring, you got humorously great exchanges between the believable characters.<br/><br/>Director Brian G. Hutton who also directed Eastwood in the solid ""Where Eagles Dare (1968)"" comes up with a grand scale war/heist flick that builds up some tension in certain scenarios. These can be found in the opening sequence, and especially in the minefield scene and of course the final battle for the gold in a sleepy town. Also he provides some enterprising periods like that towards the end of the flick with the final showdown in the town square that reminisce something out of a spaghetti western. Well, it did have a western theme song playing through it. That was a nice added touch. The camera work is pretty standard, but does break the ice at times with some flair. The pounding and sometimes rattling score pretty much stuck with the standard themes like that of the drum based to trumpet playing that you hear in most war films, but it did cater for all moods. Plus the theme song may seem dated, but the buoyant tune ""Burning bridges"" by The Mike Curb Congregation does have an everlasting charm about it. Under all that haywire and spicy banter script is an anti-war slogan, but that never gets in the way of the entertainment valve. So does it hit any hurdles? Well if it did, it went unnoticed by me.<br/><br/>Being an Eastwood fan I've made it an aim to see every flick of his, so far I haven't come across many I don't like. There's something about his subtle presence in films that I find it simply irresistible that it's hard to take my eyes of off. But here, he had a lot of other great performances to work off. This is purely a boy's own adventure here to entertain with its rising excitement levels and chirpy humour that's never far away. Highly entertaining war caper with plenty of ka-boom!"

","""Kelly's Heroes"" is indeed a film set during World War II, but there is little or no similarity to actual happenings. Clint Eastwood and a rag-tag band of US army soldiers undertake the knocking off of a bank behind enemy lines, and the results are pure pleasure for the viewing eyes.<br/><br/>Eastwood, during interrogation of a captured German officer, learns of a German bank located behind the lines, and plans a bank robbery during an enforced furlough. Naturally, he is unable to do it himself, but he would like to keep the numbers down as low as possible. Secrecy, or keeping the information from the ears of the commanding officers in his army group is also of a paramount importance. With the aid of such stalwarts as Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, and Donald Sutherland, the ""heroes"" head out for the town where the bank is located.<br/><br/>During the trek toward the bank, the band of men encounter the usual military problems, but manage to make it to the town where the bank, and the fortune in gold bullion, is located. Germans still hold the town, the real army group headed by Carroll O'Connor, is drawing nigh, and Clint needs to deal with the German tank command that is right in front of the bank. How that is handled will leave the fans of this genre with a pleasing watching experience."

","Great war movie. I will agree with most comments thus far regarding Eastwood, Sevalas and Sutherland (Oddball). The theme music is really catchy, the plot really unique and the interaction between the characters really hilarious. Notwithstanding the wisecracking this film does have serious moments and does not trivialize war and resultant death associated with it.<br/><br/>I will only add this - my favourite part has to be the beginning when Eastwood has the German officer in his jeep and his driving through the German occupied town with the Wehrmacht soldiers ignoring him completely, and the Burning Bridges theme song plays in the background.<br/><br/>Classic and so sublime !!! :-)"

","Kellys Heroes is a great movie , a bank heist attempt in the middle of a war.Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas are simply at their best when this one was filmed. Kellys Heroes sets the standard as a Comedy War film , not to be taken as anything else.Ive seen this film about five times and I enjoy it , every time I see it. Clint plays the cunning Kelly , and does so with little hidden relish and probably inspired the Sgt Harry Callaghan all film goers came to know and love. The plot is excellent , but what makes it work better , is the characters that are lumped together with one mutual value , greed. The spirit of American capitalism and enterprise is given free reign in this picture , but you have to admire the way the director placed a 1940's (hippy) Oddball amongst a crowd of unscrupulous entrepreneurs. A message to the 1970's hippy generation was definately sent out by the film industry(and perhaps government) , which was getting and making money is a pillar of freedom , just as much as free love and lifestyle. The film is and will remain a great comedy film that displays in no uncertain term , the American experience....Opportunity."

","I didn't catch this flick until after it had been shown on network TV several, (many?), times. As such, I thought the DS character Oddball, was right in keeping with the times. I base this opinion on one thing, and, I will explain. In a Playboy magazine anniversary issue, (I don't recall which one), they reprinted an article from the 1950s by Jack Kerouac, voice of the Beat generation. (Termed beatniks by the press.) He stated clearly, that the non-conformist individuals know as beats, began appearing in cities in the late 1930s. The ancestors of the later generation hippies. Anyway, I had read the article before viewing KH, and it made perfect sense. Oddball wasn't a time shifted hippie, he was an early beat. If Kerouac was still around, I'm sure he would have recognized him."

","Director Brian Hutton was responsible for two classic action movies, ""Where Eagles Dare"", released in 1968, and ""Kelly's Heroes"", released in 1970. Both were old fashioned adventure movies, both were set in WW2, both filtered a past conflict through a Vietnam Era prism and both were packed to the brim with wild chases, humour, tension and lots of beautiful scenery.<br/><br/>""Kelly's Heroes"" was originally intended as an anti-war satire, but was severely reedited by studios until it resembled a more straightforward action movie. Made the same year as ""MASH"" (which also featured Donald Sutherland as a hippie), Eastwood and Hutton envisioned the film as an anarchic satire, Vietnam era anti establishment spread thickly across the more prim and proper battlefields of World War 2.<br/><br/>""Heroes'"" final cut retains some of this irreverence, but most of its playful cynicism now resides solely in Oddball (played by Donald Sutherland), a tank driving hippie who spouts such lines as ""Why don't you knock it off with them negative waves, baby?"" and ""Why don't you say something righteous and hopeful for a change?"". He's a fun character (and a nice contrast to Eastwood's stoic persona), who helps imbue Hutton's film with some ""flower power"" playfulness. <br/><br/>Yet despite its goofy plot (our heroes fight their way across France in an attempt to rob a German bank) and marijuana fuelled soundtrack, Hutton also bathes his film in lots of detail. A siege on a town plays out like the end of ""Saving Private Ryan"", and several skirmishes are filled with tension. ""Kelly's Heroes"" may be a counterculture comedy, but it nevertheless works tremendously well as a conventional war movie.<br/><br/>Arguably better than ""Kelly's Heroes"" - though perhaps less interesting - is ""Where Eagles Dare"", an epic adventure movie based on an Alistair Mclean's novel. Filmed in Austria, the film looks great, filled with snow capped mountains, perilous cable carts, a cool German castle and even a babe called Heidi. Hutton's direction would prove hugely influential, many of his scenes lifted by Tarantino and George Lucas, and several of his sequences re-staged as levels in modern video games.<br/><br/>Of course the film will seem a bit dated to modern audiences weened on fast edits, taunt action and CGI. Hutton's rear projection work in particular now stands out like a sore thumb. But Clint Eastwood is always cool, and those who like casual violence will find several scenes in which Clint mows down stairwells full of Germans to be shockingly laid back. Clint isn't just unphased when dishing out violence, he's positively relaxed.<br/><br/>The 1960s and early 1970s saw a number of ""boys own"" adventure movies being released (""Dirty Dozen"", ""Guns of Navarone"", ""The Great Escape"" etc). Films like these used war, not to express any moral or patriotic sentiment, but as vehicles for action, aimed primarily at the young 'modern' audiences of the Vietnam era. These films may have done nothing but dished out casual violence and reduced WW2 to a series of heroic adventures, (Huston did this stuff right with ""The Man Who Would Be King""), but nevertheless surpassed the next wave (Indiana Jones, Star Wars etc) of similar flicks because they, arguably, retained a certain adult sensibility. A sensibility that would be completely eroded come the 1980s.<br/><br/>8/10 - See Pontecorvo's ""Burn!""."

","With the Vietnam War in full swing in 1970, it seems that the movie studios wanted a way to play previous wars for laughs, if darkly. That year saw the releases of ""Catch-22"", ""MASH"" and ""Kelly's Heroes"". The last one has an American platoon looking for Nazi gold during WWII. The only thing is, this is the most whacked-out platoon ever! Pvt. Kelly (Clint Eastwood) may be pretty normal, but Sgt. Oddball (Donald Sutherland) is a proto-hippie! And the rest of the guys (Telly Savalas, Don Rickles and Carroll O'Connor (right before he started playing Archie Bunker)) aren't your average soldiers either.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a really funny movie. Obviously, we've all got to come up with ways to maintain our sanity in war, but there's nothing like how these guys do it!

"goedgedaanjochie","Null","4","6","4 October 2002"," Whose gold was it in the first place?
","Reading all the great comments on this page, a few things comes to mind. A number of people mention greed as one of the main themes in this film. The great thing about greed is that you don't worry about who the original(or rightful)owner was of the things that you've obtained. In this case nobody wonders where the Germans got the gold from. It probably wasn't theirs in the first place as they were retreating from France in this stage of WWII and looted everything worth taking back with them to Germany. So the gold probably belonged to the French. The great thing about this film is that you identify so instantly with the good guys (because the director and the actors make you believe that they are)that you might think ""If we don't steel the gold from the bad guys, it will be lost for the original owners anyway"". Another extraordinary thing about this film is the lack of special effects or constructed scenery. Even in Band of Brothers you see the same Gate appear a number of times in different villages to cut the costs, but here a complete and real Yugoslav village is wrecked and blown up for a movie. And brought some badly wanted hard currency into the socialists wallets. The Yugoslavs couldn't have foreseen that half their country would look like this almost thirty years later.<br/><br/>Every time I watch this movie I more appreciate it. Its 'over the top story' is well documented in the comments here but the attention to detail is amazing as well. For instance in the scene before the one in which our bunch of heroes is shot up by their own planes, you hear the reconnaissance plane spotting them, but you never get to see it. Just the sound adds to the tension. I could go on about this but find out for yourself again and again, on a wide screen TV watching the DVD, in order to enjoy the great ""western"" scene to the most."

","When I saw the movie...again...recently, I realised something. The movie is funnier than it was the last time around. How did that happen? Maybe I grew older. Or maybe, I have learned to appreciate the talents of those other than Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>To be honest, this is not your typical Eastwood fare. Sure, he does have his usual diet of dead bad guys, but the movie belonged entirely to the heroes of his namesake, Kelly. It belonged to Savalas, Sutherland, Rickles and O'Connor.<br/><br/>This can be the film that ended many excellent war movies that came up to that time, for a simple reason. It is not exactly about war (WWII, in this case). It's about greed and it may or not be relevant to that period or situation. Make analysis of this film and its relation with the real war of the time it was made (Vietnam), and you are in for a disappointment. It ain't no Platoon or Apocalypse Now. Its Ocean Eleven set in war field. It is more than that. It is about adventure. It's a caper.<br/><br/>Damn, it took me so long to find that word. So, this caper would not have been fun without the participation of the excellent cast. Sutherland, in particular, stands out as Oddjob, and watch out for his dog barks. The score is out of place, cheesy, but remember this is not Saving Private Ryan. Generous on laugh and high on excitement.

Speaking of war, while this film has a 70s attitude, the battle stuff is strictly 60s TV - plenty of action but nary a drop of blood (sorry Mr. Spielberg).

It suffers from ""Ramboization."" Ramboization is the phenomenon where the heroes bullets always find their mark, but the enemies miraculously seem to miss the hero(s) with far too much regularity.<br/><br/>Basic plot: Typical GI's just trying to stay alive find out about a secret cache of gold 30 miles behind enemy lines. Unit goes rogue, recruits a tank commander and does what the army has been unable to do, mainly break through enemy lines. Several fight scenes occur on the way, mainly suffering from the Rambo problem.<br/><br/>Problems - Movie is way too long. Also the Donald Sutherland hippie character is totally wrong for WWII. I know this movie was made in 1970, but did people think that this would be funny? It's just weird in the context of this movie.<br/><br/>Strange scene: The movie is obviously trying to cash in on Eastwood's popularity. The spaghetti western scene in front of the bank with the Enrico Morricone like music is an obvious homage to Eastwood.<br/><br/>The movie just turned 40 years old this year. It hasn't aged well.

People are living American way of life (cinematic one at least), they don't care whom do they have war with, but at the same time we see people around celebrating. It's a real holiday of happy life, Americans came! And Americans are happy, too, and even this survived nazi is happy. Indeed, who cares about the war, when you have the money. And how about that phrase Big Joe says to German about the stupid war, and that he doesn't know whom and what for are they fighting... says after Kelly's Heroes have killed around 50 Germans themselves. In the end it is a light western mixed with some war action. Doesn't even smell as a satire. And it's not about war for God's sake. I don't know how can this film be named as one of the greatest war movies."

Great turns by Donald Sutherland, Carroll O'Connor, Telly Savalas and Don Rickles seem to point the way more towards comedy and in spite of lots of problems I still liked the movie in the end due to its extremely witty characters.

The disjointed nature of the film, featuring bullet-sponge Nazis and wacky comedy, but also US Army joes getting suddenly blown up with land mines. Screwed up fire missions with friendly fire falling on US troops is treated as utter wackiness; the film was made during Viet-Nam, when similar situations plagued our real army. I found this film to be incredibly insulting, which is the main reason I gave it the one-star rating.

The film itself has no excuse being 144 minutes; I felt myself aging in its presence.<br/><br/>But the final word has to be about the alleged ""comedic"" properties of this movie. It's one of those films that thinks volume and destruction are automatically funny. Everyone yells and pounds home the dead-on-arrival jokes with loudness, as if that alone will put some life into the writing. When Sutherland annihilates a Nazi train yard (with Nazis more inept at combat than Lucas' ""battle"" droids), he rides off in a tank down railroad tracks to the tune of ""I've Been Working on the Railroad.""

","Watching KELLY'S HEROES is a deeply irritating experience if you go in with the mindset that it's a war movie . Look at the cast for example where we see forty something actors playing front line combat troops , it's almost as bad as the John Wayne laugh fest THE GREEN BERETS and despite the screenplay being written by Briton Troy Kennedy Martin we have to endure these ridiculous scenes where a handful of American soldiers wipe out wave upon wave of German troops . Am I allowed to mention that in France during WW2 for every German soldier killed by a GI in combat the Germans killed two Americans ? <br/><br/>You should of course view KELLY'S HEROES as a cross genre movie , a heist movie set against the backdrop of the second world war that doesn't take itself too seriously . Even so it would have been a fairly unmemorable movie experience if it didn't feature Donald Sutherland in the role of Sgt Oddball . The character is totally anachronistic , he's some type of hippy whose hair and beard goes against US Army regulations and speaks about strange concepts that no one would have any inkling of in 1944 but that's the whole point of his character and he's played superbly by Sutherland in one of his best roles and who steals absolutely steals every single scene he appears in . Without risking any type of litigation the trivia section of this page mentions that Mr Sutherland was "" seriously ill "" while making this . I wonder if he was taking any herbal medicine at the time ! This is a movie that is saved by one single performance , that of Sutherland's <br/><br/>I doubt if it's supposed to be an allegory on Vietnam despite the hippy subtext and the friendly fire incidents unlike say ULZANA'S RAID , CHATO'S LAND and TOO LATE THE HERO . Imagine how differently this would have been received if it was set in 1969 Vietnam where an American platoon team up with the NVA to get their hands on 16 million dollars worth of opium so they can sell it on American streets ?

"Leofwine_draca","7","3","5","10 August 2016"," Light-hearted war movie fun
","One of those old-fashioned all-star movies, this is a film which is very easy viewing, amiable throughout, and one which provides good-natured laughs at regular intervals. In the days of modern blockbusters which contain snappy one-liners, frenetic pacing, and more, it's refreshing to see an older movie like this which is content to take things more slowly and build up the plot before getting to the action.<br/><br/>The story of a plan to make a daring raid on a bank in occupied France is a fresh and interesting one, while the budget of the production is high enough to give the war and battle scenes a realistic look; you never for one second aren't convinced of the authenticity of the situation. As the scale of the journey grows, so do the laughs, one particularly good moment arising when the US General mistakenly believes that the men are advancing the lines instead of going out on a limb to get themselves some rewards instead. The ending of this film is highly suspenseful, consisting of a minutely-planned raid on the bank which is unfortunately guarded by Germans complete with three tiger tanks.<br/><br/>The cast is one to die for, containing heavyweight turns from the reliable Clint Eastwood and Telly Savalas, a comic performance from Don Rickles as a bumbling and greedy companion, plus one memorably kooky performance from Donald Sutherland as a whacked-out hippy who is definitely before his time; his warped character is disturbingly strange while being frequently funny at the same time. Savalas is the gruff sergeant who chews the scenery, Eastwood the somewhat bland and heroic leader who doesn't have many memorable characteristics about him.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is the fine mix between war movie and comedy. One minute we're laughing along at the jokes, the next feeling down about a man who gets blown up in a minefield. The skillful mix is what makes this film watchable, as on the one hand you get to enjoy the thrills and spills of a war film, and on the other you get to laugh at some fine comedy and have a good time while you're watching as well. Good music and photography complement the film on either side, and although the running time is long, the time goes by pretty quickly and never outstays its welcome. Recommended, light-hearted fun with just the right balance of action and laughs."

Clint Eastwood is the film's straight man, almost out of place, but he adds tone and restraint. I don't think he cracks one smile.<br/><br/>Don Rickles as an enlisted man stretches credibility.

","I guess there are two ways of seeing this movie. Either you see it as a comedy with the Second World War only as a setting, but not as a movie that shows some real and actual events, either you watch it as a war movie. If this had been a real war movie, than I wouldn't have liked it a bit, because it doesn't show anything of what the war really was like and it doesn't do anything but harming history and the soldiers that fought in that war. Personally I think this is a comedy and it has to be said, it's a nice one.<br/><br/>When Private Kelly (Clint Eastwood) interrogates a German Colonel who has been captured with nothing but a briefcase, he finds out what the man's task was. He had to keep an enormous amount of gold worth $ 16.000.000 out of the hands of the allies, by transporting it from the French bank, where it is now, to another location further away from the front line. Kelly wants that gold for himself and plans to rob the bank with some fellow soldiers. To do so, they slip through the enemy lines. But this bold action does not only bring them close to immense richness, it also gives new hope for the stranded troops and they are decorated for their bravery by the unknowing general Colt...<br/><br/>A movie that stars Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, ... always promises a lot of fireworks and that's exactly what you can expect here. No, it isn't real or possible at all, but it is incredibly funny. A hippie tank commander who always is talking about positive and negative vibes, general Colt wearing a flashy red pyjamas with stars on the shoulders,... Of course that never really happened, they didn't even have hippies in that era, but this movie gets away with it all because it is all so humorous.<br/><br/>I guess the best movie to compare it with is ""Three Kings"", the movie about three US soldiers who are trying to capture Iraqui gold during the first Gulf war. This is exactly the same type of story, only told in a different time period. And just like I liked that one, I also liked this movie. It offers a top cast, some fine acting, a nice story and a lot of laughter. What more can you possibly ask from a comedy? I reward it with a 7.5/10."

","I didn't expect much the first time I watched this movie (Don Rickles?), but was hard up. I figured it would be a joke. What a surprise!

Realistic language, too. Plus the quirky incidents (the fecal happenstance included) that are characteristic of real combat. All of the equipment is phenomenal, especially for 1970, before it was popular to find old equipment and refurbish it.<br/><br/>My greatest criticism has always been for the Oddball character, who acts like a hippie and uses 60s lingo. The comment by Steve Willoughby put my mind at ease about this.<br/><br/>Not sure where the writer gained his insights into war, based upon his credits.

"maximum_verbosity","Null","3","5","4 May 2004"," Good war film, with minor problems
","Others have already outlined the story, so I'm not going to do that again; this is a black comedy war/caper film, enough said. It's an interestingly simple plot, with some superb cast members including Donald Sutherland as Oddball (my favorite character in the film). Eastwood and Savalas come across as very believable military archetypes (Kelly the ex-LT, Big Joe the tough sergeant). Other members of the cast are a little bit caricatured or otherwise simple, especially the over-the-top General played by O'Connor. Of course caricature is an effective way of satirizing something, and it works well in this relatively antiwar film. In some instances it provides some good lines (when Crapgame has just climbed out of a blown-apart out house, Cowboy says ""You boys smell you fell in a dung heap"" - Crapgame replies ""Kinda makes ya homesick, doesn't it!"" (Crapgame is a New Yorker who has no use for Cowboy, or Texans in general).<br/><br/>One of my favorite lines in the movie: ""To a New Yorker like you, a HERO is some kind of weird sandwich!"" (Oddball).<br/><br/>I've never been in the military or combat but the several battle scenes feel honest to me, brutal but not overdone, and certainly not dripping in special effects. There is some irony in the title. Nobody on either side does anything particularly heroic, except what they must do to keep themselves alive and get the gold. Big Joe even says ""Never stick your neck out for nobody."" Joe also sums up war when, after the minefield scene, he says ""They're dead so forget about it.""<br/><br/>My only other gripe is the theme song. Where did that come from??? I guess they saw the name of the song ""Burning Bridges"" and decided that would do... I get the feeling from a number of movies of the early 70's that themes songs did not often receive a lot of thought.<br/><br/>One of the more interesting aspects of the story is that a military unit would be very good at robbing a bank! Kelly's heroes have training and discipline that few movie criminals possess. Sometimes I think a remake of this film (NOT Three Kings) would be worthwhile, but you'd never get this good a cast together.<br/><br/>The end of the film is a classic, with Oddball summing up the way it must feel to look at all that gold: ""Woof! Woof!"" B+"

","I have read a number of these comments with interest because I served in the military from the late 60's to early 70's and saw Kelly's Heroes in theatrical release and numerous times on TV since then. I found this film to be funny, sad, thought provoking, and enjoyable, mostly because of the cast and how their characters were written and how they were allowed to develop.<br/><br/>Basically, the plot is about a squad of exhausted US Army enlisted men during World War 2, sent back to the rear for some rest and relaxation, but ordered to stay in camp, who are then given the chance by an enterprising PFC (Clint Eastwood as PFC Kelly) to score a major heist, behind enemy lines and unknown to the Allied command - if they can get everything coordinated. The movie tells the tale of if and how the plan was carried out and what unexpected obstacles were presented during the operation and how they dealt with them.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into the humor provided by several of the actors (Don Rickles, Donald Sutherland, etc). but a couple of things seem to have been missed by others in the basic premise of the plot. Kelly had been a lieutenant but his commission was pulled and he was demoted (busted) for leading a totally successful attack against an objective given to him by his commanding officers. The problem was that the objective was another Allied position which had been misidentified. The character still has the smarts and leadership skills of an officer but is now just a PFC. So he is a victim of a screwed up military. And you can see the tension between his character and that of his ostensible sergeant, Big Joe (Telly Savalas).<br/><br/>One note about Sutherland's character Oddball, I'll grant that it is highly unlikely that a character like him existed during WW2, spouting mid to late 60's hippie platitudes. Yet I will also say that during my time in the military, I came across a number of characters that appear as updated versions of the roles played by the other actors. Colonels who were full of it (you wouldn't believe some of the things I saw), lieutenants who ranged from Academy graduate 'strack' troops to the 90 day wonder let's get by as easily as possible kind. Sergeants who ranged from mad dogs to pushovers, and any number of conniving enlisted men. And I've also seen the committed, caring, let's get it done and move on types.<br/><br/>I can also easily understand how the lower ranking types on the other side, can with a little help, see how they have more in common with their enemy counterparts then with their senior officers, because I witnessed it. <br/><br/>And yes, I've also seen humor through even the most trying of situations. I can see the men in Big Joe's squad understanding exactly what he means when he talks about so much luck, and I can see the men also understanding Kelly's well thought out plans Â– if their luck runs out, it runs out, but at least for a few moments they can control a tiny bit of their own destiny, because they can see all too well the results of the orders that resulted in Kelly's original platoon completely wiping out everyone there. The important thing is they (and we) can see both the strengths and weaknesses of both characters.<br/><br/>The movie was one of the more enjoyable war/caper/antiwar films I've seen and except for how loud the music was at times, I would highly recommend it."

Mr Sutherland has the showiest part, his ""Hippy Manque"" persona neatly transposed from the then current Vietnam War to the European Front.He descends from his tank in a very neat fashion by sliding his arm along the gun barrel,and easing himself onto the ground imbuing every movement with the epitome of 1960s cool. A strange sort of morality pervades the movie,after all what is such a big deal about stealing a few million dollars worth of gold in the midst of global slaughter?Who are the real villains?Kelly's Heroes or Hitler,Stalin,Churchill and Roosevelt?Enough with the serious - the movie is a comedy and a damned good one.Even if you can think of no aspect of war that is in the least bit funny try to accept that for the combatants,having a sense of humour can be a saving grace."

","I first saw this movie in a movie theater at an army base in Germany in 1970 or 1971 (don't remember exactly which) while I was in the army over there. I got a great kick out of it and still do every time I have watched it since, which has got to be at least a couple dozen times. Within the last month I have watched it twice. It is one of the relatively few movies I can put into the category of ""movies I can watch over and over and not get tired of."" <br/><br/>One thing that always stuck in my mind was the scene at the end where the German tank sgt. is invited to participate in the project and get an equal share of the proceeds, and then without another word the next thing you see is the bank door being blown off its hinges. When I was in the army in Germany they would have ""German-American Friendship Week"", or some kind of thing like that to promote good relations between the U.S. GIs and the local Germans, and one of the guys who went to the movie said ""Now that was an excellent example of real German-American friendship."" Amen. You have to realize in that scene that in real life the guys in the tank could have very easily pointed their machine guns at these 3 guys walking up toward them, and mowed them down.<br/><br/>If anyone is considering watching this, all I have to say is get your popcorn ready, you are in for a treat."

They don't give him so much as a single devastating one-liner - just flat dialog. Everyone else steals his thunder. If you look at this as a Telly Savalas / Don Rickles / Carroll O'Connor / Donald Sutherland vehicle, your expectations may be better served. The above mentioned names are all great talents in their own right and they make the comic relief suitably potent. This would be the film's greatest asset.<br/><br/>This film does boast some impressive action sequences, rendered almost too realistically for what is supposed to be a screwball comedy.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe might be the soundtrack. Could the song they use for the opening and closing sequence possibly be more corny?? It's hard to get in a WWII frame of mind when the audio is SCREAMING ""late '60's"". (All those expensive locations, props and costumes, ruined by some idiot with a guitar...)<br/><br/>Overall, it's not that bad, but it's certainly nothing great. The modern remake Three Kings is funnier, more exciting and even manages to sport a conscience without spoiling the rest of the package. And, very much unlike this flick, the stars are all utilized to their greatest potential."

While it doesn't seek to address the loftier questions about war and the civilians caught in it's crossfire like a ""Three Kings"" does ""Kelly's Heroes"" does raise interesting points about war as a tool for individual economic betterment. During the scene where Kelly and the men attempt to sway Telley Savales to join their caper Cowboy points out angrily in his distinct Texas twang, ""We're getting shot at for 50 bucks a month."" Perhaps a throw away line for some I see it as a dilemma something that has plagued soldiers throughout much of modern war. Looting, profiteering, etc. used to be the means to compensate soldiers during ancient warfare, however with the advent of the salaried army and strict rules against looting the average grunt is forced choose to either abide by them or break them. In many cases like with Captain Matlin, grunts are forced to turn the other cheek while their commanding officers line their pockets with stolen property but insist the guys who risk the most can't do the same. That all aside the bottom line is this movie is funny, smart, and has expertly shot battle sequences.

No spoilers: but the ending is sensible, believable, and, most importantly, makes me laugh every time i watch it.<br/><br/>***possible spoilers*** From oddball's tank crew to the every increasing list of people involved in the case, to the final tank fight wherein 3 Sherman's take out 3 tigers...or 2, to the great fight scenes, to the great dialogue, to the friendly fire incident...this film is pure entertainment, and pretty much clean as far as movies go!! ***end of spoilers***<br/><br/>The cast is pretty huge...Telly Savallas, Donald Sutherland, Clint Eastwood...who else do you need?! My advice to anyone even thinking about renting/buying this film...do it, doesn't matter your taste, this will while away a couple of hours that you will be glad you spent on it..."

","My brother came to Denmark from New York as a 10 year old in 1971, the in-flight movie was ""Kelly's Heroes"" ... he was ""stunned"". A year later I saw why. Comedy, slapstick, thrill, action, tragedy ... all presented by a cast never seen before or since. My ""gang"" and I made a point of seeing Kelly's Heroes at the movies once a year, and did so for 7 years 'till we drifted apart after high school in 1979. Since then I've seen it at least once a year with friends or family. Every time has been a joyful reunion with Kelly (seriously sarcastic), Big Joe (sarcastically serious and tough), Little Joe (whine-o laughable), Crapgame (hilarious), Oddball (hilariously hilarious), Moriarty (Where would Kelly be without him), Mulligan (hilarious), Cowboy (fun), General Colt (Archie Bunker gone general ?) and on and on. Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen and still see whenever it shows."

","During a battle on the western front of the Second World War Pvt. Kelly learns of a secret stash of gold from a Nazi officer. He decides to set out during three days of R&R with a group of equally enterprising soldiers to get the gold. The problem is that the gold is secure in a bank 30 or so miles behind enemy lines, but that doesn't stop the group of strange and interesting characters to go get it anyway.<br/><br/>The movie is part satire, part action movie, and part plain old comedy. Basically it covers, or tries to cover, as mush ground as its heroes do. And it is that which ultimately works against the movie as the different tones end up interfering with one another. By the time you get to the scene where the main characters annihilate a Nazi patrol you start to think that director Brian G. Hutton didn't fully switch gears from his previous movie, Where Eagles Dare. Big loud explosive shootouts in which the Americans wipe out what must be at least 10 times their number by the end of the movie. That makes the movie a boys own action adventure that Where Eagles Dare was, but then the goofy comedy bits throw it off and the satire never really takes effect.<br/><br/>Getting back to the scene where the patrol is killed: two of the Americans also perish in the scene and for some reason sad music comes on as the rest of the heroes with sad faces look on their dead comrades ignoring the fact that they just slaughtered 30 German Soldiers. It feels absurd to have an all out action movie shootout followed by emotions you'd see in a drama. There should at least be some hint towards the other side of what just happened, but the film provides none.<br/><br/>However the rest of the movie is a lot better. The premise is interesting, the characters odd in a good way, and the production is pretty stunning. Keep in mind that this is 1970, yet the town at the end manages to at least equal the set in the final sequence in Saving Private Ryan. The rest of the sets and locations are just as good. Then the costumes, equipment, and many other details are convincing and impressive.<br/><br/>Overall it's good and entertaining (positive waves), but the constant changes in tone are annoying (negative waves). --- 6/10<br/><br/>Rated PG for violence"

Even Uncle Leo from ""Seinfeld"" has a part (long before Seinfeld).<br/><br/>The plot just rollicks along, building on what could be a plausible event at the start and gradually sucking in everyone in its path until its conclusion. Never really a dull moment.

"janecreates","8","2","3","4 February 2007"," a true and brilliant one off
","Kelly's Heroes is one of those films that appeals to the imaginative and the emotionally grown up. Never meant to be taken as a serious look at War itself, Kelly's Heroes is never the less strongly themed and morally centered. It's all about breaking away, anti establishment and anti war values - all of which perfectly echo the time it was made - 1970. To judge it in any other way is to totally miss how the film was meant to be taken. This is a film that leaves one with a sense of, 'anythings possible'. It also makes the point that War can be totally absurd. There are some amazing War films out there that should be judged on their accuracy and ask serious questions, this however, is not one of them. It's actually a heist movie at it's heart, with the satire of the War as an overlay and setting. The characters are beautifully developed and wonderfully interlinked. The comedy scenes are great, the production values high, the story face paced and fun, the direction and editing good. sit back and enjoy that rare event in the film world - a pop corn film with a heart."
"dennisb-6","8","2","3","3 April 2006"," Becoming more important as the years (wars) go by
","'Kelly's Heroes' is an enduring showpiece of brilliant cynicism, with a healthy attitude toward war. I used to watch this film with my uncle, an army veteran of Normandy-all-the-way-to- Berlin, on-the-ground fighting. He would laugh and say that as goofy as it all was, the movie portrayed war as he experienced it; stupid, tragic, pointless and nasty.<br/><br/>I think it further remarkable that this film was made and released during a time when US casualties in Viet Nam sometimes exceeded five hundred dead per week. It took political courage to script, cast, produce, and distribute a movie so contemptuous in its treatment of military authority. In these times of foreign wars I wonder when a film will be made that confronts the questions of our war-policies as aptly as 'Kelly's Heroes' dismisses those of the 1960's. If it never happens it won't be too tragic, we still have this film to re-visit every few years."

"South62","10","2","3","3 June 2005"," Serious Movie
","A lots of critics missed the point arguing that Kelly's Heros mix comedy and war in kind of blasphemous way. Of course, WWII was a great fight between Good and Evil but Kelly's Heros do not intend to revise that fact. The point is that even in WWII individual desire for happiness and individual dreams existed as they always did and always would. This movie is in fact very serious anti-war poem of individualism. Oddball (Sutherland) should be remembered like (in certain way) the very first hippie in history. How would WWII look like with hippies? I am sure Hitler would exterminate them in concentration camps. Movie is very very funny. I do not remember any that I had laughed so much. I repeat comedy level should not hide the point. This is serious anti-war story and brings the hope that individual goals could fight against ugly historical circumstances."

MP settled many billboards with the words ""No speeding, no looting, no fraternizing but the scale of plundering was enormous so one of the officers from Scots Gurd, wrote in his memories that crossing the Rhein should be named ""Operation Plunder"".

It takes place in World War 2 where Kelly (Clint Eastwood) leads a bunch of other soldiers behind enemy lines to try to steal  gold (this is not a spoiler, as you will know this fact in the first part of the movie).<br/><br/>The reason it was an anti-Vietnam movie was (keep in mind it was filmed in 1970-71-height of the war) that every officer (representing the establishment) is seen either as an idiot or a gung ho lunatic.

"mhasheider","9","2","3","10 September 2001"," Strange, but satisfying war comedy.
","Strange, but satisfying war comedy that takes place in France near the end of WWII.  The tale follows Kelly (Clint Eastwood), a former lieutenant who's been demoted to private for a particular mishap finds an opportunity to redeem himself.  He gets a German intelligence officer drunk, then makes him confess that theres fourteen thousand gold bars in a bank held behind enemy lines.<br/><br/>Second, Kelly persuades Crapgame (Don Rickles), a shifty arms dealer, Oddball (Donald Sutherland), a hippie who commands three Sherman tanks, and his fussy superior officer, Master Sergeant Big Joe (Telly Savalas) and his men to come along for the three-day trip.  Big Joe is reluctant at first, to go along with Kelly, but he eventually buys the idea and lets Kelly himself be in charge.<br/><br/>There are plenty of gentle humor and the same can be mentioned for the shootouts, which are wonderfully staged and there's hardly any blood being shed.  Plus, take a good look at the tanks that Oddball commands, each one has a loudspeaker and another cannon, which is smaller and fires paint to scare away a Tiger or Panzer tank.  Oddball tells Kelly that he only plays ""loud music"" and his main selection is country.  I highly agree on Oddball's selection.<br/><br/>I'll give credit to Brian G. Hutton, the director and his screenwriter, Troy Kennedy Martin, let the movie go at a gentle pace and give anybody who's in on the deal, make their presence felt.  Also, whenever I looked at  the Sutherland character (Oddball) for a minute, I see the year that the film was released in, which is 1970.  1970 is the year of where America was up to its' neck in the Vietnam War.  Lalo Schifrin (TV's Mission Impossible) conducts an excellent score and the songs are great to listen to.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie is a delightful romp even though the final showdown is a letdown, but I won't throw it away.  Eastwood is solid as he usual is in delivering a good performance.  Savalas and Rickles are fine here as is the rest of the supporting cast, which includes Stuart Margolin, Perry Lopez, and Harry Dean Stanton. Sutherland, well, the film wouldn't be as good without him being around.  He's basically the film's highlight and quietly snatches any scene that he's in."

","Clint Eastwood stars in an enjoyable war/heist film.<br/><br/>'Kelly's Heroes' doesn't seem like it was released in 1970, the vast majority of it still holds up today; almost exactly fifty years on. The run time is a little bit too long but not by much, as I felt entertained for the most part.<br/><br/>As already stated, Eastwood is this production's lead and he performs impeccably. Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland also do good jobs here, the former as Joe and the latter as Oddball. That end showdown scene with those three is excellent.<br/><br/>My only major criticism of the film would be the lack of character development, none of the protagonists have any real depth to them. Perhaps, as Eastwood has since stated, that's due to MGM deleting the scenes that they did though I'm not entirely convinced by that argument.<br/><br/>Worth watching, for sure."

"pvilleguy","7","1","1","17 May 2006"," Anti-war war movie
","This is a fine little film, well worth a rental from your local merchant. The plot is fairly simple: World War II era American GI's learn of a large supply of gold in a bank behind enemy lines and make the decision to heist the stash regardless of the danger from the enemy and from their own superiors. The film, however, is only loosely set in World War II. Donald Sutherland's ""Oddball"" might as well be wearing tie-dyed t-shirts and grooving to the Grateful Dead. The underlying message is anti-war in the sense that, at the end of the day, looking out for number one is more important and more worth the risk than any military objective invented by so-called superior officers. The only fight really worth fighting is the fight one defines for oneself. Though not nearly as sharp in its criticisms of the military establishment as ""M*A*S*H,"" that same spirit of criticism is present in ""Kelly's Heroes,"" particularly in Carroll O'Connor's loopy Gen. Colt. This is one of Clint Eastwood's better early performances in the title role, and Telly Savalas is quite convincing as the NCO career military man who makes the momentous decision to buck his superiors for the first time in his career."

Most war movies are hard to watch because the characters are written by people who haven't lived it. It's either strained or silly. Not this movie.

"jcosyn-1","9","2","4","27 January 2011"," No Hippies Were Used In Making This Film
","This is a terrific movie, and with all the reviews of the plot already present here, I won't go into the storyline. But it is a little disheartening to see how many reviewers mention Donald Sutherland's topnotch performance as being a hippie from the '60s and therefore a strange -- though funny -- anachronism. This is simply wrong.<br/><br/>Sutherland's Oddball is not a hippie, but a hipster, and neither the language he uses (such words and phrases as ""like"", ""baby"", ""dig"" and ""negative waves"") nor the personality of his character, are the least bit anachronistic. The hipster subculture that existed in the 1940s spoke in a slang they called jive, and every word and phrase uttered by the character of Oddball is entirely consistent with the way hipsters talked and behaved. That apparently so few modern viewers realize this, and think a phrase such as ""digging some wine and cheese"" could not have been uttered before 1964, is really quite sad. Believing that the movie would include such a glaring and silly anachronism as a '60s era hippie in 1944 WW-II cheapens the movie, and betrays a rather woeful ignorance of American cultural history. To believe that an actual hippie would become a tank commander is another glaring historical misinterpretation; no true hippie would ever have been involved in anything like that. The whole idea that Oddball is supposed to be a hippie is a monumentally muddled notion, and it's difficult to believe that anyone could be that deeply confused about the past seventy years of American history.<br/><br/>The movie is far too well-made and well-written to contain anything as preposterous as a '60s hippie character commanding a Sherman tank in WW-II France. If you've never seen it, watch it, enjoy it, and understand that guys really, honestly, truly did exist in 1944 who said ""baby"" and ""dig"" and talked about ""negative waves"". If you've seen the movie and thought that nobody ever said those things or smoked reefer until the 1960s, please do yourself a favor: go to a library and read some books on American culture, especially from the 1920s through the 1940s. There has been a long, interconnected line of anti-authoritarian, drug-using, jive-talking, free-love-believing subcultures, and the story doesn't begin in 1964, or in 1952 with the Beats. The roots go back much farther than that, and in the 1940s that subculture belonged to the hipsters. Donald Sutherland plays the part perfectly."
"scotpel","10","2","4","29 May 2010"," A real gem!
","One of the greatest opening scenes in the history of film. A seemingly out of place theme song that somehow works perfectly. Attention to technical detail that puts most ""serious"" war movies to shame. An incredible cast. Yeah, the storyline is goofy and it's a period piece with its anti-establishment tone--but that's what makes this a great American movie. Anyone who's spent any time around real WWII vets knows that they weren't a bunch of flag-waving yahoos. They did their duty without questioning the why's of the war, but with a healthy dose of cynicism--check out the 1949 classic ""Battleground"" for a real GI view of the war. The attitudes of Kelly's crew have at least as much validity as all that ""greatest generation"" baloney that we've heard from ex-hippie baby-boomers trying to make peace with their aging Archie Bunker dads. (And there's Carroll O'Connor, playing Archie with stars on his shoulders!) So suspend a little belief and enjoy the ride, you'll be glad you did!"

","If you think of Kelly's Heroes as a comedy first, WWII movie second, and heist movie third, then it falls into perspective. <br/><br/>Part of comedy is taking the illogical and looking at it in a funny way. Oddball's ""hippy"" eccentricity was as strange to Kelly, Big Joe and Crapgame as it was to you the viewer. To them because it was too weird, to you because of the incongruity of 25 year anachronism. Other than the ""negative waves"", he could have been a beat, which was only a decade later. <br/><br/>As far a WWII movie, thank goodness they did it in Yugoslavia. Where else would they have gotten so many Shermans, so much accurate German equipment and use of converted Tiger/T34 movie tanks and get to destroy whole European looking towns. Yes, the 1944 tigers probably should have been painted sandy colors, but the general public want their tigers in blue-gray (a small price to pay for not having it be a US M60 tank or some other Hollywood cheat.) They at least paid attention to underwear, field jackets and rain gear. I just wish they would have shown the wear and tear and soiling of the uniforms as you go through the scenes. But then, the reality of providing that kind of costume aging vs having a clean outfit for the actor each day is just too picky.<br/><br/>Oh yea and the British guy who wrote this script also wrote the bank heist caper The Italian Job.<br/><br/>I haven't just watched this movie, I've studied it.

Of course Eastwood, Savalas, and O'Connor all show again why they achieved cult status in front of the camera. I really wonder though, why more postings don't acknowledge the actor who in a very bit part, in my opinion, caps the entire climax and yes, almost steals the whole show, even from Sutherland. The Tiger tank commander (complete with Prussian traditional dueling scar) played by Karl Otto Alberty! Flawless direction sums up the Teutonic iron will of this character in one close-up. After the brief meeting, another artful close-up dispels everything, namely the tanks gun going off! So much for slavish devotion to Der Fuhrer!

"Quinoa1984","8","2","4","21 August 2009"," as much fun as MASH, with only a few glaring problems
","Kelly's Heroes is a fantastic war/heist/buddy movie for about 90% of its running time. It's predates Three Kings by thirty years as a yarn about a group of soldiers out to get a whole crap-load of gold bars (sixteen million to be exact), and it gives us a group of characters we can have fun with and, more or less, care about in their quest for the gold. It's also one of those ""guy"" movies where there is not much sign of the opposite sex and us dudes get to hang out with Clint, Don Rickles, Telly Savalas, and a very bizarre but perfectly entertaining Donald Sutherland. And if you need to get pumped up for a new war movie coming out (i.e. Inglorious Basterds) it does just the trick.<br/><br/>We follow our group of 'heroes' who are able to slip by their superiors to go after gold locked up in enemy territory. If it doesn't have the same satirical impact of Three Kings it at least has an abundance of tough, brawny action scenes and even a fun knock at General Patton with Carrol O'Connor's character. We don't get the deepest insight into Americans or Germans during WW2, but we don't need it really anyway. It sometimes just makes for an intriguing viewing trying to figure out where Sutherland is at: he's a dead-on hippie, but without the same subterfuge that one saw in MASH... and yet, arguably perhaps, I was much more responsive to him here than with his fun-but-smug character in Altman's comedy. He keeps saying lines like ""don't make bad waves!"" and is only missing tie-dye and a joint to fulfill the package. Without a real good reason perhaps except on a visceral level, I would recommend the film if only to check out Sutherland here.<br/><br/>But there's other good things about Kelly's Heroes. Clint is Clint, which makes for some fun exchanges, especially with some of the more testy soldiers in the group or at a moment of a pinch, and Savalas makes some really good ground as one of those hard-but-fair army unit leaders who we can sympathize with when he has his doubts (the most doubtful of all) that the heist can actually work. And Don Rickles shows how he was as much good as an actor, when properly used, as a classic-snarky comedian. Other little treats include seeing Harry Dean Stanton crooning on the harmonica, the climax of the movie turning at a distinct point into a western (and, as an influence mayhap, Tarantinian), and that theme song ""Burning Bridges"" being catchy and hard-charging as a driving force for the characters.<br/><br/>My only big gripes were the beginning and end scenes, as they dragged and didn't add a whole lot to the story. It's a decent try, at the start, to establish the hectic and frenetic mood of nighttime combat, but it obstructs what's more interesting with Kelly and the drunk German. Also, the ending goes on at least five minutes too long, as we see quick cut-aways of the soldiers' reactions to seeing the gold with images of a liberation celebration in the streets, which would have been sublime, but there's more movie that goes on after this point that doesn't need it. But overall, Kelly's Heroes is a lot of fun, with convincing action and direction and writing."
"rhp6033","10","2","4","21 April 2006"," Movie Reflects U.S. Society in 1970
","As many commentators have pointed out, the juxtaposition of 1960's anachronisms in a WWII movie is quite entertaining. Some seem to get upset by it (a hippie tank commander!????), but it makes great satire.<br/><br/>What viewers need to remember is that this film was made in 1970, and as such it serves as an example of the schizophrenic nature of U.S. society at that time. Remember that this movie was released in the same year as the very popular films ""Patton"" and ""MASH"", each of which appealed to exact opposites in the political spectrum, and 1970 was at the height of the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. The film serves as a transition point, between the pro-war films of the 1960's and the anti-war films that followed over the next decade.<br/><br/>Although this movie is in the context of a war film, it is decidedly anti-military and individualistic, even if it is pro-soldier. The military mindset is ridiculed in the caricature portrayed by O'Conner as the general. The morals of the establishment are ridiculed in the anti-looting admonition from the lieutenant, warning the men that the penalty for looting was death (as he drives off towing a yacht which he plans to get back to the states, somehow). At the end, while negotiating with the Germans, they insist that they are not ""the U.S. Army"", but instead are a ""private enterprise"".<br/><br/>And yet the film has enough in it to appeal to everybody, both as a credible war movie, as a comedy, and as a satire. It is still one of my families favorite movies of all time."
"Skragg","Null","2","4","21 November 2004"," Famous, but in some ways still underrated, war comedy
","This has ""Spoilers"". This is a war movie with practically everything. And it has a cult following as an adventure film, and as a comedy, but as far I know, it's genuinely underrated as a SATIRICAL comedy (though I know it's easy to use that word for any unusual war story). For one thing, as much as MASH or Catch-22 or others, it's almost full of things that people associate with Vietnam. Not just the obvious thing, the Sutherland character, but others. The ""friendly fire"" subject keeps coming up, and the idea of army generals not knowing where their own soldiers are, and of course money, and also lines like ""We don't even know what this war's all about."" (I'm not saying people in this country SHOULD connect those things with Vietnam alone - now less than ever- only that they DO.) As for the Donald Sutherland character, like most people, I can't say enough about him. Of all the things about him that ARE ""anachronisms"", one thing that really ISN'T one is the language - most of those expressions go back to the ' 30s. (Of course, I guess the farther back you go, the more they belong to musicians and not many other people, but still, they're not genuine anachronisms.) Another strange thing is that the violence is almost ""choreographed"", without being genuinely whitewashed, especially since the Germans in the story aren't evil- most are pretty anonymous, not good OR bad. I do hate what happens to the comical German officer at the beginning, even though that happens to comic relief characters in violent stories pretty often, and even though it wasn't done by any of the main characters. What stands out for me (and here I would especially use that word ""satirical"") is the ending. The idea of approaching a stereotypical German sergeant, who seems to care about nothing but his ORDERS, and using MONEY to talk him into FORGETTING those orders. And of course it WORKED. And the fact that he was played by Karl Otto Alberty, who made a career out of playing rigid German soldiers (because of his whole appearance), made the scene work completely (even HE got to be a little funny, with his facial expressions). And of course, apart from the obvious actors, it had a whole string of character actors - Gavin MacLeod, Harry Dean Stanton, George Savalas, Len Lesser, David Hurst. I could go on and on about it, but (apart from maybe being a little over-long) just about all of it works."
"mcgrew","8","2","4","8 August 2004"," 1960's sensibilities grafted onto a WWII story
","In the same way ""MASH"" (especially the TV show) placed later moral attitudes onto earlier characters, this movie posits that a battleweary recon unit (assisted by a sort of hippy-who-kills-people, fortuitously available with some Shermans) would go for a 'big score' of gold.  As such, it's not really a WWII movie - on the other hand, it's still a great  fun war movie.   Telly Savalas really shines as Big Joe, the iron sarge of the piece, while Clint Eastwood plays his basic man-with-no-name character for Kelly, the mover and shaker.  Great music (except that awful theme song), and nicely done Tigers make it a fun watch.  Above average combat scenes."
"Steve-318","8","2","4","15 May 2004"," Part war movie, part comedy, part classic
","Not your average war movie. Fascinating cast includes Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Don Rickles and Carroll O'Connor. It's a shoot 'em up war film on one hand with Germans mowed down like the morning grass but it's also a heist picture. This movie is certainly a a product of its time with a showdown scene reminiscent of Eastwood's spaghetti western past. Sutherland plays the spaced-out tank jockey with a 60's flavor that's fun to watch. Savalas may be the toughest sarge on film and that's saying a lot. This film probably could have been a classic without much trouble. The pieces are all there. The ending needs work. But enjoy what we have which is plenty."

","""Apocalypse Now"" was not just an adaptation of Conrad's novel ""Heart of Darkness"", it was also influenced by ""Kelly's Heroes"". The films has, for instance, simlilar openings.<br/><br/>Kelly's Heroes is a complex but warm anti-war film with some real heavy comic performances. Clint Eastwood was almost as good as Lt. Kelly as he was as the man with no name (but few seem to agree with me). This is a funny and charming film, much thanks to Brain Hutton's strong direction and Donald Sutherland's acting as Oddball. Mike Curb Congregation's excellent ""Burning Bridges"" is played three times - in the start, in the middle and in the end ... This is not an overlong film either, even if it clocks around 140 minutes. The only weakness I find is the end battle - it is a bit to brutal for a film like this (but the closing scene is great). Join this journey from start to end! There is a lot of gold to find!<br/><br/>Rating: 8 of 10."
"dust-7","Null","2","4","1 August 2002"," One of my favorites
","Spoilers!<br/><br/>Very good film. Still one of my favorites. But it is a cobbled together Hollywood vice-president sort of effort, or seems like it. The cast, some well placed sets and production, and music save it.<br/><br/>Nazi Operation Tannenbaum. An American unit, fresh off the invasion on D-Day, now moving deeper into France, grabs an intelligence colonel, somehow captured by Eastwood (Kelly) and friend, right in the middle of a Nazi staging area in a rain storm. They make a break for it, run back to their lines, and Kelly discovers a gold bar in the colonel's attache case. He gets a few details - where the gold is - that it's defended by some Panzer tanks. Off Kelly goes. He convinces the unit to join him in the heist. And ultimately - they gets the gold, and presumely go AWOL to Switzerland. Their commanding officer likely reports them all dead, cause he's a goofball and how else could he explain it, and so on.<br/><br/>That's right. It's a comedy. It literally is a comedy. There are some convincing scenes - realistic big budget scenes - the opening scene, the sort of 60's western gun-em-down with Sutherland and crew taking a railway station to the strains of country music blaring on the Sherman's loudspeakers, and 'Crapgame's little office among the overabundance of crates and more crates at a depot, the army moving up, or moving back, with the planes flying over, as the unit lays to on the side of the road, and many other scenes, as well - like the commando unit/fortune hunters merrily cruising through the byways of assorted French towns on the way to the bank. Perhaps it was slated to be a big budget war film, and got sidetracked along the way - like the plot of the film, itself.<br/><br/>It seemed like a little of this - a little of that. Plot points are thrown out, forgotten, contradicted. And who cares? It's sort of directed for laughs - like the example of the operatic spaghetti western (which had made Eastwood a major star) guitar music (virtually from Hang 'em High) as the main star trio approaches the tank in the square next to the bank. Maybe it's because the offbeat, but catchy music, keeps things honest. Maybe it's because the country tunes sound even better in 2002 than they did in the late 60s. Maybe it's because the actors play it sufficiently serious when required. Maybe it's just following 'Oddball's very competent tank crews and wondering how they'd do under another set of circumstances.<br/><br/>
One of the plot points that seems unanswered, beyond whether Maitland really DID report them all killed in action, is how they advanced unimpeded after the battle at the minefield. They killed I don't know how many Nazis of what looked like a small camp/fuel dump. That would have been noticed, and pretty quickly; as would the column of engineers/band musicians that Oddball brings with him - rain or shine. And it seems unlikely they could simply have cruised unnoticed up to their destination, as they did. There would have been checkpoints. Oddball calls from a bar/cafe behind enemy lines, without so much as 'may I see your papers?"". They try to put a lot off on the confusion at the line, or front line Nazi incompetence, 'amorphous lines', whatever.<br/><br/>O'Connor plays it up, for sure. Then maybe Archie Bunker was a bit hammy, too. Now his character probably seems more 'enjoyable', because he's so nutty. I don't know how it would have played in the 60s. McCleod, soon to be Love Boat captain, I think, is pretty annoying, playing pretty much the same shifty character he did from McHale's Navy. Rickles is good. His cynical loathing always seems like it's part of him. Sutherland's oddly 'hippie' inflected loner is not quite as well set into the film as in another of his films that year, namely MASH. I don't know if the image of a hippie running a three tank armored unit, gunning down Nazis, yes, but still soldiers just doing their job at a train station, didn't do more to rile the hippies and anti-war activists of the late 60s than it would have confirmed any of their opinions.<br/><br/>Great music (typ. of Eastwood films, by the way), except for Stanton's harmonica playing. Odd mix of carefully overplotted heist film, western film 'realism' from the 60s and infantry WWII film (which Savalas plays up to cliche), tongue in cheek comedy and 'black comedy' (and what have I left out?) and a sense that the enemy isn't so different from ourselves, just doing their job, trying not to get shaken down or left behind, or gunned down like target ducks by Kelly's 'heroes'. When the 'other guy' is the Nazis, though, it's a tough sell. Nazis make good villians for good reason."
"Sonatine97","8","2","4","18 August 2000"," Enjoyable WW2 comedy romp
","A great little comedy war film with no political axe to grind and neither does it focus to much on the explicit details of the war. Instead we have a bunch of American GIs tracking down $16 million of gold bars 10 miles behind enemy lines in occupied France.<br/><br/>The leader is of course played by a rather dead-pan Clint Eastwood as Kelly, while his heroes include a wonderful performance by Savalas as Big Joe & Donald Sutherland as the ""oddball"" Oddball.<br/><br/>
Although the humour isn't slapstick or disrespectful, it is rather dry & amusing. There's plenty of war action to keep the fans happy, but its all rather secondary to the main story.<br/><br/>Eastwood, however, looks a tad uncomfortable in the role, as if the comedy isn't quite his scene. He grimaces a lot and holds a tight square jaw, without being too gung ho. But he doesn't show any inspiration in his rather straight forward role and as a consequence slowed the pace of the film right down.<br/><br/>To compensate for Clint's uninspired performance the film perks up and balances out with wonderfully spunky performances from Savalas & Sutherland.<br/><br/>Although Savalas isn't really given much to do to challenge his acting abilities he seems to fit the role more than Clint does. And in a way I'm glad to see him in a rather more humourous WW2 vehicle such as this so soon after his rather manic & sinister role as a GI POW in the 1967 classic, Dirty Dozen.<br/><br/>Sutherland's role is both engaging yet way out of time & place since he takes on the part of a tank commander with an attitude of a late 60s hippie with lots of ""hey mans, positive waves, cool man etc"". Whether director, Sutton, felt this was an inspired idea I'm not sure but it makes the film slightly disjointed & time warped.<br/><br/>Having said that, Sutherland does add a nice feel to proceedings which only helps the comedy along at a gentle but steady place.<br/><br/>And of course, the film becomes even more surreal with the clever little spaghetti western parodies so familiar with a certain Mr Eastwood.<br/><br/>Overall, Kelly's Heroes is an enjoyable romp played with a straight bat and which doesn't really offend anyone. It handles the subject of death & war with a distant yet respectful hand. It's basically the direct opposite of all the serious posturing from the earlier Dirty Dozen.<br/><br/>Although 30 years old and looks a little dated, KH is a very good film, in spite of Eastwood's rather myopic acting<br/><br/>

","""Kelly's Heroes"" is indeed a film set during World War II, but there is little or no similarity to actual happenings.  Clint Eastwood and a rag-tag band of US army soldiers undertake the knocking off of a bank behind enemy lines, and the results are pure pleasure for the viewing eyes.<br/><br/>Eastwood, during interrogation of a captured German officer, learns of a German bank located behind the lines, and plans a bank robbery during an enforced furlough.  Naturally, he is unable to do it himself, but he would like to keep the numbers down as low as possible.  Secrecy, or keeping the information from the ears of the commanding officers in his army group is also of a paramount importance.  With the aid of such stalwarts as Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, and Donald Sutherland, the ""heroes"" head out for the town where the bank is located.<br/><br/>During the trek toward the bank, the band of men encounter the usual military problems, but manage to make it to the town where the bank, and the fortune in gold bullion, is located.  Germans still hold the town, the real army group headed by Carroll O'Connor, is drawing nigh, and Clint needs to deal with the German tank command that is right in front of the bank.

","Kelly's Heroes does not really know what type of film it wants to be. Perhaps a war drama? Perhaps a dark comedy? With a simplistic plot, an oddly anachronistic soundtrack and only a cursory effort at historical authenticity, this movie should have been made as a light-hearted comedy. However, the scenes of occasional death and subsequent characters being depressed made the comedic angle rather forced. Add to this the now-dated anti-establishment themes and hippie character and this movie just doesn't have the charm of say, a Dirty Dozen. Perhaps in 1970 this flick was seen as a good movie involving WW2, but since then the bar has been raised numerous times and this movie simply isn't good enough to stand on its humorous elements alone. Perhaps it is now a cult classic, but it probably isn't a very good movie."

","Its easy to pick the three guys about to become big TV stars: the guy playing Moriarty, Big Joe and the german general with the grouchy voice and the crazy hair. Big Joe is okay, but all three give very television performances, and give the general impression that this is television-sitcom grade humour operating here, when there is humour. I'm a Donald Sutherland fan and i didn't think he was that good. Found the stoner character a hamfisted, obvious ploy for comic relief. As a whole, though, its not as bad as i've started to make out. A so-so to good war flick will please blokes, as in general it endorses hanging out with buddies, blowing things up and disrespecting most laws for personal gain. Clint Eastwood was at the height of his stardom here. He was the top dog in Hollywood. If you want to see him give a better performance, and have much more fun watching him, see The Good the Bad and the Ugly instead. Dirty Harry would be a better option, if you feel like a cop flick, or his own Play Misty for Me (which you may or may not be impressed with - i took it with a grain of salt) for suspense/thriller/horror in the Hitchcockian vein. Remade as Fatal Attraction.<br/><br/>If you want a buddies-at-war picture, which has less explosions, better sticking-the-finger-up-at-establishment, more and better fun Donald Sutherland, and more innovative storytelling in general, check out Robert Altman's MASH.<br/><br/>You may like Kelly's Heroes, however.

","THIS MOVIE, WHILE HIGHLY ENTERTAINING CAN BE CONFUSING TO ANYONE STUDYING THE HISTORY OF WW2.

No one could make a movie about the Vietnam war in a negative light back in 1970.Hollywood skirted around this by making movies about the Korean war and World War 2. The only way to understand this attempt is to treat it as satire. Those opposed to the Vietnam war were the target audience for this prime example of manipulation. Donald Sutherland as a hippie tank commander is, in my opinion , one of the most absurd characters to grace the screen in many years. It is a pleasant diversion, but not to be taken seriously.

","Kelly's Heroes suffers on every angle. Its intended to be a war comedy, which makes it very difficult to write, and the screenplay looks as if someone spent all of ten seconds on each page. It is a poor screenplay, and a poor idea. It looks like a group of drunks got together and said, ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we did this in the script"", which ultimately makes for predictable, lame scenes. Even good actors would have a hard time making a poor screenplay work, but good talent often shines through. O'Conner shines as the General Patton type, chewing up the scenery, but Eastwood has never been an actor. He's been in about a hundred movies, and maybe four of them were good. He runs the usual gamut of Eastwood expressionless emotions. All one of them. Even John Wayne could make two or three expressions. But Eastwood is the worst of the worst actors. (A good director, though.) When you think of all the money and time spent on this project, for a few laughs from the future Archie Bunker, and some forgettable characters that even the best actor would have a hard time making interesting, this is truly a bomb."
"MartinHafer","6","3","11","12 March 2010"," Anachronistic but enjoyable.
","An anachronism is something that does not belong in a given time period, as it really belongs sometime in the future. For example, if you see a viking film where the vikings all ride about on Skeedoos--that would be an anachronism. Or, if at the Battle of Gettysburg, the Confederates used nuclear weapons--again a major anachronism. Now this movie does not any mistakes THAT obvious, but it is filled with anachronisms--the sort that make history teachers like myself a bit crazy. While the film was very, very enjoyable, I just couldn't get past the character played by Donald Sutherland. I am sure many thought he was the best part of the film, but he also played a beatnik circa 1958 (or later) even though the film was set around 1944. When he and his men played loud music to announce their attack, it looked great in the film--but made absolutely no sense! And, for that matter, the American soldiers' general lack of patriotism is anachronistic--though the story IS based on a real robbery perpetrated by a few American and Germans. The problem is SO MANY soldiers in this film couldn't give a darn about the war or their country--and soldiers at that time were NOT like that--they would have been the rare exception. The attitudes towards war ARE typical, though, of many soldiers in Vietnam in 1970. So, the film takes contemporary sensibilities (and songs, for that matter) and pumps them into a WWII film. In many ways, this infusion of modern sensibilities into a war film is highly reminiscent of the film M*A*S*H--another film that people enjoyed, but really was filled with mistakes and Vietnam-era attitudes.<br/><br/>Now if you can ignore all that (and I could, but with great difficulty), the rest of the film is quite enjoyable though a bit too long. I like long movies, but this one seemed about 15 minutes longer than it should have been--reducing its impact. Still, on a mindless level, it's quite enjoyable and the film is packed full of familiar faces."

The comic who's spur of the moment insults and outlandish quips would tickle audiences coast to coast with laughter as long as you don't sit in the first row. Lieutenant Kelly questions a captured German Officer with a
shiny single bar of gold. This opens up a Pandora's box of adventure and war time comedy. I can't believe I had just written that line. Fact of the matter is Kelly's Heroes is the lighter side of war. Coming off two westerns Two Mules for Sister Sarah and Hang Em High, No nonsense squint eyed Clint Eastwood was thrown into this Anti-War comedy with a plethora of characters who seem to have you want to sign up and join the military. Eastwood plays an Ex-lieutenant who was scapegoated for a failed infantry attack captures a Nazi Colonel who in his possession has several Gold Bars. Eastwood gets the Wehrmacht Colonel drunk who becomes a klatschbase of information about a French town 30 miles behind enemy lines that houses almost two million dollars in gold. Kelly with nothing to lose wants the gold. Enter supply sergeant ""Crapgame "" Don Rickles who will supply the guns and ammunition needed for their journey east. Over hearing their plans is our scene stealer Donald Sutherland ""Oddball"" as the Gypsy type Hippie Tank commander with his band of renegades. Gavin McCloud as the skeptical Moriarty and always with the negative waves against the aloof and carefree Oddball is timing delight. The bridge scene is classic. To round out the search for gold invasion is the critical, cynical Telly Savalas as Big Joe who takes his troupe along. Rickles and Savalas argue more than a married couple throughout this film and it's a wonder those two didn't make more movies together. The most enjoyable part for me personally is riding along with the crazy Oddball with his tanks shooting paint and playing country music as they head into battle destroying a railroad depot. Sutherland's character as Oddball is an anachronism. Oddball is more of a Vietnam soldier than a World War II tank commander. In his Verbal expressions i.e. calling Big Joe an anti-social type. Three days of traveling and the advance of Kelly, Big Joe and Oddball caught the eye of the flamboyant General Colt (Carroll O'Connor) overhearing their walkie talkie broadcasts. Colt couldn't wait to ride in his jeep and decorate each and everyone of this renegade soldiers thinking they have good intentions of advancing to Berlin in final victory when in truth it's all about the Gold. Sutherland's performance is comical genius and in my opinion his best work. Weird to have Clint Eastwood in the middle of all this labyrinth of comedy but it works despite the negative waves. I grade this movie 6 mortar shells of laughter."

Kelly soon devises a plan and gathers a few other soldiers and supplies to try and take the gold for themselves.<br/><br/>The main reason why I watched this movie was that my Dad suggested it a few years ago, and he was eager enough to buy it on DVD so I didn't want to disappoint him. While I know this isn't one of my favorite movies, I still enjoyed it enough, which is strange since I don't really like military movies. Even though my Dad laughed at some scenes I just kind of snickered at, there were some genuinely funny parts from time to time, which surprised me because I thought it would be some serious, bland action movie.<br/><br/>My favorite character had to be Oddball, played by Donald Sutherland. By not saying anything specific, I thought he had the most laughs and stole the show for me as not only my favorite character, but the one I related to the most. He was laid back and liked to crack a joke, my favorite kind of people. I also found no real problems with anyone's acting, which is good for this all-star cast of people in this movie.<br/><br/>My only real complaint dialogue wise was that (at least the version I had) whenever German was spoken, there were no subtitles. Yes, some of it was pretty easy to comprehend without knowing what was being said, but I feel like some scenes would have benefited from the use of them. My only other real complaint was some of the pacing of the movie. At times, it felt like there were too many shots of people just standing around doing nothing or giving an exposition dump. And I know that every scene doesn't have to be an action scene, but I felt that some of them just dragged for a little bit longer than I wanted to.<br/><br/>Now lets go back to the positives, I loved the scenery in this movie! All of it looks beautiful and the sets look so realistic. I also liked the fact that there was only one song that would only play periodically. I think that was one of the movie's strengths, it didn't need music to tell you to be happy, or sad, or excited, you could get that based off of what was going on or the actor's expressions. But the song that they used was very catchy and I found myself singing it in my head the last time it was played. Overall, I would recommend this movie, but with the warning that it might not become your favorite movie, and that it's not a ""for everybody"" kind of movie."

A few plot holes, such as the value and weight of the gold, did not detract from the fun. The war action was played straight, and well-directed.

","During World War two, as with any war, treasure is where you find it. Few of the top brass ever shared or made public their ill gotten loot. Nevertheless, some opportunistic Allies and greedy but equally devious Germans realized if one discovered any treasure found in the field, the one thing necessary to keep it; was secrecy. In this film, an ex-Lieutenant, now private Kelly (Clint Eastwood), inadvertently captures a Nazi Colonel and takes him to the American lines. The initial purpose for the prisoner was to answer a few questions about an upcoming German town called Nancy to MSgt. Big Joe (Telly Savalas). However during a personal interrogation, Kelly learns the German was carrying instructions for the transportation and smuggling of Nazi gold. Learning its in a bank 30 miles behind enemy lines, Kelly decides to go for it. Help is assured when opportunists like supply SSgt. Crapgame (Don Rickles) Sgt. Oddball (Donald Sutherland), Moriaty (Gavin MacLeod), Little Joe (Stuart Margolin) and the rest of the platoon all volunteer to go for the gold. The bad parts to the scheme are multiple hurtles. One, the distance to the town is guarded by the German army. Second a Gung Ho Army commander named Maj. Gen. Colt plans to arrive at the same town with the entire division before Kelly and his private force get there. Finally, there are three awesome nearly invincible Tiger Tanks and 30-to-40 special troops guarding the bank where the gold is stored. To the general audience this movie is not only apt to become a military milestone, but due to its superb theme song, by the Mike Curb Congreation, will also become a lasting musical memory. The acting is superior, the wartime action extremely entertaining and the picture as a whole is nothing short of Classic. Highly Recommended to all audiences. *****"

","When Kelly (Eastwood) discovers a gold bar in the possession of a high-ranking German prisoner, he takes it upon himself to discover if ""there's more where that came from"". And boy, is there! <br/><br/>Kelly handpicks a few confidants which can help him retrieve this massive amount of Nazi gold being held in a small town behind enemy lines. Most everyone is easily convinced to join the effort when Kelly flashes his gold bar in their face with the promise of 14,000 more. It also helps that their commanding officer has given them 3 days of rest while he steals a Yacht (LOL!) and transports it (over land!) back to Paris! Along the way, the rogue group develops in to a veritable Army battalion, including ""Oddball"", a ""positive vibes"" hippie tank commander played hilariously by Donald Sutherland.<br/><br/>There's lots of fun and excitement to go around as we follow the gold-seekers across the enemy countryside and into the little town and its bank which is guarded by 3 very intimidating German tanks.<br/><br/>This movie never takes itself too seriously, and so we forgive many of the unrealistic scenarios, and just enjoy the ride! The film is equal parts a war film, comedy, and adventure. Great entertainment, great cast, and lots of fun!"

","I saw this when it first came out in the theaters and have loved it ever since. Seen it many times on TV. What a great ensemble cast with Clint Eastwood, Donald Sutherland, Telly Savala, Carroll O' Connor, don Rickles, Gavin Macleod and Harry Dean Stanton among others. What's remarkable is that Director Brian G. Hutton and writer Troy Kennedy Martin came together to produce such a fine and funny film but never did much other memorable movie work. Hutton did some less-than-memorable films with some big name actors but most his success was with television. Hutton's only other memorable film was 1968's Where Eagles Dare. Martin too has success in television but not much on the big screen except for 1969's The Italian Job of which this is kind of an Italian Job part II-The War Years. This script has so many funny lines you have to see it twice to absurd it all. The character of the Sherman tank driver Oddball as a Hippy 25 years ahead of his time is brilliant with his positive and negative waves, Speakers on his tank cranking big band swing music, his passion for wine and cheese and catching rays. Eastwood's imposing big screen presence never gets in the way of the cast. Eastwood is of course there but he's less noticeable than in any other of his movies because of all the characters that are his Heroes. Eastwood runs this show with help from Savalas and O'Connor but Sutherland steals it and Rickles keeps it all together. I would give this a 9.5 of a possible 10 and highly recommend it."

When his platoon find out that their vacation will be at a ruined old farm far from any booze, broads or action, not to mention that it is a lot of gold we're talking about, they decide to join him in his enterprise. Along the way, Kelly recruits Oddball who volunteers his three Sheridan tanks to give them an edge...<br/><br/>As with any military operations, officially approved or not, there are some complications. First of all, you got to get past a lot of German troops, and second of all, your own army might not be very helpful either.<br/><br/>This is a very nice war movie. No costs seem to be spared. There a lot of vehicles and men, not as in some where you seem to miss a lot of men and an entire army seem to be made up by twenty men or so. But, not in this case, the armies are in full scale. Furthermore there are a lot of explosions, but they are well integrated into the story, and do not try to steal attention from the story, only enhance it. In addition, this movie sport a lot of comedy too with interesting characters and situations. The actors acts well with an honorable mention to Sutherland for Oddball. <br/><br/>In difference to a lot of other movies, this movie keeps a nice pace with the story. Many other movies make a nice introduction, then some chopped up scenes in the middle that leads to an spectacular end. This however, let these scenes in between act themselves out, which gives the movie a feeling of completeness.<br/><br/>A very good movie.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This film is really funny, with quirky characters, great dialogue and a *really* strong cast In fact, the cast sometimes saves this film from slipping into dreariness. A bit too long at 2h26, some scenes are simply unnecessary or too long. A good example is the General (a real waste of Carrol O'Connor's talents) A useless role, his scenes are all fairly useless, and could be pretty much wiped out of the film without changing it.<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland is a standout here, nearly as good as his portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce in M*A*S*H; his hippie artillery leader named Oddball' is a hilarious role played to near perfection! Clint Eastwood also plays his role, title character Kelley, to near perfection. A strong, solid character who counters Telly Savalas' big lug Big Joe' and Sutherland's Oddball' quite nicely. Don Rickles plays Don Rickles, so few surprises there. And the supporters are there purely to support the main three, which works out well (look for Harry Dean Stanton 9 years prior to Alien).<br/><br/>Considering it's not supposed to be taken seriously in the least, the impossibilities' in terms of characterization and certain props should be overlooked. There are some slightly glaring plot holes as well, but they don't really matter. This film is simply fun and should be enjoyed as such. 7/10."

My favorite part of the movie, and a scene that makes the whole movie worth while, is when Carrol O'Conner (playing an American General) is listening to the radio and overhears our heroes talking about pressing forward and cutting into German lines with all this enthusiasm.  So O'Conner gets all psyched up and is like 'that's the kind of spirit I'm talking about!'  Little does he know they are fighting their way forward to claim 16 million dollars in gold.

There's just one problem - the gold is behind German lines and in a bank. So what? Off our guys go to liberate this gold from the Nazis. By the middle of the film, there are a fair number of hangers-on who also want some of this gold. One of them is Oddball, played by Donald Sutherland. His is the funniest part and his character's name is well deserved. Even during some of the definitely non-funny combat scenes, he provides some comic relief.

"Dr_FIcta","1","3","13","5 August 2018"," ""Farms? In Berkeley? MOOOOO!""
","First time I've contributed to the IMDb reviews. Guess I'll start by weighing in on some films that I consider to be vastly overrated. This is one of them. I've decidedly got to go with the lowballers on KH-a movie that has 1970 written all over it. Indeed, how could a ""war"" film made in that year have been anything else?
Along with M*A*S*H and The Dirty Dozen (and to a lesser extent Patton), all of which stem from the period c. 1968-70, KH suffers from the 25-year lag syndrome, meaning that the producers, director, and actors aren't very connected to the time period anymore (cf. Hogan's Heroes). Also like DD and MASH, especially, it's an insult to the spirit of the time portrayed. This is basically Ocean's 11 warped back to WWII itself and seen through a haze of pot smoke. Come to think of it, ultra-cool Donald Sutherland is in ALL THREE films. Tells you something right there...."
"peterromero-40146","3","2","8","29 November 2018"," One of the more average of Eastwood's earlier screen roles.
","Kelly's Heroes is a wannabe. Clint Eastwood proves his lack of acting ability here in a script that is both overlong and arrogant. This movie was MADE for the 70s audience. There is no other explanation for Donald Sutherland's character and the amount of anti-establishment ho-haw. The plot itself lacks enough credibility for two movies. Yet, somewhere in this film is an intelligence beyond all the explosions and terrible quips. It certainly isn't in the Mike Curb Congregation's theme song, certainly one of the worst pop songs of the decade. There is no similarity between it and the movie, that's bad licensing. That problem aside, the film would have been much better had the editor not been snoozing on the job. Given the timeframe of this film, I will forgive the DoP for doing a slob-job."
"punishmentpark","5","2","8","5 July 2015"," This shouldn't have been a comedy.
","A lot of people like this one, apparently. I suppose it has much to do with the mostly terrific action scenes and the attention to detail, such as German soldiers who actually speak German for once. I suppose a lot of people also really love Donald Sutherland's part. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised when he finally showed up, but he later on takes his part way too far into overdrive - the same goes for Carroll O'Connor.<br/><br/>The premise is preposterous and morally reprehensible. How are we supposed to sympathize with this awful bunch that seems indifferent to the suffering of millions (""All we do is we fight and we die and for what?"" they even ask) and choose to steal an enormous load of gold, which in turn was most likely stolen by the Nazi's. Then there's the final destruction of the little French town where there's only a few citizens in sight, but when it's all over, there seem to be no casualties among the numerous villagers? Sure, sure. And striking a deal with a Nazi German in a tank (that isn't functional at one point, but when the doors of the bank are to be blown open, it suddenly works again?) and letting him drive away with part of the gold? And how is anyone going to get away with the loot unknown and unseen? That sh*t don't fly (no more), sorry.<br/><br/>Action-wise, you can not go wrong here, but I think it should have been way more grim and gritty, and they could have pretty much skipped the comedy altogether. Then, there could have been a seriously reckoning for this military crew that does not take the saving of nations in ultimate distress seriously.<br/><br/>Still, a lot of pretty sweet action scenes, so 5 out of 10."
"filipemanuelneto","6","1","3","21 April 2020"," A satire that uses a war to criticize all wars.
","This is one of the strangest war films I have ever seen. It is a strongly ironic comedy, where a group of American soldiers practically deserted from the ranks to pursue a German column that they know is carrying an astronomical value of gold bullions. This is, of course, a major parody of World War II, made in the context of the 1970s, the sexual revolution and protests against another war: Vietnam. In fact, this is the only way for this film to be understood.<br/><br/>I read some criticisms and texts by other authors (I sometimes do that to document myself, and learn more about the film I am going to see) and some of them qualified this film as an anachronism, or using a lot of anachronisms. I don't fully agree. In fact, the film presents several anachronisms, such as the amount of military material used that was made after World War II, but what stands out is the general environment of protest or neglect of the war, and anti-patriotic insubordination. For me, an anachronism happens when something from another time period is used in a film as if it were really a thing that existed at that moment... but if those soldiers had done, in real life, half of the things they did or said in the film, would have been taken to Court Martial and maybe even executed. This is so obvious to me that I don't even consider it an anachronism. It is, instead, a satire. Satire happens when we distort a reality for the purpose of humor, or humorous criticism. This film took advantage of the World War to convey criticisms against the war and to question the value and importance of war ... a somewhat discreet way to align with the anti-war thinking of most young Americans, to whom the film is directed. The character Oddball, by Donald Sutherland, is the one that most embodies the spirit of this generation, thanks to his relaxed and negligent manners, abstaining from fighting, in addition to his long hair (unacceptable in a military environment) and even exchanging uniforms with SS soldiers.<br/><br/>Sutherland is a good actor and clearly stands out throughout the film, making a good counterpoint to Clint Eastwood, who is more serious. I confess that I am not a fan of Eastwood, but he was fine. Don Rickles, Telly Savalas and Stuart Margolin also do a good job and help the two main actors to shine. At a technical level, the film has some problems, starting with the exaggerated length. I would have taken advantage of the editing to remove about 45 minutes from the film. Cinematography is good and there was clearly an effort to use military material and credible props, but that effort was not always successful. Finally, we must mention the good special and sound effects and a very interesting soundtrack, all in the style of the 70s.<br/><br/>This is a satirical comedy film. As such, we have to dissociate him a little from the historical truth and open ourselves to what he brings us. It is the easiest and most sensible way to understand it. It's not a good movie, and there are much better comedies out there. But it is not terrible."

The most obviously inappropriate character is pseudo-hippie Donald Sutherland (as Oddball), but Don Rickles and others area also misplaced. The action consists of character actors shouting their lines amid explosions, to which Eastwood plays straight man. A sequence involving land mines, including a gun battle, is very skillfully done; momentarily, the film is lifted. It does get back to basics, those being loud character actors and fiery explosions.

He is the same cool, calm and collected character that he is known for in all of his work. I was a little worried about Rickles in the beginning but he played his part well with sharp comedic wit and the neuroticism that you might expect.

"krazykiter","10","1","3","1 January 2009"," Still great nearly forty years later
","This film is so highly underrated precisely because it combines so many things so well. It's not strictly a war movie, buddy movie, comedy or political satire. It is ALL of those things. It is best described as a playfully satirical action/caper movie set against the backdrop of World War 2.<br/><br/>The film relies on irony, satire and just a bit of farce for its humor as opposed to today's unfortunate predilection toward slapstick, potty humor or sexual innuendo. This allows the action to punctuated by subtle bits of humor throughout without detraction. For example, Crapgame and Willard unknowingly taking cover behind a latrine which collapses on top of them when a nearby building explodes (with predictable aromatic consequences), or the scene where the unit is strafed by an aircraft and a soldier runs out of the bushes unaware of what happened because he was relieving himself.<br/><br/>The other aspect that makes this so enjoyable are the characters and the actors that portrayed them. Eastwood's stoicism and Savalas' portrayal of Big Joe the harried, frustrated platoon sergeant make them the perfect straight men for the other zany characters to play off of. Rickles' caustic wit is on full display as the conniving Crapgame. Carrol O'Conner is superb as the bombastic Patton-esquire General Colt. And can enough be said about Donald Sutherland's completely over-the-top portrayal of the totally anachronistic hippie tank commander, Oddball? The character is presented so well and Sutherland does such a wonderful job with it, it becomes eminently plausible that such an out-of-place character could have existed.<br/><br/>Even actors in the supporting roles such as Gavin McLeod and Harry Dean Stanton (among others) turn in wonderful performances. This makes every man in the outfit a unique person instead just being cannon-fodder for the combat scenes, so you really end up rooting for them to pull it off.<br/><br/>All in all, it is just a great bit of storytelling, which is why it has endured for so long and will endure for quite some time."

","Whilst going against the genre of Where Eagles Dare, The Great Escape, The Guns of Navarone, Dirty dozen etc, this may or not be black comedy, but it's an enjoyable film nonetheless. The great Clint Eastwood followed as equally by NCO (Do they say that in the 'States?) Savalas, Sutherland et al, show what a motley crew can and will do if there's money to be made amongst the 'sideline' of WWII!<br/><br/>It beckons a smaller role Savalas played in 'The Battle of the Bulge', as a spiv-black market-type NCO character, turned into something bigger by this film.<br/><br/>Nice action scenes, especially with the dedicated nazi in his Tiger tank blowing everything up and then being humbled into turning his turret onto the bank to gain the lolly. Sutherland, being a complete nutter, often steals the show being a tank commander and a kind of 1940's 'misplaced hippy' to boot and the 'western style' approach into town by him, Eastwood and Savalas is still a treat, capitalising at this time of Eastwood's spaghetti westerns.<br/><br/>A rip-roaring tribute to some good American actors and a bunch of misfits making something for themselves from the war.

","""Kelly's Heroes"" works, to some degree, as a war movie not for the ""Greatest Generation"" of World War II but the Woodstock/Vietnam mentality of its day, released as it was the same year as ""Patton"" and ""MASH"".<br/><br/>It's 1944, and as an American infantry unit is about to be pulled out of the line of combat in France, a soldier named Kelly (Clint Eastwood) discovers Wehrmacht troops have stashed a fortune in gold bars in a town still days ahead of the Allied advance. He proposes his comrades join him in a commando-style raid designed to take the gold away from the Nazis and pocket it themselves, before the rest of the American Army can.<br/><br/>Eastwood and director Brian G. Hutton, who collaborated two years before in the near-classic, more straight-laced World War II adventure yarn ""Where Eagles Dare"", lend ""Kelly's Heroes"" much of its polish, but it's Eastwood's C-list co-stars who give the film its character. You could call this ""Battle Of The Network Stars"" for all the future American TV series mainstays on hand for this enterprise.<br/><br/>Telly Savalas (""Kojak"") is Big Joe, a sergeant and nominal leader of Kelly's group. Don Rickles (""CPO Sharkey"" and a ton of Dean Martin roasts) is Crapgame, a conniving quartermaster. Stuart Margolin of ""The Rockford Files"" is one of the soldiers, and Carroll O'Connor, Archie Bunker himself, is the meathead U.S. general who thinks Kelly's boys just got a burst of patriotic spirit.<br/><br/>The TV mojo is harder to ignore when one realizes there was a series on CBS at the same time as this movie's release with a very similar name: ""Hogan's Heroes"".<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed Savalas' performance as the one guy in Kelly's outfit, including probably Kelly himself, with thoughts for the men's larger welfare. A better film would have made more of this tension, instead of deferring to the bigger star. Savalas so often played the heavy, yet he does compassion well here, in small, Sgt. Rock-like doses.<br/><br/>""You're pressing these guys' luck and they only got so much of it left,"" he tells Kelly. ""It's a long, long way to Berlin, and they're going to need every inch of that luck before this cockamamie war is over.""<br/><br/>Many of the other actors, namely O'Connor, Margolin and future ""Love Boat"" skipper Gavin MacLeod, play their parts very broadly, contributing to the confusion of whether ""Kelly's Heroes"" is comedy or war drama. On the one hand, people do get killed. On the other, there's a lot of jokey dialogue. ""That nut has got to be nuts"", Big Joe says of Kelly. Or when Crapgame finds a mine and is asked what kind: ""The kind that blows up!""<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland (also a sitcom star, indirectly, via Alan Alda) is especially off-the-charts as Oddball, a hippie tank commander, preening and mugging for the camera with odd abandon. Yet he entertains with his kooky relish, and in that way becomes something of an avatar for the charm of ""Kelly's Heroes"" itself, a subversive vehicle for delivering the visceral thrills of cinema combat while questioning the reasons for war in the first place.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that ""Kelly's Heroes"" is supposed to be subversive; Eastwood and Hutton apparently say it was until the producers reworked it. Perhaps the producers had the right idea. ""Patton"" was the subversive antiwar film of its day; ""Kelly's Heroes"" is a just an amiable caper film that never pushes its luck too far."

Between Lalo Schifrin's seventies music and Donald Sutherland's laid back personality and hippie language, I thought at first I was seeing a Viet Nam flick. But this is a pretty good caper film. (How in the world a private overstepped a sergeant I'll never know. That's another way the plot strains credibility.) Yes, a private (Clint Eastwood) was giving orders to superior officers in their quest to get 16,000 gold bars from a bank behind enemy lines shortly after D-Day. He probably got court martialed for insubordination when he got back to the states, but the movie doesn't tell us. Guess we'll never know.<br/><br/>By and large, this movie is amusing, but the anachronistic language and soundtrack, as well as the chain of command in this scheme, strains credibility. Telly Savalis is hilarious as Big Joe, and Clint Eastwood kind of underplays his roll a bit until he starts hatching up this scheme. Don Rickles is his usual sarcastic self, and Donald Sutherland is from La-la-land. The video box cover says that he was probably the first hippie. Whatever. If there really was a guy like that fighting with our boys during World War II, his fellow soldiers would have ragged his ass to the dogs and back. And a pre-Archie Bunker Caroll O'Connor is a hoot as the general who intercepts their scheme on the radio and gives them medals for taking initiative during combat because he thinks they're pushing deep into enemy territory.<br/><br/>Very entertaining if you just enjoy the ride and don't think too much. 7 out of 10."

","This movie ultimately did not succeed with me, because it is a story that takes place in the forties, but is told using the sentimentalities of the sixties.<br/><br/>How else could you explain the presence of hippies and yippies during WWII? When Donald Sutherland starts talking about ""negative waves"", I had just about seen enough.  There is no way a character like this could have existed during the forties.<br/><br/>It also shows a ""troubled, do it my own way"" character being the lead, which for 1970 was not that common.<br/><br/>Other than that, it is a pretty standard, formulaic picture.  Good performances from all except Sutherland, and Carroll O'Connor is way over the top.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

","When American soldier Kelly (Clint Eastwood) learns of a fortune in Nazi gold being stored in a bank behind enemy lines, he organises a mission to relieve the Germans of their treasure.<br/><br/>With a fun premise, a proven director in Brian G. Hutton (Where Eagles Dare) and a terrific ensemble cast, Kelly's Heroes could have been a hugely enjoyable WWII 'men on a mission'/crime caper, but winds up being an irritating mess of a movie due to its screwball comedy, its 'futility of war' subtext, and its late-'60s/early '70s hippie spirit, most evident in its madcap characters, of which the most oddball is even called 'Oddball' (played by Donald Sutherland).<br/><br/>The flower-power affectations and anti-war message reflect the peace movement of the day and many Americans' sentiments about the Vietnam war, which was in full swing at the time. However, the tone is so completely at odds with the WWII setting that it makes for a very awkward movie. Had they done away with the anachronistic counterculture vernacular and the screwball 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' approach, and made Kelly's Heroes an authentic war movie, I would have enjoyed it a whole lot more.<br/><br/>The catchy theme song 'Burning Bridges', sung by the Mike Curb Congregation with music by Lalo Schifrin, is reminiscent of 'The Self Preservation Society', the theme song from the previous year's The Italian Job, which was written by Kelly's Heroes' writer Troy Kennedy Martin and also revolved around a daring gold heist. The Italian Job is far better than Kelly's Heroes.<br/><br/>3.5/10, rounded down to 3 for Sutherland's hugely annoying performance."
"jackasstrange","7","1","4","19 November 2013"," Worthy a watch, but isn't so good.
","Kelly's Heroes is not a funny film at all. In fact, it's kinda hard to make a war film with comedy tones. Sure Donald Sunderland cartoon esque character was weird, but not funny into the context of the film. The premise is very outdated and apparently from a Spaghetti Sergio Leone western _The Good,the bad and the Ugly_ it was to enter in a quest for gold beyond the enemy lines. The gold was hidden in a bank, of course, instead of buried in the sand.<br/><br/>Although it has some great moments when it isn't trying to be funny(fail). Some fight and shootouts scenes were really great. Apocalypse Now obviously got some inspirations from this film, as the scene where the mad characters play music while destroying a village. <br/><br/>The art design was very inconsistent. Sometimes great, sometimes poor. So were the cinematography. The filming commenced in July 1969 and was completed in December and was shot on location in the Istrian village of Viinada in the former Yugoslavia and London. Yugoslavia was chosen mostly because earnings from previous showings of movies there could not be taken out of the country, but could be used to fund the production.<br/><br/>The music in this film is one of the best aspects of this film so far. The film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Lalo Schifrin and the soundtrack album was released on the MGM label in 1970.<br/><br/>This is an average film overall, but very worth watching. 7.3/10"

","Before there was ""Saving Private Ryan"" there was ""Kelly's Heroes."" In both movies a sensitive but tough commander is asked to risk his men's lives on a mission that makes no sense whatsoever. But instead of having to bring back Matt Damon safe to his mama, Sergeant Big Joe (Telly Savalas) is asked to rob a bank in a provincial French town, which may or may not have $16 million in Nazi gold. Clint Eastwood is Kelly, the brainy operator who uncovers the trail of the gold, and he's aided and abetted by Sergeant Crapgame (Don Rickles), a behind-the-scenes black market dealer, and Oddball (Donald Sutherland), a spaced-out tank commander. This film is cheerfully anachronistic in projecting sixties style, attitude, and cynicism onto the 1940s. Every man is thoroughly unpatriotic, disillusioned with the system, and out for himself. Is this really World War II, or is it Vietnam? Sutherland's character is a hippie before hippies were invented. That having been said, let me assure you I love this movie. It is a total joy from beginning to end. Capitalizing off the success of ""The Dirty Dozen,"" it seeks to recreate the formula with some of the same actors (Savalas, Sutherland). The film is chock-full of familiar faces from film and TV: Carroll O'Connor, Gavin McLeod, and even the ubiquitous Harry Dean Stanton (billed as Dean Stanton). Shot in Yugoslavia, the film successfully exploits Eastwood's iconic status in spaghetti westerns: the scene where Eastwood, Savalas, and Sutherland confront the SS tank commander who is the only thing standing between them and the gold is a witty send-off of Sergio Leone. ""Kelly's Heroes"" is a near-perfect mixture of comedy, action, and male bonding. Perhaps the ultimate redneck movie."
"Uriah43","5","1","5","30 May 2019"," In Search of Gold Behind Enemy Lines
","While on a routine reconnaissance mission an American soldier by the name of ""Kelly"" (Clint Eastwood) captures a German colonel and discovers a bar of gold inside the briefcase he is carrying. After further interrogation Kelly learns that there are a lot more of them in a bank not too far from where his platoon is currently located. Needless to say, this interests him greatly but the problem for him is that this bank is located behind enemy lines. So to meet this difficult challenge he gathers a motley bunch of soldiers within his platoon to secretly liberate the gold from the Germans without the knowledge of his American superiors. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had a number of talented actors which included not only Clint Eastwood but also Telly Savalas (as ""Big Joe""), Don Rickles (""Crapgame""), Donald Sutherland (""Oddball"") and Carroll O'Connor (""General Colt""). Yet despite the decent cast and interesting plot, I didn't think the film itself was nearly as good as it could have been in large part due to the performance of Donald Sutherland's character who was clearly mismatched for the time period in question. That being said, while I have little doubt that the nonchalant attitude displayed would have been better understood and appreciated during the Vietnam Conflict-or possibly even the Korean War-it seemed rather weird here. But perhaps that's just me. In any case, while this film wasn't too bad I also think it was clearly overrated and for that reason I have given it a value more clearly in line with my views. Average."

","This is one of the worst war movies I've ever seen, not to say one of the worst comedies. (Worst than The Great Escape, which was an insult to the poor fellows who had to endure the Nazi prison camps). Hollywood, until Band of Brothers, has always been incapable of making a realistic WW2 movie, with some exceptions like Stalag 17, and of course Schindler's List, despite some of its Hollywood manners -money talks-). Germans, in Hollywood movies, are always dumb and stupid, ridicule and cruel, and war itself is seen as of some kind of a computer game. To say, as some did in these reviews, that this is a good movie, you have to be no more than 13, and seen nothing yet in serious movies. <br/><br/>It has only one real thing going for it: looting, raping, robbing and indulging in the pleasure of killing fellow humans, has always been the big incentive for recruiting soldiers. War is pure hell and Americans had a taste of it in 9/11. But for Hollywood nothing is sacred, and no theme is sweet enough to satisfy the taste of the public for sugared food. Reading the vast positive reviews of this film made me uncomfortable, since it gives Hollywood a go-ahead in this kind of work. Sure, someday there will be a Hollywood comedy about 9/11, which the public, like in this movie, will find great and one of the best ever made!<br/><br/>No more than a 4. (I'd have given a 2, but because Donald and Telly did the entire acting job, I raise it to four. Sorry if my review offends the vast majority of you, cinéphiles.)"

","I had heard many people say that this was a really good film, so I decided I couldn't give it a miss, and I can see reasons to recommend it. Set in the Second World War, the Americans have captured a German Colonel, but an artillery barrage hits the camp before they can talk to him. Ex-Lieutenant Pvt. Kelly (Clint Eastwood) catches the Colonel, and he gets him drunk, this is how he learns of a secret mission he can go on to ship $16,000,000 worth of gold bullion that is meant to go to France. Kelly invites many of his fellow soldiers that are interested in being part of this mission to slip into enemy territory and get this fortune. As they travel, they encounter one or two small battles, a mine field and a few near misses, before the final bigger battle in a town square, where the gold is, but it was kind of obvious they would get the gold and live richly ever after (LOL). Also starring On Her Majesty's Secret Service's Telly Savalas as MSgt. Big Joe, Toy Story's Don Rickles as SSgt. Crapgame, Carroll O'Connor as Maj. Gen. Colt, Donald Sutherland as Sgt. Oddball (tank commander), Gavin MacLeod as Moriarty (tank crewman), Hal Buckley as Capt. Maitland, Stuart Margolin as Pvt. Little Joe, Jeff Morris as Pvt. Cowboy, Richard Davalos as Pvt. Gutowski, Perry Lopez as Pvt. Petuko, Tom Troupe as Cpl. Job and Harry Dean Stanton as Pvt. Willard.

","'Kelly's Heroes' is a World War Two film about a group of soldiers who go to steal Nazi treasures, and they fight the Germans along the way. It's got battles and comedy, and it's a pretty good film if you're just after some military-related fun. It also has a pretty good soundtrack with the song ""Burning Bridges"". It's certainly a different take on a war film, and there isn't another film quite like it. (Sure, ""Big Red One"" was another comedy World War 2 film, but I think it lacked the substance.) The insane character (I forget his name as it has been a while since I last saw this) is very funny, and there is some good fun with Germans in the film too. The only problem that I had with the film is that it moved a little slow, and it's really a film about the comedy than it is a masterpiece. As a film, it's about average. If you like war films, you will enjoy it, and you'll enjoy the humour too."
"drystyx","7","0","1","15 January 2020"," Unique story, lead characters done well, others not
","This war film combines some comedy with drama with pathos with a crime caper.<br/><br/>It is unique. Kelly (Eastwood) is a busted lieutenant, who is now under Joe (Savalas) in a squad of GIs in WWII in the European theater. They have survived the D Day beach massacre, and are one of the more persecuted units in their company.<br/><br/>They combine with Oddball (Sutherland) and others to steal Gold from a bank in occupied territory that is about to be abandoned. Roughly $18,000,000 in Gold bars is for grabs.<br/><br/>The strength of the movie is the relationship of the lead characters, the ""Beatle"" characters so to speak. When two men get together, one is ""John"", and one is ""Paul"", and when three get together, another is ""George"", who is clearly the spiritual tank commander Oddball. The ""Ringo"" is a combination of other GIs, most notably the ones played by Gavin McLeod of Mary Tyler Moore fame, and Alien victim Harry Dean Stanton.<br/><br/>Which is John and which is Paul? John is usually seen as loud and boisterous, and Paul as quiet, but that is misleading. John is also the more reckless, more risk taking, less caring, more snobbish, more mercantile one, while Paul is the one who is more likely to keep everyone safe.<br/><br/>That makes Kelly the ""John"" figure and Savalas a total change of his usual character as the more rational ""Paul"" figure.<br/><br/>In fact, even though Oddball comes across as kooky, even he is saner than Kelly. Both he and Joe are more rational, more strategic, more open minded, than Kelly.<br/><br/>Kelly isn't a sadist, though. There is no such thing as a psychopath. That is a concoction of Psychiatrists in what is presently the darkest age of mental health. Mental health professionals need a safety zone in their dark age belief that there is no evil, so they wrongly state that some people don't feel empathy with others. Anyone from the hood knows different. Some are mercantile souls who have a goal and then try to obtain the goal, hoping no one is hurt, but living with it. Others are sadists whose first goal is actually causing suffering of others, and then pretend to have a goal of greed or envy in order to accomplish that goal. In either case, both do know that people in pain are in pain.<br/><br/>Kelly is the mercantile soul. He has a goal of taking Gold, and is willing to share it. He doesn't want others to suffer, but he's willing to kill hundreds of German soldiers to get it, because he simply figures he's going to kill enemy soldiers any way, so why not get something for it?<br/><br/>Carroll O'Conner provides the best comedy of the movie as a general who is out of touch with the troops.<br/><br/>The movie does have weaknesses. The weaknesses boil down mostly to one: dehumanization of the supporting characters. Aside from the ""Beatle"" characters, few characters are treated with any dignity, and most are caricatures, particularly a stereotypical crud played by Don Rickles.<br/><br/>The GIs are totally invulnerable, and bullets find very few of them, even though they never miss German targets. While German soldiers have always been the biggest whipping post of Hollywood, this is one of the worst cases of dehumanization. Hollywood even treats American Indians with more dignity, as they are always treated with respect in cavalry films, and lose mostly because they have spears and arrows against repeating rifles. German soldiers are certainly the whipping post boys of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Here, the kill count is even more ridiculous than ""The Dirty Dozen"", if you can believe that is possible.<br/><br/>While the movie seems to poke fun at characters, it never pokes fun at itself, and tries to come off as credible, which it isn't. The best movies are good because of credible supporting characters. This one lacks that for the most part, as most are clowns meant for cannon fodder, and totally ""contrived"" in ""contrived"" circumstances.<br/><br/>However, the movie is very watchable. It is well directed and filmed, with a logical sequence of events, and no lulls. There is bit of pathos, most notably in the mine field. There are some good elements, and it's basically a likable movie if one concentrates on the three lead characters alone. However, it isn't likable if one looks at how the supporting characters are so contrived."

People migrating to El Paso would say, in Spanish, that they were going ""pa' El Chuco"". These migrants became known as Pachucos.

","I first saw Kelly's Heroes when I was a college student working as a bus boy at the Grand Teton National Park in 1973. That dates me somewhat. At the time, it was a good movie. As the years have passed, the essence of the movie has grown on me. By today's standards, I realize the pace of the movie is sort of slow. The scene where the group is trying to convince Sarge (Telly Savalas) to go, you could time with the minute hand of a watch, for instance. But, in a way, that is the beauty of it. You actually get to see someone act, rather than just admire a good and tight edit job. This is a movie that I love to return to and watch over and over again. It doesn't grow old. I watched it with my 24 year old -- the same age as me when I first saw it -- last night. He was gripped with the cliff hangers the same as I was so long ago, wondering how things would turn out and willing to ask the questions that ultimately have good answers. The social/political commentary is as fresh today as it was during the Viet Nam era during which it was produced. It's also delightful to watch Donald Sutherland as a young actor who was, if not totally goofy in the movie, at least as good as his name (Oddball). To think that he is now sort of a seasoned classic actor! It blows the mind. If you want an oldie that has aged well, Kelly's Heroes won't let you down.

The first time I saw it I did not mind it, except for the Oddball guy.  Anyways not one of Eastwoods better one, but not awful either 6/10."
