","First of all, it is an Adam Sandler movie. If you hate Adam Sandler movies, then you won't like this.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8/10 because it was one of the better Adam Sandler movies. The plot and storyline was better than I expected; the development was pretty good as well. There were definitely a lot of points where I had to slap my forehead b/c it was silly funny.<br/><br/>Yeah, its highly unrealistic, but if you expected realism, whats wrong with you? Sure, Jennifer Anniston is the ""uglier chick,"" which is like saying a million dollars isn't that much money, but she did a good job in the movie.<br/><br/>The only complaint I had was Adam Sandler used all the lines I planned on using with the girl I took to see it!"

","I'm a bloke of 32. I took the other half to watch this last night as I do enjoy Comedy's. Not much of a cinema goer as tend to be the one saying 'ooh I knew I wanted to see that' when the film gets released and then completely forget to actually go.<br/><br/>I was in absolute stitches watching this, it's by far the funniest film I've seen in a long-long time. Normally watching a comedy I'd chuckle and laugh a bit but I was actually laughing out loud almost the whole film - as were a most of the other viewers in the cinema.<br/><br/>I do like (as my missus puts it) 'stupid comedy's' like; Anchor Man, Dodgeball and Hear no Evil See No Evil etc. so this is where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>I think the whole cast was near on perfect with Adam Sandler providing hilarious moments throughout, with Jenifer Aniston sexier and funnier than I've ever known her to be. if you watch the film you'll know that Dolf Lungren was side splitting at times and The kids worked really well especially Keekee-D's Mary Poppins English Accent!.... Oh and not to fortget the beautiful blonde :)<br/><br/>All in all an absolute hoot and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>Would have given it a 10/10 but nothings perfect :) so its a 9/10 from me.<br/><br/>ps. Just go with it hit the spot so much that this is the first film review I have ever done!"

","I've seen almost all of Jennifer Aniston's movies and most of them I really did not like. So my expectations of ""Just go with it"" were very low. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was laughing with tears in my eyes the first 20min of watching this movie and I didn't stop laughing till the screen showed black.<br/><br/>Al though the movie almost is 2 hours long, I wasn't bored at any time. The story was well written, the acting was amazing and hilarious and it was original in it's jokes. It did have a typical ending, but for once it didn't bother me because of the good build up in the story and the development of the characters.<br/><br/>If you do have a weakness for typical comedy movies, but can't seem to find a good one these days, definitely check out this one: laughter guaranteed!"
"lavoie7","8","91","147","12 February 2011"," Just go with it
","If you are looking for a highly intellectual movie, forget it. This is a simple movie with a simple story line and simple jokes. However, if you like to go to the movies just to break the routine, to have some laughs, and to change your mind, this is an excellent movie. Most highly critical people looking for perfection will give this movie a bad review, no doubt. People who gave an 8 to True Grit will not appreciate this movie...<br/><br/>Acting is excellent. Jennifer Aniston is perfect in that role; this is her best performance in a movie so far, except maybe for Marley and Me. Adam Sandler is much more natural than usual. He does not have to deliver all of the stupid jokes, and has a to act his role during most of the movie. I would say this is an equivalent performance as in 50 First Dates, or even better. He is very funny (as usual), but also compassionate and lovable. Nick Swardson is the clown of the movie, which allows Sandler to act more and leave some of the funny stuff to others. Swardson made me and my whole family laugh out loud during many parts of the movie. In fact, it had been a long time since I heard my two teenagers laugh so much and so loudly during a movie.<br/><br/>The two kids are really good supporting actors. They bring a lot to the movie. They make the situation more complicated a few times in unexpected ways. Bailee Madison is very impressive. We will see her again and often.<br/><br/>The normal cast of Happy Madisson movies are all there for their usual 2 minutes and all bring their own laugh. One of them made me swallow water in my lungs! He is good! I will let you guess which one.<br/><br/>All and all, we left very satisfied and happy we had this family night, even the teenagers. No frustration like we had in True Grit and no disappointment like we had in Sanctum. This was better than expected and worth its money. Just sit down and ""Go with it!""."

"Cunnilingilator","Null","147","266","7 September 2010"," The Adam Sandler Formula Works Again
","Just saw at this an advanced screening in Huntington Beach. <br/><br/>It was pretty damn good. I do have to admit that I am an Adam Sandler fan. Being 21, I grew up seeing his films in theaters and for the most part liked them all. I think with Big Daddy, Dennis Dugan and Adam Sandler's Happy Madison crew really started a formula of movie. Central conflicted and imperfect character Adam (who has a good heart of course), falls in love with the girl of his dreams, who is younger and way better looking than him, all formulated around a specific central premise (i.e. with this film it's Adam's lies piling on top of lies) supported by extremely strong, quirky side character performances. This might be the epitome of this established formula, really passing 50 First Dates in my opinion. The typical Sandler ridiculous humor and smart-ass remarks are extremely well balanced with perfectly timed and executed emotional moments. The set-up for the story is pretty basic and at first almost appears predictable. It is to some extent, but the crazy directions the movie takes based on Sandler's lies is well done and only stretches a few times. But what do you expect from the Happy Madison crew? <br/><br/>The 2 kids in the film did a good job and had some funny lines. I am not a Jennifer Aniston fan at all but really actually liked her in this. I sort of understand her popularity and charm after this movie. She seemed more genuine and I felt an emotional attachment to her that I have always lacked with her. Plus, she is showcased in a particular waterfall scene and looks absolutely fantastic in a bikini. Brooklyn Decker is unbelievably gorgeous, as we all know from the SI Swimsuit Edition, but I was very surprised at how natural of an actress she was. She seemed very comfortable and didn't overact much. She is extremely cute and lovable. Nicole Kidman and Dave Mathews were great as an uber cool couple. Nicole was a bit over the top as she has been of late (like since Moulin Rouge), but thats what her character called for so I understand. Dave was surprisingly good as an almost drugged up yuppie, cool boyfriend of Nicole's. Nick Swardson was absolutely hilarious and by far steals every scene he is in. He really comes into the movie about 1/3 of the way in and from there on out its his movie. Nick Swardson deserves fame for this.<br/><br/>I can't say for sure how the critics will receive it. I can handle suspension of disbelief as long as it leads to a funny payoff. For the most part these moments are delivered. It's a great date movie and a great movie for Sandler fans. He has an unbelievable recent track record for success, but this will top all of them at the box office."

","Huge fan of Adam Sandler except a few that are ""poop"" so I'm surprised I didn't see this one cause it's pretty good!

Good entertainment for a couple hours not much to judge."
"jantoniou","6","20","30","20 June 2011"," Likable Sandler-fare, as usual
","Adam Sandler is getting pretty solid at producing and acting in quasi-poignant tales that get him somewhat further away - and, ultimately, closer to (doesn't make sense, I know) - from his proto-Sandler-style of filmmaking that has his vaguely proto-typical cast of characters - hapless, hopeless geeks, improbable ladies' man, a ""nice guy"" that all the ladies want, but still seem to settle on the douches. Sandler brings his ""crew"" together - former/current SNLers, Allen Covert (who is pretty much in every Sandler movie that I can think of), and some heavy-hitters occasionally. ""The Wedding Singer,"" ""Grown-Ups,"" and, now, ""Just Go With It"" all pander to this amiable style of film-making that is at times borderline gross-out - but just pulls away before you realize this probably isn't an Apatow-slacker movie, nor is attempting to be.<br/><br/>Sandler is a plastic surgeon who long ago accidentally discovered he could play the ""my wife is a terrible person who abuses me"" card to score with hot chicks at the bar. Fact is he's not actually married - he and/or his wife left him at the altar many years before when he discovered she really didn't like him - but he's become so comfortable with lying to score with the chicks he just doesn't care - or seem to. Jennifer Aniston is his office assistant, a sweet, single gal with 2 kids. She doesn't much care for how he deals with the ladies, but she still likes him because she sees what a sweet guy he really is under the surface of his rather devious womanizing that all starts with a lie.<br/><br/>Sandler meets the bounteous and beautiful - and, very young - Brooklyn Decker at a party. They sleep together on the beach and in the morning Decker discovers he's ""married."" Sandler immediately throws a lie out there - he IS in fact, married (wait, no he's not, but it's all a lie anyway) but he's in the process of getting a divorce because his relationship with his wife - again, playing the same card - is very bad. Decker somehow believes him and off we go with the rest of the movie where Aniston agrees to be his fake wife and ultimately go off on a vacation with Decker, Sandler, Aniston's kids, and Nick Swanson as the court jester/boob (basically a version of Rob Schneider from Sandler's other ""Happy Madison"" movies) who pretends to be Aniston's boyfriend.<br/><br/>There are a lot of funny setups and jokes - enough to enjoy the movie, for sure, even if they do clearly seem to be Sandler-ish in their obviousness. Hey, he's a plastic surgeon, let's see where we might milk that. Decker is half his and Aniston's age - let's see where we might milk that. Swanson is an often over-the-top boob - let's see where we can grab some silly jokes there. Aniston's kids - the daughter, especially - are good for quite a few laughs as well.<br/><br/>I half expected Decker to be pretty bad, but she does just fine. She is playing against top comedic talent here - though honestly Sandler nearly seems on auto-pilot in most of his movies - and nowhere is Jessica Simpson-like delivery in evidence. It hardly needs to be said she is being used for her looks more than her supposed talent, but her ability to transcend the ""Hey, I'm just here to be a C-cup blond bimbo in a bikini"" obviousness of her role is commendable. Sandler is notorious - or very successful, depending on your perspective - in bringing in at least one or two pieces of eye candy to most of his films, but in a manner that is less blatant or purely perverse. Yes, Sandler likes hiring hot chicks, but he also likes the good/nice guy to have a shot with her, which makes most of us nerds feel at least a little bit more hopeful. Decker and Aniston both of course fill this role, quite well.<br/><br/>While clearly not an intentional Oscar-winner, Sandler proves he is again capable of making a funny, somewhat poignant, generally enjoyable PG-13-bordering-on-R-rated film."

","My wife and I watched this movie on Valentines Day. The way we decided on this movie was that we watched trailers for all the movies in our theater and this one stood out by far as the best.<br/><br/>Once we started watching this movie I realized that this actually was gonna be a good pick for Valentines Day. It was a very well done Romantic-Comedy. I was just suspecting a full out comedy but was happy that the movie was the way it was even though I normally dislike most R-C's.<br/><br/>The cast worked excellent together. Sandler was funny as usual and meshed very well with Jennifer Aniston. Nick Swardson is always a funny guy and lives up to that in this movie. Brooklyn Decker played her part to a tee, and the children added just the right touch to every scene they were in.<br/><br/>This movie was a winner in my book. I am usually much more critical but there was just something about it. I will be at least renting when this comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray. Who knows...maybe i'll spend the $20 and buy this one. Go see it!

","If you're looking for a good laugh, I highly recommend this movie. You'll definitely enjoy it with your friends or your family. If I want to watch a comedy, I'm not critical about anything, if the movie can make me laugh then I'm good. I know what I was expecting when I went to see this movie but I wasn't expecting that it was going to make me laugh that hard!<br/><br/>This movie has heart, it deals with friendship and family. It's like 50 First Dates and then some, and then some more. It's not your typical boy-meets-girl romantic-comedy either, it doesn't focus on the lead characters alone. Here, you'll see the supporting characters, and their relationships grow with the lead characters.<br/><br/>The dialogues were great. Jennifer and Adam really have chemistry in this movie. I was glad to see Nicole in a comedy! The kids are hilarious! Basically, everyone did a great job!"

","This was a pleasant movie, if you find it on TV of course. But the plot is the dumbest thing ever, even for Adam Sandler. The plot is he sleeps with this girl once, then she finds his fake wedding ring and has to explain his whole fake life and takes her and his fake family to Hawaii... for a one night stand. Why would she care to know this much about him? Assume he is a scumbag and carry on, he too should just carry on ""oh no, my scheme is up well sorry"" but then there would only be about 20 minutes of a movie. I can't watch this without thinking how the plot has giant holes all over it, he never owed this girl any explanation and she had no right getting in his business and hoping his ""children"" would like her after just one night of being with him."
"Prismark10","3","5","6","28 November 2015"," Pretending all the way to Hawaii
","Just go with it is a remake of the far superior 1969 film, Cactus Flower which won Goldie Hawn a Best supporting actress Oscar.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler plays Danny a renowned plastic surgeon who improved his own looks and pretends to be in an unhappy marriage to sleep with hot women. He wears a wedding band to carry out the deception.<br/><br/>When he hooks up with an attractive younger woman Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) who does not fall for the scam as he does not wear a wedding ring. When she later sees him with a wedding band, Danny has to convince his assistant (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend to be his soon to be divorced wife and her two kids to be their own kids and they go off to holiday in Hawaii where Danny plans to propose to Palmer.<br/><br/>While in Hawaii Aniston meets up with an old college rival played by Nicole Kidman where they have petty feuds.<br/><br/>It all leads up to Danny discovering the Aniston is actually very attractive, has a sexy body and they have a romantic spark with each other.<br/><br/>The film has the usual Sandler hallmarks. He is rich, successful, women fall for him, he has goofy acquaintances. The new thing being that Sandler makes sure he can mix work and pleasure by filming in a popular holiday destination such as Hawaii in this case.<br/><br/>As always there is the normal Sandler quota of 1980s music, here there are some effective mash ups with some recent songs.<br/><br/>The film did not start off well but gets to be more fun and enjoyable as it carries on. To be fair Aniston and Sandler make it better than what it deserves to be but apart from a few minor laughs it is another long line of underwhelming rom-coms. Not funny or romantic enough.<br/><br/>As a remake it is disappointing. The 1969 film balanced Walter Matthau falling for a cute Goldie Hawn and his assistant was played by Ingrid Bergman. The balance is brought out Bergman being middle aged and also the greater age disparity between Hawn and Matthau.<br/><br/>Here it is all beautiful people from Hollywood. Aniston, Kidman, Decker all look great in a bikini. Sandler does not have that rough and ready look of Matthau and the remake has no soul."
"juneebuggy","4","5","6","10 March 2015"," Turned the brain off, got a few chuckles, nothing original here
","This had occasional humorous moments from another forgettable Adam Sandler comedy. Here he teams up with Jennifer Aniston -which was bound to happen sooner or later since she makes the same romantic comedy over and over again as well.<br/><br/>Here Sandler is a plastic surgeon who enlists the help of his loyal assistant (Aniston) to pretend to be his (soon to be) ex-wife to help him woo a much younger schoolteacher and everyone ends up in Hawaii (because Sandler has admitted that's where he likes to film movies).<br/><br/>Anyways the plots not really important, its a pretty silly movie with some terribly unfunny (stupid) dialogue. Some of the messed up plastic surgeries did give me a chuckle, but this just tried too hard and didn't succeed. Zero chemistry between Sandler and Aniston, who both portray the same characters we've seen from them in all their other movies along with a clichéd plot and just too long in general.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what Nicole Kidman was doing here but she must have had fun with her role even if her hula/coconut scene went on about 10 minutes too long. 03.13"
"troyputland","4","16","26","21 September 2015"," Just Don't Bother
","Just Go With It sits in the middle of the best and worst Adam Sandler films this side of the millennium. Many, considerable pitfalls exists. Sandler piles on the lies to get his girl. Firstly, pretending to have an ex-wife (Jennifer Aniston), because Sandler gets caught wearing his old wedding ring that scores him many girls (in his dreams). Secondly, having two children when he has none. Thirdly, his cousin Nick Swardson enters the fray, pretending to be Aniston's new German backpacker boyfriend. The lies are awful and flimsy. The charade's kept up for the entire movie. It'd be convincing if Sandler was only trying to get his leg over. Some laughs come from it, just not many memorable ones. Aniston is the prize winner here. She's the good in a jumble of mess. This film is aptly named, as if it's telling us just to go with it too."
"paul_haakonsen","6","9","13","14 April 2011"," Sandler is back...
","Finally, Adam Sandler is rising up from the perpetual spiral of semi-interesting movies he has been riding for the past years. Sure, the movie ""Just Go With It"" looks disturbingly similar to ""50 First Dates"" when you look on the cover, but they are two completely different movies altogether.<br/><br/>The story told in ""Just Go With It"" is fairly sassy and Hollywoodish; a classical lovely story of sorts. Danny (played by Adam Sandler) falls in love with Palmer (played by Brooklyn Decker). They go away to Hawaii with Danny's assistant Katherine (played by Jennifer Aniston) and his friend Eddie (played by Nick Swardson). And the story rolls as the little white lies escalate and grow larger and larger. I am not going on with more of the story here, but being a 'straight off the Hollywood romantic comedy assembly line', then there is no surprise to how the movie ends. You know it straight from the minute the movie starts. But still, the movie is quite enjoyable. Although stereotypical, then the story is a good one, and you quickly get into it.<br/><br/>There are some really good characters in the movie, aside from the four main characters. I especially liked the plastic surgery enhanced people at the party in the beginning of the movie. They were hilarious, and drew lots of laughs.<br/><br/>The location of the movie, in Hawaii, really adds a romantic aspect to the movie, and it works out really, really well. You can almost feel the sand between your toes and feel the waves as they crash gently against your shins. Thumbs up on making the feel of the movie stand out this much.<br/><br/>There is a really good chemistry between Aniston and Sandler, and they really brought the story to life and they were in their aces in this movie.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, as I had expected it to be another of Sandler's mass-produced half-funny comedies. So if you like romantic comedies and are a fan of either (or both) Sandler or/and Aniston, then ""Just Go With It"" is definitely worth checking out. The movie has some wonderful moments, it will make you laugh and it will make your heart all warm and fuzzy.<br/><br/>Thumbs up, and welcome back Sandler..."
"mmccord9126","1","70","141","14 February 2011"," Forget It
","This terrible remake of I.A.L. Diamond's work on Cactus Flower back in 1969, itself based on an excellent stage play, was difficult to sit through: Too long, too unfunny, and to formulaic. Relying on sight gags and stale jokes cannot save a bad film, much less a screenplay that probably required very little effort on the part of the writers. Of late, much of what's coming out of Hollywood reeks of paranoia. When one is afraid to take a risk, in the genre of romantic comedies, remake something that was successful years ago. This travesty is indicative such a mentality. Also, when will Jennifer A. wake up and stop getting herself involved in films that will do little for her career? Save your money and rent Cactus Flower. Trust me, you'll be happy you did."

","I put this on mainly for my girlfriend to watch and wasn't expecting very much. The opening scene explaining the wedding ring made me laugh more than a few times.

Jennifer Aniston was her usual character but I didn't dislike her and actually found myself thinking 'Hmm, I'd like to wake up next to her..' You can tell what is going to happen almost as soon as the movie starts but I found it quite watchable. Apart from Nicole Kidman. She annoyed me in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't going to be in your top 100 movies of the year and it certainly isn't going to win any awards but it is a harmless movie that will make you laugh (Unless you have no sense of humour).<br/><br/>I suggest buying it when its £3 in Asda then giving it to your sister/aunt/mum/daughter for Christmas after you've watched it. ;)"

Jennifer Anniston proves once again that she is one dimensional and the rest of the cast isn't much different.

The laughs have absolutely nothing to do with the plot and are mostly sight gags. The entire premise is absurd, instead of telling the truth to the new girl he met about wearing a wedding ring he concocts a lie so complicated and stupid it could never work under any circumstances. One point being the idea that he is automatically going to stay with this girl even though they only had one night together but still creates situations that would not work in any future with her. His fake wife is really his assistant, his cousin has to do a fake German accent and his fake daughter has to continue to do a English Cockney accent forever?<br/><br/>The blonde girlfriend must be the dumbest woman on the planet to believe the nonsense she is being told.<br/><br/>The end is predictable.<br/><br/>The only good thing was Nick Swardson who is very funny."

The sets looked plastic, the whole film looked plastic. The plot was full of inconsistencies.<br/><br/>It had the aesthetic of Nutty Professor meets Wedding Singer but nowhere near as funny.The only answer I can come up with is perhaps this doesn't translate well to British audiences?

"Horst_In_Translation","4","8","12","26 March 2016"," A weaker Sandler movie
","""Just Go with It"" is a 5-year-old comedy that got featured (like most of Sandler's works) at the Razzie Awards as well as several awards shows for younger audiences. It is the American approach to an originally Indian film. The director is Dennis Dugan and I cannot say I am too familiar with him. Same goes for all the writers working on this one. Always a bit disappointing if there are so many and the outcome is still a letdown. Sandler may not be the most talented actor, but he does a decent job in picking roles and that's why the character here fits him nicely once again. Aniston also has more pros than cons. Sadly, I cannot say the same about Brooklyn Decker, who just is not a particularly gifted actress and at times it felt she was only in her to show us her great swimsuit body. At least the Andy Roddick cameo was funny at the end. And then there is Nicole Kidman, who seems stupid and unlikeable for all her early scenes and then somehow out of nowhere gets some depth and emotion added to her character. That was embarrassing. It was so obvious that they only included her final scene because it was Nicole Kidman playing the character. Cringeworthy stuff. I would feel sorry for her because of how low she has sunk, but then I remember she has won an Oscar and is a truly mediocre actress, always has been and I don't feel sorry for her anymore.<br/><br/>As so many other times in Sandler's films, the problem is clearly the script. Yes there are a couple good moments, but the whole story about who's getting together with whom is still very much uninspired and predictable. At least Decker's character did not fall for the weird crazy guy. That would have been too much for sure. A major problem with the story is that it is based on such a ridiculous beginning. A man carries a wedding ring around with him and talks about having a dozen kids (adopted). What is going on??? And how are we supposed to believe that this is really a turn-on for women. And why would Decker be constantly interested in spending time with her boyfriend's ex-wife. There is a lot in terms of the story here that doesn't make sense unfortunately. I think there are a few decent moments in terms of comedy and this actually could have been a solid film with less of the bad. But the writers clearly weren't gifted enough to make this a rewarding watch from start to finish. The maid also adds really nothing apart from failed attempts at getting laughs. The kids were so-so I guess, but these young artist nominations are certainly a bit too much. Overall, I do not recommend this movie. Not Sandler's fault though as he is (as usual) one of the better aspects taking everything into account."

"StevePulaski","3","15","26","20 June 2011"," Full of Devlin comedy
","Just Go With It is at times dreadfully boring and extremely unfunny as it approaches the two hour mark and we are still waiting to laugh. It is one of the most selfish, laugh-free comedies I've ever seen barely saved by the beautiful scenery and likable Aniston. But even with those two minor improvements that we see what Just Go With It is really about - cheap laughs and cliché Sandler schtick.<br/><br/>This was based on a Broadway play that later became a 1969, Walter Mathau film called Cactus Flower, that later became a French play, that finally became this. I say this story has its tank run dry as this story is not only not funny but kind of sad. Sandler plays Danny, who called off his wedding day when he heard his wife talking behind his back with her friends.<br/><br/>Going to a bar with his ring on, he attracts a women and tells her a sympathy story leading to them sleeping together. Twenty five years later, he still wears the wedding ring and continues to sleep with loser bimbos to sort of never run the risk of falling in love. This works, until he meets Palmer (Decker), a beautiful women who finds the ring in his jean pocket.<br/><br/>Danny panics and tells lie after lie that he is married, but getting a divorce to his office worker Katherine (Aniston). Lie after lie leads him to fake-fathering Katherine's two bratty kids who he plans to fake kill off later. The ""family,"" Palmer, and Danny's friend all plan to go to Hawaii where more nonsense takes place.<br/><br/>Some scenes, notably the hula contest and the scenes at the kid's playground, go on for way too long and it's nothing but a poorly written joke made to be completely not funny. I guess we're supposed to root for Danny in hopes he'd get the girl, but I find no likable qualities about a womanizing loser who is not the least bit clever or funny. This is yet another movie that could be over if Danny had told Palmer he does sleeps with several women saying he is married and has a bad wife. He could then go on to tell her how she's different in a real passionate way and take her out to a bar and they can get to know each other. That might've made a way better film.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman shows up in quite possibly the worst role she's ever been offered as Devlin, Katherine's old rival. What a coincidence she is staying at the same hotel in Hawaii as Katherine at the most convenient time when she is all tied up with her ""family"" issues.<br/><br/>Also in the movie is Nick Swardson who is definitely the worst person in this movie playing a close friend of Danny's sporting one of the worst German accents I've ever heard. Every scene is he is in is too long and not at all funny in any way. Not even good for a bad laugh.<br/><br/>It comes as no surprise Just Go With It is directed by Dennis Dugan who worked on other bad comedies like The Benchwarmers, Big Daddy, and Grown Ups. It seems ever since I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, a decent comedy, Dugan has had nothing but fun placing Sandler in every character possible. Now he is working on Jack & Jill, another comedy that pairs Sandler and Al Pacino together. God help us.<br/><br/>Starring: Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston, Nick Swardson, Dan Patrick, Brooklyn Decker, Nicole Kidman, and Dave Matthews. Directed by: Dennis Dugan."

"ironhorse_iv","5","10","16","17 March 2019"," This movie is awful! I can't go with it.
","I can't believe, this 2011 comedy written by screenwriters, Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling, is a loosely based remake of the 1969 film 'Cactus Flower'. Nor could I imagine; that this was also an adaptation of an earlier successful, Broadway and French stage play of the same name. It was truly a less than stellar motion picture. Directed by Dennis Dugan, the film tells the story of Danny Maccabee (Adam Sandler) trying to fool his much younger fiancée, Palmer Dodge (Brooklyn Decker) into believing that he is divorcing a make believe pretend wife, Katherine Murphy (Jennifer Aniston), when Palmer sees his fake wedding ring, during their first date. Without spoiling this Happy Madison Production movie too much, I can see the original writer Abe Burrows spinning in his grave. Why? It's because this remake was not funny. None of the crass, juvenile toilet humor, including jokes at the expense of the overweight or physically imperfect, landed for me. It didn't help that Sandler slept through this movie. Don't get me wrong, Adam does have some talent. He did displayed some depth and emotional range before. However, Sandler in this film, look like he could care less if this flick was a success or not. He put nearly no effort in his role, going back to his usual shtick, performing as the angry man child. Because of this, Danny comes across as very annoying, tiresome and unlikeable. It doesn't help that the character is a chauvinist pig for the most part, lying to women and being a jerk to others, due to one lady making fun of him in the past. Look, I'm willing to ignore and forgive the romantic lead for lying to the love interest in order to win her heart like the original movie, but lying for years upon years to multiple ladies and painting himself as a victim of domestic abuse is downright disturbing and wrong. I have no amount of sympathy for a guy that spends two decades manipulating women to become home wreckers, in order to sleep with them. Talk about being highly misogynist. So, it was really hard for us to overlook Danny's past events and root for him, even if he has a character arc, from debauch bachelor to semi good, family man. Also, as a rich plastic surgeon, he still broke multiple Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act rules, by discussing patient information to his friends. That's not good. As for Aniston's character, the same can go with her. I hate that Katherine knew about his womanizing from the beginning, and didn't do anything to stop it for years. It made me miss so much, the original 1969 character played by actress Ingrid Bergman. I like that she had no clue of the scheme at first. It made her seem so innocent. Plus, I like how her character was somewhat dowdy. So, it was nice to see her bloom into an attractive woman in the end of that film, rather than being already generically sexy like Katherine during this movie. Despite, the lackluster and plain performance from Aniston. She still lightyears better than Brooklyn Decker's so call acting. Besides her good looks, the model turn actress's character is so lifeless, bland and dull. When you compare Palmer to the heavily flaw free spirited original character played by Golden Hawn in the first movie. It's no match. Hawn's flower child performance, wins all the time. Decker's character is just that forgettable. Although, the main cast were below average, the supporting performers were a little bit better. I kinda love Nicole Kidman as Delvin Adams. The scene with her and Katherine dancing in a contest was somewhat funny, but very hot. She was very entertaining. As for Nick Swardson, I do dig him as the over the top cartoony character of Dolph Lundgren. The surreal dialogue given to him while highly unrealistic, is so out there bizarre, that I can't help laughing, even with the scene of him drowning Palmer to keep up with the deception. I also have to give props to musician Dave Matthews. His delivery of comedic lines are top notch. Who knew that he can act! Honestly, the only supporting characters, I didn't like, were the kids. They were a little too precocious & so very annoying. No wonder, why Danny told Palmer that those fake kids of his, has been killed in a tragic accident, after throwing one of them into the mud. Nobody really liked them not even their mother Katherine. Not only that, the whole Hawaii vacation idea that the children came out with is really stretching the logistic of the plot, very thin. I find it very unlikely, that anybody in real life would spent millions of dollars of lying material, just to get a woman he barely knows to engage with him within a week. The whole plan seem unrealistic, very rushed and last, but not least, highly superficial. Honestly, there is no reason for any of this charade as Danny couldn't even marry Palmer if he wanted to. Why? It's because he didn't divorce his fake wife yet. No wedding ceremony would even allow this. Even if this could happen. The film wouldn't show it. Oddly, all the dumping was done, off screen. What a disappointing cheap cop out! While, the film didn't showcases that, it was kind enough to show us, plenty of product placement advertisement for Pizza Hut and hotels in Hawaii. Because of this, the movie felt more like a travel brochure than anything else. It's not good. Overall: Just watch the 1969 version of this film. It's so much better than its offspring, any day. That's for sure."

And why does every movie have to be about rich creeps?

Just Go With It, well, I won't mince my words is just atrociously bad - badly acted, badly directed, badly scripted. In fact I would go far as to say this was my razzie awards film of the year. I guess the clue was already in the title, possibly pleading fans for patience whilst watching it. Sorry Adam & Jennifer, this was sheer self- indulgent dribble, poor and very weak. How the hell Nicole Kidman got caught up in his script, beggars belief or any decision of good common sense. Was she forcibly made to do this? I see no other reason for her wanting this role. The script is so full of utter implausibilities, so stupidly riddled with holes, (not at all funny as Sandler can be), I felt insulted, violated, when watching this film, squandering 2 precious hours of my life which could have been occupied with much anything else - that's how meaningless of any entertainment value I think this piece of utter junk is worth."

The kids (although cute) weren't even likable and as their mother, JA showed all the warmth and maternal instincts of a Madame Tussaud figure. On the bright side for Aniston, her bikini body was way hotter than Deckers. The only bright spot was Nicole Kidman's conniving character. I can only assume that a lost wager on Kidman's part accounted for her appearance in this charade of a movie. If that's the case, she's probably sworn off betting forever.

Basically every character is so thin and so removed from reality ...<br/><br/>actually let me correct myself ... they are all very real characters to someone who personifies the negative Hollywood image. Someone who has no clue about real life, real people... someone who doesn't get that everything in these characters is flawed and therefore it will be unreasonable for them to be likable.<br/><br/>It is all about the world of 14,000 per night suites, eating out and lying every step of the way.

"jrcj41","3","19","36","5 April 2011"," Plot holes and Lazy Screen writing
","Jim Carter wrote the following review which was published in an Italian newspaper in April 2011:<br/><br/>Two weeks ago and for the first time in six years April Fool's Day fell on a Friday. Of the seven days of the week, there is something peculiar about Friday. Floating somewhere between old and new, Friday is a culmination that allows recognition of the past week's accomplishments while providing optimism in anticipation for the stretch ahead- a new beginning. It is due to this phenomenon, specifically the financial vulnerability that accompanies this sort of liberal mindset, that the American film industry, since 1981, has chosen Friday as the nearly uncontested weekday for the release of Hollywood films.<br/><br/>Thus, for the American cinema, Friday April 1st, 2011 was not a childish holiday. Instead, the date marked the Italian release of the new Adam Sandler film Just Go With It which sent Happy Gilmore fans like myself running to the box office. How ironic, therefore, that of the five April Fool's Days since 1981 that have fallen on a Friday (and perhaps also the twenty five that have not), Just Go With It has proved itself to be the greatest (or worst) joke of all.<br/><br/>From director Dennis Dugan, Just Go With It is a romantic comedy which follows the heartbroken plastic surgeon Danny Maccabee (Adam Sandler) who uses a fake wedding ring from an ""unhappy marriage"" as he searches local bars for deceitful sexual encounters. One night at a Los Angeles house party Danny's attitude suddenly changes when he meets the girl of his dreams in Palmer (Brooklyn Decker). When Palmer discovers the wedding ring, Danny sidesteps the situation claiming that he is getting a divorce. After Palmer demands to meet his wife, Danny employs his office manager Katherine Murphy (Jennifer Aniston) to pose as his future ex.<br/><br/>While he succeeds in convincing Palmer of his impending divorce, Danny is blackmailed by Katherine's real son (posing as his own), and is forced to take his fake family, along with Palmer, to Hawaii for an impromptu vacation. Danny and Katherine become a sort of improvisational comedy troop, struggling to keep up with the lies they have created as they grow closer and closer. Eventually, Danny and Katherine slowly lose sight of Palmer, as they fall, instead, for one another.<br/><br/>In summarizing the plot of Just Go With It, the mere amount of detail, even main characters, one is able to eliminate without altering the story is a testimony to the poor quality of screen writing exhibited by Allan Loeb. Lacking any clear form of the three act structure, the characters indulge in irrelevant excursions such as a dance competition between Katherine and her college adversary, an unexplained repeated mentioning of the boy band NSYNC, and a strange dinner date that is interrupted in order to save a dying sheep.<br/><br/>The written dialogue is generally boring, containing monologues in which the characters simply tell the audience who they are (notably Palmer's self introduction the first night at the beach). Danny's first encounter with Palmer is nothing more that visual attraction and lacks any effort in creating a believable chemistry. The story is generally illogical and lacks reason, as the characters treat important institutions, such as marriage, with impulsiveness; planning and cancelling weddings as if they were dentist appointments.<br/><br/>One may argue that a film such as Just Go With It is not intended to be a logical and original treatment of believable relationships, and therefore should not be criticized within these boundaries. Being a romantic comedy, however, the film does at least carry with it the expectation of being comic- an expectation unfulfilled."

Overall, I am hard pressed to blame Hollywood and the screen play writers for producing this farce of a plot, as the people inexplicably yearn for such cringe worthy clichés and egregious character development, and back stories. The much lauded and acclaimed acting performances of Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston culminate in this 'piece de resistance', unlikely to be bettered this millennia.

Danny becomes a womanizer and uses his wedding ring to lie to women and get laid.<br/><br/>Twenty-three years later, Dr. Maccabee is a well succeeded plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills that still uses his wedding ring to get women to bed. When he meets the younger mathematic teacher Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) in a party, they have one night stand on the beach and Danny has a crush on her. But Palmer finds his wedding ring on his pocket and he lies to her, telling that he is divorcing from his wife. Palmer asks to meet his wife, and Danny asks to his long-time assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) to pose as his wife. Katherine accepts, but things get more complicated when Katherine, who is a single mother, receives a phone call from her daughter and Palmer learns that they have two children and asks to meets them. Now Danny bribes the two children to travel to Hawaii to spend a couple of days together knowing each other.<br/><br/>When they are at the airport, Danny's friend Eddie (Nick Swardson) unexpectedly joins them telling that he is Katherine's boyfriend expecting to travel to Hawaii with the expenses paid by Danny. The group arrives in a fancy hotel where Katherine meets her university foe Devlin Adams (Nicole Kidman) that is lodged at the same hotel.<br/><br/>The overrated ""Just Go with It"" is a disappointing and unfunny comedy with Jennifer Aniston, Adam Sandler and Nicole Kidman. The absurd and unethical story if awful and even Adam Sandler seems to be irritated with a poor performance. His unconvincing character is a liar and womanizer, capable to bribe children to keep his lies and to marry a woman that he has seduced using successive lies without any moral value or ethics. His assistant Katherine not only accepts to participate in the scheming to lure his girlfriend, but also allows her children to be bribed and accepts the invitation of her enemy to have dinner together. Palmer is a moron capable to believe on the most unrealistic stories. His best friend is a complete dummy and disloyal, capable to take advantage of a situation to travel with his expenses on Danny.<br/><br/>There are the usual exaggerations of the contemporary Hollywood productions, with Danny expending lots of money in fancy and fashionable boutiques and in the suites of the hotel.

For example, take a romantic story, add a few comedy elements without adding any big tragic event and you get yourself a romantic comedy.<br/><br/>On the other hand, and this is still just my opinion, when you add some romantic elements in a comedy (if you didn't know, romances are a part of our day-to-day life), it doesn't automatically makes the movie a romantic comedy. In a similar way, by adding other elements we would have a horror comedy, a thriller comedy, etc. This movie keeps it simple. Yes, it does have some romantic elements, but it doesn't rely on them to be funny. JA (although not my favorite actress) was very good and has proved, once more, she has a good eye for movie parts.

"DICK STEEL","8","15","29","11 February 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Just Go With It
","Director Dennis Dugan was responsible for a number of comedies with funnyman Adam Sandler, from Happy Gilmore to Big Daddy in the 90s, to the more recent fare of I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, You Don't Mess with the Zohan, and Grown Ups. I'm a big fan of some of these if I may say low brow offerings, but hey, don't berate me for having a good time. As with most of the comedies Sandler has starred in thus far, most straddle between two broad areas of being funny, and yet having some major drama and/or romantic fare to bulk up the running time, making the films seem more like two halves put together.<br/><br/>And Just Go With It is no different. Based on a French stage play and an earlier film called Cactus Flower in the 60s (hence making this a modern day remake of sorts), this movie has both all out, riotous scenes designed to make you laugh, yet having depth following a tried and tested formula for a romance, which gets catalyzed by a little white lie that grows out of control, needing as one character puts it, an index card to keep track of the sprawling tales they have to tell and keep at in order to not puncture their respective ruses.<br/><br/>So the comedy here involves lies and truths, with Adam Sandler's renowned plastic surgeon Danny finding out the power of sympathy and the sex that comes with it with his wearing of a wedding ring, only that he hasn't got married just yet, playing on how some swingers just love to get it going with married men. Just when he's serious about Palmer (Brooklyn Decker), a really young girl for his age, she finds that wedding band, and he cooks up the story that he's actually getting a divorce. Palmer needing proof meant Danny's persuasion (with benefits in kind) of his assistant / reception Katherine (Jennifer Aniston), a divorcée with two kids, to pose as his soon to be ex-wife, and then roping in her children Maggie (Bailee Madison) and Michael (Griffin Gluck) to pose as his as well.<br/><br/>And it goes two ways, since Katherine has a thing about her rival from school for many years (I shall not name this A-list actress so as not to spoil the surprise on her comedic performance, so don't go up looking IMDb.com, OK?), and uses her pretense with Danny to try and keep up with the Joneses. Needless to say their scheme of being husband and wife means to keep up with the multitude of lies for each different scenario, either Danny's or Katherine's, which naturally lead to some fun scenarios. But the funniest of course belongs to that between Sandler, Madison and Gluck, one who decides to ham it up with a British accent, while the other is just plain sombre, and their tip top act as the father-children draws countless of laughter since Danny often finds himself being blackmailed by the kids, who are doing a perfect job. The photo taking scene on the golf course is priceless, and possibly one of the funniest in the film.<br/><br/>Then comes the dramatic, romantic half, where you can see it coming from a mile away when both Sandler and Aniston's Danny and Katherine come on screen, with their banter, the premise, the setup and such all spelling f-o-r-m-u-l-a, and you'll just about know what happens between them. The romance between Danny and Palmer then looked like a shade of Ben Stiller's The Heartbreak Kid in a way, and like many other romantic comedies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Hawaii serves as the perfect backdrop for friendships and relationships to unravel, and also to provide the Hilton hotel another major product placement opportunity after Up in the Air.<br/><br/>A film like this will never steer clear of toilet humour, and they are here by the truckloads. Yes it's lowbrow sometimes, but a great way to de-stress after a hard day's work, since you know exactly what you're in for, and the film delivers just that."

However, she finds the ring and wants nothing to do with him, until he convinces her that he is getting divorced.<br/><br/>That is when Danny's assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) comes in to the picture. This is one of the roles that Aniston is meant to play and she does great as the ""future ex-wife"", who is playing the part that Danny wants her to play.<br/><br/>As Danny continues to make up lie after lie, the story continues to be funny and interesting as it makes the audience wonder, ""How is Danny going to get out of this mess?""<br/><br/>What I found funny in the story is that Danny is not the only one in the movie who is telling lies. At a hotel in Hawaii, Katherine runs into an old sorority sister named Devlin (played by the wonderful Nicole Kidman). Kidman does not have a whole lot of screen time, but she takes great advantage of her time as she great as this smug woman, who Katherine hates and is friends with at the same time. Devlin also tells lies to Katherine about what has gone on in her life.<br/><br/>I think what makes this movie fun is the crazy situations that the characters get themselves into as they keep making up lies and playing along. The movies has what you would expect from watching any Adam Sandler movie: Sandler being a goofball, Sandler having a love interest, crazy laugh out loud jokes, and hilarious situations. But what makes this one work is how well put together it is. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the performances by Sandler, Aniston, and Kidman. Dugan shows that he is good at what he does best: making Adam Sandler movies."

","Danny (Adam Sandler) is a plastic surgeon who's found that a fake wedding ring is his greatest weapon in picking up girls. Despite its success, he has caught the attention of Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) without it, and when she sees it she doesn't react like the other women. Lying, Danny tells her he's going through a divorce and to cover that end of the fib he coerces his assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) into playing the part of his wife. The snowball effect gets into full swing and before long Danny finds himself vacationing in Hawaii with Palmer as well as his fake family complete with two kids. His biggest trouble may be in deciding if the charade he's keeping is actually the one he wants.<br/><br/>Just Go with It is a return to the typical Sandler vehicle, which it turns out is tragically dated and littered with blows to the crotch. The changup comes in Aniston being a more established foil than he's used to being paired, so some of her recent work shows through. You'd think that the combination of two over-exposed styles would clash, but they complement what the other is missing. Truth be told, having a sassy Aniston to knock Sandler down a peg works remarkably well. What isn't a good call is having to aim for the gross-out joke in the middle of some good dialog. So as you can image their job is going to put them in situations with body parts that aren't going to be shown in this PG-13 comedy. As likable as the Sandler-Aniston duo comes across, it's unfortunate that Just Go with It lives and dies by the supporting cast. On one hand Nicole Kidman and Dave Matthews hit a remarkable amount of laughs, and the former has a very large part in a film that doesn't show her for even a second in the promos. That's what I call a ""pleasant surprise"" and I wish other movies took note. The other end of the spectrum is visited with a combination of horrible child acting (possibly directing but more on this soon) and Nick Swardson. With the kids you get the sense that these children are suffering from the direction of Dennis Dugan who always makes the youth overly expressive. This time it troubles me more because the children have quite a bit of lines to grin through. With Maggie, a character supposedly taking up acting, she's never genuine. Michael similarly draws inspiration from performances for his role as Danny's son but instead is like a possessed cadaver. Finally Swardson is clearly aiming to be the most obnoxious actor ever. Not to get into too much detail over it, but there's nothing funny about it.<br/><br/>The outcome of the narrative is astoundingly conventional. This isn't a story that's going to challenge even a Facebook drone. Maybe I'm over analyzing, but the distasteful level of some of the scenes is so strong that I wonder if the intention is to test the tolerance of audience. Once you've sat through enough of it, you really do just go with it.<br/><br/>To say that Just Go with it was better than I expected is merely a comparative phrase. Did I expect it to suck? Yes. Indeed there is a great deal about it that puzzles me as to how Sony Pictures could have decided to release this to the public, but in some ways the cacophony of gags is effective because one is bound to hit you hard. I had belly laughs and that's not easy to coax from me."

","Now I know that after reading this review some so called 'critics' will call me a retard, but I liked 'Just go with it'. It does not have the most original story or the best of acting but it does one thing well and that is to make you laugh. It isn't the most sophisticated humor but you don't expect that from an Adam Sandler movie. This movie is right up there with '50 first dates'. Jennifer Aniston is looking amazing and though the chemistry between Adam and her isn't quite so crackling, she stole quite a few scenes especially the one where she is doing the hula dance and the one where she walks in for the first time after her makeover. This movie is definitely a must see at least once.. I say ""Just go with it.."""

","Danny (Adam Sandler)'s reaction to youthful rejection because of his big nose is a) rhinoplasty, b) a career in plastic surgery, and c) chronic promiscuity based on projecting a false impression of being abused by his (non-existent) wife. Then he meets hot teacher Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) and is ready to enter commitment: the only thing is that she wants to meet his wife. So Danny press gang's his practice assistant single mother Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) into pretending to be his wife, and then things start to get complicated.<br/><br/>I was ready to dislike this film - I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan, and Jennifer Aniston annoys me because she tends to take the easy road by playing essentially the same character in every movie. And there is an elephant in the room in this particular movie in that does Danny really expect to go through the rest of his life with a fictional ex-family? And yet I enjoyed it much more than I expected to. I saw it with a moderately sized audience including some youngsters (it is a certificate 12 in the UK - children can watch if accompanied by adults), and there was a great deal of laughter from all ages. There is no bad language and relatively little by way of sexual innuendo. Despite the fundamental improbability, the plot steamrollers on well enough, and with a number of mildly unexpected changes of direction (Nicole Kidman's arrival, to name but one). The humour is varied, with many of Sandler's one liners being amusing, and some effective slapstick. Bailee Madison (as Aniston's daughter) delivers a worse English accent than Dick van Dyke's infamous cockerney in Mary Poppins, and to better effect. All the characters are inherently likable - not always the case in Sandler's movies - and the denouement is satisfactory, if predictable.<br/><br/>Oh, and I have no complaint whatsoever about the wardrobe dept's choice of bikinis for the Ms's Kidman, Aniston and Becker."

","Adam Sandler movies are hit or miss; they're either pretty damn funny or they're not very funny at all (saving for his attempts to do some serious stuff here and there). This one kind of fell flat. Sandler is a doc who gets cruelly dumped on his wedding day by his superficial bride to be and decides the only way to heal his broken heart is to become a superficial jackass himself, by bedding women who are much too young and pretty to ever really give a guy like that a second look, much less time in the sack. You're supposed to sympathize with him because he WAS treated unfairly by the gal he was about to marry but you just can't. He's too snarky and self serving so it's hard to actually root for him. He hatches a plan to use his assistant, played by Jennifer Aniston, to bag a young supermodel chick (Brooklyn Decker) who's so far out of his league it's laughable. Unfortunately, Aniston is back on screen again portraying the exact same ""hey, look at me! I'm a cool, laid back chick with a breezy attitude towards life so you should just love me"" Rachel-type character that she's played in just about every movie she's ever been in (with the exception of the wonderfully acted ""The Good Girl""). Nick Swardson is along for the ride as Sandler's dippy friend who provides a few laughs along the way but little else and the young actors who portray Aniston's kids are kind of grating after a short while. Nicole Kidman has a small role as Aniston's nemesis from previous years gone by, but her character is so two-dimensional and silly that it's obvious she's brought in only to be used as a filler in a dumb back story involving Aniston's long suffering character Katherine's past. The highlight of this story is the stunning Hawaiian scenery but that's all. This isn't the worst film I've ever seen but it's certainly one of the worst Adam Sandler movies I've had to sit through. He can be absolutely hilarious (Anger Management, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, etc.) but this one kind of bites."

","I watched this with my girlfriend, and I wasn't expecting much. This film genre, though I usually enjoy the comedy side, tends to be rather heavily focused on the romance.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler's character was well played, and very funny, going to extraordinary lengths to cover up a lie he'd made to the gorgeous Brooklyn Decker (who would have made the film worth watching even if the story was rubbish). Jennifer Aniston's character was also nicely portrayed.<br/><br/>I thought the soundtrack was a bit off in places - the music could have done with being a bit older, but generally the film was put together incredibly well.<br/><br/>For me, though, as a guy who tends to prefer action flicks, it was the comedy that made this film good. Sandler and Aniston were on good form, but it was the involvement of the kids that made this film so funny. Oh, and the scene with the fake German accent and the sheep. (If that isn't intriguing enough to make you watch this film then just go to watch both Aniston and Decker in bikinis)."
"zardoz-13","8","7","12","14 February 2011"," Just Grin At It!
","Adam Sandler is really getting mellow in his forties. ""Happy Gilmore"" director Dennis Dugan's ""Just Go With It"" qualifies as an uneven, predictable, but entertaining farce for the former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian. Sandler looks like he had a blast as a smart aleck Jewish plastic surgeon who masquerades as a hen-pecked husband so he can bed down with beautiful babes. No Sandler comedy would be complete without his distinctive brand of infantile humor. ""Just Go With It"" boasts its share of absurdly ludicrous moments. The best example depicts Sandler's co-star Nick Swardson of ""Reno 911!"" as he performs the Heimlich maneuver on an obviously artificial sheep that has swallowed a rubber toy. Surprisingly enough, this lightweight, PG-13 rated, romantic comedy spends most of its 117 minutes being cute and endearing rather than toxic and offensive. Mind you, Sandler and company ridicule the generation gap, gays, marriage, plastic surgery, bowel movements, erectile dysfunction, and mendacity. What ultimately sets ""Just Go With It"" apart from the usual Sandler shenanigans is the presence of upscale co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman. Kidman has never been such a clown. Together they prove that a woman doesn't have to be a twenty-something nymph, like drop-dead gorgeous swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker, to bound around in a bikini. Although Dugan and scenarists Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling have essentially remade the 1969 Walter Matthau comedy ""Cactus Flower,"" ""Just Go With It"" resembles the classic Blake Edwards comedy ""10"" with Dudley Moore and Bo Derek. In ""10"" (1979), a middle-aged man pursued a twenty year old babe before he realized that their age gap made them incompatible. Dugan lenses the graceful Decker in slow-motion as she jogs through the surf. These moments are comparable to painter Sandro Botticelli's picture of Venus on a Half-Shell. <br/><br/>""Just Go With It"" opens with a 1980's prologue. Cardiologist Dr. Danny Maccabee (Adam Sandler of ""The Water Boy"") is about to get married. Danny has a hilariously large nose that rivals the prominent proboscis of Cyrano de Bergerac. While Danny is biding his time for marriage, he learns that his fiancée not only has been cheating on him throughout their courtship but she also plans to cheat on him after they exchange nuptials. Worse, she isn't marrying Danny for love but for his money. Our heartbroken hero ditches her and becomes a successful plastic surgeon. In the original, the lead in ""Cactus Flower"" was a dentist. Initially, Danny goes to a meat market bar to drown his grief in alcohol. He helps a lady who is being harassed by the local lotharios. At first, she believes Danny he is just another wolf until she spots his wedding ring. Sadly, he reveals his plight. He lies that he is the victim of an unhappy marriage. The lady takes pity on him and takes him home for a one-night stand. Danny relies on this cynical strategy to keep himself knee deep in commitment-free dames. <br/><br/>Eventually, a lady comes along who changes Danny's mind. A gorgeous sixth-grade math teacher, Palmer (Brooklyn Decker in her film debut), proves to be more of a distraction than a hormonally addled teenage boy can handle. The kid cuts up his knee when he looks at Palmer rather than his destination. Danny doctors him up and gets together with Palmer. They spend the night on the beach. The next morning Palmer finds a wedding ring in Danny's pants and refuses to have anything to do with him. She doesn't date married men. Danny pursues Palmer but gets nowhere. He tries to explain that he isn't married. Since he has no way of convincing her that he is a bachelor, our desperate hero decides to lie. Danny tells Palmer that he is getting a divorce. This tactic changes everything for the better, and Palmer is prepared to resume their romance. However, she makes one condition. Danny must introduce her to his soon-to-be ex-wife. Danny throws himself on the mercy his comely office manager Katherine Murphy (Jennifer Aniston of ""The Bounty Hunter"") and persuades her to act as his ex-wife. As it turns out, Katherine is a divorced single parent with two kids, Maggie (Bailee Madison) and Michael (Griffin Gluck), and is literally Danny's closest friend. <br/><br/>Everything goes smoothly when Palmer meets Katherine. As Katherine is about to depart, she receives a cell phone call about her children Maggie and Michael. Palmer changes her rules. She demands that Danny introduce her to Maggie and Michael. Danny has to bribe Katherine's kids to pretend that they are his offspring. Maggie aspires to be an actress and sells out for acting lessons, while Michael holds out for a Hawaiian vacation so he can swim with dolphins. Danny takes them to Hawaii along with his cousin, Eddie (wacky Nick Swardson), who masquerades as an Austrian sheep salesman. While in Hawaii, Katherine runs into her old friend Devlin (Nicole Kidman of ""Eyes Wide Shut"") and Danny and Katherine have to act like they are really married. The complications that occur threaten to drive Palmer and Danny apart, but the surprise ending isn't really surprising.<br/><br/>The humor is low-brow but funny. The goofy plastic surgery sight gags generate lots of laughs. The lady with the arched eyebrow is a hoot! The remainder of ""Just Go With It"" turns into an evasive, door-slamming farce with Danny doing his best to fool Palmer. The rivalry between Aniston and Kidman to see who is a better dancer, particularly in the scene where their significant others must dance body against body to move a coconut from their hips to their lips without their hands is amusing. Along the way, our hero learns a few lessons about love and commitment that neither we nor he would typically see in an Adam Sandler comedy. You will grin more than you will grimace at ""Just Go With It."""

","Just Go With It is a horrible movie. I laughed occasionally but for the most part this is just your generic romantic comedy.<br/><br/>The acting was bad, really bad. Adam Sandler is the funniest but even he isn't always that funny. His girlfriend's character (I forget the actresses name) was not funny, bland, and an idiot. She literally has no character outside of the ""hot blond"" character. Jennifer Aniston doesn't have much of a character either. She is just sort of there, doesn't really have much of an impact on the story until the end.<br/><br/>And finally there are the child actors, and these are the worst. Not only are these kids not funny and annoying, but they were generally a bunch of whiny a******s. The little girl was by far the worst, with her annoying voice and her attempts at an accent, god I loathed this character and her performance. The little boy is an idiot and is totally useless, not much to say there.<br/><br/>In terms of plot you could already guess where this is going literally by looking at either the trailer or the poster. So you have this guy (Adam Sandler) who is used to having a series of one-night stands until he meets whats-er-name, and finally decides he wants to settle down. So he has to fake a marriage with his co-worker (Jennifer Aniston) and get a fake divorce so he can marry the hot blond. This plot is paper thin and pulls no punches. You already know how this is going to end. The hot blond with no character is supposed to marry Sandler's character but he instead falls in love with Aniston and they end up getting married.<br/><br/>Just Go With It is a horrible movie. Unless you like jokes with someone getting hit in the crotch (which happens about 2 times, I counted) or slow motion shots of a woman coming out of the water in a bikini (which happens twice as well) then you may like this movie. But if you want a good funny romantic comedy this is NOT for you."

","JUST GO WITH IT<br/><br/>I have seen this before and I do like it. It is not Adam's best film, but it is still funny and entertaining.<br/><br/>The movie is about a plastic surgeon who pretends to be married just to get girls. All goes well until he falls for a girl that he meets at a party, but then she finds the wedding ring in his pocket. He then tries to convince her that he is getting divorced, but when she wants to meet his soon to be ex wife he panics. So he persuades his receptionist to pretend to be his wife and then the comedy begins.<br/><br/>It is a typical romantic comedy there is comedy right up until the end of the movie where it is all romance. The comedy is very good, but it has the typical Adam Sander feel to it, which is not a bad thing. Adam as always gives 100%. He is a great comedy actor, but unfortunately his recent movies are just nowhere near as good as his earlier ones. Grown Ups and Jack and Jill was average at best. In fact I was very disappointed with Jack and Jill, I just thought that was terrible.<br/><br/>This movie also stars Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer is a typical romantic comedy actress. I am still waiting to see her actually challenge herself and take on a serious role. I think she might be OK with it, but until she gets out of the comedy rut, she will never be an Oscar winner. But putting that behind, I don't actually mind her. She is good at comedies, and she can be very funny at times. She does a good job in this, but it is not her best performance. Another great character was Eddie played by Nick Swardson. He was pretending most of the way through the film to be from Sweden (I think), but his fake accent and his character was hilarious. Especially when he tries to give CPR to a sheep. I was laughing so much. You have to see it.<br/><br/>It was very good to see Nicole Kidman in this too. She has a very small role but she plays the character very well.<br/><br/>The children in this movie were not too annoying either. I find children actors very irritating most of the time, but they were not too in your face. The girl, played by Bailee Madison, was slightly annoying, but that was because she was putting on a fake English accent throughout the whole movie. It started out funny, but after a while it lost its comedy value and I stopped laughing, I just wished she would stop talking. Too much of a good thing is never good. But generally not bad little actors. The boy was played by Griffin Gluck. He was quite good too. I believed he was a sad little kid who had Daddy issues.<br/><br/>The story is not bad, the acting is not great but works very well with the comedy & the romance is not too over the top which is always good. I always find that with romantic comedies the romance kills the mood sometimes of the comedy because it is drawn out too long, but this movie is not too bad for that. There is a lot of fun to be had with a plastic surgeon in a comedy, and Adam knows how to make it funny. He goes to extremes to be funny with his ideas. He also seems a likable person which always helps to find him funny.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>""Mommy! That man put his pee-pee on my face!""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>Ordinary person movie reviews"

Plus Adam and Jennifer have a knack for sounding like they're actually having a real conversation instead of being two actors reciting their parts of the script dramatically.

Adam Sandler was especially good and even though I've never liked Jennifer Aniston, she did a fine job here. However the guy who stole the show for me was Nick Swardson. What an idiotic role that guy had, but he certainly delivered and had me laughing like a sick maniac. I must say the kids were also very good.

After movies like ""Bedtime Stories"" and ""Click"" it seemed like Sandler was starting to move away from what makes him funny. ""Grown-ups"" was good, but that seemed more like friends having fun then a movie. This movie is closer to the humor in ""Big Daddy"" then any other movie he has done recently. While still a pretty soft PG13 Sandler, this movie is actually very, very funny. Nowhere near the days of ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Billy Madison"", Sandler is slowly trying to capture his younger days, and with this and ""Grown-ups"" he is getting close. The chemistry between Sandler and Aniston is perfect and I would not be surprised to see them in more movies together. Very, very entertaining and funny.

","Adding to Jennifer Aniston's growing portfolio of Rom-Coms comes Just Go With It, but despite a huge budget, this embarrassing flop ends up going nowhere.<br/><br/>The premise is a good one: a plastic surgeon (Adam Sandler) is in romantic pursuit of a much younger girlfriend (Brooklyn Decker), and trying to smooth over a lie that keeps on building with the help of his assistant at the clinic (Jennifer Aniston). Yet despite the star cast and exotic locations, the actors' delivery is a confused mishmash of slapstick comedy and nerdish quick-fire dialogue.<br/><br/>There are some funny moments, particularly in the first part of the film, but it soon lodges itself firmly in 'uncomfortable viewing' territory. The dialogue – particularly between Aniston and Sandler - is at times rambling and littered with awkward silences. Adding to this bewildering experience are some technical curiosities: the film editing leaves a lot to be desired - woeful cutting and continuity blunders that would leave first year film students aghast. The external sound frequently suffers from ambient distractions, whilst indoor scenes are often clattery or muffled - not of a standard you'd expect of a Hollywood movie. The lighting, too, is brash and littered with inconsistencies - unflattering on the actors.<br/><br/>Aniston outclasses the entire cast in terms of looks, presence and delivery - surely uncomfortable appearing in a production of a standard well beneath her abilities. At 117 minutes, it's a marathon of the worst cinematic kind, becoming more cringe-worthy as it labours to a conclusion.<br/><br/>A shakedown of the script and technical issues could have made this an acceptable comedy, but its fate is sealed early on. Like so many Rom- Coms, it plunges into a quagmire of misfiring gags and flawed plot lines from which it never emerges."
"levitak","4","13","28","16 April 2011"," The movie was disappointing
","Frankly it's not a surprise that Brooklyn Decker was so heavily promoted in the marketing of this movie. She is one of the few bright moments. Not just because of the eye candy factor. There is no doubt that she is a stunningly hot woman but in this movie she is also a really nice and sweet character and frankly the scenes with her were one of the few things that made the movie more tolerable. Yes even when she had clothes on which is impressive <br/><br/>As for the rest the best word to describe it is cliché. Adam Sandler plays the same good guy who lost his way , does the same jokes to deal with bla blah reaches realization due to unforeseen consequences. Basically every Adam Sandler movie ever<br/><br/>The children are incredibly annoying . I think they were aiming for children with adorable quirks that are supposed to be annoying but are actually endearing but to me they were just annoying As for Jennifer Aniston...I honestly don't know what's wrong with this woman. I can understand Adam Sandler repeating his formula. Those are his movies and for better of worse(for worse) they are a proved cash cow and he is a businessman after all. But Aniston? The woman is rich as hell and has enough influence to get a variety of roles and she plays the same character for close to twenty years now. And yes she plays it in this movie as well. And yes it's as boring and unoriginal as you think <br/><br/>So in conclusion if you are a hardcore Sandler and Aniston fan you might like the movie. If you haven't watched too many Sandler Aniston movies you might still like it. But if you already sick of seeing the same movie over and over but with a different name and the same characters over and over I suggest you avoid it. Or at least don't pay money for it.

","I might be a bit biased about this because I have a personal sympathy for Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler but I found this movie entertaining, simple and relaxing. These are all characteristics that most romcoms these days lack in. They all try too much to be either funny, either too romantic, either too complex and suffer from the storytelling point of view but this film, while it's a typical romcom it still delivers more than expected. But let's go into slicing this bread entirely and as objectively as I can.<br/><br/>Danny (Adam Sandler) is a successful plastic surgeon which after a disappointing start within his first marriage, he starts using his ex-wedding ring to get regular chicks in his bed. His methods work till he meets this gorgeous young blond named Palmer (Brooklyn Decker). In order to convince her he has real interest in their future he needs to play the ex-husband/present-dad card by asking his personal assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend to be his ex-wife. Things go really crazy and messed up when kids are involved and the ""little"" trip to Hawaii is the cherry on top of the cake. It turns out clicheic and Danny falls for Katherine but I never lost my patience. I really enjoyed the delivery. The dialogue wasn't bad, the acting was pretty much what this movie needed, a pleasant appearance from the lovely Nicole Kidman, it has funny moments and not funny in a retarded way, no nonsense and no stupid development of both characters and story and last but not least, it has a solid ""feel-good"" atmosphere. This film is getting too much heat in my opinion and so many feel they need to bash this because ""oh, another clicheic romcom""... Well, I was entertained and I think this was the purpose of the makers. Great time at the cinema and definitely not a waste of money or time.<br/><br/>The production design, the technical execution was more than OK. It kind of reminded me of Forgetting Sarah Marshall as far as captions, contrast and chosen music. This is one of the best movies made by Aniston in the last years, probably since ""Marley & Me"" which a really good weekend movie. Adam Sandler is back in doing more of his good stuff and God, could I ask one thing? How does these women look so damn well at their age?...<br/><br/>Overall, the film's title pretty much suggest what the audience should do with the movie: ""Just Go with It"". It's a good formula of comedy and romance, enjoyable with decent amount of salt and pepper that will leave you smile at the end of the show."

","Speaking as an Adam Sandler movie buff, I thought this was his best movie since Happy Gilmore.<br/><br/>The movie was somewhat predictable, but extremely funny. The two breakout stars were the kids of Jennifer Aniston's character.<br/><br/>The plot is basically a womanizing plastic surgeon who meets a gorgeous, young woman. She sees his wedding ring, and the lie eventually grows a lot bigger.<br/><br/>I have no clue why this Sandler movie got such bad reviews. It's like they don't even watch his movies anymore, and just review it like all the ones they disliked in the past. <br/><br/>I understand some of his movies in the past were really stupid, like: Zohan and Chuck and Larry.<br/><br/>When you go see an Adam Sandler movie, you're not expecting to see some cutting edge plot with a giant twist at the end. You're expecting to sit through a really funny movie with your family.<br/><br/>The only people who don't like this movie are the ones that have no sense of humor."

","Adam Sandler's/Dennis Dugan's films has been using the same formula since ""Happy Gilmore"" (Heck even if you watch ""Problem child"" you can clearly see Dennis Dugan made it) Same type of humor, a lot of the same actors..You would think that by now everyone would now beforehand what to expect from their films.That is why I am always surprise that you get people moaning about Sandler's/Dungan's films..Why are they going to them , they should know the type of films it's gonna be because their films are always the same type?!! I personally like watching those films, they are brainless , harmless fun and most importantly they are the type of comedy you can bring kids along(It's getting very rare,most comedy does allusion about sex and drugs these days).I am never surprise by those films, I go expecting something that I always end up getting,I knew exactly what sort of film ""Just go with it"" was from who made it and I was not disappointed the least. It was a sweet little comedy. Jennifer Aniston actually had good chemistry with Sandler and I was surprised by how great they work together as they are two actors I would have not imagine together as ""lover"". Nicole Kidman was wonderful as the bitchy school friend of Aniston's character and I might add that she was the best looking I have seen her on film in a long time. The two kids were very natural and likable , I was afraid at first when I knew the kids were going to be featured in the film heavily but those two were great actors for their young age. Beside all of this like I mentioned before this is a Happy Gilmore film and people should be aware of what comes with it.It's light hearted fluff and I personally liked it. So to all the haters if you watched Grown ups last year and didn't like it, why did you go into that one? If you didn't like ""Just go with it"" I think you should stay away from any upcoming films by Sandler and Dugan because chances are you'll be back on those board complaining about them as well.."

","I found this film infectiously funny and entertaining. Adam Sandler can be a bit hit & miss for me but here he is perfect, as is the lovely Jennifer Aniston, starting out as his homely lab assistant and then turning out all glammed up and as beautiful as we all know that she can be.<br/><br/>Most enticing though, is model Brooklyn Decker, who is ravishing in every scene that she is in and soon is Danny McCabee's (Sandler) younger than he girlfriend. Danny is a successful L.A. plastic surgeon but still resorts to shady tactics to bed his dates. This tactic backfires with Palmer (Decker) and so a plan involving Katherine (Aniston) to pose as his soon-to-be divorced wife is hatched. Plus her real, currently fatherless two children (who are great!). The girl pretends to speak a mixture of Cockney and ""Royal"" English which is very funny and the boy wants to swim with dolphins - but cannot swim.<br/><br/>The inclusion on the holiday of Nicole Kidman almost took things too far but they all bounced off each other well and there are some great scenes with just the three leads. Yes, it is contrived nonsense most of the time, including a ridiculous German-accented pretend husband (who sells sheep online for a living) for Katherine and a holiday to Hawaii. But this mixture of exotic locations, fun, slight sauciness and good-fun banter (plus some swim-suited glamour) make for a heady mix of great entertainment. I almost want to see it again....."
"bob-rutzel-1","7","5","9","12 June 2011"," Actually Funny. Well Done
","Plastic Surgeon Danny (Sandler) picks up women by wearing a wedding band. Then, he meets someone he really likes, Palmer (Decker), and she won't have anything to do with a married man. He tells her he is getting a divorce and she buys it. Katherine (Aniston) agrees to be the fake divorcing wife and her kids also play along and the lies keep getting bigger and bigger. There was no end to them.<br/><br/>I kept saying that most Hollywood comedies have their funny stuff up front in the beginning and then later anything comical is forgotten for the rest of the movie. Well, I have to qualify that statement. Oh, it's still true, but not for an Adam Sandler movie. He has a way to keep the yuks coming throughout. There is nothing overdone, silly, stupid (ok, well there were a couple silly things, but like I said in a Hollywood comedy silly and stupid are mandatory) or telegraphed where they become tedious and not funny in most other comedies. But this doesn't happen in a Adam Sandler movie. Many of his contemporaries should take note, especially the ones I keep saying should be selling used cars. And, Sandler even hires some of them for his movies and still they don't learn anything? Bummer.<br/><br/>Sometimes a good comedy is based upon a lie, that keeps evolving and funny things can come out of subsequent misunderstandings, and half-truths. That is an old and true comedic formula and Sandler knows it, and he has enough sense to keep the funny things going on all the way through. <br/><br/>I had to laugh out loud many times. Just had to do it. Take for example one of the kids who agrees to go along with the lie. She wants to project an English accent. So Danny says he wants to hear it first. So she goes, ""Heeeeeeellllo"" in a very exaggerated rather high English tone. Immediately, Danny says, ""No."" I was almost on the floor. Pure gold. <br/><br/>I am quite leery of Hollywood comedies, but what kept me was the scene in the doctor's office when a woman came in who had an accident with one of her implants (it deflated). The conversation between Danny and his assistant Catherine sealed the deal for me and it was quite good. Yes, a little on the risqué side, but funny nevertheless. Hey, risqué can be funny if it's done right and this was. Hey, I just went with it. HA!<br/><br/>The entire support cast performed well and Brooklyn Decker may become a very good actress. She held her own. You may have seen her in the recent SI Swimsuit issue. <br/><br/>This was actually funny and better than the usual-not-funny Hollywood comedies. Well done. <br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Sex Talk: Yes, mostly in the beginning Language: No f-bombs. A couple S-words were heard."

","I wish that I could live in movies. Everything would be so much easier. Sure I would have problems, but they would all be solved in two hours our less. I would find a beautiful woman and of course there would be some discourse then I would try to deceive her through a series of lies. She would catch me in these lies and we would either a) make up and get back together or b) I find my true love, who was my ""Plain Jane"" friend all along. Regardless we would live happily ever after... until the sequel where we have kids and something zany would bound to happen. <br/><br/>""Just Go with It"" is the newest comedy starring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. Sandler plays Danny, an immature, unprofessional plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills. He had his heart broken years ago right before his wedding. He called the wedding off; now single, he wears his wedding band to the bars. Here he finds attractive women and convinces them that he is in an awful marriage. The random women feel sorry for him then automatically sleep with him (note to self: buy a wedding band today). He does this for 23 years; think about it - 23 years of one-night stands. <br/><br/>Danny finally meets the girl of his dreams, Palmer (played by Brooklyn Decker), at a party. She is a perfect ""10"" and she sleeps with him without even seeing his phony wedding band (note to self: go to more parties). When they awake, she finds his wedding band and thinks he is married. Palmer is 23 years old. This means when Danny started sleeping with random women, Palmer was in diapers. Does any one else find that creepy? <br/><br/>Since Danny has deep feelings for this particular one-night stand, he starts lying to her in order to keep her. His office assistant, Katherine (Played by Aniston) helps him in the lie by pretending to be Danny's soon-to-be ex-wife. Palmer wants to meet Danny's future ex-wife because of some issues she had with her own parents' divorce. They all meet at a restaurant where they don't talk about the divorce; it's frankly five minutes of Danny and Katherine insulting each other about their phony marriage that is about to end in a phony divorce. <br/><br/>The interaction between the three is almost done when Katherine receives a call from her kids and now Palmer wants to meet Danny's phony kids. Now we have to drag two kids into this web of lies. This storyline added some much needed fresh talent. The young actress, Bailee Madison who plays the daughter, did a wonderful job of pulling the spotlight onto herself since Aniston and Sandler weren't doing much to move out of their own comfort zone. <br/><br/>One lie leads to the next and they all end up in Hawaii. While on an impromptu family vacation with Danny, his girlfriend, his phony soon-to-be ex-wife, her phony soon-to-be husband (played by Nick Swardson) and the phony kids, the headache is getting bigger and the jokes are falling flatter. Through rampant coincidence the phony couple meets Katherine's old sorority sister and her husband (played by Nicole Kidman and Dave Matthews). Now we are presented a whole new lie and not a lot of fresh jokes to make it worth our time.<br/><br/>The entire story snowballs up to the part that the audience saw coming from about 15 minutes into the film. Danny soon finds who he should really be with; it shouldn't be much of a surprise if you have been following along. <br/><br/>Should you see this movie? No, it's just another Sandler film. If you are a die-hard Sandler fan you will probably see it regardless. He likes to find one joke and hold onto it through the film. Let it go, man; just because you talk in a funny voice doesn't mean you should do it all the time."
"DJ_Shilo","2","4","7","13 November 2017"," Don't Go With It
","I wonder what Dennis Dugan has to say about his newest picture starring Adam Sandler? After all, he directed Sandler in last years ""Grown Ups,"" which was moronic and unfunny but made a ton of cash and Dennis returns as director for ""Just Go With It"" so Sandler can phone it in to make more cash because no else will direct him. I am pretty sure there is a reason for that and this garbage adds to the mountain that this duo throws out every year. Even worse, how did they get the talented Nicole Kidman in this picture and turn her into a self-centered ditzy moron?<br/><br/>It's about, Danny Maccabee (Adam Sandler) who gets an awakening on his wedding day and decided to call it off. Soon after discovering his wedding band tells a million different stories to make woman stupidly sleep with him, twenty-three years pass and he is a successful plastic surgeon who is still pulling the same tricks. The only person aware of his schemes is his assistant, Katherine (Jennifer Aniston). While at a party, Danny meets, Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) and manages to screw up the encounter. It's not long before Danny finds himself hiding his secret from her and Katherine is roped into a divorce scheme that has everyone heading to Hawaii.<br/><br/>One of Sandler's buddies, Nick Swardson shows up in this picture as Danny's Goofball cousin, Eddie who I actually thought was funny until he started talking with a horrible fake German accent. If there is any salvage from this picture it is this idiot but that is running on thin ice. I would say funny because Katherine has to put up with his charades because the Palmer chick is completely clueless as to who he really is. She is under the assumption that Eddie is married to Katherine whose fake name turns out to be Devlin. Nicole Kidman turns out to be the real Devlin Adams and everything gets complicated. Of course, it does. Typical Adam Sandler picture but would you know everything turns out good in the end. Of course, it does.<br/><br/>Sandler has become good at ripping off the public and this picture is no different than his last hand full of garbage from ""Big Daddy"" to ""Waterboy"" to ""Zohan."" Here he is the usual self- centered jerk off who slowly realizes he is a jerk off halfway through the movie and someone special turns him around and he changes his ways. Whatever. This picture is apparently based on a French movie from 1969 and how much of that is actually this movie remains to be seen but I am pretty sure that fart jokes, usual Sandler humor, and complete stupidity where not present in Cactus Flower. The only thing that might save this mangy romcom is Jennifer Aniston but she has appeared in better. If anything I liked her sweet-natured character.<br/><br/>Here is a stupid scenario in the film that Sandler thought was funny but was not. It's his usual goofy quick-wit jokes and answers that makes him look unintelligent and dumb. One of his patients had bad plastic surgery and has one eyebrow much higher than the other and Sandler proceeds to laugh and make jokes out of the situation. He pulls down on the eyebrow, let's go and says, ""And it shoots right back up there."" She raises her eyebrow and he laughs and says ""You should watch that, it's going to get caught in your hair."" is this supposed to be funny? Eddie shows up and says ""Brows gone wild."" I had to take notes to remember this stupidity and finally, the woman shrugs off Eddie and he mentions a penial implant that he is obsessed with only to be laughed off. <br/><br/>Did I laugh once? Not really. I chuckled at a few parts where the Eddie character is sleeping in a bathtub because he is supposed to be the idiot of the group and a scene where he is chased by a wild boar hog and starts squealing in his fake German accent when caught but even that wasn't enough to hold the laughs throughout because I knew something stupid was coming shortly after and I was right. Sandler's character getting hit in the dingleberries. What a surprise. Nicole Kidman is a complete self-centered tool and she is useless. Her husband is played by the great Dave Matthews. He is forgettable like everyone else. The little tykes that play Katherine's kids are salvageable, Bailee Madison plays a sweet kid named Maggie who loves theater, does British accents and gets a stupid fake name, Kiki-Dee. Sandler is a jerk to her and her brother, Michael is played by Griffin Gluck. He has a problem with the bathroom because s**t jokes just need to be here and he looks like he is scared the whole picture. He must have seen Dennis Dugan?<br/><br/>Sandler needs to stop milking the public with these stupid comedies he keeps producing. It's bad enough that he receives worse actor over and over again but yet seems content with continuously making the same unfunny garbage. That is the easiest indicator that he is doing this for the money and has no remorse for ripping off audience members. It just makes me nervous to see what comes next. He has had a few good pictures in recent years such as the remake of ""The Longest Yard,"" ""50 First Dates"" and ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry."" I can tell you why these pictures worked. It's because Sandler was not surrounded by his usual crew of unfunny idiots and he actually tried to put on a good show. However, If Sandler is going to keep up this charade, he needs to find a new job because it's sad and Dennis Dugan should never be allowed to make another movie."

","From director Dennis Dugan (Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, Grown Ups), this looked like it could be a funny film starring the actress who has a habit for doing dodgy Rom-Coms, so I gave it a chance. Basically surgery doctor Danny Maccabee (Adam Sandler, also producing) has recently had disaster with a marriage which ended, but he still has the wedding ring, and to avoid commitment again he still wears it. He finds however that this ring is like a woman magnet as he pretends to be married and score with numerous sexy women who feel sympathy for him. Then Danny meets his dream girl who likes him for who he is, Palmer Dodge (Brooklyn Decker), and he really commits to their relationship, but of course the ring becomes a concern. He decides to make up a big lie and story with the help of doctor assistant and friend Katherine Palmer (Jennifer Aniston) that she is his recently separated wife and that they are getting a divorce. Everything seems alright, and Katherine enjoys taking advantage with Danny at the situation he has put himself in, and when Palmer hears the mention of children, Katherine's kids Maggie (Brothers' Bailee Madison) and Michael (Griffin Gluck) have to become part of the act too. The kids really push him to do something for them in order to keep the act going, Maggie pretending to be English as ""acting training"", and Michael tricking him to go on a trip to Hawaii so he can swim with dolphins. So all of the ""family"" and Palmer go to the tropical paradise, and as they individually have a good time, Danny is of course trying to cover up lie after lie, while Katherine is urging him to tell the girl he seems to love the truth. A few distractions pop up, such as Katherine coming up against the woman she doesn't particularly like, the fake name she is using and the woman she named her kids' poop after, Devlin Adams (Nicole Kidman), and having to put up with extra vacationer Eddie (Nick Swardson) pretending to be a German ""boyfriend"" named Dolph Lundgren. Danny thinks the best idea would be to propose to Palmer, make their relationship official, but of course as time has gone by Katherine has gained feelings for him, and it may be vice versa as well. In the end, the long truth does come out as Danny decides that he doesn't have the same feelings for Palmer as he does for Katherine and his family, and they return home united like a real family. Also starring Dave Matthews as Ian Maxtone Jones, Kevin Nealon as Adon and Heidi Montag as Adon's Wife. Sandler is reasonably good as the pressured guy lying through his teeth all the way, Aniston is alright as the sassy woman ""going with it"", Kidman stands out with her time belly dancing and being annoying, and Decker is really hot as the sexy girlfriend, the story is patchy in places, and you find yourself unable to stick to all the fake facts and stuff, but there are some things to laugh at, not a terrible romantic comedy. Okay!"

","'JUST GO WITH IT': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Another generic Adam Sandler vehicle, this one teaming Sandler with Jennifer Aniston and re-teaming him with director Dennis Dugan (who also directed 'HAPPY GILMORE', 'BIG DADDY', 'I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY', 'YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN' and 'GROWN UPS'). It's written by Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling and based on a 1969 film called 'CACTUS FLOWER' which was based on a Broadway stage play and a French play. It tells the story of a womanizing plastic surgeon (Sandler) who convinces his loyal assistant (Aniston) to pretend to be his wife for the weekend in order to deceive a young woman (Brooklyn Decker) he's trying to win over. The story is illogical, predictable and another step downward in the once great comedic career of Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>Sandler plays Danny Maccabbee, a once 'funny looking' goof who turned to plastic surgery (in order to fix his own problems with attracting ladies) twenty years earlier when his fiancée broke his heart on their wedding day. He also learned the clever art of deception and tricking women into thinking he's unhappily married (by wearing a wedding ring) in order to attract sympathy sex. After meeting a women half his age, named Palmer, and falling for her he talks his assistant, Katherine Murphy, into playing the part of his abusive wife who he says he's divorcing. Then when Palmer discovers Katherine has kids Danny idiotically tells her their his and has to carry on the charade for an entire Hawaiian trip vacation (with Katherine's family).<br/><br/>Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston are both talented and funny actors but they do an extremely poor job of picking roles. Here they're both funny in places and have some chemistry but the script is too poorly written for either to do too much of anything impressive with. Anniston has always been known for doing work far beneath her talents but Sandler used to make funny movies, once upon a time. Now everything he does is so formulaic and forced (a lot like TV sitcoms) and lacking of any originality or witty humor whatsoever. They do always do well at the box office though and it's good in today's economy to see the rich keep getting richer. The film's one saving grace is a nice supporting turn from Nicole Kidman though who surprisingly makes the movie a little more watchable. All in all it's about what anyone should expect from an Adam Sandler stock comedy.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0"

If you like Sandler's older stuff then you will love this movie. He goes back to his basics with humor in this one. Sure it's totally far-fetched, but the humor makes it worth it. Also like his older movies, there were those few moments that were so sweet that made you wish you had your own ""egg-head."" Jennifer Aniston was awesome in this movie. She's a funny girl, but has been given bad material in the past. This was just what she needed. She was sexy, funny, and totally knew her roll. Plus, she had such great chemistry with Sandler.

","One word; WOW. This is by far my favourite film of all time! The script is absolutely fantastic and it's very very funny. There are times when you laugh, there are times when you go 'aw!', and there are times when you can really relate to what the characters are saying, and, being 12, I found it extremely heart-warming and hilarious. Also living in England, I thought Maggie's British accent was spot on, although it was kinda stereotyped. My mum bought me the DVD of it today, and I'm really happy because, since it's not playing on Sky anymore, I can laugh again and again. I'd recommend this film to anyone who likes a good laugh and an 'aw' moment! I think the cast is absolutely brilliant and they just have this on screen chemistry that adds to the film's fabulousness, especially Bailee and Griffin.

","I liked the film, as it contained lots of easy-going understandable humor - but nothing old or usual. Very witty. One doesn't feel bored even for a second. Even when the characters are acting repetitively, it goes over very quickly or was intended to be like that. There are unexpected twists and turns in the story. The plot is inventive. The characters in the film like think up their own movie on the spot, being creative in the process and there's the good happy ending. To surprise the viewer, it Does come unexpectedly! All actors do their part very well. The credit goes to Adam Sandler, who fits in his role like the hand fits in a glove. The movie certainly made my mood better, but I must emphasize it depends on a person. If you hate these types of comedies, don't see it.

Rated this awful not because of the acting or he storytelling but just for the above mentioned fact. The movie is quite good.

Most women fall for him and his irresistible charms. The only person who has not fallen for him is his dutiful nurse Naina (Sushmita Sen).<br/><br/>Whenever a girl gets too close to Samir and starts talking about marriage, he sends her off by telling her he is already married. However, one day, he meets Sonia (Katrina Kaif), a beautiful young woman and Samir is smitten.He lies to her about having a wife, but the marriage is failing. When she learns of his 'wife', she wants to meet her—and Samir introduces Naina, as well as her niece and nephew, as his wife and children.<br/><br/>Samir then arranges a fake divorce from his fake wife with the help of his best friend, lawyer Vicky (Arshad Warsi) who, despite having a steady girlfriend (Ishaa Koppikar), frequently flirts with Naina. To complicate things further, Samir's mother (Beena Kak) suddenly appears and doesn't want her son get divorced from Naina (when he isn't married to her in the first place). And then, there is Sonia's neighbor Pyare (Sohail Khan), who does not want Sonia to marry Samir: he wants Sonia for his own and she seems to like him, too.<br/><br/>The web of lies around everyone grows thicker and thicker, but finally, Samir is able to persuade Sonia to marry him.

"Stoh80","4","4","8","6 October 2011"," A predictable and stale ""comedy""
","I used to like Adam Sandler's movies. Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer, even 50 First Dates. They were funny, and though they weren't in the least sense intellectually stimulating, they were at least entertaining. I can't say any of these things about Just Go With It. This is one of my least favorite movies of 2011, and that's no exaggeration.<br/><br/>This is a ""brainless comedy,"" only without the comedy. The jokes are stale and have been done countless times in other, better movies. The plot is disjointed and unbelievable. The reason the audience suspends their disbelief is so they can be rewarded with comedy, or in the very least some form of entertainment, but when that isn't provided, all we are left with is a very pathetic Adam Sandler trying to impress some random woman so he can (I guess?) marry her. The characters are as dumb as can be, and none of the main actors Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston, or Brooklyn Decker share chemistry. It seems like none of the characters can think five minutes into the future, which has the potential to be funny if the audience wasn't expected to feel sympathetic towards Adam Sandler's character. Save your time, for this could very well be Adam Sandler's worst film yet."

","If you are in the mood for a relaxing movie filled with good laughs I would definitely suggest seeing Just Go With It. Its suitable for old and young alike.

More lies bring more jokes and by the end it can be hard to keep track yet it's still understandable. Adam and Jennifer don't disappoint as its a classic romantic comedy. It's definitely one to buy and keep for a boring Saturday night. Its a happy ending filled with hilarious moments. It is definitely worth the 10 dollars!!"
"gwynjones2001","8","4","8","16 April 2011"," ridiculous plot... but very funny, and surprisingly heart-warming
","The plot is utterly ridiculous, but I'll try to summarize anyway, just for giggles: A successful plastic surgeon (Sandler) is a horndog who wears a wedding ring because it helps him score with chicks. But then he meets a Cute Young Chick (Decker) who he wants to have a relationship with... but she finds the ring in his pants, and goes nuts because she won't date married men. So the Good Doctor makes up a marriage (to his Kind Assistant, played by Anniston) and impending divorce (because of her infidelity with Dolph Lundgren, but not THAT Dolph Lundgren). And Cute Young Chick now wants to meet the (soon to be ex) wife, just so she can check he's really telling the truth. It happens all the time, I'm sure.<br/><br/>Now, if you can believe this (it's Anniston, after all), Kind Assistant is a Plain Jane, so now the Good Doctor has to take her for an Extreme Makeover, so she can look like a well-maintained Hollywood Wife. Then the two girls meet, it goes great... but, at the end of the evening, Kind Assistant gets a call from her kids, and forgets the role play. So, now, Cute Young Chick thinks the Good Doctor has kids... and now she wants to meet THEM, to see if he's a good father.<br/><br/>The Crazy Kids extort the Good Doctor in return for pretending to be his children, and get a bunch of acting classes, video games, food... and a family trip to Hawaii to swim with the dolphins. If you've stayed with me so far, you can picture the sunshine and beaches of Hawaii, with the Good Doctor, his would-be girlfriend the Cute Young Chick, his fake wife, the fake wife's fake boyfriend, the fake Dolph Lundgren. And, of course, the fake wife's real kids, posing as the Good Doctor's fake kids.<br/><br/>To add to the fake-ness, Nicole Kidman and Dave Mathews show up as a third couple, Kidman being the hyper-competitive bitchy high school friend of Anniston's, who's a pretentious fake. And Mathews as her boyfriend and inventor of the iPod. He's fake too, because he's not the inventor of the iPod, and he's gay, so not much use on the boyfriend front. Now, Kind Assistant is playing awful about-to-be ex-wife of Good Doctor around Cute Young Chick... but is forced to play real Kind Assistant around Kidman and Mathews... with wonderful marriage to hugely successful Good Doctor, as a bit of relationship one-upmanship.<br/><br/>Maybe it's better if you think of it as a farce.<br/><br/>While there, Good Doctor realizes that Crazy Kids and Kind Assistant are the ones he loves, rather than Cute Young Chick. I bet you didn't see that one coming.<br/><br/>The kids are great, a deadpan boy (Griffin Gluck), and an aspiring actress girl (Bailee Madison), putting on a Mary Poppins English accent, with extra helping of Dick van Dyke. Luckily, they have some very nice awwww, ain't kids adorable moments.<br/><br/>Anniston does a really great job of being kind and lovable. Dolph Lundgren (Nick Swardson, a Sandler regular) is a hoot as Anniston's fake boyfriend, with some kind of Schwarzenneger-ish German-ish accent, as a dot-com sheep entrepreneur. Brooklyn Decker just has to be cute and sweet, and she does a pretty good job for a model. And, given that she's an SI cover girl, she did well at being cute, but not too smoking hot to be involved in all these shenanigans.<br/><br/>And Sandler ties it all together, with the usual Sandler shtick. But better than usual, and much more genuine. He's a bit more grown-up, and a bit more toned-down, than most of his roles.<br/><br/>The Sandler/Anniston connection is very sweet and believable, and it's what carries the film. Overall, I think this is one of the best things I've seen both Anniston and Sandler do. It was a thoroughly engaging and enjoyable couple of hours. It's a great date movie with lots of sweetness and romance, with a bit of Sandleresque stupid stuff going on to keep the guys distracted."

"langsts21","7","4","8","28 February 2011"," A good movie
","Just Go With It reminds me of The Wedding Singer (which I don't like) and 50 First Dates (which I like). This movie and the other two are romantic comedies with Adam Sandler. Adam Sandler is rarely in romantic comedies, but he usually does well when he is. I normally hate romantic comedies, but I like Adam Sandler so I gave it a try. There were funny moments, but none of them were laugh out loud funny (the people in front of me at the movie theater apparently disagree). The love triangle was actually pretty interesting. Adam Sandler's character is attracted to a 20 something year old and to cover up his previous lies, he pretends that he has a wife (his secretary) and that they are breaking up. He also has trouble deciding who he loves more – his same age secretary or the 20 something year old. Some of the jokes are mean spirited such as the one with the lady that has an eyebrow that is up way higher than the other eyebrow and Adam Sandler's character throwing his secretary's daughter in the mud. I would be lying if I said that I didn't find the eyebrow jokes funny. The joke with the sheep dying was hilarious, but not laugh out loud hilarious. Sure, Adam Sandler's character did a horrible thing by lying and forming a fake family in order to get together with a 20 something year old, but he did right in the end. How did he do right? Find out when you watch this movie."
"jonnyhavey","7","4","8","17 February 2011"," Chaos In Hawaii
","On the surface ""Just Go With It"" is just another Adam Sandler critic hate fest, however, Sandler is one of the best modern comedians and brings home the laughs once again. The film is actually based on the 1969 film ""Cactus Flower"" which received its roots from the French play ""Fleur de cactus"". However, besides the basic plot outline, Adam Sandler's version is vastly different including his trademark crazy, rude, over the top humor. Needless to say Sandler has not lost his way. Sandler's character Danny Maccabee has his heart broken by his fiancé on his wedding day. This leads him to a bar where he is found sulking while still wearing his wedding ring. He discovers that while every other guy in the bar strikes out attempting to hit on Joanna Damon (Minka Kelly, ""The Roommate"", ""Gossip Girl""), his wedding ring attracts her to him. This combined with a made up story about how his wife beats him makes her feel bad for him and ultimately sleeping with him. His success leads him to continue his scheme even after becoming a wealthy plastic surgeon, until he meets a woman named Palmer (Brooklyn Decker). She gets extremely upset after finding his wedding ring in his pocket the morning after sleeping with him demanding an explanation. He tells her that he is in the process of getting a divorce and asks his best lady friend and assistant Katherine Murphy (Jennifer Anistan) to act as if she was his wife (soon to be ex). His lie grows more and more that Danny convinces Katherine's kids, Maggie (Bailee Madison, ""Brothers"") and Michael (Griffin Gluck) to play the role of his kids. Everything culminates in a ""family"" trip to Chaos Hawaii with Danny, Palmer, Katherine, Maggie, Michael and Danny's cousin Eddie (Nick Swardson), where (throughout the chaos) Danny finds out that his heart is actually taking him towards the woman that knows him best.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler has been creating very unique romantic comedies for years that are able to reach out to a wider audience. ""Just Go With It"" is most definitely a romantic comedy, however, it does not stick it in your face. Instead the film slowly lets the viewer know that the rom-com is there allowing it to have a lot of fun. This is also achieved by creating characters that are all very likable and not stereotypical. Even Katherine's nemesis, Devlin, played by Nicole Kidman turns out to be a very likable character. Lastly, what does every Adam Sandler film need? Well Adam Sandler' mastery of creating good entertainment.<br/><br/>The film starts off on a really weak note with very little relevance to the rest of the film. After the opening segment relevance grows, however, the film doesn't really get going until the whole ""family"" goes to Hawaii. This creates a very stereotypical cliché experience. Everything in the film has been done before leaving no surprises except some random undeveloped comical interjections which have become a pattern in the past couple years.<br/><br/>The film's ending is very predictable, however, Director Dennis Dugan does not throw it in your face allowing the viewer to enjoy the humor of Adam Sandler. This is one of the most entertaining comedies that has come out in a while so ""Just Go To It"" now."
"insertwittyusername","8","4","8","12 February 2011"," Just Going with It
","What ""Just Go with It"" lacks in witty and clever dialog, it certainly makes up for with enthusiasm. The actors make the film work. I'm a big Jennifer Aniston fan, and when I saw the previews for this movie I thought, oh no, she's doing another rom com that's going to go to the dogs. However, Aniston and Adam Sandler work very well off each other and their natural chemistry gives an entirely far fetched plot a natural feel. And let's face it, it's a romantic comedy. People don't go see rom coms to be blown away by the incredible script and mind blowing plot; they go to laugh and feel good for a few hours. It was funny and I found myself laughing more often than I thought I was going to. Brooklyn Decker, Dave Matthews, and Bailee Madison all gave solid performances, but it was Nicole Kidman who really stole the show. Her rivalry with Aniston as her ex-sorority sister was the most believable part of the movie ergo the most enjoyable (the hula dance off was absolutely priceless). The thing that the film easily could have and should have excluded was Nick Swardson's character Eddie. His annoying accent and inappropriate jokes were completely unnecessary and quite frankly made it a whole lot more unpleasant. All in all, I enjoyed it and thought it was a great way to kill two hours."

Something about this movie reminded me of Blended. Was it because the same actor played in both, or maybe because it had to do with children and vocation to an exotic resort? Maybe. With Just go with it, the jokes are funny and that adds to the film, that, other than that, it's pretty much predictable. I mean, you get what will happen from the movie trailer.

","Sandler should stick to doing movies he didn't have a hand in writing. Not sure who is better at pulling off often sophomoric humor. Aniston is great and works well with Sandler. The jokes are often fast and furious. There is a lot of absurdity, as per usual, but if you suspend your disbelief, realize you are watching a typical Sandler comedy and enjoy the goof ball jokes then you're fine. I also recommend watching it more than once. Kind of like 50 first dates it gets better the more you watch it. There are some characters that can be very annoying but overall it is a funny movie and works. I'd prefer they didn't cast Kidman but she is meant to be annoying anyway so it works well for people who dislike her anyway."

He convinces his assistant to pose as his ex-wife, and he uses her children, to pretend they're his children.

","An awful lot of Adam Sandler films are stupid, unfunny, poorly written and forgettable, but every now and then comes a film featuring Sandler that works, and Just Go With It is that film. It's similar to my favourite comedy Easy A in the way that's there an overwhelming sense of fun and joy, but Just Go With It adds in a silly nature but it's a tolerable and fitting silly nature, whisking along it's quirky characters into nutty situations. In this romantic comedy, Sandler is Danny, an unlucky in love plastic surgeon who finds ""the one"", but after a lie backfires, he must recruit his loyal assistant Katherine (Anniston) to play his ex-wife in order to win his love's heart, all this catastrophic lying ends Danny, Katherine and her kids in Hawaii, where the lengths we go for love is shown. Whilst the performances are nothing groundbreaking like the ones in Crazy, Stupid, Love, the cast here are clearly having fun, and Adam Sandler doesn't phone it in, he's actually great. Dennis Dugan isn't a great director but this time around he proves he can do good, and it shows through the characters connecting and playing off on one another. Top class comedy, highly recommended."

Everything was running smooth until she stump upon and found his wedding ring. Feeling upset, Maccabee tries to make up for it by creating a lie.<br/><br/>Creating a lie that he has no other choice but to use his assistant, Murphy, to be his ""fake-soon-to-be-ex-wife"". So he decided to make her dress elegantly sexy and hot. Things got worsen after the two girls met when Murphy grab a call from her daughter.<br/><br/>This scene makes Palmer feel insecure and cheated, and that she feels she is destroying a beautiful when she's ""not"". Maccabee then declares that he ""has"" two wonderful children. Palmer is surprised of Maccabee loving kids and so does she. And she would love to meet them.<br/><br/>Following day, Maccabee offers Murphy's kids to play along in return, he will give what they want. Murphy's daughter â€“ Maggie Murphy (Bailee Madison) wants US$ 800 per day and 3 weeks of acting classes (deal closes at US$ 300 per day and 5 weeks of acting classes) and her son Michael Murphy (Griffin Gluck) wants a trip to Hawaii to swim with the dolphins but only gets his bargain to get unlimited tokens for some arcade game (he still gets to go to Hawaii).<br/><br/>On the day, Maccabee brought his ""family"" to meet Palmer and Maggie puts up a British accent surprising Murphy and Maccabee â€“ they have to lie that she went to a boarding school in England.<br/><br/>At lunch, Michael was looking very upset that his ""dad"" broke his promise to bring him to Hawaii â€“ Palmer finds this outrageous. The wicked smile was hidden under his sad face leaving Maccabee without any choices but to bring everyone to Hawaii.<br/><br/>At the airport, it was a coincidence that Maccabee met his cousin Eddie Simms (Nick Swardson) who was running away and was also under the disguise as Dolph Lundgren â€“ thus becoming Murphy's lover. (Oh! By the way, Murphy's fake name is Devlin, Maggie is Kiki Dee, Michael is Bart)<br/><br/>Eddie aka Dolph aka Devlin's lover with a weird German accent said his occupation was an Austrian sheep salesman.

"hlemense","8","2","3","25 September 2013"," Just Go With It
","Just Go With It is a film about a fake married man, Daniel Maccabee, who makes his way through life by going to a bar every Friday night to pick up younger girls. In order to get these girls, he pretends to be married to a wife who doesn't appreciate him, beats him, and cheats on him. Danny (Adam Sandler) is a plastic surgeon in Southern California who thinks he has met the love of his life, Palmer (Brooklyn Decker). In order to be with her, he needs to prove to her that he is indeed getting a divorce with his 'wife', Katherine (Jennifer Aniston), and that his life with her is indeed over. The movie follows a normal chick-flick theme but allows for twists and turns throughout, allowing you to guess what will happen until the end of the film. Director, Dennis Dugan, portrayed a well put together, overly dramatized dating fairy tale. While this is an Adam Sandler production, it is much more family orientated than films such as, That's my Boy, Billy Madison, and Happy Gilmore. Of course the film kept some of the 'Adam Sandler comedy' such as when a little boy runs into his 'junk' and yells, ""He put his pee-pee on my face!"" Danny yells back, ""He put his face on my pee-pee!"" While the actors fit their characters perfectly, a few parts were greatly dramatized. Jennifer Aniston was her normal cheery self in the film, while Adam Sandler tried to take on a more fatherly approach rather than being a bachelor. The music throughout the video was very fitting with the setting. The music selections such as ""Chasing Cars"" by Snow Patrol and ""Every Breath You Take"" by The Police were properly played during moments which could persuade your predictions of the movie to go the other way. The 'follow your heart' scenes, as I like to call them, where the character is forced to make a life altering decision, is where the vast majority of these songs appeared in the movie. The plot was very sound. There was no part in the movie where the audience could get confused as to what was happening. The film was very easy to follow, but if you were to stop watching the film, you would be highly likely to miss something funny or important. The plot was organized, well planned, and full of laughs, and the directing was well done for this romantic comedy. The lighting, script, and musical input made this a well done film. The lighting and comedy were always there in the right place and time. If you are looking for a romantic comedy, that will get you laughing, this is the film to see. Adam Sandler keeps this film clean with limited amounts of swearing and nudity (bikinis and underwear, of course!). The PG-13 criteria fits the rating well. The plot was solid, acting was sometimes over dramatic, but never cheesy, and the effects were wonderful. The movie seemed almost realistic, except the scenario was a little over the top."
"Bruce722","8","2","3","18 August 2013"," One of Sandler's better family films.
","Just Go With It is actually a really good movie with plenty of laughs. Adam Sandler has struggled as he's transitioned to more family oriented films to keep his edgy and outlandish style but this is proof that he's still got it. Jennifer Aniston has one of her best roles ever where she isn't completely intolerable. While both of the stars are outstanding, the biggest laughs come from Nick Swardson. He is so ridiculous and out there that he can pull off the craziest of roles. Also, unlike most comedy movies, this film isn't full of annoying moments that never seem to end. Then you throw in the beautiful Brooklyn Decker, who actually is a decent enough actress, and you have yourself a movie worth watching."
"strohljared","8","2","3","28 June 2013"," It's not Old Sandler, but it's good enough
","This movie was much better than I thought it would be. I agree with all the negative things people say about it, but that doesn't change my opinion that this movie is genius. The only downside to the movie is that throughout the first time watching it I was constantly thinking ""this blonde chick can't be this stupid..."", but all the hilarity that happens made up for it. I never cared for Jennifer Aniston, but i see her in a different light now after watching this. never found her sexy either. now I do. The Blonde chick (don't know her name) wasn't really a character. just the person all the hilarity revolves around. Sandler, of course, is always on his game. He's selfish and at times cruel, but under all of it he shows his big ole' heart. His interaction with the children who play in the movie is perfect. The children by the way are great. The little girl was too funny. i don't want to spoil anything, but the girl is into acting and improv in the movie, which I think makes this movie genius because YOU KNOW there is some improv going on, and not just with Sandler, but with a lot of the actors playing alongside him, including Jennifer Aniston. Nick Swardson is quirky and adds some strange humor to the table, but all in all works out. Don't want to spoil anything else, but there are two guest appearances toward third part of the film that turn things up a notch. Just think of a coconut clenched between your butt cheeks.... 8/10 for this charming movie that me and my cousin can't stop watching. It's going right on my shelf alongside with Little Nicky, Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore, and many others. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go make a ""devlin""."
"vchimpanzee","Null","2","3","20 June 2013"," Just go with it!
","I like Adam Sandler movies. I like Jennifer Aniston romantic comedies. Or any movies she is in. I like movies where people try to deceive others.<br/><br/>So you know I'm going to like this one! I have just one complaint. I had to use my brain too much. It's too hard to keep up with all the lies.<br/><br/>But you know what they say. When you lie once, you have to tell ten times as many lies to cover up the first one. Here, one little white lie--okay, a big white lie--turns into many lies as new details have to be explained. Add in scheming kids who blackmail their fake Dad who has money, and a couple of unexpected developments, and the formula is complete chaos.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is not a pathetic loser here. Well, he sort of is. Despite being on of the top plastic surgeons in Los Angeles, he can't get out of this jam he is in without spending a ton of money. And is it worth it? Well, Brooklyn Decker is gorgeous. And she looks great in a bikini. Plus she shows up in a towel and you hope it's going to come off. And it does. From the back. Even though it was FX, which allowed G.D. and the middle finger, nothing more was visible than one would see on broadcast TV. But it was a treat for a brief time. I only wish I had known who she was. I feel like I knew her when, as a local TV news reporter did a feature on this wholesome girl next door who happened to be a famous swimsuit model. As an actress, she is pleasant and a little on the bubblehead side, but as a teacher, the character has to be halfway intelligent.<br/><br/>But is the grass always greener on the other side? Don't people sometimes already have what they want without realizing it? Jennifer Aniston is also really good-looking despite her age. And she always has that great hair, regardless of the style. She even looks good with glasses. And what a body! I didn't know what to expect when she started taking off her clothes. And if you liked that, there's a hula scene which is a bonus.<br/><br/>But it's not just how she looks. She nearly always plays these intelligent characters who roll their eyes at what they have to put up with. She's the same type character here. Very appealing, and willing to do whatever it takes. And she might just be rewarded. Well, the expensive clothes and other perks are at least part of the reward.<br/><br/>I should mention that one scene that keeps this from being just a formula movie takes place between Devlin and Devlin (Yes, I have to say that her nemesis from college shows up--just as she uses the woman's name for Danny's fake wife). That's really all I can say. It's an unexpected situation and proof these characters can be more than stereotypes.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, about Devlin. Nicole Kidman does a wonderful job with a perpetually happy but often nasty character.<br/><br/>I don't know anything about Nick Swardson, and I'm still not quite sure who he is, but he somehow ended up in this mess torturing poor Katherine as her fake Eastern European boyfriend Dolph. I thought he was supposed to be Russian, but I'm not quite sure. Very over-the-top, when in character.<br/><br/>And what cute kids. Maggie is quite a schemer herself, and very proper English as ""Kiki Dee"". Or is that Audrey Hepburn in ""My Fair Lady""? Very funny, regardless. Michael also manages to get what he wants in exchange for portraying ""Bart"", though he didn't quite think it through. One of his fantasies was Hawaii, so naturally this dysfunctional group ends up there, with entirely new fake story lines to present to others.<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of Dave Matthews, the singer or the actor. But the man who is both does a good job here as a pretentious inventor who expects the best of everything because, after all, he has money. And Devlin (the real one) just loves him.<br/><br/>So, will everyone end up with who they should? All this scheming results in some important realizations. But the question is whether those will lead to what should take place.<br/><br/>The result is a real winner."

","When I saw trailers for this I didn't think much of it, but I decided to watch it online because I was bored..and, to my surprise, I really enjoyed it!<br/><br/>Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston had a surprising amount of chemistry (not heaps of it, but it was sufficient enough to make the film entertaining), which I wasn't expecting at all!<br/><br/>The film had a happy ending (you could call it predictable, but as I know from experience, an unexpected ending usually isn't one you want) which left me feeling happy after watching this!<br/><br/>The film was very funny and I laughed particularly hard when Dolf (is that how it's spelt?)pushed Palmer in the pool! Very funny!<br/><br/>Some things, however, were less than stellar. For instance, Kiki-D's British accent was annoying. Also, when kids are smart alecks, it's just annoying to listen to.<br/><br/>But it didn't impede my overall enjoyment of the film, so I've given it a 7/10!"
"tayloraggz","8","2","3","14 May 2013"," A perfect duo
","Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston are two of my favourite actors, and just having both of them in one film, is outstanding. It's pretty simple, if you enjoy one of them, you will not be disappointed. It's a warm loving, yet cringy funny film. <br/><br/>By cringy, I mean as if I can't bare to watch as bad things keep happening and backfiring.. The love story between these two is amazing, and yet the storyline is very easy to follow and understand. Good on you, best romantic comedy I have seen in a while. I'm glad everything worked out for the best in the end, I would recommend this film, and happily watch it over and over again."
"thepotatoHasEyes","8","2","3","28 February 2013"," ONE OF ADAM SANDLERS BEST-everything you would experts from a comedy
","#1. don't listen to the bad critics on this one.(better than waterboy?)<br/><br/>#2.-a general comedy rule(for those seeking meaning)- The better the comedy the thinner the plot. the stronger the plot the more you get bogged down in drama. DRAMA-its a movie category. <br/><br/>I have not seen sandler's movies in chronological order , i saw jack and jill before seeing this one ... i hated jack and jill (and some other recent sandler movies)so i had that ""lost a friend"" feeling about sandler- he's one of my fav's when he's good',- so this film hit me like an old friend that i hadn't seen in years showing up. so many funny lines ,-if you love jen an., you get to watch her get spoiled freely for no reason , that was great , she's wonderful, beautiful and funny-does she ever get that credit-she's funny. nick swordson has never been funnier than this , his best role.<br/><br/>The whole movie is summed up at 48 min's in, when swordson delivers the line: ""ok, ya, I would create a fake family for that, Oh My Gawd"".--more than one or two belly laughs-- <br/><br/>comedy can have thin plot, this does, but , it has comedy written by comedy professionals delivered by comedy professionals- this is a professional comedy that is at the top of it's class-- and i loved the ""police"" heavy soundtrack."
"raulfaust","7","2","3","24 October 2012"," Give It To Me
","Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston play two unique characters that develop a weird relationship after trying to pretend to be married. In fact, they only do that because Sandler's character wants to impress a young girl. Some scenes are interesting and creative, and so is the plot, but some things are over the top-- for instance, the stupid non-sense lies they make up all the time. Children's performance is great, even thought it seems to be one of their first works. In order to see a different ending, I admit I didn't want them to end up together-- that would be so clichÃ©d and predictable. Unfortunately they did, which is the reason why I don't give it a higher rating-- I expected some innovation in this aspect. All in all, it's a great work, congratulations."
"sun-seven","8","2","3","17 June 2012"," Not at all as bad as the critics say
","I was lucky not to listen to the mostly negative reviews on rottentomatoes otherwise I would have missed a truly funny and also charming movie with something in it for everybody, even children. The reason why this is not the typical dumb ass comedy is because it is an original screwball comedy and to call it predictable is nonsense since the predictability is the essence of the genre. We do not want to know if but how. Therefore we need real characters with a life and not just situation based punch lines. This little* film provides both of it. The dialogues were mostly believable, they sometimes sounded even a little improvised between Sandler and Aniston. All in all a good entertainment with nothing to be ashamed of and even worth watching more than once.<br/><br/>*In fact, it is not as little as it should be. It is an awful tendency to blow up movies to two hours (why do they do this?). Often, the story does not deliver enough for that length so they come up with lot of side stuff that sometimes has nothing to do with the plot at all and has the quality of filler material. I would have deleted at least 30 Minutes of this movie and then it could have been even better."
"amritanand888","7","2","3","17 March 2012"," entertaining and romantic at the same time; a gud movie after all
","This is a romantic comedy which I have seen after days, which has actually the elements of comedy. You would laugh your stomach out. The story-telling is so nice that even though every thing seems quiet predictable, it still grips you to the end. The acting was superb, I mean, Aniston, Sandler have both done a great job. I especially like the raunchy double-meaning dialogues which will make you laugh all the time. Brooklyn has also done a good job playing a role of a nice lady. Watch out for the curves and big coconuts of the ladies and the yellow bikini. Some scenes are quiet romantic and the chemistry between the actors are great. In short, if you want a funny and romantic movie to spend your time,"" Just go with it"" is a perfect choice. You won't get bored!!!"
"JinxsterJones","9","2","3","10 March 2012"," Sandler on Form!
","Just finished watching this one and I can honestly say (despite all the lies in the movie!!) that I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in ages. I was laughing out loud on several occasions! Not since ""The Hangover"" have I laughed out loud so much. Some cracking moments. Yes, of course the storyline is nuts, but when it's written and acted so well, who cares! Sandler was at his best (""Wedding Singer"" standard) and Jennifer Aniston was wonderful! The rest of the cast all played their parts well too, but it's the scenes between Sandler & Aniston that I enjoyed the most. A most enjoyable movie that I'm sure I will return to again sometime, without hesitation!!"
"vincentlynch-moonoi","7","2","3","27 November 2011"," Heart Not Fart
","From my perspective, Adam Sandler makes two kinds of movies. Some of them are at the level of ""fart humor"", and I don't find those movies worth my time. But Sandler also makes movies with ""heart"", and I find him quite appealing in those films. This is one of the latter (other examples include ""50 First Dates"" and ""Spanglish"").<br/><br/>He's made so many ""fart"" movies lately that I was beginning to lose interest in him as an actor, but he redeemed himself in this film. And, somehow I've never happened to watch Jennifer Aniston in a film before, and I was rather impressed with her performance.<br/><br/>Although this is a ""heart"", not ""fart"" movie, that's not to say there isn't some bawdy humor here...for example the woman with one huge breast and one small breast. But what is highlighted in this film is Sandler's romantic side and his relationship with Aniston's character's kids. ANd, incidentally, the boy --Griffin Gluck -- well, I have a feeling we'll be seeing a lot more of him in the future.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Nicole Kidman would take her role in the film. Apparently her star has fallen just a bit, but in this supporting role she is quite entertaining. Apparently Sandler is quite taken with the comedy-acting abilities of Nick Swardson, although I don't see the attraction.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film. Very funny, yet also pleasantly romantic...not a combination that always comes off well. Probably not one for you DVD shelf, but an entertaining watch, none-the-less."
"vivianla","9","1","1","10 June 2020"," Hooking Up and Beautiful Love
","Adam Sandler's personality is so funny and charming. He reminds me of this Greek guy I went to high school with. Jennifer Aniston is shown in a less glamorous state as an assistant.<br/><br/>We first see Adam who is a plastic surgeon who is about to get married, only to look into the room where the girls are gossiping about him. He is heartbroken and does not end up getting married. He has a giant nose and goes to a bar feeling sad. It is loud with lots of people talking.<br/><br/>A really hot dark-haired girl comes in and gets the attention of all the boys. She sits at the bar only for the doc to also talk to her, trying to tell her about her bag on the ground. She gets annoyed saying, ""Can't I sit down for 10 seconds without being hit on?"". Danny who is the doctor tells her he was trying to tell her about her bag and lies to her about being married and having a horrible wife. They go out together with the jealous men calling out insults and it is assumed they have sex.<br/><br/>Now Danny (who gets a nose job and plastic surgery as we see him looking more handsome later) uses this method. He uses his method of lying to girls of his marital problems and how his wife treats him to get girls to have sex with him.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston is his assistant and there is a funny scene where they prep up a woman with one breast way bigger than the other. Danny tells the woman to undress and take off her brassiere. Jen starts rubbing down her nipples with something to numb and tugs at them, asking the woman if she feels anything. Danny holds up the bra that has two different cup sizes and asks the client if she made it herself.<br/><br/>Danny goes to a party at a luxurious home with a pool. A very attractive girl comes out saying a boy got hurt. Her body is goals. Danny goes to help the boy out and the boy tells Danny of a girl he was gawking at which made him get hurt. Danny comes out as he finished helping the boy and Palmer comes walking to him. She is a stunning blonde.<br/><br/>Dan and Palmer go to the beach. They have sex and Palmer has to leave as she is a teacher. She finds a ring in Dan's pocket and is furious that she slept with a married man.<br/><br/>Dan goes to the school Palmer works at and she is dressed really pretty. Dan continues to lie to Palmer saying he is divorced. The string of lies that Palmer believes in is unrealistic. Palmer insists she meet this ex before she continues to see Danny.<br/><br/>Danny takes his secretary out for luxury shopping to make her into his hot ex-wife. He wants this fantasy. Jen tries on heels and stumbles saying she has not worn heels in a while.<br/><br/>Dan meets Palmer at some side seats and she is dressed beautifully. Palmer's outfits in this movie which are numerous are all beautiful.<br/><br/>Out comes Jennifer Aniston and she gets the attention of the guys behind her who stare at her. At the end Jen screws up when she picks up a call about her daughter selling her son's belongings and gets angry. Palmer is surprised to learn they have kids. Palmer says she loves kids and wants to meet them.<br/><br/>Dan takes Jen's two kids to lunch where he has to make deals in order to get them to pretend to be his kids. Jen is shocked and they go meet Palmer.<br/><br/>Palmer is dressed beautifully again and the kids screw up everything. Danny wants to look good so he tells them he is taking them to Hawaii as the son made him look bad by saying their dad didn't take him to Hawaii to swim with dolphins.<br/><br/>Jen thinks this is crazy and at the airport we find another man comes to join them. Jen and Dan know him.<br/><br/>The group reaches Hawaii. Palmer is shown with giant boobs in a yellow bikini at the beach.<br/><br/>They all go for a hike to a waterfall where Palmer strips down to reveal her insanely hot body. Jen decides to join and takes off her jean shorts and top to reveal an equally as hot body as Palmer. The men are shocked. They lay side by side and they have the same body shape.<br/><br/>The son tells his sister, Dan and Palmer that his dad does not have time for him. Palmer makes arrangements to go to the spa with Jen and Dan goes to take fake happy photos with the kids. He teaches the boy how to swim and the women join them in cheering later.<br/><br/>Danny and Palmer are in their room. Palmer is in a towel as Dan is on the phone with Jen. She takes off her towel and Dan tells Jen he is not going to dinner with her college friend. Palmer goes into the shower where N'Sync is playing. Dan opens the shower door to hand the phone to Palmer.<br/><br/>Jen meets her college friend and her friend's husband for dinner with Danny.<br/><br/>This college friend is very mushy with her husband and they tell each other what they love about the other whenever they have to be apart. Jen and Dan are egged on to do it too after and this scene is so romantic and genuine. They have to look into each other's eyes.<br/><br/>There is a dancing contest and Jen comes out in a coconut bra. They are tied and her college friend insists on a tie-breaker. The couples have to roll up a coconut without touching it to their mouths.<br/><br/>Their extra group member takes Palmer out to a strange place for dinner far away from Jen and Danny as demanded by Jen. He does CPR to a sheep and saves it from choking to death.<br/><br/>Dan and Jen see each other outside their hotel rooms and there are romantic vibes as they admit how much of a good time they are having with the other.<br/><br/>The group members see each other in front of the elevators. Palmer is happy with the family's situation and tells Dan they should marry tomorrow. Jen learns this as she is on the elevator. Dan does not really accept this marriage yet but Palmer does not sense this. The guy faking the accent really does not help and ships Dan and Palmer together.<br/><br/>Palmer goes to look for a wedding dress and Dan calls Jen in the evening asking for her opinion. Jen replies he does not need her permission as he is a big boy.<br/><br/>Palmer and Jen see each other in the lobby and Jen tells Palmer how beautiful she looks in her short wedding dress and flower. Palmer tells Jen she thinks Dan is still in love with her and is unsure of the marriage.<br/><br/>Jen and her college friend are at the bar and Jen admits everything has been a lie. She is single, not rich, working as an assistant. Her friend looks slightly pleased to learn this and surprised. Her college friend admits she is not with her husband anymore as he is gay. Jen asks her why didn't they do this before, just be truthful? Dan shows up right next to Jen to Jen's surprise and asks her about her liking him.<br/><br/>I love Adam Sandler's and Jennifer Aniston's genuine and calm personalities. No one is fake nervous like in other films.<br/><br/>We see Danny and Jen at their wedding and then the credits come on. The instrumental music at the end and throughout the film is beautiful.<br/><br/>There was at least 3 2011 songs in this film."

","Similar flavor to that of 50 First Dates. Jennifer Anniston plays a down to earth mom who gets caught up in her boss's agenda and along with him starts a chain of lies to help him get the girl (Palmer). Palmer lost credibility from the get go during the beach scene when she initially tells Danny ""I can tell when your lying and telling the truth"" and for the remaining hour of the movie buys his lies one right after another. Their adventure in Hawaii is fun, the story line is ""cute"" and the cast together was a really good fit for that sort of movie. Annistons character brought me back to Jennifer Anniston in Office Space. I was pleasantly surprised at the end of the movie. Drew was missed but you'll see the rest of the usual Adam Sandler crew in the movie."
"alindsay-al","4","1","1","5 December 2016"," A below average Comedy that is pretty bland
","I like a good comedy and there is a few big stars in this film so I decided to watch just go with it and this film didn't do much to entertain but it isn't one of the worst comedies I have ever seen. In this film a man lies to his girlfriend that he is a divorced family man so he recruits his assistant and her kids to pose as his family. Adam Sandler has been around for years now and I think he is a talented actor and he actually does provide a bit of depth to his character in this film. You buy the chemistry between him and Jennifer aniston and you do slightly care about it and see his character develop throughout the film. But at times he becomes the Sandler from grown ups with just over the top moments and humour that just doesn't land. Jennifer aniston plays his fake wife and he does a decent job in this film and as mentioned before she works really well with Sandler. Her character was pretty likable even if she was a little cliché. Everybody else in this film is completely worthless and totally unfunny, whether it is Sandler's girlfriend or anistons kids or Nicole Kidman's character who were all incredibly annoying and not worth caring about. This film's story is totally cliché, from the synopsis you can guess the entire plot with no twists at all. But this film has got quite a bit of heart to it and I liked the overall message of this film. The script has some decent drama and humour that will make you chuckle, but there is allot of more cringeworthy dialogue that makes you question if the guys who wrote this film cared at all. The style of the film has been done plenty of times and the humour just doesn't always work and the style of this film feels really cheap and not in the good way. Overall this film is very forgetful and definitely not worth a watch."
"hall895","5","1","1","9 August 2015"," Just not funny enough
","Just Go with It is less juvenile than many of Adam Sandler's previous works. So that's good. But in a movie which unbelievably stretches to almost two hours in length there are very few laughs. That's bad. Sandler, for the most part, acts like an actual grown-up. But this more mature Sandler doesn't turn out to be a funnier one. This is a hit-and-miss comedy in which the misses definitely outnumber the hits.<br/><br/>Sandler plays Danny, a successful, and quite single, Los Angeles plastic surgeon who scores with hot women by using a wedding ring to pretend he's unhappily married. He is quite content with his life of meaningless one-night stands. Then, without his fake ring on, he hooks up with the impossibly hot Palmer. He feels a genuine connection with her. But then she finds the ring, assumes he really is married, and refuses to have anything to do with him. Danny tells her he is about to be divorced, Palmer insists on meeting his supposed wife. Danny concocts a plan, having his office assistant, single mom Katherine, pretend to be his wife. But the plan veers off the rails and Danny ends up having to take the ruse all the way to Hawaii. Danny, Palmer, Katherine and Katherine's kids, who Palmer thinks are also Danny's kids, jet off on their tropical adventure. There's also a very annoying fake boyfriend for Katherine. So much deception. But so few laughs. The setup is seemingly there for some decent screwball comedy. But the movie largely falls flat.<br/><br/>The movie is not a total failure. There are some chuckles here and there but no huge laughs. Certainly not enough consistent comedy to maintain the film over its exorbitantly long running time. Sandler is OK. The real standout is Jennifer Aniston, playing Katherine. Aniston has such great comic instincts and is so incredibly charming. It's a shame she doesn't have better material to work with here. Brooklyn Decker is surprisingly good as Palmer. A swimsuit model by trade Decker certainly fills out a bikini quite well. And in this film the camera lingers over her to the extent drooling may be induced from some members of the audience. But Decker proves to be capable of more than looking hot, she actually shows reasonably decent acting chops. She could have a future in this. Heck, she turns in a much better performance here than Nicole Kidman does. Kidman shows up halfway through the film and you'll wish she hadn't. She mails in a terrible performance and her character brings a bad vibe to the proceedings. She's a villain in a film which didn't need one. Nick Swardson, playing Katherine's fake boyfriend with a fake German accent, is grating to the extreme. And just when you think he can't be any worse he has an excruciatingly unfunny encounter with a sheep. The less said about that the better. The children are rather annoying as well. It's hard to produce a likable comedy when there are so many characters you don't like. Sandler, Aniston and Decker do the best they can but everyone and everything else fails. The comedy never hits it big. The plot fizzles out rather quickly and there's more than a hint of obviousness to it. It's not hard to guess where the story is headed. That wouldn't be so bad if there were a lot of great laughs along the way. But those laughs are not there."
"AvidClimber","6","1","1","3 April 2013"," Just Go with It — A romantic comedy about a well meaning escalation of lies
","Just Go with It is one of those romantic comedy that goes the silly way to try to prove that you need to commit to be happy, with the main character chasing the right girl the wrong way getting deeper and deeper into trouble.<br/><br/>The story is interesting, but it's a standard escalation of lies and attempts to maintain the fiction. The best acting performance is given by Jennifer Aniston. Adam Sandler does himself credit for making us laugh without resorting to his early career antics, but he has done better. Nicole Kidman is not at her best, but I suspect the role and probably the directorial inputs she was given are responsible for the result. The rest of the cast gives us an average performance, just like the movie itself.<br/><br/>It's acceptable entertainment if you like romantic comedy with silly streak. If you're a Aniston or Sandler fan, you should also feel at home. The others should pass."

This he does with the help of his assistant (Jennifer Aniston) and her kids.

","A Hollywood blockbuster rom-com starring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston? Despite the duo's careers it'd be hard not having negative preconceptions about this movie and unfortunately, for the most part, they turned out to be true.<br/><br/>The storyline, as well as the dialogue, are slightly more fresh compared to other films from the same genre, however the turn of events is still easy to predict, apart from what-seems-to-me-as-a-psycho-girlfriend, Palmer, who weirdly enough keeps persisting to engage in all sorts of activities with Danny's (A. Sandler) fake wife and kids without feeling awkward at all in their company. Maybe I was brought up differently to others, but as a viewer I cannot help but to grab my head in disbelief when Palmer (B. Decker) comes up with half the stuff she does and none of the characters ever questions, nor claims it as simply pushing things too far.<br/><br/>With the weird stuff going this film's more of a dramatic comedy, rather than a romantic one, although the chemistry between Danny and Katherine (Aniston) is definitely something to look at. Aniston does a good job of containing Sandler's repetitive humour to a perfect amount, which results in genuine burst-out laughter on a handful of occasions while still maintaining quality jokes throughout the rest of the film.<br/><br/>You can bring your other half to 'Just Go with It' on a boring Tuesday afternoon to the cinema without feeling robbed by the movie industry, however if you're looking for something more in terms of entertainment, humour, etc. this film is not likely to deliver."

","I didn't expect anything good when I heard about this movie. I'm not sure why I allowed myself to be tricked in to watching it. First of all, it was advertised on 2 things. 1: The fact that it's an Adam Sandler movie and he has made funny movies in the past. 2: One shot of the hot woman walking out of the water being shown a million times. We get it she's hot. Are we stupid? Oh my God! I want to see this movie so bad because there's hot chick in it! Give me a break. The child actors in this film were horrible. Which usually goes without saying. But good lord! Then, why is everyone in the movie so stupid? Why do they let these kids walk all over them. You take them aside and tell them to stop being little ass holes. Hell, hit them I don't care. I would say the only saving grace of this film is Nick Swardson. He is always pretty funny. But he doesn't have much to do in this movie. Slap stick is getting old. I'm pretty sure modern audiences who are over 12 or have half a brain don't think some one running into something or falling down and going boom is funny."
"KineticSeoul","Null","4","9","15 July 2011"," I couldn't just go with it
","This movie turned out to be way lower than my expectation and I had a very low expectation for this movie. It was just so darn dull, lame and downright predictable. If you seen the trailer, you can basically summarize EXACTLY what this movie is about and the direction it's going to take and how it's going to end. I liked Adam Sandler movies in the past, mainly during my childhood. But it seems he isn't even trying anymore at all. He plays basically the same character in every movie, it also seems he is trying a bit too hard to make himself likable and cool for the majority of the audiences. Which is fine, but he plays the similar smart ass that sometimes makes witty remarks that bash on idiots while he also has a bit of anger issues and he is always good with kids. That is basically the same formula he goes with in this movie as well, it's like he didn't even clearly read the script and just did it for the paycheck. This movie also seemed way longer than it's running time, I was actually constantly checking the time to make sure when it will end cause the running time felt like it was going so darn slow. The jokes are just plain lame in this movie and I didn't even get a single chuckle out of this movie and most definitely didn't laugh at all. I just can't see how anyone would really enjoy this movie. There is way better comedies out there, some even that features Adam Sandler in the past. Just go see that instead of wasting time with this crap.<br/><br/>2.8/10"

","This film is about a plastic surgeon who lies about being almost divorced in order to hook up with women.

There is amazing connection between Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston, which is critical for the film's success. There are so many funny scenes, I laughed so hard at a few of them, such as Palmer being pushed into the pool and the coconut scene. Nicole Kidman has a small but memorable role, which sees her in situations (involving the coconut as well) which I would not have imagined a mega star to agree to filming.

"johnnyfry2","9","4","9","13 March 2011"," I rarely give a comedy such a high rating...
","I have always enjoyed comedies, but I have seen so few truly funny movies of late. Today's funny movies generally consist of over-vulgar language and humiliation, this movie was not like this. 9 out of 10 stars from me, as it delivered more than I expected, and from top to bottom it was a funny and enjoyable film on many fronts.<br/><br/>First of all I will say this, if this was a supposed romantic-comedy it was far more weighted on the comedy than the romance, which is important to know if you are like me and not a fan of romantic-comedies in general. I was worried that this movie would be heavy on the romance, which almost always turns a potentially good comedy into something cheesy. I want to see such movies to laugh, not for the watered down romance storyline; this movie didn't go down that forgettable route as so many other potentially funny movies have. <br/><br/>On this note, there is some romance, but even though you knew where it was going at some point, it remained fresh and even hilarious at times, as the jokes kept coming and there wasn't a 30 minute lull in the movie to fulfill the mandatory boy-meets-girl part of the script.<br/><br/>Everyone in the movie did an exceptional job acting, including the kids in the film, and some actors took some risks for the sake of being funny (i.e when Aniston in a bikini, Aniston and Kidman entering the dance contest etc). It was particularly enjoyable to see that the actors didn't take themselves seriously in the role, but they did take their acting seriously. Often times I watch a comedy and cringe at the weak commitment to the film, this was not the case here as they all seemed more natural and free flowing, getting full value out of the dialogue.<br/><br/>As has been mentioned on here, Nick Swardson seemed to take the reigns with being the central comic-relief character, relying on his antics to get the laughs, and for my money he succeeded.<br/><br/>There were about 3-4 scenes in which I absolutely lost myself in the theatre and everyone else was laughing just the same. If this is any indication of a good comedy, than this movie over exceeded expectations."

Out of the cast, only Aniston impresses with decent comic timing, with many others simply making fools of themselves or proving that their talents should stay on swimsuit calenders rather than the movie screen. Dave Matthews turns up for an unknown reason, as does Kidman (slumming it but apparently having fun) and some Police songs are bastardised into remixes, although despite the painful mugging there are a couple of more subtle visual jokes that suggest the filmmakers do actually have some knowledge of cinema history, including a La Dolce Vita waterfall shot."

","¨Feels good being honest, doesn't it? Were you telling the truth when  you said you might be in love with me? ¨  It actually feels good being honest; unfortunately there is nothing  honest about this romantic comedy. The movie is just one big lie after  another and I simply couldn't just go along with it. It made no sense  at all and at the same time a five year old could know where this movie  was heading from the opening credits. The jokes and gags have been told  before by Adam Sandler himself and repeated over and over again in his  movies. It was funny in his early Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore days,  but listening to the same joke repeated time after time again is simply  not funny anymore. As for the romance, if you've ever seen a chic flick  you've also seen Just Go With It and it's clichés. Dennis Dugan has  directed Adam Sandler at least half a dozen times before and they seem  to be making the same movie over and over again. I don't blame them:  their films make money in the box office and they seem to be having a  lot of fun at work because they don't even have to try to make a good  film because audiences simply are willing to just go with it. If you  are the type of viewer who doesn't really care too much about  originality, good acting, or good scripts, then you probably will have  a good time just going with it, but I guarantee you will forget you  even saw it the next day. This movie was just so predictable from the  very beginning to the very end that I simply couldn't just go with it.  This time around Adam Sandler is Danny, a plastic surgeon and a player  with the ladies. His heart was broken several years ago on his wedding  night, but he also learned an important lesson on how to get girls to  fall for him. He keeps the ring and tells the girls he is married, but  is going through a rough time. Apparently they all seem to have a  weakness for broken hearted and committed men so he gets what he wants:  a one night stand and no relationships. The only person who he is  really honest to is his assistant, Katherine (Jennifer Aniston), who  somehow finds his ¨romantic stories¨ amusing. She is a single loving  mother of two children: Maggie (Bailee Madison) and Michael (Griffin  Gluck). The player finally ends up falling in love with a gorgeous and  much younger woman named Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) who is a sweet math  teacher. Danny never actually plays the married card with her, but the  next morning she discovers the ring in Danny's pocket and is upset that  she has slept with a married man. Her parents got divorced and she had  promised herself she would never wreck a marriage. Danny really likes  this girl so he does the only thing he really knows how to do which is  to lie. He says that he is getting divorced, that his wife cheated on  him, but Palmer won't believe him until she hears it from his soon to  be ex-wife. Danny asks Katherine to act as her, but through a mix up  her kids also get involved and now Palmer wants to spend time with the  kids so they all travel together to Hawaii and the lies begin to build.  Adam Sandler always finds the best locations to make his movies. He  really makes sure he is going to have a fun time while filming. I don't  blame him; he is a great comedian and really doesn't have to try too  hard. He has proved he can act in dramatic roles as well like Drunk  Punch Love or Reign Over Me, but those great movies simply don't get  that much recognition or bring in huge box office numbers, so why  stress out when audiences continue to go with his light comedies?  Jennifer Aniston is a great actress, and she was alright in this movie.  Brooklyn Decker might be beautiful, but she isn't a good actress. My  favorite performance came from Bailee Madison; the girl has a lot of  charisma and she delivered the most laughs in my opinion. Nicole Kidman  and Dave Matthews play secondary characters and they share some  moments, but the script really didn't help anyone out that much. Nick  Swardson played the role of the dumb and obsessed with girls' character  that always shows up in an Adam Sandler film. His sole purpose in the  movie is just to be ridiculous. I didn't find him funny at all. I  really don't understand how Sandler's character was planning on having  a long relationship with this girl with all these lies he was telling  her. How does a loving mother go along by dragging her kids into this  mess? I mean the kids weren't going to disappear after the ¨family  vacation, ¨ but I guess it really didn't matter because we knew exactly  what direction the movie was going to go anyway. All we had to do was  sit down, leave our brains at home, and just go with it."

The one lady who has remained constant in his life is his personal assistant, Katherine (Jennifer Anniston). She supports him at work and with every trouble. However, she is a divorcée with two children to support so she is in search of a ""good man"" herself. One day, Danny meets the young woman of his dreams, Palmer (Brooklyn Decker), a caring teacher 15 years his junior. But, after a night on the beach, she finds his wedding ring in his pocket and assumes he is a lying you-know-what. To make her realize he IS married and that he and his wife are having problems, he asks Katherine to ""pretend"" to be his married partner and have a lunch between the three of them, so Palmer can verify that it is ""over"". But, naturally, a more complicated web springs forth, for Kate has to take a call from one of her kids at the end of the meal and now Palmer knows there are children involved. Soon, Danny has to arrange a meeting with Kate's whole family, but, the doctor has to bribe the kids into making it look real. Before long, everyone is off to Hawaii for a vacation, where Kate runs into an old back-stabbing sorority gal, Devlin (Nicole Kidman). So, now Kate ""pretends"" that Danny is HER husband, so Devlin, married to a phone inventor, can see that a plastic surgeon is good fishing, too. When will the secrets tumble out and, could it be, that Danny may be developing an interest in Kate, much to his surprise? This very loose adaptation of Cactus Flower is a charmer. There are many funny lines and the cast is great, with the main principals and supporting actors doing fine work. No, Sandler is not a cookie cutter romantic lead but he is man of many talents, no doubt. Also, the scenery is wonderful, as are the costumes, with Aniston looking so good, you want to check her driver's license. Ditto for Kidman. The photography, script and direction are more than winning as well. If you are looking for a new romantic comedy, don't shy away from this one, you will be entertained. On the other hand, if you are a Sandler aficianado, you will find it right up your alley, too."
"Marvelouis","7","3","6","17 February 2011"," Perfect Embodiment of a NICE Movie
","Adam Sandler's last few movie efforts were a tough way to spend a couple of hours. This is the exact opposite, delivering quite a few pleasant and amusing moments. I'd call this film the perfect embodiment of a ""nice"" movie. Nothing extraordinary or laugh out loud funny but the number of chuckles and amusing situations do add up. It has heart and characters that are genuine and likable. Sure, some of the decisions Sandler's character makes defy logic and even common sense but who goes to his films seeking reason and logic? Sitcom type situations hammered in to the film somehow works with this cast. The one level where the film operates above the ""nice"" or average range is on the superficial but enjoyable girl watching level. Yes, film fans often rave about breathtaking cinematography but I can't say I've seen any sunset or landscape shot that rivals the shear beauty of watching Brooklyn Decker glide across screen in slow motion. Add Jennifer Aniston in various tight outfits and in a ""Hula-off"" with Nicole Kidman and the babe factor is as elevated as can be. Again, an enjoyable way to spend a few hours."

Adam and Jennifer had a great connection and the movie offered lots of funny moments. I regretted taking my 12 yr. old granddaughter, as they were too many sexual comments. I had never taken her to a PG-13 movie, and will never again until she is much older. I was glad she was uninterested and was busy sending text messages to her girlfriend, rather than watching the movie. She only watches Disney, and the like, but since she was visiting at our house, we let her go. Big mistake. I had her Dad pick her up before the movie was over. Nonetheless, my husband and I enjoyed the movie, and recommend it if you like romance and comedy. I was surprised at the low ratings it got from women 45 and older."
"reelcouples","1","4","10","18 March 2011"," Terrible movie, but the couple has potential
","Oy.<br/><br/>This movie left us wishing we had Just Gone to see something else. We can't decide which was more painful - sitting through it or having to relive it again by writing about it.<br/><br/>Twenty years ago Danny Maccabee was a sad-sack cardiologist-in-training with a giant honker. Upon overhearing that his bride-to-be has no intention of being faithful to him, he skips out on his wedding and heads to the local bar where a random hottie takes pity on him and inexplicably takes him home for the night. Discovering that a wedding ring, a tale of woe and a nose job are all he needs to get laid, Danny spends the next 20 years seducing barely legal women with tales of the brutality that his imaginary wife inflicts on him. When he's not out inflating his ego in bars he's over-inflating bosoms at his plastic surgery practice in LA. His office manager Katherine, a smart, dependable, single mom, is the one true friend that he seems to have.<br/><br/>And then one night he meets Palmer, a 26-year-old blondeshell that - amazingly - has a body AND brains! She's not just some dime-a-dozen LA actress - she's a school teacher, a shaper of young minds. Somehow it takes just one night of sex on the beach for Danny and Palmer to believe that they are a perfect match for each other.<br/><br/>Alas - true love is not without its pitfalls. When Palmer discovers Danny's fake wedding ring she furiously assumes he's married. Rather than horrify her with tales of his faux-play, Danny tells her he's married but already in the process of getting a divorce. Somewhat lulled by this first lie, Palmer insists that she meet the wife. Panicked at the thought of being caught out Danny somehow convinces Katherine to portray his future ex for what should be a one-time-only meeting, but an unexpected phone call from Katherine's daughter leads Palmer to believe that Danny is a father as well as a husband. The rest of the lies unfurl like a line of dominoes from there: His ex-wife's name is Devlin. His daughter went to boarding school in the UK. Devlin has a German lover named Dolph Lundgren. And somehow all of these lies culminate in the entire group - Danny, Devlin, Palmer, Dolph and the kids - heading to Hawaii together. And at some point during all this chaos Danny realizes that it's Katherine he loves, not Palmer.<br/><br/>We know our job here is to rate the couple and we promise we'll get to them in a minute. But first we need to vent a bit more at the complete implausibility of this entire plot line. We know it's the movies and we're always willing to suspend a little disbelief. But the amount of disbelief here went way beyond the load limit of our suspension cables. One more thing and they'd have snapped. The list of predicaments these characters found themselves in were so contrived they literally had us covering our eyes.<br/><br/>Is it just us? Have we lost our sense of fun along with our sense of romance? The characters themselves were inconsistent and hard to warm up to. Danny is presumably supposed to be boyishly charming and he has some decent moments, but he dresses like a slob no matter what the occasion, treats Katherine's kids badly and uses cringe-inducing terms like ""I want to climb Palmer Mountain."" As for Palmer, underneath all the packaging she is supposed to be a smart genuine person yet she falls for every outlandish lie she's told and confesses that her most painful moment was the disbanding of NSync 10 years ago. We couldn't find any basis for their relationship from either his perspective or hers, and certainly nothing to justify her traveling to Hawaii with his family or his bringing her. As for the rest of the gang - Danny's best male friend Eddie (aka Dolph) is a sophomoric moron, and Katherine's daughter Maggie is one of the most annoyingly precocious children ever to grace the screen. Katherine is the only likable character in the film.<br/><br/>With that said...<br/><br/>We actually do see some possibilities here for Katherine and Danny. Once again we have two friends that have known each other forever, that care about each other, and that can be themselves with each other. It takes a while for them to recognize their mutual attraction, and the fact that it requires Katherine to first have a complete overhaul makes us wonder if Danny will ever be anything more than an aging, superficial douche. Plus we are less than impressed with his treatment of her kids - we thought Michael's breakdown over his real father's neglect would be Danny's time to shine but instead he behaved even more appallingly than ever. That's not the kind of behavior that a lifelong bachelor is suddenly going to reform.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the two seem like they can be a fit, and both seemed genuinely happy at their wedding. They work and banter well together - the scenes between the two of them were the best of the film. If Danny can grow up a little and be the husband and father that Katherine and her children (well one of them) deserve, mazel tov. Otherwise it won't be long before she's asking him to Just Go.<br/><br/>www.reel-couples.com"

","Sandler and company go back to the well that gave us all '50 First Dates', a quirky and funny Rom-Com.

But sadly, this plot which was old enough to make the Bible look fresh, was so painfully obvious from the first 5 minutes, they didn't even hide the ""spoiler"" from the poster itself. They had THAT much faith in their project that they said, ""Okay, we know you're not all that stupid, despite the fact you chose an Adam Sandler film for entertainment, so why don't we just get it all over with the poster."" The movie was painful at times – Sandler playing his typical RICH Doofus only he went beyond slapstickish as being the worst doctor in movie history – but it was just a ruse to get the two real loves together. Obviously. Look, I would've appreciated it tenfold if the unpredicted wedding took place in the finale instead of what we all know what's coming. Oh, and lest we forget, despite Dr. Sandler having unfunny pokes with his assistant at patients, he's also an ass who uses, abuses and LIES to women for 20 years. Why, again, are we supposed to root for this guy? Even Jennifer Aniston knows this about him oh, wait, she's had experience in that field"

"napierslogs","7","3","7","13 June 2011"," Not a good romantic comedy, but it is funny and romantic
","""Just Go with It"" has Adam Sandler trying his hand at his ladies man shtick rather than his immature man-child routine. The result is a somewhat mature (not to be confused with intelligent) romantic comedy, rather than a zany screwball comedy. I like most romantic comedies no matter how pedantic and unoriginal they may be as long as they are funny and romantic too. And this one is all of the above.<br/><br/>Danny (Adam Sandler) has long since discovered that a wedding ring and a sob story can go a long way towards picking up women. But then he meets Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) and she's supposed to be different. We can't actually tell why she's more special than the others, they just have to tell us that since subtlety is not a strong point here. The best part about Decker, the 20-something model, is that she gets showed up by Jennifer Aniston, who in turn, gets half-showed up by Nicole Kidman. There's something almost poetic about Hollywood's universe inadvertently becoming backwards.<br/><br/>""Just Go with It"" is as predictable as they get and far from original but it kept me amused and Sandler's light humour kept me smiling. It certainly isn't a good romantic comedy (which, believe it or not, does exist), but it was exactly as I expected it to be. I enjoyed it, but then again I like Jennifer Aniston and I think Adam Sandler is funny."

In order to salvage his relationship, he recruits his assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend to be his wife, and soon to be his ex.<br/><br/>This is a remake of Cactus Flower (1969). Adam Sandler comes off more of a douche than the original. The original was already douchy but that was another era. His womanizing scheme is disgusting which makes Danny a douche. The reason for the scheme is to avoid these single women who are all desperate to get married. Times have changed. The original lie to Palmer is unreasonable and really distracting. The whole thing starts off horribly. Brooklyn Decker is surprisingly good for a model turn actress. Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler have some good vicious dialog exchanges together.

"Robert_duder","7","2","4","20 August 2011"," Cool little romance flick, cute, and light
","Adam Sandler comedies are very hit and miss. Click, The Wedding Singer...true brilliance. Big Daddy, his early work like Happy Gilmore, Zoltan...I could go on...utter crap. Now we have this light hearted, cute, funny little comedy Just Go With It. It is somewhere in the middle of some of his previous work. It definitely has its fair share of knee slapping comedy, but is also very predictable and run of the mill which isn't necessarily a fault but it also doesn't make the film stand out in a sea of other romantic films. It does make a great date movie and I think gals will probably enjoy the film more than guys. One of the truly great things about the film are the young stars that play the kids in the film. They have some of the best comedic scenes.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is...well Adam Sandler...nothing new here. He plays rich and womanizing Danny. In a lot of ways his character is sort of unlikable but then at the same time you sort of feel sorry for the guy and he's kind of a down to earth regular guy which Sandler does well at. Hollywood star Jennifer Aniston plays Katherine, Sandler's best friend and office manager. You wouldn't normally expect chemistry between Aniston and Sandler but they are actually pretty decent. They have good comedic timing together and good chemistry. Aniston is impeccably sweet as usual, and she does romantic comedy very well. Brooklyn Decker plays Palmer, the voluptuous, if not slightly vapid object of Sandler's affections. Decker is decent in her role, certainly plays the eye candy role well. This is really her feature film debut and she is decent at it! Probably above average for a model turned actress. Bailee Madison is one of the youngsters I mentioned previously that plays Aniston's children. Madison is truly outstanding and hilarious in her role. This ten year old girl has over a dozen credits to her name and her talent shines through even in this role. Griffin Gluck also does well as the little brother. Madison definitely outshines Gluck but he is still really good too and has some very solid moments in the film. Nick Swardson is silly and annoying as Sandler's cousin. He is usually silly and annoying but it doesn't fit this film when its almost trying to be a serious romantic comedy. Nicole Kidman makes a cameo performance as Aniston's college nemesis Devlin Adams. Considering her role is significantly small she does a great job.<br/><br/>Dennis Dugan is the director for this film...not a surprise given he's been riding the Sandler train for years. Dugan is a director that clearly likes slapstick comedy more than telling a story. He has directed some of Sandler's worst comedies including the aforementioned Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy, as well as Zoltan, Chuck and Larry and Grown Ups. He just seems to churn these films out and wants to have a good time instead of making sure he's making a good movie. Just Go With It is a decent film because of the cast and the cute story but it certainly isn't top notch. Its light and fluffy and silly and I just wanted more from it I suppose. I know Sandler is capable, I know Aniston is capable but it does entertain. It isn't legendary comedy or romance but its worth a Saturday night movie night. 7/10"

","I am not a huge Adam Sandler fan but I enjoyed this one mainly because the screenplay is good and it doesn't rely too much on Sandler. The other cast members provide most of the funny lines. Jennnifer is quite attractive even next to the much younger Brooklyn Decker who incidentally is quite an adequate actress. The cute little girl Bailee Madison is a charming scene stealer her accent is much better than Selena Gomez in Monte Carlo (for anyone who has seen the disappointing Monte Carlo). The story is pleasant and funny without being obvious or corny or cringe inducing. There are many laugh out loud moments and most characters are likable except Eddie played by Nick Swardson who is a little annoying. Overall enjoyable and worth watching."

","Pretty bad approach for educated professionals, Adam Sandler is well-off L.A. plastic surgeon Danny Maccabee who almost got married when he was young, and didn't, but kept wearing the wedding band. He found that it helped him have a series of short-term relationships and one-night stands, well into his 40s. <br/><br/>But then he meets someone that really rings his bell, it is love at first sight, and for the first time in his adult life wants this relationship to work long-term. It is Andy Roddick's real-life wife, 20-something Brooklyn Decker as Palmer. But when Palmer sees his ring, instead of telling the truth, and this is where the ""bad approach"" comes in, he tells her he is married but about to divorce. He has his assistant, Jennifer Aniston as Katherine, pretend to be his wife, and pretend her name is Devlin. Who also happens to have 2 kids.<br/><br/>All this sets up a series of bargains and bribes to Katherine and the kids, Danny seems willing to spend any amount of money on the ruse, to keep Palmer in his good graces. And this has them end up in Hawaii where the real Devlin from Kathernie's past, Nicole Kidman as Devlin Adams, creates a series of additional ruses. <br/><br/>The whole escapade in Hawaii walks the fine line between being a totally stupid slapstick, and a fairly entertaining story. Fortunately it is closer to the latter, and we found ourselves laughing quite often.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: This kind of comedy usually has antagonists ending up together and that is what happens. Danny and Katherine finally realize that they love each other and just when Danny has successfully snared Palmer, he abandons the wedding and goes to Katherine, they kiss, and are destined to end up happily ever after."

","I watched this movie for the lead actors. Suffice it to say, I was a little disappointed in the end because the movie wasn't as good as I expected it to be. It was slapstick comedy at best, with a lot of the jokes being too crude for my taste. The overall plot though was a comedy of errors and was reasonably funny, although at times, it went a little overboard. It also seemed like Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston were trying too hard. Having already proved their natural flair for comedy, and great comic timing, it seemed like the lead actors were putting in a lot of effort to come off as funny. That was a tad upsetting. I did like Sandler and Aniston's chemistry though. The supporting cast was also decent. The light nature of the movie and the humorous undertones were good enough to warrant a watch, but I probably wouldn't watch it again."

","Like most sit-coms the movie slips from possible to improbable to very improbable. Adam Sandler plays Danny, who is about to be married. He discovers his bride to be had a fling with her former bf right before the wedding and she is just marrying him for his money. Danny is depressed as he sits in a bar with his wedding ring on. He discovers the ring is a chick magnet that leads to numerous one night stands. He calls it ""my precious."" Jennifer Anniston plays his single receptionist with 2 children. At a party, Danny meets a Barbie Doll school teacher and has a great night. He wasn't wearing his ring, but then she discovers it! You cad! Danny eventually explains he is getting divorced and she insists upon meeting the soon to be ex-wife. Rather than level with her, he asks Jennifer to play the role of his ex-wife which includes make-over and clothes perks. The meeting goes well as Anniston plays the jilted wife...then her cell phone rings. It is her kids, which must be Danny's kids too, right? Barbie Doll, a teacher loves kids and wants to meet Danny's kids. Now Danny must bribe Anniston's kids to pretend to be his kids. Oh what a tangle web we weave...<br/><br/>The movie contains humor about bad plastic surgery plus some toilet humor. It has some good rock tunes, especially as swagger music. When Anniston starts dating a man in another office, Danny shows some signs of jealousy. One lie leads to another and then to another. Predictable and fun, A feel good film of the chick flick variety. <br/><br/>No sex or nudity. Nice bikini shots. Some crude suggestive sex talk, although nothing as what we have been getting from Hollywood."

But then again, since you've come to Hot Toasty Rag to read my review, I'll have to come up with something.<br/><br/>If you read the plot synopsis, it doesn't seem that bad. A man pretends he's a family man to avoid getting romantic commitments, but when he starts to fall in love, he has to put his money where his mouth is and come up with a family. Then the movie starts. And you soon wish it hadn't.<br/><br/>I don't know if Jennifer Aniston signed a terrible contract, or if she just has lousy taste in scripts, but if she doesn't make a good movie after this one, her career might come to a screeching halt. The entire movie feels like Adam Sandler did nothing but repeat the title to his cast before every take, encouraging them to improv the most unfunny, unlikable characters in history. This movie is so terrible, it's an insult to place it among actual palatable films in the category of romantic comedies.<br/><br/>I've previously revealed that I'll watch every Jennifer Aniston movie in the world; she is my ""It girl"" and my teenage idol. That being said, I didn't make it all the way through this movie. This is the only Jennifer Aniston movie I've ever turned off. That should be a big enough ""Keep Out"" sign for you to see."

","Just go with it starring Jennifer Aniston and Adam sandler really is better than I expected. Jennifer Aniston is charming and funny as ever, she and Sandler have surprisingly good chemistry. Some of the script and dialogue really is funny, which is another surprising part, considering that Sandler films aren't usually my cup of tea, just take mr deeds for example, how the hell does that movie have a higher rotten tomatoes rating that just go with it? Like seriously I wanna know. But anyways, the comedy is good and Brooklyn Decker is good too, she wasn't just a hot body, don't get me wrong plenty of the comments are made about that, but she brings more to the character than that. I loved Nicole Kidman as Devlin Adams, she plays her character very very well. Also, I loved the pretty scenery, and the environment of the movie. I liked the ending too, maybe a tad cliché, but it's cute nonetheless. Just go with it gets a big 8/10 overall."

Starring Bollywood superstar Salman khan , Katrina Kaif and former Miss World Susmita Sen. The Bollywood version was funnier but this is more acceptable or realistic. In a script where little chance of acting provided, Jenifer Anistone shone brightly. Nicole Kidman cameo brought a fresh air. Otherwise supporting roles were not up to the mark.

"viennashade","8","0","0","8 September 2015"," Crudely Charming
","Silly and juvenile is not really my type of humor, but I loved it anyway. If it wasn't enough that the whole plot premise was far-fetched, they had to throw in a bunch of ludicrous situations and ridiculous dialogue. Still, it wasn't as silly and juvenile as you would expect for a Sandler film.<br/><br/>I tend to eventually see everything Jennifer Aniston does – I suppose because I keep wanting to see her prove wrong the naysayers who claim she always plays the same character. And in this I thought she was terrific. She was the rock – the voice of reason, and independent. Not just some breezy shallow character.<br/><br/>In The Switch, much as I like Jason Bateman, the chemistry just wasn't there. And in The Bounty Hunter Aniston seemed way too focused on trying to look hot rather than her acting. But here her acting was solid and the chemistry good.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching Sandler do some acting rather than only his usual zaniness. I actually thought he was great in this.<br/><br/>Even Brooke, who I was sure I would hate, did a decent job. Nicole not so much - maybe she hasn't yet conquered comedy, but it was excellent to see her not taking herself too seriously. That's an example, I think, of an actress doing something not for the money. And the kids were not bad. I could have done without the Eddie character altogether. Just too over the top.<br/><br/>All too often lately I see movies where 2 people fall in love and it doesn't make sense -- you can understand why the one person loves the other, but not vice versa. In Just Go With It, though, both of these characters were likable and deserving, and you wanted them to get together. Just as Devlin says, these 2 had an obvious connection. There was a kind of electricity, and a tenderness.<br/><br/>Although Sandler doesn't have any writing credits, I get the feeling half of this was improv. I haven't seen the stories it was based on, but I imagine it is far removed from either of them.<br/><br/>I don't recall laughing out loud a whole lot, but I definitely was smiley and happy throughout the whole thing. at the end I was literally clapping.<br/><br/>All in all, a good time. I don't usually watch a movie more than once, but I've already seen all of this at least twice, and a few of the scenes I wanted to watch over and over, hence the high score."

","Welcome, everyone, to Final Jeopardy! Let's check the category - Unforgettable Sandman. Okay, great dude. And the answer is...this is the plot for 2011's Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston hit romantic-comedy, Just Go With It. Dooo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Okay now put down your magic computer screen markers and let's see your answers, contestant number 1. 'Where is or what is, uh, like a plastic surgeon wants to meet a girl or take his girlfriend on a vacation so he creates up a fake family with two kids and a wife but he and the wife are actually divorced and they used to be married or maybe not. I don't know, dude. You tell me Alex!' Oh, I'm sorry, the correct answer is what is nobody knows. Nobody knows. We also would have accepted nobody cares and I don't know, I've never seen it. And how much did u wager? 2 hours on a Saturday? You LOOOSSSSE!<br/><br/>Just kidding. Whatever. I really love this movie. Just Go With It is 1 of my favorite comedies. It is! I love it! Just Go With It is the most extraordinary genius comedic script released in the last 200 years. Charlie Chaplin, eat your heart out! Just kidding, dude. The plot line of Just Go With It is so poignant, identifiable and established that I think that I might pass out right now just talking about it. It's 40 minutes later, I did pass out, I'm drooling on my keyboard, I feel hungry for some crackerjacks, and I think maybe I've come to my senses a bit. Maybe this isn't the best comedy script since 1815, I don't know, dude. Who am I to judge? But I do know one thing...the Sandman has done it again! Way to go, dude! You goofy and adorable dude, you. This movie is great with a lowercase g. Get it? Whatever. Who's hotter? - Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Aniston or Brooklyn Decker? Dooo doo doo doo doo. Jennifer Aniston, I say. But I'm only saying that to make Nicole jealous. It's actually Brooklyn Decker...whatever, dude. Brooklyn has way less baggage than the other two. Brooklyn Decker is really comfortable on screen with these big stars and she does a really good job for a super sexy SI swimsuit cover model. A pair of her best credentials are most directly visible when Brooklyn is coming out of the sunny Hawaiian ocean in that humongous yellow bikini in slow-mo. Is that the right size, Brooklyn? She would probably know better than I, but I would think you would sink like a stone wearing sail flaps like that when swimming. I don't know, dude, whatever. Jennifer Aniston looks real sexy in this movie, and I think right now I'm trying to hide the fact that I am madly in love with Jennifer, dude. I love you, Jennifer Aniston. Whatever. Jennifer looks incredible with a lowercase i when she gets undressed to go swimming in that beautiful lagoon in that little pink bikini. How very flattering. What a hot ass. I mean, Jennifer...okay, I mean Jennifer's ass. She always is good for a chubby in that bikini scene. It's magical. Jennifer looks so hot in that bikini, I'm drooling on my keyboard once again. She definitely has a way hotter body than Brooklyn. That two-piece fits you well, Jenn. Is this in slow-mo or not? Yes. Nicole Kidman is really funny as Devlin and she's really funny in real life too. Lol! Can I just say, Nicole is beautiful. There's your competition, Jenn. Nicole nearly steals the show and she wins audiences over when she flashes her booty for a brief second in the epic Hawaiian coconut dance-off. What a fine slow-mo moment that is.<br/><br/>These 3 girls are so hot, Adam Sandler can just show up to the set, make some stuff up on the spot, and just go with it. Is that what happened? I hope so. The sexy nature of Just Go With It is great, and it all could have been even sexier with longer lasting stills on Jenn, Brooklyn and Nicole when they are being sexy in their scenes, those moments are a bit too fleeting, and way more sex appeal from the Sandman, for the ladies of course, and the fellas as well of course, and maybe even a plot, too! This plot is so random and whatever that it actually works out because the characters seem way more natural like their not even in a movie thanks to the performances from these dudes. That's a good thing! I do love this romantic-comedy, it's hilarious. I laughed out loud so many times, or zero times, I don't know, dude. I'm not a laugh counter. Who is? Just kidding, dude, whatever. But what I do know is Just Go With It is a really funny, and good comedy. It's really funny. Whatever. I have no more to say, except I love you, Sandman, and Jennifer Aniston. Dude."

Nicole Kidman, in a small part still looks like a Botox junkie. She was once so gorgeous. Now, I suppose that she has met her goal, inasmuch as she definitely looks young, just not very pretty.

","I like how the story really puts the background so very nicely for why Danny does what he does every Friday or Saturday night. From then, the story seems to flow so naturally because it already has a solid footing from its background. The jokes are of a mixed overall for me. Some of the jokes are very enjoyably hilarious while the rest are just plain and simple and lame. Having seen Blended (2014) before seeing this movie, I think that it's getting to be a habit for Adam Sandler to star or even produce a family themed movies such as this one, although not really family oriented, mind you. It's with Aniston in Hawaii here, and next it's with Barrymore in Africa. On the acting side, Adam Sandler did a very natural, right at home feel with his role here. He does kind of specialize in comedies like this one, especially in these recent years. Jennifer Aniston played her role just a bit above an okay performance, balancing just enough for the story to have a full angle. I like Nicole Kidman's part here because this proves that she can really play any genre you throw at her."

In fact if you follow romantic comedies closely you will have guessed the end not very long into the movie at all but it doesn't spoil the journey in the least.<br/><br/>The back story opening is not especially well done although it serves the purpose of dishing up the reason why Dr Macabee (Sandler) wears a wedding ring. From there the plot clumsily lunges into the smoother tale as to why wearing a wedding ring when he is not married inevitably eventually leads to trouble. Sandler is his usual self, Anniston is as good as I have seen her in a movie, and Kidman has a minor riot with a wonderfully flawed character.<br/><br/>If you like romantic comedies it will not disappoint you but there are better choices elsewhere."
"PhantomAgony","Null","3","8","7 March 2011"," Formulaic Rom Com with Over the Top Jokes
","Within 10 minutes of viewing, it became clear that 'Just Go With It' would be a formulaic, see the ending coming a mile away romantic comedy which is not my type of movie. It was obvious where the script and in turn, characters, were heading as everyone went through the motions to fulfill the nearly 2 hour movie time. <br/><br/>I was open minded once the romantic comedy by numbers format became evident since the trailers/previews advertised what looked like a hysterical, fun film and figured if anything, I'd get a few good laughs out of the experience. However, in the end, the movie was more ridiculous than funny, the usual awkward boy/girl romantic scenes at the end in a rom com were hard to sit through and I found myself questioning the mental capacity of Brooklyn Decker's character, Palmer. <br/><br/>Sandler plays a plastic surgeon named Danny who meets and likes a much younger woman (23) named Palmer (Decker) at a party and after spending a romantic night on the beach with her, she finds a wedding ring in his pocket. While not married, Danny carries one around as a way to attract women with sob stories of a an abusive/drunk/pill popping/tumultuous wife and horrible home life which seems to work. He had become bitter about love after having a bad experience 20 years earlier with his to be first wife who in the end, he didn't end up marrying. Rather than reveal his trick to Palmer, he tells her that he's married but getting divorced and Palmer decides that she needs to meet his wife to see for herself. Enter Katherine, played by Jennifer Aniston who is playing the same person she plays in basically every movie, who plays Sandler's homely assistant/office manager at his plastic surgery practice. She is a divorced single mother of two who, after some convincing, agrees to play his wife. Cue a makeover to create the illusion of a wealthy plastic surgeon's wife where Aniston suddenly goes from drab to fab (cliche much?) & the subsequent meeting between Danny/Katherine/Palmer. All is going well until Katherine gets a phone call regarding her children which Palmer overhears and now there is a whole fake family of Danny/Katherine + her 2 kids which they tell Palmer, of course are his children. Add in fake names for the kids and bribes to get them to play along and you have a comedy.. I guess.<br/><br/>The majority of the movie takes place in Hawaii - a trip that is taken by Danny/Katherine/the 2 children/Palmer and Danny's cousin Eddie (Nick Swardson), who has a crush on Katherine and makes himself apart of the picture but telling Palmer that he's Katherine's new boyfriend - and of course Katherine has to play along even though she can't stand Eddie.<br/><br/>The lies start out small and then spiral out of control with people clearly coming up with outlandish things on the fly, shocked reactions from the others and then a quick cover and build onto the fake story. It was OBVIOUS that these people were lying and just coming up with random things as they went along yet Palmer bought it all which, for me, just became too ridiculous to believe as the movie went on. It actually became frustrating watching her observe these clearly fake performances and outlandish accents (the daughter played by Bailee Madison and Danny's cousin, Eddie, both speak with over the top faux accents) and cover stories and seemingly buy it all for a good portion of the film. Palmer is supposed to be a smart, competent school teacher yet she was as gullible as a 5 year old and lacked the common sense of an 8 year old. Just too muchway too much and can I just say that the character of Eddie was so unfunny that it was uncomfortable to watch? I usually love Swardson in movies but the whole character was horrible. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie had some funny moments but the lies became so extreme and so excessive that it became ridiculous and just plain stupid by the half way point. It was unrealistic that Palmer would buy the lies and the formulaic boy/girl rom com script only hurt the film. Nicole Kidman plays Devlin, a mean girl sorority sister of Katherine's from the past who Katherine in present day still greatly resents. Of course Devlin just so happens to also be vacationing in Hawaii and runs into Katherine who then, wanting to make a good impression concocts the lie that Danny, the plastic surgeon, is her husband which creates a new set of shenanigans. <br/><br/>Lastly, the time line confused me. Palmer/Danny meet and hook up on the beach. She finds his wedding ring and wants to meet his soon to be divorced from wife. They meet and next thing I know they are on some big trip to Hawaii where Palmer is meeting Danny's fake kids and is now sort of apart of the family. Seems odd since they never even went on a date prior to the trip. It felt really rushed and weird.<br/><br/>5/10 and it's a shame because this is one film I was really looking forward to based on the previews. The only 2 really funny moments that made my laugh hard were 1, when Rachel Dratch makes a cameo as a patient of Danny's on a consultation at his practice and 2, a hula show down between Katherine/Devlin (Aniston & Kidman) that escalates into hardcore competition for a win."

For me, ""Just Go With It"" is not as good as ""Big Daddy"", ""The Wedding Singer"", ""50 First Dates"", ""Click"" or ""Anger Management"". It is better than ""Happy Madison"", ""Billy Gilmore"", ""The Waterboy"", ""8 Crazy Nights"", and ""Spanglish"". I still haven't seen ""Punch Drunk Love"", but while critics loved it, most people I know who saw it were disappointed. <br/><br/>The good points of ""Just Go With It"", were some extremely funny sight gags mostly early in the film, and lovely ladies to look at. The plot had potential, but it got bogged down with sequences that were poorly paced and didn't really connect as comedy. The two kids were quite original and good actors, adding some needed humor and a bit of pathos. The bad points were some poor acting, and, as stated before, scenes that went on too long trying to get laughs that didn't materialize, but most of all the length of the film. At nearly two hours, the movie could have used about 20 minutes removed, since the plot was fairly predictable early on. It definitely could have used tightening. <br/><br/>Overall, not a stinker as some have said, but not among Sandler's best efforts.

Danny thinks he has found THE girl, Palmer, but still can't help the lies. The next thing he knows, he's pretending Katherine is his soon to be ex and he's the dad of her kids. The boy, Michael, wants to go to Hawaii to swim with dolphins and says this in front of Palmer. So now Danny can't say no and all of them plus his weird cousin, Eddie, are off to Hawaii. In Hawaii, Danny soon bonds with the kids and sees how much he depends on Katherine, so you know the ending.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman has a small part as Devlin, the girl Katherine can't stand and lies too and tries to outdo in a hula contest.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: This is a good pick for a fun movie and time waster."
"mindgem","Null","2","5","7 October 2011"," Adam Sandle is a despicable man and plays himself in every roll
","It's very clear Adam Sandler had a sad youth with lots of disappointments and bullying but do he really have to bully back? In every roll he plays he picks on kids and he loves a setup joke where the banana peal is on the ground and he just sits and waits for someone to trip and hit his head and bleed all over and then he jumps out and laughs. That's the perfect setup for Sandler.<br/><br/>Humour of a 2 year old. Adam Sandler loves slapstick to the degree he even spoils a joke for a redneck. Without Adam Sandler this movie would have been a good 7 but with him, the very best you can ever score it is a meek 3, he really draws everything he touch in the dirt."

","At this day, 27.07.2011. this movie have a 6.3 grade. For me it is to small grade for this very good comedy. This movie is full of jokes and well written dialogs. Very funny all the time. Almost a perfect comedy, and believe me you will laugh when you watch it. Must see movie, if you wanna laugh. Adam Sendler is good as always, and the rest of actors are very good to especially Jennifer Aniston, and of course, Nicole Kidman. Two kids in a movie are also very good. Lot of movies try to be a comedy and a romantic comedy in same time, and then you laugh in first hour of movie and then, in second half hour (or whole second hour you watch a romantic part)no funny at all. The romantic part in this move is no longer than 5-6 minutes, so we can call this movie a pure comedy. This is good."

","Danny, after getting burned in a previous relationship, decides to avoid commitment by telling every girl he hooks up with that he's married.<br/><br/>But when he meets a gorgeous young girl named Palmer, he thinks she could be the one until she finds out he's ""married"".<br/><br/>So in order to keep their relationship still going, he tells her that he and his ""wife"" are getting a divorce.<br/><br/>When she insists on meeting her, he asks Katherine to pose as his wife. Katherine takes a call from one of her children, Palmer assumes that they're Danny's so wants to meet them.<br/><br/>And it's at this meeting that Katherine's son tricks Danny into taking them all on a trip to Hawaii..<br/><br/>Everyone knows what to expect from a Sandler move after 15 years, and this is no different, but it's more along the lines of 50 first dates and the wedding singer, which is no bad thing. The thing that makes this stand out though from other Sandler movies is the terrific chemistry between him and Aniston, you can really tell they are good friends off screen, and it's too the films credit.<br/><br/>There's nothing new here, all the jokes are more or less the same, and the ending is predictable, but Sandler makes movies to make people happy, and he doesn't fail at his job. He's one very lucky man, you can tell he makes films that he wants to make and that make him laugh too, which is very rare in Hollywood."

","i thought i was going to watch a mediocre movie with Adam Sandler. you know what i mean his last few have not been all that. i also thought Jennifer Aniston going to play the same character she always plays who is the loser in a bad relationship on the rebound. you know what i mean as well. well actually she does play the same character slightly better. this movie is fresh, bunch of good laughs and fun to watch. its one of those movies that you might add to your collection. on a side note Brooklyn Decker is a babe. i hope she does more films. one of the better movies out right now. watch this movie i actually recommend it and have fun."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","2","5","5 June 2011"," The title says it.
","Okay, I can't help but ask, what were people expecting? It's a comedy that stars Adam Sandler. Is it a classic (like 'Cactus Flower')? Of course not and why would anyone think otherwise? But, it is one of Sandler's better comedies, certainly, at least for me, way more enjoyable than the lacklustre 'Funny People', 'Bedtime Stories', 'Click', 'Mr. Deeds' etc.<br/><br/>There is the expected load of toilet and trashy humour which is mostly done by Nick Swardson (the worst part of this movie). Surprisingly, Sandler is less over the top than he usually is and he actually fits the part. Jennifer Aniston shines with a sincere performance in a non-challenging role. I felt hat her character wasn't properly fleshed out and she wasn't believable as a single mother of two kids mostly because of poor character and story development.<br/><br/>One of the many major flaws of 'Just Go With It' is the writing (which isn't very uncommon among Adam Sandler comedies). The romance between Katherine and Danny felt rushed as did the entire ending. Brooklyn Decker looks hot and isn't a bad actress for a hot newcomer even though, in terms of hotness, she has tough competition in the form of Jennifer Aniston who doesn't shy away from showing her amazing curves. Nick Swardson is irritating to the core and this movie would have been a whole lot better if his sequences were entirely cut out.<br/><br/>The best and funniest part of 'Just Go With It' are the sequences with Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Aniston competing with one another. Though her screen time is limited, Kidman shows that she is great with comedy. The hula competition is particularly a treat to watch.<br/><br/>The title pretty much sums it up. Don't expect too much. Just go with it and try to enjoy it at the moment, for what it is."

","I finally sat down and watched this last night as i am presently enjoying a lovely case of the flu. Once again a Happy Madison Pictures film that showcases all of Sandler's buddies in real life. I swear this guy thinks to himself and says 'You know what? I haven't seen my pals in awhile lets shoot a flick!' Although fellow buddy and SNL alumni Rob Scheneider must've missed the reunion memo. This time around Sandler portrays Danny a plastic surgeon who after having a rough childhood and earlier life of ridicule due to inheriting the family 'overly large nose' trait decides to make money of his own misfortune and become one of L.A's top plastic surgeons. Danny along with his assistant/ bff Katharine (Aniston) head to Hawaii with her two children in tow posing as his ex-wife in order to cover up a lie he has made to his much younger and very beautiful girlfriend Palmer (played by Brooklyn Decker) This parlays into the fish tale becoming increasingly bigger and bigger as the movie moves on with some hilarious scenes as a result of it. OK my own personal thoughts on this latest Sandler fare...hmmm? Well put it this way i have seen way better and still stand by my Sandler got missed at the Oscars announcement after seeing "" Love Reign Over Me"" however this is a cutesy romantic comedy that I'm sure will do better as a DVD rental then it did in it's initial theatrical release as couples journeying into the local video store are always looking for these types of films to cuddle up with on a Saturday or Sunday night. I'm rating it a 5/10."

","This movie really wasn't that funny. It had some funny parts that made me laugh out loud, but the person behind me got a lot bigger kick out of it then I did.<br/><br/>However, I enjoyed the film. It's worth watching because of the dynamic between aniston and sandler. In this film you believe these to people could really make good mates for each other.<br/><br/>It was a good part for aniston. She wasn't the gorgeous chick in this at all and had to endure old jokes from a much younger cast member. (I actually don't remember when aniston was the hot chick in any movies but I feel like she was at one point...whatever). Her character is believable. I was moved by it for whatever reason. Kind of makes you feel like Aniston was playing herself for the bit with the exception of the children...though she looked good with them.<br/><br/>and I believe the reason why the chemistry between sandler and aniston was so good was because they are the SAME AGE!!! (that did wonders for the plot and story line...you know, made it worth watching...made it believable..I think we can thank Happy Madison Productions for that). <br/><br/>Pretty tired of films where the male lead ends up with a girl 20 years his senior. Just doesn't do it for me. This one is an exception to that rule and bravo to Aniston for taking the part and bravo to Sandler for giving it to her."
"MBunge","6","2","5","14 February 2011"," Seriously, you have to just go with it.
","Like a lot of Adam Sandler comedies, Just Go With It manages to be very funny without actually being all that good. With a gossamer thin premise that even the film itself admits doesn't withstand any scrutiny, this movie throws more jokes at you in 30 seconds than many alleged comedies will have in 10 minutes and there are far more hits than misses. It's sort of like a good episode of Family Guy that just overwhelms you with silliness and naughtiness, as opposed to a bad episode of Family Guy where you're struck by how empty and arbitrary it all is.<br/><br/>Danny Maccabee (Adam Sandler) is a plastic surgeon who got his heart broken by his fiancée as a young man, only to discover that wearing a wedding ring is like catnip to a certain breed of female. With a gold band as his ultimate wingman, Danny has been boinking and running for 20 years. Now, he thinks he's fallen in genuine love with Palmer (Brooklyn Decker), a 23 year old school teacher with the mind of an angel and a body made for sin. But when she finds Danny's ring, he can't exactly tell her he's been a deceitful pig with so many women. That's when Kathryn Murphy (Jennifer Aniston), his best friend and office assistant ,comes up with the idea of Danny inventing a fake wife he's divorcing as an explanation.<br/><br/>But when Palmer demands to meet his wife, Danny has to rope Kathryn into playing the part. Then another lie gets her two kids (Bailee Madison and Griffin Gluck) involved, more deceit sends then all to Hawaii with Danny's horny dork of a cousin (Nick Swardson) in tow and then some additional deceit results in Kathryn needing Danny to pose as her husband. Would you be surprised to learn that playing husband and wife gradually makes Danny and Kathryn realize how much they care about each other, only for Palmer to then finally ask Danny to marry her? I didn't think so, though you might be surprised at the relatively unclichéd way it all turns out.<br/><br/>Let me be frank. Does this story make you believe that a middle-aged guy who looks like Adam Sandler and a 20something girl who looks like Brooklyn Decker would fall in love? No. Does it convince you that Danny and Kathryn are soulmates? Not really. Does anything here resemble stuff that could happen in real life. Hardly.<br/><br/>I don't think any of that matters because Just Go With It is pretty gosh darn funny. From nut shots and butt humor to ridiculous accents and plastic surgery sight gags to dead pan kids and somebody dropping the bionic elbow on a sick sheep, this film throws everything in the comedy kitchen at you, including a sink full of old women in grass skirts and coconut shell brassieres. If you've ever enjoyed a Sandler comedy, you'll probably laugh your behind off at this one even though Sandler is playing a relative adult who doesn't have a severe emotional or psychological problem. Jennifer Aniston also proves that her years on Friends weren't a fluke and holds her own on screen. She also demonstrates all the tabloid stories about her are bunk because there's no way the woman from those articles would have the self-confidence to go bikini vs. bikini against the amazingly proportioned Decker.<br/><br/>This is a movie where its title is also the advice you have to give to any potential viewer. If you get wrapped up in everything that's not right with this film, you'll have a terrible time. But if you just go with it, you'll have a lot of fun."

","Adam Sandler has no vocal inflection and no facial expressions. He is not remotely handsome yet over the years he has made movies with some of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Jessica Biel, Salma Hayek, Kate Beckinsale,Drew Barrymore, etc and now Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer is a pretty girl even tho she is a woman in her mid-forties. In her ""love"" scenes with Adam she plays as usual Rachel and Adam plays David Swimmer. It is really uncomfortable watching these two actors kiss and pretend they have actual feelings for each other. Everyone knows that in real life Jennifer wouldn't give Adam Sandler the time of day. Brad Pitt has very big shoes to fill. Also in this movie is Nicole Kidman who tries her hand at comedy."

","Even if you despise Adam Sandler, you probably won't mind this funny and begrudgingly charming comedy. The ensemble cast is stellar - in particular Aniston, Kidman and the brilliant young actress who plays Aniston's daughter. The typical cringeworthy Sandler teenage humour and 80s frat boy sexist tropes are littered throughout, and Sandler's way too young blonde love interest & storyline is actually sickening, but these disappointments are offset by strong and very entertaining performances from Kidman and Aniston. Plus a few very funny jokes about plastic surgery."

","I only watched this to see Kidman, and considering it's Adam Sandler, I wasn't expecting much. But wow, was this was horrible and much more painful than I had initially expected. I got an hour in until I just skimmed through and only watched the scenes that Kidman was in. Up to that point, it proved to be a completely predictable, unfunny, clichéd, and cringe-inducing movie that nearly gave me a migraine. This entire film's paper-thin premise is built around people being stupid and situations that could have easily been avoided. Sandler has absolutely no charisma, and is criminally unfunny, which tears the movie apart. I actually ended up liking and respected the antagonist in this (Kidman) more than the protagonist (Aniston). This is the result of the terrible characters and even worse portrayals. How am I supposed to believe that Sandler is a medical doctor when his vocabulary is as developed as a five-year-old?<br/><br/>The only saving graces in this was Bailee Madison who is quite a good child actor, and Nicole Kidman who I was really embarrassed for. She deserves better than this."

","We all get it, Adam Sandler is not the best actor out there as most people just love to say. But he still knows how to work in a sweet, charming, innocent rom-com such as Just Go With It. This film is actually one of his better works, in my opinion, which is not the opinion of most critics I see. But, this film had some very funny jokes and gorgeous women taking up screen time in Hawaiian paradise.<br/><br/>This film is about a plastic surgeon who gets his assistant to act as his ex-wife in order for him to get the young, gorgeous woman of his dreams. But as they all travel to paradise, is this exactly what he wants to do? <br/><br/>Adam Sandler is his typical funny self in this film. He plays his obnoxious, child-like self and I was content with that. I never saw Jennifer Aniston as gorgeous until I saw this film. Nick Swardson was really funny in his scenes. I also have to add that Bailee Madison is turning into quite the young actress.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a really funny but sweet film. It is a nice break from all those R-rated, raucous comedies that are being released in this era. I hope there are quite a few more films like these. I rate this film 9/10."
"PittsburghFilmCritic","Null","1","2","17 October 2011"," Just Go With It or Just Go Without It?
","Just Go With It, or just go without it – it really doesn't matter. The romantic comedy, Just Go With It starring Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston, and Brooklyn Decker was a truly average movie.<br/><br/>The movie was extremely predictable and it had about as many bland jokes as it did funny. Jennifer Aniston did a typically mediocre job acting and Brooklyn Decker's big-screen debut proved to be nothing special. Surprisingly enough, Adam Sandler did a fairly good job – although he was extremely convincing in a few of the more serious and emotional scenes, he tended to return to his typical man-boy humor routine in an effort to get some cheap laughs. The plot of the movie has undoubtedly overdone – a guy with an attractive long time female friend whose good looks are hidden by a myriad of easy to fix factors meets a stunning woman and attempts to woo her, only to realize his feelings for his friend. To make matters worse, the movie is presented in an unrealistic fashion – Adam Sandler appears as an unattractive compulsive liar who easily wins the hearts of two stunning and seemingly flawless women.<br/><br/>Despite these glaring flaws in the movie, Just Go With It did not go without some redeeming qualities. It had a couple of scenes that were laugh-out-loud funny, and a number of other scenes that were quite amusing. Furthermore, the movie's serious moments actually had substance – which was, considering the cast, entirely unexpected. Sandler easily made the transition from humorous to serious and skillfully portrayed a sensitive man who was great with children and was desperate for love. The movie also managed to keep the clichéd plot somewhat fresh with several surprising plot twists and amusingly unrelated scenes.<br/><br/>All things considered, I would recommend renting Just Go With It on a night when you don't feel like watching anything heavy. It is an average movie worth watching for a few laughs, but it doesn't offer much more."

","Katherine (Aniston) is plastic surgeon Danny's longtime assistant, who agrees to help Danny to deceive Palmer, and of course it gets complicated. When the web of lies expands to include Katherine's children, her daughter Maggie (Madison), who wants to be an actress, sees it all as a fun exercise in improv. This adds another, entertaining level to the premise: what if the Whose Line Is It Anyway comedians had to fool an audience member into thinking the sketch was real? Members of Just Go With It's makeshift acting troop slip up or make ill-considered choices, and the others are forced to accept the challenge and ""just go with it"" in order to keep their increasingly intricate collaborative work of fiction from contradicting itself. I didn't laugh out loud, but I suspect I was as amused as most people are when they disingenuously type ""lol"" online.<br/><br/>Sandler's affinity for children (he has two) shows in his scenes with his two young cast mates, and Aniston is charming, as she's been in every role in which I've seen her. The romantic side of this romantic comedy keeps to the usual template, for the most part, but I knew that going in, and the same old thing is done well.<br/><br/>Why you should see it: You like sweet fluff, when it's done fairly well.<br/><br/>Why you shouldn't see it: You fear cinematically-induced diabetes. You were hoping for a heartbreaking death scene or a horrific murder. <br/><br/>--from my review at www.1man365movies.com"

Still I was expecting this movie to pull through because of Adam Sandler. Sadly this was not the case.<br/><br/>First of all the premise itself is not good. Adam Sandler is a bachelor carries a fake wedding ring and pretends to be in a dying marriage to get laid. However when he meets Brooklyn Decker, he wants to get serious with her. She discovers his fake ring and instead of telling the truth he convinces his receptionist Jennifer Aniston to play his fake wife.<br/><br/>Now here is the thing, what happens when Brooklyn Decker decides to visit him in his office. Wouldn't she notice the wife working in the office ? It is not as if the filmmakers don't know the issue, Jennifer Aniston's character even comments about it in the movie. But no reasonable explanation is given. Then we get fake kids. I am just curious how long would that arrangement have gone on. Would Sandler get visitation rights ?<br/><br/>Well it is comedy and you are supposed to forget about the plot, but regrettably this film has no laughs. Also there is zero chemistry between Sandler and Aniston to justify the ending."

Just go with it has its funny moments, and the two leads are always likable, but the film is dumbed down by its predictability and clichés.<br/><br/>Sandler plays a plastic surgeon who, with every girl, pretends that hes married and it somehow helps him because they think he's responsible. But he meets a babe(Brooklyn Dekker) and has to fake a family. So, he uses his assistant(Anniston) and her kids to help him perform this charade.<br/><br/>Its all leading to Hawaii, where his charade gets more and more ridiculous.

I thought this was better than Grown ups and Bedtime stories, but its going to be hard for Sandler to top Funny people.

"stampe128","7","1","3","25 June 2011"," Surprisingly good, though quite typical.
","Let me start out by saying that I'm by no means an Adam Sandler fan, not so much because of him but mainly because of his choices in acting as well as his co-actors (I absolutely despised 'Grown Ups' with Kevin James and the ever-so abysmal Rob Schneider, as well as 'Waterboy'). As such I had no expectations to the quality of 'Just Go With It' whatsoever. And on the surface I should've probably hated this movie as the overall plot, and especially the plot development, is no different than any other romantic comedy: *SPOILER*(or not so much a spoiler, actually) - Man meets girl, falls in love with girl, gets help from female friend, falls in love with female friend. Ring any bells?<br/><br/>So it comes as no surprise that it is not the plot that drives the movie, but rather the chemistry between the three main characters Dannie, Kathrine and Eddie. It feels right, and not for a single second was I bored (not for more than a few minutes at least). Quite an achievement taken the movie's incredible length. The script really saved the movie for me, and only major low-point is the clichéd ending (and Sandler's role. What is the deal with Adam Sandler. He is by no means a super attractive man and neither a bad-ass... still he tends to play both - One of Hollywood's greatest mysteries).<br/><br/>Admitted, I laughed a lot even though I saw it by myself. Swardson's character is awesome - again a typical character who's saved by a great script. And this goes for almost everything about the film. Truly a great enjoyment, though not my type of movie at ALL. So... I guess the only thing left to say is ""Just Go With It"" (corny, I know)."

","Well now, my review hath disappeared. Let's give it another shot, shall we? Adam Sandler plays a surgeon who flies to Hawaii accompanied by his assistant (Aniston), whom he asks to pose as his ex-wife. Don't ask. Ultimately, he plans to marry his girlfriend (Decker), who is 20 years his junior. While in Hawaii, Aniston runs across an old college foe, the haughty (and barely recognizable) Nicole Kidman, and pretends to be married to Sandler to tweak her rival. Complications obviously ensue. Lots of funny bits, including an hysterical hula contest that turns into a showdown between Aniston and Kidman. We have to pretend that Aniston isn't the most attractive woman on Earth, as her character here is divorced and has two children. She and Sandler have wonderful chemistry, I might add. And the ending is a hoot. Good movie for grownups, which is rare these days."

","Everyone who thought Adam Sandler finally got it (with Spanglish and Punch Drunk Love) a couple of years ago, may be confused why he still goes for the obvious and not challenging route of those comedies. But that shouldn't be the point here. If you go into this movie expecting an acting Sandler (can also be seen in Reign over me), you will most definitely be disappointed! <br/><br/>On the other hand, if you go into this just expecting to be entertained, you will get the most out of it. I still couldn't enjoy it as much (it's too light, the jokes seem by the numbers, the funny side kick friend is too cliché and even Ms. Kidman feels misplaced in this) as I wanted to. But Brooklyn Decker alone is worth the 5 points. Jennifer Aniston is trying, but not as funny as she can be. The kids are as annoying as they are supposed to be (in the script). Family fun, nothing more, nothing less."

A Plastic surgeon creates a web of deceit, involving his assistant, her children and friend to impress a young woman who he thinks is the one. The whole concept is ridiculous and Sandler finds himself digging out hole after hole to cover all his lies. <br/><br/>It is the same brand of humour and old faithful guest appearances that Sandler is known for. I failed to see any original jokes or comedy that has not been done in his movies before. I did get a giggle at a subtle jibe at Heidi Montag, who had a guest appearance as a partygoer, in a room full of people who had become disfigured from overdoing it on cosmetic surgery. <br/><br/>Then the movie gets corny and Sandler delivers his traditional happy ending where everyone involved comes out smiling. <br/><br/>The movie is OK; there is something familiar and oddly comforting about Sandler movies for me, so I always endeavour to see them.

I kept waiting to feel SOME emotion, ANY emotion other than aggravation. I am mostly a devout fan of both Adam Sandler and Jennifer Annistan, but this movie almost led to my death. The ONLY part I found enjoyable is when Devlyn, Ian, Katherine, and Danny had dinner and Devlyn talked them into saying what they loved about each other. That was the only 2 minutes in the movie that had any positive emotion, whatsoever. It seemed too desperate an attempt at slapstick humor and things going awry to connect to the characters.. or even recognize their connection to each other. I was so hoping for more, but was very let down. Unlike overboard, where I turned it off 5 minutes into the film, I felt obligated to sit through it and watch it because I ordered it OnDemand at my boyfriends house and couldn't bear wasting the money by not finishing it.

","There was a time when Adam Sandler made some pretty funny movies. He has starred in such hits as Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore and 50 First Dates. Sadly, those movies were all made early in his film career. As Sandler has gotten older, his movies have gotten a lot less funny. Just Go with It is his most recent movie to fail in being funny. In Just Go with It, directed by frequent Sandler collaborator Dennis Dugan, Sandler stars as Danny Maccabee, a plastic surgeon, bachelor and lover of women. Jennifer Aniston is Katherine, Danny's surgical assistant and single mother of two. Aniston looks fantastic, and provides a few minor spots in which she makes you laugh, but regrettably how she looks is what she'll be most remembered for. Brooklyn Decker, the buxom Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, makes her acting debut as Palmer. Lacking the humor of Aniston, Decker is merely there for the purpose of looking incredible, and often is seen in a very skimpy bikini. Nick Swardson, playing Danny's Cousin Eddie is laughable at times, but more often than not leans more towards corny. The stars of the film, without a doubt, are Bailee Madison and Griffin Gluck who play Maggie and Michael, Katherine's children. The youngsters are pleasantly funny, without feeling forced, and have most of the funniest lines and are in most of the funniest scenes. Supporting appearances are made by Nicole Kidman and Dave Matthews; both are equally forgettable. A lot of potential, but none of which was reached.<br/><br/>Filmed mostly on the Hawaiian island of Maui, Just Go with It has a gorgeous backdrop. The resort the film takes place at, and the women in the movie are beautiful. However as a whole, the movie is highly predictable. Sandler no longer has the appeal he once had while making pictures that we more juvenile. Sandler has become just another male actor trying his hands at romantic comedies. The problem is that most male actors are fairly attractive making the premise somewhat believable, whereas Sandler just doesn't fit the description. He's not someone that women are anticipating seeing without his shirt on, ala Matthew McConaughey. Sandler is an entertaining individual, and I believe that he can still be funny and juvenile. However, every person comes to a point in their life that when they decide it's time to grow up and it's beginning to feel like Sandler has come to that point. If that's the case, then these types of movies are going to become the norm and not the exception.<br/><br/>Grade: C <br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"

"EUyeshima","6","1","4","5 March 2011"," Deception-Based Farce Gone Through the Sandler Blender
","There is no getting around the fact that Jennifer Aniston is likable. In the past, she has attempted to be versatile with mixed results (effective in ""The Good Girl"", less so as a temptress in ""Derailed""), but she remains most successful within a limited proximity of her Rachel Green character from the long-running ""Friends"" TV series. She's playing another variation of her in this rambunctious 2011 comedy ever so loosely based on the amiable 1969 farce, ""Cactus Flower"" starring Walter Matthau, Ingrid Bergman, and Goldie Hawn in her Oscar-winning debut. Believe it or not, Aniston is playing the Bergman role of Katherine, a single mom working as an assistant to Danny, a successful LA plastic surgeon played by Adam Sandler. The fact that Sandler is playing the Matthau role appears to be the primary joke here since he turns the excessively inventive single doctor into one of his standard wiseacre man-boy characters.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a flashback scene in which a pre-nose-job Danny discovers he is about to marry a shrew but soon realizes his gold band is a magnet for hot chicks. He then decides to avoid what he thinks is the inevitable disappointment of commitment by telling every girl he hooks up with that he's married. That ploy changes when he meets a blonde stunner named Palmer. He falls for her, but things start to fall apart when she discovers Danny's gold band in his pocket and assumes he's married. Convinced that Palmer is the one, Danny persuades Katherine to pretend to be his soon-to-be-ex-wife and uses her two manipulative kids as part of the charade. Things go according to formula, including a contrived trip to Hawaii where Katherine runs into a college sorority rival named Devlin, who has been the subject of Katherine's passive-aggressive hostilities all these years. In a bit of stunt casting, Nicole Kidman plays the ultra-competitive Devlin in a comically imperious fashion, while singer/musician Dave Matthews is arbitrarily thrown in the mix as her equally shallow, butt-clenching husband.<br/><br/>Even though this comedy is neither as consistently funny nor tightly structured as ""Cactus Flower"", I have to admit there is a bit of a Cary Grant/Irene Dunne-type of banter between Aniston and Sandler, at least during the first half when Katherine is introduced to Palmer as Danny's confident, materialistic wife (she names herself ""Devlin""). These are the scenes that hew closest to the original movie and consequently work the best. Where it flounders is when the two actors need to show they are falling in love. Sandler is a relative blank slate during these more serious moments, and the lack of credibility in their characters' romantic relationship undermines the film. In the Goldie Hawn role, Brooklyn Decker fulfills the physical requirements as Palmer but is unlikely to be up for any Oscars this time next year. Nick Swardson wins my award for the year's most irritating best buddy in a Sandler comedy, especially when he pretends to be Katherine's lover, an Austrian sheep buyer. Sandler's former SNL colleagues Rachel Dratch and an almost unrecognizable Kevin Nealon show up in cameos as two comically unfortunate victims of plastic surgery."

Sandler is not amazing, but he is not as irritating as he can be. Anniston's role is one-dimensional, but she is beguiling and the chemistry they have is likable. Nicky Swardson, who I can't stand usually, is also good. The film looks appealing, is directed assuredly and the soundtrack is fitting and not too generic. The script however while having some funny and tender moments has a number of weak moments coming across as stilted and cloying. The story is rather thin and predictable especially the ending, and the characters while appealingly performed are generally under-developed and stereotyped.

"musanna-ahmed","5","1","5","13 February 2011"," The dumb version of Love and Other Drugs
","There's a scene in Just Go With It where Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) answers a phone call and speaks in a high pitched voice. Once the phone call ends, Danny (Adam Sandler) mocks her high pitch. In the theatre, a roar of high pitched laughter went up. Basically, it was comedy gold for children. In fact, it appeared that there were plenty of moments of comedy gold for children.<br/><br/>Yet a lot of those jokes are sexual. Fair enough that they would need parental guidance but it honestly can be said that this is an inappropriate film for youngsters. However, simultaneously it could be considered as harmless fun and perhaps the film of choice for any families wanting to see a film on Valentine's Day.<br/><br/>What makes Just Go With It actually funny is its stupidity. The Dennis Dugan plus Adam Sandler formula which has been going on for years is at work once again in Just Go With It. Unfortunately that means Sandler is yet again a limited, witless, character, staying as a crass plastic surgeon from the beginning to the end that doesn't have half the brain of Jake Gyllenhall's pharmaceutical rep in Love and Other Drugs. As for Nick Swardson and Jennifer Aniston who embody a different persona to go with the great lie, their alternate persona's – Dolph Lundgren and Devlin – are amusing in a ridiculous manner. One has a dire German accent and the other delivers lines that get no better than ""Oh, I forgot, you're 15"" in retaliation to a question asked by Palmer (Brooklyn Decker).<br/><br/>The romantic side of the film proved to be a tear jerker in the same theatre as teenage girls broke down about the same time as Katherine, even though the non-developing characters don't build a great sense of sentimentality in the film. The plot on the whole feels like a first draft – it isn't really established as well as it could have been and the childish jokes were probably because of the first rule of improv that was listened to by the screenwriters – accept what they say and just go along with it. The title of this film certainly shows that.<br/><br/>Considering the content of Just Go With It, it may just be THE film of choice for families this Valentine's Day. Whether there are members in the family who are looking for a simple film driven by a simple plot, jokes and characters, one with many sex-related jokes, or if they are avid Adam Sandler fans, there is something on offer here. However for those looking for an 'important' film, then don't Go With It.<br/><br/>Verdict: Just Go With It if you're looking for a guilty pleasure or the kids want to visit the pictures."

Come on, I am having some fun, just go with it! Let me go back to the narrative of ""Just Go With It"". Because of plastic-lies surgeon Danny's continuous lies & fabrication, a lot of silly stuff transpires in the movie which leads the film's characters into Hawaii, even though there was not much Alo ha ha ha in those scenes. Now there were a few that I went with and made me chuckle, but not nearly enough. Sandler and Aniston looked like they were simply just ""going with it"" to collect a paycheck. News Flash: Decker is not the second coming of Michelle Pfeiffer but she is sure one that could cause many other second comings, we will just leave it at that. Nick Swardson's performance as Danny's cousin Eddie is deserving of the MOCAT Award, that would be playing the ""Most Obnoxious Character of All Time""; even though I have to admit that his sheep scene was not a piece of .

Oh, and Tom Cruise's ex also shows up in this one also; and I am not talking about Mimi Rogers, Katie Holmes (eventually that will happen), or Ms. Scientology (look at last parentheses comment). I am not kidding, Kidman is in this movie, and is not a cameo either. ""Just Go With It"" was actually scribed by two screenwriters, Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling. I guess it does take two to make a word thing go wrong. OK, it was not that bad, there were a few zingers here and there that made me laugh; but again not nearly enough!

","Although Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler are not the caliber of Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant, they are a well-matched comedic couple in Just Go with It. When they're not engaged in a typical rom-com moment that makes them a loving couple (sorry about the spoiler, but you knew it anyway), they are scrappy and witty, making me almost believe they don't love each other.<br/><br/>This story of plastic surgeon Danny (Sandler) having his assistant, Katherine (Aniston), act as his divorcing wife so he can snag 23-year-old-hottie Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) is boilerplate rom-com, but not bad at that. The slapstick and repartee are sometimes above average, and Sandler with Katherine's two children is right at home at what he does best: kind-hearted and funny and always ready to let the child actors upstage him. <br/><br/>For instance, Bailee Madison as Katherine's daughter, Maggie, steals scenes with her fake Brit accent and overall chutzpah emanating from her strong personality first evident in Disney's Bridge to Terabithia. Sandler is brilliant with her, playing off her aggressiveness with his own low-key but smart responses. He brings out the best in everyone every time he relinquishes control of the scene.<br/><br/>It's a good film as well that lets Nicole Kidman goof a little as Katherine's college rival; the two facing off in a Hawaiian hip-swaying contest is an amusing display of talent and toning, not bad at all for ladies who are getting as long in the tooth as Sandler. Not all the secondary characters are as fun: Comic relief from Nick Swardson as silly buddy Eddie is tediously forced.<br/><br/>The comedy has all the requisite turns of the genre, all the clichés, and all the telegraphed twists. However, Just Go with It is a pleasant surprise in this movie dead zone before the Oscar winner announcements."
